        "mainbody": "raul was an orc leader in Dead Orc Pass in the Silver Marches.\nGraul was a large orc.\nGraul was a follower of Gruumsh, but he was not very religious. Nevertheless, he was very crafty and knew how to use his peoples superstitions against them.\nHe raided caravans that came through the Dead Orc Pass, but the blind ranger Montolio Debrouchee often stood in his way. His tribes shaman was superstitious of Montolio, calling him an omen of bad magic In 1341 DR, Graul had under his command 1,000 fighters (including orcs, worgs, and giants) and controlled half of the valley. That year, he became aware of the presence of the drow Drizzt DoUrden. Unsure of whether he was a scout or a renegade, he ordered his minions to keep their distance from the drow. But as Drizzt remained in the valley throughout the winter, Graul, fearing a potential rival seeking to usurp his throne, sent two patrols to kill him but they were unsuccessful due to Montolios interference.\nGraul remained unaware of Drizzts exact whereabouts until he was approached by the bounty hunter Roddy McGristle, who convinced him (through monetary payment) to mount an attack against Montolios home in Mooshies Grove. Having probable cause to attack the grove as retaliation for Montolios aiding of the drow, Graul begun his siege during the new moon with the shamans blessing from Gruumsh One-eye. The attack failed, and Graul and the survivors turned on McGristle he easily escaped, however."
