Sirge de La Sunya, more commonly known as "the Watcher", was an adventuring paladin of Helm who hailed from the noble Athkatlan family – House de La Sunya.
Sirge was a tall human male in appearance. He had well-kept facial hair and could often be seen wielding a longsword and a shield.
Sirge de La Sunya was born to a noble Helmite family of Athkatla, Amn. He remained a loyal member of House de La Sunya until his fathers, Don DiArmoss death, sometime before the . On his deathbed, the patriarch of de La Sunya clan revealed that he had a daughter, born in the faraway land of Damara. The childs mother was a disguised demon who was slain by Don DiArmos. He was unwilling to slay a newborn and ended up leaving the abomination with the monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
Shaken by the revelation, Sirge abandoned duties to his family and left the city of Athkatla, accompanied by his loyal squire, friend, and teacher, Kepp Trapmaster. The duo were the first members of the adventuring fellowship of The Winter Rose. The name was picked to signify the resilience of frostrose that bloomed despite the harshest winters of the North Faerûn. Eventually, by chance, the duo was joined by a half-elven druid Tianya. After that, Sirge de La Sunya reunited with his long-lost sister, who was eager to see the world outside of her cloistered life. The tiefling monk named Naleen did not know that her new companions were led by her brother as the only name Sirge gave her was "the Watcher".
The last two comrades who joined Sirge and his fellowship were Llendril Coe and Dalwynd Meadsbreath. Together, the group built their name and became known as self-proclaimed defenders of the north.
