        "mainbody": "'''Tormstar the Scarred''' was an [[assassin]] of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]] and a deep-cover [[Harper]] spy.",
        "History": "Tormstar was a ranger living peacefully in [[Battledale]], in the [[Dalelands]], with his wife until a [[werewolf]] started terrorizing the dale. Tormstar pursued and tracked the beast and, after a furious fight, destroyed the werewolf, only to discover that the beast was in fact his wife.\n\nScarred both in mind and body, he abandoned his [[ranger]] career and volunteered to join the Night Masks as a deep-cover spy for the Harpers, a suicide mission. He joined the Masks but, to everyone's surprise, he not only survived but also rose through the ranks, finding himself to be a very good assassin. His superiors in Those Who Harp wondered if Tormstar might not enjoy his life in [[Westgate]] too much, although he infrequently sent reports to them."
