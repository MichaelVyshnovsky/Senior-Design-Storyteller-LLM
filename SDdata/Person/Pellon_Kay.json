        "mainbody": "'''Pellon Kay''' was a musician from the country of [[Sembia]].",
        "Personality": "Pellon was known to be very confrontational and prone to toxic banter.",
        "History": "Pellon Kay was born and raised in the country of Sembia to a family full of gifted musicians. However, growing up he never took his performances seriously. The personality he developed led Pellon to accrue a great deal of enemies, numbering in the dozens. Many sages theorized that the goddess of music [[Milil]] frowned upon his behavior, but that the god of destruction [[Talos]] found it to be quite amusing.\n\nAn [[avatar]] of Talos was said to have one night stood in a tavern and watch as Pellon started a fight with over twenty men. As he laid on the ground unconscious, Telos sought to reward him for his efforts in spreading such destruction. Telos placed his hands upon Pellon's [[lute]] and he discovered the next time he played it that the instrument had been [[item enchantment|enchanted]], allowing him to to drive men into a berserker frenzy just by playing in their direction. An effect similar to the [[spell]] ''[[dire charm]]''.\n\nFor the next several weeks that followed, Pellon took great delight in sparking fights between mercenaries and sailors. Eventually, an unknown [[warrior]] with a grim expression on his face murdered Pellon with a [[crossbow]] before he could get close enough to use his lute. Afterwards, the warrior threw his enchanted lute into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Eventually, this lute ended up in the hands of the [[elven]] merchant [[Lehland]] of the [[Severed Hand|Hand of Seldarine]]. Following his transformation into a [[ghost]], Lehland was still looking for a prospective buyer by [[1281 DR]]."
