'''X. Scuttermoore''' was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Scuttermoore owned a wrinkly pet [[pug]] [[dog]].

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Guild]] of Baldur's Gate targeted X. Scuttermoore, presumably as part of the Guild's protection racket or unpaid debts. When Scuttermoore began running low on coin, the Guild claimed their deposit box key from the [[Counting House]]; however, that did not stop harassment and demands of payment by the agents of the Guild.
