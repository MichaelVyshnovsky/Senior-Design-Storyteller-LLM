Eight was a goblin child that lived in the Shattered Sanctum, a fortress of the Cult of the Absolute.
Eight wore a leather helmet and a crude cuirass that was fastened by a rope.
The goblin was very aggressive despite being so young.
In the late 15 century DR, Eights was made an orphan when his parents were murdered by a soldier of the Flaming Fist during his camps raid of the Waukeens Rest inn. The young goblin claimed to have killed the man, and then took out their rage on the corpse of the alleged murderer. Eight claimed that they were better off without their parents anyway.
