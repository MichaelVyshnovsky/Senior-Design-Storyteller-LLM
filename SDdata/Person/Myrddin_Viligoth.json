        "History": "Myrddin born in [[Thay]] with attitude to magic; like all similar gifted children of that land he was enrolled in the tower of a [[Red Wizard]] to learn all about magic. He was a good student and become a powerful wizard in time; but his heart was not filled with evil like all his fellow red wizards. So Myrddin, having finally understanding the evil of the red wizards ways, gave the courage to escape Thay. He arrived in Damara just after the demise of [[Zhengyi]], hoping to teach the [[Damaran]] about evilness of Thay. First he was welcomed with suspects and doubts but finally the wizard [[Emelyn the Gray]] took Myrddin under his wings. The two founded the [[Twilight Riders]], a group of wandering heroes that travel the south of Damara solving problems and fighting evil.",
        "Personality": "Myrddin was a very private person; only recently he converted to the Ilmater faith and was very enthusiast about his new god. He tolerate different religions path, unless conduct to evil."
