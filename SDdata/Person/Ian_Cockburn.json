        "mainbody": "Ian Cockburn was a shopkeeper in Phlan in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nIan was the owner of the eponymous grocery shop located in the residential district.\nIan was a welcoming man with a wide smile. He was known for his fair prices, but wasnt one to bargain much.\nCockburn was in possession of, and possessed by, a strange artifact which he found in his cellar. When the artifact overtook him, the shopkeeper felt the irresistible impulse to kill. He usually satisfied this need on unsuspecting adventurers&mdashbut on one occasion killed his wife, which he was openly grieving."
