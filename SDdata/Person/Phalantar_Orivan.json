He dealt regularly with adventurers and wizards and sponsored adventuring parties in exchange for a share of their loot, particular goods he could sell in his shop, and funded some mercenary companies for part of their profits. Phalantar was also known to buy magic items for 40% of their value, without asking questions. With all this business, he became incredibly rich."
