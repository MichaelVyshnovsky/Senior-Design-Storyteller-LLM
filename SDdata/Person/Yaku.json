        "mainbody": "Yaku was an ancient earth spirit from the jungles of the Malatran Plateau who resided on the Yaku Plains, active millennia before the late 14 century DR.\nYaku came into existence on the Malatran Plateau a millennia before the 14 century DR, alongside his brother, Kuya. Yaku made his home the Yaku Plains, west of the Fire Mountain â€“ the home of Kuya.\nEventually, a mysterious calamity incinerated Yaku Plains, ancient to the Nubari of the 14 century DR. It was believed that ancient dark magic, similar to those imbued into the fabled Necromancers Stone was responsible for the disaster. With the plains death, Yaku left the Prime Material plane or died with the land, leaving nothing but pain in the land behind.\nIn the Year of Tigers Curse on the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle came across Yakus brother. The earth spirit felt his brothers absence, and his sadness was turned into despair when the Mother of a Thousand Young who inhabited the Fire Mountain began poisoning nature around. Yakus fate was unknown to Kuya, as well as it remained unrecorded whether the heroes revealed the history of the Yaku Plains disaster to the lonely spirit."
