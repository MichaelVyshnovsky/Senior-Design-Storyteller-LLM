        "mainbody": "Elfinster, also known as El, operated the small establishment known as the School of the Mage of Shadowdale in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nEl was a human ajami mage who called himself the \"Mage of Shadowdale.\"\nHe would get very prickly if anyone confused him with Elminster or called him by that name, often refusing to deal with them unless they apologized profusely.\nThe wizard decided to get as far away from Shadowdale as possible in order to avoid comparison with \"the other mage of Shadowdale.\" El eventually settled in Huzuz, where he married Amsha al-Lanim and opened his establishment."
