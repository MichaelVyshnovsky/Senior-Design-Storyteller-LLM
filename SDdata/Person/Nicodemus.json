        "mainbody": "Nicodemus was a sage and wizard who lived in the Stiltways of Yhaunn in the 14 century DR.\nThe old sage had gray hair and a beard, with a bald spot developing atop his head. He had a habitual smile and a twinkle in his blue-gray eyes that made him look as if he was up to some sort of mischief.\nNicodemus was quite clever and thoughtful, though also very absent-minded and messy.\nAs a wizard of some small power, Nicodemus knew a collection of handy spells for work and self-defense, including comprehend languages, detect magic, sleep, knock, and mirror image.\nHis home and office was a cluttered mess of papers and trinkets that covered every surface.\nIn addition to his mundane scholarly supplies and resources, Nicodemus held a +1 ring of protection, a +1 dagger, a quill of everflowing ink, and a number of pills of water breathing.\nNicodemus lived in his shop in the Stiltways, providing services to the local population. He translated documents, bought and resold unusual books, wrote letters for the illiterate, and cast minor magics on demand. Although quite competent at his work, he was scatter-minded enough that he he was only ever just able to support himself.\nIn the 1360s DR, Nicodemus was approached by adventurers seeking his expertise regarding a navigators rutter on behalf of Marla Wyverhold. During the negotiations over the items worth, Nicodemus became quite flustered and accidentally knocked a candle onto the book, scorching it slightly. This revealed the invisible ink on the otherwise blank pages, revealing instructions that lead to the Oracle at Sumbar."
