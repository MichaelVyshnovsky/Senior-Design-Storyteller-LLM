        "mainbody": "'''Nicodemus''' was a sage and [[wizard]] who lived in the [[Stiltways]] of [[Yhaunn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The old sage had gray hair and a beard, with a bald spot developing atop his head. He had a habitual smile and a twinkle in his blue-gray eyes that made him look as if he was up to some sort of mischief.",
        "Personality": "Nicodemus was quite clever and thoughtful, though also very absent-minded and messy.",
        "Abilities": "As a wizard of some small power, Nicodemus knew a collection of handy spells for work and self-defense, including ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[knock]]'', and ''[[mirror image]]''.",
        "Possessions": "His home and office was a cluttered mess of papers and trinkets that covered every surface.\n\nIn addition to his mundane scholarly supplies and resources, Nicodemus held a ''+1 [[ring of protection]]'', a ''+1 [[dagger]]'', a ''[[quill of everflowing ink]]'', and a number of ''[[pill of water breathing|pills of water breathing]]''.",
        "Activities": "Nicodemus lived in his shop in the Stiltways, providing services to the local population. He translated documents, bought and resold unusual books, wrote letters for the illiterate, and cast minor magics on demand. Although quite competent at his work, he was scatter-minded enough that he he was only ever just able to support himself.",
        "History": "In the 1360s DR, Nicodemus was approached by [[adventurer]]s seeking his expertise regarding a navigator's [[rutter]] on behalf of [[Marla Wyverhold]]. During the negotiations over the item's worth, Nicodemus became quite flustered and accidentally knocked a [[candle]] onto the book, scorching it slightly. This revealed the invisible [[ink]] on the otherwise blank pages, revealing instructions that lead to the [[Oracle at Sumbar]]."
