        "mainbody": "'''Orgelna Highshield''' was a famed artist of [[Selgaunt]], considered to be the most prestigious sculptor of [[Sembia]] by some in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Orgelna was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] woman with a lush beard and surly demeanor. She wore cartoonishly thick [[spectacles]].",
        "History": "Orgelna Highshield's work was an impressive sight: a bushy-bearded dwarvish woman scampering and climbing over slabs of rock she was chiseling, often spending nights sleeping atop her sculptures. She was a favored sculptor by many Selgauntian [[human]] noble families, including [[Bowsuntide]] and [[Ornwindsea]] clans."
