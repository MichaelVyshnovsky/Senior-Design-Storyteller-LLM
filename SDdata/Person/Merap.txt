'''Merap "Dead-eyed"''' was a member of the [[Company of the Anvil]] adventuring company in [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Merap received his nickname "Dead-eyes" from his ugly appearance. His head was bald.

==Personality==
Merap smiled a lot but always with a cold emotionless smile.

==Possessions==
Merap wore throwing [[dagger]]s on his belt.

==Relationships==
Merap was the brother of [[Maera]], the second in command of the Company.

==History==
Merap and his sister were old allies of [[Bramas Thorntree]], like all in the Company of the Anvil.

In 1370 DR, he joined the Company, and together they recovered the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' from a long-forgotten [[dwarven]] tomb in the [[Starspire Mountains]]. They had been ordered to maintain a low profile and, on their return journey on [[Uktar 10]], stopped at the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]] for drink.

Later that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''Sondarr Scepter''. However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company. Merap joined in the brawl. Bramas used the opportunity to escape with the ''scepter'', but the dwarves eventually caught up with him and recovered it.
