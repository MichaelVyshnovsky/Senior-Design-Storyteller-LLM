Nasana Melnuthquel was the Magister from  to . Formerly a princess of Procalith in Tashalar, she installed her lover on the throne so as to free herself to discharge her Magister duties she died of heartstop in 297 DR after slaying her lovers wife.
Nasana was proud, witty, and uncharacteristically bold. When roused to vengeance, however, she was indiscriminate and relentless.
Nasana possessed spells capable of keeping a foe alive even as they were reduced to bloody shapelessness. By the end of her tenure, she was also powerful enough to slay mages across Faerûn.
Early in her tenure as the Magister, Nasana dropped unannounced on any mage with a tower, and demanded a trade of spells, usually two for two. By the end of her tenure, after the death of Auglad, she was instead slaying mages and their servants indiscriminately.
When Nasana became the Magister, she installed her lover on the throne as a puppet ruler. Later, she fell in love with Ilitmur Auglad, into whose tower she snuck.
After accepting the office of the Magister from Azuth, Nasana installed her lover as a puppet ruler, and spent some time going across Faerûn, dropping in on mages towers to offer spell trades. Though she had to flee frantically at least twice, she encountered Ilitmur Auglad in this process the frail Netherese refugee and her began a romance.
They spent several years together, until an archmage assaulted and slew the refuge. After torturing and killing him, she changed her approach to the business of the Magister, indiscriminately planning and carrying out the slaying of every wizard she could. During this task, she returned to Procalith, where she discovered her old lover had taken a wife, Osalra, who was also a mage of minor skill. She slew the woman, but died of heartstop moments later. Her body was burned by Sabral Faryre, who immediately proclaimed himself the Magister.
