        "mainbody": "Gharizol () was a barbed devil who lived in service to Archduke Zariel. He made it his calling to exact vengeance upon the mortals of Faer√ªn in her name, during the late 15 century DR.\nGharizol was consumed with power and wholly egomaniacal. He held nothing but utter contempt for mortals of the Realms.\nThe fiendish being could communicate telepathically with mortals, as well as temporarily possess their bodies and speak through their voices.\nLike other barbed devils, Gharizol was resistant to the effects of cold, and was not easily harmed by non-magical weapons. He could not be harmed by fire of flame, and was immune to the effects of all poisons.\nHis only possession was a small leather pouch that held a single soul coin.\nGharizol was served by many of Zariels cultists, including Vollis Foote, and other unwitting servants like the unassuming Harwin Lamlin.\nAfter Elturel was pulled down into Avernus in the , Gharizol believed the time was right exact revenge on that citys famed guardians, the Hellriders. Gharizol believed the mortal soldiers abandoned Zariel when she was a solar during their legendary crusade into the Nine Hells. The same year Elturel breifly descended to the Hells, Gharizol dispatched his minions to the Western Heartlands to slay the moral descendents of the Hellariders and punish the souls of their forebears.\nFirst, Gharizol manipulated the humble dressmaker Harwin Lamlin into murdering Markus Hallgate\nA short time later, the cult of Zariel performed a ritual in her temple in the sewer system of Baldurs Gate to summon Gharizol into the city. It involved the ritual sacrifice of nine individuals, and a specific spell uncovered by her servants.\nEventually, the Flaming Fist uncovered the secrets of Gharizols origin,\nGharizol finally appeared with a group of his cutlists to assault a warehouse on Stormshore Street, near the docks of Baldurs Gate, where refugees from Elturel were being sheltered. Two descendents of the ancient Hellriders, Segren Hall and Wellum Smith, were among the Elturgardians within. A group of adventurers bravely came to the refugees defense, defeating the cultists and slaying Gharizol on the Prime. After the battle the adventures were approached by a servant of Ilmater named Dara, flanked by two angels, the planetar Rinzel, and a goat-legged deva named Ausuriel."
