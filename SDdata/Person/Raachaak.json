        "mainbody": "'''General Raachaak''' was a power-hungry [[balor]] who sought to capture a legendary [[bloodforge]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''It's not whether you win or lose that counts, it's how much pain you inflict along the way.''}}",
        "Description": "Towering General Raachaak appeared similar to other balors. He had huge bony wings, massive musculature, jagged claws, amber-colored eyes, and oily thick leathery crimson skin. His weapon of choice was his demonic serpentine whip of many tails, speckled with [[obsidian]] shards.",
        "Personality": "Raachaak was evil and sadistic, and like the rest of his kin, ambitious. He resented most creatures and would retaliate with extreme cruelty for the mere act of questioning him.",
        "History": "In [[1371 DR]]{{DDTS}}, the [[vrock]]s [[Morbaat]], [[Shaakat]], and [[Rejik]] were ordered by General Raachaak to find a way into the ancient and recently resettled city in the [[Utter East]] that contained a fabled [[bloodforge]]. When the general gave his subservient vrocks instructions to head to [[Toril]], Morbaat stood out of line and asked Raachaak if the vrocks would be better off capturing the bloodforge instead of simply scouting the way into the city. In punishment, the vrock was stomped into the ground by the general and slashed with his fiery whip until she stopped screaming and ceased convulsing in agony.\n\nRachaak planned on using the power of the bloodforge to conjure countless warriors out of thin air and overrun [[Baator]]. But in order to do so, he needed his servants to find a way around the new denizens' wards against all [[tanar'ri]].\n\nEven though Shaakat and Rejik indeed found a way into the cityâ€”a ''[[portal]]'' that lay in the [[Sargauth Level]] of [[Undermountain]], the tanar'ri's ambition and greed led to the vrocks' confrontation with the [[paladin]]s of [[Tyr]] trying to reach the same ''portal''. The vrocks failed miserably, as the confrontation led to the portal being buried under the collapsed tunnel. General Rachaak did not abandon his quest for power, however, and tortured the vrocks in punishment."
