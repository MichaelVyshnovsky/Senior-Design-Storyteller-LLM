        "History": "Pepin was a gnome who came from [[Waterdeep]] to Neverwinter to paint pictures for money. He met a lady in [[1374 DR]] and decided to paint her.",
        "Gameplay": "When the [[Kalach-Cha]] and [[Shandra Jerro]] came to Pepin Pollo, he dismissed the lady and started painting Shandra's portrait. Once done, he thought it was a masterpiece. If the Kalach-Cha became too interested in the painting, then [[Elanee]] became displeased. In any case, if the Kalach-Cha bought the painting, then Shandra would like the Kalach-Cha more."
