        "mainbody": "Pepin Pollo was a male gnome of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.\nPepin was a gnome who came from Waterdeep to Neverwinter to paint pictures for money. He met a lady in 1374 DR and decided to paint her.\nWhen the Kalach-Cha and Shandra Jerro came to Pepin Pollo, he dismissed the lady and started painting Shandras portrait. Once done, he thought it was a masterpiece. If the Kalach-Cha became too interested in the painting, then Elanee became displeased. In any case, if the Kalach-Cha bought the painting, then Shandra would like the Kalach-Cha more."
