Sulphon was a human sage inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was a quiet man who was dedicated to his studies and preferred to be left alone with his books rather than deal with people.
Sulphon specialized in lore dealing with magical beasts and aberrations. In his library, he owned an untitled book by Rhaphodel, Sage of Sages, on the ecology of basilisks. He also wrote on the rise of the Waterdhavian noble class.
Around 1372 DR, he was often doing research within the Great Library of the Font of Knowledge, a temple to Oghma in the Castle Ward.
