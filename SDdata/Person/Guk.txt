'''Guk''' was a female [[goblin]] [[rogue]] and member of the [[Hidden]] in [[Maerimydra]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Description==
She had deep red skin and yellow eyes. Guk was a notably small goblin.

==Personality==
Although rarely one to speak, Guk would occasionally squeak loudly if frightened. She was considered a receptive pupil.

==Abilities==
Like most goblins, Guk's size and instincts made her well-suited to stealth. However, under the tutelage of the Hidden, her natural talents were cultivated to the point that she was considered one of the stealthiest in the group.

==Possessions==
She wore a set of ''+1 [[studded leather]]'' that allowed her to merge with the shadows around her. In addition, Guk was equipped with a ''+1 [[venomous]] [[short sword]]'' and a well-crafted [[hand crossbow]]

==Relationships==
Although she rarely spoke, Guk had made firm allies with the other members of the [[Hidden]] and had proved an able pupil to the senior members.

==History==
===Goblin slave===
Guk had spent much of her early life as a slave in the city of Maerimydra. However, during the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], the city was sacked by the armies of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]]. Luckily, Guk managed to avoid most of the chaos by hiding in an urn.

===Among the Hidden===
After the fall of Maerimydra, Guk fell in with a group called the Hidden, who aimed to overthrow the rule of both Kurgoth Hellspawn and the opportunistic [[Kiaransalee]]an followers led by [[Irae T'sarran]]. Under their tutelage, her skills as a rogue and at remaining unseen blossomed to the point that she was considered one of the stealthiest among them. Despite not even being a drow, Guk was often selected to be a scout for the group in order to find allies for their cause.
