Azdraka was a green dragon who was slain by Lady Tanamere Alagondar and several adventurers in the late 14 century DR.
Azdraka terrorized the High Road south of Neverwinter during the late 14 century DR, prompting Lady Tanamere, a member of Neverwinters royal family, to rally two parties of adventurers to slay the dragon. While they succeeded in killing Azdraka, four of the adventurers died in the fight, along with Lady Tanameres squire and her horse, and Lady Tanamere herself succumbed to her wounds soon after. At her royal bidding, all of the fallen were laid to rest alongside Azdrakas bones in a dragon-shaped barrow near the site of the battle.
By the late 15 century DR, most common folk seemed to have forgotten both Azdrakas and Lady Tanameres names, but some still recalled the legend of their battle and the location of their shared tomb.
