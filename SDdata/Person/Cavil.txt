'''Cavil''' was an assassin member of the [[Assassins Guild of the Galenas]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In 1357 DR, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party somehow captured Cavil and Cavil gave precious information about the guild to Gareth.
However it was discovered that was all a plot of the Grandfather to lure Gareth in a trap.

==Personality==
Cavil was very loyal to the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] and considered him the greatest man in [[north Faer√ªn]]. He never betrayed him willingly. Only torture or powerful ensorcellment could break his will.
