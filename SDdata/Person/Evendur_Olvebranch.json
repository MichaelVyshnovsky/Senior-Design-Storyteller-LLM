        "mainbody": "'''Evendur Olvebranch''' was a [[halfling]] [[expert]] and sage living in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "She was an inquisitive young woman of two diametrically opposed parts: on the one hand, prim and proper and orderly, and on the other, a chaotic whirlwind of activity, talk, and thought. She was excitable in conversation, asking lots more questions than necessary, and she forgot nothing. Not many could spend more than a few minutes in her company.",
        "Activities": "Nevertheless, Evendur was a fast and knowledgeable researcher, but also quite expensive. For her services, ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], she charged 20 [[gp]] to answer a significant question, but could do so in a couple of hours.\n\nShe visited the [[Monastery of St. Ulrach]] occasionally to collect some special herbs that the monks there cultivated."
