        "mainbody": "'''Azimer''' was a crazy [[lich]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Azimer lived in Myth Drannor in the years before the [[Weeping War]] but refused to join the city's defenders.\n\nIn time, he became a lich. However, he descended into insanity and he still believed himself to be a living being, still directing his magic school. Azimer believed he was also surrounded by undefined enemies.\n\nIn 1357 DR, [[Lashan Aumersair]], after his defeat in the [[Second inter-dale war]], ventured into Myth Drannor with a few followers and ran into Azimer. Azimer believed Lashan to be one of his students. Instead, Lashan attacked him and the lich destroyed the former tyrant and his followers.",
        "Activities": "Azimer was still living in his [[School of Wizardry]] and usually kept busy following his madness. Unless provoked, he ignored adventurers.",
        "Personality": "Azimer went insane long before turning into a lich.\n\nAzimer in his madness believed that he had created a new potion formula that would give him immortality and godlike powers.",
        "Relationship": "Azimer had a [[grell]] as pet.",
