Hestroone Sturnshon was the brat among the daughters of Hlargrim Sturnshon, who along with her eight sisters worked at the Dryads Dreams, the only festhall in Mosstone, Tethyr, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Like her sisters, Hestroone had long silky brown hair, akin to the color of ivory, and large cheerful dark eyes. She wore the Dryads uniform a sewn green-dyed leather gown resembling that of an actual dryad, which was a dress made out of leaves.
Hestroone, Braetha, Charethra, Kalaeria, and her five other sisters all worked at the Dryads Dreams with their father. The women were in charge of serving food and drinks to the customers and entertained them, giving rubdowns to sore muscles of foresters and rangers at the end of a long workday. The women greeted the clients with cheery attitudes and affectionate body language. On occasion, they performed a limited assortment of medical procedures, such as setting dislocated joints or fingers for the locals.
