Jerrod was a barbarian shaman who fought against the archmage Arakon and united the Reghedmen and the Uthgardt tribes against the common foe.
Jerrod wielded an enchanted mace, in later centuries simply known as Jerrods mace.

Some time before the late 13 century DR, wizard Arakon attacked Icewind Dale with a army of mercenaries. Banding together the Reghedmen and the Uthgardt tribes fought back until the archmage opened a gate to the Nine Hells.
After seeing a vision of Tempos, Jerrod sacrificed himself by leaping into the portal to Baator, sealing the passageway and creating monument that came to be known as Jerrods stone.
