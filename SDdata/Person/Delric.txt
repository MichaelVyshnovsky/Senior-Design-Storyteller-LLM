'''Delric''' was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the [[Copper Coronet]] in the [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] of [[Athkatla]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Delric was a balding mountain of a man. His ears were decorated with earrings and he worked wearing his [[breastplate]], [[greaves]], and armored [[codpiece]]. Judging by his posturing and physique, Delric was an experienced [[fighter]]. When at the Coronet, Delric showed only cold stoic face, rarely acting over-friendly with customers..

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Delric was an established member of the Copper Coronet's staff. He, along with [[Vaermaer]], [[Bordovan]], and [[Othlo]], was supervised by Old [[Sarvo Droostan]], the Coronet's tavernmaster. Delric worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. The bouncer and the rest of the mountainous men kept large rocks behind the bar. These rocks were used as projectiles, thrown around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Delric's attitude changed to glacial when a city official or an obviously rich visitor entered the Coronet. He and his fellow bartenders did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronet's female employees.
