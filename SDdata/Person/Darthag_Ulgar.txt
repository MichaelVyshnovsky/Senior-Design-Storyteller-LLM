'''Darthag Ulgar''' was a merchant of the [[Lionshield Coster]] and the operator of their trading post in [[Nightstone]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Darthag was formerly married to [[Alaestra Ulgar]], who ran the Lionshield trading post in [[Triboar]].

==History==
When a [[cloud giant]] rained stones down on Nightstone in the late 15{{th}} century, Darthag managed to survive for some time. When [[goblin]]s raided the town shortly thereafter, he was abducted to their nearby caves and slain. He was then feasted upon by [[giant rat]]s.
