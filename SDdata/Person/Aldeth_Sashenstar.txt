'''Aldeth Sashenstar''' was a merchant and the patriarch of the noble [[Sashenstar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], as well as the head of the [[Merchant's League]] ''circa'' the late 1360s [[DR]].

==Personality==
While he was a reasonable man who was responsive to compromise he had same prejudice against those who had lifestyles that were different from his own. He saw those that chose to permanently live in the wilderness as "uncultured barbarians".

==Possessions==
He had a cabin in [[Cloak Wood]] that he used for hunting trips.

Aldeth was in possession of the unique [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[broadsword]] ''[[Kondar]]''.

==Relationships==
Aldeth was head of the Sashenstar [[patriar family]] of Baldur's Gate. The accumulated their wealth from their great fleet of ships, their mining interests and business holdings in the textiles industry. He was uncle to the great adventurer [[Dabron Sashenstar]].The ''Baldur's Gate'' game has Dabron appear as the brother of Aldeth, though the sourcebooks ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' and ''[[Power of Faerûn]]'' make it canon that he is his nephew.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Aldeth and some of his companions had gone on a hunting expedition in Cloak Wood and were harassed by the [[druid]]s of Cloak Wood led by [[archdruid]] [[Seniyad]], who accused them of trespassing within the woods and killing the animals, even of murdering a druid. They took shelter in their cabin. At this time, [[Abdel Adrian]] and his adventuring companies might have intervened; if they did, they sided with Aldeth and his hunters against the druids.<ref>In the ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' game, ''if'' the player intervenes and sides with the druids against Aldeth, then Aldeth is slain. In this case, Dabron subsequently appears in Baldur's Gate to confront the player and seek vengeance for the death of Aldeth. However, ''[[Power of Faerûn]]'' makes it clear Dabron returned in 1372 DR in time for Aldeth's death that year, negating this possible outcome of ''Baldur's Gate''.

He was unaware that his consortium's estate in Baldur's Gate had been infiltrated by [[doppelganger]]s under the direction of [[Rieltar Anchev]]. But if Abdel had aided him earlier, then he would try to recruit his group to investigate the strange behavior of his partners [[Irlentree]] and [[Zorl Miyar]].

Aldeth died in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, and was succeeded by his nephew Dabron.
