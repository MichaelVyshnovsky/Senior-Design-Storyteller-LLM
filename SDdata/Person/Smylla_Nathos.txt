Smylla Nathos was a human sorceress, psionicist, and broker of knowledge in the Braeryn in Menzoberranzan.
Smylla came to Menzoberranzan from the surface and dwelt for a time with House Faen Tlabbar as a guest (or a pet), who despite her human nature, was surprisingly favored by the matron mother, until she fell ill. Despite the priestesses efforts to cure hear, no attempts proved to be successful. The matron mother of Faen Tlabbar sent agents to kill her, but she managed to escape. She then tried offering her services to other inhabitants, but none would take in someone fallen in disagrace in the eyes of Faen Tlabbar. She ended up in the Braeryn where she kept using her sorcerous and psionic powers to make a living as a broker of knowledge, until her powers were burned away by the disease, when she started relaying on a web of informers. She lived in an overcrowded and squalid house of goblinoids and other creatures.
In 1372 DR, Pharaun Mizzrym and Ryld Argith approached Smylla for information about missing drow males and a possible uprising of undercreatures. In exchange for the information, Pharaun promised to cure Smyllas illness by changing her into a drow, but afterwards, he silently signaled Ryld, who stabbed her through the back. He explained that morphing her into a drow didnt actually cure her, he only suppressed the illness for a brief time to trick her into telling them everything she knew about the missing males of the city.
