        "History": "Mazrol was one of the many priests of Vhaeraun who joined the [[Church of Eilistraee]] after [[1375 DR]].\n\nMazrol however actually agreed with [[Valdar Jaelre]]'s idea that it was Vhaeraun who had killed [[Eilistraee]] and was playing a deception plot.\n\nIn [[1379 DR]], Mazrol, alongside Valdar and others, plotted to help [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers attack the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]]. However, he, together with [[Naxil]] and [[Jub]], was put inside the Pit by the priests of Ghaunadaur who were trying to awaken the [[avatar]] of their god. The ooze god consumed Mazrol."
