        "mainbody": "Dominique, later known as Lady Dominique Thorin, was a boisterous elf commoner from the city of Ravens Bluff, who married into nobility after accepting the hand of Lord Alexander \"Fireball\" Thorin in the late 14 century DR.\nAlmost a year after the end of the war with Myrkyssa Jelans forces in the Vast, the noble houses of Ravens Bluff were still recovering from the losses of men, money, and in many cases, heirs. As such, the population paid close attention to the happenings among the noble houses. As the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter reported in the Ches of the  issue, Dominique made a quite a splash. To many Ravenians displeasure, Dominique, an elven commoner, wed Lord Alexander \"Fireball\" Thorin, gaining the title of Lady Thorin. Sir Thorin was a Paladin of Tyr and a Knight of the Right Hand of Tyr who had other women clamoring for his heart, including Lady Lauren DeVillarss niece. Nobles looked down on Dominique as she caused some embarrassment for House Thorin with her poor manners, \"excessive behavior,\" and unsavory associations, despite Dominique attending the Finishing School of Ravens Bluff some years prior. Alaric Harland, Tumpeters reporter on the noble houses of the Bluff, shared quotes and opinions on the marriage in his column.\nIn Tarsakh of 1371 DR, Lady Dominique was among those who signed the guest book at a housewarming gala celebrating construction and opening of Briars Patch, a building that saved as a residence, boarding house, and a chapel of Chauntea, owned by the cleric named Briar Oldhill.\nDominique attended another event, reported in the Kythorn issue of the Tumpeter of the same year â€“ the Greengrass Celebration sponsored by the temple of Lliira. Reporter Clio Hesperin claimed that Lady Dominique was seen trying to woo a cleric of Tyr and accompany her into the bushes, and another report was made on the rumors that she was later seen embracing Lord Knight Lorien Darkarrow, while Alexander Thorin sipped on a tankard of goats milk, sneering with disapproval on the festivities.\nYet another event took place in Marpenoth of 1371 DR, attended by Lady Dominique. The event was the wedding of Dame Jenilynn Leyland and Sir Sarren Nightstalker. It was reported that the wedding was scheduled for an earlier date, but Jenilynn Leyland was delayed due to her mission to the Beastlands and being transformed into a Unicorn."
