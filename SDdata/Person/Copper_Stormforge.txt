Copper Stormforge was a dwarf adventurer in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Copper was once an adventuring scout and a member of the Fine Fellows, an adventuring company from Daggerford.
In 1492 DR, Copper and his fellows descended into Undermountain. There in the Dungeon Level after Kelim became lost, Halleth Garke accused Copper and his two remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so Copper and the other two beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a revenant in order to have vengeance.
Meanwhile, Copper was captured in the Arcane Chambers by the goblins led by Yek, who proceeded to tie him up and chop off his beard.
He truly hated goblins.
