'''Copper Stormforge''' was a [[dwarf]] adventurer in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Copper was once an adventuring [[scout]] and a member of the [[Fine Fellows of Daggerford|Fine Fellows]], an adventuring company from [[Daggerford]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Copper and his fellows descended into Undermountain. There in the [[Dungeon Level]] after [[Kelim]] became lost, [[Halleth Garke]] accused Copper and his two remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so Copper and the other two beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a [[revenant]] in order to have vengeance.

Meanwhile, Copper was captured in the [[Arcane Chambers]] by the [[goblin]]s led by [[Yek]], who proceeded to tie him up and chop off his beard.

==Personality==
He truly hated goblins.
