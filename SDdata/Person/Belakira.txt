'''Ambassador Belakira''' was a [[Red Wizard]] and the political representative of the nation of [[Thay]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Belakira was pale skinned woman with piercing ice blue eyes and a largely shaved head, save for a long black ponytail that reached down to the small of her back. In keeping with Red Wizard tradition her head was decorated with intricate [[tattoo]]s. These depicted a [[white dragon]], as well as the holy symbols of [[Azuth]] and [[Mystra]]. Her face was often purposely void of expression.

==Abilities==
As a Red Wizard she knew a variety of [[spell]]s. These included the following:
: ''[[chaos (spell)|chaos]]'', ''[[cloudkill]]'', ''[[death spell]]'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[flesh to stone]]'', ''[[fumble]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[power word stun]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', and ''[[web]]''.

==Possessions==
Belakira typically dressed in clothing with a red coloration, such as a formal red robe with gold hem that she would pair with a [[silver]] belt.

As a Red Wizard she owned a wide variety of [[magic item]]s. In terms of magical apparel she owned ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[cloak of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', a ''[[necklace of adaptation]]'', a ''[[robe of elemental resistance]]'', and an [[amulet]] enspelled with a ''[[contingency]]'' ''[[teleport without error]]'' that would trigger in circumstances of mortal dangers. In terms of weaponry she had a ''[[wand of frost]]'', a ''[[wand of petrification]]'', and three ''[[bead of force|beads of force]]''.

==History==
As reported by the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]] in [[Uktar]]-[[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}},{{LCRB}}, Ambassador Belakira filed an official complaint with the governing body of Ravens Bluff of an attack on the nation of Thay, perpetrated by an adventurer or a group of adventurers from the City of Ravens. The charges included a number of murdered Red Wizards of Thay. An eyewitness fingered a man that resembled Lord [[Lorien Darkarrow]] of Ravens Bluff, disguised as a Red Wizard, who was one of the accused perpetrators; however, the evidence was scant and unreliable. Ambassador Belakira gave a detailed interview about the accusation to [[Armond Arhesian]] of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter''. The accusation was handled boldly by [[Mayor Thoden]] of Ravens Bluff, who presented a list of Thayan "Lords" who committed crimes in the City of Raves, including murder, but were untouched by the law but to diplomatic immunity. On top of that, Lorien Darkarrow provided the law with an alibi. He was badly hurt by a [[black dragon]]'s acid and teeth, allegedly.

Ambassador Belakira appeared on the pages of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' once more in [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. Journalist [[Guido]] of the Trumpeter reported on the murder of [[Dart Leftwin]], one of the leaders of [[Port Disciples]], a group that was said to have had affiliations with the Red Wizards. To this, Ambassador Belakira responded with a statement that these allegations were unproven and baseless as Thayan would never work with such "rabble," calming that if they indeed were Thayans, they were just renegades.
