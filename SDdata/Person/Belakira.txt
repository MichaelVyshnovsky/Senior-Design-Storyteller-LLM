Ambassador Belakira was a Red Wizard and the political representative of the nation of Thay in the city of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
Belakira was pale skinned woman with piercing ice blue eyes and a largely shaved head, save for a long black ponytail that reached down to the small of her back. In keeping with Red Wizard tradition her head was decorated with intricate tattoos. These depicted a white dragon, as well as the holy symbols of Azuth and Mystra. Her face was often purposely void of expression.
As a Red Wizard she knew a variety of spells. These included the following
 chaos, cloudkill, death spell, Evards black tentacles, flesh to stone, fumble, hold person, lightning bolt, magic missile, Melfs acid arrow, power word stun, read magic, slow, stoneskin, wall of force, and web.
Belakira typically dressed in clothing with a red coloration, such as a formal red robe with gold hem that she would pair with a silver belt.
As a Red Wizard she owned a wide variety of magic items. In terms of magical apparel she owned bracers of defense, a cloak of protection, a ring of protection, a ring of invisibility, a necklace of adaptation, a robe of elemental resistance, and an amulet enspelled with a contingency teleport without error that would trigger in circumstances of mortal dangers. In terms of weaponry she had a wand of frost, a wand of petrification, and three beads of force.
As reported by the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet in Uktar-Nightal of the ,, Ambassador Belakira filed an official complaint with the governing body of Ravens Bluff of an attack on the nation of Thay, perpetrated by an adventurer or a group of adventurers from the City of Ravens. The charges included a number of murdered Red Wizards of Thay. An eyewitness fingered a man that resembled Lord Lorien Darkarrow of Ravens Bluff, disguised as a Red Wizard, who was one of the accused perpetrators however, the evidence was scant and unreliable. Ambassador Belakira gave a detailed interview about the accusation to Armond Arhesian of Ravens Bluff Trumpeter. The accusation was handled boldly by Mayor Thoden of Ravens Bluff, who presented a list of Thayan "Lords" who committed crimes in the City of Raves, including murder, but were untouched by the law but to diplomatic immunity. On top of that, Lorien Darkarrow provided the law with an alibi. He was badly hurt by a black dragons acid and teeth, allegedly.
Ambassador Belakira appeared on the pages of Ravens Bluff Trumpeter once more in Mirtul of the . Journalist Guido of the Trumpeter reported on the murder of Dart Leftwin, one of the leaders of Port Disciples, a group that was said to have had affiliations with the Red Wizards. To this, Ambassador Belakira responded with a statement that these allegations were unproven and baseless as Thayan would never work with such "rabble," calming that if they indeed were Thayans, they were just renegades.
