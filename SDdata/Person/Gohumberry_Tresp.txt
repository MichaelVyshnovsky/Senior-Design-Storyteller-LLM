==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of the Absolute]] infiltrated the walls of Baldur's Gate whilst allied with the [[Church of Bhaal|cult of Bhaal]]. [[Orin the Red]], the crazed [[Chosen]] of the Lord of Murder, and her [[doppelganger]]s performed ritualistic murders of Baldurians, using as a base their so-called Tribunal, deep under the Lower City. Gohumberry Tresp grew suspicious of the rising stench of death that emanated from the [[City Sewers]]' drains and hatches. Gohumberry began investigating the scandalous issue and petitioned the [[Department of Drains and Underways]] for a resolution to the problem. The Department claimed to be handling the problem and sternly warned Gohumberry away from attempting to enter the Underways on his own. Continuing his investigation regardless, Gohumberry found an informant who'd discovered information on the so-called Tribunal. This, of course, attracted the attention of the Bhaalists. Before the man was able to get his hands on the informant's intel, Orin personally tracked him down to the baths near the [[Basilisk Gate]]. Gohumberry was slaughtered and beheaded; his body and innards were used to decorate the baths in an unholy and savage manner.
