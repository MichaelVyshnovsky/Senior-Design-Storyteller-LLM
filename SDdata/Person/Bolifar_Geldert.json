        "History": "On Alturiak of {{yearlink|1365}},{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}} Bolifar Geldert requested an out-of-the-way room to compile a report for [[Vangerdahast]] about the activities of the minor [[Cordallar]] noble family of [[Cormyr]]. He was given the keys to a room by [[Sardyl Crownsilver]], and went missing hours afterwards, without any sign of activity whatsoever.",
        "Death": "After his death, once all other tools were exhausted, Vangerdahast called on [[Elminster Aumar]], who recognized the telltale traces of a [[trapper]] having been in the room to eat someone, and remembered that the magical map on the wall was actually a ''[[portal]]''. Vangerdahast realized there and then that the Master of Beasts, [[Kaulgetharr Drell]], must have helped kill the War Wizard; they were soon attacked by [[Baerune Cordallar]], who tried to ambush them from the portal.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|85-89|5}}"
