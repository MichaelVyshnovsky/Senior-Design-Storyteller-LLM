        "mainbody": "Bolifar Geldert was a War Wizard of Cormyr.\nHe was old, bony, and customarily stooped.\nHe considered himself studious, careful, and a hard worker, though he was doddering in his old age.\nAt the time of his disappearance, he carried a writing satchel.\nOn Alturiak of , Bolifar Geldert requested an out-of-the-way room to compile a report for Vangerdahast about the activities of the minor Cordallar noble family of Cormyr. He was given the keys to a room by Sardyl Crownsilver, and went missing hours afterwards, without any sign of activity whatsoever.\nAfter his death, once all other tools were exhausted, Vangerdahast called on Elminster Aumar, who recognized the telltale traces of a trapper having been in the room to eat someone, and remembered that the magical map on the wall was actually a portal. Vangerdahast realized there and then that the Master of Beasts, Kaulgetharr Drell, must have helped kill the War Wizard they were soon attacked by Baerune Cordallar, who tried to ambush them from the portal."
