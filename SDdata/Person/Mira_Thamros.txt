'''Mira Thamros''' was the forewoman of the [[Angelhead Mine]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Her uncle was [[Melkhor Goldseeker]], a wealthy merchant and owner of the mines.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Mira and her workers were taken hostage by [[Krag Foultooth]], a [[gnoll]] leader of the [[Blackdagger Bandits]], after the Blackdaggers betrayed their deal with Melkhor and hoped to find treasure in the Angelhead Mine. She was rescued after a short while by the [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], who'd been sent by the caravan guard [[Yates|Sergeant "Dusty" Yates]]. While in captivity, Mira learned valuable information about the Blackdagger Bandits, specifically that their "leader" [[Jareth Grim]] could be found at [[Blackdagger Keep]].
