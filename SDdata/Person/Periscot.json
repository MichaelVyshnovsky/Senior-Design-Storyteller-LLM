        "mainbody": "eriscot was a halfling thief and cook in the late 14 century DR who died while on an expedition in the Shining Sea.\nIn the , sometime around the month of Flamerule, a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of Chult, which they dubbed the \"Forgotten Island\". Periscot was among the members of this group, alongside her thief husband Jarkus.\nOn Marpenoth 5, two members of the group by the names of Argus and Wedonai were patrolling the island and came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a stegosaurus. Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered forest spirits, whilst Argus would tell Devlin that the creatures wounds suggested an attack from another dinosaur. Instead of letting the issue trouble his mind, Devlin decided to spent much of the day instructing Periscot in the kitchen, since their potential investor Prince Faruq of Calimport had a particular palate.\nOn Marpenoth 11, five velociraptors attacked the expeditions campsite and the team managed to slay them, but not without Argus dying and the fighter Mallus getting injured. an ancient Sunite relic the expedition had brought with them that was supposed to have made docile all of the animals on the island.\nOver the course of the next three days, the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors. On the night of the third day, Marpenoth 19, Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the ooze off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Periscots name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.\nTwo days later, Marpenoth 22,"
