        "mainbody": "Torthalindrarron, or Torthal for short, was a steel dragon who lived on the continent of Arandron on Toril.\nHis mother was Malavauvrantarandra (Malavauvra), an ailing ancient wyrm, and his father was Phaudrantanthildrar (Phaudron), a withdrawn and focused scholar. Torthal was hatched in the same clutch as his sister Rauvrahrileenatandrar (Rauvrahreene), a ruthless and greedy sort, and his brother Velsaertirden. This was Malavauvras final clutch, and the other siblings died as hatchlings or within their first year.\nThe family laired within the castle of Steelspires, which had been built for them by stone giants. It stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of Haunvaerune.\nOf their mothers final clutch, only Torthal, Velsaert, and Rauvrahreene survived. They grew to become \"dragonets\", capable of taking human form and switching forms with ease, and, encouraged by their mother, explored the neighboring human city of Haunvaerune. But Torthal found the humans repulsive, especially in crowds, and had no interest in them or their cities.\nOne day, Torthal returned to Steelspires to speak with Phaudron and discovered his mother and father slain and his sister Rauvrahreene taking over the castle and filling it with dragon-slaying traps, which nearly killed him. Gloating, she openly admitted her guilt to her dying brother. Velsaertirden, also returning and overhearing this, attacked her, but in the chaos of battle, she escaped, injured but alive, while Torthal was obliterated."
