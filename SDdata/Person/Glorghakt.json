        "mainbody": "lorghakt was a mind flayer envoy from Ryxyg in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , the illithids of Ryxyg discovered that the fire giants of Maerimydra had built devastating arcane siege engines that they were planning to use against Hillsfar and Elventree. However, the mind flayers also discovered a means to disable those engines in secret from afar.\nThus, Glorghakt asked to meet a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet in the myconid settlement of Sporedome. There, it explained that it wanted an adventuring party find and kill a rogue mind flayer warlock whod allied itself with the demon lord Grazzt and was hidden in a place full of madness-infected faerzress. In exchange, it offered to destroy the engines of the giants.\nGlorghakt was driven by disturbing knowledge of both the surface world and the future. Only his closest confidants could use its full name. Glorghakt was very direct and matter-of-fact, never hiding information but only yielding it to those it deemed worthy.\nXicvizt and Glorghakt were spawned from the same pool."
