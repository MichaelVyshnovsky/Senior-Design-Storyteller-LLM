'''Cashaan el Farid''', often referred to as just '''Cashaan''' or '''Cashaan the Red''', was the leader of the reformed [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Cashaan was crafty and used his knowledge and upbringing from [[Calimshan]] to take advantage of the desperate [[Luskar]] people.

==Activities==
As a powerful [[necromancer]], Cashaan commanded all of the [[undead]] creatures that roamed the Host Tower. As [[Archmage Arcane]], Cashaan the Red was the highest-ranking [[wizard]] of the Host Tower and was superior to the [[Overwizard]]s of the other spires: [[Zelenn]] the White, [[Jendrick]] the Blue, [[Teyva]] the Gray, and [[Druette]] the Raven.

==History==
Cashaan el Farid hailed from Calimshan in [[west Faerûn]]. After the defeat of [[Arklem Greeth]], former Archmage Arcane, Cashaan and his fellows began to rebuild the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]'s trade routes. As of [[1485 DR]], he began to recruit adventurers to help make Luskan a more peaceful town, as merchants would rarely visit the city. He did this in a cautious, secretive manner, in order to keep the revival of the Arcane Brotherhood from the ears of others. Cashaan was the Archmage Arcane by [[1489 DR]].
