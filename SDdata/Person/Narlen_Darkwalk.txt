Narlen Darkwalk was a member of the thieves guild that operated in Baldurs Gate during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He had a very unique style of speech that was fairly close to Thieves cant.
Narlen operated under the leadership of none other than Alatos "Ravenscar" Thuibuld.
In the , Narlen had planned a heist to break into a noble estate in the Upper City of Baldurs Gate along with another thief named Rededge. The pair were in need of a trustworthy lookout.
Some time later he also heard rumors about a rogue stone being transported from Waterdeep to the home of a man named Gandolandan, and had the intent of stealing it.
