'''Ramazith Flamesinger''' was a sage in [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Ramazith's area of expertise was in marine life, both botany and [[zoology]], and especially sea [[herb]]s and [[ixitxachitl]] and other intelligent marine creatures. Ramazith collaborated with fellow sages [[Alauthym]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] and [[Nenemith]] to research the habits of ixitxachitl was ongoing in the 1350s DR.<ref>{{Cite dragon/85/The ecology of the ixitxachitl|25}} Often, sea captains of large fishing fleets consulted him about where they could find the best fishing spots, for particular species and at particular times.

==History==
Ramazith hailed from [[Durpar]]. He spent many years at sea, working as a sailor and becoming something of an expert in matters of the ocean. He turned to [[magic]] to further his own studies, and eventually became a skilled [[wizard]]. Never known as a wealthy man, he apparently discovered something extremely valuable in the ocean depths, because he was suddenly able to fund the construction of the lavish [[Ramazith's tower]].

He abruptly disappeared one day. Although no one knew exactly what transpired, a popular rumor was that Ramazith had gotten romantically entangled with a [[nymph]], leading to his demise.

==Description==
Considered dashingly handsome, he had a lean and athletic body and a beard.

==Abilities==
Ramazith was an excellent swimmer and diver, better than almost any other [[human]]. In his time, he'd dived down to a number of deep sunken wrecks without any magical assistance.

He was also a great dancer.

==Home==
Ramazith's wizard tower was a famous landmark in Baldur's Gate, though some regarded it as an eyesore. The six-story brick tower was built in the architectural style of his native Durpar, to remind him of home.

Prior to his tower, Ramazith's home and office in Baldur's Gate was a rundown house near the [[Three Old Kegs]] inn, where he often went for evening meals.

==Rumors==
He was also infamous as a local ladies' man and some said Ramazith had killed some angry husbands in self-defense in his time. Others believed he was a [[Harper]] or an agent of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].

Several times, Ramazith was observed speaking with [[elf|elves]] who'd just come from [[Evermeet]], but he refused to talk about it with others.
