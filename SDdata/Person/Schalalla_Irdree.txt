Schalalla Irdree was a bard and member of the Harpers.
To confirm a story told by the bard Duthchanna of Athkatla, Schalalla and the sage Velsaert of Baldurs Gate once went on an expedition to meet the music-loving blue dragon Olothontor, the Minstrel Wyrm. They located his lair near Waterdeep and Schalalla performed for him a series of songs Velsaert described these as "songs that repeatedly moved me to tears, despite the dangerâ€”and more than once did the same, as near as I could tell, to the dragon." Thanks to that, Olothontor let them keep their lives and leave. Schalalla promised shed come back next season, alone and with a better harp and more songs, and Velsaert believed she did so. Volothamp Geddarm later spoke with Velsaert about the encounter.
