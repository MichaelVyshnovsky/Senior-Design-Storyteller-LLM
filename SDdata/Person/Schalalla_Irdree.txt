'''Schalalla Irdree''' was a [[bard]] and member of the [[Harpers]].{{Cite dragon/251/Wyrms of the North: Olothontor|71-72}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Olothontor, "The Minstrel Wyrm"}}

==History==
To confirm a story told by the [[bard]] [[Duthchanna]] of [[Athkatla]], Schalalla and the sage [[Velsaert]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] once went on an expedition to meet the music-loving [[blue dragon]] [[Olothontor]], the Minstrel Wyrm. They located his lair near [[Waterdeep]] and Schalalla performed for him a series of songs; Velsaert described these as "songs that repeatedly moved me to tears, despite the dangerâ€”and more than once did the same, as near as I could tell, to the dragon." Thanks to that, Olothontor let them keep their lives and leave. Schalalla promised she'd come back next season, alone and with a better [[harp]] and more songs, and Velsaert believed she did so. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] later spoke with Velsaert about the encounter.
