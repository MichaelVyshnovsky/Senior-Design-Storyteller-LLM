        "mainbody": "'''Rull''' was a [[Bhaalist]] [[doppelganger]] member of the [[Murder Tribunal]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "His his [[elf|elvish]] guise, Rull appeared to be a man with light skin, green eyes, and black hair. When the disguise was dropped, Rull looked like the rest of his pale kin.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Rull and several other doppelgangers accompanied a Bhaalist murderer [[Dolor]] to assassinate and mutilate the [[Figaro Pennygood]], the proprietor of the [[Facemaker's Boutique]] targeted by the church. In case unwanted eyes visited the store, Rull played the role of a [[crossbow]]-wielding hired guard. Rull was presumed killed by a group of adventurers known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]] who were investigating the series of murderers perpetrated by the Murder Tribunal."
