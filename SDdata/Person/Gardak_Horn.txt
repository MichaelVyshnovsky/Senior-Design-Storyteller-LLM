'''Gardak Horn''' was a [[shield dwarf]] [[mage]] who served as the Mage Defender of the [[Wyrm's Rock]] fortress in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} the old commander of Wyrm's Rock, [[Skorpin Crane]], had passed away in his sleep. With [[Ulder Ravengard]] in [[Elturel]] and unable to appoint a replacement, Gardak assumed responsibility, using his personal [[homunculus]] to spy upon the garrison, for which his troops hated him.
