'''Kaldani''' was a [[tiefling]] that lived in [[Elturel]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], before she was forced out of the city alongside the others of her kind.

==Relationships==
She held [[archdruid]] [[Halsin]] in high esteem, but did not care for the mercenary leader [[Aradin]] that the [[elven]] druid hired as a guide.

==History==
When the city of Elturel was [[the Descent|pulled down]] to the [[Nine Hells]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kaldani and the other tieflings were kicked out of the city. Led by [[Zevlor]], the stalwart former member of the [[Hellriders]], the group traveled west for a time, before settling at the [[Emerald Grove]] [[druid]]ic sanctuary. Like many of them, Kaldani became very worried when the grove's leader Halsin went missing, fearing for their safety in his absence.
