Kaldani was a tiefling that lived in Elturel during the late 15 century DR, before she was forced out of the city alongside the others of her kind.
She held archdruid Halsin in high esteem, but did not care for the mercenary leader Aradin that the elven druid hired as a guide.
When the city of Elturel was pulled down to the Nine Hells in the , Kaldani and the other tieflings were kicked out of the city. Led by Zevlor, the stalwart former member of the Hellriders, the group traveled west for a time, before settling at the Emerald Grove druidic sanctuary. Like many of them, Kaldani became very worried when the groves leader Halsin went missing, fearing for their safety in his absence.
