        "mainbody": "osun Armgo was a drow warrior of House Barrison DelArmgo in Menzoberranzan in the 14 century DR.\nTosun was somewhat uncomfortable with violence. That is perhaps one of the reasons he left Menzoberranzan in the first place, but his sentient sword Khazidhea often prompted him to take the more violent course of action.\nIn his youth, Tosun fought for his house against a rival house. During that battle, he was riding a riding lizard when he hit a patch of magically slicked floor. The lizard scrabbled and ended up flipping him forwards over its head. He recalled this incident shortly before his death.\nIn the , Tosun participated in Menzoberranzans failed siege of Mithral Hall. In the chaos, he managed to flee to the surface, where he met the drow Adnon Kareese, Donnia Soldou, and Kaerlic Suun Wett. He joined with them and helped them to aid and advise Obould Many-Arrows in his plan to create the Kingdom of Many-Arrows in the .\nHowever, all three of his companions were slain (one by Obould himself and two by Drizzt DoUrden) and Tosun was left by himself. Shortly thereafter, Tosun found himself wondering about his heritage and whether it had all been worthwhile. He contemplated life with the surface elves. Yet he was hunted by both Drizzt and the surface elves, who thought that he might have betrayed them to Grguch, Oboulds adversary.\nAfter being confronted and confessing his innocence, Tosun was allowed to roam free, although the elves kept a watchful eye on him. Tosun proved himself and saved a good number of heroes. After the orcs and people of the Silver Marches made peace, Tosun went on to live with the elves of the Moonwood, where he married the moon elf Sinnafain. He lived in the Moonwood with his wife and sired two children, Teirflin and Doumwielle Armgo. \nEarly in his life on the surface, Tosun was speared in the leg by an orc. The injury never fully healed and he was left with a limp for the rest of his life.\nWhen Tosuns children were older, Tosun passed on his magical, sentient sword Khazidhea, to his children by presenting it as a contest. Doumwielle defeated her brother in the contest, but in jealously he attacked her with Khazidhea. She took the sword from his grasp and killed him at the urging of the sword, then fled in horror and fear. Tosun and Sinnafein pursued Doumwielle as she fled. They were pursued by orcs until Tosun, having decided he could no longer abide life on the Surface, slashed his wifes legs and left her for dead (although she did in fact survive). He caught up with Doumwielle and together they traveled through the Underdark to QXorlarrin in order to rejoin House Barrison DelArmgo in Menzoberranzan. However, soon after their arrival, Quenthel assigned Tosun to serve as patron of the restored House DoUrden prior to her attempted conquest of the Silver Marches. In this position, he, Doumwielle, and Ravel Xorlarrin accompanied orc warlord Hartusk throughout the Silver Marches as he supervised his armies.\nIn the War of the Silver Marches (1484â€“1485 DR), Tosun rode the white dragon Aurbangras alongside Tiago Baenre on Arauthator. In 1485 DR, he was killed in battle by the weight and breath of Aurbangras. Khazidhea, some distance away, felt coldness at Tosuns death after having spent decades at his hip.\nTosun fought with two swords. He found and wielded the sword Khazidhea in 1372 DR. He later passed the sword on to his daughter, Doumwielle, but it was given back to him at the order of Quenthel Baenre when he returned to Menzoberranzan.\nHe was the son of MezBarris Armgo.\nTosun was the occasional lover of Kaerlic Suun Wett.\nTosun was married to Sinnafain for many decades. At one time, he loved her and found joy in their two children, Teirflin and Doumwielle. However, he eventually left his wife and attacked her. He publicly claimed that this was because because she could not follow the Spider Queen. Privately, he believed he had loved Sinnafain and he regretted her death, but he saw his relationships with the elves in the Moonwood as ones of survival and convenience.\nTosun appeared to care for his daughter, Doumwielle Armgo. He called her \"my little Doe\" and tried to toughen her up to be prepared for life in Menzoberranzan. However, he was also not afraid to manipulate her using Khazidhea."
