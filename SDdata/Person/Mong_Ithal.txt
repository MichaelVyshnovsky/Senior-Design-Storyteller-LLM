Mong Ithal was a chieftain of Clan Ithal during the First Age of Tethyr.
Mong Ithal was a superb military leader and a skilled fighter, but he lacked the charisma to unite the many tribes of Tethyr.
Mong was the grandfather of Chief Clovis Ithal II, who was in turn the father of Darrom Ithal, who would become the first king of a unified Tethyr.
During the Battle for Calimaronn (later named Darromar) in the , Warlord Karlag of the Tethyrian tribes was slain in combat. Mong Ithal took up the banner and continued the fight, beginning a siege against the garrison town that lasted for over a month. When the Calishite troops were finally defeated, both the town and the river upon which it sat were renamed in honor of the victorious chieftain and his clan.
