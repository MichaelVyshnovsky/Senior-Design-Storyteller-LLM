Andorra of the Many Veils, or the Gazelle, was a wildly popular dancer living in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Combined with her impressive dancing skills, Andorras beauty, genuine smile, and friendly demeanor ensured she always had a captive audience of amorous nobles.
Andorra danced at the restaurants and coffee shops of Huzuzs suqs. Her call to fame was an enchanting display involving flamboyant sheer silk veils that disappeared during her performance.
Unknown to all who watched her perform, Andorra was an elite agent of the Soft Whisper. She used her position to gather intelligence from naive young nobles and reported directly to the Grandmother of the Soft Whisper.
Andorra owned a magical jambiya, pipes of sounding, and an assortment of assassination tools.
