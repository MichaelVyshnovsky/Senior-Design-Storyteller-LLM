Haeler Thommadur was a warrior during the Elemental Evil crisis.
In 1491 DR, Haeler organized a caravan under the orders of Ascaleld Marurryn, who acted as negotiator for the Sembian Rolling Wheel. In truth, Haeler wanted to use the caravan as bait for some bandits operating in the area. With the help of some adventurers, Haeler and his men managed to clear the area.
