'''Lyrna Fathomlin''' was a [[dark elf]] [[wizard]] who lived in [[Miyeritar]]{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|58}} She was assimilated into a [[sharn]] ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-10500}}.
{{Quote|Miyeritar is lost, but through us your civilization can endure.|The sharn to Lyrna}}

==Personality==
Lyrna loved her homeland and was loyal to her esteemed family. She openly wept at the sight of the destruction wrought by the [[Dark Disaster]], and bravely set out to give her life to drive away the Killing Storms.

==Abilities==
She was a spellcaster trained in the art of [[elven high magic]]. Her personal [[ward]]s were powerful enough to protect her from the [[acid]] rain of the Killing Storms that destroyed her homeland.

==Possessions==
She wielded a [[staff]].

==History==
Lyrna was a member of House Fathomlin of [[Myth Akherynnar]] in Miyeritar when the Dark Disaster ravaged her homeland, turning it into the desolate [[High Moor]] ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-10500}}. After the failure of the [[Myriad Ritual]] to halt the Killing Storms, and the subsequent destruction of the city of [[Faer'tel'miir]], she and a procession of other dark elven high mages departed Myth Akherynnar on a suicide mission to drive the Killing Storms into [[Aryvandaar]], the land of the conquerors who had conjured the storms in the first place. They departed on a three-day journey to the [[Tosofome Caldera]] to enact their ritual.

Somehow, Lyrna became separated from her group, and found herself {{SI|90|miles|k|long=yes}} off course in the ruins of Faer'tel'miir. There, she encountered a sharn, and was subsumed by a sharn symbiote to be assimilated as a new sharn.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|55}}
