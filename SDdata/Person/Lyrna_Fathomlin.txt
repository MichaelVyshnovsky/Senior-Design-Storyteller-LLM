Lyrna Fathomlin was a dark elf wizard who lived in Miyeritar She was assimilated into a sharn circa .
Lyrna loved her homeland and was loyal to her esteemed family. She openly wept at the sight of the destruction wrought by the Dark Disaster, and bravely set out to give her life to drive away the Killing Storms.
She was a spellcaster trained in the art of elven high magic. Her personal wards were powerful enough to protect her from the acid rain of the Killing Storms that destroyed her homeland.
She wielded a staff.
Lyrna was a member of House Fathomlin of Myth Akherynnar in Miyeritar when the Dark Disaster ravaged her homeland, turning it into the desolate High Moor circa . After the failure of the Myriad Ritual to halt the Killing Storms, and the subsequent destruction of the city of Faertelmiir, she and a procession of other dark elven high mages departed Myth Akherynnar on a suicide mission to drive the Killing Storms into Aryvandaar, the land of the conquerors who had conjured the storms in the first place. They departed on a three-day journey to the Tosofome Caldera to enact their ritual.
Somehow, Lyrna became separated from her group, and found herself  off course in the ruins of Faertelmiir. There, she encountered a sharn, and was subsumed by a sharn symbiote to be assimilated as a new sharn.
