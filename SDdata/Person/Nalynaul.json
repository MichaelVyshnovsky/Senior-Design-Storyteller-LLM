        "mainbody": "alynaul the Shriveled was an alhoon who commanded a small clan of wererats in Yartar in 1372 DR.\nNalynaul was originally based in the depths of Gauntlgrym, where it commanded a druuth, a community of doppelganger servants.\nAround 1340 DR, Nalynaul transformed itself into an illithilich and left the community, leaving it to its own devices provided they continued to pass information to it. However, most of the doppelgangers were soon destroyed by the vengeful illithids of Gauntlgrym.\nNalynaul made a new base in the catacombs beneath Yartar, where it commanded a new group of servants, wererats.\nTwo doppelgangers of the druuth survived, Gondyl Ilitheeum and Semmonemily. Semmonemily, a Kraken Society agent and secret leader of the Hand of Yartar thieves guild, continued to work with Nalynaul, to their mutual advantage and a decline in rivalries between the wererats and the thieves.\nCategoryAlhoons\nCategoryMind flayers\nCategoryCrime lords\nCategoryInhabitants of Yartar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Savage Frontier\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Gauntlgrym\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\ni1rxc12spllsu1xlz26btucft7gxod6"
