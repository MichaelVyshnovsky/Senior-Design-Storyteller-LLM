Ashigi Desugaki was a provincial governor of Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Ashigi, a follower of the emperor, was nominated governor of the Fukudo Province, a territory traditionally  ruled by the family of Takenaka Okawa, in a very clever placement by retired emperor Gokammu. Ashigi Desugaki had his seat of government in Chimotoge, were he constructed Chimo Castle with imperial funds, and staffed it full of emperor-devoted soldiers. This movement greatly disturbed the shikken and in Chimotoge plots flourished. What Okawa did not know was that Ashigi also supported Takenaka Sugawara and could use his troops to help him.
Ashigi was a good administrator but a mediocre military leader.
