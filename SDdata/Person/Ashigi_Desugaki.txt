'''Ashigi Desugaki''' was a provincial governor of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Ashigi, a follower of the emperor, was nominated governor of the [[Fukudo Province]], a territory traditionally  ruled by the family of [[Takenaka Okawa]], in a very clever placement by retired emperor [[Gokammu]]. Ashigi Desugaki had his seat of government in [[Chimotoge]], were he constructed [[Chimo Castle]] with imperial funds, and staffed it full of emperor-devoted soldiers. This movement greatly disturbed the [[shikken]] and in Chimotoge plots flourished. What Okawa did not know was that Ashigi also supported [[Takenaka Sugawara]] and could use his troops to help him.

==Personality==
Ashigi was a good administrator but a mediocre military leader.
