'''Tim''' was a youth from the town of [[Eagle Peak]] in the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] of [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], Tim was still a fairly young miller's son. Once he learned how to ride a [[horse]], locals started talking about the boy's bright future as one of the [[Roadwarden Guard]], a knightly order that protected the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] in [[Cormyr]].
