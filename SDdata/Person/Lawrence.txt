'''Lawrence''' was a giant, particularly intelligent [[badger]] that formed a bond with the [[druid]] [[Lanseril Snowmantle]] and lived with him in [[Snowmantle]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When Lanseril was imprisoned by the [[Zhentarim]] in the year [[1369 DR]], Lawrence went to live with the [[half-elf]]'s uncle [[Willard Gooseford]] at the village's winery. Lawrence allowed the imprisoned druid to maintain communication with the outside world, by relaying messages between him and his elderly uncle.

He was spotted by the Priestess of Bane [[Glorganna]] who, understanding Lanseril's affinity with the natural world, ordered the [[Zhentilar]] soldiers to kill Lawrence on sight.
