'''Trill''' was the pet [[wyvern]] of [[Mattias Farseer]].

== Personality ==
Trill was well behaved for a wyvern and didn't attack humans or other creatures without provocation. 

== History ==
Mattias found Trill as a fledgling after he had killed her mother. He adopted the little wyvern and the two traveled together for many years. They found that due to Trill's nature as a wyvern, they had to continually move farther south, away from the more settled regions of northern [[Faer√ªn]].

Mattias and Trill eventually joined [[Corvus Nightfeather]]'s [[Circus of Wonders]] and were a featured act.

Trill died in [[1479 DR]] at the side of her master, fighting together against a demon in the [[Plain of Stone Spiders]].
