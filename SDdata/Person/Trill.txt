Trill was the pet wyvern of Mattias Farseer.
Trill was well behaved for a wyvern and didnt attack humans or other creatures without provocation. 
Mattias found Trill as a fledgling after he had killed her mother. He adopted the little wyvern and the two traveled together for many years. They found that due to Trills nature as a wyvern, they had to continually move farther south, away from the more settled regions of northern Faerûn.
Mattias and Trill eventually joined Corvus Nightfeathers Circus of Wonders and were a featured act.
Trill died in 1479 DR at the side of her master, fighting together against a demon in the Plain of Stone Spiders.
