Around [[1489 DR]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://community.wizards.com/comment/51033371#comment-51033371|title=Calendar Date in Realms|accessdate=2015-10-26|author=Skerrit}} Langdedrosa was one of the leaders in the assault on [[Greenest]]. During the battle, he challenged [[Markguth|Sergeant Markguth]], one of the strongest of the defenders of the town, to a duel, promising to spare the lives of Greenest's people in exchange.

A few days later, he was at the Cult's camp near the city in the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]]. During an attack on the dragon hatchery, Cyanwrath was killed with a group of his guards in the shrine to [[Tiamat]].
