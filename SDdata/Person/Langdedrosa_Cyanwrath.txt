Langdedrosa Cyanwrath was a halfâ€“blue dragon member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon.
Cyanwrath was seven feet tall with bright blue scales. He had draconic features and sharp claws.
While the half-dragon had a strong sense of honor, he could be driven to wrathful rage.
In battle, Langdedrosa wore splint mail and fought with greatsword or spear.
Cyanwrath was the right hand of Frulam Mondath.
Around 1489 DR, Langdedrosa was one of the leaders in the assault on Greenest. During the battle, he challenged Sergeant Markguth, one of the strongest of the defenders of the town, to a duel, promising to spare the lives of Greenests people in exchange.
A few days later, he was at the Cults camp near the city in the Greenfields. During an attack on the dragon hatchery, Cyanwrath was killed with a group of his guards in the shrine to Tiamat.
