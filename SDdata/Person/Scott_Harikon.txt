Scott Harikon was a commander of the guards of Arabel in 1369 DR who would escort merchant caravans north into Shadowdale to help ensure their safety. He was a weary, but friendly man whose experiences aged him beyond his actual years.
Some time in 1369 DR, he injured his arm after an ambush by kobolds. The trauma was extensive enough to have it cradled by a sling and wrapped in bandages.
Scott looked old for his age, which wasnt helped by the gray streaks in his red beard.
Commander Harikon wore plate mail and carried a +1 longsword.
