'''Laeral Rythkyn''', also known as '''Laeral of Loudwater''', was a [[Harper]] [[wizard]] of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Her carefulness and precision had been what made her one of the youngest mages of power in the area. She was also quite jealous of her magic, and cautious not to reveal too much even to her apprentices.

==Abilities==
Laeral possessed a cantrip akin to ''[[fire quill]]'', which deciphered the directions to ''[[Thalon's Throne]]''. She could cast other spells, akin to ''[[fly]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', and ''[[dispel magic]]''. She could also cast ''[[fire shield]]'', a spell that turned spells, akin to ''[[spell turning]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', a different spell that turned the target's arms into snakes, and a spell of her own devising that converted a dagger into a sword that attacked on its own. She could also cast a spell akin to ''[[sending]]''.

==Possessions==
She owned a ''[[Helm of Hiding]]'', and at least two scrolls with spells akin to ''[[teleport]]''. She also had a ''[[spell shield]]'', a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'', a scroll of ''dancing lights'' and a different manner of shield against spells amongst the things she wore, as well as a token that transformed into a great hammer. She also wore rings, and a ''[[necklace of missiles]]'' She never went far from a rod of hers, which albeit apparently nonmagical, was hollow, with a number of chambers inside, in which she kept two scrolls: one of some manner of healing, and another one of ''[[teleport]]''.

==Activities==
She was a [[harper]] mage.

==Relationships==
She owned a [[cat]], and had taken an apprentice, [[Blaskyn]].

==History==
As of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] she was one of the youngest mages of power in the North. In mid-[[Kythorn]] of {{yearlink|1357}}, she discovered the location of ''[[Thalon's Throne]]'' from a book found in catacombs beneath [[Everlund]] while helping mages clear out [[wraith]]s. She ''[[teleport]]ed'' almost straight there, after giving her apprentice instructions on how she wanted the house kept, and bequeathing unto him the ''[[Helm of Hiding]]'' temporarily.

Teleporting to a hill alongside the [[River Dessarin]] on the edge of the [[High Forest]], she found the tower holding the ''Throne'' by twilight. After bypassing a [[naga]] and receiving a warning, she entered the tower and bypassed its traps.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|246-250|16}} At its final room, she met [[Thalon]], who attacked her with spells. She defeated the lich, but before she could take the ''throne'' she was struck down by a rain of stones.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|250-253|16}}

It turned out to be the work of her apprentice, Blaskyn; finding her helpless he took most of her obvious magical items and sat on the throne, only to be subsumed by Thalon and become his new body.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|255-258|17}} Though she was badly injured, she managed to destroy the lich by detonating the ''necklace of missiles'' which Blaskyn had taken from her and donned without bothering to identify. She fainted afterwards, but woke up, healed herself, and then teleported back to Loudwater, deciding to leave the throne for later.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|258-260|17}}

After returning to Loudwater, she discovered that Thalon had somehow modified her list of apprentices, making himself the only name in the list. She resolved to destroy the throne as soon as possible.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|260-263|17}}
