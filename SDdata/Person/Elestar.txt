'''Elestar''' was a musician and street performer inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Elestar played an accordian on the street and gave verbal commands for his pet [[bear]], [[Hansel]], to dance to the music. He was a skilled [[ranger]], which certainly helped in training Hansel, but in reality Hansel was a [[werebear]] who fully understood Elestar.
