        "mainbody": "Arxhadk was the morkoth ambassador of Olleth in Sshamath in the year 1370 DR. \nArxhadk hailed from the Arcanum of Olleth, the morkoth magocracy in the Sea of Fallen Stars. He survived out of the water thanks to a golem-like construct that resembled and had the powers of a massive water elemental, which he dwelt inside. Arxhadk had a slithering tracker as a familiar and sometimes he used it as silent and unseen assassin, unknown to the drow of Sshamath."
