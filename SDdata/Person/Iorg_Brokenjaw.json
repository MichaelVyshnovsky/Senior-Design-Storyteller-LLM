He was a well-spoken individual using brief and terse sentences.\nIn 1489 DR, he was bribed to free the Gray Patriotss member Rathene Fel. In order to do this, he instigated a prison break in order to distract the other jailers and free Rathene. However, thanks to an adventuring party there to interrogate her, his plan backfired. Out of desperation, he took Ukharim Grimshackle hostage. The adventurers somehow resolved the situation."
