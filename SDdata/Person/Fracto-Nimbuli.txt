Fracto-Nimbuli was a cloud giant ally of Yrkhetep in Chondath in 1358 DR.
Fracto-Nimbuli was a greedy and vain individual.
Usually Fracto-Nimbuli was in his main room with three spotted lions as pets.
In 1358 DR, Fracto-Nimbuli agreed to help the arcanaloth Yrkhetep in exchange for gold and power. He transported a portion of Yrkheteps troops—including the Skykillers, the Dark Watch, and others—to the Five Crown inn in Arrabar using his flying castle in order to battle the combined forces of the Sisterhood of the Oaks, the Lightblades, the Sunshafts, and the Windriders.
