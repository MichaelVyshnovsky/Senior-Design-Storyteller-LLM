        "History": "Meryl had been Qilué's cook for decades and knew well all the inhabitants of the Promenade.\n\nIn [[1379 DR]], he spoke with [[Cavatina Xarann]], expressing his worries about Qilué's mental health, because the lady had acted very strangely in recent times. However, soon after, Cavatina understood that Meryl had been replaced by a [[dretch]] and raised the alarm.\n \nLater the real Meryl was found unharmed."
