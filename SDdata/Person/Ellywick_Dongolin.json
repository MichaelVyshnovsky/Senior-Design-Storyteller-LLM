        "mainbody": "Ellywick Dongolin was the gnomish innkeeper of the Cracked Crown on Podol Plaza in Phlan\nEllywick was a very sentimental person, and she was fiercely maternal.\nEllywick was phenomenally good at brewing and baking.\nBesides her vocation as an innkeep, Ellywick also spent her time tinkering.\nDuring Vorgansharaxs reign over Phlan, Ellywick was part of a covert rebellion against his reign together with fellow local business owners Durnam Goblinkicker, Grig Wyler, and Tross.\nEllywick inherited ownership of the Cracked Crown from her father.\nWhen the green dragon Vorgansharax took Phlan in the late 1480s DR, Ellywick was among the business owners who covertly rebelled against his tyranny, at least partially motivated by her inns drop in business under the dragons reign. Drawing upon her tinkering skills, she created the rolling sleds used to travel the citys hidden tunnels by the Phlanite rebellion."
