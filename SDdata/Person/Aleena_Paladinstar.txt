'''Aleena Paladinstar''' was the daughter of [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]]. 

{{quote|No one - NO ONE - tells me not to come into my father's chambers!|Aleena Paladinstar, bursting into a bed-chamber full of sleeping guards.}}

==Description==
Aleena was a tall and serious woman, often thought to be intimidating, despite being one of the most beautiful ladies of Waterdeep. The young woman inherited her chiseled facial features and stern bright eyes from her father. Aleena's mother gifted her with auburn curly hair and talent for the arcane.

==Personality==
She was stoic, independent, and highly capable, not letting anyone stand between her and her goals. She showed little interest nor patience towards chivalrous traditional ways of treating women. She spent her entire life proving that she was equal to any man and the last one who said that her true place was the kitchen was left "digesting fireballs".<ref> Aleena inherited her unwavering moral compass and sense of justice from Piergeiron.

Despite being overprotective of his daughter, Piergeiron spent years grooming Aleena to take over as the Open Lord of the City of Splendors.

==Relationships==
Aleena was the only child of Piergeiron the Paladinson and [[Maethiira]], who died in [[1344 DR]]. 

Aleena married the wizard [[Savengriff]].

Aleena once was the object of [[Eldoth Kron]]'s romantic attentions, and it was her father's fury that caused him to flee [[Waterdeep]].<ref>

==Possessions==
Aleena used a [[quarterstaff]] in combat and was quite skilled with it.

==History==
[[File:Aleena paladinstar.jpg|thumb|''Aleena Paladinstar circa 1370s [[DR]].''|300x300px]]
In the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, Aleena put on her father's armor and fooled people into thinking she was him, following an assassination attempt of the Open Lord's life. She disobeyed Prigerion's wishes and served as a distraction and a target. Despite being terrified for her father's life and expecting the assassins to strike at her, Aleena maintained the illusion, hoping to lure the assassin out into the open, aiding [[Asper]] and [[Mirt the Moneylender]] who were on the case.

Subsequently, Aleena secretly started apprenticeship with [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and became a graduate of [[Blackstaff Academy]]. She traveled to the [[Yawning Portal Inn]], in spite of her father's orders, and was preparing for the descent with the [[Force Grey]]. However she still felt insecure and feared rejection because of her womanhood. During that time, several dire plots against Waterdeep brewed in the Undermountain and Aleena crossed paths with a hero known as the [[Khelbenite]], hired by the Blackstaff to deal with the looming threats.<ref>

In [[1371 DR]],{{DDTS}} on Eleint 17 and 18, Aleena's father was to be wed to [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The wedding was interrupted by an assassination attempt on Prigerion's life and the abduction of the bride. She was taken away to a newly resettled city in the [[Utter East]]. Open Lord fell ill shortly resisting all attempts to bring him to consciousness. Khelben Arunsun assembled a rescue team of the paladins present at the wedding as guests. [[Miltiades]] helmed the operation joined by Aleena. She also advocated for the noble youth who helped to save Prigerion's life during the wedding, [[Kastonoph Nesher]] to join the group.

Blackstaff's plan was to travel through [[Undermountain]] to reach the only known portal to the Utter East in the vicinity of the city. Khelben was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of Kern's anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choice—traveling through [[Skullport]].

When Aleena's rescue team reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding [[zombies]] by the mysterious [[Skulls of Skullport]] in penance for destroying one of the floating watcher skulls. Lady Paladinstar was annoyed with the paladins' dismissal of her expertise with the Skullport's traditions that led to the confrontation with the Skulls. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Aleena fulfilled the task given to the paladins by simply opening a door for a shambling zombie.

After leaving Skullport, Noph insulted a group of ettins which provoked them to attack and ultimately caused [[Harloon]]’s death. Aleena helped the paladins to arrange a funeral pyre for Harloon using her magic. Nearing the gate, [[Able]], [[Trandon]] and Noph went ahead to scout only to discover a magical mirror in the cave's wall. It was being used by [[barlgura]]s to duplicate themselves, creating an army. The scouts were discovered, Able was killed and Noph got captured by [[vrock]]s [[Shaakat]] and [[Rejik]]. They held him, hostage, to destroy the rest of the party. Aleena had an idea to create duplicates of themselves and send them into the fray keeping the fiends distracted. The vrocks killed the magical doubles one after another, playing straight into Aleena's plan. The surviving paladins were able to penetrate the fiends’ circle of protection against the [[law]]. The vrocks fled in defeat, and Aleena sent the paladins through the gate, closing it behind them by collapsing the tunnel's ceiling with her magic.

Aleena and Blackstaff were aware of real Eidola's demise and the greater doppelganger who took her place and enthralled the Open Lord of Waterdeep to its will and life force via a ''[[soul gem]]''. To bind the creature to its harmless form of a female noble, Aleena and Khelben crafted a powerful [[enchanted]] item – ''[[girdle of righteousness]].'' They successfully tricked the creature into wearing it, but their plans were interrupted by the rushed wedding announcement and the kidnapping of the blushing featureless lizard creature bride. As Piergeiron collapsed, affected by mysterious magics, Aleena and her teacher devised a plan to retrieve Eidola and her father's soul. When the paladins disappeared through the ''portal'' to the Utter East, Aleena returned to Blackstaff, and the duo continued working on the solution to the threat.

Sometime later, Aleena reunited with the paladins as they discovered the true nature of Lady Eidola and chased her through ancient [[Netherese]] ''gates'' back to Skullport. The young wizard and her allies raided one of the warehouses of the [[Unseen]], the shadow masterminds being Eidola's attempt to enslave the ruler of Waterdeep. Eventually, the doppelganger was slain, and Aleena retrieved the magic [[diamond]]. Unfortunately, the heroes were too late, and the officials of the City of Splendors, pressured by [[Laskar Nesher]], were burying the beloved Open Lord. Waterdeep was ready to say goodbye to its beloved Open Lord, buried beside his first love, [[Shaleen]]. Serendipitously, the reunification of the ''soul gem'' and Paladinson's body brought Aleena's father back to life. To everyone's shock – his first wife was alive once again as well, as her soul was used to create the form of Eidola.

Subsequently, after [[1372 DR]], Aleena spent years away from Waterdeep [[planewalking]] and visiting distant worlds. It was rumored that she would return to replace her father, the Open Lord of Waterdeep one day after his reign ended.

Eventually, Aleena and her husband [[Savengriff]] became prolific writers. In [[1479 DR]], [[Renaer Neverember]] possessed their entire body of mundane works, which included Aleena's ''[[Of Fathers, Faiths, and Fortunes]]'' ([[1403 DR]]).
