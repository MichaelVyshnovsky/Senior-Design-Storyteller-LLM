'''Phaerl Hawksong''' was a senior priestess of [[Sehanine Moonbow]] at the [[Tower of the Moon's Magic]] in [[Evereska]] and a member of the [[Moonstars]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was the half-sister of [[Khelben Arunsun]] by the same father, [[Arun Maerdrym]].

==Personality==
She shared Khelben's dream of bringing [[elves]] and [[human]]s together. She was happy to join the Moonstars, seeing it as an opportunity to repay her debt to him.

==History==
Some time in the mid-to-late 9{{th}} century DR, Phaerl almost lost her life in [[Anauroch]] but Khelben risked his own life to save her. They found they had similar ideals about being together elves and humans.

In the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], Khelben asked her to join his Moonstars and Phaerl gladly accepted in order to repay her debt to him.

She was among the many powerful mages Arunsun brought together in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>
