Phaerl Hawksong was a senior priestess of Sehanine Moonbow at the Tower of the Moons Magic in Evereska and a member of the Moonstars in the late 14 century DR.
She was the half-sister of Khelben Arunsun by the same father, Arun Maerdrym.
She shared Khelbens dream of bringing elves and humans together. She was happy to join the Moonstars, seeing it as an opportunity to repay her debt to him.
Some time in the mid-to-late 9 century DR, Phaerl almost lost her life in Anauroch but Khelben risked his own life to save her. They found they had similar ideals about being together elves and humans.
In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, Khelben asked her to join his Moonstars and Phaerl gladly accepted in order to repay her debt to him.
She was among the many powerful mages Arunsun brought together in the , to cleanse part of the High Moor and restore Faertelmiir, a lost city of Miyeritar.
