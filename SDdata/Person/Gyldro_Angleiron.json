        "mainbody": "'''Gyldro Angleiron''' was the master smith, an aspiring writer, and the proprietor of [[Rivington General]] – a smithy shop in the [[Rivington]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Mama Angleiron didn't raise any fools.''|Gyldro Angleiron}}",
        "Description": "Gyldro was a [[human]] man with a shiny bald head and a big brown bushy beard. While working in Rivington General's workshop, Gyldro was typically plastered in dust, dirt, and sweat.",
        "Possessions": "The Rivington General smithy consisted of two interconnected buildings – the main shop, the living quarters, and Gyldro's workshop between the two.\n\nGyldro Angleiron owned a copy of ''[[Level Up Your Life]]'' – a self-help [[book]] that promised to teach its readers charisma and how to become the best versions of oneself.",
        "Relationships": "Gyldro was close with his mother – simply known as [[Mama Angleiron]]. His only employee was a [[dragonborn]] clerk. [[Exxvikyap]] was a loyal assistant who was in awe over the master smith's skills and expertise.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Master Gyldro's family included a mother and siblings. He purchased Rivington General from its previous owner, old [[Gossoon]], sometime in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1477}}. Despite Having a close relationship with Mama Angleiron, Gyldro was a lonely and sensitive soul. Sometime in his younger days, Gyldro Angleiron ventured into the [[Feywild]] and later penned an unpublished memoir about the adventure – [[Into the Feywild]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gyldro developed a case of [[melancholy]] that worried his mother, who tried to encourage the master blacksmith to find professional help. His depression likely was the result of loneliness. Gyldro attempted to find a mate by utilizing [[The Fulfilled Heart]] matchmaking service in Baldur's Gate but received no attention. Maestro [[Hartstrum]] advised Gyldro to provide a more flattering portrait that did not stress the man's vocation.\n\nIn 1492 DR, Master Angleiron started seeing weapons forged out of [[infernal iron]] appearing in the city of Baldur's Gate. Once, a [[scimitar]] made of this exotic metal was brought to the Rivington General by a [[Rivington Rats]] gang member. That was the third item of the kind. The smith swiftly sold the weapons on to get them out of his shop, believing that these diabolic items would bring nothing but trouble. He, however, wondered where the infernal iron was coming from all of a sudden. The same year, Gyldro was attacked and knocked out by one of the [[True Soul]] heroes of Baldur's Gate – the Absolute Adversaries. In reality, it was a shapeshifting [[Chosen]] of [[Bhaal]], [[Orin the Red]]. She briefly impersonated Master Gyldro Angleiron to taunt the True Soul heroes.\n\nSubsequently, Gyldro Angleiron was kidnapped and murdered by Orin the Red, leaving behind only a blood-splattered letter for the Absolute Adversaries in the smith's workshop. His body was later found in the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Temple of Bhaal]] among other victims slaughtered by the [[Murder Tribunal]]."
