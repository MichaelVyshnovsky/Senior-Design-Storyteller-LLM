        "mainbody": "Kadar al Ilmater was a Calishite human monk of Ilmater, a member of the Order of St. Uzurr, the Abbot of the Cloister of St. Uzurr, and leader of the city of Uzurr in Lapaliiya circa 1373 DR.\nSometime circa 1370 DR, Kadar learned of the cruel process by which yuan-ti transformed humans into tainted ones and broodguards. Seeing a terrible suffering, he focused on finding a means to undo the process and restore victims to full humanity. Though still unsuccessful, a spy for the yuan-ti House Eselemas operating within his Order reported that he was nearing a solution.\nIn response, yuan-ti purebloods began infiltrating Uzurr on Eleasias 1, the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, with the aim of assassinating Kadar.\nFRKadar al Ilmater\nCategoryMonks\nCategoryMonks of Ilmater\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryCalishites\nCategoryAbbots\nCategoryWorshipers of Ilmater\nCategoryMembers of the Church of Ilmater\nCategoryMembers of the Order of St. Uzurr\nCategoryInhabitants of the Cloister of St. Uzurr\nCategoryInhabitants of Uzurr\nCategoryInhabitants of Lapaliiya\nCategoryInhabitants of South Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nc2wie316yep5l2dmnp27h0t6xgaiwlj"
