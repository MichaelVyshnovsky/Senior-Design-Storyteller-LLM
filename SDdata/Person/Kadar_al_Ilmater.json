Seeing a terrible suffering, he focused on finding a means to undo the process and restore victims to full humanity. Though still unsuccessful, a spy for the yuan-ti [[House Eselemas]] operating within his Order reported that he was nearing a solution.\n\nIn response, [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s began infiltrating Uzurr on [[Eleasis 1|Eleasias 1]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], with the aim of assassinating Kadar.<ref name=tGHotR-p153>",
