Delisle was a gnome in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Hailing from Ice Peak, Delisle always lamented about the heat and the humidity of Daggerford. Many counseled her to go back to Ice Peak but Delisle didnt want anything to do with the Luskan pirate ships that harbored in her hometown.
She lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located at the intersection of Kaoth Alley and Water Street near the River Gate.
