        "mainbody": "Larghauseth, known to humans as Flashfire, was a red dragon that lived in the 14 century DR.\nLarghauseth was displayed many of the personality traits typical of adult red dragons, such as being greedy and self-centered. He was intelligent clever, with a love for games, especially of the cat-and-mouse variety. Yet he was also curious, subject to mood swings, and often made decisions arbitrarily.\nIn addition to the standard abilities of an adult red dragon, when he was alive Larghauseth was capable of casting the spells charm person, detect invisible, invisibility, lightning bolt, and sleep.\nIn his later undead form he lacked these spellcasting abilities, as well as his fear aura and dragon breath. Though he could cast the spell-like abilities affect normal fires and pyrotechnics thrice per day. And became vulnerable to holy water.\nLarghauseth was one of many dragons that flew south during the Flight of Dragons. After the destruction of Phlan he continued flying south, drawn by a strange compulsion. He eventually made his way to Mount Drakkor Rouge in the Thunder Peaks in 1358 DR.Page 16 of The Shattered Statue states that Flashfire, \"...came south several years ago in the dragon invasion that destroyed the city of Phlan on the shores of the Moonsea.\" Describing the event known as the Flight of Dragons, which occurred in 1356 DR. However, that page also states that Flashfire only moved into the Temple of the Dragon Oracle recently. For more information on this, see Note 2. Within the semi-extinct volocano he settled down in the abandoned Temple of the Dragon Oracle,\nLarghauseth came to subjugate the gargoyles that laired within the temple, making them his minions. stealing sheep from shepherds such as Clemon.\nLarghauseth came to sense that something lived within the smoke pit of his lair and it frightened him nearly senseless. He began longing to abandon his lair, wanting to escape his feelings of fear, but he couldnt manage it. He eventually came to suspect that this was due to the temple somehow exerting control over him, but had yet to figure out that the statues were the ones responsible, since their magic also caused him to unconsciously avoid the plaza in which they stood. He also was unaware that the creature he could sense was a dragonwight.\nSome time after 1358 DR, Larghauseth tried to down a dracolich potion, but was unsuccessful and died in the process. When the Cult of the Dragon came to re-establish itself in the Thunder Peaks in the 1360s DR, they found the previous cells Tome of the Dragon and experimented with some of the knowledge it revealed, transforming Larghauseths corpse into a zombie dragon. In this undead form he lacked his old intellect, operating instead on primitive instincts.\nHe was ordered by the wight known as Karnal to attack anything that wasnt him, his skeleton dragon Oskurouh, or an entity that displayed the symbol of either Velsharoon or the Cult of the Dragon. Though sometimes, unless Karnal was around to reinforce his order, Larghauseth would sometimes attack people even if they displayed those symbols."
