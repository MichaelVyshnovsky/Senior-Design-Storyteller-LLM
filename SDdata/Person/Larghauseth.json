        "mainbody": "'''Larghauseth''', known to [[human]]s as '''Flashfire''', was a [[red dragon]] that lived in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Larghauseth was displayed many of the personality traits typical of adult red dragons, such as being greedy and self-centered. He was intelligent clever, with a love for games, especially of the cat-and-mouse variety. Yet he was also curious, subject to mood swings, and often made decisions arbitrarily.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to the standard abilities of an adult red dragon, when he was alive Larghauseth was capable of casting the [[spell]]s ''[[charm person]]'', [[See invisibility|''detect invisible'']], ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and ''[[sleep]]''.\n\nIn his later [[undead]] form he lacked these spellcasting abilities, as well as his ''[[fear aura]]'' and [[dragon breath]]. Though he could cast the spell-like abilities ''[[affect normal fires]]'' and ''[[pyrotechnics]]'' thrice per day. And became vulnerable to [[holy water]].",
        "History": "Larghauseth was one of many [[dragon]]s that flew south during the [[Flight of Dragons]]. After the destruction of [[Phlan]] he continued flying south, drawn by a strange compulsion. He eventually made his way to [[Mount Drakkor Rouge]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]] in [[1358 DR]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"YearConfusion\">Page 16 of ''The Shattered Statue'' states that Flashfire, \"...came south several years ago in the dragon invasion that destroyed the city of [[Phlan]] on the shores of the [[Moonsea]].\" Describing the event known as the [[Flight of Dragons]], which occurred in [[1356 DR]]. However, that page also states that Flashfire only moved into the Temple of the Dragon Oracle recently. For more information on this, see Note 2. Within the semi-extinct volocano he settled down in the abandoned [[Temple of the Dragon Oracle]],\n\nLarghauseth came to subjugate the [[gargoyle]]s that laired within the temple, making them his minions. stealing sheep from shepherds such as [[Clemon]].\n\nLarghauseth came to sense that something lived within the smoke pit of his lair and it frightened him nearly senseless. He began longing to abandon his lair, wanting to escape his feelings of fear, but he couldn't manage it. He eventually came to suspect that this was due to the temple somehow exerting control over him, but had yet to figure out that the statues were the ones responsible, since their magic also caused him to unconsciously avoid the plaza in which they stood. He also was unaware that the creature he could sense was a [[dragonwight]].\n\nSome time after 1358 DR,{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} Larghauseth tried to down a ''[[dracolich potion]]'', but was unsuccessful and died in the process. When the Cult of the Dragon came to re-establish itself in the Thunder Peaks in the 1360's DR, they found the previous cell's ''[[Tome of the Dragon]]'' and experimented with some of the knowledge it revealed, transforming Larghauseth's corpse into a [[zombie dragon]]. In this undead form he lacked his old intellect, operating instead on primitive instincts.\n\nHe was ordered by the [[wight]] known as [[Karnal]] to attack anything that wasn't him, his [[skeleton dragon]] [[Oskurouh]], or an entity that displayed the symbol of either [[Velsharoon]] or the Cult of the Dragon. Though sometimes, unless Karnal was around to reinforce his order, Larghauseth would sometimes attack people even if they displayed those symbols."
