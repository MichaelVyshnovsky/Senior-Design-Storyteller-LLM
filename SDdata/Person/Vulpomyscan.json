        "History": "Around {{Yearlink|-3000}}, a clan of [[dwarf|dwarves]] from the [[Brightstar Lake]] region began digging into the cliffs along the edge of the [[Black Ash Plain]] when they awakened Vulpomyscan, who ate their leaders and enslaved the remaining dwarves. He put them to work excavating and mining, and over the centuries, the dwarves and their descendents began worshiping him in the Citadel of Black Ash.\n\nSometime after {{Yearlink|-2087}}, the [[human]] city of [[Unthalass]] began encroaching on Vulpomyscan's territory. He flew out and ransacked the human empire, thus angering the [[Untheric pantheon]]. They challenged Vulpomyscan, and [[Marduk]] fought him in the skies over the Black Ash Plain, eventually slaying him.",
