'''Lhabbartan''' was a mage at some point before the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, the sage [[Beldrune]], working at the [[Moonshorn Tower]], opined about a certain [[Olbert]]'s ''[[triple-delayed blast fireball]]'' spell. Beldrune noted that Olbert had created that spell by combining the work of [[Iliymbrim Sharnult]], Lhabbartan, and a third person whose name he could not recall at the moment. This strongly implied that Lhabbartan's work predated Olbert's.
