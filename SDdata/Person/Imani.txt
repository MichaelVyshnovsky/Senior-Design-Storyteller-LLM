==History==
Imani was a former adventuring wizard from [[Turmish]]. Afterward, he became a sage researching the lost [[elf|elven]] kingdom of [[Uvaeren]].

In [[1479 DR]], he discovered that the lost ''[[Diamond Staff of Chomylla]]'', key to all Uvaeren lore, was in the lair of the [[dracolich]] [[Dretchroyaster]]. He hired an adventuring party to infiltrate the lair and take it.

After Imani hired an adventuring party to went to explore Uvaeren ruins on the borders of [[Mistledale]] but a [[orc]] war band attacked his tower and stolen the Diamond Staff. So Imani instructed the adventurers to recover it.

==Personality==
Imani was always fascinated by Uvaeren artifacts, and knew that they could not be allowed to fall into evil hands.
