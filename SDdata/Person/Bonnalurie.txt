'''Bonnalurie''' was a [[sun elf]] and priestess of [[Angharradh]] in [[Tintageer]]. When her home was destroyed in a war, she was the last surviving priestess with enough power to control [[High Magic]]. On behalf of [[Durothil (prince)|Durothil]], she began to dance and sing to create a [[portal|magical gate]] through the boundaries of the realms. In doing this, she helped fifty survivors and the prince to reach [[Faer√ªn]], but she was consumed by the power of the magical forces she unleashed and was killed.
