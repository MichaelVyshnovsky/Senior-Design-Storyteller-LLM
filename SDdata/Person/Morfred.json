        "mainbody": "'''Morfred''' was the architect of [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], when he served [[Ketheric Thorm]]. However, Morfred turned against him following his conversion to [[Shar]] and purge of [[Sel没nite]]s. Morfred and his brother [[Halfred]] formed a secret [[Sel没nite]] resistance against Ketheric, which found only futility until the [[cambion]] [[Raphael]] offered him a deal: Morfred's soul for the extermination of Ketheric's [[Dark Justiciars]]. In death, he was known as the '''Infernal Mason''' and one of the many debtors that existed in Raphael's [[House of Hope]].\n{{Quote|I was an architect in life, a builder of tombs and temples, but mostly of towers.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the House of Hope was visited by a [[Absolute Adversaries|group of adventurers]] seeking the [[Orphic Hammer]]. They encountered Morfred, who gave vague answers about the nature of the House, but mentioned his previous accomplishments of being the architect behind Moonrise Towers. When told of Thorm's demise and the lifting of the shadow curse, Morfred expressed delight that eventually his actions led to Ketheric's fall, but lamented that it had come too late for his family and friends. He then urged the adventurers to escape the House while the opportunity presented itself."
