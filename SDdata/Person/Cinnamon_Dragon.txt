The '''Cinnamon Dragon''' was the name given to an unidentified [[dragon]] or other kind of creature that appeared in [[Turmish]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|17}}{{Cite polyhedron/101/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Turmish Customers and Festivals|23}}

==History==
It was first observed, or first became common knowledge, in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, when it appeared dramatically in the harbor of [[Alaghôn]], capital city of Turmish. It was thought to have been unleashed or summoned by the mage [[Orlevan Blackhammer]], for it wrapped its prehensile tail around his houseboat, carried it into the air, and obliterated it with its spells and lightning breath, with its ashes blown away on the wind. Orlevan was presumed slain in the act. Afterward, the dragon spat lightning bolts and summoned monsters at the crowds of witnesses that had gathered around the harbor—the monsters that didn't die on impact immediately attacked onlookers, quickly dispersing. The dragon itself flew away over the sea to the northeast until it disappeared from view.

Thinking it to be a new type of dragon, sages were eager to examine it or others like it to understand its nature, while alchemists wondered what benefits its body parts might have.

In the 1360s DR, the Cinnamon Dragon was spotted a number of times and by independent witnesses deep in the [[Orsraun Mountains]] west of the [[Perloush]]. It was commonly thought by sages and others that the dragon laired there, hidden from everyday view.

==Description==
A large [[wyrm]] of terrible visage, its scales were brown like [[cinnamon]], hence its appellation. It had vast [[bat]]-like wings and a long, prehensile tail.

==Powers==
It could [[Dragon breath|breathe]] forked lightning bolts and cast powerful [[spells]] known to include ''[[reverse gravity]]'' and a kind of ''[[summon monster]]'' spell that allowed it to spit living creatures.

There were different theories about its diet. Some wizards theorized the Cinnamon Dragon could change shape, and thus adopted the form of a [[horse]] in order to graze or even the form of a [[human]] so it could live among the Turmishans.
