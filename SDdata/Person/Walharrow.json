        "History": "Walharrow was a feared pirate captain. At one point, however, he was captured and jailed at Grimshackle Jail.\n\nIn [[1489 DR]], the corrupt jailer [[Iorg Brokenjaw]], in order to free [[Rathene Fel]], let Walharrow break free to use him as diversion. The minotaur pirate rampaged through the jail until an [[Adventurer|adventuring party]] there to interrogate Rathene confronted and defeated him.\n\nYears later, during the events of the [[death curse]], Walharrow was restored to life by the [[devil|infernal]] pirate [[Idrianne Smoke]] and her patrons within the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|4}}{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|39}} When Captain Smoke's forces attacked [[Port Nyanzaru]], Walharrow was sent to seize control of the [[Thundering Lizard]] inn, causing much bloodshed in the process. This prompted the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] [[Ekene-Afa]] to send adventurers to slay him once more.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|24}}"
