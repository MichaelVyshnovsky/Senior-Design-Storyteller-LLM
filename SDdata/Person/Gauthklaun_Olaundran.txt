'''Gauthklaun Olaundran''' was the patriarch of the [[Olaundran]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. At that time, his health and strength were failing and the townsfolk referred to him as "Old Gauthklaun". For the most part, his two eldest sons, [[Yolaun Olaundran|Yolaun]] and [[Bezrar Olaundran|Bezrar]], had tacitly taken over the reins of the family business, although Gauthklaun was not fully aware of it.
