Gauthklaun Olaundran was the patriarch of the Olaundran merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR. At that time, his health and strength were failing and the townsfolk referred to him as "Old Gauthklaun". For the most part, his two eldest sons, Yolaun and Bezrar, had tacitly taken over the reins of the family business, although Gauthklaun was not fully aware of it.
