() was a Zhentarim mercenary at the Yawning Portal around 1492 DR.\nYagra worked for the Zhentarim to protect Davil Starsong. In her spare time, she enjoyed wrestling with adventurers at the inn.\nIf adventurers sympathetic to Zhent objectives or who were enemies of the Xanathar approached Yagra, she could arrange a meeting for them with Davil.\nIn 1492 DR, Yagra was seen riding a carriage with Davil Starsong in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep. Later, she learned from someone with ties to the Xanathars Thieves Guild (while they were intoxicated) about a back door to the beholders lair in the sewers of Castle Ward.\nSome time later, Yagra was involved in a brawl with some of the Xanathars agents led by Krentz, but soon also became involved with some adventurers and/or Durnan. \nLater, after Davils arrest, Yagras new boss was Tashlyn Yafeera.\nYagra was bored by her work and enjoyed wrestling."
