Gryznath took the chance to try to convert his orc army to the worship of Faluzure. \n\nDuring his first attacks on [[Elturel]], Gryznath killed the [[Torm]]ite [[paladin]] Sir [[Tavil Soarvaren]], and reanimated him as an [[undead]] to take control of ''[[Loyalty's Sacrifice]]'', a holy [[artifact]] of Torm.\n\nEventually, the leaders of the [[Knights of Fury]] sent a group of [[adventurer]]s to deal with the dragon.{{Cite dungeon/221/Vainglorious|28-29}} Although the adventurers claimed to have killed him, the paladins later investigated Gryznath's lair and didn't find his corpse. Some theorized that the corpse was either retrieved by a third party for unknown purposes, or that Gryznath was resurrected as an undead by his god, Faluzure."
