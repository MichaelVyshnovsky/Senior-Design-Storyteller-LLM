'''Phelansheene''' was a [[sorceress]] under a [[curse]] in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Phelansheene was a sorceress with a [[spellbook]] full of ancient and powerful [[Netherese]] [[spell]]s. Once in Amphail she was engaged in a battle with a [[Red Wizard of Thay]]. The Red Wizard ended up trapped in a crystal ball hidden in the village and Phelansheene was cursed to manifest in [[Faer√ªn]] only on nights of a full moon and only in Amphail, because her spellbook remained there.

She was in love with [[Thorn Tlassalune]].
