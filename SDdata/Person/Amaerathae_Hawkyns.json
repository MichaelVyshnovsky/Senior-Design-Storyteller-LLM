        "mainbody": "'''Amaerathae Hawkyns''' was a member of the [[Hawkyns]] merchant family and a daughter of [[Torgrym Hawkyns]] who resided in [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Like her sisters [[Nithimra Hawkyns|Nithimra]] and [[Galonquil Hawkyns|Galonquil]], Amaerathae was a tall and good-looking woman.",
        "Personality": "Amaerathae was a pleasant and warm individual who cared little about Amnian formalities and etiquette.\n\nRaised in wealth, among art, revelry, and festivities, Amaerathae, like all members of her family, was a talented singer and dancer. She possessed high tolerance for alcohol and could remain clear-minded throughout all the many nights of Hawkyns family revelries in the clan's sprawling [[Hallowturrets House]] mansion.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Amaerathae and her two sisters were the only surviving children of plump and pleasant Torgrym Hawkyns. Her brothers and mother, Torgrym's wife, had perished many years prior."
