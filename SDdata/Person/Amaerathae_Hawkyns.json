She possessed high tolerance for alcohol and could remain clear-minded throughout all the many nights of Hawkyns family revelries in the clans sprawling Hallowturrets House mansion.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Amaerathae and her two sisters were the only surviving children of plump and pleasant Torgrym Hawkyns. Her brothers and mother, Torgryms wife, had perished many years prior."
