        "mainbody": "Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisner was a musician, a member of the Heart of Bane and part of the Bards Guild of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nBy Uktar of the , Vanduhar found his calling as a member of a band that performed in Ravens Bluff. The musicians instrument of choice was the Illmataran organ of pain. Along with the organ, Vanduhar found like-minded performers among Firmal who played illithid bagpipes, Havoc Sen Thornclaw with the ax of deafening and destruction used as an instrument, and Everett Taber and his drums of panic, all gathered under the leadership of the Kossuthan priest and the bands lead wailer named Nassar. As a group, they picked a name that would prove highly problematic. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous relic of the same name. In Uktar, the Bards Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the citys morale.\nUnsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of tanarri as the planar beings were attracted to the relics dark magic, plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter ended the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bards Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a Golden Rooster Patrol led by Sir Kirth Sonath-Pann. In the fallout of the performance, Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisner and the whole Heart of Bane band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Vanduhars group as the Bards Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a nabassu."
