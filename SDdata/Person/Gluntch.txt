Gluntch, or Gluntch the Bestower, was a benevolent flumph in the late 15 century DR.
Gluntch was a flying jelly-fish like flumph from the Underdark with a coloration of yellow and blue.
Gluntchs title â€“ the Bestower, came from its benevolent nature. It was known to grant allies offensive and defensive magical boosts, all while granting other boons to the opponents, like spells and enchanted items or artifacts.
