'''Arleon''', also known as '''Arleon the Unforgiven''', was a powerful [[ogre]] warlord living in [[Neverwinter]] in ancient times.

==History==
Arleon was a powerful warrior who in life killed many strong opponents. He was killed only by the combined efforts of ten valorous heroes and subsequently interred in [[Neverdeath Graveyard]]

In [[1479 DR]], the emissary [[Xivros]], a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] under [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], decided to raise him as an [[undead]] to guide Valindra's undead army in the conquest of the city. Xivros succeeded in his ritual and Arleon the Unforgiven became a [[wight]]. However, soon after an adventurer sent by Sergeant [[Knox]] to stop the plot arrived and fought and defeated the ogre wight.
