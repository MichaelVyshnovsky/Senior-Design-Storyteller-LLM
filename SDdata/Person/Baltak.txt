'''Baltak''' was a [[drow]] wizard from [[Sshamath]].

==Activities==
Baltak was a talented transmogrifist, always busy isculpting his body in an effort to attain the perfect form.

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] invited him to his new [[College of Ancient Arcana]] and he accepted.

They were busy experimenting with the [[kiira (disambiguation)|''kiira'']] found by [[Eldrinn Elpragh]] in order to find some ancient spellbooks.

In [[1479 DR]], together with his fellow and the Masters [[Urlryn Khalazza]], [[Seldszar Elpragh]], and [[Masoj Dhuunyl]] he helped Q'Arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of [[Eilistraee]]) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into brown-skinned [[dark elves]]. Afterward, they all relocated to [[Rhymanthiin]].
