Baltak was a drow wizard from Sshamath.
Baltak was a talented transmogrifist, always busy isculpting his body in an effort to attain the perfect form.
In 1377 DR, Qarlynd Melarn invited him to his new College of Ancient Arcana and he accepted.
They were busy experimenting with the kiira found by Eldrinn Elpragh in order to find some ancient spellbooks.
In 1479 DR, together with his fellow and the Masters Urlryn Khalazza, Seldszar Elpragh, and Masoj Dhuunyl he helped QArlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonais blood into brown-skinned dark elves. Afterward, they all relocated to Rhymanthiin.
