'''Lord Francis Tenraw''' was a nobleman in a leadership role who lived before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Lord Tenraw famously commissioned a set of [[enchanted]] [[heavy armor]], the ''[[Lord's Command]]'' in preparation for a war that was never to come. He ended up using that armor as a simple ceremonial piece until his death. The title was inherited by his daughter, who ended up selling the ''Lord's Command'' to finance building a new library for her subjects.
