Lord Francis Tenraw was a nobleman in a leadership role who lived before 1372 DR.
Lord Tenraw famously commissioned a set of enchanted heavy armor, the Lords Command in preparation for a war that was never to come. He ended up using that armor as a simple ceremonial piece until his death. The title was inherited by his daughter, who ended up selling the Lords Command to finance building a new library for her subjects.
