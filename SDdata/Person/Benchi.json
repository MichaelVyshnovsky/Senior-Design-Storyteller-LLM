        "History": "Benchi was orphaned at very young age and sold to [[No Koni Wa]], a old [[kensai]] uncle of the famous kensai master [[To Jano]]. To Jano taught Benchi the art of the sword.\nAfter the death of his master, Benchi wandered the countryside as a sellsword, becoming quite famous. Around [[1357 DR]], he grow bored of this life and bought a ship to ferry inhabitants of the ferry-keep of [[Bex Yr]] across the wide Fenghsintzu at [[Shosun]]. Poling was a good exercise and his sword saved his passengers many times from thieves and pirates. These exploits and his reputation as a honest man founded many tales about the kensai ferry-keep."
