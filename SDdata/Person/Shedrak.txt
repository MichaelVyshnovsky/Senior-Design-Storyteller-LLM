Shedrak of the Eyes was an adventurer who became the favored servant of a beholder living in the Wormwrithings in the Underdark in the late 15 century DR.
Shedrak went with an adventuring party to Wormwrithings. However, the others were captured and killed by a beholder, Karazikar. Through great luck, Shedrak survived its eye rays. Intrigued, Karazikar decided to make him its slave, and he soon became its favorite.
Circa 1486 DR, an expedition led by some adventurers, hired by Bruenor Battlehammer to investigate the threat of the demon lords, came to Wormwrithings. They were in need of the central eye of a beholder for a rite to banish the demon lords. Shedrak was confronted and possibly killed along with his master by the adventurers.
Karazikar had broken Shedraks mind in order to make him its slave. Shedrak considered the beholder a god and would not tolerate any impudence or resistance to the beholder.
