Harbesh Carver was an adventuring thug and thief, member of the Hands of Fury, active in the early 14 century DR.
Harbesh was an unpleasant individual. A shield dwarf outcast and a thug liked to stay out of any discussions or arguments that sparked between his teammates. He was a grumpy, capable, smart, and very strong individual who showed more interest and affection to a difficult lock than even the friendliest man or woman.
Harbesh wore a set of leather armor and was armed with a short sword as well as a small crossbow.
Harbesh joined his adventuring group sometime before the , when he, along with the Hands of Fury, traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of Luskan, ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of Targos, besieged by the Legion of the Chimera.
