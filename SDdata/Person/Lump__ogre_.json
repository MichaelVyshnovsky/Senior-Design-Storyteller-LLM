        "mainbody": "'''Lump the Enlightened''' was a particularly canny and articulate [[ogre]] mercenary that worked on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Am I not astonishing? A robust diet makes for a shrewd mind, you see. I am a gourmand...|Lump, in agreement about what a great specimen of ogre he is.}}",
        "Personality": "Lump was quite well-spoken for an ogre and did the speaking for his group of three. While he displayed eloquence and a discerning taste for food not often found among other ogres, Lump was just as greedy and gluttonous as they came.\n\nHe could be considered one of the [[faithless]] as he did not worship any particular deity.",
        "Possessions": "While Lump maintained his exceptional intelligence originated from his healthy appetite and varied diet, it was likely the effect of the ''[[headband of intellect]]'' he wore.\n\nHe also kept with him a ''[[Lump's war horn|war horn]]'', that allowed employers to call for he and his companions in battle.",
        "Relationships": "He worked alongside two less-intelligent ogres, [[Chock]] and [[Fank]].",
        "History": "{{Quote|The goblins understand my appetites. They sate my hunger for gold and the rest sate my hunger for meat.}}\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lump and his subordinates worked for the [[cult of the Absolute]], keeping post at the ruined town of [[Moonhaven]] on the [[Risen Road]]. In exchange for [[gp|gold]] and their choice of goblins to eat, the trio were responsible to ensuring that anyone that passed through town was marked with the brand of [[the Absolute]], lest they venture too near the cult's outpost at the [[Shattered Sanctum]].\n\nLump had no loyalty to the Absolute beyond his love of the gold and food they offered."
