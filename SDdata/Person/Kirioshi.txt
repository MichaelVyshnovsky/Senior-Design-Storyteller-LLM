'''Kirioshi''' was a ''shoya'' of a quarter of a unnamed city of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], his drunken grandson and his friends started a brawl with an adventuring party. Kirioshi arrived to pacify them with his militiamen but considered the adventurers the instigators of the brawl and demanded a very steep fine from them, and felt insulted if told his grandson was responsible. All changed, however, when they were approached by a representative of the merchant [[Ko Mei Kho]] and Kirioshi considered the matter closed.
