Kirioshi was a shoya of a quarter of a unnamed city of Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In 1357 DR, his drunken grandson and his friends started a brawl with an adventuring party. Kirioshi arrived to pacify them with his militiamen but considered the adventurers the instigators of the brawl and demanded a very steep fine from them, and felt insulted if told his grandson was responsible. All changed, however, when they were approached by a representative of the merchant Ko Mei Kho and Kirioshi considered the matter closed.
