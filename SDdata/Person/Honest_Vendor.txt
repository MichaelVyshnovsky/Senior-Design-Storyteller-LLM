==Description==
Honest Vendor was a [[tiefling]] man of the [[Asmodeus]] bloodline, betrayed by his bright crimson skin, small fiery eyes, and stubby horns. He had braided short black hair.

==Possessions==
The tiefling carried a variety of charms, [[amulet]]s, [[necklace]]s, and [[ring]]s. None of them were [[enchanted]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the tiefling known as the Honest Vendor found a way to make [[coin]] on na√Øve and scared Baldurians. The city lived in fear of the cultist infiltrators and the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The Vendor advertised his mundane, cheap jewelry as magical charms that could protect the wearers from Absolutist incantations and alleviate cultist [[curse]]s. Even if folk needed a magical remedy, the tiefling con artist tried to convince them they always needed to stock up on magical prophylactics. [[Cressida Flint]] was one of the Vendor's customers.
