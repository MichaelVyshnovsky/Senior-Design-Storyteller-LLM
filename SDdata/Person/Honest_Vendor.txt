The man only known as the Honest Vendor was a charm peddler and a confidence artist from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Honest Vendor was a tiefling man of the Asmodeus bloodline, betrayed by his bright crimson skin, small fiery eyes, and stubby horns. He had braided short black hair.
The tiefling carried a variety of charms, amulets, necklaces, and rings. None of them were enchanted.
In the , the tiefling known as the Honest Vendor found a way to make coin on na√Øve and scared Baldurians. The city lived in fear of the cultist infiltrators and the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute. The Vendor advertised his mundane, cheap jewelry as magical charms that could protect the wearers from Absolutist incantations and alleviate cultist curses. Even if folk needed a magical remedy, the tiefling con artist tried to convince them they always needed to stock up on magical prophylactics. Cressida Flint was one of the Vendors customers.
