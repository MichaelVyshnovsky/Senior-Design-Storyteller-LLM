'''Perestrom''' was a [[Zhentarim]] adventurer [[wizard]] in [[Yûlash]].

==History==
Perestrom was the master of the [[Lords of the Ebon Wyrm]], a small adventuring party loyal to the [[Zhent]]. He led them to sack many places in the [[Moonsea]] and [[Cormanthyr]].

In [[1374 DR]], however, in [[Myth Drannor]], the [[fey'ri]] slaughtered most of Perestrom's adventurers. Perestrom noticed the strange creatures and went to make a report about them to [[Scyllua Darkhope]].
