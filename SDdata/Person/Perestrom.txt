Perestrom was a Zhentarim adventurer wizard in Yûlash.
Perestrom was the master of the Lords of the Ebon Wyrm, a small adventuring party loyal to the Zhent. He led them to sack many places in the Moonsea and Cormanthyr.
In 1374 DR, however, in Myth Drannor, the feyri slaughtered most of Perestroms adventurers. Perestrom noticed the strange creatures and went to make a report about them to Scyllua Darkhope.
