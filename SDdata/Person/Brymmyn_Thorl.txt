'''Brymmyn Thorl''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|244}} to {{yearlink|246}}.

==Description==
Brymmyn was a spade-bearded giant of a man with cold eyes.

==Personality==
He planned for every time he left his stronghold, intending never to be taken by surprise.

==Possessions==
He had a lair in the [[Troll Mountains]], and several others in different places. All of them, he shrouded in a network of magical traps that polymorphed or destroyed outright any intruder.

==Activities==
He spent much of his time creating "safeholds" and building them into the operation of [[gate]]s he found, thus allowing him to reach spaces that differed from those that other users of the same [[portal]]s reached.

==History==
Brymmyn Thorl won against the previous Magister, [[Tsanbrin Aulmeroevler]], on the latter's second duel in office. Afterwards, he spent much time building safeholds into portals. At some point in {{yearlink|246}}, the challenger [[Corthas Muhleer]] infiltrated his tower and transformed himself into Brymmyn's bed, and thus was inside his wards when he came to visit for a final time while moving out the last of his magical possessions. Corthas gave him a restless, fitful sleep before he woke the Magister and challenged him to a duel. Brymmyn lost when he was shattered while transformed into a [[gargoyle]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors continued after the destruction of his tower that there was magic left unclaimed.
