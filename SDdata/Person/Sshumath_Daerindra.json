        "mainbody": "'''Sshumath Daerindra''' was a [[drow]] [[half-dragon|half-deep dragon]] that roamed the [[Deep Wastes]] in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "As a half-[[deep dragon]], Sshumath's features were distinctly [[draconic]] compared to other drow; he had clawed hands and vicious fangs.",
        "Personality": "Highly confident and unusually inquisitive, Sshumath was an oddity in the Underdark because he was generally more interested in talking to those he encountered than fighting them.",
        "Abilities": "Like other half-[[deep dragon]]s, Sshumath could expel a gout of acid that would burn his enemies. In combat he would use [[haste]] and [[invisibility]] [[spell]]s to outmaneuver his enemies and bring his fearsome attack spells and [[greatsword]] to bear.",
        "Possessions": "Sshumath carried a [[magic]] greatsword with him, which he would alternate with his spells in combat.",
        "Activities": "Very interested in learning new bits of information, Sshumath wandered the [[Deep Wastes]] where he would engage those he met with a barrage of questions, but happily repaid news that interested him in kind.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], when the drow city of [[Maerimydra]] fell, Sshumath was well-appraised of the events that unfolded there but was on the look-out for more information about the knock-on effects of its destruction.",
