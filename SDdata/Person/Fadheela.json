Fadheela volunteered her father's guestroom for [[Thormud Horn]] after [[Kiril Duskmourn]] was allowed into the elven enclave. She also helped Kiril introduce herself to the village, and got her sharing the story of her trip, despite the traveler's surliness.{{cite book/Darkvision|184-187|19}} She was taken aback when [[Prince Monolith]] appeared later during Kiril's sendoff, though she didn't get a chance to talk about it.{{cite book/Darkvision|209|22}}"
