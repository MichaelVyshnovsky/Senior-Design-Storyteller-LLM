        "Personality": "Herokimal was a devoutly religious paladin.It is not said what god Herokimal follows, but [[The Shining South (1993)|''The Shining South'' (1993)]] establishes that [[Torm]] is widely worshiped in Ulgarth, especially by the kingdom's knights, which suits Herokimal's alignment, personality, and paladin class very well. However, the wording in [[Shining South (sourcebook)|''Shining South'' (2004)]] suggests he follows a different faith to his people. [[Tyr]] is a strong possibility. However, he did not try to push his beliefs onto his subjects, insisting only that they obey his laws whilst within his barony. He considered his laws fair and just, and he had no tolerance of crime, instead dedicating a great amount of resources to fighting crime in all its forms. He was thus seen as a firm but just ruler.\n\nOn the other hand, he also felt everyone should enjoy the fruits of their own efforts as far as possible, and that no one should be exploited or restricted in taking advantage of the opportunities available. His policies kept life in Kelazzan quite pleasant and prosperous.",
        "Residence": "Herokimal had a manor in Kelazzan."
