        "Activities": "As a skilled [[Elemental mage|sea mage]], Hatim used his powers to take control of the [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]] whenever the [[Great Padishate of the Marid]] abandoned it in favor of other activities. He entered the Citadel with a host of [[water elemental]]s under his control and dreams of conquest in his mind.\n\nDuring his many occupations of the Citadel, Hatim entertained powerful [[sha'ir]]s while pretending to be the Great Padisha of the Marid. His ultimate goal was to create a brotherhood of sorts, formed of other powerful sea mages, hoping to overpower the [[noble marid]] and seize the Citadel for good. However, these plans, and Hatim himself, were swept aside like loose seaweed the second the Padishate returned from their excursions. [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]] found Hatim and his antics amusing, choosing to banish him each time he was caught."
