        "mainbody": "Hatim al-Rakal was an inhabitant of the Elemental Plane of Water in 1367 DR.\nAs a skilled sea mage, Hatim used his powers to take control of the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls whenever the Great Padishate of the Marid abandoned it in favor of other activities. He entered the Citadel with a host of water elementals under his control and dreams of conquest in his mind.\nDuring his many occupations of the Citadel, Hatim entertained powerful shairs while pretending to be the Great Padisha of the Marid. His ultimate goal was to create a brotherhood of sorts, formed of other powerful sea mages, hoping to overpower the noble marid and seize the Citadel for good. However, these plans, and Hatim himself, were swept aside like loose seaweed the second the Padishate returned from their excursions. Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari found Hatim and his antics amusing, choosing to banish him each time he was caught."
