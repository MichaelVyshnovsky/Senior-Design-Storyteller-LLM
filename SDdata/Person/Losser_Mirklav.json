        "mainbody": "osser Mirklav () was a lightfoot halfling necromancer in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.\nLosser hid inside a closed shop in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nIn 1492 DR, if the Xanathar managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, he entrusted the Stone to Grinda Garloth. She agreed to take custody of the Stone but changed her mind and decided to use it for herself, ordering her familiar to hide it.\nBy chance, Losser decided to raid the Grindoth mausoleum in the City of the Dead and found the Stone. He hired Volkarr Kibbens and Urlaster Ghann in order to enter the City of the Dead.\nHowever, Losser was easily found by some kenku agents of the Xanathar.\nLosser had two human apprentices, Retchyn and Kreela, who lived with him."
