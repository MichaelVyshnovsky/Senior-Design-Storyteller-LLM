'''Aeger''' was an infamous [[giant bear]] who terrorized the [[Sword Coast]] several centuries before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Aeger was a dire menace to hundreds of small settlements on the Sword Coast several centuries before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. The powerful creature was invulnerable to fire, cold, and acid, while its touch skin made the bear well protected from mundane weapons. Eventually, the villages grew desperate and formed a militia of 200 men and women who slew Aeger. Only less than a dozen militia folk survived. The survivors skinned Aeger and shared its hide amongst each other. One of the pieces of the giant bear's skin was made into a unique piece of hide armor later known as ''[[Aeger's Hide]]''.
