        "mainbody": "Halglond was a guard in Glymril Gard in the mid-8 century DR.\nOne of Halglonds fellow guards at his post was Curthas. They both served Klandaerlas Glymril.\nDuring the night of the destruction of Glymril Gard, Curthas and Halglond were protecting the bridge between the Masters tower and the keeps battlements. They saw a strange mist-like entity that swept through the air, tinkling with a sound like bells. The entity drew the attention of the Master, who came out with a wand to menace it. Their battle was quick, and the Master died almost on the spot Curthas and Halglond were killed by the ensuing collapse of Glymril Gard, as the Masters spells died with him."
