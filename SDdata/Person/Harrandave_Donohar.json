        "mainbody": "Harrandave Donohar (or Harandave Donohar) was a human man living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was a priest of Chauntea.\nBy 1358 DR, Harandave was the high priest of the Harvest Hall temple in Wheloon, and he still held the position in 1369 DR. Harandave died and was succeeded by his daughter, Katriana Donohar, by 1374 DR.\nHe oversaw the temple and fourteen minor cleric followers, including his daughter Katriana.Cormyr The Tearing of the Weave, page 148, describes Harandave as \"a famed paladin\", though prior sources all agree that he is a priest, and his alignment does not typically allow for paladins. This may be in error, based on a misreading of the \"P\" abbreviation, but is not impossible as Chauntea does accept paladins, such as the Field Guardians, of which Harandave could be a member. The adventure also changes the spelling from \"Harandave\" to \"Harrandave\"."
