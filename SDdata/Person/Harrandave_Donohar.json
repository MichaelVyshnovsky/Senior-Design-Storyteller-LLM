        "mainbody": "'''Harrandave Donohar''' (or '''Harandave Donohar''') was a [[human]] man living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was a priest of [[Chauntea]].\n\nBy [[1358 DR]], Harandave was the high priest of the [[Harvest Hall]] temple in Wheloon, and he still held the position in [[1369 DR]]. Harandave died and was succeeded by his daughter, [[Katriana Donohar]], by [[1374 DR]].\n\nHe oversaw the temple and fourteen minor cleric followers, including his daughter Katriana.''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'', page 148, describes Harandave as \"a famed [[paladin]]\", though prior sources all agree that he is a [[priest]], and his alignment does not typically allow for paladins. This may be in error, based on a misreading of the \"P\" abbreviation, but is not impossible as Chauntea does accept paladins, such as the [[Field Guardians]], of which Harandave could be a member. The adventure also changes the spelling from \"Harandave\" to \"Harrandave\"."
