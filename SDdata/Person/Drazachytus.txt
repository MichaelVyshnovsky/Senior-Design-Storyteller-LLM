'''Drazachytus''' was a fearsome [[red dragon]] of ill repute who laired in the [[Graypeak Mountains]] of the [[Savage Frontier]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Drazachytus' renown came with the red wyrm's death. The ambitious adventuring [[mage]] named [[Visdun Fardara]] sought to gain renown through heroics. After a series of failures, he spent most of his money to purchase a powerful ''[[wand of disintegration]]'' in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], and traveled to Drazachytus's lair in the Graypeaks. With a single use of the [[wand]], Visdun turned great Drazachytus into a pile of sand. The adventuring wizard collected Drazachytus' ashes to use it as proof of his heroic deed. Visdun Fardara was praised as a hero for an entire week until Drazachytus's ashes were stolen from Visdun's strongbox by a rival wizard who wanted to use the remnants of the great red dragon to conduct magical experiments.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ashes of Drazachytus were in possessions of planeswalker [[Mintassan]], displayed in his curio shop in [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]].
