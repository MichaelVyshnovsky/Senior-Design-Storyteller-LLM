'''Galentha''' was a [[drow]] [[merchant]] who owned a goods store, called Galentha's Goods, in the western region of the [[Menzoberranzan]] bazaar. 

==History==
Galentha may have had some valuable information and trade for some adventurers, if they entered his store. He offered to trade his [[music box]] and a pair of magical candles for the base of the [[Helm of Spiders|spider helm]] the companions received from the [[tavern]] keeper in [[Icewind Dale]].
