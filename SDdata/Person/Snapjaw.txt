Snapjaw was a lizardfolk of the Scaly Death tribe in the Mere of Dead Men during the Tyranny of the Dragons.
Snapjaw was a proud lizardfolk warrior. However, like the other members of his tribe, he was recruited to work as a labourer and hunter for the Cult of the Dragon. Under orders of Rezmir the Black, the lizardfolk were put under control of the bullywug, who previously killed the tribes leader Suncaller.
