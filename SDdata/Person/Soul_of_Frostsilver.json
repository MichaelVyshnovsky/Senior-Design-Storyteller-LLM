        "mainbody": "The '''Soul of Frostsilver''' was an [[earth elemental]] that resided deep in the [[Frostsilver Mines]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Even if it was destroyed, the Soul of Frostsilver could simply reappear at a later time elsewhere within the Mines. It could create walls of earth and stone at will, and in combat it favored punching with its fists.",
        "History": "The Soul of Frostsilver was bound by the Frostsilver [[dwarves]] to the tunnels of their Mines as a guardian at the entrance to the forges. [[Laeral Silverhand]] speculated that its binding might have a sinister implication, and was proved correct when her [[adventurer]]s discovered that another earth elemental spirit had been similarly bound against its will inside of the [[Anvil of Dumathoin]]."
