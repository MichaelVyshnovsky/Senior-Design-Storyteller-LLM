        "mainbody": "he Soul of Frostsilver was an earth elemental that resided deep in the Frostsilver Mines in the late 15 century DR.\nEven if it was destroyed, the Soul of Frostsilver could simply reappear at a later time elsewhere within the Mines. It could create walls of earth and stone at will, and in combat it favored punching with its fists.\nThe Soul of Frostsilver was bound by the Frostsilver dwarves to the tunnels of their Mines as a guardian at the entrance to the forges. Laeral Silverhand speculated that its binding might have a sinister implication, and was proved correct when her adventurers discovered that another earth elemental spirit had been similarly bound against its will inside of the Anvil of Dumathoin."
