'''Vardrella “Bloodmaiden” Blawdul''' was a pirate and a writer, active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1391}}, the Bloodmaiden had spent ten years at sea as a pirate who survived [[sea serpent]]s, shipwrecks, and [[Umberlee]]'s wrathful storms. In 1391 DR, she published an autobiography [[book]] that collected her musings and experiences. ''[[Black Blades at Sunset: Ten Years a Pirate]]'' had a notable declaration that Vardrella preferred "honest" life of a pirate in the perilous sea over lording in a big city, surrounded by bootlickers, backstabbers, and liars.
