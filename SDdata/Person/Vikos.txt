'''Vikos''' was a young [[centaur]] of [[Guard (village)|Guard]] in the [[Barony of Bloodstone]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the son of [[Shinar]], one of the village elders.

==Personality==
Vikos displayed some of his ancestors' wildness in his attitude and outlook. He was an eager student of history and a gifted writer, but was very modest about his talents.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Vikos broke one of his legs when he became trapped under a tree in [[Bloodstone Pass]]. He remained pinned there for two days, but was saved by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s party. When the party subsequently arrived in the centaur village of Guard later that winter, Vikos was there to vouch for them.
