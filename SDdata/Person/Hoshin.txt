Hoshin was a shukenja adventurer in Kozakura.
Hoshins early history was shrouded in mystery some said he was a samurai fleeing his household after a love affair with a clan rivals daughter he was a pirate and the only survivor after a shipwreck he was an impostor searching for a good hiding spot for illegal activities as a yakuza or ninja or he might be an illegitimate son of the shogun. The only clear fact was that as a young man he presented himself at the gate of the Floating Cloud Monastery, a temple following the Way of Enlightenment philosophy. He remembered nothing from before that time.
Hoshin often traveled Kozakura spreading the teachings of the Way of Enlightenment. One of his goals was to go to Shou Lung to visit the birthplace of Way of Enlightenment.
In 1357 DR, Hoshin was among the candidates considered by Ko Mei Kho for a mission in Akari.
In 1358 DR, Hoshin was traveling to Shou Lung to visit the Cliffs of Tanghai when he was possibly approached by Ko Ho San.
