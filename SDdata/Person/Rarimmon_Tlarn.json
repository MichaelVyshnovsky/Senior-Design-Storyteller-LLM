        "mainbody": "Rarimmon Tlarn, known as the Archwizard of the Castle in the Clouds, was a mage who was active several centuries before the midâ€“14 century DR.\nRarimmon fought the infamous \"spellslinger\" Durshult the Doomweaver and was victorious. Afterward, Durshult was polymorphed into the humiliating form of a wingless wonder. For some decades after, it became a fad among mages to trap their defeated foes in wonder form.In very similar stories, Menzoberranzan The City (1992), page 94, says Durshult the Mage was defeated and turned into a wonder by Haleera Shundyl, while Secrets of the Magister (2000), page 29, says Durshult the Doomweaver was turned into a wonder after being defeated by Rarimmon Tlarn. It is unclear which this should be. While it is possible these are alternative or changed versions, it is also possible Durshult was defeated by Rarimmon, then defeated by Haleera, then turned into a wonder by Haleera."
