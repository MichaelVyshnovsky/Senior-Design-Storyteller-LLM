'''Wren''' was a member of the [[Shadow Druids]] of the [[Cloakwood]], who infiltrate the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had dark brown hair and wore his facial hair in a simple goatee.

==Activities==
While spying upon the Emerald Grove, Olodan took on the form of a large, gray [[rat]].

==Possessions==
Wren wore a simple [[leather]] harness, wood-and-leather greaves, and a cloth hood over his head. He preferred to fight with a large [[greatclub]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Wren had been dispatched along with [[Pinta]] to support [[Olodan]], their superior within the Shadow Druids' hierarchy. The trio remained transformed into their rodent forms, closely following [[Kagha]], who sought to convert druids of the Emerald Grove to the cause of the Shadow Druids.
