'''Alai''' was an arcane [[spellcaster]] who dedicated himself to the dogma of the [[Iron Throne]] leader [[Sarevok]] during the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate}}

==Activities==
Unbeknownst to the Iron Throne, Alai and his companions [[Gardush]], [[Naaman]], [[Diyab]], [[Aasim (human)|Aasim]], along with their leader [[Zhalimar Cloudwulfe]], sought to advance Sarevok's agenda rather than that of the mercantile organization.

==Possessions==
Alai owned a number of [[magic]]al items, including a ''[[ring of free action]]'' and a ''[[wand of lightning]]''.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Alai was among the group agents sent by the Iron Throne to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] to advise [[Thaldorn]] in his negotiations with [[Tar (emissary)|Emissary Tar]] and the city's [[Council of Four]].

That same year, the group was defeated by [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions.
