'''Sithe''' was a half-[[genasi]], half-[[demon]] [[fighter|warrior]] who worked as an enforcer for the [[Dead Rats]] gang in [[Luskan]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1410}} Although she was half-demon, she very much disliked being referred to as a demon.

==Description==
Sithe had black skin and black eyes. Rather than hair, she had tendrils of darkness leaking from her scalp.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3251}} She usually dressed in black silks.

==Abilities==
Sithe could open a portal to the void whenever she liked. She was an expert swordswoman and was even capable of defeating Kalen whom she often sparred with.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1938}}

==Possessions==
Sithe carried a large black [[axe]] and was very proficient in its use.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1265}}

==History==
Sithe was the product of an involuntary coupling between her [[windsoul genasi]] mother and a demon.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5563}} In [[1480 DR]], Sithe was ordered by [[Toytere]], the leader of the Dead Rats, to capture [[Myrin Darkdance]] so the Rats could deliver her to the [[Coin Spinners]] gang. Sithe attacked a [[dwarf|dwarven]] caravan by herself, killing many dwarves and capturing Myrin.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|364}}

While at the Dead Rats headquarters, Myrin was made to think she was actually chosen as queen of the Rats in order to keep the powerful [[wizard]] under control. [[Kalen Dren]] traveled to Luskan to rescue Myrin but found she didn't want to be rescued and stayed with Myrin at the [[Drowned Rat]]. During this time, Myrin and Kalen began investigating the cause of the [[Fury]] plague and Sithe ventured out with the pair on several forays.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|4971}}

Sithe worked with Kalen to subdue the gangs of Luskan over a ten-day span and was at the king-making gathering of the gangs Kalen called. Later, Sithe traveled with Kalen and Myrin to the Luskan underground and confronted the demon [[Scour]] who was the source of the Fury. Sithe sacrificed herself by using her innate abilities to open a portal to the void where she took the remaining fragments of Scour.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6237}} She did not return and was presumed dead by her companions.
