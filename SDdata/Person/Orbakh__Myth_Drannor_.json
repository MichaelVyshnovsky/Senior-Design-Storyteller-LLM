        "mainbody": "Orbakh was a great necromancer of Myth Drannor who resided with his brethren in the Tower of Bones in the citys Polyandrium before the Weeping War.\nOrbakh possessed many precious spellbooks and personal valuables that all were entombed with him inside his crypt. Among more mundane items were a gold skeletal mask, eighth silver rings all decorated with skull signets, and an intricate necklace of white gold, his failed and empty phylactery (a crystal encased inside a steel, platinum, and gold cage).\nAmong more notable enchanted items that Orbakh owned and was buried with were Orbakhs ivory scepter and Orbakhs bone mantle.\nOrbakh lived and died in the years that predated the advent of the Weeping War that destroyed the City of Song. He was one of the most powerful and ambitious necromancers of the Tower of Bones. Reaching older age, Orbakh was looking for a way to prolong his existence via magic and, eventually attempted the ritual of turning himself into a lich. The ritual failed, killing the wizard in the process. The fellow necromancers constructed a crypt in the Polyandrium that fit the dead wizards status, and interred his body along with his empty failed phylactery.\nAt the time of Orbakhs interment, the wizards of the Tower of Bones decided to use the crypt as a prison and death sentence for a recently disgraced member Famras. The disgraced wizard was thrown into the crypt and sealed inside. This eventually turned the crypt into a lair of a deepspawn that Famras smuggled in along with himself."
