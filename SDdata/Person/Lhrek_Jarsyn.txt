'''Lhrek Jarsyn''' was a mercenary and the leader of the [[Sailors of the Crimson Sea]] mercenary company based out of [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]] in [[Chessenta]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].''[[Swords of the Iron Legion]]'' page 28 refers to "the leader of the hunting party, Lherk Jareth". This is assumed to be in error and that it should be Lhrek Jarsyn.
 
==History==
In the 1350s DR, Lhrek and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea marched to the town of [[Timindar]] in Chondath, having been hired by Lord [[Reland Tymin]] to confront the dark forces of [[Yrkhetep]] at [[Thurgabanteth]]. However, while passing the edge of the [[Chondalwood]], they were ambushed by unknown enemies. Although the Sailors prevailed and killed all the ambushers, they were left with many wounded and dead, including their commander, [[Bendix]]. Lhrek became their acting commander.

After sending a messenger to Timindar, Lhrek, the mage [[Iurnan Chall]], and other veteran members of the company went into the Chondalwood in search of more food. However, after killing a [[deer]], cutting some branches, and starting a fire, they were captured by the [[druid]] [[Variath]] and his [[treant]]s, who put them on trial. The treants demanded justice, accepting an apology and a compensation of 1000 [[gp]]. However, Lhrek refused, so Variath threatened execution. Adventurers sent from Timindar may have aided their trial; they were not executed and went on to Timindar.

Soon after, the Sailors fought in the Battle of Thurgabanteth.

After a brief political power struggle between Lhrek and Iurnan, by [[1357 DR]] Lhrek had emerged as leader of the Sailors but he took Chall as his chief advisor and assistant.

They were active again in the early 1360s DR.

==Personality==
Lhrek was normally an amiable young man, but the ambush, capture, and trial at the Chondalwood left him angry and frustrated, wondering if the local people were ungrateful for the Sailors coming to save them.

==Possessions==
Lhrek fought with ''[[longsword]] +3'' and wore [[chain mail]].
