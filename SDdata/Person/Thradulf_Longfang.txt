'''Thradulf Longfang''' was a chieftain of the [[Red Tiger tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s living in the [[Cold Wood]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He led the tribe with a heartless demeanor and his wrath struck fear into his own people.

Although he had the authority as chieftain of the Red Tigers, he was in reality a puppet of the tribe's [[shaman]]s.

==Personality==
He was known among his own tribe as a particularly cruel individual.

==History==
Thradulf was born the nephew to [[Adalwulf Longfang]], a wise and long-ruling leader of the Cold Wood barbarians. His cousin [[Shinoras]], Adalwulf's son, was in line to succeed his father as ruler but was killed while out on a hunting expedition. Thradulf, who had become a strong voice among the tribesmen, became Adalwulf's heir and ascended as chieftain in [[1368 DR]].
