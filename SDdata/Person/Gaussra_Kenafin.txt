'''Gaussra Kenafin''' was a member of [[House Kenafin]] and a novice priestess of [[Arach-Tinilith]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Gaussra had black teeth.

==History==
In 1372 DR, Gaussra was a novice priestess at Arach-Tinilith. She joined [[Drisinil Drisinil Barrison Del'Armgo]]'s group of conspirators to overthrow Mistress [[Quenthel Baenre]], seeking power and believing that demons attempting to assassinate her were signs of [[Lolth]]'s disfavor with Quenthel. Quenthel discovered the plot and pretended to poison Drisinil in order to have her bring her fellow conspirators to an unused classroom in Arach-Tinilith, where she summoned hordes of spiders that slew them, including Gaussra.
