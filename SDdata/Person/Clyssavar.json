Legends say that he, the bronze dragon Astalagan, and the brass dragon Turadaer joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.\nIt is unknown how exactly Clyssavar died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s DR and it was \"a violent death\". His bones could be found scattered across the rocky shoal on the north side of Stormwreck Isle. Through the centuries, this site caused many shipwrecks including the wreck of the Compass Rose\nAs of the , a blue dragon wyrmling named Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the islands fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his kobold followers Mek and Minn to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Clyssavar among them. When a group of adventurers attempted to stop the wyrmlings ritual, the effigy of Clyssavar provided the power of the long dead dragon, unleashing Clyssavars Flames in glowing golden colors upon Sparkrender."
