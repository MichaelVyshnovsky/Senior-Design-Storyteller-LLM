        "mainbody": "Circe was a human wizardess turned proxy of the Olympian power known as Hecate.Circe appears in both 2nd and 1st edition, Planescape and core Dungeons & Dragons sources respectively. It seems likely that these sources refer to the same being due to the following reasons\n* In the 1st edition Deities & Demigods she is listed as a mortal, talks about the Odyssey, and describes her as being \"almost immortal.\"\n* On Hallowed Ground states Circe is a mortal servant who rose to the status of proxy. This Circe shows up again in Planes of Conflict, providing a quote about turning people into pigs, a deliberate reference to the Odyssey.\nShe was not known to have interacted with Toril, though in northwest Faer√ªn an Oghmanyte temple known as Bard Keep contained a copy of Circes Cookbook, a tome authored by a \"black sorceress.\"Due to the lack of information provided on Circes Cookbook, one could take the approach that the \"Circe\" who authored it was either an unknown sorceress in the Realms or the Circe of Greek myth. This wiki leans towards the latter, since Circe is detailed in Deities & Demigods as having the title \"black sorceress\" and because the adventure features a book on the Greek deity Hephaestus. That being said though, its important to keep in mind that this is still a speculation and that both views are valid.\nCirce was an accomplished spellcaster, allegedly having enough power to take out a small army without breaking a sweat. More specifically she was a transmuter, as the majority of her spells revolved around the polymorph effect. She also had great prophetic powers. \nAfter rising to the status of a proxy, Hecate gifted her the innate ability of having unfailing spells, allowing them to crack through most magic resistances.\nCirce typically dressed in revealing black gowns. She possessed a wide variety of magical items that all involved the polymorph effect, including potions, scrolls, and wands. One such wand of hers worked only on men, was usable only by wizards, and would turn its target into an animal that exemplified their essential nature.\nFor much of her life Circe was a devout, mortal servant of the goddess Hecate. At one point during this period of her life, she was living on an alternate prime material world and intercepted the crew of an adventurer by the name of Odysseus, the grandson of the Olympian power Hermes and the proxy of the Olympian power Athena. Circe fell in love with him and turned his crew into pigs, but ultimately Odysseus came to defeat her.\nLater in life, after many years of faithful service both she and Hecate agreed that it was time for her recieve a rise in power. Thus, she was promoted to the status of a full proxy.\nCirce spent most of her time doing her best to protect Aeaea, Hecates divine realm in the Pluton layer of Hades, and impressing her goddesss might upon those traveling through the realm.\nIn the crystal sphere known as Greatspace, Circe was among the evil members of the Olympian pantheon that were thought by the spheres inhabitants to not exist and just be mere rumors started centuries ago."
