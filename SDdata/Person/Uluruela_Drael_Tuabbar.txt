Uluruela Drael Tuabbar was a businesswoman in Menzoberranzan and an agent of the Sept of IllGhact in 1479 DR. 
Uluruela was mentally controlled by the illithids in order to guarantee that she never told anyone her true allegiance.
Uluruela studied at Arach-Tinilith but graduated low in her class, so she trained also as a warrior. She owned a business in Duthcloim, where Uluruela sold travel goods. Most of her supplies were from the Sept.
