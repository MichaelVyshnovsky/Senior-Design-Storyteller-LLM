'''Uluruela Drael Tuabbar''' was a businesswoman in [[Menzoberranzan]] and an agent of the [[Sept of Ill'Ghact]] in [[1479 DR]]. 

==Personality==
Uluruela was mentally controlled by the [[illithid]]s in order to guarantee that she never told anyone her true allegiance.

==History==
Uluruela studied at [[Arach-Tinilith]] but graduated low in her class, so she trained also as a warrior. She owned a business in [[Duthcloim]], where Uluruela sold travel goods. Most of her supplies were from the Sept.
