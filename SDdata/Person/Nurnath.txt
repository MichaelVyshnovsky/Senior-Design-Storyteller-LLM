'''Nurnath''' was a farmer in [[Red Larch]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He raised chickens in barns he owned just north of the town on the [[Long Road]]. His large barn with a green tile roof was a landmark on the road. Turning east at the barn onto a well-used cart track took a traveler between [[Mragan Gulther]]'s orchards and the grazing pasture of [[Indurr Stalnstern]] for about a mile before it climbed the hill where [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]] was located.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|84}}
