        "mainbody": "King '''Kymer''' of [[House Tethyr]], known as \"'''the Shade King'''\", was the eleventh king of the [[Lions' Dynasty]] of [[Tethyr]].",

        "Relationships": "Kymer was the illegitimate son of King [[Alemander II]] by an [[Elf|elven]] mistress. He had a younger half-brother, Prince [[Coram IV|Coram]].",
        "History": "Kymer was born in the [[1167 DR|Year of the Parchment Heretical, 1167 DR]].\n\nWhen Coram became King [[Coram IV]] in [[1202 DR]], Kymer pretended to adore him. In reality, he wanted to take over the throne. In [[1218 DR]], he finally worked his treachery by bribing the captain of the king's guard to assassinate the entire royal family in their beds. Only Prince [[Haedrak II]], who was in [[Zakhara]] at the time, survived the murder. Kymer then set himself up as king.\n\nWhen Prince Haedrak learned what had happened years later, he resorted to piracy to weaken his half-uncle's navy while buying his time and building strength. After five years, in [[1227 DR]], he finally led a flotilla against [[Zazesspur]] and the palace. The battle ended in a dual between the Shade King and the \"Corsair Prince\", Kymer wielding the ''Lion's Sword'' and Haedrak fighting with the ''[[Sword of Starlight]]''. Haedrak was victorious and slew the usurper king, taking the throne in Kymer's place."
