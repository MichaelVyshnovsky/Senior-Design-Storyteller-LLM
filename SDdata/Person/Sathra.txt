[[Sathra]] was the master of the crime syndicate of [[Laothkund]] known as the [[Shadow Tongue]]{{cite book/Stardeep|20|3}} and a necromancer until {{yearlink|1375}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|118-120|10}}

==Description==
Sathra wore an abundance of black iron jewelry, and she was rather portly in build. An aura of animated, suffering shadows surrounded her.{{cite book/Stardeep|26-28|3}}

==Personality==
Sathra was unexpectedly tenacious for a crime lord, craving ''Angul'' so badly as to chase its wielder into the [[Yuirwood]].{{cite book/Stardeep|113|10}}

==Abilities==
In combat, Sathra could call upon the shadows that writhed around her to bring them to bear against many enemies. She was also capable of summoning demons.{{cite book/Stardeep|47-52|5}} She also had the power to bring people from the grave as undead.{{cite book/Stardeep|115-116|10}} When in combat with Kiril Duskmourn, she employed a number of spells,{{cite book/Stardeep|114|10}} including one that seemed to temporarily overwhelm ''[[Angul]]'''s healing powers, possibly ''[[graymantle]]''.

==Possessions==
Sathra's office doubled as the Shadow Tongue's treasury. As of {{yearlink|1375}}, she had recently purchased a torture device known as a "Sembian Cradle".

==Activities==
As the head of the [[Shadow Tongue]], Sathra was involved in a number of crimes, and in plans to corrupt the ruling council of the city.

==Relationships==
Sathra's personal guard was known as the [[Shadow Cadre]].{{cite book/Stardeep|24-25|3}} She knew the demon [[Demoriel]] by name.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1375}}, the thief [[Gage]] broke into the Shadow Tongue lair looking for the enchanted elven sword ''[[Angul]]'', which the Shadow Tongue had stolen.Gage says Sathra was after Angul.{{cite book/Stardeep|60-61|6}} He found a way into the vault through sheer luck, after Sathra left the door open while leaving. She had been injured by trying to touch the blade herself. She caught the thief not long after, but wielding the blade, he managed to slay many of her bodyguards and even a summoned demon before she retreted.

She pursued Gage and the sword's wielder, [[Kiril Duskmourn]], into the [[Yuirwood]] later. The star elf slew her in combat at that time.

==Rumors & Legends==
Sathra was rumoured to have a Red Room in the Shadow Tongue lair where she performed unknown tortures on her victims.

The thief Gage had told some lies to Kiril about Sathra having been hired by a certain [[Nangulis]],{{cite book/Stardeep|73|6}}{{cite book/Stardeep|111|10}} per [[Telarian]]'s indications, to manipulate her into heading for [[Stardeep]].{{cite book/Stardeep|176|16}} Kiril slew Sathra without first asking about such things.
