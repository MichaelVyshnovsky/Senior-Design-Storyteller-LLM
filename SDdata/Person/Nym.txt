Nym was the aged drow proprietor of the Jewel Box tavern in Menzoberranzan in the late 14 century DR.
He was a retired battle wizard and at some point in his past lost one of his legs and didnt get it magically replaced. It was suspected that he paid a large amount of his profits to the Ruling Council of the city in order for the more blasphemous of the seedier elements of his business to be allowed to passâ€”keeping female drow slaves for prostitution.
