She was wise enough to see the value of manipulation, however.\nFavria born as a slave of a duergar clan that followed Asmodeus. She escaped when she reached adulthood, but remained fascinated by the devil god.\nShe went to Neverwinter as part of a search for Gauntlgrym. Here Favria joined the Ashmadai but continued her search for the lost dwarven city, that she intended to conquer in the name of her infernal master. She loyally followed Valindra Shadowmantle because of her assumed possession of the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus.\nFavria usually resided in the ruined village of Thundertree, knowing she was too well known in Neverwinter."
