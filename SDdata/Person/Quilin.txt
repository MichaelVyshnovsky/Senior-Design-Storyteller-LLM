'''Quilin''' was a renowned [[elf|elven]] smith and the creator of infamous [[enchanted]] blade known as the ''[[Veiled Tears]]''.

==History==
Sometime before [[1372 DR]], Quilin forged the infamous ''Veiled Tears'' [[greatsword]]. Later, the elf took on an apprentice who attempted to create a similar weapon, a lesser cousin of ''Veiled Tears'', the ''[[Gentle Rain]]''. The blade was created for mistress [[Lissial]].
