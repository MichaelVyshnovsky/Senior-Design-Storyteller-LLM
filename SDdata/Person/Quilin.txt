Quilin was a renowned elven smith and the creator of infamous enchanted blade known as the Veiled Tears.
Sometime before 1372 DR, Quilin forged the infamous Veiled Tears greatsword. Later, the elf took on an apprentice who attempted to create a similar weapon, a lesser cousin of Veiled Tears, the Gentle Rain. The blade was created for mistress Lissial.
