        "History": "Caleb was one of the local Docks' thugs, who was acting under [[Moire]]'s employ. He did not respect the Watch, at all.",
        "Gameplay": "If the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the compaions sided with the Watch, after helping [[Hagen]] defeat the thieves they would have to visit Caleb. Caleb refused to be arrested, so he and his thugs attacked them.\n\nIf the Kalach-Cha and the companions sided with the thieves, Caleb would ask them to threaten Hagen. After returning to Caleb, Hagen would come back with the guards and attack. Once they were defeated, Caleb would advise the Kalach-Cha to speak with Moire."
