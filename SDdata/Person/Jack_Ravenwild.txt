Jack Ravenwild was an adventurer and thief of the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 14 century DR. He was most noted for recovering the shadow magic spellbook known as the Sarkonagael from Sarbreen, his defeat of Myrkyssa Jelan, and for his one-hundred year imprisonment in the mythal below Ravens Bluff.
Jack was a small man, with a wiry build and a round, friendly face that was perpetually split by a jesters mocking smile. Dark eyes glittered gleefully over an impish nose, a wide mouth, and a thin trace of beard along his jawline.
Jack was a mediocre swordsman and was a wielder of wildfire magic, a rare and erratic phenomenon, but enough that he had a reputation as a sorcerer.
His acquaintances included Anders Aricssen, Tharzon Brewhammer, Ontrodes the Sage, Zandria, and Illyth Fleetwood. 
Jack and Seila Norwood were romantically attracted and Seilas father Marden Norwood seemed to have a grudging respect for Jack.
In the , Jack broke into House Kuldath and retrieved the Sarkonagael for the mysterious Elana, and followed a Red Wizard of Thay to a previously undiscovered Guilders vault in Sarbreen.
Later, Jack foiled a plot by Myrkyssa Jelan to use the ancient drow mythal in the Underdark under Ravens Bluff to end the anti-magic curse that afflicted her. Unfortunately for Jack, the House of High Magic, a local mage guild, divined that Jacks wild magic would bring some sort of magical calamity (possibly the Spellplague) to Ravens Bluff so they imprisoned Jack in magical stasis inside the mythal stone.
In the , a clan of drow were attempting to reactivate the wild mythal when they inadvertently freed Jack from his imprisonment in the stone. The drow immediately put Jack to work as a slave in the rothe pens, an arrangement Jack didnt care for. During his enslavement, Jack met a young noblewoman named Seila Norwood and Jack used his magical talents to escape with Seila to Ravens Bluff.
When Jack returned Seila to her father, Marden Norwood, Jack was richly rewarded with a 5,000 gold piece line of credit at the local counting house as well as the use of a stately Ravens Bluff mansion for several months. To gain the respect of Lord Norwood, Jack posed as a minor noble from the Vilhon Reach, the Landsgrave Jaer Kell Wildhame. Since the Vilhon Reach had been conveniently ravished by the Spellplague, it was difficult for anyone to verify his claim.
After settling into his new lifestyle, Jack learned that someone was offering a large reward for the Sarkonagael. Although he was surprised to learn the tome still existed in 1479 DR, he decided to find the book and claim the reward. Since Jack had possessed the book at one time, he was able to use the talents of a local gnome diviner named Aderbleen Krestner to determine the location of the book in Sarbreen.
Jack enlisted the help of the Blue Wyverns, a local adventuring group, to recover the Sarkonagael from Sarbreen. A few days later, Jack was tracked down by a mage from Iriaebor named Tarandor Delhamme. Tarandor had been the apprentice of the apprentice of the archmage who originally imprisoned Jack in the mythal and was under standing orders to return Jack to his imprisonment should he ever escape. Tarandor lured Jack to an ambush where Jack was shrunk and placed in a bottle for transport back to the Underdark. However, Jack was able to use a shadow walk spell from the Sarkonagael to escape his confinement.
After his escape, Jack cut the spell of Sarkons umbral simulacrum from the Sarkonagael and returned the tome for his reward. He used the spell to create a shadow simulacrum of himself, which he delivered to Tarandor in exchange for 2,000 gp. Later, Jack tricked the slaver Fetterfist into meeting him at a warehouse, where Jack and the Blue Wyverns ambushed and captured him.
Unfortunately, the city watch didnt believe Fetterfist was a slaver and they released him. Jack learned from a notebook taken from Fetterfist that he intended to attack a noble revel and deliver as many people to the drow as possible.  Jack rushed to the party and, with the help of the Blue Wyverns and Myrkyssa Jelan, was able to drive the drow back through a portal to the Underdark.
Jack jumped through the portal but was immediately captured by the drow. Lord Norwood and Myrkyssa Jelan led a large company into the Underdark and rescued Jack and the captured nobles. The drow attempted to reactivate the mythal but Jack used his wild magic to destroy the device. The destruction of the mythal took away all of Jacks wild magic.
