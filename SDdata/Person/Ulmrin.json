He was loyal only to himself and well known for his cruelty, cowardice, and self-centeredness.\nUlmrin was a rare half-orc of Waterdevhian origin. For a long time, he worked as a sellsword for adventuring parties but finally his bad reputation grew too much for him to continue in that line of work. Thus Ulmrin joined the Bull Elk Tribe criminal gang."
