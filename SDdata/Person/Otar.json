        "mainbody": "'''Otar''' was a young [[High Forest orc]] chieftain of the [[Grayvale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and a [[Green Regent]], a [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]], from [[1372 DR]] onward.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}<ref group=\"note\">Though they're Chosen of Mielikki, the Green Regents are not required to be followers of Mielikki, so Otar does not necessarily have Mielikki as a patron deity. As a High Forest orc, he likely follows [[Herne]].\n{{quote|For if I fail, Loudwater and the entire Delimbiyr Crescent may be doomed to the forces of darkness and tyranny.|Otar to adventurers<ref>}}",
        "History": "On [[Shieldmeet]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Otar led a band of fellow orcs from the [[High Forest]] into [[Loudwater]]'s [[Risen Moon Market]] with the intention of taking part in the ceremony held by the [[Circle of the Stag]] [[druid]]s to choose the next Green Regent. Though onlookers were shocked by the orc's presence, he drank the [[Greendraught]] without issue and was accepted as one of the [[Scions of the Green Regent]]. Then, during an overnight vigil in the High Forest undertaken by the Scions, Otar was met by a [[unicorn]] and led away, and ultimately granted the mantle of Green Regent by the goddess Mielikki herself. The next day, when Otar walked out of the High Forest the next day displaying the marks of the Green Regent, there was horror and outrage in Loudwater. claiming it was evidence of the ceremony being tainted or sabotaged. A few even doubted the validity of all the Scions, which nearly everyone rejected as ridiculous. Notoriously, family patriarch [[Halitan Phelaniityr]] vowed to rectify the situation before the Grayvale became, in his words, a \"cesspool of bestial orcish scum.\" Fearing violence might follow, the orcs, druids, and new Green Regent returned to the High Forest, leaving the Scions leaderless and people in Loudwater angry or afraid or else just waiting and wondering what Mielikki had in store.\n\nIn the months after, rumors flourished, with some claiming Otar and his orcs were in hiding while plotting to attack and sack the city, but others insisted they guarded the city in secret,<ref><ref> and still others that he had been murdered by the same anti-orc killer operating around the [[Red Boar Tavern]], who might be a Mielikkian set on \"making things right\".<ref> Otar was, for all intents and purposes, missing or in hiding<ref><ref> for the rest of the year. In truth, he was on a quest to learn more about his destiny and on a holy mission for Mielikki. High Forest orcs heard he'd traveled as far as [[Waterdeep]], visiting the [[Inn of the Dripping Dagger]].<ref>",
        "Description": "A large{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"Undermountain\" Plot Recap}} [[orc]] with gray skin, Otar bore the telltale markings of the Green Regent, in the form of intricate symbols of emerald hue that ran and entwined like ivy all over his body.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/Campaign Cards Promo Set}} He had a scar across his right forehead and cheek."
