'''Zoran Baenre''' was a member of [[House Baenre]] who was a second-year apprentice at [[Sorcere]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]]. Gromph considered him annoying.

==History==
He was one of the Baenre magic-users that [[Gromph Baenre]] gathered during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] for an attack on [[Nimor Imphraezl]] through a [[scrying]] crystal.
