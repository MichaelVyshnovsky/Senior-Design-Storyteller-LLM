Dennison the Jade was a devotee of Lathander who served the city of Myth Drannor as the senior priest in the late 7 and early 8 centuries DR.
By the advent of the Weeping War in 711 DR, Dennison the Jade had served the city of Myth Drannor for over twenty years. He stood side-by-side with the defenders of the city facing the Army of Darkness. All throughout the final years of the city, Dennison meticulously documented the events of the war and marked the locations of magic item caches hidden across the city by the surviving defenders.
Dennison fell alongside his fellow defenders of the city. But, before he did, according to stories, his fellows ripped his enchanted book Testament of Jade to pieces, to protect the information inside from the Army of Darkness.
Dennison was in possession of a book, the Testament of Jade, which was used by him to collect devotions and testimonies dedicated to Lathander. Somehow the book was imbued with divine magic via blessings of the deity or from exposure to the wild magics of the war.
