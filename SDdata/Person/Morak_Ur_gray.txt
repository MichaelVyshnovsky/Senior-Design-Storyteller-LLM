'''Morak Ur'gray''' was an innkeeper in [[Nightstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Morak managed an inn in the village of Nightstone.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], when the [[cloud giant]]s started their bombardment against Nightstone, Morak gathered as many villagers as possible and led them in their escape.

Taking refuge in nearby caves, however, Morak and his fellows were captured by the [[goblin]]s of Boss [[Hark]].

==Personality==
Morak was a natural leader and always optimistic. He thought for sure that Lady [[Velresa Nandar|Velrosa Nandar]] would send help for them.
