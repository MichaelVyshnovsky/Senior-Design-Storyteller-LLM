Morak Urgray was an innkeeper in Nightstone in the late 15 century DR.
Morak managed an inn in the village of Nightstone.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, sometime after the War of the Silver Marches, when the cloud giants started their bombardment against Nightstone, Morak gathered as many villagers as possible and led them in their escape.
Taking refuge in nearby caves, however, Morak and his fellows were captured by the goblins of Boss Hark.
Morak was a natural leader and always optimistic. He thought for sure that Lady Velrosa Nandar would send help for them.
