'''Keinen''' was a [[paladin]] in the service of [[Waterdeep]]'s temple of [[Torm]].

==Description==
Keinen was an elderly man with long locks of white hair, sporting a significant beard that nearly reached his waist. Underneath his armor he wore a lengthy, green gambeson.

==Personality==
Although his goal was to become the leader of Torm's Waterdhavian priesthood, Keinen knew deep inside that a quiet clerical life was not for him. His true passion was the art of combat, and he therefore chose to compromise by becoming a paladin.

==Possessions==
Keinen wore a suit of [[banded mail]]. In combat he rode a brown [[warhorse]] with chain [[barding]], and wielded a lance and shield.
