Gartos was a male mercenary warrior in service to Prince Belaur Aumar of Athalantar and was killed by Elminster Aumar. 
Gartos was one of the most trusted men of Belaur, which elevated him to the princes status and permitted him to be ranked above a minor magelord. Gartos was sent together with the magelord Eth Junster to Narthil in 234 DR to quell a revolt started by Elminster and Gartos was killed by the young wizard.
The magelords provided Gartos with a enchanted sword.
