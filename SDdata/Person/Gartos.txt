'''Gartos''' was a male mercenary warrior in service to Prince [[Belaur Aumar]] of [[Athalantar]] and was killed by [[Elminster Aumar]]. 

==History==
Gartos was one of the most trusted men of Belaur, which elevated him to the prince's status and permitted him to be ranked above a minor [[magelord]]. Gartos was sent together with the magelord [[Eth Junster]] to [[Narthil]] in [[234 DR]] to quell a revolt started by Elminster and Gartos was killed by the young wizard.

==Possessions==
The magelords provided Gartos with a enchanted sword.
