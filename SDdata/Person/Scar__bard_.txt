'''Scar''' was a traveling [[bard]] and entertainer from the [[Dragon Reach]] in the [[The Vast]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
As a bard, Scar possessed some knowledge of the [[arcane]] and could cast such [[spell]]s as ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', and ''[[invisibility]]''.

==Possessions==
Scar and his traveling companions carried several items they were willing to offer for trade. including a [[lute]], an [[iron]] [[skillet pan]], a spare set of [[leather armor]], and a bundle of [[silk]] [[rope]]. He was also armed with a simple [[short sword]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, or in the Year of Great Change of the Malatran calendar, Scar and his fellow bards, [[Absolute (bard)|Absolute]], [[Morton]], and [[Frenchy]], traveled to the village of [[Lion's Crossing]] to perform at a local festival. On their journey across the Dragon Reach, they came across a peculiar group of travelers, some of whom looked [[human]], and some were of more exotic species, all speaking in a strange language and armed in primitive weapons compared to the common equipment found in the region. The group was heroes of the Living Jungle from the far land of [[Malatra]] who were transported to the Dragon Reach in search of a [[headshrinker]]'s artifact. With the use of a ''[[tongues]]'' spell, the groups were able to communicate. The foreigners used strange words like [[garuda]] and [[katanga]] and seemingly did not know what the beasts of burden that dragged the bards' wagon were. And the wagon itself was an alien piece of technology for the Malatrans. The bards and the Heroes of the Living Jungle parted ways after partaking in some trade.
