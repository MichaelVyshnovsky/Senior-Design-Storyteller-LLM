Aborana Startoucher was a famous oracle and fortune teller in Memnon, before having to relocate to the Calling Horns.
Famous for her accuracy as a seer, Aborana would often give advice to those whose fortunes were less than pleasant. One day, she read the fortune of a merchant, seeing an unholy and bloody death. This fate seemed to emanate from the Nether Regions, thus she was unable to advise the merchant around it. He cursed her and her family for this perceived slight many of whom died shortly thereafter.
After escaping to the North, Aborana heard of the merchants death at the hands of a multi-limbed abomination.
Since she resettled in the Calling Horn Inn, Aborana became quite an avid book collector. She came across a small tome bound in scaly red leather. Members of the Kraken Society in Yartar were actively seeking this book, believing it to be within her possession. They constantly harassed her since discovering its whereabouts.
