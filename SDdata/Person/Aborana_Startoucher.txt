'''Aborana Startoucher''' was a famous oracle and fortune teller in [[Memnon]], before having to relocate to the [[Calling Horns]].

==History==
Famous for her accuracy as a seer, Aborana would often give advice to those whose fortunes were less than pleasant. One day, she read the fortune of a merchant, seeing an unholy and bloody death. This fate seemed to emanate from the [[Nether Regions]], thus she was unable to advise the merchant around it. He cursed her and her family for this perceived slight; many of whom died shortly thereafter.

After escaping to the [[North]], Aborana heard of the merchant's death at the hands of a multi-limbed abomination.

Since she resettled in the Calling Horn Inn, Aborana became quite an avid book collector. She came across a small tome bound in scaly red leather. Members of the [[Kraken Society]] in [[Yartar]] were actively seeking this book, believing it to be within her possession. They constantly harassed her since discovering its whereabouts.
