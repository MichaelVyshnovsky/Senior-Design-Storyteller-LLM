Daelan Red Tiger was a male half-orc barbarian raised by the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. He was an honorable warrior out to prove himself in the world, hoping to amend for his fathers orc blood, and to end the exile by his tribe. He carried a spectacular double-axe and also had a longbow for a ranged weapon. When the Wailing Death struck Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, Daelan offered his services to the Hero of Neverwinter to investigate the plague.
