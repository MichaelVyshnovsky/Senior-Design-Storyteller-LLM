They belonged to old families that feuded for as long as they remembered. The couple first laid their eyes on each other in the citys market. Their passion grew hotter when they touched for the first time while attending the citys theater. And eventually, they were consumed by young love on a balcony of the citys Dukes ball. The youth knew their families would never approve of their union and decided to run away from the societal pressures and prejudices. Patrolio promised to drive a boat to Galenias home on the river under cover of darkness. Unfortunately for the young lovers, they were doomed the moment someone overheard their plans.\nIt was unknown whether it was Patrolios family or Galenias, but it was obvious that they were responsible for drilling a hole in the young mans boat. The rivers deep currents took Patrolio while Galenia waited for her paramour until the break of dawn. Subsequently, Galenia died of a broken heart, thinking her lover abandoned her."
