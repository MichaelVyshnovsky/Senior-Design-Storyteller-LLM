'''Hung Te Ping''' was a poet and a great [[Celestial_Empire#Sages|sage]] of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] in [[Kara-Tur]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

The Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]] maintained a long friendship with Hung Te Ping, whom he consulted and conversed with often.

The [[Horseshoe Temple Oasis]] in the [[Quoya Desert]] was believed to have been a place where Hung Te Ping stopped on one of his journeys between Kara-Tur and the [[Outer Planes]].
