'''Gaagash''' was an [[orc]] [[bloodrager]] of the [[Many-Arrows Kingdom]], active in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the tumultuous century that followed the ''[[Spellplague]]'', orcs of the Many-Arrows Kingdom expanded their influence into the [[Sword Coast North]]. Gaagash was put in charge of the Many-Arrows orcs who held the [[Ash Ridge]] along the [[Thunderhoof Pass]] in the [[Sword Mountains]] that led towards the [[Old Owl Well]]. Gaagash and his followers were defeated by adventurers financed by Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] of [[Neverwinter]], tasked with reclaiming the Old Owl Well.
