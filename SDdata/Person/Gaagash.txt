Gaagash was an orc bloodrager of the Many-Arrows Kingdom, active in the 15 century DR.
During the tumultuous century that followed the Spellplague, orcs of the Many-Arrows Kingdom expanded their influence into the Sword Coast North. Gaagash was put in charge of the Many-Arrows orcs who held the Ash Ridge along the Thunderhoof Pass in the Sword Mountains that led towards the Old Owl Well. Gaagash and his followers were defeated by adventurers financed by Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter, tasked with reclaiming the Old Owl Well.
