Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen was a korobokuru bushi in Shou Lung around 1357 DR.
Hsiao Nan worked as a retainer of a wealthy merchant from Linshung.
Around 1357 DR, Kuang Ming Ling, the daughter of his employer, decided to go on pilgrimage to a far-away monastery. Her father sent with her Hsiao Nan and another korobokuru retainer to protect the girl. 
Hsiao always encouraged Kuang Ming to go to inns, wine shops, and all other kinds of food or drink shops. He liked tackling "over-stuffed humans with clumsy swords".
Kuang Ming traveled with two korobokuru retainers of her father Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen and Ling Yu Pao.
