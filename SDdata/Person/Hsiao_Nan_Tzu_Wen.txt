'''Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen''' was a [[korobokuru]] [[bushi]] in [[Shou Lung]] around [[1357 DR]].
   
==Activities==
Hsiao Nan worked as a retainer of a wealthy merchant from [[Linshung]].

==History==
Around 1357 DR, [[Kuang Ming Ling]], the daughter of his employer, decided to go on pilgrimage to a far-away monastery. Her father sent with her Hsiao Nan and another [[korobokuru]] retainer to protect the girl. 

==Personality==
Hsiao always encouraged Kuang Ming to go to inns, wine shops, and all other kinds of food or drink shops. He liked tackling "over-stuffed [[human]]s with clumsy swords".

==Relationships==
Kuang Ming traveled with two korobokuru retainers of her father: Hsiao Nan Tzu Wen and [[Ling Yu Pao]].
