'''Gill''' was a member of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]] in the late 15{{th}} century. 

==History==
Around [[1490 DR]], Gill, along with fellow members of the Burning Dawn [[Neddy]], [[Calick]], and [[Bryn Lightfingers]], was escorting a merchant caravan along the [[High Road]] between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]], when the caravan was ambushed by the [[Snarling Fang]] mercenary company. The members of the Burning Dawn were brought to the hideout of the mercenaries and killed. Accused of being [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]], [[Neddy]] and Gill were both executed by Sir [[Banagar]], who carried out the sentence with a sword on the order of [[Javen Tarmikos]].
