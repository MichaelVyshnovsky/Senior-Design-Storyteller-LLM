        "mainbody": "Idrizraele was a Morueme blue dragon that lived in the Morueme lair within the Nether Mountains until the 14 century DR.\nIn 1371 DR the patriarch of the Morueme dragon clan. Kizilpazar, was killed by his power-hungry sons, Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim. As Idrizraele was the elder dragons younger mate, she was driven out of the clans ancestral home by the two younger males. Whether out of frustration, despair, or rage, Idrizraele assaulted the nearby Ladys Hand Monastery and was blasted away by the clergy of Loviatar, via weapons from ancient Netheril.\nOddly enough, her death was avenged by Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim, who proceeded to destroy over half of temples Loviatan inhabitants."
