'''Nimir''' was a [[storm giant]] residing in the [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] in the [[Trackless Sea]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
==Personality==
Nimir was a rather insightful giant who believed that his race should establish an alliance with the smaller races, rather than continuously warring with them. To this end he felt that the princess [[Serissa]] was a perfect successor to the throne of King [[Hekaton]] and was willing to sacrifice his life in order to protect her.
==History==
Nimir was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator [[Uthor]] in the [[Hekaton|Storm King]]'s assault on [[Iymrith]]'s lair. He fought alongside [[Orlekto]], [[Shaldoor]], and [[Vaasha]].
