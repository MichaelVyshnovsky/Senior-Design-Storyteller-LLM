Nimir was a storm giant residing in the Maelstrom in the Trackless Sea during the late 15 century DR.
Nimir was a rather insightful giant who believed that his race should establish an alliance with the smaller races, rather than continuously warring with them. To this end he felt that the princess Serissa was a perfect successor to the throne of King Hekaton and was willing to sacrifice his life in order to protect her.
Nimir was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator Uthor in the Storm Kings assault on Iymriths lair. He fought alongside Orlekto, Shaldoor, and Vaasha.
