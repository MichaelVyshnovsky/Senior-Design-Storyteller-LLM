        "mainbody": "'''Amraith''' was a [[moon elf]] [[fighter]] adventurer, a member of the [[Hands of Fury]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Amraith was an ousted elven nobleman turned adventurer, thanks to his skills in wielding weapons and [[ambidexterity]]. He was a man of cool demeanor and efficiency. Amraith's elven nature granted him speed that exceeded that of his teammates. His quick mind often resulted in won arguments.",
        "Possessions": "Amraith was armed with a [[shortbow]], but when faced with melee, he wielded a duo of a [[short sword]] and a [[dagger]].",
        "History": "Amraith joined his adventuring group sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, when he, along with the Hands of Fury, traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of [[Luskan]], ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of [[Targos]], besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]."
