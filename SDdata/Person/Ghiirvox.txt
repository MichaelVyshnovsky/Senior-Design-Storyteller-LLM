Ghiirvox was the leader of the Scoured Legion in 1479 DR. 
Ghiirvox was very reserved and calculating for a tanarukk. He suspected rightly that the Grand Bloodreaver Jeervan, a follower of Garagos, would soon move to supplant him as warchief.
Unusual for a tanarukk, Ghiirvox had violet-blue skin, suggesting a very particular demon among his ancestors.
Ghiirvox was a veteran of twelve conflicts in the Underdark. He ascended to his current position when his predecessor succumbed to Araumycoss madness. In 1479 DR, his position was threatened by Garagos worshipers, who were spreading in the Legion, and their leader Jeervan.
