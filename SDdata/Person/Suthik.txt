Suthik was a duergar raid leader in 1484 DR.
Just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches, the king of Gracklstugh ordered Suthik to lead a duergar band inside the Underdark section of Citadel Adbar in order to recover the Wand of TirLien, which had been sold to drow. During the exploration, however, a mimic killed many of the Suthiks thugs. At last, Suthik and his surviving minions retreated into a cave. There they were attacked and defeated by an adventuring party hired by King Harbromm.
