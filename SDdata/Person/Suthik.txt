'''Suthik''' was a [[duergar]] raid leader in [[1484 DR]].
   
==History==
Just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the king of [[Gracklstugh]] ordered Suthik to lead a duergar band inside the [[Underdark]] section of [[Citadel Adbar]] in order to recover the [[Wand of Tir'Lien]], which had been sold to [[drow]]. During the exploration, however, a [[mimic]] killed many of the Suthik's thugs. At last, Suthik and his surviving minions retreated into a cave. There they were attacked and defeated by an adventuring party hired by King [[Harbromm]].
