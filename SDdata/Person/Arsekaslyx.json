        "Relationship": "Arsekaslyx enjoyed playing with the Cult's commanders in the Well; she kept her presence secret from [[Naergoth Bladelord]] to avoid a confrontation for power. On the other hand, she tempted [[Vargo Kent]] with the secret of becoming a [[half-dragon]] [[dracolich]].",
        "History": "In order to retain her sanity during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], she used an artifact called the ''[[bone scepter of Zceryll]]'', known as the \"the star-spawn\", which protected her from the Rage's effects but also warped her physiology.\n\nShe arrived at the Well of Dragons in around 1373 DR and remained there until at least [[1479 DR]].",
