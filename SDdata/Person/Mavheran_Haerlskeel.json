She was known for being an experienced trapper and scout, as were many within her clan.\nHer advisor was a wizard named Halvena Fallowfield.\nClanlord Haerlskeel had a fear that an inevitable war between the orc tribes would soon devastate their region. Due to this, she believed in keeping her people hidden from the rest of the Silver Marches."
