        "mainbody": "Firble was a svirfneblin councilor of King Schnicktick in Blingdenstone in the midâ€“14 century DR. He also had secret dealings with Jarlaxle, who traded information with him.\nThe deep gnome had stubby fingers and was going bald. Firble stood about  tall and weighed around .\nFirble could be impatient, and though he feared Jarlaxle, he was willing to press the mercenary for information, even if the drow pressed back. The deep gnome hated all types of light sources, including torchlight.\nInstead of wearing metal armor, Firble dressed in long smooth robes.\nAround 1357 DR, Firble grew more and more suspicious and fearful of the drow creeping around in the Underdark. After \"prompting\" from Belwar Dissengulp, Firble agreed to escort Catti-brie to the drow city of Menzoberranzan.\nAfter the Battle of Keepers Dale, Belwar Dissengulp carried Firbles body away from the battlefield."
