        "mainbody": "'''Nell Kirschtorte''' was a kindly baker who ran her pastry business - [[Nell's Pie Shop]], out of her home in [[Liam's Hold]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Nell was a pleasant and plump middle-aged woman with chestnut hair, always covered in [[flour]]. She preferred to wear light blue robes when running her business.",
        "History": "Nell was not rich and could not afford to rent a space so she spent long hours baking and selling her goods from her humble home. She baked [[bread]] but her specialty were [[cherry pie]]s, filled to the brim with [[elderflower wine]] drenched red and black [[cherries]], fruit-stuffed [[eccles cake]]s, and [[toffee apple]]s.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Nell lived with her young daughter [[Jemmy Kirschtorte]] and her pet bat [[Mr. Barnabus]]. That year, Nell's daughter became besieged by bad dreams. And after investigation by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] it was revealed the family was stalked by a [[drow]] [[vampire]] [[Sieronius Dethick]]. The girl's nightmares came from the vampire searching for a bride to escape his trapping ''[[curse]]'' underneath Liam's Hold. When the vampire realized Jemmy was a child, he turned his eyes on Nell Kirschtorte. Thankfully, Jemmy was an emerging [[sorceress]] and could talk to her bat pet. [[Mr. Barnabus]] felt the coming of the creature of the night and woke Jemmy up. When Sieronius arrived to Nell's Pie Shop in his mist form, he realized that the family was not asleep and left them alone, turning his attention to [[Xanda Pennywell]], a seamstress from the same hamlet.\n\nFollowing the resolution of the vampire situation, Nell Kirschtorte became aware of her daughter's sorcerous talents but was unsure how to deal with it."
