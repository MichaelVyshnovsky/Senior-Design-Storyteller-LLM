'''Miffles''' was a pet [[Dog|terrier]] that belonged to Lady [[Bantakent]], a merchant from the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the [[1490 DR|1490s DR]],{{HAT-time}} the Bantakent manse in Neverwinter was being robbed by [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] of [[Targos]]. Edgin's daughter [[Kira]], while ''[[invisibility|invisible]]'' terrorized the Lord and the Lady of the house as a distraction. Kira pretended to be a [[poltergeist]] and terrorized the household by smashing plates and floating priceless vases. Little Miffles was among the floating objects carried by Kira. The dog enjoyed the time of his doggy life while his mistress screamed in terror.
