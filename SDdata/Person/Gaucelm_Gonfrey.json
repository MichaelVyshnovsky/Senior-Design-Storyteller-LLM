        "mainbody": "Lord '''Gaucelm Gonfrey''' was once the ruler of the kingdom of [[Grimmantle]] after usurping the throne from its aged king.",
        "Personality": "Gonfrey had a penchant for the finer things in life, even in [[undead|undeath]] he would spare no expense on outfitting his chambers or wardrobe with finery.",
        "History": "In [[304 DR]], Gaucelm Gonfrey seized upon the opportunity to take the throne of Grimmantle from its elderly king, becoming known afterwards as the \"thief-king\" by his subjects. However, Gonfrey's rule was cut short a year later when he was murdered by the poisoned arrow of an [[assassin]] and buried far beneath [[The Crags]]. \n\nMany centuries passed as Gonfrey rested in death until [[Myrkul]], lord of the dead, decided to bestow the gift of undeath upon him in the months prior to the [[Time of Troubles]]. None know what the Lord of Bones had planned for Gonfrey as the [[Deity]] perished in [[Waterdeep]] soon after Gonfrey's rising. With his new powers and abilities as a [[Death knight]], Gonfrey wandered the [[North]] for years, eventually making his way home to the ruins of Grimmantle. \n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Gonfrey had moved back into his old keep and gathered a small group of [[human]]s which he hopes to build into a new kingdom of Grimmantle. Aided by the [[Illusion]]s of his new \"court mage\" [[Quaerel Nhommingtun]], the thief-king hides his undead nature from the others around him.",
