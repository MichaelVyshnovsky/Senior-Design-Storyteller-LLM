        "mainbody": "Myrin Darkdance, whose birth name was Maerlyn, was a young spellscarred human wizard originally from Westgate.\nMyrins father Neveren Darkdance was a half-elf, probably half-drow,A picture of Myrins father showed him to have particularly dusky skin, and magic in his home responded to commands spoken in the Drow language. and her mother Shalis Ptolexis was of Mulhorandi descent.\nMyrin had one of the most powerful spellscars known to exist. She was able to absorb and use the magical abilities and memories of any creature she came into contact with. She could also absorb and contain harmful spellscars such as those that plagued Kalen Dren and Ilira Nathalan. Fayne hinted that part of Mystra might be trapped inside Myrin and she believed Myrin would eventually bring about the destruction of the world by siphoning and then accidentally unleashing the magic of an extremely powerful being. This may have been the motivation of Lilten when he attempted to kidnap Myrin because, as a follower of Beshaba, the ultimate misfortune he could cause the world would be its destruction.\nMyrin was born into the noble House Darkdance of Westgate in the . Her father Neveren was a member of the Night Masks and was killed in the same year that she was born, leaving her mother Shalis, a Celebrant of Sharess, to raise her alone. In her youth, Myrin ran away from her mother and apprenticed herself to wizards all over Faerûn, in an attempt to become an incantatrix, even apprenticing under Manshoon while he was using the identity of Orbakh. At some point during or after the Spellplague of 1385 DR, Myrin was trapped in a pocket of Spellplague. \nMyrin manifested in Waterdeep from time to time as a weeping young woman surrounded by blue flame. In the , the paladin Kalen Dren came across Myrins spectre and rescued her from the patch of Spellplague she was trapped in. Kalen befriended Myrin and took her back to the rowhouse he shared with his adopted sister Cellica and the two nursed Myrin back to health. She appeared to have little-to-no memory of her past.\nKalen later escorted Myrin to a costume ball at the temple of Sune in Waterdeep. Myrin was abducted from the ball by minions of Beshabas high priest, Lilten. However, she was able to escape when she drained the magic of a lich and then turned the power against the creature. Unfortunately, she nearly destroyed the nearby buildings.\nMyrin was later kidnapped by another of Liltens employees, Rath, who imprisoned her in a bell tower. She was once again rescued by Kalen who captured Rath and turned him over to the City Watch. As thanks for Kalens actions, Myrin siphoned some of the Spellplague that was killing Kalen out of his body.\nIn the , Myrin was traveling through north Faerûn in a dwarven caravan when it was attacked by Sithe, a high-ranking member of the Dead Rats gang in Luskan.  Sithe took Myrin back to the Dead Rats headquarters. The gang realized that, because of Myrins power, they couldnt hold her against her will so they told her she was the new queen of the gang, which placated her. Shortly thereafter, Kalen arrived to rescue her but found she was content in her new role.\nMyrin took it upon herself to investigate the cause of the Fury plague that was sweeping Luskan. She made several forays with Kalen and Sithe into Luskan but was unable to locate the cause of the malady. Later, the trio, along with a young paladin named Rhetegast Hawkwinter found the demon responsible for the plague in Luskans underground and apparently destroyed him.\nLater in 1480 DR, Myrin traveled with Kalen to Westgate to determine what became of Rhett. While in Westgate, Myrin discovered her ancestral home, Darkdance Manor. Shortly thereafter, she met Ilira Nathalan, who had been a student of her fathers. Myrin followed Ilira around Westgate and investigated the Lair of the Night Masters. Myrin helped to defeat Fayne when she attacked Ilira to avenge her mothers death.\nMyrin was attracted to Kalen and was heartbroken when he slept with Fayne. At some point prior to the Spellplague, Myrin was lovers with Umbra and Lord Methrammar Aerasumé of Silverymoon was attracted to her.\nMyrin had unusual features that made her origin difficult to place. Although she believed herself to be from a city beginning with \"West\" (perhaps Westgate), Myrin had dusky skin, slightly pointed ears, and appeared to be partly half-elven, Calishite, or possibly Mulan. In 1479 DR, shortly after Kalen freed her from the Spellplague fragment, Myrin was very thin, apparently from a lack of eating or an extremely fast metabolism. By 1480 DR, Myrin had filled out nicely and was no longer a skinny waif. When she used her spellscar, glowing blue runes appeared on her skin.\nBy 1480 DR, Myrin was a vegetarian."
