Sabyna was a ships mage in 1370 DR.
Sabyna lived all her life on the sea. Her father Siann Truesail and two of her brothers were also ships mages.
Thanks to her family, Sabyna had a network of contacts among ships mages, captains, sailors and merchants.
Sabyna had great social skills that permitted her to be at home with all kinds of people. She constantly fed half-true gossip. She loved cooking, especially very spicy foods and all kinds of exotic dishes, and entertaining guests. Sabyna loved her ship the Breezerunner. She fell in love with Jherek Wolfs-get but had doubts about their life together.
