'''Slag''' was a [[fire giant]] of the [[Greypeak Mountains]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] who served in the army of [[Hellgate Keep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Slag was large and powerful, even among other fire giants.

==Possessions==
Slag owned a ''[[potion of cloud giant control]]'', as well as a ''[[ring of spell turning]]''. He had a pet [[gorgon]] named [[George (gorgon)|George]]. He carried boulders to throw at his enemies.

==History==
Slag used his domineering nature to become a leader of all the giants who lived in the Greypeak Mountains. In his youth, he got into a disagreement with a young [[cloud giant]], whose parents retaliated by throwing him out of his leadership position. Slag attempted to get revenge by forcing an [[alchemist]] into brewing a ''potion of cloud giant control'' for him, but the cloud giants left before he could use it.

Slag also killed a young [[red dragon]], from whose hoard he took a ''ring of spell turning''. He defeated a party of [[human]] [[adventurer]]s by throwing rocks at them, and claimed their gorgon, who became his pet named George.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Slag worked under the [[lich]] [[Pomerian]] (who in turn served [[Grintharke]] of [[Hellgate Keep]]). Slag fought without George in a clash between Pomerian's army and forces from [[Loudwater]] led by [[Nanathlor Greysword]], east of Loudwater.{{Cite dungeon/28/The Pipes of Doom|11}} Later, when the [[Pipes of Doom]] had been stolen from Pomerian by some [[korred]]s, Slag was sent along with [[Lilliana]], [[Dammek]] and [[Dammon (human)|Dammon]] to recover them from the Korred's camp.{{Cite dungeon/28/The Pipes of Doom|28}}
