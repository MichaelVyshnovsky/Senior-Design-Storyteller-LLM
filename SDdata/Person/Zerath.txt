Zerath was a dragonborn of Abeir, and one of the ancestors of Clan Kepeshkmolik.
Zerath was one of the seven wise elders who raised Shasphur.
One day, Shaspur came with a plan to free the dragonborn slaves from the gold dragon Raurokhymdhar. His plan, however, had a flaw he could not save the elders. The elders decided that Shaspur should flee without them. Zerath was killed by Raurokhymdhar while misleading the dragon so Shaspur and the other slaves could flee to freedom.
