Ladrelas Tranth was a successful merchant from Var who later operated in Amn in the 14 century DR.
Similar to his fellow Jonstal Halavur, Ladrelas was originally from Var, but moved to Purskul in order to earn even more money at some point after the Tethyrian Interregnum. In the process of building his fortune, he sponsored and invested in certain Tethyrian nobles who he thought would provide the region with stability through sensible politics and the building of infrastructure. As such, he was partially responsible for Tethyrs rise from the ruins of the civil war and subsequent period of prosperity.
