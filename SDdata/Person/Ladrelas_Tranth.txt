'''Ladrelas Tranth''' was a successful merchant from [[Var]] who later operated in [[Amn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Similar to his fellow [[Jonstal Halavur]], Ladrelas was originally from Var, but moved to [[Purskul]] in order to earn even more money at some point after the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]]. In the process of building his fortune, he sponsored and invested in certain [[Tethyr]]ian nobles who he thought would provide the region with stability through sensible politics and the building of infrastructure. As such, he was partially responsible for Tethyr's rise from the ruins of the civil war and subsequent period of prosperity.
