        "mainbody": "'''Vala Thorsdotter''' was the great-granddaughter of [[Bodvar the Black]] and a leader of her clan's warriors at the [[Granite Tower]] of [[Vaasa]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|83}} She played a key role in [[Melegaunt Tanthul]]'s successful scheme to summon the [[Shade Enclave]] to [[Faer√ªn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.",
        "Description": "Vala was both nimble and muscular, with auburn hair and green eyes. She was a deeply honorable yet pragmatic woman who had spartan tastes and a cynical disregard for luxury. She was a hardened warrior, a capable leader, and an incorrigible lecher, and had a reputation for being mercurial such that she could be serious, silly, and seductive all in the same breath. She was illiterate as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Possessions": "Vala was a skilled wielder of her family's ''[[darksword]]'', one of twenty black glass weapons given to her ancestor [[Bodvar the Black]] by [[Melegaunt Tanthul]], one of the [[Princes of Shade]]. The blade rendered most [[Weave]]-based protective enchantments and [[spells]] useless, and gave her a limited ability to [[scry]] on the goings-on in the bedchambers of the Granite Tower.\n\nComplementing her black ''darkblade'', she was known to ride into battle clad completely in black, including her [[horse]] (named [[Raven (horse)|Raven]]), her [[cloak]], and her [[scale armor]].",
        "Relationships": "Vala took her duties to her clan very seriously, and had devoted much of her life to keeping them safe from the dangers of Vaasa. She was quite close with her family, including her grandparents as well as her sickly father, in whose honor she wielded their ''darksword''.\n\nVala was known to be very sexually aggressive toward men she found attractive, including the [[elf]] [[Galaeron Nihmedu]]. She was not close to her son's father, and may not have even known or cared who he was. \n\nVala strongly believed that her people had benefited greatly from the boons given to them by Melegaunt Tanthul, which included both the ''darkswords'' and the Granite Tower itself. As such, when the time came to fulfill her great-grandfather's debt to him, she was more than happy to serve him irrespective of being honor-bound to do so.",
        "History": "Vala was born sometime in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century DR in the Granite Tower. Her clan was bound by a pact that her great-grandfather, Bodvar the Black, had made with the [[wizard]] Melegaunt Tanthul in the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, such that they were to dispatch twenty warriors to assist him if he demanded it. Melegaunt invoked the pact in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, by which point Vala was an accomplished warrior and leader among her people as well as a new mother of a young son.{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|81}} \n\nVala and her men were given a mission to excavate a tomb beneath [[Evereska]] and gain access to the [[Sharn Wall]], so she captured a [[beholder]] en-route to assist with the digging. Her party ended up coming into conflict with an [[Evereskan tomb guardian]] named Galaeron Nihmedu, and the ensuing [[magical]] battle between this elven wizard and Melegaunt inadvertently broke the Sharn Wall and allowed the [[phaerimm]] to escape and wreak havoc in Evereska. After a terse meeting with the Evereskan [[Hill Elders]], Vala, Melegaunt, and Galaeron would then travel to [[Karse]] based on Melegaunt's promise that it held a way to save Evereska and the rest of [[Faerun]] from the phaerimm.{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|79}}\n\nMelegaunt would end up killed at Karse by the [[Wulgreth]] [[liches]], but not before tricking Vala and Galaeron into believing that only his people, the [[Arcanist|arcanists]] of [[Netheril]], could defeat the phaerimm. Acting on this belief, Galaeron tapped into the power of the [[Shadow Weave]] and summoned the [[shade]] [[Netherese enclave|city]] of [[Thultanthar]] from the [[Plane of Shadow]]. She was subsequently rescued when Galaeron joined forces with [[Khelben Arunsun]] and four of the [[Seven Sisters]] to strike at the Netherese.\n\nFollowing these events, Vala returned home to her son and the Granite Tower in [[1372 DR]] accompanied by Galaeron and his lover, [[Takari Moonsnow]]."
