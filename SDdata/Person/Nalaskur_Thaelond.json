        "mainbody": "Nalaskur Thaelond was an innkeeper of the Bargewright Inn and a member of the Zhentarim during the Elemental Evil crisis in 1491 DR.\nFrom his inn, Nalaskur was able to keep tabs on all travelers. The Zhentarim also used Nalaskurs inn as a meeting point and a place for storing illicit goods en route to Waterdeep.\nOccasionally he would call upon one of his inns few permanent residents, the vampire Arik Stillmarsh, to dispose of unwanted guests.\nIn the late 15 Century DR, Nalaskur sent a group of adventurers to escort a beer wagon to the Troll in Flames tavern in Mornbryns Shield.\nAround this same time period he had made Arik Stillmarsh agree to feed upon neither locals nor guests without the Zhentarims approval"
