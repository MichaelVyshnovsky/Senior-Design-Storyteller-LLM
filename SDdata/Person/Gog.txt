Gog was an ogre who allied himself with a group of scouts from the Many-Arrows tribe.
The filthy ogre was fearless in combat, and would fight until he was slain.
Circa 1491 DR, Gog met with orcs of the Many-Arrows tribe, and their leader, Brughor Axe-Biter. The group had just been pillaging and plundering, and eventually moved to a cave in Wyvern Tor.
