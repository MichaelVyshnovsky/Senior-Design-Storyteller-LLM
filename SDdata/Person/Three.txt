==Description==
She wore a simple leather vest and short pants as well as some simple, animal-bone jewelry.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of [[adventurer]]s and [[Halsin|their bear]] tried to sneak into the Shattered Sanctum. The intruders were caught and imprisoned in the dungeons of the Shattered Sanctum. Three and her friend [[One]] spent a wonderful time torturing the [[bear]] and throwing rocks at it.
