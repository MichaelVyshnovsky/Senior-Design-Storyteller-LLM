'''Hyuth Kolstaag''' was an inhabitant of [[Triboar]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
Hyuth was an adventurer until in the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]] rich he retired and settled in Triboar. However his arrogance gained him no friends in town. Instead he was targeted by many enemies and rivals.
After a trio of assassins tried to kill him in his bed, Kolstaag hired four [[gargoyle]]s guard.
