Sergeant Carlton was a guard who worked in the employ of the noble Seasilver family of Marsember during the late 15 century DR.
He had a rather grizzled appearance.
Carlton was one of the few people who knew that the young Lady Arietta Seasilver often spent her time moonlighting as a minstrel in Marsembers taverns. Lady Arietta trusted Carlton and he of course did all he could to ensure her safety and wellbeing.
On Uktar 2 of the , the city of Marsember was being evacuated due to the Shadovar invasion of Cormyr. On that day, Carlton and his men were tasked with escorting Lady Arietta to the Wave Wyvern by Lord Farnig Seasilver, Unfortunately, the young lady evaded his escort, delaying the Wave Wyverns departure.
When it became apparent that Lady Elisa Seasilver was aboard the vessel when it was captured by shades, Carlton and his men joined Arietta, under the guise of Lady Emmeline, aboard the Lonely Roamer to rescue the abducted noblewoman.
