Sergeant '''Carlton''' was a guard who worked in the employ of the noble [[Seasilver]] family of [[Marsember]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had a rather grizzled appearance.

==Relationships==
Carlton was one of the few people who knew that the young Lady [[Arietta Seasilver]] often spent her time moonlighting as a minstrel in Marsember's taverns. Lady Arietta trusted Carlton and he of course did all he could to ensure her safety and wellbeing.

==History==
On [[Uktar 2]] of the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, the city of Marsember was being evacuated due to the [[Shadovar]] invasion of [[Cormyr]]. On that day, Carlton and his men were tasked with escorting Lady Arietta to the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]'' by Lord [[Farnig Seasilver]], Unfortunately, the young lady evaded his escort, delaying the ''Wave Wyvern's'' departure.

When it became apparent that Lady [[Elisa Seasilver]] was aboard the vessel when it was captured by [[shade]]s, Carlton and his men joined Arietta, under the guise of Lady Emmeline, aboard the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]'' to rescue the abducted noblewoman.
