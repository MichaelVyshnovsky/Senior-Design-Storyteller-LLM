        "mainbody": "'''General Vandemar Cordwin''' was a particularly powerful and influential [[priest]] of [[Tempus]] in the city of [[Arrabar]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], General Cordwin would often give boisterous and angry public tirades against [[Baron Thuragar]] of [[Ormpetarr]] to his clergy. Though these firebrand speeches were supported by the ruling family of Arrabar their reasoning was something of a mystery.",
        "Personality": "Although he was known as a strong-willed and energetic leader, he had the reputation of being somewhat of a zealot.",
        "Possessions": "Along with the [[magic]]al [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s that would expected of a leader within the [[church of Tempus]], General Cordwin wore a ''[[ring of spell turning]]'' and carried a ''[[rod of passage]]''."
