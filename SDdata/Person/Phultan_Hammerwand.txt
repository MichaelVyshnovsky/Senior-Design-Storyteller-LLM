'''Phultan Hammerwand''' was a [[vampire]] and member of the [[Night Masters]], the cabal of vampires who led the [[Night Masks]].

==Description==
Quite peculiar for a vampire lord, Phultan's diet of blood had changed his previously corpulent physique to one of sagging flesh. Lank and patchy reddish-brown hair hung from the back of his head.

By [[1480 DR]], Phultan was horrific looking; decades without feeding had left him with lesions all over his body.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|2522}}
 
==History==
In life, Phultan was a silver-tongued fence and information dealer, making his way under the cover of a merchant trader of luxuries. Forming contacts all across the [[Heartlands]], he cultivated an ever-growing web of traded information.

However, during one of Phultan's many trips to [[Westgate]], he stumbled across information that was highly sensitive regarding a lieutenant of the [[Night Masks]]. Hunted by [[Dahlia Vhammos]], the Duchess of Venom, it was only Phultan's information-gathering skills that saved him as he managed to learn the correct way of contacting the [[Manshoon|Night King]] himself. Impressed by his display of skills, the Night King not only spared Phultan but transformed him into a vampire, thereby inducting him as the second member of the Court of the Night Masters.

Operating from then on as [[Manshoon|Orbakh]]'s spymaster and 'duke of whispers'. By [[1372 DR]] Phultan remained mostly in Westgate, using informants and spies to remain one of the most informed individuals of the city.

Later, however, Phultan was locked by [[Manshoon]] in the [[Lair of the Night Masters]] for nearly 100 years and was slowly starving when a group led by [[Ilira Nathalan]] and [[Myrin Darkdance]] entered the lair and destroyed him in [[1480 DR]].{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|2647}}
