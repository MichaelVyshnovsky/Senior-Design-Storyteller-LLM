'''Ormalagos''', also known as '''Needle''', was an [[Dragon aging|adult]] [[green dragon]] who was killed by a tribe of [[batiri]] [[goblin]]s in [[Chult]].

==Abilities==
Per [[Sammaster]], the nickname "Needle" was an allusion to her skills in torture: she keep creatures in states of incredible pain for hours using only her claws, despite her size. She was also capable of casting spells, most likely ''[[ice darts]]'' and ''[[shadow spray]]''.{{cite book/The Rage|14}} 

==History==
On [[Uktar 9]] of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, she was in the [[Gray Forest]] near [[Impiltur]], accompanied by the black dragon [[Dransagalor]]; while in the throes of a nascent [[Rage of Dragons]], she attacked Sammaster and [[Cylla Morieth]]. The lich responded by casting a ''[[abate dracorage]]'' to calm the rage, and then offering her the transformation into a [[dracolich]] in return for her help in running a local enclave of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. She did not refuse at the time.

Ormalagos kept her lair in Chult, in the sinkhole that would come to be known as [[Needle's Bones]]. She rightly suspected her lair had been discovered by batiri raiders, and was in the process of moving her hoard to a new lair when the goblins struck. While she was away, they filled the murky water at the bottom of the sinkhole with masses of [[quipper]]s, and upon her return, trapped her inside using vine nets. Caught between the quippers eating her from below, and the batiri pelting her with spears from above, Ormalagos eventually died, but not before killing nearly the entire goblin tribe.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a pair of legendary claw-like weapons existed in Chult. These ''[[Needle's Rest]]'' claws were believed to had been crafted using claws of Ormalagos herself.
