'''Knuckles''' was the name of a semi-tame [[deinonychus]] that dwelled within [[Jahaka Anchorage]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

Knuckles' moniker referred to what would remain of any hand that may have been used to offer the dinosaur food.

==Relationships==
Knuckles was kept as a guardian by the tavern owner [[Bosco Daggerhand]], by means of a ''[[ring of animal influence]]''.
