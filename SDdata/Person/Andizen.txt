King '''Andizen''' was a king of [[Solon]] during the Solonese Empire.

==Personality==
He was seen as cruel.

==History==
Under King Andizen's rule, the empire had become ever more corrupt and decadent, and the king was very unpopular. He had sent one of his nobles, Lord [[Yseldre]], to the southern marches to combat the depredations of the [[blue dragon]] [[Sturykkazynarr]] at the most dangerous frontier of the realm. After the blue wyrm slew Lord Yseldre, the Lord's daughter, [[Tiphera tir-Yseldre]], challenged the wyrm's forces; over ten years, she became successful and popular enough to endanger King Andizen's rule. In response, Andizen made a deal with the dragon, delivering Tiphera into an ambush under the pretense of celebrating her actions.

===Legacy===
After Tiphera slew Sturykazzynar, King Andizen honored her as a hero, and had her remains and helmet interred in a lavish tomb, [[Tiphera's mausoleum]].

==Rumors & Legends==
By {{yearlink|1372}}, the specifics of his actions became ever more obscure; almost none knew that the mausoleum had been his idea, or that he betrayed Tiphera. He was more known for his jealousy of her fame, and especially for sending her father to guard the dangerous frontier.
