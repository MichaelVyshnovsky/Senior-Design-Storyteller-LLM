She shared some of what she learned with Elminster, and he figured that she returned time and again to Turmish simply because she had fallen in love with the place.\n\nShe published a biography in the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, titled ''[[Memoirs of an Illithid-Human Crossbreed]]''. Elminster assumed she wasn't really an [[illithid]]-human crossbreed but had just picked the title to shock the jaded yet sizeable [[Calishite]] readership, but he said he would find her and ask her some time."
