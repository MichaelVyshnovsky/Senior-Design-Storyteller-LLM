        "mainbody": "rodel was a great wyrm crystal dragon and a thane of the gem dragon god Sardior.\nHrodel possessed all the common powers of crystal dragons and was a master of psionics, focusing on telepathy. In particular, she knew the powers empathy and invisibility and all the psionic attacks (mind thrust, ego whip, id insinuation, psychic crush, mind blast) and defenses (empty mind, thought shield, mental barrier, intellect fortress, tower of iron will).\nAs a thane, Hrodel had a continuous mental contact with Sardior and could be used for his remote viewing, though she could choose to block it.\nHrodel and the other thanes normally resided within Sardiors Ruby Palace as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the material plane alone. Creatures that earned her favor might be rewarded with gems, or sometimes some other gift or favor. She represented a certain facet of Sardiors personality.\nOn worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Hrodel. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Hrodel was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted psions specializing in telepathy. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. There was also a library dedicated to Hrodel its hallowed halls held much information on gem dragons, such as the Draconum Psionicus.\nHrodel served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the amethyst dragon Aleithilithos, the emerald dragon Smargad, the sapphire dragon Charisma, the topaz dragon Tithonnas, and the destroyed obsidian dragon Seradess.\nSome time in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Toril time, scholars and followers of Sardior searched the library of Hrodel for lore on a unique three-headed gem dragon. Theyd learned of after an expedition discovered the journal of a defender of Sardior, Theo Boranis, whod been lost in a cave-in some three centuries prior. The dragon hed seen slumbering was Blithen the Outcast, Sardiors banished advisor."
