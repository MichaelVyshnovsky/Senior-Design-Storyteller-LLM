        "mainbody": "'''Hrodel''' was a [[dragon aging|great wyrm]] [[crystal dragon]] and a thane of the [[gem dragon]] [[god]] [[Sardior]].{{Cite dragon/37/That's not in the Monster Manual!|7,35,36}}{{Cite web/The Legend of Sardior}}",
        "Abilities": "Hrodel possessed all the common powers of crystal dragons and was a master of [[psionics]], focusing on [[telepathy]]. In particular, she knew the powers ''[[empathy (psionic)|empathy]]'' and ''[[invisibility (psionic)|invisibility]]'' and all the psionic attacks (''[[mind thrust]]'', ''[[ego whip]]'', ''[[id insinuation]]'', ''[[psychic crush]]'', ''[[mind blast]]'') and defenses (''[[empty mind]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[intellect fortress]]'', ''[[tower of iron will]]'').\n\nAs a thane, Hrodel had a continuous mental contact with Sardior and could be used for his remote viewing, though she could choose to block it.",
        "Activities": "Hrodel and the other thanes normally resided within Sardior's [[Ruby Palace]] as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the [[material plane]] alone. Creatures that earned her favor might be rewarded with [[gem]]s, or sometimes some other gift or favor. She represented a certain facet of Sardior's personality.\n\nOn worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Hrodel. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Hrodel was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted [[psion]]s specializing in telepathy. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities.{{Cite web/The Church of Sardior}} There was also a library dedicated to Hrodel; its hallowed halls held much information on gem dragons, such as the ''Draconum Psionicus''.{{Cite web/Draconum Psionicus}}",
        "Relationships": "Hrodel served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the [[amethyst dragon]] [[Aleithilithos]], the [[emerald dragon]] [[Smargad]], the [[sapphire dragon]] [[Charisma]], the [[topaz dragon]] [[Tithonnas]], and the destroyed [[obsidian dragon]] [[Seradess]].",
        "History": "Some time in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Toril]] time, scholars and followers of Sardior searched the library of Hrodel for lore on a unique three-headed gem dragon. They'd learned of after an expedition discovered the journal of a defender of Sardior, Theo Boranis, who'd been lost in a cave-in some three centuries prior. The dragon he'd seen slumbering was Blithen the Outcast, Sardior's banished advisor."
