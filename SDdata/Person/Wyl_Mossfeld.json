        "mainbody": "'''Wyl Mossfeld''' was a [[human]] of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "He was a brother of [[Ward Mossfeld|Ward]] and [[Webb Mossfeld]].",
        "Activities": "Wyl, like his brothers, was a member of the West Harbor militia.",
        "History": "Wyl was the bully of West Harbor, who would tease the [[Kalach-Cha]], [[Bevil Starling]] and [[Amie Fern]]. They were the champions of the Harvest Fair for several years.\n\nDuring the Harvest Fair in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Wyl and his brothers competed in the Harvest Brawl. The Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil, after defeating the [[Lannon siblings]], would've faced Wyl, Ward, and Webb. If the Kalach-Cha, Amie, and Bevil were defeated, they could've asked [[Merring]] for a rematch or acknowledged that the Mossfelds had won.\n\nIn the subsequent attack on West Harbor by [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]], the Mossfields aided in the defense, but Wyl was injured. The Kalach-Cha, Bevil, and Amie may have encountered Wyl, who would ask for help, and either healed him (through magic or getting Merring's [[herb]]s) to get him back into the fight or simply slew him due to \"his wounds being too thick to be healed\".\n\nWhen the Kalach-Cha and companions later returned to the village to reassemble the ''[[Sword of Gith]]'', they encountered Wyl and his brothers. However, it was an ambush, as they had been slain and transformed into [[shadow]]s."
