        "mainbody": "'''Mauzzkyl Jaezred''' was a [[drow-dragon]] (''draa'zekyl'') and the patron grandfather of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] as well as its founder.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}",
        "Description": "Mauzzkyl preferred to use his [[drow]] form, appearing as hale old man with broad shoulders, a wide chest, and thinning hair forming a widow's peak.",
        "Personality": "Mauzzkyl at his core was a rebel, who couldnâ€™t tolerate any person, organization, or even deity who would claim power over him. This part of his personality showed in his hatred for his [[shadow dragon]] ancestors, who enslaved him and his people until [[634 DR]],{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|2}} and in his hatred towards [[Lolth]], and also his refusal to turn the Jaezred Chaulssin into a private army of assassins of the [[church of Vhaeraun]].\n\nAs a leader of the Jaezred Chaulssin, he nevertheless gave reverence to [[Vhaeraun]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|5}} While he did refer to the deity as his master and also seemed to put some value in Vhaeraun's favor, he was not completely devoted to the god.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|5}}",
        "History": "He was born in the {{yearlinkName|27}}.\n\nMauzzkyl was the driving force behind the Jaezred's assaults on drow cities during the [[Silence of Lolth]]. He supported [[Nimor Imphraezl]]'s plan and also defended him in front of the other Patron Fathers, who criticized his plan for being too risky to succeed. He was also very pleased with the success of [[Zammzt Everharn]] on [[Ched Nasad]], valuing the importance of breaking the [[church of Lolth]]'s power higher than the semi-total destruction of that city.\n\nAt the end of the Silence, he was unhappy with Nimor's failure in [[Menzoberranzan]] and agreed with his demotion from the position of anointed blade.",
        "Abilities": "Mauzzkyl was a fully developed drow-dragon in his case in the skills of both [[assassin]] and [[sorcerer]]."
