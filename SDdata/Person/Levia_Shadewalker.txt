Levia Shadewalker was the half-elf spymistress of the Eye of Justice in Westgate in the late 15 century DR.
Levia was Gedrin Thalavars apprentice and she considered herself his adopted daughter.
Levia had slightly pointed ears due to her elven heritage. She wasnt pretty, a fact she was painfully aware of.
Levia owned a magical ring that slowed time. She wore brigandine armor and wielded a mace.
In the , Kalen Dren journeyed to Westgate and revealed to the Eye of Justice that he was the heir to the blade Vindicator, Gedrins sword that was once wielded by the god Helm. Kalen became Levias apprentice and she trained him in spycraft and martial skills.
In the , Rhetegast Hawkwinter, the heir to the Shadowbane title, journeyed to Westgate to train with Levia. She groomed him to be the new Shadowbane and he crusaded throughout the city. Later that year, Kalen showed up in Westgate, looking for Rhett but Levia didnt reveal Rhetts whereabouts. When Levia learned that Ilira Nathalan was living in Westgate, she ambushed Ilira in an attempt to bring her to justice for the crimes she supposedly committed, though Ilira escaped.
