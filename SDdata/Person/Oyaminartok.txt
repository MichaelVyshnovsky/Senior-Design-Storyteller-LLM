Oyaminartok () was a goliath werebear that was skilled at fishing.
Oyaminartoks werebear form represented a humanoid polar bear, though her huge arms almost reached her feet. The werebears hair was styled into thick braids and decorated with metal beads. She wore furs and a murky green garb that was fastened by a leather belt.
Though she had a fearsome look to some, Oyaminartok was rather kind, and willing to help adventurers.
She carried a fishing rod, as well as a lot of fishing tackle and the fish she had caught (particularly knucklehead trout).
