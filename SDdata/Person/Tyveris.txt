'''Tyveris''' was a [[loremaster]] of [[Oghma]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was also part of the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]].

==Description==
His skin was a dark coppery color, he had black eyes and used a pair of gold wire spectacles. He had a low booming voice, he stood 6 feet tall and took considerably more space than Caledan. He had monumental shoulders, thickly muscled arms and chest, and wore a brown robe.

==Personality==
Tyveris was calm and gentle.

==Abilities==
He could cast some spells.

==History==
Tyveris was originally from [[Chult]]. Merchants from [[Waterdeep]] came to Chult often hired young [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] who would come with them and become mercenaries. He and his sister, Tali, went with a group of merchants and left Chult behind. Half the Tabaxi hired by the merchants died of sickness on the voyage to the [[Sword Coast]], including Tyveris's sister. Tyveris vowed to take up the sword and become the greatest warrior and make his sister proud.

Tyveris and the other Chultans were enslaved by a [[Calimshite]] wizard for many years. The [[Harpers]]—and [[Caledan Caldorien]]—managed to free them from the wizard. That was when he joined the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]].

After the Fellowship disbanded, Tyveris found that he was following the ideals of Caledan, he realized that he did not enjoy killing, he needed to find his own purpose, and gave up the sword in [[1357 DR]]. That is when he found the [[Abbey of Everard]]. The Loremasters of Oghma allowed Tyveris to work for them. Abbess Melisende taught him how to read. In [[1358 DR]] he joined the order and became a loremaster.

After freeing [[Iriaebor]] of [[Ravendas]]'s rule in [[1363 DR]], Tyveris worked as an advisor to Lord [[Bron]] in reestablishing the city.
