}}The '''Unspeakable''', or '''He Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken''', was a [[Yak-folk|yak-man]] who possessed the body of [[Mu'izzi al-Kamar]], in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|50-51}}

Other yikarians referred to him as "Revered Master," which is their term for a High Priest.

==Activities==
The emperor of the yikarians tasked the Unspeakable with gaining ultimate control of the [[Court of Enlightenment]].

The Unspeakable first encountered Mu'izzi al-Kamar during the 1340s [[DR]] when some of his [[earthservant]]s grabbed him after a sandstorm struck his caravan. After entering his mind and realizing that Mu'izzi was the head of one of the richest merchant families in [[Huzuz]], the Unspeakable instantly recognized the opportunity to wreak havoc upon the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] by possessing Mu'izzi's body. Within a year of his "return" to Huzuz in Mu'izzi's body, the Unspeakable had utterly ''[[charm]]ed'' every member of the [[House of Al-Kamari]] to protect his disguise.

The Unspeakable's first task to harm the Grand Caliph was to ensure he never fathered an heir. He accomplished this feat by forcing [[Suha]], his [[noble dao]] slave, to bury magical amulets within the masonry of each room of the [[Royal Harim of Huzuz|royal harim]]. The amulets were protected against magical detection. They prevented male conception by any female within every room of the harim.

==Possessions==
The Unspeakable wore a ''[[Ring of protection|ring of protection +2]]'', wielded a ''[[staff of the sands]]'', and always carried ''[[potion of human control|potions of human control]]''.
