The Unspeakable, or He Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken, was a yak-man who possessed the body of Muizzi al-Kamar, in 1367 DR.
Other yikarians referred to him as "Revered Master," which is their term for a High Priest.
The emperor of the yikarians tasked the Unspeakable with gaining ultimate control of the Court of Enlightenment.
The Unspeakable first encountered Muizzi al-Kamar during the 1340s DR when some of his earthservants grabbed him after a sandstorm struck his caravan. After entering his mind and realizing that Muizzi was the head of one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz, the Unspeakable instantly recognized the opportunity to wreak havoc upon the Grand Caliph by possessing Muizzis body. Within a year of his "return" to Huzuz in Muizzis body, the Unspeakable had utterly charmed every member of the House of Al-Kamari to protect his disguise.
The Unspeakables first task to harm the Grand Caliph was to ensure he never fathered an heir. He accomplished this feat by forcing Suha, his noble dao slave, to bury magical amulets within the masonry of each room of the royal harim. The amulets were protected against magical detection. They prevented male conception by any female within every room of the harim.
The Unspeakable wore a ring of protection +2, wielded a staff of the sands, and always carried potions of human control.
