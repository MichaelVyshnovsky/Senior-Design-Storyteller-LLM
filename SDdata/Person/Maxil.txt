'''Maxil''' was a member of the [[Adventurer's Guild (Crossroad Keep)|Adventurer's Guild]] of the [[Crossroad Keep]] and one of [[Daerred]]'s adventuring companions in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Maxil was a [[cleric]] who wore [[robe]]s of his faith. His brown hair was cut in a shape of a bowl and facial hair â€“ braided and well-groomed.

==History==
Maxil and his companions claimed to had trained in the art of adventuring under the illustrious Knight-Captain, also known as the [[Kalach-Cha]]. When the troupe leader, [[bard]] Daerred, was granted permission to open his guild in the [[Neverwintran]]-controlled fortress of the Crossroad Keep, the dwarf joined as one of the guild's trainers. Together, they dreamed of opening the greatest adventuring school on the [[Sword Coast]], passing along all things they learned from the Knight-Captain to the next generation of heroes. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Maxil could be found in the Adventurer's Guildhall.
