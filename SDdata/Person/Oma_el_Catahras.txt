'''Oma yr Raisa el Catahras''' was the daughter of the innkeeper of [[The Roving Rune]] in [[Teshburl]] and an aspiring spellcaster and adventuress.

==Activities==
In [[1370 DR]], Oma was being trained by her [[Raisa el Catahras|mother]] in the magical arts in the hidden basement of her [[Atiq el Catahras|father's]] inn. Oma kept her arcane talents secret, but she longed to finish her schooling so she could explore the world as an adventuress.
