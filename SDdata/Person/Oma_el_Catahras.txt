Oma yr Raisa el Catahras was the daughter of the innkeeper of The Roving Rune in Teshburl and an aspiring spellcaster and adventuress.
In 1370 DR, Oma was being trained by her mother in the magical arts in the hidden basement of her fathers inn. Oma kept her arcane talents secret, but she longed to finish her schooling so she could explore the world as an adventuress.
