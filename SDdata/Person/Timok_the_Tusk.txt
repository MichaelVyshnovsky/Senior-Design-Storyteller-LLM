Timok the Tusk was an ambitious half-orc bandit operating in northern Amn in the late 14 century DR.
Timok assembled a group of bandits who hid in the abandoned mining town of Orlsfall in 1370 DR. From this position in the Ridge, they raided north into the Greenfields and robbed travelers there. Timoks gang was successful enough to grow in numbers, and threatened to be noticed by the professional army garrison of nearby Citadel Rashturl.
