Rellamyn was an adventurer of northwest Faerûn in the mid–14th century DR.
He was one of Kyriani Agrivars beaus in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. She teased he had "left a string of broken hearts" from Waterdeep to the Moonsea.
One night during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Kyriani escaped Castle Waterdeep by jumping out of the wall and over the cliff, but had arranged to be rescued by Rellamyn. Riding on the flying horses known as asperii, Rellamyn caught Kyriani in mid-air. He and his two companions dodged flaming arrows over the castle, and returned Kyriani to the Selûnes Smile inn, parting with a passionate kiss.
Kyriani joked that he was "an unreliable, fly-by-night northern barbarian". Nevertheless, she trusted he would be there to catch her.
