'''Rellamyn''' was an adventurer of [[northwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14th{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
He was one of [[Kyriani Agrivar]]'s beaus in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]]. She teased he had "left a string of broken hearts" from [[Waterdeep]] to the [[Moonsea]].

==History==
One night during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Kyriani escaped [[Castle Waterdeep]] by jumping out of the wall and over the cliff, but had arranged to be rescued by Rellamyn. Riding on the flying horses known as [[asperii]], Rellamyn caught Kyriani in mid-air. He and his two companions dodged flaming arrows over the castle, and returned Kyriani to the [[Selûne's Smile]] inn, parting with a passionate kiss.

==Personality==
Kyriani joked that he was "an unreliable, fly-by-night northern barbarian". Nevertheless, she trusted he would be there to catch her.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|21-23}}
