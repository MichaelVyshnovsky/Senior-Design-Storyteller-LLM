        "mainbody": "'''Don Di'Armos de La Sunya''' was the patriarch of the noble [[Athkatla]]n family – [[House de La Sunya]], who served [[Helm]] the Vigilant God.",
        "History": "Don Di'Armos fathered one legitimate son, [[aasimar]] [[Sirge de La Sunya]] who grew up to revere Helm, becoming a [[paladin]] of the faith. Don was on his death bed sometime shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}. The Watcher of Helm revealed to Sirge with his dying breath that he was not the only child. At some point, many years in the past, Don Di'Armos de La Sunya helmed a long and lonely expedition to the land of [[Damara]]. There, the Helmite noble met a mysterious woman in the cold wilderness. The couple became close, and eventually, the strange woman gave birth to a baby girl. The mother revealed herself to be a [[demon]] in childbirth, and Don Di'Armos destroyed the creature. However, he could not kill his daughter, even though she was demon spawn. Don left the child in the care of the monks of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]]. The demon child grew up to become a monk herself – a [[tiefling]] named [[Naleen]].\n\nThis revelation broke Sirge de La Sunya's heart, and soon after his father's death, the paladin left House de La Sunya and the city of Athkatla in search of his long-lost sister."
