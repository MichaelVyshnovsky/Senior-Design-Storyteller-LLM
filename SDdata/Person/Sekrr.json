        "mainbody": "ekrr was a male beholder who laired in Vournoths Mire.\nSekrr looked much like most beholders with ten writhing eye stalks atop his orb-like body. He had bright blue eyes and rich, maroon-coloured hide, though a number of his teeth were missing from his bottom jaw.\nConsidering himself to be a creative and artistic example of his kind, Sekrr liked to craft sculptures of the creatures he petrified with his eye rays.\nBy 1372 DR, Sekrr had made Vournoths Mire his home along with a mind flayer called Quthnorak. Though they usually left each other to their own devices, on occasion they would work together on some project or to defend their joint lair.\nDuring the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, when the nearby city of Maerimydra was destroyed by the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn, a number of drow refugees made their way through Vournoths Mire. Sekrr managed to catch the rear of their party and killed at least three of the drow with his eye rays before coming away with three charmed drow thralls.   \nCategoryBeholders\nCategoryInhabitants of Vournoths Mire\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Middledark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\ns028ehyvz1tljb6me5anidcr3v8dvg1"
