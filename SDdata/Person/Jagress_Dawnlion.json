        "mainbody": "'''Jagress Dawnlion''' was a [[human]] [[Lathander]]ite [[priest]] that lived and died in southern [[Unther]] sometime before the [[Spellplague]] devastated the region.{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|15}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Unther\">It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, owing to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther.",
        "History": "Jagress was buried wearing white [[robe]]s, in a stone [[sarcophagus]] with their name etched into the lid, within the mausoleum of a burial site. Their sarcophagus was designed with a false bottom to hide their belongings within it, which included a number of [[gold piece]]s, a ''+1 [[amulet of mental resolve|amulet of mental resolution]]'', and a ''+1 [[symbol of turning]]''.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], when the surrounding area was part of what was known as [[Tymanther]], the mausoleum where Jagress rested was desecrated by a human [[necromancer]] and later a member of the [[Gem Assayers Union]] named [[Melnar]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|4-5}} The former took Jagress's skull and enchanted it with ''[[Skull Watch]]'' to watch over the mausoleum. Later, a group of [[adventurer]]s sent by [[Dirnth]] of the Gem Assayers Union to find Melnar would inspect Jagress's sarcophagus, finding their body had long since been destroyed but discovering the hidden compartment."
