'''Sfena''' was a powerful [[tiefling]] and the founder and leader of the [[Iron Throne]] but also the daughter of [[Glasya]].

==History==
Sfena was a unique [[baatezu]] born from [[Glasya]] and a unknown father, and so the granddaughter of [[Asmodeus]];
Sfena was trained as assassin in [[Baator]], working for her mother who kept a tight rein on her movements and prevented her from advancing in the baatezu hierarchy. However, in [[1347 DR]], during a mission on [[Faerûn]], a strange incident occurred when she was captured by [[storm giant]]s: her body transformed into a hard crystalline substance, which had the effect of removing her connection to Baator, allowing her to stay in the [[Material Plane]]. Sfena decided to create the Iron Throne as method to cure herself: her plan was to construct a powerful organization and trade it to a powerful [[devil]] in exchange for a cure.

The first part of Sfena's plan worked very well and soon, thanks to her plots the Iron Throne gained a position of prominence. However, her traitorous Iron Throne lieutenant [[Maready]] informed Sfena's parent of her location and in [[1371]] Sfena was forcibly brought back to Baator.<ref>
