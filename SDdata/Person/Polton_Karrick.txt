'''Polton Karrick''' was a painter of some social standing from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Lady Jannath]] was one of the patrons of Polton's. She purchased at least one painting from the artist – a still life picture, that Polton was failing to deliver on time. Some time later the same year, Polton Karrick was invited to attend the art show titled "Strange Tides: Self-Portraits from the [[Sword Coast]]," hosted by Lady Jannath in her [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] estate. However, the lady's butler–[[Tarhun Mnemonis]], was instructed to gently reminder the artist of the delay.
