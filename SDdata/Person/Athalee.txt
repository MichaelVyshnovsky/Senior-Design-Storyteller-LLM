'''Athalee''' was an [[elf]] living in [[Kryptgarden Forest]] in past ages.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|40}}

==History== 
Athalee was in a forgotten past a scholar who lived and died in Kryptgarden.

In [[1489 DR]], the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] [[necromancer]] [[Zaralda]] raised him as an [[undead]] like many others.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|41}} However, he was able to resist the compelling orders of the necromancer. Hating his new condition, Athalee attacked Zaralda and her allies, hoping to die with his tormentor.

In the end, after an attack in which he killed many cultists and [[Thay]]ans, an adventuring party hired to defeat [[Claugiyliamatar]] assaulted Zaralda and her minions.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|41}}
