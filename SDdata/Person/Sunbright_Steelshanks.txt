'''Sunbright Steelshanks''' was a [[Rengarth]] [[barbarian]] of ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}}, who caught the eye of the [[Netherese]] [[wizard]]s [[Candlemas]] and [[Sysquemalyn]].

==Description==
The blond-haired barbarian was slender and quick with corded muscles. With his bright hair and strong legs, the barbarian was given the name of Sunbright Steelshanks by his mother [[Monkberry]] on his nameday.

==Possessions==
When traveling, Sunbright dressed in a worn [[linen]] shirt, [[wikipedia:leather|leather]] and [[iron]]-studded boots, and a brown goatskin [[wikipedia:en:Jerkin (garment)|jerkin]]. Over his shoulders, he wore a [[longbow]], a [[bedroll]], and his [[sword]], which was called [[Harvester of Blood]].

==History==
During the [[Shadowed Age]],, Steelshanks was born to [[Monkberry]] and [[Sevenhaunt]]. For many years, Sunbright lived with his parents in the Rengarth tribe called the [[Raven Tribe|Ravens]] until his father took ill and died.

''Circa'' −700 DR, Sunbright killed his first [[Angardt]] enemy and was granted his father's [[greatsword]], Harvester of Blood, by his mother. Envious, the Raven [[shaman]] [[Owldark]] prophesied Steelshanks would murder his people, so Sunbright fled in the night with the help of his mother.

A year later, the young [[fighter]] encountered a group of [[orc]]s within the [[Barren Mountains]] while being observed by the Netherese wizards Candlemas and Sysquemalyn.
