Gadalult Mitheir, referred to by some with the nickname Old Leatherjaws, was a priest of Gond who tended to the religious community in Yeshpek in the late 14 century DR.
Gadalult was a master of smithwork for small and delicate things. In his old age, he often made replacement parts for the insides of locks and other similar exacting items.
For much of his life Gadalult lived as a warrior. By the time he retired he had become a priest of Master rank within the Church of Gond and settled in Yeshpek to oversee the temple of Bright Anvil.
