'''Prugdush Glurp''' was the blacksmith owner of [[Prugdush's World of Weapons]] in [[Spindrift Town]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Prugdush was a tall and surprisingly muscular humanoid, of otherwise typical appearance for a sahuagin. He did not seem to be bothered by the sweltering heat of his forge.

==Personality==
Prugdush Glurp had trouble differentiating warm-blooded humanoids from one another, calling them "soft-skins" and used his sense of smell as a reliable tool in dealing with land-dwellers.

The sahuagin blacksmith often joked about eating his customers, but in reality, it was explicitly forbidden for him to do by the priestesses of [[Umberlee]] in Spindrift Town. Prugdush was quite friendly otherwise.

==Abilities==
Prugdush Glurp was a blacksmith who created and sold a wide variety of armors and weapons. He also offered armor upgrades. His blacksmiths single-handedly outfitted the town's pirate fleet.
