Jenks was a street urchin from Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
Jenks had a somewhat stocky build. Like most Turami, he had dark skin. His hair was a darker shade of brown than his skin, and was cut almost down to the roots.
Despite being shy around strangers, Jenks was brave and fiercely defended his friends.
He wore a robe and carried a toy wand and a stuffed owlbear, which he called his "familiar".

Jenks was part of the group of street urchins that included his friends Nat and Squiddly. Since Nat was deaf, Jenks and Squiddly communicated with her using a sign language Nat had invented.
In the late 15 century DR, Jenks and his friends were unwittingly entangled in the city-wide hunt for the Stone of Golorr, sometimes innocently helping or hindering the efforts of adventurers in retrieving it.
