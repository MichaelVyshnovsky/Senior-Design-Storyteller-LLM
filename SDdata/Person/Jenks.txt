'''Jenks''' was a street urchin from [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Jenks had a somewhat stocky build. Like most Turami, he had dark skin. His hair was a darker shade of brown than his skin, and was cut almost down to the roots.

==Personality==
Despite being shy around strangers, Jenks was brave and fiercely defended his friends.

==Possessions==
He wore a robe and carried a toy [[wand]] and a stuffed [[owlbear]], which he called his "[[familiar]]".

==Relationships==
[[File:Jenks_portrait.webp|thumb|right|''A closeup of Jenks' likeness.'']]
Jenks was part of the group of street urchins that included his friends [[Nat]] and [[Squiddly]]. Since Nat was [[deaf]], Jenks and Squiddly communicated with her using a sign language Nat had invented.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Jenks and his friends were unwittingly entangled in the city-wide hunt for the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', sometimes innocently helping or hindering the efforts of adventurers in retrieving it.
