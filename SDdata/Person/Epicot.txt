'''Epicot''' was a renowned [[wizard]] from [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] .

==Abilities==
Epicot was a powerful arcane spellcaster whose ''[[spellbook]]'' was chock-filled with spells.

==Possessions==
The wizard resided in his lone {{SIAdj|30'|'"|long=yes|adj=tall}} [[Epicot's Tower|tower]] in the city of Arabel. He stored his magical tools in the spellcasting chamber on the tower's top floor. His [[spellbook]] had 35 spells, and his ''[[wand of wonder]]'' was always charged to the maximum capacity. He kept a detailed personal journal.

==Relationships==
Epicot had a close relationship with a widowed baker who lived a block away. [[Maggie Rollins]] regularly sent her son [[Michael Rollins|Little Michael]] to the wizard's tower with a basket of fresh [[honeyed bun]]s. Epicot thought the woman was trying to show her affections, but the wizard was unwilling to reciprocate. In turn, Epicot thought the child to be a bright young man and hoped to have Michael as his apprentice one day.

==History==
On the [[Flamerule 19|19{{th}} of Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Epicot became alarmed by three nights of heavy thunderstorms in a row, something that hadn't happened in over 90 years. The same day, Little Michael informed Epicot of a strange-looking bearded man asking the child about the wizard's daily schedule. The stranger clad in green offered Michael a [[honey]]comb in exchange for information. This sparked Epicot's suspicions, and he warded the door of his tower with a ''[[fire trap]]'' spell. The following day, the [[Flamerule 20|20{{th}} of Flamerule]], he received a shipment of [[frog]]s for magical experiments. The green-garbed man was seen around the tower several times that day. The mysterious man was [[Brokus]] of the [[Night Parade]].

The Night Parade was working to open a ''[[gate]]'' to launch an invasion into Arabel, and they tracked down and assassinated powerful wizards who could pose a problem for the plot. Epicot's demise came on the night of Flamerule 20{{th}}. He was murdered by Brokus and [[Zupar]], who turned a wall of the wizard's tower into water and swiftly decapitated him. The Night Parade took the head away to ensure there would be no ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'', and carved the symbol of [[Zhentarim]] on his chest to blame another faction. The following morning citizens of Arabel noticed a wall missing in Epicot's tower and informed the city guards. His headless body was buried on the [[Flamerule 21|21{{st}} of Flamerule]].

After his death, Epicot's kin rewarded the wizard's [[magical item]]s to the heroes tasked by the Lady Lord of Arabel with investigating the wizard murders.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|43}}
