When he was young, he was a witness to the argument between Coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] and Lady [[Ildilyntra Starym]] before she attempted to kill him, though he kept the secret close to his chest.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Starsunder was at [[Tangletrees]], where he met the mage [[Umbregard]] of [[Galadorna]]. Umbregard was looking for guidance related to [[Elminster Aumar]], who was both the last court mage of his land and a [[Chosen of Mystra]]. The grove sacred to [[Rillifane Rallathil]] and [[Sehanine Moonbow]] judged Umbregard sincere, and Starsunder spoke freely with him. He later took Umbregard to the [[Lookout Tree]], where he explained the tasks before Elminster, and also the risk that Elminster's temptations became suffering for someone else. Afterwards, he took him across the sea to the forest near [[Starmantle]], at [[the Dead Place]], where fires had been used in disregard of the safety of the woods.\n\nIn the forest, they met with a number of [[Shar]]ran [[Dreadspell]]s, who attacked them. Though Umbregard and Starsunder fought, they only prevailed at great cost, with Umbregard injured, and thanks to the timely intervention of [[Tenthar Taerhamoos]], a foe of his guest. Both Starsunder and Umbregard tried to heal Starsunder afterwards.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|750-751|20}}"
