Jessa Vai was a officer within the Flaming Fist of Baldurs Gate during the mid-14 century DR. For a brief time, she was assigned stationed in the town of Beregost.
In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Officer Vai was assigned to Beregost to deal with the bandits that were assaulting caravans and travelers along the Trade Way. She paid a 50 gp bounty for every bandit scalp that was brought to her during her stay. Vai specifically recruited Gorions Ward to assist her with this endeavour.
Once the bandits were considered to have been dealt with, she returned to her superiors in Baldurs Gate and delivered her report on the situation.
