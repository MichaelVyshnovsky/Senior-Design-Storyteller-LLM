'''Valmiki''' was a poet in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Valmiki was a mediocre poet, that usually copied her poems from more famous artists. She hoped that the company of an adventuring group would help her creativity.

She lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford on [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] near the barracks.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
