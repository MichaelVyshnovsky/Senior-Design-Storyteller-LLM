Valmiki was a poet in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Valmiki was a mediocre poet, that usually copied her poems from more famous artists. She hoped that the company of an adventuring group would help her creativity.
She lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford on Wall Street near the barracks.
