{{quote|''Punishment is far too convenient an excuse for the things men do to one another. But I would see that the people who took my poor Jithelle from me never have the opportunity to make anyone else hurt the way I do right now.''|Nimra Skolotti to [[Vambran Matrell]]}}

==Description==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Nimra was an old woman who had lost her eyesight sometimes in the past. She was known to all as a sweet and kind soul. Despite her age, Nimra had a keen sense of hearing.

==Activities==
Nimra and her two daughters lived in the Living District of Arrabar, the poorer area to the city's east. The woman lived in a humble apartment atop a rug merchant's store.

The old blind woman and her daughters often started their morning by visiting a local bakery and buying a single small [[honeyed bun]] to share. They headed to the market to pick up fresh produce following the light breakfast.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Nimra's older daughter, Jithelle, worked as a servant at the noble [[House Pharaboldi]]. The young woman was seduced and bedded by the family's youngest offspring, [[Denrick Pharaboldi]]. Jithelle fell for the man and thought that he cared for her. When the young servant became pregnant with Pharaboldi bastard, she thought that her child would be able to get a better life through the noble father. However, that was not to be. Denrick Pharaboldi was a cruel and selfish man, just like his mother, [[Anista Pharaboldi]]. They ordered the young servant to be murdered in order for her not in interfered with an arranged political marriage into the [[Matrell]] clan of Arrabar.

Jithelle was killed under the pretense of her claiming to be an arcane spellcaster, and she was murdered alongside a fellow servant â€“ [[Hoytir]], to explain the pregnancy. Nimra was devastated by the loss of her oldest child. She knew of the bastard child, as Jithelle shared the happy news with their family. Also, Nimra knew that the claims of the imposter crime were a lie as the young woman could not even read. A day after the grave news reached Nimra and Mirolyn, the women were contacted by [[Vambran Matrell]], who knew the girl's death was unjust, and he sought justice.

Several weeks later, after the justice was served to the young woman's murderers, the Skolotti family was offered a new home. [[Hetta Matrell]], the matriarch of the House Matrell, feeling guilty over her family's hand in Jithelle's death, invited Nimra and her surviving daughter to relocate to the Matrell estate. The offer was eagerly accepted. Mirolyn offered to help the family with keeping an eye on the young twins [[Obiron Matrell II|Obiron]] and [[Quindy Matrell|Quindy]], while Nimra retired in comfort and surrounded by friendly faces. Sometime later, Nimra and her daughter witnessed an attempt on Hetta Matrell's life that left her spirit bound to a [[ring]], a retaliation for Vambran's actions that brought Jithelle's murderers to justice.
