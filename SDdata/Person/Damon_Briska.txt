'''Damon Briska''' was an individual that lived in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|We're peaceable folk, and we get on with the druids well enough, but I pay no fealty or tax to any far-off city I can't even find on a map.|''Excerpt from [[Regarding Strange Riders in These Parts]].''}}

==Description==
Damon had some amount of [[elven]] blood, as his great-uncle was a [[half-elf]].

==Personality==
Damon was a forthright and outspoken individual who was proud to be a free 'Citizen of the Heartlands'.

==History==
Some time after the nation of [[Elturgard]] was formed, Elturian [[Hellriders]] began riding across the [[Western Heartlands|surrounding lands]], patrolling for dangers that may plague the region. Damon vehemently disagreed with that level of overreach by the military organization. In response, Damon penned ''[[Regarding Strange Riders in These Parts]]'', and posted it in settlements across the lands. The village of [[Moonhaven]] was among those sites.
