'''Kanari Taro''' was a [[korobokuru]] [[yakuza]] adventurer in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Taro lived on the streets from when he was child, never knowing about his family. At one point, he was adopted by a small yakuza gang. However, some years after, in 1357 DR, just after becoming a regular yakuza, Taro killed a yakuza of a rival gang over an offense. For this, he was obligated to become a ''[[matatabi]]'', a wandering yakuza. His [[Wa-an dictionary#O|''oyabun'']] suggested to Taro that he go to Miyama to serve oyabun [[Ebi]].
