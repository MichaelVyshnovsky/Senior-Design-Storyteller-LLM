Kanari Taro was a korobokuru yakuza adventurer in Miyama Province in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Taro lived on the streets from when he was child, never knowing about his family. At one point, he was adopted by a small yakuza gang. However, some years after, in 1357 DR, just after becoming a regular yakuza, Taro killed a yakuza of a rival gang over an offense. For this, he was obligated to become a matatabi, a wandering yakuza. His oyabun suggested to Taro that he go to Miyama to serve oyabun Ebi.
