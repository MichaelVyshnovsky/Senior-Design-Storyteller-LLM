        "mainbody": "'''Sithierel''' was a [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] [[hexblade]] who piloted the ''[[Necreme]]'' in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the early 1370s [[DR]] on behalf of the [[church of Shar]] there.",
        "History": "Serving Kithlord [[Thieraven]], Sithierel was most likely the shadar-kai who led the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]] through the Shadow Swamp to the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]] for a meeting with the priestess of [[Shar]], [[Esvele Graycastle]], in the early 1370s [[DR]].\n\nThereafter, he ferried [[dominate person|duped]] petitioners of the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] over the Shadow Swamp to their ultimate fates.\n\nFinally, in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Sithierel may have been defeated by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating the Sharrans' activities, though he would try to escape and warn his allies.",
        "Activities": "Operating the ''Necreme'' as a ferry over the [[Whispermere]] through the Shadow Swamp, Sithierel's duty was to transport captives from the [[Shadow Citadel]] to the Monastery of the Ebon Dome. The trip took around 10 hours. He made his journey every two days, and rested for a night at the monastery. Along the way, he refilled the beacons that lit the route with [[shadowlight oil]] and restocked on oil at the monastery.",
        "Description": "Like other shadar-kai, Sithierel was tall with black hair and dusky gray skin. He was particularly gaunt of build, even for a shadar-kai. Purple tattoos covered his face and he had [[iron]] piercings in his ears and arms, and he had a rasping voice.",
        "Personality": "He was a dour and surly fellow, as well as suspicious and taciturn, not easily taken in by trickery.",
        "Abilities": "With the powers of a shadar-kai and a hexblade, he was a nimble warrior proficient with the [[spiked chain]].",
        "Relations": "He was aided by the [[dusk beast]] [[Grask]] as a companion and guard dog.",
        "Possessions": "In battle, Sithierel was armed with a ''+1 spiked chain'' and a [[composite shortbow]] with well-made arrows. He wore a ''+1 [[mithral]] [[chain shirt]]'' and a ''[[gal-ralan]]''. He kept a [[potion]] of ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' on his person.\n\nHis largest possession was the ''Necreme'' and its command amulet that he wore.\n\nAboard the ship, he stored his wealth and treasures, including a [[scroll]] of ''[[blur]]''.\n\nHe also owned a fine [[dragonbone lyre]] given to him by Esvele and Thieraven. When he played a certain tune on it, the [[Whispermere guardian|guardian]] at [[Black Tree Bend]] would become subdued."
