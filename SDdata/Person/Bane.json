        "mainbody": "Like many of the younger gods, Bane was once a mortal [[human]]. Little was known about the Black Hand's past, not even precisely when it was he lived, but the [[adventurer]] became known when he forged an alliance with two other mortal beings: [[Bhaal]] and [[Myrkul]]. Together, the three forged a pact of mutual aid and ambition: together they would conquer not just the world, but the heavens, becoming [[god]]s unto themselves. They targeted specifically the powerful god of death, [[Jergal]], who was among the most powerful of [[Toril]]'s deities at the time.\n\n===Divine Ascension===\n[[File:Bane Old Symbol.png|thumb|left|150px|An archaic [[holy symbol]] of Bane, predating the [[Era of Upheaval]]]] \nThe group, known as the [[Dead Three]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|49}} soon became well-known to Jergal, surmounting every obstacle thrown their way. They obtained [[magic]]al power and even destroyed a [[primordial]] in the {{yearlinkName|-357}}. They served as generals to an army comprising forces from three human nations, savage [[gnoll]]s, and other races from the [[Moonsea North]], slaying [[Maram of the Great Spear]] at the [[Monument of the Ancients]] in the [[Frozen Forest]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48-49}} taking the fallen [[primordial]]'s essence, and dividing it up equally amongst themselves. Unbeknown to them, this was all Jergal's doing, for the god had grown tired of his crown,\n\nWhen the time came to confront Jergal, the god of death tricked the Dead Three into turning on one another, each desiring the others' power. Jergal then intervened and proposed to divide up his portfolio for them, based upon a game of [[knucklebones]], which Bane promptly won. Bane claimed for his prize governance over the sphere of strife, believing he would be able to rule over all of Toril in this way. As it turned out, however, Bane would not only have to contend with Bhaal and Myrkul, who became powerful gods in of themselves, but with the rest of the divine, who would become his most hated foes.\n\n===Time of Troubles===\n[[File:Bane symbol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The holy symbol of Bane, during the [[Era of Upheaval]].'']]\n{{main|Time of Troubles}}\nAlthough Bane had many foes, he did find allies in a few gods and in particular continued a working relationship with the other members of the Dead Three, with whom he plotted against his enemies, such as the goddess [[Mystra]]. It was during this time that Bane sired a son, [[Iyachtu Xvim]], some say by a [[tanar'ri]], others by a fallen [[paladin]] of good. Xvim resented his father but nonetheless served compliantly as his servant during this period, along with other servants of the Black Hand such as Bhaal. Iyachtu Xvim's true purpose, however, would not be revealed until many, many years later.\n\nEventually, Bane's plots backfired against him and in one particularly overambitious gambit, he and Myrkul attempted to steal the [[Tablets of Fate]] from [[Ao]] the Overgod himself. For this, the two and every other god were banished from their [[astral dominion]]s to traverse Toril's surface in an exercise of humility, precipitating the [[Time of Troubles]]. It was Ao's hope that through this, the gods would learn not only to be content with what power they had, but to respect the needs and wishes of their worshipers.\n\nHowever, not all the gods were so willing to learn and all of them tried to regain their divine power as quickly as possible. Bane was among these deities, but unfortunately for him he was slain by the young god [[Torm]] on [[Eleasias]] 13, [[1358 DR]] near [[Tantras]]. Subsequently the majority of Bane's power fell from him to the mortal Cyric, who temporarily claimed the powers of all the Dead Three - all of whom perished in the Time of Troubles. A smaller portion fell to his son, Iyachtu Xvim, an eventuality that Bane had anticipated should he himself perish.\n\nWhen news of his destruction spread across the Realms, at least a score of Faerûnian nations marked the occasion with widespread festivals of thanks and celebration.\n\n===Resurrection and return to power===\n[[File:Bane.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Return of Bane]]\n[[File:Bane_symbol_-_Mike_Schely.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bane's talon symbol]]\nFor Bane, it soon became apparent, death was but a temporary setback. Anticipating the possibility of his own death, Bane (like his companion Bhaal) had created a scion for the purpose of his own regeneration. When the time was right Xvim&mdash;who was in fact little more than a cocoon to contain the essence of Bane&mdash;burst open into the black and armored figure of Bane, destroying the younger god entirely. This [[Return of Bane|event]], which occurred on [[Midwinter]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic]], appears to have been in part the work of the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]] as well, who performed a summoning the same night. Overnight the [[Faithful]] of Xvim, led by the god's [[Chosen]] [[Fzoul Chembryl]] converted to the worship of their returned master, as did many of Cyric's own worshipers.\n\nAfter his miraculous resurrection, Bane reestablished his power base, regaining nearly all of his followers from Xvim and Cyric. who had previously worked alongside him before the Time of Troubles.\n\nBane escaped the [[Spellplague]] largely unscathed and, in fact, the cataclysm largely benefited him, removing two of his chief rivals, [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]{{Cite web/Dragon Features Archive|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081219000435/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drfe/20080227a|title=Spellplague: The Wailing Years|author=[[Brian R. James]]|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-04-14}} and [[Cyric]] all at once. In the century that followed Bane's power increased only further and the god conquered the [[goblinoid pantheon]], bringing [[Maglubiyet]] and [[Hruggek]] to heel before him. By the end of the Era of Upheaval Bane was as powerful&mdash;and as dangerous&mdash;as he had ever been.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], following the events of the [[Second Sundering]] when most deities withdrew their direct influence from Toril, Bane along with the returned Myrkul and Bhaal remained behind as [[quasi-deity|quasi-deities]]. Though he was still able to influence events over [[Faerûn]], Bane was essentially trapped in a mortal form.",
        "Description": "When summoned, Bane had a dark and rather shadowy appearance with a resemblance of dark armor and his tell-tale jeweled, dark gauntlet. He emanated an aura of vast power and cruel intelligence.",
        "Personality": "Bane was a wholly malevolent and brutal deity that distanced himself from mere mortals, preferring to reign over his followers from afar. He savored the terror he instilled in others and the hatred that formed in mortals' hearts, utilizing this strife to gain greater control over the Realms.\n\nHe embodied the principles of ambition and control and believed that the strong had not only the right, but the duty, to rule over the weak. He favored those with drive and courage, often aiding those who sought to establish order or conquer new territories. While he was seen as a savior in some regions, his teachings also led to dictatorships and the promotion of slavery.\n\n[[File:SymboIOfBane.png|thumb|left|150px|The Black Hand of Bane]]",
        "Abilities": "When confronted with a potential battle, Bane would possess an individual and force their body to take on a twisted and monstrous form with leathery black skin and powerful claws that could rend flesh and metal alike. He gained any powers they held in their life, and protected his host from [[psionic]] control.",
        "Possessions": "Unlike other deities Bane possessed no divine weapon, rather he favored his own ''[[Black Hand of Bane|gauntleted right hand]]''. He was sometimes accompanied by a [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[raven]] called [[Koravis]].",
        "Divine Realm": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] Bane's [[divine realm]], the [[Black Bastion]], could be found in [[Avalas]], the first layer of [[Acheron]]. or as it was [[World Tree cosmology|previously known]], the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]].",
        "Relationships": "While Bane believed himself the rightful ruler of all the planes and could not tolerate subservience to anyone, \n\nBesides allies, Bane also had servants such as Bhaal and his own son [[Iyachtu Xvim]] during his first life as a god, [[Malar]] was also known to work along with Bane at times.\n\nBane was the former lover of the goddess [[Kiputytto]]. He attempted to steal her divine power during their amorous encounters, but was ultimately unsuccessful.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-07-07/Kiputytto and Bane}}\n\nBut as numerable as his allies, Bane had many enemies as well. For a time, Bane's most hated foe was the goddess of magic, [[Mystra]], whose power he coveted.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Places of Worship": "Although Bane was worshiped all over Faerûn, his presence was strongest in the [[Moonsea]] region, where, as of [[1479 DR]], the [[Church of Bane]] had its headquarters: the [[House of the Black Lord]] in [[Mulmaster]]. During the same time, his Church was the only one allowed in [[Thay]]. Other known temples include:\n\n* [[Black Altar]] – [[Zhentil Keep]]\n* [[Dark God Reformed]] – [[Voonlar]]\n* [[Dark Shrine]] – Zhentil Keep\n* [[Lyceum of the Black Lord]] – [[Phlan]]{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}}\n* [[Temple of Bane (Snowmantle)]] – [[Daggerdale]]"
