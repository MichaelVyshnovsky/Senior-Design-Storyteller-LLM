{{quote|''I only speak the law of the jungle. My children are hungry, your arrival is most fortunate.''|Kutamba the Strange Druid}}

==Description==
Kutamba dressed himself in an assortment of black animal furs.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], Kutamba was a threat to adventurers foolish enough to wander through the jungles of Samarach. He could be seen wandering through the jungles akin a dark sinister shadow confronting outsiders. The druid enforced the law of jungle on his victims - the lady of "eat or be eaten." Kutamba was always accompanied by his "children" â€“ three deadly black [[panther]].
