Laal was a flumph living in the Underdark beneath Mulmaster.
Laal was a polite and truthful creature. She greatly loved her companion Xol and was shocked by his death.
Laal lived with her companion Xol in the Underdark below Earthspur Mountains.
In 1491 DR, Xol noticed a group of troglodytes moving to the sewers of Mulmaster. He convinced Laal to follow them in order to warn others about this menace. While following the troglodytes, Xol singled out the mind of a particularly evil human. Xol tried to follow this man but was killed in an ambush. His body fell into the sewers and ended up being carried to the surface where it was discovered by some children. Laal tried to mentally contact first one of the children and afterwards the adventurer Florio but with little success.
