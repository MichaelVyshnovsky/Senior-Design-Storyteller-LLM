        "mainbody": "'''Thadat''' was a mage that sold [[magical item]]s and services in [[Innarlith]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Description": "He was short and thin.",
        "History": "He was active in Innarlith in the mid–14{{th}} century DR, where he made a name for himself as a creator of [[magic rings]]. He rented out a suite of rooms in an inn in the second quarter of Innarlith, where he lived and which he used also for his business.\n\nOn [[Alturiak 4]], the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, he was confronted at his home in the inn by [[Marek Rymüt]], a [[Red Wizard]] who was disguising himself as a private seller in magical items and services in Innarlith. Thadat deeply distrusted Marek and made it clear to Marek that he refused to join what he called \"your little club\", referring to Marek's attempt to monopolize the trade in magic in Innarlith. During the meeting, a [[Vaasan]] [[mage]] named [[Kurtsson]] appeared behind Thadat, cast a spell of ''[[silence]]'', and murdered Thadat with his axe. Marek pocketed Thadat's clove of garlic before opening a ''[[dimension door]]'' to escape. Kurtsson used an [[illusion]] to transform his appearance and walk out of the inn, to give the impression that someone else had murdered the mage.",
        "Possessions": "He kept a number of items in the suite of an inn he rented in Innarlith. Some of them were useful spell foci, while others were useless and meant to simply give customers the impression that they were for magical use.\n\nHe created a ''[[ring of feather falling]]'' and sold it to [[Wenefir]], a [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]].<ref>\n\nHe wrote a [[Draconic language|Draconic]] poem with powerful [[necromancy|necromantic]] effects on a clove of [[garlic]] that he kept in his room. The text of the poem in Draconic was \"''Dan de dan de dan ne zhee. Chaznur durro shizzlin dul aele asruzhaeldi. Ullian-drol durro klaya aele sheet al leernall. Realnakfloordurro shoke aele aesaldrindur. Lomridnelle verith al almindure fleezhae. Gahn dool aesdnurde quinlek gloesh.''\" (\"One and one and one is three. Tear that trembles up my spine. Pain that turns my cries to screams. Despair that breaks my spirit line. Surrender truth to desperate dreams. Set your soul and body free.\")",
        "Relationships": "He was a competitive rival to Marek Rymüt in the sale of magical services and items. Marek stole Thadat's garlic from him after murdering him and later ingested this garlic years later while performing a spell that would turn Senator [[Willem Korvan]] into his powerful [[undead]] slave. Marek remarked that he thought Thadat never realized what this garlic would do and how powerful it was.<ref>"
