'''Fergus Gunderson''' was an old farmer that lived in [[Rothé Valley Village]] during the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|“That'll teach me to make a bet against a drunken wizard..."}}

==Relationships==
He was believed to have been related to the young woman [[Cella Gunderson]], and her [[Gunderson|uncle]], the village's mayor some 50 years after Fergus' time.

==History==
On one occasion, Fergus made a bet with a traveling wizard named [[Rucksam]], the specifics of which had been lost to time. To win the bet, Rucksam created a tunnel in the valley, linking Fergus' home village with nearby farms. As a result of his loss, Fergus had to pay the wizard's bar tab every time again he visited the town.
