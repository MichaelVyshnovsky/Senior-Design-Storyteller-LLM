Vimu, whose name translated as "Fat Belly," was a saru warrior, adopted and raised by the reformed cannibal Kukalatu tribe of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Vimu was a strong warrior and of the Kukalatu Village. He was a large humanoid, bigger than most Kukalaturi of the tribe.
Vimu swing a large axe in battle and carried a net, used during hunting expeditions. When disarmed, his fists were just as powerful of a weapon.
Some years before the late 14 century DR, very young Vimu and his brother Bubba were rescued by the Kukalatu warriors after their parents were killed by the dreaded leopard katangas. The saru duo were adopted by the tribe and raised as members of the community.
In The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle was sent to the Kukalatu tribe by Chief Katar of the Koshiva to establish contact with the reformed cannibal and return with a special healing potion for the Chiefs wife – Ootoo. A Kukulaturi hunting party was the first contact for the heroes who ran into them not far from the village. Warriors Bifu and eJahi were the ones to meet the group in the open, while others – Gihu, Latu, Bubba and Vimu, stayed hidden, in case the strangers brought trouble.
