'''Vimu''', whose name translated as "Fat Belly," was a [[saru]] [[warrior]], adopted and raised by the reformed cannibal [[Kukalatu]] tribe of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Me hungry. You got food?''|Vimu the Saru}}

==Description==
Vimu was a strong warrior and of the Kukalatu Village. He was a large humanoid, bigger than most Kukalaturi of the tribe.

==Possessions==
Vimu swing a large [[axe]] in battle and carried a [[net]], used during hunting expeditions. When disarmed, his fists were just as powerful of a weapon.

==History==
Some years before the late 14{{th}} century DR, very young Vimu and his brother [[Bubba]] were rescued by the Kukalatu warriors after their parents were killed by the dreaded [[leopard katanga]]s. The saru duo were adopted by the tribe and raised as members of the community.

In The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle was sent to the Kukalatu tribe by Chief [[Katar (Nubari)|Katar]] of the [[Koshiva]] to establish contact with the reformed cannibal and return with a special healing [[potion]] for the Chief's wife – [[Ootoo]]. A Kukulaturi hunting party was the first contact for the heroes who ran into them not far from the village. Warriors [[Bifu]] and [[eJahi]] were the ones to meet the group in the open, while others – [[Gihu]], [[Latu]], Bubba and Vimu, stayed hidden, in case the strangers brought trouble.
