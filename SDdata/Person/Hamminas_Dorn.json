He was considered as a charismatic leader among the citizens of Tarmalune.\nHamminas Dorn was the Lord Speaker of the Council of Tarmalune, the leader of the councilors. Because of his position as Lord Speaker, he was the de facto mayor of the city. He was also the leader of Tarmalunes police force, the Vigilant.\nWhile he was popular among honest traders and citizens who were grateful for his compromises towards law and peace, Hamminas faced a strong opposition among corrupt merchants and other citizens whose interests were thwarted by Hamminass efforts to rout evil from Tarmalune. Among his most fierce opposition was Rathgar Malynd, a mercenary captain who led the Battle Hounds mercenary company.\nBecause of his many detractors, Hamminas had trained many Vigilants who earned his trust to replace him as Lord Speaker if necessary.\nIn his youth, Hamminas was an adventurer. He gained the trust and friendship of powerful and influential merchants from Tarmalune, and when he retired from adventuring they backed up his claim to become the leader of the Council. After that, he founded a police force to protect the city, the Vigilant.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryAdventurers\nCategoryRulers\nCategoryCouncilors\nCategoryInhabitants of Tarmalune\nCategoryInhabitants of the Windrise Ports\nCategoryInhabitants of Laerakond\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nnobhrh1sp59hwkvqed63js1pmzvf5o2"
