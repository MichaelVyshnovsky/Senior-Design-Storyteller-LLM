So the SeSehen destroyed the orthodox Sauringar tribe and took control of the Temple of World Serpent. There, NSafa started a ritual to summon Zehir and started her plot for world domination, sending disguised yuan-ti spies over all Faer√ªn.\nHowever, the surviving Sauringar princess SaSani manipulated the Hero of Neverwinter into ruining the SeSehens plots and at last into attacking the Temple during the last ritual performed by NSafa. The Hero killed NSafa."
