        "Description": "D'shai was a large [[yuan-ti abomination]] with dark-red scale-covered body.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Serpentguard D'shai and several other serpentine abominations were left to guard a long-abandoned temple that once belonged to House Sauringar until they abandoned the worship of Sseth in favor of the interloper deity [[Zehir]]. The temple stood in the heart of the [[Samarlogh]] and hid the divinely [[enchanted]] ''[[Sauringar Tome]]''. In [[1374 DR]], an infamous writer and explorer named [[Volothamp Geddarm]] sought lore to pen ''[[Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms]]'', a book dedicated to [[Samarach]]. He asked a band of adventurers to infiltrate D'shai's temple to retrieve yuan-ti artifacts from its inner sanctum."
