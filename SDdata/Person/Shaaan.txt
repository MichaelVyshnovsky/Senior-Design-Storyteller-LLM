Shaaan the Serpent Queen was a nefarious wizard that once challenged the Sage of Shadowdale, Elminster.
Shaaan appeared as a woman with pure white skin, green eyes, and wild, golden hair tinged with flame-orange. She wore skin-tight clothing and thigh-high boots seemingly made of serpent scales that left much of her skin exposed. Her visage was clearly cold and menacing.
Shaaan was a mysterious woman with scales who once ruled a snake cult in Tashalar. She had fought many times with Elminster.
Once, around 1340 DR, the Company of Crazed Venturers fought Shaaan on a small isle on the Sword Coast, off the coast of Mintarn. They broke her concentration on spellcasting and bid her to stop what she was working on, otherwise theyd destroy it. Then one of their members threatened Shaaan by using the disintegrate spell on a nearby stone. Shaking her head in derision, Shaaan touched ground and disintegrated the entire island, dumping the Company into the ocean as she levitated and continued to work on her spellcasting.
In the , the Zhentarim considered Shaaan, together with Maraunth Torr, Szass Tam, and Larloch, as one of the most powerful evil archmages. 
At last, in an inter-dimensional place where Elminster sometimes met people from other planes, Shaaan appeared and tried to seduce the archmage Dalamar the Black from Krynn, but Elminster, with the help of the archmage Mordenkainen from Oerth, whod also had an encounter with Shaaan, used Ed Greenwood to imprison her in the Floating Helm of Tharados (a unique ancient Netherese magic item).
Shaaan resurfaced around 1487 DR and competed with other archmages for the possession of the Lost Spell during a spellstorm. Shaaan was ultimately killed by the combined effort of both Malchor Harpell and Manshoon.
