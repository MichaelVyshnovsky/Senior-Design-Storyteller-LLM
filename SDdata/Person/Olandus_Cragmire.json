        "History": "In the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Cragmires formed a dark [[necromantic]] cult that schemed to take over Neverwinter and the entirety of the [[Sword Coast]]. When they were destroyed by Neverwintan forces in the {{YearlinkName|1328}}, Olandus was sealed within the [[Cragmire Barrow]], along with some of their [[undead]] army.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, having learned of the valuable artifacts Olandus kept within the Forgotten Vault, Elder Reader [[Laris (priest)|Laris]] sent an adventurer to retrieve them. Upon reaching Olandus after defeating many of his guardians, the lich was impressed with the adventurer's power, and quizzed them about the fate of his once-noble family. If the adventurer answered incorrectly, they were faced with a final guardian [[bone golem]]; if they answered correctly, they were free to pass through and collect the coffer containing the artifacts."
