'''Necalama''' was a [[half-elf]] inhabitant of the [[Yuirwood]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{cite book/Stardeep|126-132|11}}

==Personality==
Necalama showed great selflessness, being willing to guide travelers through portals in the [[Yuirwood]] for no price. He also found roars and snarls from great predators to be of no consequence.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1375}}, he guided [[Raidon Kane]] and [[Adrik Commorand]] during the snow season, some time after [[Midwinter]], for two days towards a rune stone column leading to [[Relkath's Foot]]. Crossing the threshold deposited them in the town, where he told them about the [[Relkath's Foot/Royal Hall|Royal Hall]] and about two inns, the [[Relkath's Foot/Green Man|Green Man]] and [[Relkath's Foot/The Taproot|The Taproot]]. He recommended they try the rootweal at Green Man, and eventually relented in accepting two gold pieces from Raidon.
