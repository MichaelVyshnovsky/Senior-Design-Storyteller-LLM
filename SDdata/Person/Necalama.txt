Necalama was a half-elf inhabitant of the Yuirwood in the late 14 century DR.
Necalama showed great selflessness, being willing to guide travelers through portals in the Yuirwood for no price. He also found roars and snarls from great predators to be of no consequence.
In , he guided Raidon Kane and Adrik Commorand during the snow season, some time after Midwinter, for two days towards a rune stone column leading to Relkaths Foot. Crossing the threshold deposited them in the town, where he told them about the Royal Hall and about two inns, the Green Man and The Taproot. He recommended they try the rootweal at Green Man, and eventually relented in accepting two gold pieces from Raidon.
