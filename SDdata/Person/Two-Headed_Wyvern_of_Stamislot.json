        "mainbody": "The '''Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot''' was a unique [[wyvern]] creature that, unlike other specimens, had two heads. The creature lived in the late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "The Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot was killed by the mercenary and adventuring duo of [[Talarenne]] and the person who would become known as the hero of [[Daggerford]]. The friends battled the dreaded creature under the cover of the night during a storm. At one point, Talarenne pulled the hero of Daggerford out of the creature's maw but missed the second head that bit Tala on her backside. Eventually, the beast was slain sometime before [[1372 DR]]."
