        "mainbody": "The Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot was a unique wyvern creature that, unlike other specimens, had two heads. The creature lived in the late 14 century DR. \nThe Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot was killed by the mercenary and adventuring duo of Talarenne and the person who would become known as the hero of Daggerford. The friends battled the dreaded creature under the cover of the night during a storm. At one point, Talarenne pulled the hero of Daggerford out of the creatures maw but missed the second head that bit Tala on her backside. Eventually, the beast was slain sometime before 1372 DR."
