Trahnt was a hill giant warrior inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Trahnt embarked upon exploring Undermountain and returned a changed manâ€“literally since he entered as a gnome and exited the mysterious dungeon as a hill giant. He laying dying within Undermountain with his comrades from a deadly skirmish with the Dusk Gnolls when a wizard happened upon him and left his fate to a flip of a coin. Trahnt remembered being hoisted out of Undermountain through a well in the Yawning Portal.
Following his transformation, he used several rubies to purchase a tavern called Tymoras Blessing and establish himself as a respectable businessman. His cheerful attitude helped sway those who where hesitant because of his immense stature.
He wore a ring of water walking as an earring.
