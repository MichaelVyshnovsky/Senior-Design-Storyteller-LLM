'''Trahnt''' was a [[hill giant]] warrior inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Trahnt embarked upon exploring [[Undermountain]] and returned a changed manâ€“literally since he entered as a [[gnome]] and exited the mysterious dungeon as a hill giant. He laying dying within Undermountain with his comrades from a deadly skirmish with the [[Dusk Gnolls]] when a [[wizard]] happened upon him and left his fate to a flip of a coin. Trahnt remembered being hoisted out of Undermountain through a well in the [[Yawning Portal]].

Following his transformation, he used several [[rubies]] to purchase a tavern called [[Tymora's Blessing]] and establish himself as a respectable businessman. His cheerful attitude helped sway those who where hesitant because of his immense stature.

==Possessions==
He wore a ''[[ring of water walking]]'' as an earring.
