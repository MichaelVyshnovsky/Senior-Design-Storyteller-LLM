Captain Thoster was a "merchant"—pirate—with a witty, macabre sense of humor and he was a loyal friend.
While on board ship, he wore a prodigious hat, a gold-trimmed coat, and a slender, straight sword in a silver sheath.
He wielded a blade of venom, a slender straight sword with metallic disks inserted into the hilt. The disks whirled and pumped poison through hair-thin conduits in the blade, coating it with an emerald sheen. The blade was of Lantanese origin and Thoster found it in Lantans watery remains.
Thoster hired the mercenary wizard Seren Juramot. He had worked with Nogah several times.
Thosters heritage manifested itself in increments periodically during his quest. Originally, he believed it to be of kuo-toa origin, but eventually it was revealed to him (through an extremely painful transformation) that he was in actuality a demon scion, a direct descendant of the demon lord Dagon.
