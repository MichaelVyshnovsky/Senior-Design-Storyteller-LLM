'''Aulruick Thoster''' He was one of the heroes attempting to stop the [[noble eladrin|eladrin]] [[Malyanna]] from opening the [[Far Manifold]] with the [[Key of Stars (artifact)|Key of Stars]] in the {{YearlinkName|1396}}.

==Personality==
Captain Thoster was a "merchant"—pirate—with a witty, macabre sense of humor and he was a loyal friend.

==Description==
While on board ship, he wore a prodigious hat, a gold-trimmed coat, and a slender, straight [[sword]] in a silver sheath.

==Possessions==
He wielded a [[blade of venom]], a slender straight sword with metallic disks inserted into the hilt. The disks whirled and pumped poison through hair-thin conduits in the blade, coating it with an emerald sheen. The blade was of [[Lantan]]ese origin and Thoster found it in [[Lantan]]'s watery remains.

==Relationships==
Thoster hired the mercenary wizard [[Seren Juramot]]. He had worked with [[Nogah]] several times.

==Ancestry==
Thoster's heritage manifested itself in increments periodically during his quest. Originally, he believed it to be of [[kuo-toa]] origin, but eventually it was revealed to him (through an extremely painful transformation) that he was in actuality a 'demon scion', a direct descendant of the [[demon lord]] [[Dagon]].
