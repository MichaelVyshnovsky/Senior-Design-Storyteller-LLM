Najib bin Kamal al-Asad was Sheikh of the House of Asad tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. He was considered by some to be the most powerful leader of all the desert tribes.
Najib was a lean and hardened desert rider.
Nabil travelled to Tajar once a year for trade.
Najibs wife, Alia al-Jamal umm Nabil, also served as his chief vizier. Najib cared so much for Alia that he willingly chose not to take other wives, though it was well within his right to do so. Najibs eldest son was Nabil bin Najib.
