        "mainbody": "Most Fervid Fire Grilyanthyn of Thay was a Thayan fire elementalist and priest of Kossuth active in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nGrilyanthyn was a bulky human man who stood  tall.\nGrilyanthyn aspired to be accepted by Kossuth as one of his specialty priests. He had a genius-level intellect.\nHe preferred to avoid combat, dressing in disguise if needed and fleeing if attacked. His preferred tactic was to use a combination of invisibility and either air walk or fly to escape his enemies. If forced to fight, he favored spells like burning hands, cause blindness, cause deafness, hold person, fireball, magic missile, and slay living.\nGrilyanthyn was a resident of the Flaming Brazier, the most notable temple of Kossuth in Thay, and held the rank of \"Most Fervid Fire\" within the Kossuthan clergy.While his affiliation with the Order of Crimson Warlocks is not stated in The Quest for Fire, he fits the description of a member given that he is a wizard with the rank of \"Most Fervid Fire\".\nWhen a Kossuthan curse struck Procampur in an apparent show of Kossuths displeasure over the construction of a shrine to Istishia, Grilyanthyn traveled to the city in hopes that he could witness his gods wrath and prove his worthiness by destroying the shrine. He falsely believed that the curse was an invitation for him to show his power."
