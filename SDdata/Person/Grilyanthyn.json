        "Description": "Grilyanthyn was a bulky [[human]] man who stood {{SI|5'8|'\"|c|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Personality": "Grilyanthyn aspired to be accepted by Kossuth as one of his [[specialty priest]]s. He had a genius-level intellect.\n\nHe preferred to avoid combat, dressing in disguise if needed and fleeing if attacked. His preferred tactic was to use a combination of ''[[invisibility]]'' and either ''[[air walk]]'' or ''[[fly]]'' to escape his enemies. If forced to fight, he favored spells like ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[cause blindness]]'', ''[[cause deafness]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[slay living]]''.",
        "History": "Grilyanthyn was a resident of the [[Flaming Brazier]], the most notable temple of Kossuth in Thay,{{Cite organized play/LC/The Quest for Fire|3}} and held the rank of \"Most Fervid Fire\" within the [[Kossuthan]] clergy.<ref group=\"note\">While his affiliation with the Order of Crimson Warlocks is not stated in ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'', he fits the description of a member given that he is a [[wizard]] with the rank of \"Most Fervid Fire\".\n\nWhen a Kossuthan [[curse]] struck [[Procampur]] in an apparent show of Kossuth's displeasure over the construction of a [[Shrine of Istishia (Procampur)|shrine]] to [[Istishia]], Grilyanthyn traveled to the city in hopes that he could witness his god's wrath and prove his worthiness by destroying the shrine.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Quest for Fire|4}} He falsely believed that the curse was an invitation for him to show his power."
