        "mainbody": "'''Fowler''' was a ship captain that sailed the seas around the [[Dragon Coast]], such as the [[Dragonmere]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He had the gray-green skin and strong, jutting forehead that were common among [[half-orc]]s of the Realms. and prominent yellow fangs and large tusks that lent to his nickname.",
        "Personality": "At sea, Fowler was a stern and unforgiving master, insistent that a ship's captain was its ultimate authority and anyone that dared question their directions were mutinous scum.\n\nFowler valued his ship's well-being over that of most of its crew, often hiring criminals and other less-desirable types. Anyone lost during a voyage were simple the sacrifice that [[Umberlee]] required to ensure safe passage for the rest.",
        "Activities": "For a time in the 1460s [[DR]], Fowler captained the ''[[Storm Sprite]]'',",
        "Relationships": "Fowler was an ally of the [[Harpers]],\n\nHe had a hopeless crush on a [[half-elven]] woman named [[Sharee]] that worked on a tavern in [[Saerloon]].<ref name=\"VD-p210 />",
        "History": "{{Quote|Now, you alley-spawned son of a tavern hag, open the weapon lockers before the witch calls the squids to drag us all down to Umberlee.|Fowler, barking orders to the ''[[Storm Sprite]]'s'' crew.}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Fowler agreed to give save passage south across the Dragonmere to [[Ruha]], a novice agent of the Harpers. During their journey, they encountered a [[Shou]] [[Ginger Lady|caravel]] being attacked by a [[dracolich]]. Under Ruha's insistence, Fowler sailed the ''Storm Sprite'' towards the other ship and managed to save its passengers, at the cost of their own vessel. Left stranded at sea clinging on to the remnants of their ship, Fowler and Ruha were rescued by the people they themselves saved, and given passage to [[Pros]].\n\nFowler remained with Ruha as her traveling companion under the promise that he would be given a new ship to captain by the Harpers. He accompanied her to the [[Ginger Palace]] south of [[Elversult]], disguised as a burly [[Bedine]] man named \"Fowal'sid\", and fortunately escaped when Ruha had caused great alarm in the embassy. He returned later with Vaerana Hawklyn, as the Lady Constable came to negotiate Ruha's release after she had been taken prisoner.\n\nThe gruff but affable sea captain finally met his demise after Vaerana and the [[Maces of Elversult]] had retrieved Ruha and ventured back to [[Moonstorm House]] in Elversult. The first night back, Fowler and the mansion's cook Silavia were slain by the traitorous cleric of [[Mask]], [[Tombor the Jolly]]."
