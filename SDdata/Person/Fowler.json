        "mainbody": "owler was a ship captain that sailed the seas around the Dragon Coast, such as the Dragonmere, during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe had the gray-green skin and strong, jutting forehead that were common among half-orcs of the Realms. and prominent yellow fangs and large tusks that lent to his nickname.\nAt sea, Fowler was a stern and unforgiving master, insistent that a ships captain was its ultimate authority and anyone that dared question their directions were mutinous scum.\nFowler valued his ships well-being over that of most of its crew, often hiring criminals and other less-desirable types. Anyone lost during a voyage were simple the sacrifice that Umberlee required to ensure safe passage for the rest.\nFor a time in the 1460s DR, Fowler captained the Storm Sprite,\nFowler was an ally of the Harpers,\nHe had a hopeless crush on a half-elven woman named Sharee that worked on a tavern in Saerloon.\nIn the , Fowler agreed to give save passage south across the Dragonmere to Ruha, a novice agent of the Harpers. During their journey, they encountered a Shou caravel being attacked by a dracolich. Under Ruhas insistence, Fowler sailed the Storm Sprite towards the other ship and managed to save its passengers, at the cost of their own vessel. Left stranded at sea clinging on to the remnants of their ship, Fowler and Ruha were rescued by the people they themselves saved, and given passage to Pros.\nFowler remained with Ruha as her traveling companion under the promise that he would be given a new ship to captain by the Harpers. He accompanied her to the Ginger Palace south of Elversult, disguised as a burly Bedine man named \"Fowalsid\", and fortunately escaped when Ruha had caused great alarm in the embassy. He returned later with Vaerana Hawklyn, as the Lady Constable came to negotiate Ruhas release after she had been taken prisoner.\nThe gruff but affable sea captain finally met his demise after Vaerana and the Maces of Elversult had retrieved Ruha and ventured back to Moonstorm House in Elversult. The first night back, Fowler and the mansions cook Silavia were slain by the traitorous cleric of Mask, Tombor the Jolly."
