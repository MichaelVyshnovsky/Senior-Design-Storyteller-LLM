'''Jemzo Bakadi''' and his brother, [[Jamzo Bakadi]], were prominent [[thieves]] from [[Memnon]] of [[Calimshan]] ''circa'' [[972 DR]].

{{quote|''No job was too big, no vault too well protected, and no maiden was able to resist the Bakadi brothers.''|Old Calishite legend}}

==History==
Jamzo and Jemzo grew up on the hot, sweaty streets of Memnon, surviving on crime and thefts. Eventually, they proved to be the finest rogues to have ever been born in the Calishite city. They quickly gained a legendary reputation for their skills, cunning, and bravery. The infamy led them to head one of the major crime cartels of Calimshan.

Sometime ''circa'' 972 DR, the brothers came up with a plan to pull off the greatest heist of a lifetime. They disappeared in almost complete secrecy, never to be seen again with only the cartel's lieutenant knowing the thieves' brazen plot.

The Bakadi brothers set out to rob a great [[warrior]]-[[wizard]] [[Sunder Halyndliam]] of his magical treasures but failed as was evident by their skulls being stored in the mage's crypt underneath [[Liam's Hold]], after it was briefly opened in [[1372 DR]]. The wizard's punishment must've been grand as the skulls showed signs of arcane tinkering and turned into a powerful artifact known as the ''[[Bone Brothers Bakadi]].''
