'''Feonor''' was a [[human]] warlord in [[Avernus]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Feonor was easily recognisable by her milky-white eyes and her parasol made of bones and flesh.

==Personality==
Feonor's most distinctive personality characteristic was her constant annoyance at all the multiverse around her. Because of this, she spoke only by whispering and using short sentences.

==History==
Once Feonor lived in an unknown [[Prime Material plane]] but was invited to [[Avernus]] by [[Mahadi]]. However, after arriving in [[Hell]] she grew bored of Mahadi's attentions and decided to leave the [[Wandering Emporium]] and to become one of the warlords of Avernus by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}{{BG-DiA-time}}. 

==Relationship==
Mahadi was fascinated by her [[zombie]]-like personality and still resented her departure.
