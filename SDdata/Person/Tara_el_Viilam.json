        "mainbody": "'''Tara yr Meriel el Viilam''', who became known as '''Tara of the Burning Mists''', was the creator of the [[Bottlemist Plague]], which killed thousands of people in [[Almraiven]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard (1370 DR)]]. Several other acts of terrorism were afterward attributed to her as well.",
        "Relationships": "Tara was the second daughter of the \"Veiled Caleph\" of Almraiven,",
        "History": "Tara created the plague in the [[Hammer|first month]] of 1370 in an attempt to assassinate the [[Ralan el Persakhal|syl-pasha]] and his court when he visited her city the following month. Then, she hoped, [[Calimshan]] would be ruled by a magocracy again.\n\nUnfortunately, the plague was unleashed earlier than expected, and the city was crippled. An investigation by a cleric of [[Ilmater]] discovered that Tara was the one responsible, and he was found murdered soon after he revealed this information.\n\nTara then fled the School of the Arcane Hands and became a fugitive, triggering a country-wide search. By the end of the year, she had still not been found.",
        "Rumors": "Tara of the Burning Mists was thought to be responsible for the arson that destroyed [[St. Faelar's Cloisters]] in the same year of the plague.\n\nTara was also blamed for the creation of the [[Copper Cliffs]] in [[Volothamp]]. A strange [[wizard]] was seen flying over the city late in the year and cast a spell that turned all of the copper in the entire city to liquid. The copper poured from the upper parts of the city before solidifying again, forming the cliffs. The motive for this spell was not known.",
