==Personality==
Hlael was gloomy, timid, and somewhat sarcastic.

==Abilities==
Hlael was middling in power and authority within the ranks of the [[Zhentarim]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|69-77|5}} Korthauvar, in particular, could use some spells through a farscrying.

He also didn't need his neck to drink.

==Appearance==
Hlael was shorter than Korthauvar.

==Relationships==
Hlael and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]] were friendly enough, and often bantered together.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|132|8}}

==Possessions==
Hlael and Korthauvar had access to extensive resources for the purpose of scrying. He also carried some ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]''.

==History==
At some point, Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle had discovered a stretch of passageway in their hideout that was proof against ''[[scrying]]'' of some form. While there in late {{yearlink|1357}}, they badmouthed the policy of snatching [[spellfire]], considering it too costly to send more than a few moges; unknown to them, they were being spied by [[Drauthtar Inskirl]], who, taking their advice, sent the two of them alone to snatch spellfire.

They resolved to work smarter, not harder, and to try and avoid actually snatching for Shandril as long as they could. To find her, they began by scrying for gates employed recently by [[Tessaril Winter]], quickly ascertaining she had traveled along with two others through [[Tombgate]]. Reasoning those two others must've been [[Shandril Shessair]], the spellfire-wielder, and [[Narm Tamaraith]], her husband, they decided those two were headed for Scornubel. Before committing to their findings, however, they scried on Tessaril herself, only to find her protected by proximity to [[Azoun IV]] and the intense wardings that shielded him. They resorted to scrying on a highknight in Azoun's personal retinue instead, learning the two of them had been disguised as priestesses of [[Chauntea]].

Once they locked in to the caravan, Korthauvar judged it too full of dangerous people to try and snatch for spellfire directly at the time, dithering through the first few ambushes.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|175-176|11}} Though Hlael became unsettled, Drauthtar Inskirl, their immediate superior, approved of their strategy and said as much while they waited.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|207-208|13}} They were forced into action, however, as a spell materializing a cloud of blades converged on Shandril, and Korthauvar cast something through their farscrying to break that spell. Hlael then recast their farscrying.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|223-224|14}} They continued to dither afterwards as the caravan reached Triel, after taking stock of the spellfire seekers still in the caravan; though they feared Drauthtar's wrath, he informed them again he approved.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|270-273|16}} Unknown to them, they were in turn farscried by the [[Red Wizard]]s under [[Hulrivior]]'s command.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|309|18}}

They were sent into action directly by [[Hesperdan]] shortly after they scried [[Marlel]] slaying [[Hulrivior]] in [[Triel]] during a meeting.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|312|18}} They made their move just as the final ambush fell on the caravan,{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|320|18}} and converged on [[Sharantyr]], who had just arrived. Korthauvar Hammantle was slain there, by Narm Tamaraith.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|326-327|18}}

Hlael survived him and ran, looking to recruit the swordsmen currently serving [[Deverel Rinthar]], who posed as a [[cheese]] trader;{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|329-330|19}} he was skewered through his throat by [[Sharantyr]] not long after.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|335|19}} She probably missed his oesophagus and trachea somehow, as he somehow drank three ''potions of healing'' to survive just long enough to be disintegrated by Shandril's spellfire as soon as she realized he was alive.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|358|20}}
