'''Lorgyn''' was a [[malaugrym]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Lorgyn and [[Bralatar]] managed to find a new ''[[gate]]'' to [[Faerûn]]. There, they discovered that the Great Foe of the malaugrym, [[Elminster]], had been killed during the [[second battle of Shadowdale]]. So instead Bralatar and Lorgyn went to [[Sembia]] to collect [[magic]] from the [[wizard]]s of that land. There they killed the wizard [[Mortoth]] and ran into their fellow malaugrym [[Lunquar]], who was busy killing local [[Zhentarim]]. They decided to check [[Elminster's tower]], hoping to find the secrets of [[Malaug]].

Back at the Tower of Mortoth, however, Bralatar was killed in a sudden attack by [[Irendue Nuen-tar]], the most promising apprentice of Mortoth. Lorgyn took Irendue captive. He then decided to collect mages and went to [[Tilverton]] to find new members for his collection.
