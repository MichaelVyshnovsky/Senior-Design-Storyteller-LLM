        "Description": "[[File:VenomFang.jpg|thumb|270px|The appearance of Venomfang.]]\nVenomfang was a typical young green dragon. Not wanting to give up his amassed wealth, the dragon was protective of his base. However, he favored survival over death, and planned on flying away if he was badly beaten up and at risk of losing a fight. He had a plentiful hoard, containing coins and even an enchanted [[axe]] known as [[Hew]]. Venomfang spent a lot of time appreciating the contents of his hoard.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}}  the green dragon flew over [[Neverwinter Wood]] to search for a new lair. On his way, he passed over [[Thundertree]] and spotted an abandoned tower. He tore his way through the roof and killed the lingering beasts within. After slaying the [[giant spider]]s infesting the tower it named its base, Venomfang decided to lie low for a time. The [[Cult of the Dragon]] planned to convene with the dragon."
