        "Relationships": "Arglas Duskeldarr was attracted to his fellow Highknight [[Malustra Thaurant‎‎]] and often had to drown his feelings in the King's [[bottle]]s and [[decanter]]s.",
        "History": "Arglas Duskeldarr's main function was serving as the King's cellarer, personally tasting every bottle, every drink, and every decanter that was to reach the ruler's lips to ensure his safety. He often worked closely with Malustra Thaurant‎‎, under the direct orders of [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], the Royal Court Wizard of Cormyr. The duo were tasked with taking acre of adventurers favored by the King, who turned to treason and proved to be danger to the throne. Together they disposed of about half a dozen individuals, often via [[poison]] and subterfuge."
