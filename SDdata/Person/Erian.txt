'''Erian''' was a soldier in [[Caer Corwell]].

==Description==
Erian was a huge man with strong corded muscles.

==Personality==
As a veteran of [[Corwell|Corwell's]] guards, Erian despised peacetime and enjoyed the thrill of battle.

==History==
After arresting [[Daryth]] in [[1345 DR]], Erian entered the Festival of the Spring Equinox to drink [[Callidyrr mead]] at the tent of [[Geoffrey]] and met the lovely [[Kazgoroth|Meridith]].

===Death===
Later that evening in 1345 DR, Erian laid down with Meridith, who was actually the Darkwalker [[Kazgoroth]] in disguise, and as their lips touched, the monster stole Erian's life energy and replaced it with an [[evil]] presence.
