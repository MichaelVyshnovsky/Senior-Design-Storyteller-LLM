Joseph was a human from Faer√ªn who stowed away on a ship headed for Maztica.
Joseph was a light-skinned man with flowing, blonde hair. He wore light brown pants and a ragged, blue shirt. The ensemble was tied together with a black sword belt.
Possessed of a cheerful attitude, Joseph was intent on proving to the world that he was the best at everything. This conviction manifested itself more as enthusiasm rather than arrogance.
He owned a magical short sword and a ring of feather falling, in addition to a potion of healing and a mundane trident.
Hoping to explore the world, Joseph absconded from his uncle and stowed away on a ship bound for Maztica. When eventually discovered, he was thrown overboard and washed up on an island. On this island, he met the local Maztican tribesman Swendi and cooperated with him to take down a pteranodon.
