}}'''Ghunayya of the Rose Petal''' was a [[human]] [[privateer]] captain living on [[Masud Jazayir]] in the [[Crowded Sea]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Ghunayya captained a ship known as either the ''[[Djinni's Flower]]'' or the ''[[Floating Rose]]''. She targeted [[Zakhara]]n ships owned by her employers' rivals, stealing the goods and returning them to [[Bandar al-Sa'adat]] where she kept half of the profits.

She was respected among the other inhabitants of Masud Jazayir for spreading the wealth from her ventures.
