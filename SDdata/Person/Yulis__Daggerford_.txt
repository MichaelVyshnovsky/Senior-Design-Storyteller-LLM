'''Yulis''' was one of the defenders of [[Daggerford]] who perished in the line of duty long before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
After Yulis's death, he was buried in the [[Daggerford Graveyard]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] outside of the city's walls. His grave was located at the south-eastern edge of the graveyard. The headstone was in good shape and still had legible writings as of 1372 DR.
