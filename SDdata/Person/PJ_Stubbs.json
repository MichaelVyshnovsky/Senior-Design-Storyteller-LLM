        "mainbody": "PJ Stubbs was sailor and a friend of Bosun Gannet of the Blushing Mermaid tavern in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , during the Absolute crisis, PJ Stubbs sailed to the nation of Calimshan, south of Baldurs Gate. There, he visited a popular local watering hole â€“ The Copper Tap, the establishment that gave him the worst night of his life, worse than an incident with a bear in Chult. The Copper Tap was known for its own award-winning brews, yet when PJ tried one, he described the taste as \"flowers having a wank on his tongue.\" Even after drinking ten pints of ale did not clear the taste out. The sailor told of the misadventure in a letter addressed to Bosun Gannet and asked the barkeep to prepare a couple of barrels of drinks for PJs next visit that was sure to wash the flower taste out at last."
