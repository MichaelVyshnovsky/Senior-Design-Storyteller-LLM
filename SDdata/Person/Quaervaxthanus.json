        "mainbody": "uaervaxthanus was a beholder mage that became Magister.\nQuaervaxthanus had a natural talent in creating and modifying spells.\nIn his youth, Quaervaxthanus was blinded by an older eye tyrant that was trying to eliminate the beholder bloodline of which Quaervaxthanus was member. He managed to escape despite the mutilation and disappeared for a long time.\nHe came back many years later as a powerful beholder mage with many powerful Netherese wands and scepters grafted into his empty eye-socket and controlled with his mind, thanks to many new spells. Quaervaxthanus was so known for his talent in spell alterations that some reclusive human archmages traded with him.\nIn 699 DR, he lured the current reigning Magister Larongar Veverell into a trap and attacked the human mage from above as he slept.\nAfter becoming Magister, Quaervaxthanus freely visited some elven mages and gave them new spells instead of killing them like he did all wizards who sought him out.\nHis doom arrived in 705 DR when the human sorcerer Almer Galarthund lured Quaervaxthanus into a sophisticated trap inside a tunnel full of explosive wands. The beholder magister died in the explosion."
