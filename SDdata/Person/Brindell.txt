Brindell was a halfling priestess of Eilistraee. Brindell was one of the Protectors of the Song in the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.
In 1377 DR, she was one of the six protectors chosen for an assault led by Cavatina Xarann on the main temple of Kiaransalee. However, after the death of Halav to a tentacle that suddenly emerged from a pool, Brindell was also attacked. At last, the Protectors managed to destroy the enemy and save Brindell.
Brindell was later killed near the Acropolis of Thanatos during fighting with the Crones of Kiaransalee when one of them attacked her from behind.
Resurrected in 1379 DR, Qilu√© Veladorn asked Brindell where Battlemistress Rylla was.
