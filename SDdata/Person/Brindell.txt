'''Brindell''' was a [[halfling]] priestess of [[Eilistraee]]. Brindell was one of the [[Protectors of the Song]] in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].
 
==History==
In [[1377 DR]], she was one of the six protectors chosen for an assault led by [[Cavatina Xarann]] on the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]]. However, after the death of [[Halav]] to a tentacle that suddenly emerged from a pool, Brindell was also attacked. At last, the Protectors managed to destroy the enemy and save Brindell.

Brindell was later killed near the [[Acropolis of Thanatos]] during fighting with the Crones of Kiaransalee when one of them attacked her from behind.

Resurrected in [[1379 DR]], [[Qilu√© Veladorn]] asked Brindell where Battlemistress [[Rylla]] was.
