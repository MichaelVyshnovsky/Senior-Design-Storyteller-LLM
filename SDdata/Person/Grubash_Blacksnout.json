        "mainbody": "Grubash Blacksnout was the tribal leader of several gnoll bands living in the Gnollwatch Mountains around 1373 DR. \nHe was known for being particularly disciplined, having cultivated amiable relations with both the human and Crinti inhabitants of Dambrath. In addition, Grubash coordinated his warbands hunting grounds to avoid conflict and contracted them out for mercenary work. They typically fought for meat, silver, and valuable trinkets."
