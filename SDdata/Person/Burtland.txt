'''Burtland''' was the stablemaster of [[Delcastle Manor]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
To [[Amarune Whitewave]]'s judgement, he looked old.

==Personality==
He was either fond of lewd humor, or too quick to assume lewd activities.

==Relationships==
He worked for the [[Delcastle]] family.

==History==
When [[Arclath Delcastle]] arrived at Delcastle Manor after the massacre at the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, he asked Burtland for some privacy while he conferred with Amarune Whitewave and [[Storm Silverhand]], who were accompanying him. Noticing Amarune was a [[coinlass]] and Storm was tied up on the horse, Burtland made some racy assumptions, annoying Arclath and Amarune.
