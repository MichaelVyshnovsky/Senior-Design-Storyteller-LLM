Burtland was the stablemaster of Delcastle Manor in Suzail, Cormyr, in the late 15 century DR.
To Amarune Whitewaves judgement, he looked old.
He was either fond of lewd humor, or too quick to assume lewd activities.
He worked for the Delcastle family.
When Arclath Delcastle arrived at Delcastle Manor after the massacre at the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the , he asked Burtland for some privacy while he conferred with Amarune Whitewave and Storm Silverhand, who were accompanying him. Noticing Amarune was a coinlass and Storm was tied up on the horse, Burtland made some racy assumptions, annoying Arclath and Amarune.
