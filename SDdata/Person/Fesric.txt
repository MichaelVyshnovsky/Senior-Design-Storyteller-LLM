'''Fesric''' was a [[Zhent]] soldier at the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in [[1367 DR]].

In the wake of the disaster that had destroyed [[Zhentil Keep]], Fesric became the leader of a group of like-minded Zhents who wanted to break away and transform the Citadel of the Raven into the base of a separate power. [[Kandar Milinal]] considered him a possible problem for the future, and he considered arranging an "accident" to befall Fesric.
