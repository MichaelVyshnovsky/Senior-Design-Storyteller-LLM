        "mainbody": "Hukdon was a member of the Shadow Thieves in Athkatla around 1370 DR.\nHukdon was very ill-mannered but he thought of himself as funny and likeable. Many underestimated him for his puny appearance.\nSomehow Hukdon acquired a pair of gauntlets of ogre power.\nHukdon worked for the enforcer and thugs chapter of the guild in Athkatla. His boss usually used him only when a \"client\" needed punishment, not for mere intimidation work."
