'''Elvar the Grainlord''' was the ruler of [[Triel]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was impersonated a lot throughout the rest of the century.

==Personality==
Elvar had true terror at the idea of running out of food, and devoted intense energy to protecting his stocks of food. He was also unusually given to change the focus of his worship, and had rotated through the entire Faerunian pantheon twice. He was a simple soul, and refused to travel away from Triel.

==Activities==
He changed his religion almost once a tenday, occupying two carpenters almost full-time. However, he was a competent leader for the farming community. He gave good advice, and got paid well.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|120-121}}

==Relationships==
A local priestess of [[Chauntea]], [[Antriera]], kept hiding his accoutrements of [[Loviatar]] when he converted to another god again. For all his excentricities, he was well-loved locally.

==History==
According to [[Arauntar]] on {{yearlink|1357}}, Elvar's madness had begun a score of years prior (approximately {{yearlink|1337}}) and had since grown so obsessed with making sure there was enough food to survive the winter that he had every rat caught and pickled, and he also allowed no outsiders in the place. He also claimed Elvar converted to a new religion every four days since- faster by then. He also claimed that Elvar was something of a thief himself.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|282|16}}

Unknown to anyone, Elvar had been dead for some time by the end of that year when [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan reached [[Triel]]. He was supplanted by an imposter since.
