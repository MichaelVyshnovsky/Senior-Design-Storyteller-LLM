'''Aghilde''' was a [[bog hag]] that lurked in the [[Druid's Deep]] of [[Thorngap]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==History==
Aghilde laired in a discrete corner of the Druid's Deep while the nearby [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] worked to conquer the world, until [[Harper]] agents arrived to eliminate the threat. They may have slain Aghilde and taken her ''[[ivy wraps]]''.
