Malgi Hi was a mysterious human sorcerer who led the lizardfolk of the ruins of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.
Malgi His appearance was just as mysterious as his past. He appeared to be a human of average build, wrapped in leather robes and many bandages that showed signs of past wounds or damage to His body. Part of his face was covered by bandages and half of a metal mask.
Malgi Hi dispised other, more "civilized" humanoids, other than his beloved lizardfolk. His leadership of one powerful tribe of the scaly lizard-men led to many confrontations with the Cult of the Dragon as well as the local orcs and orogs. Most considered him a madman.
The most notable ability Malgi Hi had was his secret arcane recipe that transformed the strongest lizardfolk warriors of his tribe into living breathing stone lizardfolk. These enchanted elite warriors took on certain properties of stone golems. Their hides became unnaturally hard, only damageable by enchanted weapons of +2 or higher power, as well as making them almost completely immune to magic.
Malgi Hi had access to countless magical trinkets his minions looted from the citys graves and ruins. On his person, he often carried a wand of hold person, a potion of full healing, and a scroll of finger of death spell.
Not much was known of Malgi His past, but he managed to find a home among the scalykind and became their spiritual leader. By 1369 DR, Malgi Hi led his tribe of lizardfolk to occupy a big part of the ruins of Myth Drannor, both above and underground. His followers regarded the sorcerer as their leader and almost worshiped him as their god. The lizardfolk took over part of various levels of the Dwarven Dungeons under the City Heights, where they fought over territory with the members of the Cult of the Dragon and orc marauders. A part of the Dungeons, a hall connecting the Halls of Stone with the surface city, was taken over by Malgi Hi and his minions completely, where they established a strong hold on the ruins. He ruled his adoring servants from the lair in Nightingale Court.
During that time, Malgi Hi was antagonizing not only various inhabitants of the ruins but also a group of heroes, known as the Veiled Ones. The mad sorcerer hated the adventurers for spilling his followers blood and often sent his fearsome stone lizardmen to attack the adventurers. Subsequently, the Veiled Ones confronted Hi in his stronghold and sent him fleeing for his life after slaughtering all the minions he threw at them.
