        "mainbody": "Erigol was a runecaster in Volkumburgh Vale between the 12 and 14 centuries DR.\nBy the 14 century, Erigol had lived so long that he had succumbed to some form of madness and lost all sense of short term memory. He was also hostile to anyone intruding upon the ruins he called home, though compared to his runecaster allies Erigol was largely benign.\nNo matter what threats he faced, Erigol could not be coerced into revealing the location of the fragments that he and his allies had scattered long ago, only cryptic clues.\nErigol was capable of casting the following spells charm person, darkness, dispel magic, magic missile, phantasmal force, and monster summoning I.\nIf he was ever murdered, Erigol would arise as a wraith and summon a dozen skeletons to attack his killer.\nLike the rest of his runecaster allies, Erigol was dressed in a set of padded armor and armed with a runestick made of yew-wood, as well as a runewand made from ebony. He also had a wyvern mount at his disposal.\nIn the 14 century DR, one of Erigols greatest motivations in life was to protect the rights of the neanderthals that he and his runecaster allies commanded.\nDuring the mid-12 century DR, Erigol was a member of the College of Rune Magics. One day an injured member of the College of Shaping Magics, known as Valmous the Shaper, came to their college in flight from his rogue, rampaging creation. Thanks to Valmouss intimate knowledge of it, they were able to defeat the Awtawmatawn. Though the College of Rune Magics was left in ruin and only a few students survived.\nValmous, sensing an evil presence trapped within the fragments of the Awtawmatawn, tasked Erigol and his fellow rune adepts with scattering its pieces across the Volkumburgh Vale.\nIn 1358 DR, they became aware that someone had discovered one of Awtawmatawns fragments and was seeking to rebuild it.The Shattered Statue is a bit vague at times about how many rune adepts there are, likely to allow for DMs to create more, but page 29 specifies that there is \"a total of four.\" They rallied a dozen neanderthals and two of their wyverns to assault a group of adventurers,The canonical amount of rune adepts in The Shattered Statue is four, but the ambush states there can only be a \"total of three [rune adepts]\" and page 13 states that, \"Only Edwood and the Adepts who survived the ambush in Chapter One will be here.\" Taken together, it can be inferred that all but Edwood were present for that event. who had been hired by the wizard Amelior Amanitas to search for the fragments of Awtawmatawn. Referring to them as the \"evil ones\" and\n\"bringers of doom.\"\nThe adventurers ultimately won out, sending Erigol and his allies fleeing back to their home, where they underwent a ritual of healing and tended to their wyverns. Later, Erigol and his fellow runecasters were lead by an arisen Valmous, alongside a host of forty neanderthals, to assault the village of Volkumburgh after Amelior had managed to reassemble the Awtawmatawn."
