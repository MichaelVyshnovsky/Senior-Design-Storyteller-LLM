General Vandemar Cordwin was a particularly powerful and influential priest of Tempus in the city of Arrabar during the late 14 century DR.
In 1370 DR, General Cordwin would often give boisterous and angry public tirades against Baron Thuragar of Ormpetarr to his clergy. Though these firebrand speeches were supported by the ruling family of Arrabar their reasoning was something of a mystery.
Although he was known as a strong-willed and energetic leader, he had the reputation of being somewhat of a zealot.
Along with the magical armor and weapons that would expected of a leader within the church of Tempus, General Cordwin wore a ring of spell turning and carried a rod of passage.
