'''Suelasta''' was a collector of exotic animals who lived in [[Tajar]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] region of [[west Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Suelasta's menagerie was located near [[Al-Adib River]] within the city. Though he strove hard to collect an impressive variety of animals and monsters from all over [[Toril|Al-Toril]], his safety practices were somewhat lacking, resulting in the occasional breakout of a savage creature within Tajar.
