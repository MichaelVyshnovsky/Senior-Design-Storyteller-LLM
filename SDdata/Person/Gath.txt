Gath was an artist and shopkeeper active in Waterdeep during the 15 century DR.
Gath was a short man wearing messy, mismatching clothes. While known in the neighborhood as an honest shopkeeper, Gath was actually a werewolf in the service of Artor Morlin, the Baron of Blood.
When he saw an inspiring scene Gath would paint it without caring about consequences. This could prove dangerous, such as when he reproduced the likeness of the crypt used as a secret lair by his master.
