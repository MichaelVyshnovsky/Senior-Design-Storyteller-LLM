'''Gath''' was an artist and shopkeeper active in [[Waterdeep]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Map with No Names|10,12}}

==Description==
Gath was a short man wearing messy, mismatching clothes. While known in the neighborhood as an honest shopkeeper, Gath was actually a [[werewolf]] in the service of [[Artor Morlin]], the ''Baron of Blood''.

==Personality==
When he saw an inspiring scene Gath would paint it without caring about consequences. This could prove dangerous, such as when he reproduced the likeness of the crypt used as a secret lair by his master.
