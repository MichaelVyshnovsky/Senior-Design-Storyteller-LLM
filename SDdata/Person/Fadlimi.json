        "mainbody": "\"Fadlimi\" was a doppelganger assassin working for the Sons of Gondegal bandit gang in Cormyr in the late 1370s DR.\nFadlimi posed as a young and beautiful human woman of slender build and dark hair.\nUsing this guise in Suzail, Fadlimi plied a retired scout of the Purple Dragons, Ingo Siegur, for information, by getting the old man to become infatuated with her and persistently asking for tales of his military career. In this way, Fadlimi learned Purple Dragons tactics, formations, sites of caches of supplies and weapons, passwords. Armed with this intelligence, Fadlimi and the Sons of Gondegal had ambitious plans to infiltrate the Kings Forest and from there conquer Arabel."
