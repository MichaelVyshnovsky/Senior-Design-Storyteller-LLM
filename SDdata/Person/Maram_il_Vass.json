        "mainbody": "Maram il Vass was a powerful ultroloth in the Deep Wastes n the late 15 century DR.\nMaram had found a better approach than warmongering. Instead, he developed a refuge on the Prime Material Plane from which to trade his goods and his secrets.\nMaram was cunning and had a painstaking attention to detail, yet was extremely charming, a trait he knew how to use.\nMaram was once an ultroloth living in Gehenna. At one point, he worked for the demon lord Grazzt in the Outer Planes, distinguishing himself in his service, and the two separated on good terms.\nHowever, after becoming bored of war, Maram constructed a refuge in the Deep Wastes in Torils Underdark. There, he worked to expand his collections of exotic things and beings.\nCirca 1486 DR, with the arrival of Grazzt in the Underdark, Maram renewed his partnership with the demon lord. At the same time, he used this connection to add to his collection. Queen Hledh Hellspawn of Maerimydra granted him the drow alchemist Xaven Tanorthis of Szith Morcane.\nLater, an adventuring party hired by Murssvayas Dhuurniv went to Marams lair to free Xaven."
