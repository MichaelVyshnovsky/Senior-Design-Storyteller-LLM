        "mainbody": "Grint Thorg was an adventurer and a fighter from the city of Baldurs Gate who died some years before the late 15 century DR.\nGrint Thorg perished sometime before the  while adventuring in the infamous Tower of Durlag on the Sword Coast. The fighters body could not be recovered by the adventuring comrades so instead of Grint, the comrades buried Thorgs  pole in the Lower City Graveyard, near the cemetery arched gate and the Durinbold Mausoleum. The gravestone was etched with a single inscription \"Grint Thorg, Fighter, Lost in Durlags Tower. We couldnt recover your body so we buried your ten-foot pole.\" The final resting spot may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body risen as a zombie by Nina Dortmell, a talented child with a gift, who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
