        "History": "Grint Thorg perished sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}} while adventuring in the infamous [[Tower of Durlag]] on the [[Sword Coast]]. The fighter's body could not be recovered by the adventuring comrades so instead of Grint, the comrades buried Thorg's {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} pole in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], near the cemetery arched gate and the [[Durinbold Mausoleum]]. The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: \"Grint Thorg, Fighter, Lost in Durlag's Tower. We couldn't recover your body so we buried your [[ten-foot pole]].\" The final resting spot may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
