        "mainbody": "'''Alorgoth''', also known by the alias of '''Collus Darathon''',\n\n{{Quote|My followers are strong, and steadfast in their faith. The Order of the Dark Moon has no place for those that would turn to heresy.|Alorgoth, in [[1369 DR]].}}",
        "Description": "He was a tall and slender man with a pointed chin.",
        "Personality": "Alorgoth was a ruthless and sadistic man, wholly dedicated to Shar and her dogma. He had no compassion for recruits of his order that did not pass their trials, and even found pleasure in personally carrying out their executions.",
        "Abilities": "He was very skilled at altering his appearance and voice while acting under one of his aliases.\n\nWhen pressed in battle, he was not above summoning [[demon]]s to his aid.",
        "Possessions": "Among Alorgoth's possessions were a ''[[Cloak of the Dark Moon]]'', a ''[[Headband of the Devout]]'', and his pair of ''[[Night Walkers]]''. Interestingly enough for a servant of Shar, he kept a journal outlying some secrets pertaining operations carried out by the Dark Moon monks.",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|I have many names, many faces, many secrets. Consider yourself lucky, Rasaad. You have wrested a truth from me.|Alorgoth, to [[Rasaad yn Bashir]].}}\n\nAlorgoth spent much of his time traveling across [[east Faerûn]]\n\nHe often employed different aliases, such as of Collus Darathon the founder of the [[Twofold Trust]]. Using these assumed personas Alorgoth has sparked many conflicts, outright wars, and pit many close friends and loved ones against one another.\n\nAfter founding the Order of the Dark Moon, Alorgoth directed them to eradicate followers of [[Selûne]], specifically monks of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]].",
        "Relationships": "While Alorgoth and his monks operated independently of the Sharran church, he commanded great authority among the faithful.\n\nHe had an ally in [[Yxtrazzal]], a [[shadow dragon]] that was in possession of the ''[[Wheel of Obliteration]]''.",
        "History": "Alorgoth received a holy directive from Shar to found the Order of the Dark Moon, with three distinct criteria: all recruits would be young adults, with no previous affiliation with the Sharran clergy, and most importantly, each had to demonstrate distinct [[sorcerous]] abilities. \n\nHe traveled from eastern Faerûn to Amn, and established the first monastery of his order in the city of [[Purskul]] in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}. He then toured the cities of the realm, passing through [[Keczulla]], [[Crimmor]], and even the capital of [[Athkatla]] in search of potential recruits for Shar's new order. It was there in the City of Coin that Alorgoth discovered [[Gamaz]], a young Sun Soul monk that would convert to the worship of Shar and lead the [[Dark Moon monastery]] in the [[Cloud Peaks]].\n\nAfter finding about a dozen individuals that could fulfill Shar's will, Alorgoth returned to Purskul with his new pupils, to carry begin their years-long course of training.\n\nWhile still in Amn, Alorgoth exploited the emergent [[Dark Moon heresy]] to form a new cult of the \"Twofold Truth\" that attracted worshipers of Selûne away from [[Church of Selûne|her church]]. Using the alias of Collus Darathon, he gathered the Selûnites—along with novice Sharrans that veered away from her sole worship—at the [[Temple of the Twofold Goddess]] to be slaughtered outright by his more experienced Dark Moon monks. Fortunately for the novice monks of both faiths, the attack was thwarted by the Sun Soul monk [[Rasaad yn Bashir]], his ally [[Abdel Adrian]], and their traveling companions.\n\nLater that year, Alorgoth then ventured to [[Mount Deepstone]] with a cell of Sharrans that had enslaved the dwarves of [[Clan Deepstone]]. The Sharrans forced the Deepstone dwarves to dig down to a cluster of [[shadow crystal]]s, which they could then use to open a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Shadowfell]] by utilizing the ''Wheel of Obliteration''.\n\nSome time around the {{YearlinkName|1370}},<ref group=\"note\">The 3{{rd}} edition sourcebook ''[[Lords of Darkness]]'' states this occurred in [[1370 DR]], while the 3.5 edition book ''[[Champions of Ruin]]'' states this occurred in [[1371 DR]]. Alorgoth turned operations of the temple over to clergy of Shar, and he and the first strike out at Shar's enemies across the Realms. They influence spread all the way from their home in Amn, north to [[Baldur's Gate]], all the way to to [[Cormyr]] in the [[Eastern Heartlands]]."
