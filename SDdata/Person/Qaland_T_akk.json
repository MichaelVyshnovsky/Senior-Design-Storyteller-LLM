        "mainbody": "Qaland Takk was a barbarian and the tyrannical and warmongering qaghan of the Igidujin tribe and the city of Quaraqand in the Chigidi Mountains in the Plain of Horses region circa .\nThinking of little else but warfare, Takk believed he was destined to conquer the world and reign over all the peoples in it. He was arrogant, murderous, and without mercy. He bore a special hatred for the rival Fankiang tribe and their leader at Li-Raz, Qaghan Chuqali Shilai.\nHe had dark-brown skin and gray hair that grew down to his waist, with a body that was as hard as a rock. He wielded a bronze sword.\nA member of the Qaland family, he was a descendant of the feared Qaland Shurijah, who first united the Igidujin tribe.\nUnder Takk, the Igidujin often raided the surrounding villages, nomad camps, and caravans, especially those of the Fankiang. Ostensibly, these raids were to steal Steppe horses but in truth it was largely to sate their bloodlust. They massacred their victims, leaving no man, woman, or child alive.\nUnder the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. The most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason against Takk, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain. Furthermore, Takk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by Takk himself."
