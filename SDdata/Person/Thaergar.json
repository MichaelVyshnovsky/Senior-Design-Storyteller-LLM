        "mainbody": "haergar, or Thaergar of the Doors was a guard in the Veltalar palace in the mid-late 14 century DR.\nHe liked to play with mice.\nHe had a dagger at his belt and a shiny sword, but normally wielded a glaive, wearing a gauntlet on at least one hand. The belt also held a bag of dice, some cheese on a string, and an air solitaire deck with the beauties of Thay on the back of every card.\nAs of , Thaergar had long served the Simbul. During the day in which she went scouring Avernus in search of Elminster, he gave her his belt after she forgot to put on her own, accidentally losing that way a pack of air solitaire cards, and a cheese and string kit for a mouse he liked to play with.\nAfter the tumult upon the return of Elminster, Thaergar managed to prevent Phaeldara from getting crushed by some rubble. It took some time to dig them out."
