        "mainbody": "artkiller was the last son of Annam All-Father and Othea. He was the husband of the human Varissa.\nHis mother deliberately delayed his birth because she had made a deal with Annam that he could only return once his son called his name, but she was then poisoned by another of her sons, Lanaxis, and died. When she died, she was in the form of a mountain, and Hartkiller still managed to get out into the open from the \"womb cave\".\nOne of his first actions was eating a deer, from which he took his name.\nHartkiller soon began the task of restoring Ostoria to its former glory, the reason he had been conceived in the first place. Because of his short stature, his siblings would not believe that he was chosen by Annam for this task and refused to help, so he sought help from the humans instead, in return for protection from the giants. The giant-kin (those fathered by Ulutiu and not Annam) took Hartkillers side against the giants in the War of the Hart. The kingdom became known as Hartsvale and the area survived in modern-day Faerûn.\nHartkiller died at the end of the War of the Hart in a battle with the storm giant paramount that was said to have lasted for more than a hundred days.\nHe was only 12 (3.6 m) tall and so he was considered to be a \"runt\".\nHartkiller was the youngest son of Annam the All-Father and Lord of the Vale. He was kind and good, though a bit patronizing. He believed in the strength of lesser races, but did not truly see them as equals. He believed that he was fated to restore his father’s kingdom, but saw a prominent place in it for humanoids.\nHe freed himself from the womb of his deceased mother after she was poisoned by her son, Lanaxis—the father of the titans. Considered a runt, he eventually defeated the giants in the War of the Hart but was slain in personal combat by the ruler of storm giants in a battle that lasted 100 days.\nHartkiller favored a world where giants ruled over all others. He viewed humans as favored children who it is a giant’s duty to guide and protect. He had always believed the smallfolk were more capable than his brothers.\nHartkillers mother was Othea and his father was Annam All-Father. His brothers were Lanaxis, Masud, Nicias, Obadai, Ottar, Ruk, Vilmos, Arno and Julian, and his half-brothers included Dunmore Hartkiller had a half-human, half-giant son, Brun."
