        "mainbody": "Gatekeeper Arkwright was guardian of a great gate in the Shadowfell city of Evernight, which led from the Graveyard into the city proper, during the late 15 century DR.\nArkwright interrogated mortals attempting to enter Evernight via a Crevice of Dusk that had brought them to the Graveyard. If properly convinced, he would also be willing to petition the Tribunal of Evernight on their behalf. However, he was quick to slay any who then broke a pact with the Tribunal.\nHe was owed an old debt by the lich Zarifrax, whom he referred to as \"that old rattlebones\".\nDuring the crisis appearance of the Cloaked Ascendancy in Neverwinter, a hero from Neverwinter was instructed by Zarifrax on how to enter Evernight and then to speak with Arkwright. Upon repayment of the lichs debt, Arkwright agreed to petition the Tribunal for the heros protection, and to seek their guidance for the heros suicidal mission to infiltrate the Shard of Night."
