'''Johnston''' was one of the defenders of [[Daggerford]] who perished in the line of duty long before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
After Johnston's death, he was buried in the [[Daggerford Graveyard]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] outside of the city's walls. His grave was located just by the entrance to the mortuary mausoleum at the center of the graveyard. The headstone was in good shape and still had legible writings as of 1372 DR.
