'''Quickstrike''' was possibly the last specimen of slug-like creatures called [[gravecrawler]]s or "ancestor worms".

==Description==
Quickstrike had a gray, plump, segmented body with a hairless and eyeless man-like head. His physiology allowed him only a crawling movement. He emanated an aura of [[petrification]], causing agony and paralysis in living creatures and eventually turning any living or dead creature to stone. This prevented them from being raised by [[necromantic]] means.

==History==
He was left to guard the catacombs of a long-gone kingdom that once existed in the [[Sunrise Mountains]] in [[Thay]]. The builders of the catacombs were afraid of their dead being raised as [[zombie]]s. Quickstrike's duty was to petrify the corpses and make them impossible to reanimate as [[undead]].

In the first years of his existence, he ate the flesh of the corpses, absorbing their knowledge and wisdom.

In [[1375 DR]], the [[bard]] [[Bareris Anskuld]] stumbled upon Quickstrike during his escape from undead pursuers.
