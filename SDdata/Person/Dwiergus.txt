==Realm==
Dwiergus's realm was known as the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 558: Flesh Forges|Flesh Forges]], and was the 558{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]].{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|47-49}}

==Description==
Dwiergus was a large, formless mass of demonic flesh whose features were constantly forming and liquifying. During battle, he occasionally wore suits of chitinous armour.
