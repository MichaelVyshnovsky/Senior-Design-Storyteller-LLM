        "mainbody": "Duke '''Dashard Devlin''', also known as '''Helmont the 14th''', was the twenty-first duke of the Duchy of [[Carmathan]] in the Kingdom of [[Damara]]. He ruled during the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Dashard was the fourth cousin of the previous duke, [[Helmont the 13th]]. His successor as Duke of Carmathan, [[Theodorus Devlin|Theodorus]], claimed to be his long-lost brother, although the legitimacy of this claim was disputed.",
        "History": "After [[Zhengyi]] the Witch-King seized control of [[Damara]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, one of his first actions was to kill the duke of Carmathan, Helmont the 13th, and all his family. Only Zhengyi's ally and puppet Dashard survived and, as planned, Zhengyi appointed him as new duke. Under his master's guidance, Dashard built an efficient propaganda network and gained the loyalty of the citizens of Carmathan.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Dashard heard tales of the great wealth coming out of the [[Bloodstone Mines]] and desired it for himself. Profiting off the attack of Duke [[William Horgath]] of [[Arcata]] against the [[Barony of Bloodstone]], Dashard also sent a great and efficient army against Bloodstone. However, near [[Valls]] in the [[Bloodstone_Wars#Fight_of_Three_Borders|Fight of Three Borders]], the [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] army led by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] defeated the Carmathans after fierce fighting, and Dashard was killed by the wizard [[Emelyn the Gray]].",
