Joei the Aged was a wu jen merchant in Kuda in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In the city of Kuda, Joei managed a very lucrative business of importing exotic items under licenses by both the emperor and the shogun. He often disappeared for months or even years searching for items with his ship. Even when Joei was in the city, nobody knew his true activities. Many thieves met their end entering his warehouse. People spread rumors that Joei acquired his licenses by doing illegal deeds for the emperor and shogun.
Joei had always at his side his Shou clerk Lu and three bodyguards two Hordelands barbarians and the small Saigo.
