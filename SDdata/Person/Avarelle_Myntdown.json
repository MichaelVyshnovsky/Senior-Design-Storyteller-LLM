        "mainbody": "Avarelle Myntdown was a seamstress from Hultail in Cormyr active in the late 15 century DR.\nAvarelle was a well-liked aging matronly woman who once was a stunning beauty.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Avarelle ran her mending and seaming business repairing cloaks, tents, and robes. Her skills were practical, and her work was done to last, not to appear pretty. Because of that, she did not take any orders to mend fanciful garments. Avarelle did not charge much for her services and accepted barter or food. Her shop was located on Easting Lane in the southeastern part of Hultail, across from Harrafe Orlimburs abode."
