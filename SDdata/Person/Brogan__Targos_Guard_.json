He was armed with a dagger and a battleaxe.\nIn the , the town of Targos became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legions surprise attacks teleported a troop of goblins into the Targos docks, where Brogan was among the guards. He managed to trap a large group of goblins in one of the warehouses and attempted to get aid from one of the adventuring bands hired by Targos, the Iron Collar Band, who were more interested in drinking at the The Salty Dog Tavern than working. Time was of the essence for Brogan, as if the goblins started a fire in the warehouse, the resulting blaze would consume the entire docks area."
