        "mainbody": "'''Velmos Sonder''' was the [[Sorlyn]] [[priest]] who founded the [[Abbey of Highsong]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Velmos was ambitious and cunning, capable of trespassing into shops and writing derogatory songs to achieve his goals.",
        "Abilities": "Velmos was able to cast the ''[[singing stone]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Possessions": "Velmos was the last known owner of [[Wythyndle's Round Book]], an exceedingly rare holy book of the ''Lord of All Songs''.",
        "History": "While visiting a shop on the [[Way of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1355 DR]], Velmos noticed the ''Round Book'' for sale. Lacking funds to purchase the tome, he hid in the shop at night and copied the ''singing stone'' spell from it. He then used the spell to produce and sell stones containing humorous and irreverent songs targeting local nobility and merchants.\n\nThe stones earned Velmos enough money to buy the ''Book that Sings'' and found the [[Abbey of Highsong]]. He lived there until his murder, three years after the abbey opened."
