==Description==
Due to its unique mutation, Omaranthax's eyes had become mouths and its fanged mouth was filled with a single red eye. Its gray body was covered in blue [[spellscar]]s. When seriously injured, Omaranthax transformed further and its eye extended out of its body on a stalk.
==Personality==
Like others of its kind, Omaranthax was self-obsessed and dishonest. It had a habit of referring to itself in the third person. It was also single-minded about its transformation.
==Relationships==
Ormaranthax had been a foe of [[Keepers of the Celestian Order|the Keepers of the Celestian Order]] for many years.
It was served by many [[foulspawn]] minions and a trio of warped [[gas spore]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Omaranthax performed a ritual using the magic of the [[Plaguewrought Land]] in an attempt to gain power. However, it lost control of the ritual and violently mutated into a new form. Ormaranthax was pursued into the [[Thornwood]] by the Black Arrows, a group of the [[Keepers of the Celestian Order]], where it barricaded itself into a cave along with its minions.
