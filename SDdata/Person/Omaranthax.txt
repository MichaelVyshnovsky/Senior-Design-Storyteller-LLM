Omaranthax was a mutated beholder that lived in a cave in the Thornwood by the Lake of Steam in the late 15 century DR.
Due to its unique mutation, Omaranthaxs eyes had become mouths and its fanged mouth was filled with a single red eye. Its gray body was covered in blue spellscars. When seriously injured, Omaranthax transformed further and its eye extended out of its body on a stalk.
Like others of its kind, Omaranthax was self-obsessed and dishonest. It had a habit of referring to itself in the third person. It was also single-minded about its transformation.
Ormaranthax had been a foe of the Keepers of the Celestian Order for many years.
It was served by many foulspawn minions and a trio of warped gas spores.
In the , Omaranthax performed a ritual using the magic of the Plaguewrought Land in an attempt to gain power. However, it lost control of the ritual and violently mutated into a new form. Ormaranthax was pursued into the Thornwood by the Black Arrows, a group of the Keepers of the Celestian Order, where it barricaded itself into a cave along with its minions.
