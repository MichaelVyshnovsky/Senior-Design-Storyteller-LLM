'''Alton Vandree''' was a [[drow]] cobbler in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a member of [[House Vandree]] and one of [[Houndaer Tuin'Tarl]] and [[Syrzan]]'s rebel group.

==History==
During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Alton joined Houndaer's group desiring to start a slave revolt. [[Vuzlyn Freth]] and Alton Vandree were, among others, summoned to [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] and [[Ryld Argith]] as they might be some of the males they needed to find.
