        "mainbody": "'''The Curse of Irphong''' can refer to either of the two creatures that inhabited the lair underneath Irphong island in the Nelanther Isles.\n\nA [[dragon turtle]] was the first to be known by this name. It was one of the oldest and largest of its kind. It was slain by a [[kraken]] in [[1363 DR]].\n\nThe kraken appropriated the dragonâ€™s name and treasures. It now attack ships that pass through the region, especially those that travel alone and at night.",
        "Lair": "Its lair is accessed through an underwater entrance in a sea-cove entrance on the north side of the island. The 1500 foot underwater passage leads to the center of the island, where the treasure is kept."
