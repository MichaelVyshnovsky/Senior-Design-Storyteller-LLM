        "mainbody": "'''Rax''' was a powerful [[shadow mastiff]] summoned by [[Variance Amatick]] in [[1373 DR]] to attack the people of [[Yhaunn]].",
        "Description": "Rax was exceptionally large and powerful among shadow mastiffs, the size of a [[warhorse]] and covered in scars.",
        "History": "On the night of the new moon on [[Eleasis 15]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[shade]] [[priestess]] of [[Shar]] Variance Amatick summoned 18 shadow mastiffs and then pulled forth Rax. Invoking ancient contracts, she offered Rax command of half of the mastiffs and the mission of hunting and killing in the [[Stiltways]] while she attacked [[Moonshadow Hall]] and her unwilling servant [[Keph Thingoleir]] stole ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]'' from [[Fourstaves House]]. In exchange, the lordly mastiff would be allowed to hunt at will in [[Faer√ªn]] for three nights.\n\nRax agreed to the terms and took the other shadow mastiffs on a hunt in the Stiltways, distracting the city guard and preventing them from defending Moonshadow hall when it too was attacked. Realizing the threat the great beast and its pack posed, [[Feena Archwood]] and Keph forced Variance to banish them early, returning them to their home plane."
