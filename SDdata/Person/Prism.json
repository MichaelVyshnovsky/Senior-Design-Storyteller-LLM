        "mainbody": "Prism was a great artist who worked himself to death creating a monument for a woman he loved, yet had only ever glimpsed once.\nCirca 1368 DR, the sculptor had stolen emeralds, and retreated close to the Nashkel mines. There was a bounty on his head, and was being sought out by the bounty hunter, Greywolf. The legendary artist knew he did not have long, and began to use potions of speed to speed up his work. This work was of a statue of a woman he had fallen for. He took the emeralds, and he believed they would represent the spark in her eyes. Prism said that he had only seen her once in the outskirts of Evereska but did not dare to address her."
