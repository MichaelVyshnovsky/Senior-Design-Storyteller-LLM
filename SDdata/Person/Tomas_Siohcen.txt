'''Tomas Siohcen''' was a cleric of [[Cyric]] who joined the [[Unseen]] in [[Waterdeep]] by the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Tomas was a loyal devotee of Cyric. He hated the goddess [[Talona]] and her followers for the suffering of his past. He believed that the Unseen incarnated the teachings of Cyric and enthusiastically supported their plots against the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].

==History==
Tomas was a slave of a [[Calishite]] follower of [[Talona]] in his past.

When he arrived in Waterdeep, he decided to start a project to erect a [[cathedral]] to Cyric atop [[Mount Waterdeep]]. He joined the Unseen for this objective.
