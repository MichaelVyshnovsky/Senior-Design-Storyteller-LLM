Tomas Siohcen was a cleric of Cyric who joined the Unseen in Waterdeep by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Tomas was a loyal devotee of Cyric. He hated the goddess Talona and her followers for the suffering of his past. He believed that the Unseen incarnated the teachings of Cyric and enthusiastically supported their plots against the Lords of Waterdeep.
Tomas was a slave of a Calishite follower of Talona in his past.
When he arrived in Waterdeep, he decided to start a project to erect a cathedral to Cyric atop Mount Waterdeep. He joined the Unseen for this objective.
