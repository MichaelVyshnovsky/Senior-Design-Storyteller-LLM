'''Sittl''' was a [[malenti]] spy of [[Ascarle]].

==Personality==
Sittl was a great actor, always with the facade of a happy and generous person. In truth, he was a sadist with a bloodlust.

==Activities==
Sittl posed as an [[aquatic elf]] [[ranger]] and normally wandered the [[Trackless Sea]] with fellow sea elf ranger [[Xzorsh]].

==History==
He assisted Xzorsh in [[1361 DR]] to help the ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'', which was pursued by the [[Kraken Society]] of [[Ascarle]] and by [[Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]].

Xzorsh searched for him and finally found Sittl on [[Ruathym]] under the ''[[charm]]'' of a [[kelpie]]. Sittl tried to kill Xzorsh but failed and they reconciled. Sittl said that he had been captured by a group of [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]]. However, the [[drow]] wizard [[Liriel Baenre]] read Sittl's mind and saw strange images, starting to suspect the truth. After some investigation, she deducted the truth of Sittl.

At last, Xzorsh found Sittl inside Ascarle with the [[Northlander]] traitor [[Dragmar]] and finally Sittl revealed the truth to his presumed friend. However, Xzorsh easily killed Sittl.

==Relationships==
[[Xzorsh]], a [[sea elf]], was Sittl's presumed partner and close friend until the elf discovered Sittl's allegiance to [[Ascarle]].
