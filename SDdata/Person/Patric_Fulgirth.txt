'''Patric Fulgirth''' was a ruler of the kingdom of [[Doegan]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

He was an idle ruler who cared not for the needs of the people. Formerly a powerful nation, Doegan fell into decline under his dereliction of duty. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] sought to depose Fulgirth, and thought this would be an easy task.
