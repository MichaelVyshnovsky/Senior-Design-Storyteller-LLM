Patric Fulgirth was a ruler of the kingdom of Doegan in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
He was an idle ruler who cared not for the needs of the people. Formerly a powerful nation, Doegan fell into decline under his dereliction of duty. The leader of the Legendary Campaign sought to depose Fulgirth, and thought this would be an easy task.
