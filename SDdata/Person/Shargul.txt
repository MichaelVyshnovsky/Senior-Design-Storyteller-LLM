Shargul, also known as the Runner of the Rocks, was a notorious pirate of the Sword Coast North. He was dead by 1370 DR.
A legend told that his treasure, a hoard of gems, was concealed within the walls of the Seven Sails Inn in Luskan, protected from magical scrying and guarded by animated skeletal hands.
