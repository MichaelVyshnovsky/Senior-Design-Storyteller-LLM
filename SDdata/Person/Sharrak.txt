'''Sharrak''' was a [[winged kobold]] member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Moonsea]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
Sharrak had two heads who had different personalities that always disagreed. The left head was proud and haughty, while the right was cunning and cruel.

==History==
Sharrak was sent by his masters to infiltrate the [[Claws of Tiamat]], a bandit group led by [[Jeralla]]. He performed so well that he soon become the group's second-in-command. When the Claws decided to have a meeting with another bandit group, the [[Gray Patriots]], in order to negotiate an alliance, Sharrak decided that the time was the right to kill the heretic Jeralla and her minions.

Thus he alerted his masters to send an [[orc]] war band to kill all present. However, while waiting for the right time, an adventuring party hired to clean the [[Iron Route]] of outlaws arrived and ruined his plans. In the ensuing fighting, Sharrak was killed.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|14-15}}
