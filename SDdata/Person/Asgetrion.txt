'''Asgetrion the Learned''' was a local sage who lived in [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Activities==
He was perhaps the most accomplished expert on the study of [[gorgon]]s in all of Cormyr. Due to the nature of his expertise, Asgetrion owned what some have called the largest collection of scrolls of ''[[protection against petrification]]'' in the realm. He would never sell his scrolls, but instead hoarded them jealously, sharing only his knowledge for a price. It was this knowledge that brought adventurers and War Mages alike to his home from all over Cormyr and beyond.<ref>Eric Haddock (1994). ''Cormyr''. (TSR. Inc). p. ''20''. ISBN 1-56076-818-5
