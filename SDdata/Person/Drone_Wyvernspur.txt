Drone Wyvernspur, called affectionately Uncle Drone by most of his younger kinfolk, was the archmage of Redstone Castle, the ancestral home of the Wyvernspur family. 
Drone had all the typical male Wyvernspur features blue eyes, beak-nosed, and black hair. But as an old man, his hair had streaks of white, and he shuffled about with enough wrinkles for two and seemed in Giogioni Wyvernspurs words to have been visited by old age twice over, unlike his cousin Dorath Wyvernspur, the family matriarch.
He was one of Giogioni Wyvernspurs favorite relatives and had a fondness for his cat Spot, even though both caused him some grey hairs over the years.
