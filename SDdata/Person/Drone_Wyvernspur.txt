'''Drone Wyvernspur''', called affectionately '''Uncle Drone''' by most of his younger kinfolk, was the archmage of [[Redstone Castle]], the ancestral home of the [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur family]]. 

==Description==
Drone had all the typical male Wyvernspur features: blue eyes, beak-nosed, and black hair. But as an old man, his hair had streaks of white, and he shuffled about with enough wrinkles for two and seemed in [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]]'s words to have been visited by old age twice over, unlike his cousin [[Dorath Wyvernspur]], the family matriarch.

==Relationships==
He was one of Giogioni Wyvernspur's favorite relatives and had a fondness for his cat [[Spot (cat)|Spot]], even though both caused him some grey hairs over the years.<ref>
