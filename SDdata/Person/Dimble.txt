'''Dimble''' was a [[rock gnome]] living in [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Dimble was responsible for producing the oil that fueled Gnomengarde's lanterns and inventions. He operated the complicated contraption that pressed Gnomengarde's unique red mushrooms to extract their oil. From each big specimen, Dimble could extract four flasks of oil.

==Abilities==
Like all the other [[gnome]]s in Gnomengarde, Dimble had some training as a [[wizard]] in addition to his innate abilities. In combat, he preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.
