'''Ihanora the Merciful''' was the [[chosen]] of [[Auril]] who led a crusade against others in [[the North]] in the name of her goddess during the late 11{{th}} and early 12{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Activities==
Ihanora traveled alongside a savage band of [[frost giant]]s and [[yeti]]s, that fought alongside [[polar worm]]s and even [[white dragon]]s, striking fear into the hearts of mortals. They assaulted anyone that attempted to seek refuge from the bitter cold of the North or that sought to negate the harsh effects it caused.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1099}}, Ihanora crafted the ''[[Snow Maiden's Reaver]]'', that could turn any being it struck into solid ice.

She was finally defeated nearly a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1108}}, by the [[Red Mask Brigade]] led by the infamous [[Bitter Harley]].
