==Description==
Falura was a young, dark-skinned hin woman with curly black hair and dark brown eyes.

==History==
During her time in Lady Jannath's estate, Falura strived to be a chef. She was supervised by Marjoram, who ran his kitchen with an iron fist, demanding perfection. Falura managed to serve [[Firelia Jannath]]'s guests raw dishes, struggled with knife-work, and complained over the amount of mouths she had to cook for.
