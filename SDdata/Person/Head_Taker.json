He proudly displayed their mummified shrunken heads across a leather baldric strapped to his muscular chest.\nThe Head Taker served as the bodyguard and personal assassin of Nar-Aidiya. Given the fierce reputation of both Nar-Aidiya and the Brotherhood of the True Flame, the Head Taker reveled in his position because it allowed him to display his violent nature. \nThe Head Taker wielded a pair of incredibly powerful magical great scimitars called Widowmaker and Firefiend. Despite the size of the weapons, he wielded both one-handed. The claws on his remaining two hands were coated with a deadly contact poison."
