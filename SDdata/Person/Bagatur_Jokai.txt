Bagatur Jokai was a commander within the Grand Army of the Tuigan during the mid 14 century DR.
Bagatur commanded an arban—a military unit of ten men—within the army. The portion of the army under Prince Hubadais command were camped outside of the ruins of Kushk when a large purple dragon attacked them. Bagatur and his men were sent to explore the city, where they stumbled upon an ancient scroll detaling a portion of the dragons history. His arban was attacked on the return trip. Bagatur perished from wounds suffered at the hands of a blood-sucking jiki-ketsu-gaki.
