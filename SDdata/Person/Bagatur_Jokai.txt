'''Bagatur Jokai''' was a commander within the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] during the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Bagatur commanded an ''arban''—a military unit of ten men—within the army. The portion of the army under Prince [[Hubadai Khahan|Hubadai]]'s command were camped outside of the ruins of [[Kushk]] when a large purple [[dragon]] attacked them. Bagatur and his men were sent to explore the city, where they stumbled upon an ancient [[scroll]] detaling a portion of the dragon's history. His ''arban'' was attacked on the return trip. Bagatur perished from wounds suffered at the hands of a blood-sucking [[gaki|jiki-ketsu-gaki]].
