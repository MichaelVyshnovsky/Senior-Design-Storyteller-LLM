'''Aldreth Fireshaar''' was a peculiar [[mage]] that lived in [[Telflamm]] during the mid—14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She dwelled within a barge, docked at the harbor, that was well-protected by a number of [[gargoyle]]s.{{Cite dragon/213/Aldreth Fireshar}}

Aldreth could always be found with a floating, [[magic]]al skull that accompanied her wherever she traveled.

==Personality==
She was knowing for being rather unprincipled and particularly conspicuous in her actions.

==Appearance==
While Aldreth's eyes were normally greyish-green in color, they turned a vibrant orange when she became excitable.

She wore an abundant amount of jewelry.

==Powers==
Among Aldreth's repertoire was a spell of her own creation, one that granted her dominion over a number of [[goblin]]s at the same time.

==History==
Aldreth studied the [[arcane]] arts in the [[Lake of Steam region]] of [[South Faerûn|southern Faerûn]] before journeying to [[Thay]]. Though there was no firm evidence, the [[Harper]] mage [[Sunder Snowhand]] believed she delved into some Thayan crypts and even stole an ''[[evermagic]]'' during that time.

At some point she became involved in a [[goblin]] attack that raided a [[Zhentarim]] caravan. It was believed by [[Elminster Aumar]] that the attack was made to recover a [[scroll]] that pointed to the location of a ''[[sky chariot]]'' from the ancient realm of [[Mourativi Teshy Mir]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors originating in the kingdom of [[Impiltur]] said that Aldreth had ties to pirates that sailed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], while others told tale that she had invested into a [[thaedar]].

Stories heard in the [[Sword and Horn]] tavern alluded to her involvement with [[spelljammer|ships]] that could sail in the sky and travel to other worlds.
