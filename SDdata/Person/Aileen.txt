Aileen was one of the Sisters of Synnoria, warriors of the Llewyrr.
When she went on scouting missions, Aileen covered her shining armor with a woolen tunic of green, earthen tones and changed her lance for a bow, along with a slim sword.
As part of the Sisters of Synnoria, she fought under Brigits command and had Maura and Carina as companions. Her steed was called Osprey.
Aileen took part in the battle of Corwell Road, where she was wounded by one of the Bloodriders. Although she was still affected by her wound, she served as a messenger in the defense of Caer Corwell.
Aileen was finally slain in the battle of Caer Corwell in 1345 DR slain by the same rider that had wounded her before.
