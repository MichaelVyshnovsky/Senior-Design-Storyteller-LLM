Elastul Raurym was the marchion of Mirabar. The Hammers were his personal bodyguard.
Elastul was fat, and had a red beard.
Elastul was often devising devious plots, but these were rarely put into practice. He was also known to be quite lustful with a love of money and decadent pleasures. Marchion Raurym made a point of traveling south to warmer climes before the onset of winter, to negotiate trade agreements with rulers who had many luxuries, but little metal.
