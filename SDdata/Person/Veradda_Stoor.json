        "mainbody": "Veradda Stoor was a famous treasure hunter in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the the 1480s DR, Veradda was hunting treasure left in secret stores by the Cult of the Dragon. Members of the Cult had hidden their treasure after they failed to summon Tiamat. Veradda had discovered the location of five such stores, in the Greypeak Mountains.\nIn order to access these treasure stores, Veradda hired adventurers to help her. She agreed to meet them near Parnast. Before they could arrive, Veradda was killed by giants who also wanted the treasure. They stole her notes and pursued the caches themselves. The adventurers arrived too late to save Veradda, but they found second copies of her notes and also went treasure hunting."
