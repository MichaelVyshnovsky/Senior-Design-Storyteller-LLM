Noohar Serelim was a merchant that operated on the Sword Coast as of the late 15 century DR.
Noohar was one of the most articulate persons in Faerun. He was a fantastic orator and talked non-stop, even though he seldom had something to say.
At some point in the 1480s DR, Noohar and his brother Selvek were transporting some exquisite wooden carvings made by their people via a great caravan that, unknown to them, was full of Cult of the Dragon agents carrying treasures for use in a ritual involving their goddess Tiamat.
