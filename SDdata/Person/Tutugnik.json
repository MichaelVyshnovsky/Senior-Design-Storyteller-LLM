After brief fighting, Tutugnik and most of the goblinoids were captured by the [[drow]].\n\n[[Ravel Xorlarrin]] offered Tutugnik the chance to remain leader of his tribe under the drow's authority, but the bugbear understood that they would all only be slaves and refused. Ravel quickly killed Tutugnik and decided to purge all of Tutugnik's loyalists while the others would live as slaves."
