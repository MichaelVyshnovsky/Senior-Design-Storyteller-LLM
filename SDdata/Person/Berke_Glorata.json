        "Possessions": "Berke had a [[short sword]] to defend himself with, and kept a ''[[potion of plant control]]'' as well. As an agent of the organization, he also carried a ''[[Harper pin (lesser)|Harper pin]]''.",
        "Activities": "He was placed at Thistleflame by the Harpers in order to keep an eye on Lord Thistle's work as Registrant General of [[Cormyr]], as his work directly affected [[Adventurer|adventuring]] companies in the realm, including those that were Harpers.",
        "Relationships": "Berke was good friends with the handyman [[Borin Woodbracer]], but unintentionally developed a rivalry with [[Kaleb Fleetwing]] and [[Travis Ormaster]] by being too handsome for his own good.
