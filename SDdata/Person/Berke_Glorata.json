        "mainbody": "Berke Glorata was a Harper agent who operated undercover as a gardener for Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep in 1369 DR.\nBerke was a handsome young man with a square jaw.\nHe had a friendly and approachable personality, and a love of nature and the outdoors.\nBerke had a short sword to defend himself with, and kept a potion of plant control as well. As an agent of the organization, he also carried a Harper pin.\nHe was placed at Thistleflame by the Harpers in order to keep an eye on Lord Thistles work as Registrant General of Cormyr, as his work directly affected adventuring companies in the realm, including those that were Harpers.\nBerke was good friends with the handyman Borin Woodbracer, but unintentionally developed a rivalry with Kaleb Fleetwing and Travis Ormaster by being too handsome for his own good. His friendly manner and good looks made him uncommonly popular with most of the women who worked at Thistleflame."
