        "mainbody": "Felyndiira Shinarrvha, also known as Mad Money, was a drow matron mother of House Catanzaro, powerful mage, and leader of her own criminal organization in the 14 century DR.\nFelyndiira was a stunningly attractive drow woman (other drow would describe her as having cold beauty), with a height of . She dressed quite lavishly in elaborate robes and silks as befitting her wealth and station, and had a strong fondness for fancy hats.\nIn her youth, Felyndiira was idealistic, optimistic, wilful, and curious. She had a strong sense of nobility and obligation towards other drow.\nAs an adult, she utterly lost her idealism and developed a hatred for the drow as a whole. She became highly paranoid, distrusting, and misanthropic, and as a rule assumed that everyone was a selfish deviant and out to get her. She would never sit with her back to a living creature, and usually reacted very hostilely – verbally or physically – to anyone who entered her personal space, killing a large number of suitors and business associates over time.\nMad Money was well-educated and trained in reading, writing, etiquette, ancient history, herbalism, religion, and spellcraft.\nShe had strong magic resistance and infravision as a drow, and in addition to her powerful and versatile mage spells could cast some innate spells including dancing lights, faerie fire, darkness, darkness, know alignment, and detect magic.\nFelyndiira typically wore bracers of defense AC 2 and a ring of spell turning, carried a staff of the magi and wand of fireballs, and wore her dagger in a wrist sheathe. A less obvious accoutrement was a ring of wishes she had as a navel piercing.\nFelyndiira was highly distrusting and misanthropic, with a fearsome and lethal reputation that precluded most relationships. Despite this, she had a strong friendship with the illithid operator of the Think Easy, Brikhalna Ipprszhen, though they always seemed to be be loudly arguing when seen together in public. She adopted Grayshivnarien Taliain into her crime family, and worked alongside low-level gangsters such as Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn and Vikhrumn Coll. Her closest companions were actually a group of wolverines that she polymorphed into drow forms, and used as a lethal \"Wolverine Security Shield\".\nthumb|280px|Mad Money meeting her tiresomely eccentric goons at the Think Easy.\nFelyndiira was the eldest daughter and heir of House Catanzaro, and studied magic in Menzoberranzan. She had an idealistic and grand belief that she could singlehandedly fix the self-sabotaging and destructive aspects of drow society and lead her people into a better age.\nAs she matured, the arbitrary, cruel, and capricious nature of drow culture constantly ruined her plans and destroyed her sense of nobility and optimism. She came to believe that the drow people were irredeemably foul and a threat to all that was good in the world, and changed her goals to instead eradicate her own people for the good of the Underdark. She seized control of her House, took the name \"Mad Money\", and used its resources to build her own extensive criminal organization. Her ultimate goal was to antagonize and disrupt other criminal groups so that drow civilization would eventually be wiped away in a great, all-destroying war erupting from the criminal underworld. Mad Money eventually became known on the surface of Faerûn through the investigations of Gerald of Riveyra, Elliot of Kness, and the Forthright Band of Investigators."
