A less obvious accoutrement was a ''[[ring of wishes]]'' she had as a navel piercing.",
        "Relationships": "Felyndiira was highly distrusting and misanthropic, with a fearsome and lethal reputation that precluded most relationships. Despite this, she had a strong friendship with the [[illithid]] operator of the [[Think Easy]], [[Brikhalna Ipprszhen]], though they always seemed to be be loudly arguing when seen together in public. She adopted [[Gray'shivnarien Taliain]] into her crime family, and worked alongside low-level gangsters such as [[Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn]] and [[Vikhrumn Coll]]. Her closest companions were actually a group of [[wolverine]]s that she ''[[Polymorph (spell)|polymorphed]]'' into drow forms, and used as a lethal \"Wolverine Security Shield\".",
        "History": "[[File:Underdark Gangsters.png|thumb|280px|''Mad Money meeting her tiresomely eccentric goons at the Think Easy.'']]\nFelyndiira was the eldest daughter and heir of House Catanzaro, and studied magic in [[Menzoberranzan]]. She had an idealistic and grand belief that she could singlehandedly fix the self-sabotaging and destructive aspects of drow society and lead her people into a better age.\n\nAs she matured, the arbitrary, cruel, and capricious nature of drow culture constantly ruined her plans and destroyed her sense of nobility and optimism. She came to believe that the drow people were irredeemably foul and a threat to all that was good in the world, and changed her goals to instead eradicate her own people for the good of the Underdark. She seized control of her House, took the name \"Mad Money\", and used its resources to build her own extensive criminal organization. Her ultimate goal was to antagonize and disrupt other criminal groups so that drow civilization would eventually be wiped away in a great, all-destroying war erupting from the criminal underworld. Mad Money eventually became known on the surface of [[Faerûn]] through the investigations of [[Gerald of Riveyra]], [[Elliot of Kness]], and the [[Forthright Band of Investigators]]."
