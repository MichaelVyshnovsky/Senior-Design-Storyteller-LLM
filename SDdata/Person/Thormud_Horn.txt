'''Thormud Horn''' was a [[dwarven]] [[geomancer]] in southern [[Mulhorand]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He retained the services of [[Kiril Duskmourn]] as a bodyguard.{{cite book/Darkvision|29-32|4}}

==Appearance==
His voice was low and melodious.

==Personality==
He didn't tell jokes often enough for his bodyguard's taste.{{cite book/Darkvision|35|4}}
He considered himself to be in the last fifty years of his career.{{cite book/Darkvision|130-131|14}}

==Abilities==
Thormud's ability to summon beings of the earth was awesome, allowing him to call upon [[granite destrier]]s{{cite book/Darkvision|35-37|4}} and even elemental nobles such as [[Prince Monolith]]. He often used divination rituals. He was also capable of opening gaps in magically protected stone, even where [[Prince Monolith]] had failed. His spells were granted by a divine source, and thus vulnerable to abilities that targetted those.

==Possessions==
Thormud often employed a white selenite rod for divinations and summonings. He was also the owner of [[the Finger Defiant]].

==Relationships==
Thormud's bodyguard was [[Kiril Duskmourn]]. His familiar was [[Xet]]. He shared some bond with Prince Monolith.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1374}}, Thormud Horn discovered a disruption of the telluric currents beneath the earth getting in the way of his prognostications. He tracked that disruption south to Durpar,{{cite book/Darkvision|70-75|8}} one of them dropped a fragment of [[plangent crystal]] after its destruction.{{cite book/Darkvision|81-82|8}} After his next prognostication, he summoned the elemental lord Prince Monolith since a [[demon]] was summoned in response to his divinations.{{cite book/Darkvision|137-138|14}}

The earth elemental convinced him to turn north, where he had determined the ultimate source of that corrupting influence was found.{{cite book/Darkvision|142-143|14}} Thormud soon discovered he was afflicted during one of his attempts at discerning the nature of the corruption;{{cite book/Darkvision|179-182|19}} while seeking shelter from a dust storm in [[Al Qahara]], his bodyguard learned that the dwarf had been cursed.{{cite book/Darkvision|224-225|24}} Soon after, they arrived at the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], with the geomancer barely alive at that point. After identifying the structure, the dwarf bade Kiril and Monolith go into the structure without him, so that they may break the evil influence that was killing him. He sent Xet with them.{{cite book/Darkvision|223-229|24}}

After sealing [[Pandorym]], Prince Monolith quickly took the dwarf back to civilization, looking for a healer.{{cite book/Darkvision|308|31}} He also parted ways with Kiril, to whom he gifted Xet.{{cite book/Stardeep|109|10}} They wouldn't travel together until {{yearlink|1385}}, when together with her and his old-time familiar, they went to the [[Vilhon Reach]]. There, they purchased access to [[Laerakond|Returned Abeir]] from the [[Chalk Destrier]].{{cite book/Plague of Spells|161}}{{cite book/Plague of Spells|264-265}}
