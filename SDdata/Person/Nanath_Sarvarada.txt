Mroarild Sarvarada was a traveling merchant, performer, gemcutter, hedge wizard, and the adoptive mother of Taline Telgara around the turn of the 10 century DR.
As a merchant, she sold minor articles of clothing and jewelry his routine performanced included juggling, dancing, acrobatics, and short comedy stints with her husband. They adopted Taline Telgara, an orphan from near Everlund, whose family had been killed in an orcish raid she soon joined their performances. By Talines second season as a performer, both Nanath and her husband were adamant they only perform as a family, never alone. She was a hedge wizard in addition to her other talents, and she taught Taline what little magic she knew early on. Eventually Nanath retired from the road, and became a gemcutter for a coster based in Athkatla, together with her husband, Mroarild Sarvarada.
