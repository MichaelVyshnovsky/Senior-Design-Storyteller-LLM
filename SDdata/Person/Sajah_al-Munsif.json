        "mainbody": "Caliph Sajah al-Munsif, also called the Most Revered Mother or the Quiet Caliph, was the ruler of Hudid in the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR. She was the only female ruler of a Pantheist city for a generation.\nSajah rarely spoke or acted directly, preferring to let her actions speak for her and leading by example. When she did speak she enjoyed using parables that were often confusing at first but ultimately related important truths leading to Pantheist enlightenment.\nSajahs resolve prevented the spread of Balanite heresy along the coast. She often donned her chador and walked freely among the people of Hudid, noting their needs so she could better lead them.\nSajah served the Pantheist League as a representative to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz. Impressed with both her wit and wisdom, the Grand Caliph appointed her caliph of Hudid in 1357 DR. The League Conclave approved of the Grand Caliphs decision.\nSajah had twin daughters, Inara and Jinara, during her tenure in Huzuz."
