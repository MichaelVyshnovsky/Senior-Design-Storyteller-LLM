Iycanth, also known as Iycanth the Mad, was a crazed wizard working for the Bhaalspawn Abazigal during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Despite his insanity, he could cast the most difficult wizard spells.
Iycanth owned a scroll of reversal, needed to access Abazigals lair.
Iycanth was the most favored wizard and servant of Abazigal. He conducted several experiments on orb creatures, which resembled eyeballs. The wizard planned on using these creations to develop an army for Abazigal.
One day, he captured a gauth beholder, who took an interest in his eyes. Iycanth tried to harvest its eye, but it jumped into a pool to the east of his base, and disappeared.
