        "mainbody": "rgus Skeel was a vampire spawn in service to the necromancer Ularan Mortus. He spied for the Cult of Myrkul in Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.\nSkeel resided in the cellar of an abandoned hut on the outskirts of town, together with a horde of ghouls under his command. He frequently spied on the Stonehill Inn. Because of his sunlight hypersensitivity, Skeel almost never came out of hiding in daylight, and when he did, he covered his skin with heavy clothing to protect himself.\nCirca 1491 DR, following the attacks by the white dragon Cryovain in the surrounding region, Argus Skeel came to Phandalin from the Mere of Dead Men. He pretended to be a prospector, but he was actually a spy for the Myrkul cultists.\nAt some point, a group of adventurers from Leilon, who had previously thwarted the plans of the Myrkul followers, arrived in Phandalin to pick up supplies for Leilon. Before they could leave town, Skeel and his ghouls confronted them. At the same time, Velleen Firecrow, a spy for the rivaling Cult of Talos, confronted the adventurers with her kobolds, resulting in a three-sided battle."
