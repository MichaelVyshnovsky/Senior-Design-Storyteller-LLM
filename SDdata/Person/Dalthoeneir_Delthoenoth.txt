Dalthoeneir Delthoenoth was a male moon elf wilder and a younger member of the Kaliesherai, an association of psionic elves in Evereska.
Around 1374 DR, Dalthoeneir Delthoenoth had emerged as the leader of an expansionist contingent within the Kaliesherai, younger members who desired contact with non-elven psionicists, and perhaps even allow them to join the Kaliesherai.
