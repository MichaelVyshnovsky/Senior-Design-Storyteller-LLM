'''Dalthoeneir Delthoenoth''' was a male [[moon elf]] [[wilder]] and a younger member of the [[Kaliesh'erai]], an association of [[psionic]] [[elves]] in [[Evereska]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

==History==
Around [[1374 DR]], Dalthoeneir Delthoenoth had emerged as the leader of an expansionist contingent within the Kaliesh'erai, younger members who desired contact with non-elven psionicists, and perhaps even allow them to join the Kaliesh'erai.
