In the , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legions surprise attacks herded a troop of goblins by magical means through underground tunnels into the Targos docks, where Crandall was guarding the Dualdons Wake â€“ one of the more important naval vessels, and a way to escape death were the town to fall.
