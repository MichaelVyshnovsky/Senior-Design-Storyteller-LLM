'''Crandall''' was a member of the [[Targos Guard]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I was assigned to protect the dock to [[Dualdon's Wake]] and to keep it from the [[goblin]]s. Unless reinforcements come soon, however, I fear a band of goblins will chance upon me first.''|Crandall}}

==Description==
Crandall was a red-headed [[human]] man who was clad in Targos Guard's [[leather armor]] and was armed with a [[spear]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. One of the Legion's surprise attacks herded a troop of goblins by magical means through underground tunnels into the Targos docks, where Crandall was guarding the ''Dualdon's Wake'' â€“ one of the more important naval vessels, and a way to escape death were the town to fall. Crandall made an insightful assertion that someone within Targos's walls was conspiring with the Legion.
