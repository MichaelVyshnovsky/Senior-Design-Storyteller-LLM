Livikus Arthantar was a cleric of Bane and member of the Zhentarim in the early 1370s DR.
In 1374 DR, Livikus and his bodyguard Xeldar Orsalyn were sent by his masters to the Xûl-Jarak citadel in Thar to pay homage to the new orog warlord Thrull. In truth, his mission was to determine if Thrull could truly unite all Thar and ally with Zhentil Keep in an attack on Melvaunt.
Livikus truly believed in the possibility that Zhentil Keep would rule all of north Faerûn.
