'''Thergod''' was a [[scro]] who worked for the [[Zhentilar]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Thergod was known to be rather ill-mannered, though he inspired great confidence in his troops and had a good sense of tactics. He was prone to planning ambushes against his opponents.

==Possessions==
Thergod was known to possess a set of ''+2'' [[plate mail]] armor, a [[shield]], and a ''+2'' [[broad sword]].

==History==
At some point during the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, Thergod's [[spelljammer]] crashed near the [[Darkhold]]. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Zhentarim. He became the leader of a patrol known as the [[Blood Axe Smashers]], consisting of sixteen [[ogre]]s and three [[hill giant]]s.
