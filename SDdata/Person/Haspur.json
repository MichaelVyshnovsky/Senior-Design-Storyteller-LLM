        "Activities": "He was a seer or prophet who would go into a trance, and was believed to be slightly deranged.",
        "History": "Before [[Nightal]] of the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Haspur prophesied the [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'' would be discovered again in the following year. While he was agitated during his trance, he awoke remembering nothing and could offer no clarification.\n\nHe was partially correct in his forecast, if off by a few years. The ring was later uncovered in a [[temple of Ubtao|temple]] in [[Mezro]], by [[Artus Cimber]] in [[1362 DR]]."
