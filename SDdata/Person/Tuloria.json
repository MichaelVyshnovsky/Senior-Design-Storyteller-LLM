        "Description": "Tuloria was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone and green eyes. Her red hair was kept long and she wore quality embroidered clothes of maroon color, decorated with images of [[Firebird|firebirds]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Tuloria was among those Baldurians who sought entrance into the Upper City. To gain entrance, Tuloria sold most everything she owned, hoping to be able to find a rental room in the safety of the city's upper-crust neighborhood."
