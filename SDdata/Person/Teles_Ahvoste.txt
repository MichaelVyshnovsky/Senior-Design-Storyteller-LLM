'''Teles Ahvoste''' was an [[archmage]] from [[Halruaa]] and one of the Great Readers that served [[Candlekeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Born in the great magocracy of [[Halruaa]] in the [[Shining South]], Teles has always maintained a strong understanding and familiarity with [[arcane magic]]. Because of this relationship, Teles has always been well aware of the inherent dangers that accompanied the use of magic.

While Teles always thought of Halruaa as home, the learned sage always sought new opportunities to learn more about arcane secrets that were hidden within the world. The Great Reader believed that scholars of [[Faer√ªn]] were tasked by the gods to uncover these secrets.

==Abilities==
The Great Reader was considered to be Candlekeep's foremost authority on [[arcane magic]], with specific expertise in [[Item enchantment|magical items]], all manner of [[curse]]s, and [[the Weave]] itself. While quite knowledgeable, Teles was prone to meander and blather a bit in conversation, in order to ensure every subject was explained just right.
