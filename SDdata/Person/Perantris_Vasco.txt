Perantris Vasco was a musician and a member of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in 1479 DR.
Perantris was a skinny human male with with large eyes and little to none facial hair.
In 1479 DR, Perantris was recruited by Bazamarl to join his cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame. He was in charge of providing music when the cult met.
When a band of adventurers that were sent by Halagothra the Healer to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, killed both Bazalmarl and the Firebird, Perantris fled in panic, avoiding being killed by the adventurers.
