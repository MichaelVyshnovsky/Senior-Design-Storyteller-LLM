'''Oedachlo''' was a powerful [[mind flayer]] [[wizard]] until a [[human]] wizard magically imprisoned him under the sands of [[Anauroch]]. However, in [[1358 DR]], a [[Zhentarim]] expedition freed him. Oedachlo remained deeply hidden while exploring the modern [[Realms]]. His goal was to find the human wizard or his descendants and enact his revenge.
