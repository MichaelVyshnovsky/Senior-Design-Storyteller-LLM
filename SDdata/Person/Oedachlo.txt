Oedachlo was a powerful mind flayer wizard until a human wizard magically imprisoned him under the sands of Anauroch. However, in 1358 DR, a Zhentarim expedition freed him. Oedachlo remained deeply hidden while exploring the modern Realms. His goal was to find the human wizard or his descendants and enact his revenge.
