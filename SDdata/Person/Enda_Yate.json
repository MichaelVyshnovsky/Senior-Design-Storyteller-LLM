        "mainbody": "Enda Yate was a halfling rogue in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.\nIn 1479 DR, having heard about a ruby-eyed-statue somewhere inside Undermountain, Enda agreed to join the doomed Rutherford Urmbrusks party. When Rutherford disappeared, the halfling abandoned her companions in search of the statue, discovering the statues general location. So Enda went back to the surface and recruited a large number of ruffians to help her in her treasure hunt.\nSo, leading a large group, Enda ventured back into the dungeon. However they met a large tribe of lizardfolk followers of Sessinnek and in the fighting most of the Endas fellows were killed or captured.\nEnda herself and a few of her ruffians hid in a room, praying for their lives with only Enda without any great injures.\nCategoryRogues\nCategoryHalflings\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nth5iyxytjzsb4w5se33u4s2f8etdfmi"
