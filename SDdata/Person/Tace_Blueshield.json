        "mainbody": "'''Tace Blueshield''' was a [[shield dwarf]] [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in the late 15th century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Tace was grim and disciplined and had a drill-sergeant attitude towards both her men and to the monks. She did not appreciate people telling her how to do her work. She hated speaking about her past. Tace believed that the monastery could only be in danger from external attacks, never believing in an internal threat. She acted only with solid proof, but with proof she would quickly arrest and interrogate anyone",
        "Activities": "Tace's duty was to command the few military forces of the monastery."
