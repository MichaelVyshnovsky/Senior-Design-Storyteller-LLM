'''Maerlyn''' was a [[human]] apprentice who specialized in absorption of arcane powers, memories, and souls.

==History==
It wass rumored that [[Halaster Blackcloak]] took her on due to her resistance to the [[Spellplague]] that he somehow knew was coming. She was consumed by her own experiments when she summoned a lifedrinker [[specter]] that slowly drained away her memories and life-force. She existed only as a [[ghost]] for a long period of time and was tortured by said specter until "freed" by adventurers.
