Budd was a young dimwitted korobokuru adventurer from the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur, active in the late 14 century DR.
Like other korobokuru, Budd had the ability to see in the dark at the distance of . He knew how to brew intoxicating beverages as well as to cleave the heads of monsters with his trusted battleaxe.
Budd wore a set of garuda-hide armor and defended himself with a huge simple wooden shield. A necklace of gnasher teeth with a large garnet dangled off his neck.
In the late 14 century DR, Budd, along with his two equally dimwitted friends, tiger katanga Rowr and saru named Crash, embarked on their adventures within the dangerous Living Jungle. As the civilized inhabitants of the jungle were menaced by the evil spider katanga â€“ the Mother of a Thousand Young, the trio of dunces found themselves in the quicksand-filled areas of the jungles not far from the Fire Mountain. Rowr found himself half-submerged in the sands that were slowly swallowing the tiger youth. The trio came up with an ingenious rescue plan. Rowr conjured a patch of web between two jungle trees, while his companions used vines and the web to try and pull the tiger katanga out of the quicksand. Budd and Crash fashioned a giant slingshot out of the magical webs and trees with Rowr attached to the middle of the makeshift device. The duo pulled the sling all the way down to the sand level with vines, about to launch their friend from the quicksand into the air, equally if not a more dangerous situation. As Budd and his saru companion were ready to release the slingshot, a group of Malatran heroes stumbled across the trio as they headed to slay the Mother of a Thousand Young.
It was unknown whether the heroes successfully stopped the duo from killing their friend attempting to rescue him, helped the trio come up with a better plan, or simply stood back and watched the show.
