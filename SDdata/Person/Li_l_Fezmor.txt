==Description==
Fezmor was a young [[human]] girl with a light skin tone, light brown eyes, and chestnut hair. She wore a garb dyed with the Guild's green color and had a business-like demeanor.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Li'l Fezmor was a part of a street urchin gang led by [[Osgur Hallorn|Osgur "Fetcher" Hallorn]]. When the man disappeared following a guild war breaking out between [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] and the [[Stone Lord]], Fetcher's Brats were taken in by the Guild and given shelter in the Guildhall. [[Sticky Dondo]] took on the role of leader among the kids and Li'l Fezmor kept herself busy, sending clients to Sticky, who sold all sorts of "acquired" goods.
