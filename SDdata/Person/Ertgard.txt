{{Quote|Death, we meet at last!|Ertgard}}

==Description==
In his old age, he appeared withered and frail. He had become [[deaf]] and his eyes had turned cloudy and weak.

==Personality==
Ertgard actively wanted to die an honorable warrior's death.

==Possessions==
His weapon of choice was the [[greataxe]]. He had gathered up much of the treasure he had found in Grimskalle in a hoard, which contained several thousand [[currency|coins]], a statuette of [[Thrym]], and an ''[[alchemy jug]]''.

==History==
Ertgard was once a member of Queen [[Vassavicken]]'s clan, which had built the fortress of Grimskalle to begin with. As of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, he was the sole surviving clan member and had sworn his service to Grimskalle's new ruler, the [[deity|goddess]] Auril. The Frostmaiden had little use for him, and simply bade him guard the fortress to the best of his abilities.
