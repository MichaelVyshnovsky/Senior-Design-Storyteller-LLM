Ertgard was a frost giant in the service of Auril the Frostmaiden in the fortress of Grimskalle on the isle of Solstice in the Sea of Moving Ice.
In his old age, he appeared withered and frail. He had become deaf and his eyes had turned cloudy and weak.
Ertgard actively wanted to die an honorable warriors death.
His weapon of choice was the greataxe. He had gathered up much of the treasure he had found in Grimskalle in a hoard, which contained several thousand coins, a statuette of Thrym, and an alchemy jug.
Ertgard was once a member of Queen Vassavickens clan, which had built the fortress of Grimskalle to begin with. As of the , he was the sole surviving clan member and had sworn his service to Grimskalles new ruler, the goddess Auril. The Frostmaiden had little use for him, and simply bade him guard the fortress to the best of his abilities.
