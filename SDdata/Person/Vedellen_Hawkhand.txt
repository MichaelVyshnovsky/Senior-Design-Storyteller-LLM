Vedellen Hawkhand was a young half-elven ranger inhabiting Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Vedellen was a secret agent for the Harpers who preferred to enjoy adventures in the wild than actually pursue any of their lofty goals. He adventured with bands heading out from Waterdeep and reported their activities back to the Harpers to ensure they were not working against their plans. Vedellen would travel north to Silverymoon to seek more experienced rangers to further his education when needed.
