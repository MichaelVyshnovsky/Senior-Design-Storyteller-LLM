'''Tyndal''' was a character of legend who inspired the name of the town of [[Daggerford]]. The legend stated that the boy fought off a tribe of [[lizardfolk]] using a mere [[dagger]].

==Possessions==
He was given the [[flame tongue]] sword ''[[Lawflame]]'' as a gift by [[Elorfindar Floshin]].

==History==
Tyndal was the son of a merchant. In the {{YearlinkName|931}}, he traveled north from [[Baldur's Gate]] with a merchant caravan. He killed a group of lizardfolk while armed only with a dagger.

Once he grew to adulthood, he married the local lord's daughter and appointed himself as duke. As a duke, he then founded Daggerford by building it on a castle ruin. Tyndal's bridge, the bridge visitors to Daggerford from the south needed to cross, was named after him.

These stories were not mere legend but historical facts according to [[Darfin Floshin]] who was already alive when these events happened.
