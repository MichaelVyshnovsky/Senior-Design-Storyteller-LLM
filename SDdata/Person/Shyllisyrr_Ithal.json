        "mainbody": "'''Shyllisyrr Ithal''' was an [[elf]] from the [[Forest of Tethir]] who became the wife of  chieftain [[Corin Ithal]] of [[Clan Ithal]].",
        "Relationships": "Shyllisyrr was married to Corin Ithal, and the two of them had several [[half-elven]] children together. One of her daughters was named [[Varytha Ithal|Varytha]].",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-190}}, Corin and Shyllisyrr's daughter Varytha vanished, and neither [[ranger]]s nor [[mage]]s could track her whereabouts. Unbeknownst to them, she had fled [[human]] life to live among her mother's people to learn their ways.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-189}}, Shyllisyrr was killed by a [[snake]] bite while on a picnic with her remaining children. The elves of her tribe demanded that the Ithal family's guard be executed for not protecting her from the snake, but Corin refused to honor their request, believing the man to be innocent of any wrongdoing. After six years of tense diplomacy with the elves, Chief Corin finally gave in and turned the elderly fellow clansman over to the elves, in hopes that this would serve to maintain the alliance with the clans and the elves. However, it caused the other [[human]] clans to turn against Clan Ithal."
