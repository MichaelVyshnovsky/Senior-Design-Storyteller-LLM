Portis Alvermantle was a Sembite merchant and spy who operated in Cormyr in 1369 DR.
He was a stout man with a red face, soft hands, and rich clothes, marking him as a prosperous merchant.
Portis was a nervous man, but had a good sense for when he was in danger.
In the , he spied on the Dragoneye Dealing Coster and the Seven Suns Trading Coster in Cormyr on behalf of the rival merchants of Yhaunn. On the way home along the Hullack Trail he stopped at the Journeys Rest inn during a storm, only to intuit something was terribly wrong despite the friendly atmosphere provided by the beautiful innkeepers Ryanna and Moria. Though he did not know precisely what the danger was, he packed up and left that night despite the weather. This saved him from being devoured by innkeepers, who were both secretly vampires.
