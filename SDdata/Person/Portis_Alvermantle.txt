'''Portis Alvermantle''' was a [[Sembite]] merchant and spy who operated in [[Cormyr]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
He was a stout man with a red face, soft hands, and rich clothes, marking him as a prosperous merchant.

==Personality==
Portis was a nervous man, but had a good sense for when he was in danger.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he spied on the [[Dragoneye Dealing Coster]] and the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] in Cormyr on behalf of the rival merchants of [[Yhaunn]]. On the way home along the [[Hullack Trail]] he stopped at the [[Journey's Rest]] inn during a storm, only to intuit something was terribly wrong despite the friendly atmosphere provided by the beautiful innkeepers [[Ryanna]] and [[Moria]]. Though he did not know precisely what the danger was, he packed up and left that night despite the weather. This saved him from being devoured by innkeepers, who were both secretly [[vampire]]s.
