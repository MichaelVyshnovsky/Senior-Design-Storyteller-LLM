        "History": "Minder was a female [[dwarf]] who joined [[Dwalimar Omen]] in his mission to acquire the [[Astrolabe of Nimbral]]. However, in the battle against the [[crystalgriff]] guardian of the object, Minder fell. Omen managed to transfer Minder's spirit into the body of an [[iron golem]]. Minder followed loyally Omen in all his adventures.\n\nLater, her original golem body was destroyed but its head remained intact and was incorporated to a steel statue by a [[dwarven]] artisan nicknamed Forgemaster, as part of a plan by Lord Los of the [[Akri]] tribe to create an army of living statues. Unknown to them, Minder's spirit remained in the head and took control of the body, helping her friends escape. Minder's second body was stronger and much more anatomically correct than the first.<ref>{{Cite comic/Cat Logic}}",

        "Powers": "As a golem, Minder had no need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Normally she fought with her bare hands."
