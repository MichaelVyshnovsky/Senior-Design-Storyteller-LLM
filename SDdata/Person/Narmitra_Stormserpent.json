        "mainbody": "'''Narmitra Stormserpent''' was a noble in [[Cormyr]] and a lady of the [[Stormserpent]] noble house in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She was too old for the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]]'s tastes; given her son Marlin was extremely unlikely to be under 50 years old and wasn't even the oldest son, she was almost certainly 65 years old or more.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|114-116|12}}",
        "Personality": "There was nothing about the nobility of Suzail that Narmitra liked.",

Marlin suspected his mother liked him the best of all his siblings, and was more than a little afraid of her; they sparred verbally with regularity.",
        "History": "After the death of her husband, Narmitra Stormserpent had Mhedarlakh Stormserpent take the place of head of the House, though she continued to wield the real power in the family; she did so to spare her son Marlin the unenviable tasks of the Head. At some point, Marlin got her promise she wouldn't go into certain towers of [[Stormserpent Towers]]. She did go in anyway for a time, but observed nothing of interest in there.\n\nNarmitra Stormserpent was at Stormserpent Towers during the attack by [[Immaero Sraunter]] and [[Manshoon]], in which they filled the towers with deadly gas to kill all possible witnesses of their treasons involving her son Marlin, as there were [[War Wizards]] trying to gain entry by force; unaware of the attack, she threatened her servants with all sorts of barbaric fates if a single agent of the Crown got in. Though Manshoon believed she was sure to perish,{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|137-138|15}}"
