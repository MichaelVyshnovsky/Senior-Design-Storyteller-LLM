'''Wynn Freshwater''' was a street vendor from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Newspaper says Steel Watch production is increasing. Doesn't seem to help Lord Gortash keep ruffians like you off the streets.''|Wynn Freshwater}}

==Description==
Wynn was a [[high elven]] woman with fair sun-kissed skin, blue eyes, and straight red hair. While working, Wynn wore a simple white blouse and a brown [[leather]] [[corset]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Wynn Freshwater could often be found manning her produce stall in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate, on a moot near [[The Glitter Gala]] jewelry shop. Unlike many fellow citizens of the Gate, Wynn thought articles published by the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]]'' to be nothing but fluff pieces penned to uplift the new [[Lord Gortash]]. She did not approve of the new army of [[steel watchers]], thinking them a menace.
