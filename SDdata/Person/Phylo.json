        "mainbody": "'''Phylo''' was the original [[myconid]] leader of the [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Phylo \"ruled\" the Neverlight Grove alone for a long time. When the sovereign [[Basidia]] and its two circles arrived in the Grove, Phylo was happy to have someone to share the burdens of leadership with.\n\nHowever, two years later, when [[Zuggtmoy]] arrived in the Grove ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], she understood that the best strategy was to first corrupt Phylo and in order to gain control of the whole community. Phylo was easily corrupted and started a subtle battle of ideologies during the daily melding to convert all circle leaders to Zuggtmoy. Step by step, most of the myconids succumbed to madness; only Basidia and its followers resisted.",
        "Personality": "Crazed, Phylo dreamed all day about a mushroom paradise.",
        "Relationship": "Since its arrival, Phylo was best friends with Basidia until the arrival of Zuggtmoy."
