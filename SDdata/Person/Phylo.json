        "mainbody": "Phylo was the original myconid leader of the Neverlight Grove in the late 15 century DR.\nPhylo \"ruled\" the Neverlight Grove alone for a long time. When the sovereign Basidia and its two circles arrived in the Grove, Phylo was happy to have someone to share the burdens of leadership with.\nHowever, two years later, when Zuggtmoy arrived in the Grove circa 1486 DR, she understood that the best strategy was to first corrupt Phylo and in order to gain control of the whole community. Phylo was easily corrupted and started a subtle battle of ideologies during the daily melding to convert all circle leaders to Zuggtmoy. Step by step, most of the myconids succumbed to madness only Basidia and its followers resisted.\nCrazed, Phylo dreamed all day about a mushroom paradise.\nSince its arrival, Phylo was best friends with Basidia until the arrival of Zuggtmoy."
