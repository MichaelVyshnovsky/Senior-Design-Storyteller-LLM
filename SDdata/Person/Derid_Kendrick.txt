'''King Derid Kendrick''' was an heir of [[Alicia Kendrick]] and, as of [[1479 DR]], was the nominal King of all the [[Moonshae Isles]] although he only directly controlled [[Alaron]].  Even though his power was limited he still commanded the respect of most [[Ffolk]] and [[Northlander]]s in the isles and hoped to reassert his authority over the entire archipelago.[[Shawn Merwin]]"Backdrop:  Moonshae Isles" ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]] '' #196. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, November, 2011. 

==History==
In [[1489 DR]] he hoped to foster an alliance with the [[dwarven]] clans of the [[Fairheight Mountains]], but was frequently rejected. Around this time he also sought to reclaim the ruins of the small Ffolk city [[Caer Corwell]] and rebuild it as an embassy to the kingdom of [[Sarifal]], whose territory the city was then under, but struggled to obtain permission from their ruler Lady [[Ordalf]].

==Relationships==
Derid's youngest son, [[Owaren Kendrick|Owaren]], was kidnapped by Lady [[Erliza Daressin]] and taken to [[Snowdown]] as a hostage.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|13}}
