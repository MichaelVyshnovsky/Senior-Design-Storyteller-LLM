[[The Guild]] thinks they're the only thieves and swindlers in town â€“ but we're going to show them what happens when you get complacent.|Aideen Ni Chuirc}}",
        "Description": "Aideen was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone and mousy-gray hair in a bun. As a mage, Aideen wore a simple [[robe]] of gray and carried an [[enchanted]] ''+2 [[staff]]''.",
        "Abilities": "Some of the [[spell]]s Aideen could weave included ''[[blur]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[firebolt]]'', and ''[[lightning bolt]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Aideen Ni Chuirc and the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting them against the Guild and its leader, [[Ninefingers]]. Aideen worked with a local criminal not affiliated with the Guild, [[Brinks]] to pull the heist off. But the Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of Aideen. Her band survived and relocated to a new lair, of which Brinks was informed via a letter scribbled on a [[beer]] advertisement pamphlet. Unbeknownst to Aideen, one of her men was a traitor. The [[bard]] [[Hiero Lue]] uncovered the secret stash where Aideen hid the loot, including the Guild's [[coin]], and sent a note to Ninefingers, informing the Guild of the Dead Eyes' lair and the hidden stash's location. The hiding spot was unknown to even Aideen's own sister, Maggie Ni Chuirc. It was unknown if Aideen and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldur's Gate."
