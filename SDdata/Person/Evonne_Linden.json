        "mainbody": "'''Evonne Linden''' was a royal-born daughter of the [[Tethyr]]ian [[Rhindaun Dynasty]] who orchestrated a series of plots to seize power in her kingdom during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "In her youth, Evonne wore her blonde hair ringlets. She said to have a smile that evoked the likeness of a fiend. \n\nShe had a series of unique, branching scars that extended from her hand up her arm.",
        "Personality": "Evonne was brilliant and determined, if not calculating and manipulative woman. She had a seemingly near-infinite amount of patience to see her plans to fruition. For a time Evonne became fascinated with the macabre, possibly due to her own profound fear of her own death.\n\nShe also had a singular hatred of [[elves]], particularly those lead by [[Avalor]], Treespeaker of the [[Wealdath]].\n\nHer favorite colors were red and gold.",
        "Activities": "Evonne had a keen eye for politics and was more than capable of out-maneuvering some of the most conniving minds of Tethyr.\n\nShe was also a skilled [[spellcaster]], and studied all manner of dark and esoteric magic. She was particularly interested in the magic of the ancient [[sarrukh]], who were known to consume the flesh of \"lesser\" intelligent species. To better understand the sarrukh's secretsâ€•and perhaps overcome the inconvenience of mortality.",
        "Abilities": "Through her studies into the arcane, Evonne's developed techniques to manipulate the 'miniscule building blocks' that made up the fabric of existence, that led her to create [[clones]] of other people [[blood magic|using their blood]].<ref group=\"note\">While this is fact not explicitly stated, there are numerous signs that allude to it, including: Evonne's unique scars, the research conducted in [[Vankila Slab]], Evonne and Tresco's research and activities in Chult, the \"husk-making machine\" found near the Tethyrian colony, and her continued search for the blood of the Captive.",
        "Relationships": "Evonne married an influential Tethyrian named [[Garion Linden]]. Garion had a devoted following, who offered their allegiance to Evonne after his untimely death. Together they had two children, [[Teague Linden|Teague]] and [[Ysabel Linden|Ysabel]].",
        "History": "{{Quote|Did I ever tell you that it was Evonne who gave me the idea of exploring Chult in the first place? She had done all sorts of research on the sarrukh and said they had wealth beyond imagination in the ruins of their...|[[Tresco Maynard]], [[1479 DR]].}}\n\nDuring her sister's reign, Evonne made a failed attempt to seize the throne of Tethyr for herself.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, [[elves]] from the [[Wealdath]] slaughtered many Tethyrian nobles, including Evonne's son Teague, at a gathering at the [[Winter Palace]], in what came to be known as the [[Children's Massacre]]. Evonne and Anais were en route to the palace, but were waylaid in [[Celleu]] due to a sudden and unnatural fog. Unfortunately, Evonne was still killed that night, targeted a group of assassins in what was declared by the Tethyrian [[Inquiry]] as a profound irony.\n\nFollowing her apparent death, Evonne's followers took to calling themselves the [[Branch of Linden]]. They attempted to continue their lady's quest to reclaim the throne from Queen Anais, but were ultimately routed by the Tethyrian military.\n\nEvonne Linden did not die however. Her consciousness was transferred into the body of her daughter Ysabel, who was one of three survivors of the Children's Massacre. It was not entirely clear how exactly Evonne transferred herself into her daughter's body, save for the fact it occurred on the same night as the massacre.\n\nEvonne then spent the next decade living as her daughter. Ysabel was named the ward of her son's former tutor, [[Tresco Maynard]], who readily accepted the late Evonne's tremendous wealth. While it appeared that Ysabel began her arcane studies under Tresco, His contributions were but a mere, trifling addition to everything Evonne had previously achieved before.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Evonne manipulated Tresco and the one-time \"Hero of the Realm\" Declan Cardew into launching an expedition to the ruined Sarrukh city of [[Hisari]] in Chult. She enticed them with the political power of Tethyr, allowing the duo to plot a coup against Queen Anais by means of Cardew's marriage to \"Ysabel\", with Tresco Maynard serving as the true ruler of the realm. Evonne manipulated them into retrieving an elixer made from the blood of a being known as \"[[the Captive]]\". While Cardew and Tresco managed to enter into the lost city, they ultimately stole the wrong artifact.\n\nFortunately, a group of [[adventurer]]s hired by Evonne's Avalor of the Wealdath arrived at Tresco's estate to 'save' Ysabel from marrying the lecherous Cardew. Seeing her opportunity, Evonne quickly manipulated the adventurers into serving her instead."
