==Description==
She wore a simple, stitched leather dress that she kept cinched with a cloth belt.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the cultists of the Absolute launched a terrible raid against the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, killing many and capturing others. It was around that time that Gribbo caught her very own "Pigeon", a rather famous bard by the name of [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Gribbo had Volo perform recitations in front of her fellow Absolutists. For the occasion he crafted an ode to their leader, [[Dror Ragzlin]].

Gribbo knew she should hand over her prized "Pidge" to her superior [[Minthara Baenre]], but was so captivated by his charm she could not bring herself to let him go.
