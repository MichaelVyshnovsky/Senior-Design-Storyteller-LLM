He enjoyed proposing drinking contests in which he was unbeatable.\nJeremi owned a few stalls in the Grand Bazaar and a small storage facility in the Warehouse District of Huzuz. His main shop, however, was located in the Court District. His vineyards were located south of the city proper.\nHis wines and brandies were popular among the wealthy of Huzuz. Much of this was due to Jeremis dealings with winemaker genies.\nJeremi excelled at making Heart of Wine."
