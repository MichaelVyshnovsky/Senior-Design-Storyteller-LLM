        "mainbody": "he Green Hag of Lizard Marsh was a green hag witch and a cookbook author of the Witchs Brew Cookbook, who feuded with a lizardman shaman Uzzak-Szalzik from a neighboring village in the Lizard Marsh of the Sword Coast circa 1372 DR.\nThe old and wrinkled Green Hag of Lizard Marsh had a jovial personality (for a hag), who reserved malice for her enemies and foes, preferring to sell her foul potions and concoctions to occasional visitors. She had thick, greasy black hair and yellow stained rotting teeth.\nThe Green Hag of Lizard Marsh had many arcane talents. She knew how to brew a wide variety of foul-smelling and exotic potions, including a concoction that was applied topically, instead of being ingested, and acted as a polymorph spell. Another putrid potion could be sprayed on the target to have the  polymorph dispelled.\nStinkweed, stinkberry, toad tongues, snake stomaches, and extra spicy bat dung were among ingredients she used to make her potions.\nThe Green Hag commanded an army of swamp frogs. She also was highly proficient in divination and often peeked into the future. When her predictions were off by a day or so, the hag showed mild annoyance and impatience. \nBy 1372 DR, the Green Hag was already quite old. The witch lived alone, surrounded only by creatures of the swamps whom she befriended. At some point in her past a warrior snuck into the Green Hags home in attempts to kill and rob the old witch. But a falcon saw the intruder and woke the witch with a loud screech. Thankful for saving her life, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh polymorphed the falcon into a young human lass she named Soliana. The new daughter was the apple of hags eye. Even though the falcon-maid liked her human existence, the Green Hag crafted an enchanted necklace for her daughter. If Soliana were to ever grow tired of being a human she only needed to whisper \"rablak\" three times into the necklace to be returned to her original feathered form. They were close. She spent countless nights at the swamp listening to toads croak, brushing the childs long brown locks. The hairbrush was a sentimental trinket that the hags daughter gifted to her. In the green-hag fashion, it was made of bones and ribs of various marsh creatures. Eventually, the daughter matured and ran away with a handsome knight to the city of Baldurs Gate.\nSometime after the daughters departure, the Green Hag came to feud with a fellow shaman and witch doctor from a lizardfolk tribe nearby. Uzzak-Szalzik harbored deep resentment for the hag for some undisclosed reasons, and in 1372 DR, he snuck into her lair and stole the daughters hairbrush with a tangle of hags own hair. Using that, the shaman crafted an effigy to place a nasty curse on the hag. Under the effigys dark magics, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh erupted is annoying rashes as if bitten by fire ants, and more importantly, she lost her precious heirloom. She attempted to retrieve the stolen items by sending an army of swamp frog into the lizard village but the amphibians never returned and the hag could smell the odor of fried frog across the bog.\nThis theft came to the attention of Redeye, a lizardfolk who wanted to fold the Uzzak-Szalziks tribe under his rule. The humanoid lizard came across the Hero of Daggerford who was investigating strange occurrences in the environs of Daggerford. Seizing this opportunity, Redeye asked the Hero to stash a stolen egg of the lizardfolk tribe black dragon patron in the chieftain hut. To do so, the Hero was sent to the hag, who also sought revenge on the lizard shaman and retrieval of her precious hairbrush. The Green Hag of Lizard Marsh placed a powerful polymorph spell on the Hero and their allies to help them sneak into the lizard territory. Subsequently, the Hero stole the hags effigy and Uzzak-Szalziks knife, allowing her to counter-curse her vile opponent with a nasty case of dragon lice. When the Green Hag received her hairbrush, she was overjoyed, clutching the item to her chest and tearing up."
