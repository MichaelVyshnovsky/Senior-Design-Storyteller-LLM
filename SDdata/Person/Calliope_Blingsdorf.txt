'''Calliope Blingsdorf''' was a musician and minstrel, part of the [[Circus of the Last Days]] troupe in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Calliope was a male [[gnome]] with pale skin and bright pink hair. His eyes had different colors: the left one was bright blue, and the right one was pale brown. His colorful appearance was made even more outrageous by a bright [[bard]]ic attire.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Circus of the Last Days returned from the [[Feywild]] and opened its gates to the inhabitants of the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Calliope Blingsdorf entertained guests by performing alongside [[Viola Silvertongue]], a fellow carnie whom he believed to be a true wonder. Calliope was present at the circus when it was revealed that the [[Cult of the Absolute]] murdered one of the troupe â€“ the clown called [[Dribbles]], and replaced him with a murderous
[[doppelganger]].
