'''Lady Alauthshaee''' was an [[elf]] notorious for both her wealth and the manner of her death.{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|15}}

==History==
Over her lifetime, Lady Alauthshaee married no less six husbands, and outlived each and every one of them. Each time, she took her deceased husband's fortune as her own, growing extremely wealthy in the processed. For this reason, she was infamous to the elves.

Yet it was one of those she scornfully rejected, the elven [[mage]] [[Ilthuryn]], who outlived her. Enraged, Ilthuryn attacked her with his [[spell]]s as she rode in her flying carriage. It reportedly crashed to earth within [[Dead Tree Hollow]] in [[the Vast]]. Ilthuryn then used his magic to bury the carriage, the guards, and Alauthshaee herself alive. The spell-battle left a [[dead-magic zone]] over the whole valley. This took place a very long time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but still within [[elf|elven]] memory.

By [[1370 DR]], the flying carriage of Lady Alauthshaee and the great treasures within still had not been found, but were thought to be buried or sunk in a pond somewhere in Dead Tree Hollow. It also possibly still contained the bodies of Alauthshaee and her guards. [[Adventurer]]s occasionally came to search the valley for it.

==Personality==
Alauthshaee was described as haughty.

==Possessions==
Via her husbands, Alauthshaee had acquired extreme wealth. She owned a magical flying carriage of elven design dating back to ancient times, which on its last journey was packed with her [[jewelry]] and [[silk]] gowns decorated with [[gems]].
