'''Xorla Djannas''' was fervent champion of the deity [[Cyric]] who resided in [[Waterdeep]] in in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
A native of the southern region of [[Tethyr]], Xorla moved to Waterdeep with her master [[Selphar Thynn]]. When Thynn died in a tavern brawl, Xorla was left alone in the city. It was not too long after this that she found her true calling. During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], she was witness to the ascension of Cyric into godhood. It was then that she devoted her life to the Dark Sun and became an agent of his church.
