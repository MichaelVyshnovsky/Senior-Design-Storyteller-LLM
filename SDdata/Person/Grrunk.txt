'''Grrunk''' was a [[taer]] adept in [[1372 DR]].
 
==History==
The [[yochlol]] [[Savera]] recruited Grrunk and her group of taers as minions in her mission to [[Sildëyuir]]'s [[Night Realm]] citadel. Grrunk and her fellows accompanied Savera in infiltrating the mercenary army gathered by the [[nilshai]] [[sorcerer]] [[Tolg'byri]]. Thanks to her disguise, Savera took Tolg'byri by surprise, killing it. Afterward, Savera took control of the group.

Soon after, Grrunk found the footprints of someone else inside the citadel and with her fellows started searching for the intruder (revealed to be the [[deathlock]] [[Kyjal Stardancer]]).
