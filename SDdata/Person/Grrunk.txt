Grrunk was a taer adept in 1372 DR.
The yochlol Savera recruited Grrunk and her group of taers as minions in her mission to SildÃ«yuirs Night Realm citadel. Grrunk and her fellows accompanied Savera in infiltrating the mercenary army gathered by the nilshai sorcerer Tolgbyri. Thanks to her disguise, Savera took Tolgbyri by surprise, killing it. Afterward, Savera took control of the group.
Soon after, Grrunk found the footprints of someone else inside the citadel and with her fellows started searching for the intruder (revealed to be the deathlock Kyjal Stardancer).
