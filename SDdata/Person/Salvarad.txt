'''Salvarad''' was a [[cleric]] and one of the [[Wearers of Purple]] in the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He was a member of the ruling council and a supposed [[cleric]] of [[Talos]]. In truth, both [[Shar]] and [[Cyric]] granted him spells, thanks to a peculiar and unique relationship that Salvarad had with these two deities. He professed reverence for Talos, but didn't truly worship him. He usually resided in [[Saerloon]] in [[Sembia]].

He was one of the leaders who ordered the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]] in [[1357 DR]].
