Salvarad was a cleric and one of the Wearers of Purple in the Cult of the Dragon in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a member of the ruling council and a supposed cleric of Talos. In truth, both Shar and Cyric granted him spells, thanks to a peculiar and unique relationship that Salvarad had with these two deities. He professed reverence for Talos, but didnt truly worship him. He usually resided in Saerloon in Sembia.
He was one of the leaders who ordered the hunt for Shandril Shessair in 1357 DR.
