Endrith Vallivoe was a shopkeeper in Red Larch and a contact of the Harpers during the Elemental Evil crisis.
The shopkeeper was a shy and scuttling little man. He was an attentive watcher and listener and knew most of the villages rumors. He was a friend to the Harpers and was a useful and loyal informant for them.
Endrith ran a shop in the village.
Around 1491 DR, Endrith was a caravan leader in his youth until he retired to open a shop.
