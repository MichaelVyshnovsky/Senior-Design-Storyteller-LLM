        "mainbody": "'''Harhoring''' was an exiled [[archdevil]] in the mid-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Due to the constant agony, he was seldom in a less than savage mood, and he was constantly on the lookout for someone looking to take meals from him; the food was the only thing that kept the worms' pain at bay.",
        "Description": "He had the face of a goat with alert, intelligent eyes; his horns, as tall as men, were decorated with [[spinagon]] skulls. His belly was bloated with worms made of his own flesh, which he could never slay, only have slain by others.",
        "Abilities": "Harhoring had a number of spells, such as [[bloodhook]] and [[burning talons]]. Other spells of his own included a spell of acidic talons, and one which created explosive stars made of long thorns. The mark of Asmodeus prevented him from summoning other devils.",
        "Relationships": "[[Asmodeus]] had been so displeased with Harhoring that he had condemned him to a cursed form, in which he was in constant agony, though he was allowed to roam free. [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]] saw him as a rival and used him as an obstacle.",
        "History": "At some point, Asmodeus had exiled Harhoring while allowing him some freedom, instead turning his flesh against him as a punishment by making his flesh be constantly eaten by worms made of his own body, which he could never slay on his own.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1372}}, [[Elminster Aumar]], while a prisoner of the [[devil]] [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]], was sought by [[the Simbul]], who meant to rescue him from [[Avernus]]. Nergal transformed [[Elminster]] into a piece of bone, and used him as bait to lead her to Harhoring.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|271-272|18}} The archdevil was, at the moment, trying to eat a dragon.\n\nWhen she arrived, Harhoring used his spells to try and slay her, but failed, and was slain in turn."
