        "mainbody": "Harhoring was an exiled archdevil in the mid-late 14 century DR.\nDue to the constant agony, he was seldom in a less than savage mood, and he was constantly on the lookout for someone looking to take meals from him the food was the only thing that kept the worms pain at bay.\nHe had the face of a goat with alert, intelligent eyes his horns, as tall as men, were decorated with spinagon skulls. His belly was bloated with worms made of his own flesh, which he could never slay, only have slain by others.\nHarhoring had a number of spells, such as bloodhook and burning talons. Other spells of his own included a spell of acidic talons, and one which created explosive stars made of long thorns. The mark of Asmodeus prevented him from summoning other devils.\nAsmodeus had been so displeased with Harhoring that he had condemned him to a cursed form, in which he was in constant agony, though he was allowed to roam free. Nergal saw him as a rival and used him as an obstacle.\nAt some point, Asmodeus had exiled Harhoring while allowing him some freedom, instead turning his flesh against him as a punishment by making his flesh be constantly eaten by worms made of his own body, which he could never slay on his own.\nIn , Elminster Aumar, while a prisoner of the devil Nergal, was sought by the Simbul, who meant to rescue him from Avernus. Nergal transformed Elminster into a piece of bone, and used him as bait to lead her to Harhoring. The archdevil was, at the moment, trying to eat a dragon.\nWhen she arrived, Harhoring used his spells to try and slay her, but failed, and was slain in turn."
