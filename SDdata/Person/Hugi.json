He was even willing to wager three [[magic item]]s if the adventurers would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a ''[[Svartalfheim cloak]]'', a ''[[horn of Valhalla]]'', and a great war [[maul]] known as ''[[Grungir's hammer]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21,25,36}}\n\nHugi, who was visiting Okalnir at the time, was chosen as the giant champion of running. In the third of four tests, he competed to be the first to reach the far end of the hall, with various tables and other furniture being pushed out of the way to accommodate the test.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|22}}"
