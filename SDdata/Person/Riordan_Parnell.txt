'''Riordan Parnell''' was a [[half-elf]] [[bard]] and a member of [[Spysong]]. He was one of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s companions in the [[War of Bloodstone]], and was instrumental to the defeat of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]].

==Description==
Riordan was lithe of build and was regarded as quite handsome. He looked remarkably young for his age, even for a half-elf.

==Abilities==
Riordan was an extraordinary bard, whose ability to coax the truth from reluctant witnesses helped him greatly in his position as a scout for Spysong.<ref> 

His favorite instrument was the [[lute]]. When playing and singing, Riordan slipped [[enchantment]]s into his tunes and used the magic of his voice—the gift of true bards—to manipulate the mood of his subjects, convincing them of his friendship and trustworthiness.

==Activities==

In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Riordan helped to found Spysong, an intelligence organization working on behalf of the kingdom of [[Damara]]. With the help of some fifteen bards around [[Vaasa]] and Damara, Riordan coded important messages for Gareth Dragonsbane into songs. Also, Riordan had a mobile strike force of 100 fighters under his exclusive command, which included 20 [[centaur]] cavalrymen.

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the aged Riordan was the sole leader of Spysong, but was then working against the ruler of Damara, King [[Yarin Frostmantle]], whom he suspected of having assassinated the last of Gareth Dragonsbane's descendants.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

==Relationships==
Riordan was close allies with King Gareth Dragonsbane of Damara and their fellow adventuring companions from before Gareth became king.
