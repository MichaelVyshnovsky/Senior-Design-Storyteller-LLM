'''Lyonarth''', who was called '''the Winter Sphinx''' because of his white fur, was a King of [[Westgate]].

==Activities==
Lyonarth was an [[androsphinx]] who slew King [[Myntharan]] of Westgate in the {{YearlinkName|480}}. In [[615 DR]], he was seduced by the [[lamia noble]] [[Nessmara]], who used illusions to imitate a [[gynosphinx]] and ruled Westgate alongside him. This continued until the [[616 DR|the following year]], when the wizard known as the [[Handweaver]] arrived in Westgate and dispelled her illusions. Lyonarth and Nessmara then fought to the death, and the throne was granted to the Handweaver's apprentice, [[Farnath Ilistar I|Farnath]].
