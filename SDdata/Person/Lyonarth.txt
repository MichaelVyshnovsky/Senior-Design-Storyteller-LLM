Lyonarth, who was called the Winter Sphinx because of his white fur, was a King of Westgate.
Lyonarth was an androsphinx who slew King Myntharan of Westgate in the . In 615 DR, he was seduced by the lamia noble Nessmara, who used illusions to imitate a gynosphinx and ruled Westgate alongside him. This continued until the the following year, when the wizard known as the Handweaver arrived in Westgate and dispelled her illusions. Lyonarth and Nessmara then fought to the death, and the throne was granted to the Handweavers apprentice, Farnath.
