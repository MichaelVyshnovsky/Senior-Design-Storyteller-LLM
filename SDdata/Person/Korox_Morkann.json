        "mainbody": "King '''Korox Morkann''' was the monarch of the small kingdom of [[Erlkazar]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]].",
        "Description": "Korox Morkann was a [[human]] man with blond hair. He was a [[paladin]] dedicated to the service of the god [[Torm]].\n\nHaving once led a group of local heroes and [[adventurer]]s, Korox was a skilled leader of his country.\n<!--",
        "Personality": "",
        "Abilities": "-->",
        "Possessions": "King Korox ruled from the stronghold of [[Klarsamryn]] in the capital city of [[Llorbauth]] in the barony of [[Shalanar]].",
        "Crest": "The king's personal crest was an image of two interwoven red [[wyvern]]s.",
        "Activities": "Korox took a personal role in the upkeep of his nation's army, personally seeing to the training of many of its officers.\n\nThe king also controlled trade coming in and out of the port of his city and the majority of the agricultural trade as well.",
        "Relationships": "Korox Morkann was the oldest son of Duke [[Valon Morkann]], who would succeed from [[Tethyr]] to become the first king of Erlkazar. Korox' younger sister, [[Dijara Morkann|Dijara]] was married to Lord [[Purdun]], baron of [[Ahlarkhem]], and the couple were among King Korox' strongest supporters.\n\nKorox had a daughter named [[Mariko Morkann|Mariko]], whom he adored. but he was remarried by [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Before becoming king, Korox Morkann was the leader of [[Elestam's Crusaders]], a group of warriors dedicated to protecting then-duchy [[Elestam]] from evil. In this role, Morkann and his companions four separate times stopped attempted assassinations of his father, though they could never prove who had ordered the attacks.\n\nAfter the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], when the dynasty of Tethyr fell, Duke Valon made himself king and succeeded Elestam from Tethyr to become its own country. Korox and his Crusader's teamed with the [[Emerald Brotherhood]] to protect the fledgling country from both [[dragon]]s and [[vampire]]s.\n\nKorox and the Crusaders also helped defend the tiny nation against a horde of [[goblin]]s led by goblin King [[Ertyk Uhl]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. The Crusaders were at last victorious in these [[Goblin Wars (Erlkazar)|Goblin Wars]], but only after they had made an alliance with a [[Shieldbreakers|tribe]] of [[ogre]]s, which helped them defeat the smaller [[humanoid]]s.\n\nUpon the death of this father in the {{YearlinkName|1366}},<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Valon's death\">The \"Erlkazar & Folk of Intrigue\" booklet of the [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|''Lands of Intrigue'' boxed set]] claims that King Valon died in [[1366 DR]]. However, the novel [[Obsidian Ridge (novel)|''Obsidian Ridge'']] is set in that same year and states that Valon had died in the previous year, [[1365 DR|1365]]. Korox became king. Whereas his father had ruled the whole country directly, Korox appointed his friends in the Crusaders as barons over the four other baronies outside Shalanar. One of his first actions as monarch was to create the [[King's Magistrates]] to defend the kingdom.\n\nAfter the restoration of the kingdom of Tethyr by [[Zaranda Star]], King Korox had no desire to join his country back with Tethyr, but he was willing to establish trade and a military alliance and actively considered joining the [[Lords' Alliance]] as well.\n\nIn the [[1368 DR]], [[Atreus Eleint]], a citizen of Erlkazar, undertook an expedition to the [[Utter East]] to find the fabled realm of [[Langdarma]]. Atreus and his party made it to [[Edenvale]] but were then never seen again after entering the [[Yehimal Mountains]]. Queen [[Rosalind]] of Edenvale sent Atreus's personal effects to King Korox."
