Slaan was a lizardfolk barbarian of the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 century DR who encountered the Kalach-Cha near Highcliff Castle in the 1370s DR.
Slaan was built similarly to other lizardfolk in his tribe. He wore leather armor.
In the , while en route to sabotage ships in Highcliff, Slaan and his forces were attacked by undead from Highcliff Castle. After his troops fled deeper into the castle, Slaan was left fighting the undead alone. While fighting, Slaan encountered the Kalach-Cha, who helped fight off the undead. There are three possibilities when it comes to his later fate. Either the Kalach-Cha killed him and looted his body for a map to the lizardfolk cave where the attacks on ships were planned or, in exchange for helping his soldiers, Slaan led the Kalach-Cha to his chieftain for peace talks. It is also possible that Slaan was slain at the peace talks.
Slaan possessed two short swords, which he dual-wielded in combat.
Because their territory was threatened, the lizardfolk near Highcliff started attacking ships from the village to scare off the villagers. Slaan was participating in these activities.
