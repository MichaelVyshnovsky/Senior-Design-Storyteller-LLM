Prince Xeleth was the heir to the elven Xaryxian Empire that spanned numerous planets across a star system far from Realmspace.
Prince Xeleth was extremely entitled and arrogant, believing himself superior to anyone who challenged him.
He wore one of two paired rings of shooting stars, the other of which remained with his sister. 
The prince traveled the stars aboard the flagship of the Xaryxian armada, a star moth called Xaryxia.
Prince Xeleth was the one known son of Emperor Xavan, twin to his sister, Princess Xedalli. He was destined to rule the empire alongside his sister after their fathers tenure was over.

In order to honor his fathers dying wishes, Xeleth orchestrated an orbital assault on a lone planet out in Wildspace. He took command of the Xaryxian armada, and seeded the planet with energy from Xaryxis, the dying star that lay at the heart of the Xaryxian Empire. In order to prevent his sister from claiming her portion of their birthright, he stranded her on the planet in the hopes her death would help restore the light of their dying star. 
Fortunately for the princess, her ship was waylaid and she managed to join a group of adventurers and fled the doomed planet about a spelljammer. Prince Xeleth took his fleet in pursuit of his sister and her companions to Doomspace, and to the astral fortress of a mercane named Vocath. 
Prince Xeleth returned to the Temple of Light aboard the Xaryxian Imperial Citadel, in order to carry out his fathers final wishes. He began to orchestrate the funeral services for his father, and remained poised to ascend as emperor of the Xaryxian Empire. Just before his ascension, he was confronted by the same adventurers that accompanied Princess Xedalli from their doomed planet.
