'''Theamont''' was a [[satyr]] who dwelled within the [[Chondalwood]] forest during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was one among the group living in the Chondalwood referred to as the "forest children".

==Description==
He was rather tall for a satyr, with a narrow but rugged-looking face.

==History==
In [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Theamont encountered three [[human]]s traveling through his forest, one of whom was the [[chosen]] of the goddess [[Sune]]. At the behest of the Forest Queen [[Mielikki]], Theamont escorted them through the forest along the [[Forest Way]].
