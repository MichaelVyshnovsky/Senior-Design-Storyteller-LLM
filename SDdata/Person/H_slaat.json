He was the war chief and champion of Laogzed in the tribe led by Sslaar.\nCirca 1486 DR, he led a group of his warriors to defeat a drow patrol. The drow leader had a magic sword that was claimed as a trophy by chieftain Sslaar. Hslaat disagreed, saying that it was his by right of killing its owner. Soon a civil war started between Sslaars and Hslaats loyalists. Hslaat ordered the capture of Hhoort, the mate of Sslaar."
