The Queen of Thorns was a legendary entity said to sleep beneath the trees of Cormyr, where rumors claimed if she ever woke, the Obarskyrs rule of Cormyr would end.
In , Lord Erzoured Obarskyr and his vizier Krimnos devised an elaborate plan to wake the Queen of Thorns, magically bind her, use her to kill King Foril Obarskyr I, and then have Lord Erzoured publicly defeat her to become the hero and new king of Cormyr.
An old nonsense song from the area of the Kings Forest in Cormyr spoke of the sleeping Queen of Thorns, and warned that if she ever woke the kingdom might fall. Some tavern gossip in  claimed this song was actually prophecy, and the reason for Cormyrs royalty keeping the forest as a private reserve free of settlers, poachers, and the occasional orcish incursion.
Further legends, local to different regions, claimed that six different monsters called "Harbingers" would appear immediately preceding her waking to wreak havoc. Further obscure manuscripts and documents claimed the prophecy was in fact the result of a curse upon the Obarskyr line, and that a seventh and more powerful Harbinger would appear after the others. The six Harbingers named in legends were
*The Harbinger of Pestilence, a scaled monster that would assault a hamlet in the Kings Forest.
*The Harbinger of Famine, a dragon that would ravage the farms near Arabel.
*The Harbinger of Madness, a monstrous toad that would drive all within Wheloon to frenzied insanity.
*The Harbinger of Fury, a spirit that would corrupt the War Wizards in  Castle Crag.
*The Harbinger of Entropy, which would defile the cemetery of the Purple Dragon knights west of Suzail.
*The Harbinger of Destruction, which at dusk would assault the palace in Suzail itself.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, the maddened druid Halsaime knew of and believed in her legend, and proclaimed that he could wake her and wed her.
