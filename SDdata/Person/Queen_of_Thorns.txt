The '''Queen of Thorns''' was a legendary entity said to sleep beneath the trees of Cormyr, where rumors claimed if she ever woke, the Obarskyr's rule of Cormyr would end.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|1479}}, Lord [[Erzoured Obarskyr]] and his vizier [[Krimnos]] devised an elaborate plan to wake the Queen of Thorns, magically bind her, use her to kill King [[Foril Obarskyr I]], and then have Lord Erzoured publicly defeat her to become the hero and new king of Cormyr.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Curse of the Queen of Thorns|4,11-12}}

==Rumors and legends==
An old nonsense song from the area of the [[King's Forest]] in [[Cormyr]] spoke of the sleeping Queen of Thorns, and warned that if she ever woke the kingdom might fall. Some tavern gossip in {{Yearlink|1479}} claimed this song was actually prophecy, and the reason for Cormyr's royalty keeping the forest as a private reserve free of settlers, poachers, and the occasional orcish incursion.

Further legends, local to different regions, claimed that six different monsters called "Harbingers" would appear immediately preceding her waking to wreak havoc. Further obscure manuscripts and documents claimed the prophecy was in fact the result of a curse upon the Obarskyr line, and that a seventh and more powerful Harbinger would appear after the others. The six Harbingers named in legends were:
*The Harbinger of Pestilence, a scaled monster that would assault a hamlet in the King's Forest.
*The Harbinger of Famine, a dragon that would ravage the farms near [[Arabel]].
*The Harbinger of Madness, a monstrous [[toad]] that would drive all within [[Wheloon]] to frenzied insanity.
*The Harbinger of Fury, a spirit that would corrupt the [[War Wizards]] in  [[Castle Crag]].
*The Harbinger of Entropy, which would defile the cemetery of the [[Purple Dragon knight]]s west of [[Suzail]].
*The Harbinger of Destruction, which at dusk would assault the palace in Suzail itself.

During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the mid-1480s DR, the maddened druid [[Halsaime]] knew of and believed in her legend, and proclaimed that he could wake her and wed her.
