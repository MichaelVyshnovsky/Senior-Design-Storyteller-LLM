        "History": "Nentor briefly led the armies of the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in battle against brigands, [[Thentia]]n freebands, and monsters of [[Thar]]. He was later relocated to [[Zhentil Keep]] to train wizards for the Network.\n\nOn [[Flamerule 16]] of [[1358 DR]], he was in [[Ordulin]] with his apprentice [[Baedelkar]]. However, Nentor received orders from [[Manshoon]] to depart, but when he went to find Baedelkar at the [[Winking Will-o'-the-Wisp Pleasure Palace]], Baedelkar was dead. Nentor went to [[Dalelands]] and met the [[Zhentilar]] commander [[Amglar]] and the young [[Zhent]] wizard [[Myarvuk]]. They were attacked at the [[Standing Stone]] by mysterious flying arrows that killed Myarvuk and injured Amglar.\n\nLater Nentor discovered that two [[malaugrym]] were marching to [[Mistledale]] to fight [[Elminster]] and the [[Rangers Three]].\n\nThe next day Nentor together with Amglar lead the Zhent army against the defenders of Mistledale. The Zhent were winning when [[Sylune]] appeared behind Nentor and Amglar and killed the two Zhent commanders."
