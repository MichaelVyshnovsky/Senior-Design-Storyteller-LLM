Hegrad was a militia recruit of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Hegrad was young and inexperienced militiaman who was known for his honesty.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Hegrad was still a raw recruit. During that time, Liam's Hold became plagued by strange shadowy figure sightings, midnight visitors, and even poor [[Rab Bitnez]] drained of blood. [[Xanda Pennywell]], a seamstress from Liam's Hold, joined young Hegrad on several patrols as a volunteer, knowing how understaffed the militia was and wanting to defend her neighbors. During one of the patrols, Hegrad and Xanda witnessed a strange shadow sneaking around and seemingly vanish into the mist when noticed. Hegrad thought it to be just a [[thief]], but soon after, Xanda Pennywell disappeared from her home. Hegrad saw a strangely ajar door and investigated her place. He found no clothes taken, no letters left behind, nor food touched on her kitchen table. Worried, young Hegrad reported of the disappearance and the strange earlier occurrence to Mayor [[Wilsey]].
