'''''Drarra''''' was an inhabitant of the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Sweet - a magic show! It's been ages since there, was any fun in this city.''|Drarra}}

==Description==
Drarra was an [[elf|elvish]] man with blue eyes and a greenish-olive skin tone. He wore fine-quality clothes and a big floppy beret decorated with two fanciful feathers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Drarra attended a performance of showy magics by three spellslingers, on the [[Murl's Rest]] plaza in front of [[Sorcerous Sundries]]. The elf eagerly devoured the show with his eyes as the most fun he's had in the Gate, plagues by disappearings, murders, cultists, and corrupt politicians.
