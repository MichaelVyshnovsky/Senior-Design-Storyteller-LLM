Hulda was a stone giant who helped Blagothkus in managing the flying Skyreach Castle.
Hulda was very concerned about Blagothkus plan to ally with dragons and the Cult of the Dragon. As a companion of Wigluf, she supported him in all his decisions.
Hulda and her companion Wigluf were guests at Skyreach Castle. Hulda protected Wigluf when he tried to use a magic cauldron to interrogate the giant pantheon about Blagothkuss plan.
