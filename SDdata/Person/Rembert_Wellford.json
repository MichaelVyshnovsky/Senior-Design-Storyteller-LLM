        "mainbody": "embert Wellford was a young Red Wizard noble and a former apprentice to Mythrellan, the Zulkir of Illusion, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nRembert was a Red Wizard from the magical School of Illusion. He was an apprentice to Mythrellan, the Zulkir of Illusion, and a distant cousin to Dmitra Flass the tharchion of Eltabbar at the time.\nThe young Red Wizards land had the richest earth in Thay and was essential for crop production. It was situated south of Eltabbar and nearly directly east of Amruthar. It bordered lands that belonged to both Maligor and Szass Tam.\nIn 1362 DR, Rembert had recently completed his apprenticeship under Mythrellan and was in charge of his own plot of land in Thay. The young wizard was starting to build his forces and make a name for himself.\nMaligor targeted the up-and-coming Red Wizard as a ploy to distract his opponent Szass Tam from Maligors real target. The Zulkir of Alteration sent out his gnoll army to march on Remberts territory, promising half of the land to Szass Tam who very likely was going to seize the entire territory for himself before the gnoll army was to arrive."
