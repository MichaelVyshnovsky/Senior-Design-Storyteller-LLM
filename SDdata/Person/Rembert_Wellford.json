        "mainbody": "'''Rembert Wellford''' was a young [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] noble and a former apprentice to [[Mythrellan]], the Zulkir of Illusion, in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "Rembert was a Red Wizard from the magical School of [[Illusion]]. He was an apprentice to [[Mythrellan]], the Zulkir of Illusion, and a distant cousin to [[Dmitra Flass]] the tharchion of [[Eltabbar]] at the time.",
        "Possessions": "The young Red Wizard's land had the richest earth in Thay and was essential for crop production. It was situated south of Eltabbar and nearly directly east of [[Amruthar]]. It bordered lands that belonged to both [[Maligor]] and [[Szass Tam]].",
        "History": "In [[1362 DR]], Rembert had recently completed his apprenticeship under Mythrellan and was in charge of his own plot of land in Thay. The young wizard was starting to build his forces and make a name for himself.\n\nMaligor targeted the up-and-coming Red Wizard as a ploy to distract his opponent Szass Tam from Maligor's real target. The Zulkir of Alteration sent out his [[gnoll]] army to march on Rembert's territory, promising half of the land to Szass Tam who very likely was going to seize the entire territory for himself before the gnoll army was to arrive."
