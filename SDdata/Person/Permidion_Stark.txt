'''Permidion Stark''' was a [[thief]] and burglar who operated on the [[Sword Coast]] in the second half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Permidion carried a typical thief's gear: a set of [[leather armor]], a [[short sword]], a [[bow]], a couple dozen [[arrow]]s, and a singular [[gemstone]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Permidion set his sights on the [[High Hedge]] northwest of [[Beregost]]—the abode of the [[wizard]] [[Thalantyr]]. The thief salivated, thinking of all the precious magical trinkets just laying around the laboratory, but eventually decided against the heist. The big-time wizard had two powerful [[flesh golem]]s guarding the place, invulnerable to non-magical damage, and the High Hedge had no shadows to hide in. Eventually, Permidion Stark set off to find a [[halfling]] village to harass, leaving High Hedge behind.
