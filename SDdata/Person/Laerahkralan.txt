'''Laerahkralan''' was a [[greatwyrm]] [[dragon]] of [[southwest Faerûn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-28 - Velsaertirden}}

==Activities==
Laerahkralan covertly interfered in affairs of state, in everything from villages to towns to whole nations throughout the [[Shining South]] via [[human]] and [[yuan-ti]] agents. Laerahkralan was one of the many dragons that [[Velsaertirden]] investigated during his role as the Dragon Sage in the mid-to-late 1300s [[DR]].
