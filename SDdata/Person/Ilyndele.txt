Ilyndele was a powerful member of the Arcane and one of three persons responsible for creating the World Serpent Inn, according to the wizard Elminster.
Very little is known about Ilyndele except that the wildspace merchant was friends with an archmage from Toril named Alaurum. The two, together with the illithid High One Sharth, are said to have "crafted" the inter-planar inn.
Hundreds of years before the late 14 century DR, Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The demiplane within which the inn resided&mdashand the planes many portals&mdashhad already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a dreamscape resulting from a sleeping fragment of the World Serpent.
