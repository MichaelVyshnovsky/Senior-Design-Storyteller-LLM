Bhún Ludwakazar () was a dwarf gladiator of the Ludwakazar clan in Mulmaster.
Having been exiled, Bhún felt he had lost his honor and only wanted a death would win him glory in the afterlife. He regretted the conflict with his brother and secretly hoped they would reconcile before death.
Bhún was the champion gladiator of the illegal arena run by Gethmedra Darmov under the Black Blade and Bloody Boar tavern.
Bhún once lived with the rest of his clan in the Earthspur Mountains, acting as custodian of the mystical Chamber of Falling Stones. The recent mining excavations alarmed them. Bhún had a conflict with his brother, King Iorn Ludwakazar, and was subsequently exiled.
After that, he went to Mulmaster where he gained fame as the Stone Dwarf in gladiator matches.
In 1491 DR, an adventuring party approached him in order to learn about the mines and he told them his history, asking them to also send a letter of reconciliation to his brother.
