        "mainbody": "'''Tharra''' was a [[Harper]] spy.",
        "History": "Tharra hailed from [[Mistledale]] but her job with Harpers made her travel a lot.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]] Tharra met [[Magros]]; he often helped Tharra in her missions but always gained a profit from them. \n\nIn [[1486 DR]] in order to save both a village and a column of refugee from a [[Sembian]] army Tharra was forced to offer her soul to Magros.\n\nMagros, however, who had planned the entire situation, sent her as his spy to the secret [[shadovar]] village for captured [[Chosen]], where she posed as a maid in the service of [[Adolican Rhand]]. She made everyone talk to each other, and kept all the people safe. She was ordered to dress [[Farideh]] with appropriate clothes.\n\nLater, in the streets of the village, she approached to the disguised [[Dahl Peredur]]. Together they started plotting how to escape. \n\nAt last, however, after Tharra tried to kill [[Oota]] Dahl and [[Farideh]] discovered her bargain with Magros, she told them her story, but was enchained, though Farideh later asked for her assistance recovering  a [[scroll]] from the Rhands' study. \n\nShe was eventually taken into custody by her Harper brethren so she might explain her actions to a jury of her peers."
