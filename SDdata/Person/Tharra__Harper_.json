She made everyone talk to each other, and kept all the people safe. She was ordered to dress Farideh with appropriate clothes.\nLater, in the streets of the village, she approached to the disguised Dahl Peredur. Together they started plotting how to escape. \nAt last, however, after Tharra tried to kill Oota Dahl and Farideh discovered her bargain with Magros, she told them her story, but was enchained, though Farideh later asked for her assistance recovering  a scroll from the Rhands study. \nShe was eventually taken into custody by her Harper brethren so she might explain her actions to a jury of her peers."
