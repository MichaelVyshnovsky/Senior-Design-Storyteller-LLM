        "mainbody": "'''Vejoni H. Wyzz''' was a planar-traveling [[wizard]] and merchant of wondrous things who visited the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in [[1372 DR]].\n{{quote|This, my confused friend, is a fully fledged plane of existence controlled by yours truly, pinched off, if you will, from the Prime, and free to travel and intersect with other planes as I will it.|Vejoni H. Wyzz}}",
        "Description": "Vejoni was a charismatic older bespectacled gentleman adorned in luxurious black-and-gold [[robe]]s.",
        "History": "Vejoni H. Wyzz's history was shrouded in mystery. He was a planeswalker, a merchant of curious and powerful magics, and operated out of a tent that opened into his personal pocket plane. The wizard's visitors were exposed to a single circular room in Vejoni's plane. The room was a dark and sinister circular stone-covered hall. Chains descended from the room's ceiling and the walls were decorated with floating orbs and stretched skins of unknown origin. There was a table with goods as well as four [[gargoyle]]s. Vejoni could direct the pocket plane to travel between worlds as he felt fit.\n\nVejoni claimed to have found the pocket plane already formed, and he claimed it for himself. The wizard used ''[[divination]]'' magics to gain knowledge of the strange place and discover its controls.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Vejoni H. Wyzz placed his tent on the [[Trade Way]], not far from [[Liam's Hold]]. He spent several days on [[Toril]], waiting on a business appointment. During his stay, he gladly traded with visitors of his strange magical tent. During that time, the tent was visited by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who stepped through the pulsing yellow portal in the tent's entrance and entered the wizard's pocket plane."
