        "mainbody": "'''Lashyrr Maerdrymm''', more commonly known simply as '''the White Lady''', was an [[aquatic elf]] [[baelnorn]] and the leader of the [[Dukar]] [[Order of Numos]] in [[Myth Nantar]] in [[Serôs]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was titled the Grand Savant of the First Order and Paragon of the Numosi Order.",
        "Activities": "Of all the Dukar paragons, Lashyrr was most public and well known around [[1370 DR]]. Following hundreds of years of isolation in Myth Nantar and [[Qatoris]], she looked forward to rebuilding links with other [[elves]].\n\nHigh Mage [[Pharom Ildacer]] of the Nantarn Council was in secret discussions with Lashyrr to exchange magical knowledge: she would learn a little of [[elven High Magic]] and he would learn of Dukar magic and their [[Coral]] Hand power.",
        "Relationships": "Lashyrr believed herself to be the last of her family, and so had not used her clan name in more than two centuries. In truth, she was a cousin of [[Khelben Arunsun]], the Blackstaff of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "On becoming a baelnorn, Lashyrr transformed her body into living [[pearl]], rather than an [[undead]] state. She resembled a statue of pale blue and ivory hue, and looked as beautiful as she did in her younger days, despite being some 975 years of age as of [[1370 DR]]."
