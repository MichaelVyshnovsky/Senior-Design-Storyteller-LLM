        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved [[teleport]]ing goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from [[Luskan]] to follow two of his scouts, [[Ennelia]] and [[Braston]], southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.\n\nIn the cavers underneath the Legion's fortress, Ilquog stood guard of the barghest camp. The creature allowed anyone who knew the simple password \"Xvim\" through the barghest territory."
