        "Description": "Drauz had patchy whiskers.",
        "Possessions": "Drauz had a ship that could be described as having a worn appearance.",
        "History": "According to dockworkers, Captain Drauz the Dreg used deceit and managed to assume the role of [[harbormaster]] of the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake district]]'s docks in Neverwinter. He was spotted flogging the dockworkers on multiple occasions, and there was a troubling incident where he took candy from a small child.\n\nCirca {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Drauz was \"put in his place\" by a [[Fighter (Before the Storm)|carpenter]] who was since called a \"hero\" among local dockworkers. Drauz then left the town.\n\nNevertheless, in {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} his ship was docked at Pier 9 of the docks of the Blacklake district. By chance, he unexpectedly received several pleas from adventurers, among whom was the carpenter who had thrown a wrench in the captain's lfve, to be ferried to [[Stormwreck Isle]] aboard his ship on the same day. It's unknown how exactly the carpenter ultimately got to the isle; he may have saved Drauz's ship from a pirate, or he had simply stowed aboard the ship."
