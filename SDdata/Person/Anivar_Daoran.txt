Lord Protector '''Anivar Daoran''' was a royal member of [[House Daoran]] and the monarch of [[Phlan]] for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|52}} He ruled the city from the Cinnabar Throne of [[Valjevo Castle]].

{{Quote|The heathen barbarians dare attack our holdings in the north, and for that I would see them driven completely from [[the Ride]]. Return to Phlan triumphant and present to me the heads of their chieftains. This I demand!|Lord Protector Anivar.}}

==Personality==
Lord Anivar was a self-centered and paranoid man who cared more about holding onto his power than the lives and well-being of his subjects. He exhibited the overwhelming sense of of entitlement that came with years of over-indulgence and no development of personal virtues such as wit or bravery in the face of danger.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|65}} 

He was considered to be wholly ineffectual as a ruler, deferring responsibilities of governance to the heads of Phlan's noble families.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}} 

==Activities==
During his reign, Anivar Daoran had embarked upon various reconstruction projects throughout the cities with little foresight for their cost or time of completion.

==Relationships==
In contrast to Anivar's abhorrent personality, the dynasty of House Daoran was formed by daring conquest. His grandfather [[Cvaal Daoran]] stood defiant against the [[Shadovar]] of [[Netheril]] in the 1380s [[DR]] and claimed Phlan in his family's name.

He was served dutifully by the Lord's Seneschal [[Rolf]], the [[Sage]] of [[Mantor's Library]] [[Opanrael]], and Knight Commander [[Ector Brahms]] of the [[Knights of the Black Fist]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, barbarians from [[the Ride]] sacked the vassal settlements of [[Whitehorn]], [[Verdigris]], and [[Ilinvur]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|49}} creating refugees of the towns' residents and forcing them to retreat to Phlan for shelter. The Lord Protector spurned his subjects and ordered the [[Phlan/Old City|Old City]] to be locked down.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|50}} 

He later met with a band of [[adventurer]]s and tasked them with killing the chieftains of each of the barbarian tribes but cared little for their success. In truth the Lord Protector sought to force the refugees from the northern settlements to become soldiers, and march them off to fight the tribes of the Ride, solving both the issues he saw as troubles that plagued and interfered with his rulership.

Some time over the next few years,{{ToD-time}} Lord Anivar was unexpectedly killed in a construction mishap while touring Valjevo Castle during a period of renovation. He had no heir apparent and rule of the city passed down to Knight Commander Ector Brahms.{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|6}}
