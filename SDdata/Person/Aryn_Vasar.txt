Aryn was a member of the [[Hunters' Guild of Chult]], and could often be found at [[Hunter's Square]] in Port Nyanzaru.

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]]{{ToA-time}} Aryn perceived an increase in the number of undead haunting the jungles outside Port Nyanzaru. She became interested in hunting a evil spirit known as [[Maita]] as well as an undead abomination known as [[Split-ti]], a [[lich]] known as [[Thazar-De]], and a [[beholder]] called [[Erjellel]].
