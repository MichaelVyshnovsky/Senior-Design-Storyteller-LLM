'''Ahja the Azure''' was a male [[human]] magician of [[Luskan]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Ahja was a mage of [[Luskan]], who was trained by the [[Host Tower]] wizards. [[Black Garius]] employed him to send the Luskan agents to [[Neverwinter]].

==Gameplay==
When the [[Kalach-Cha]] and companions encountered the Luskan spies, they needed to defeat them and Ahja. When Ahja is severely wounded, he would told them that his employer was Garius, the Master of the Fifth Tower. Once done, he would become hostile once more and needed to be killed.
