Ahja the Azure was a male human magician of Luskan on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Ahja was a mage of Luskan, who was trained by the Host Tower wizards. Black Garius employed him to send the Luskan agents to Neverwinter.
When the Kalach-Cha and companions encountered the Luskan spies, they needed to defeat them and Ahja. When Ahja is severely wounded, he would told them that his employer was Garius, the Master of the Fifth Tower. Once done, he would become hostile once more and needed to be killed.
