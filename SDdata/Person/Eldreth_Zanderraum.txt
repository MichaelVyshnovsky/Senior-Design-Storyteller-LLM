'''Eldreth Zanderraum''' was a [[flameskull]] mercenary in [[Skullport]] in [[1379 DR]].

==Activities==
Eldreth managed the [[Unyielding Sword]] mercenary company in Skullport.

==History==
Once Eldreth was a wizard who became a free-willed flameskull.

In 1379 DR, the slaver [[Lanador]] hired Eldreth and his men to kidnap ten [[elves]] from [[Waterdeep]]'s streets. Unfortunately, unknown to them, one of them was a member of the [[Agents of the Eye]]. So the [[Xanathar]] supported an adventuring party to enter Lanador's lair. In the central room of the lair were Eldreth and Lanador and in the fighting both were defeated.[[Derek Myers]]. "Eyes on The Ball." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206.
