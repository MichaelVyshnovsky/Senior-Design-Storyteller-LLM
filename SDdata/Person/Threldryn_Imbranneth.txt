'''Threldryn Imbranneth''' was a knight and a noble of [[Cormyr]] who rode with Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]].

==History==
In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Alusair and her knights were operating in the [[Stonelands]], pursuing a bold [[orc]] band that had raided a caravan east of [[Eveningstar]]; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a [[hydra]], a "[[fire lizard]]", and three [[chimera]]s. [[Beldred Truesilver]] sent Threldryn and [[Brace Skatterhawk]] to watch Alusair when she stepped aside to receive a private message. They returned to find Beldred and the knights had impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs, before deducing they served a [[dark naga]] and the [[Zhentarim]], who had been charming and transporting monsters into the area; Threldryn struggled to catch up to her reasoning. He was one of those who volunteered to aid Alusair, and had a hand in slaying the naga.
