'''Nizella''' was the mate of the [[kobold]] scribe [[Azetlin]] of a tribe from [[Undermountain]] that raided streets of [[Waterdeep]] midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Nizella's tribe was forced to relocate to the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]]. There the kobolds settled in the area that later got flooded, making some of them sick. Nizella got "sneeze-sick" and, to her mate's annoyance, full of snot.
