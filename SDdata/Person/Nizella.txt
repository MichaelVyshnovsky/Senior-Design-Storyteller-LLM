Nizella was the mate of the kobold scribe Azetlin of a tribe from Undermountain that raided streets of Waterdeep midâ€“14 century DR.
In 1370 DR, Nizellas tribe was forced to relocate to the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. There the kobolds settled in the area that later got flooded, making some of them sick. Nizella got "sneeze-sick" and, to her mates annoyance, full of snot.
