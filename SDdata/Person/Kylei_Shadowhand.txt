Kylei Shadowhand, and her sister Hylei, were members of the Sisters of the Blood Moon in the early 14 century DR.
Kylei was a nimble and capable thief who could bluff her way out of an ogres cooking cauldron.
The gnome was armed with a light crossbow.
Circa the , the rock gnome twin sisters Hylei and Kylei befriended a half-elven ranger, Nevae Quar. Together, the women adventured and and tried to stay out of trouble despite Kyleis love of pickpocketing. One fateful night, they came across a site of a goblin ambush in a forest outside Silverymoon. Three fellow adventurers—Sferia Ranul, Oaglata, and Nyzeil Nighthammer—were fighting for their lives, and the trio of women rushed to help. The group dispatched the bandits with natural ease, battling in synch. Sferia became enamored with the new allies battle prowess and convinced them to join her adventuring band, the Sisters of the Blood Moon.
In 1310 DR, Sferia Ranul received a letter a plea for help from the town of Targos in Icewind Dale. Despite the promise of gold and fame, Sferia led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help.
