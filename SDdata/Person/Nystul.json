Dwarf fighter from the Duchy of Tenh named Yars Blud-Sigul was Nystuls acquaintance and aided him against lich Vecna.\nNystul often carried such defensive magic items as bracers of defense, a ring of protection, and a cloak of displacement. However, he was armed only with a simple dagger, which he seldomly used for anything but peeling an apple. Other wondrous items in Nystuls possession were boots of levitation, dust of disappearance, a hat of disguise, a helm of telepathy, a wand of enemy detection, a wand of illusion, and a wand of illumination.
