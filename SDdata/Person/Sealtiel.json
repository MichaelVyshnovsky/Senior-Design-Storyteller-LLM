        "mainbody": "'''Sealtiel''' ({{Pronounce|see|AHL|teel|refs= in the [[House of the Triad]]. His symbol was the [[dog]], and he was a patron of [[warden archon]]s.",
        "Description": "Sealtiel was a beautiful [[tome archon]] standing nine feet (three meters) tall. Sexless, but with masculine features, he had large wings with metallic white feathers. His skin was ebony, and his eyes were silver and shone like stars. He had no hair and wore no armor or clothing but was surrounded by a glittering aura.",
        "Abilities": "Sealtiel had all of the powers common to tome archons. In addition to these, unique magical abilities were available to him. He could [[detect chaos]] and [[Detect evil|evil]] and [[True seeing|see any creature as they truly were]].\n\nBy thought alone, he could [[consecrate]] an area with [[positive energy]], create a [[Continual flame|ceaseless fire]], [[Daylight|illuminate an area with a light as bright as day]], surround his head with a flaming [[crown of brilliance]] so bright to blind foes, [[Greater dispelling|dispel all but the most powerful magical effects]], [[hallow|make a site holy]], protect his allies with a [[holy aura]], [[Ray of hope|instill hope in subjects within range]], [[Sending|send a short message to an individual anywhere in the multiverse]], [[Shield of the archons|defend himself with a mystical shield]], [[Sword of conscience|fill an evil creature with intense feelings of remorse]], and grant a subject a [[Vision of heaven|vision of the Seven Heavens]]. He could also [[Message|whisper messages]] to recipients at a distance.\n\nFor his allies, he could [[Imbue with spell ability|imbue them with the ability to cast certain spells]]. He could blind his enemies by [[holy smite|smiting them with holy power]]. With a single, spoken [[holy word]], he could slay or banish wicked beings, and he could harm and daze creatures of chaos with the [[order's wrath|power of order]].\n\nOnce a day, Sealtiel could perform a [[miracle]] or cause a great [[earthquake]].\n\nSealtiel was extraordinarily skilled at defensive tactics. If he took a defensive stance in combat and remained in one location, his personal defense became even more phenomenal.\n\nSealtiel could also grant a supernatural power of defense to others. No matter the size, any building or structure occupied by Sealtiel was substantially harder to damage, including all of its doors, walls, and other objects. Inhabitants of the structure also received magical defensive protection from his very presence.",
        "Possessions": "Sealtiel's favored weapon was a large [[greatclub]], wreathed in white flames of holy fire.\n\nHe ruled from the fortress of [[Pax Exaltea]], also known as Vanguard, on the sixth level of the city of [[Yetsira]] in Jovar.",
        "Activities": "As Defender of the Seven Heavens, Sealtiel led a huge standing army of [[Celestial archon|archons]] and other [[celestial]]s in defense of the plane and especially [[Chronias]], the Seventh Heaven, which was forbidden to all but the most pure.\n\nAs patron of the warden archons, Sealtiel provided the watchers with new orders. They also often came to him for enlightenment, hoping to gain advice on how to live in such a way as to eventually enter the Seventh Heaven.",
        "Relationships": "One of Sealtiel's favored champions was Arkareon, a nature-loving [[movanic deva]] whom Sealtiel had [[True resurrection|raised from the dead]] at least seventeen times to continue in his service."
