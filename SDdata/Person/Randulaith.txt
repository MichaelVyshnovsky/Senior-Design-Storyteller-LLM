'''Randulaith''' was an [[Illuskan]] [[human]] male [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] of [[Skullport]].

==Description==
Randulaith favored plain clothes of tunic and [[breeches]], but was elegant in dress.

==Personality==
Randulaith was quiet and not a cruel man. He easily made friends among all races and beliefs. He enjoyed fine [[wine]], witty jokes, and desired [[mermaid]]s.

==Activities==
Thanks to his amiable nature, Randulaith was a valuable spy for the [[Xanathar]]. He frequented Skullport and the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]].

==History==
Randulaith was originally from [[Mirabar]], but eventually left the city and came to Skullport. There, he became one of the lieutenants of the Xanathar. He was even tasked with guarding the Eye's lair in [[Undermountain]].

His long-held plan was to join the ranks of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. He learned from his fellow Xanathar agent [[Colstan Rhuul]] that [[Brianne Byndraeth]] was one of the Lords and decided to court her in order to achieve his objective. He successfully got engaged with her. Unknown to Randulaith, he was also under scrutiny for membership in the Lords by [[Caladorn Cassalanter]] and [[Sammereza Sulphontis]].
