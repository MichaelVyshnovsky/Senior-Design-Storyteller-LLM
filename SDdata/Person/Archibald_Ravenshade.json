        "Description": "Archibald was a haughty-looking [[half-elven]] man with greenish-tinted skin, long wavy brown hair, and well-groomed facial hair.",
        "Activities": "Lord Ravenshade was known as a master author and playwright who penned sonnets and plays about \"ambition, supernatural tensions with the natural world, avarice, love, and moving bushes.\" One of his plays was called ''[[Porklet]].''",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a portrait of Archibald Ravenshade painted by [[Oskar Fevras]] was kept in the attic of the [[Jannath estate]] of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing [[poltergeist]] unwittingly summoned by the painter. The picture whispered alluringly, only to shriek later, startling observers. Other copies of the same painting were seen across the city of Baldur's Gate."
