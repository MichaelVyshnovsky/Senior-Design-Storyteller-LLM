'''Ilimitar''' was an [[elf|elven]] Royal [[Archmage]] in [[Cormanthyr]] at the time that [[Elminster Aumar]] was nominated [[Armathor]].

==History==
When he was young, Ilimitar was an apprentice of the [[Srinshee]]. Later, he became one of the two Supreme Court Wizards in the service of [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]].

However, when Elminster was nominated armathor by the coronal, an insult in his eyes, Ilimitar considered his old master a traitor and tried to kill the Srinshee but after a fierce battle she defeated him.
