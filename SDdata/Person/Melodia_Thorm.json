        "mainbody": "elodia Thorm was a half-elf of House Thorm, a follower of Sel没ne, and the wife of General Ketheric Thorm, as well as the mother of Isobel Thorm.\nthumb|240px|Ketheric Thorm mourning Melodia.\nPrior to 986 DR, Melodia married Ketheric Thorm, and the marriage was a genuine love match. The union bore a daughter, named Isobel Thorm. Morfred, the individual whom Ketheric commissioned to build Moonrise Towers, believed that it was through Melodias influence that Ketheric converted from his previous deity to Sel没ne, Melodias patron. At some point, Melodia died of an illness, leaving a grief-stricken Ketheric to raise Isobel alone, though Isobel would soon die after her mother. In his grief, Ketheric abandoned Sel没ne and turned to Shar, beginning a plan to eliminate all Sel没nite presence within Reithwin, with this eventually concluding by 1373 DR.\nDespite this, however, Ketheric still thought highly of his late wife, and believed she would not recognize the man she loved if she were still alive. Isobel likewise shared his sentiment, and reflected she missed her greatly. Several busts, whether contemporary or not, with Melodias likeness were found within Moonrise Towers as of 1492 DR, and one existed in Isobels former room. Isobel also had a painting of her parents in her possession."
