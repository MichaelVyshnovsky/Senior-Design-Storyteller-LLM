'''Bene''' was a commoner [[human]] from [[Athkatla]], the City of Coin, in [[Amn]] who lived in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bene met his demise in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He, along with several other men, was captured by a [[drow]] [[druid]] named [[Pai'Na]] who built a massive spider nest in ancient tombs underneath Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]]. Bene and other peasants were consumed from the inside by Pai'Na's spiders.
