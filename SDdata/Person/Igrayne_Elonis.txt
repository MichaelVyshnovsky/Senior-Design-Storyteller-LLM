==History==
{{Quote
|Once, long ago, I was a Priestess of Mystra. How can I continue now that my goddess is gone?
|Igrayne
}}
Igrayne was once a priestess of Mystra, but after her goddess's death in [[1385 DR]] she was left aimless. Around the time of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] during the [[Darkening]] of [[1484 DR|1484]]â€“[[1485 DR]], Igrayne lived in [[Eveningstar]], though still despondent. She could be seen standing on a small cliff near the village, pondering her existence.
