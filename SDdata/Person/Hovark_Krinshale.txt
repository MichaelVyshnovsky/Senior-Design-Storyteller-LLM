Hovark Krinshale was a half-orc monk member of the Shadow Thieves in Skullport in 1379 DR.
In 1379 DR, Hovark was tasked with the mission to find and kill the slaver Lanador, a rival of the Xanathar, who had also betrayed the Shadow Thieves in 1369 DR. Posing as a Skullport fisherman, Hovark tried to infiltrate the Unyielding Sword mercenaries working for Lanador but was captured.  
Hovark would do anything for success in his mission, even working momentarily for his target.
