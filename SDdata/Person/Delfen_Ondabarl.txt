'''Delfen Ondabarl''' was the greatest [[wizard]] of [[Daggerford]] and a teacher at the [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Delfen Yellowknife was a human male with well-groomed and fashionably styled facial hair. His rich-looking robes betrayed his vocation of a wizard.

==Personality==
Delfen Yellowknife could be deemed a happy-go-lucky individual. He was friendly and gladly showed visitors around his beloved guild.

==Relationship==
[[Sujit]] the [[imp]] was Delfen's close friend and familiar ever since he rescued the little creature from its cruel master, [[Mogdor]] - Delfen's bitter nemesis.

Delfen Ondabarl's one time apprentice was [[Vexter]] the Master of Illusion. By the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Vexter finished his apprenticeship and adventured across the Planes.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|421|Vexter, Master of lllusionn}}

==History==
Delfen was an adventuring wizard from [[Iriaebor]] who retired to Daggerford around [[1355 DR]].

After retirement, he spent his time tutoring the next generation of mages. He lived in an abandoned tower in exchange for a donation to the duchy's treasure. He became famous from [[Icewind Dale]] to [[Calimshan]] as a very patient teacher of the arcane arts. Delfen also helped the local militia in all magical matters.

''Circa'' [[1372 DR]] Delfen was a member of the [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]] mages guild. During that time, he was distracted due to the recent disappearance of one of his dearest friends and often teared up thinking about the dire situation. The [[Hero of Daggerford]] came across him during their visit to the Encapsulate's library and offered their aid, but Delfen did not have the slightest idea where even to start the search. The missing person was Sujit the imp, Delfen's friend and [[familiar]]. The creature was captured by a bounty hunter, and criminal from Daggerford named [[Erik the Fin]] who was promised one thousand [[gold]] [[coin]]s for the task. Mogdor, Sujit's previous master wanted the creature back and punished for a betrayal. Erik successfully captured the imp but lost the chest that served as Sujit's prison. The chest disappeared into [[Delimbiyr River]] and washed ashore hours away from the city, in a water cave in the [[Western Farmlands]]. The Hero of Daggerford agreed to help Erik the Fin recover his missing chest without realizing who or what was inside.

When the Hero found the mysterious talking chest, it asked to be returned to its master in the Sorceller's Encapsulate. The imp was reunited with his friend in exchange for a reward of coin, ''[[potions of healing]]'', and a ''[[wand]]''. Seeing this as an opportunity, Delfen Ondabarl instructed the adventurer to return a different chest to the kidnapper with a deadly surprise inside for Mogdor, his arch-nemesis.

Delfen was presumed dead around [[1385 DR]]. However, in [[1485 DR]], he returned to the town, not a day older, and reclaimed possession of his tower. He was Delfen for certain, but never spoke about what had happened to him in his century's absence.
