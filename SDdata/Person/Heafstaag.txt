'''Heafstaag''' was the hereditary king of the [[Tribe of the Elk]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Description==
Heafstaag bore many wounds from his time on the harsh tundra. He had only one eye, with the other lost to a [[reindeer]]'s antler, and his left hand was rendered useless after an attack by a [[polar bear]].

He hated wizards, but nonetheless allied with [[Akar Kessel]].

==History==
Heafstaag was the son of [[Hrothulf|Hrothulf the Strong]] and grandson of [[Angaar (Tribe of the Elf)|Angaar the Brave]].<ref>{{Cite book/The Crystal Shard/Paperback (1988)}||3} His mother was a woman from [[Luskan]] who had been captured as a child during a caravan raid and who had been raised by the Tribe of the Elk.

In the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, Heafstaag, his tribe of [[barbarian]]s, and his allies tried but failed to conquer the settlement of [[Termalaine]] in their massive sweep of the [[Ten-Towns]]. Heafstaag was seriously wounded by Drizzt in the battle. His standard bearer at the time was [[Wulfgar]].

When Akar Kessel fought against the Ten Towns in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Heafstaag's tribe would have followed Kessel to battle but Wulfgar claimed the throne using the [[Right of Challenge]] and killed Heafstaag beforehand.
