'''Tracea Carol''' was a [[conjurer]] who led a [[demon]]ic cult in [[Ulgoth's Beard]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Tracea and her fellow cultists worshiped a [[nabassu]] known as [[Aec'Letec]]. They believed the fiend to be their god and revered it as such.

She was prone to "fever-dreams" during which she believed Aec-Letec spoke to her directly.

==History==
For many years Tracea and her followers prepared for the day they could release Aec'Letec onto [[Faerûn]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, they actively sought out the ''[[Soultaker dagger]]'' in order to destroy it and release the demon. While they were not strong enough delve into [[Durlag's Tower]] to retrieve the artifact, they waited until the adventurer [[Abdel Adrian]] did so at the behest of [[Hurgan Stoneblade]].

When Abdel returned to meet Hurgan at Ulgoth's Beard, Tracea's devotees stole the dagger in order to perform the ritual to [[conjuration|conjure]] forth Aec'Letec. While they were successful in this endeavor, both the demon and its cultists were defeated by Abdel and his companions.
