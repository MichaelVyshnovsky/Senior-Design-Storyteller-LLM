Tracea Carol was a conjurer who led a demonic cult in Ulgoths Beard during the mid–14 century DR.
Tracea and her fellow cultists worshiped a nabassu known as AecLetec. They believed the fiend to be their god and revered it as such.
She was prone to "fever-dreams" during which she believed Aec-Letec spoke to her directly.
For many years Tracea and her followers prepared for the day they could release AecLetec onto Faerûn. In the , they actively sought out the Soultaker dagger in order to destroy it and release the demon. While they were not strong enough delve into Durlags Tower to retrieve the artifact, they waited until the adventurer Abdel Adrian did so at the behest of Hurgan Stoneblade.
When Abdel returned to meet Hurgan at Ulgoths Beard, Traceas devotees stole the dagger in order to perform the ritual to conjure forth AecLetec. While they were successful in this endeavor, both the demon and its cultists were defeated by Abdel and his companions.
