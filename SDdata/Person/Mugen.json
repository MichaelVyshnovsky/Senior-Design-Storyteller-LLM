        "History": "Following the Shadow War of the {{YearlinkName|1374}} and with the war with [[Luskan]] just two years prior, the economy and trade on the [[Sword Coast North]] were in shambled. Desperate to boost the commerce in the Jewel of the North, [[Nasher Alagondar]] opened the gates, conditionally, to a Thayan enclave. It was built on the [[Tyr's Eye]] plaza in Neverwinter, and aged Red Wizard Akila was appointed as its ''khazark.'' The offered Thayvian goods for trade, and Akila's enclave was staffed and guarded by gnolls. To no surprise, locals mistrusted the Red Wizard trade outpost. One individual from Neverwinter attempted to break in for some nefarious reason, but ended up trapped in the enclave's defensive contraptions. Even though the invader was freed by Mugen, the man fled from the Tyr's Eye in utter terror."
