'''Amphail Caradoon''', known as '''Amphail the Just''', was a paladin in the service of [[Tyr]]. War Lord of [[Waterdeep]] during the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Amphail was the middle of three Caradoon brothers. The oldest brother was [[Renwick Caradoon]], a noted [[wizard]], and the youngest brother was [[Samular Caradoon]]. Amphail and Samular were both paladins in the service of Tyr. The three possessed three magical [[ring]]s later known as ''[[rings of Samular]]''.

==History==
At the onset of the [[Trollwars|Second Trollwar]] in the {{yearlinkName|940}}, the three brothers were able to use the ''rings of Samular'' to operate a magical [[siege engine]] called ''[[Kezefbane]]''. They used it most effectively against the [[troll]]s and ended their siege of Waterdeep. Having displayed leadership and valor, Amphail was afterward named War Lord of the city. He succeeded [[Gharl]], successor to [[Nimoar]].

At one point, he retrieved ''[[Gurt's greataxe]]'' from its burial in [[Morgur's Mound]], and took it back to Waterdeep.

But his reign lasted only one year as he was killed in a raid by the trolls. He was succeeded by another five War Lords before the end of that twelve-year-long conflict. Without Amphail, ''Kezefbane'' was not nearly as effective.

===Legacy===
The village of [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]] was named after him, as he'd owned estates there, though his keep was since lost without a trace. His ghost was still said to to ride the land here and to scare away trolls and barbarians.{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}}{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|7}} Also known as the "Ghost of Amphail", most visitors heard the tale and most residents dismissed it as an attempt to add some attraction, veteran guards swore to having seen him patrolling the streets. Local baker [[Halana Shauluth]] declared Amphail's ghost had frightened off thieves who'd tried to rob her early on morning and rode after them, even tilting a wide-brimmed in greeting to her as he went by.
