{{quote|''I see little has changed yer candor, Shagbag. Still a lant-gulpin' dirt chute.''|Korgan Bloodaxe}}

==Description==
Shagbag was a pale-skinned [[human]] male [[fighter]], adorned with a set of simple [[chainmail]] [[armor]] and a horned [[helmet]].

==Abilities==
As a warrior, Shagbag used a [[short sword]] and defended himself with a medium-sized [[shield]].

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Shagbag led an adventuring band of low morals that consisted of [[Crazyface]], Korgan Bloodaxe, [[Scrooloose]], [[Stitch (adventurer)|Stitch]], [[Hogbelly]], and [[Cutter (adventurer)|Cutter]]. The band collected valuable tomes for [[Pimlico]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. One day, the group erupted into violence over an especially prized bounty, ending the lives of Hogbelly, Stitch, and Cutter and leading to Korgan parting ways with the group. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Shagbag led a group of two unnamed thugs, Crazyface, and Shagbag in confronting the old ally over the ''[[Book of Kaza]]'' the dwarf was searching. The outcome of the confrontation was unknown; however, all three lives were said to had been cut down by the dwarven berserker and his allies atop the [[Copper Coronet]] in Athkatla.
