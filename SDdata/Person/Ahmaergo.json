        "mainbody": "Ahmaergo () was a member of the Iron Ring and the most competent slaver of the Xanathar Thieves Guild of Skullport since 1370 DR.\nAhmaergo had a fascination with minotaurs. He was devious and corrupt like a devil but totally loyal to his master.\nHe usually had many magical objects on his person for self-defense.\nAhmaergo was in charge of buying and selling the slaves acquired by the Guild. He also was in charge of the logistic aspects of the slave market, moving them to and from those involved. \nCirca 1370 DR, he was linked to the Black Tankard, a tavern in the Lower Port.\nAhmaergo worked many for years in the Guild as a slaver but the Xanathar did not fully trust him and kept a close watch on him, usually via Avaereene, the Guilds slave-taker. The dwarf hated this intrusion in his business. He was starting to get ambitious, wanting to leave the Xanathar and work as an independent slaver.\nTo add more temptation, Ahmaergo was also secretly one of the leaders of the Iron Ring. To others, he posed as a liaison with the Iron Ring.\nAround 1492 DR, Ahmaergo was the Xanathars majordomo and the most influential member of the guild after his master."
