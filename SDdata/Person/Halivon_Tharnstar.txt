'''Halivon Tharnstar''', also known as '''Avowed of Mystra''', was the author of the ''[[Tales Told to a Blind Wizard]]'', penned in [[1363 DR]].

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, Halivon met a "crazed" man who claimed to have found the fabled ''[[One True Spell]]''. The Avowed of [[Mystra]] noted that the man was not "crazed" at all; instead, the stranger appeared content, freed from urges and vices. Spells did not affect the man, and he could weave enchantments with a mere thought. When asked about the ''One True Spell'', the "crazed" man informed Halivon that it was a woman named Mystra.

This enchanted was detailed in Halivon Tharnstar's book â€“ the ''Tales Told to a Blind Wizard'', published sometime before 1363 DR.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}
