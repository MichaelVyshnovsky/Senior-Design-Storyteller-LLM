'''Quelamia''' was an [[eladrin]] [[mage]] and the most powerful wizard in the employ of [[House Serrat]] of [[Delzimmer]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was so important to the family's business that she was given a percentage of profits, something no other employee received.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|459}}

==Description==
Quelamia had blond hair and blue pupil-less eyes.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|439}}

==History==
Quelamia was originally from the [[Feywild]] although it is unknown when she first came to [[Toril]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|443}} At some point in her life, she was a war wizard but gave up the profession for more peaceful pursuits decades before [[1479 DR]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|365}}

In [[1364 DR]], the [[evil]] [[yuan-ti]] [[god]] [[Zehir]] appeared to Quelamia and enlisted her aid. In exchange for aiding [[Zaltys Serrat]] in her quest to free her birth clan from [[slavery|enslavement]] by [[derro]], Zehir agreed to help destroy the derro's ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Far Realm]]. Because Quelamia, as an eladrin, was part of the natural world, she considered the Far Realm to be the antithesis of everything she believed in and thought temporarily allying with an evil god was the lesser evil.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3681}}

In [[1479 DR]], Zaltys learned that her original clan had been abducted rather than killed by derro and she adventured into the [[Underdark]] to free them. Quelamia refused to join the rescue party organized by [[Alaia Serrat]] because she had many enemies in the [[Feydark]] who would sense her presence in Toril's Underdark and would attack the group.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1610}} She did, however, provide Zaltys and her cousin [[Julen Serrat|Julen]] a number of magic items, including [[leather armor]] made from a [[shadow snake]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|?}}
