He thought very little of Arkion and Nemphre, two feuding necromancers that lived in the city. 
In the , Ordulinian sought to stop Arkion and Nemphre in their petty contests that involved stealing trinkets from one another and bodies from the sewers that ran beneath the city. He hoped to do so without the use of violence if possible.
