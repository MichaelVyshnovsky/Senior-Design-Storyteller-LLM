Mangobarl Lorren was the baker of Red Larch during the Elemental Evil crisis. He ran his shop in that village.
He was a staunch and discreet ally of the Zhentarim, thanks to some of his distant relatives who were in that organization. He told them all about what he heard in the village.
He loved to gossip and knew all kinds of wild tales, few of them true.
In 1491 DR, he heard about Pell Mhandyvvers scare at the Haunted Tomb and went to look for himself, discovering a goblin.
