        "Relationships": "Maggie was a child of Oliver and [[Kroyce Tefoco]], and had a number of siblings. The oldest of them was [[Bubbles Tefoco]], who lived in the [[Stonyeyes]] district of the Gate with her family and the newborn [[Dorimara]]. Another older sibling was [[Dariel Tefoco]] who served the [[Flaming Fist]]. [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]] and [[Crowell Tefoco|Crowell]] were traveling caravan guards, while the youngest of the bunch, [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]], Maggie, and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Possessions": "Maggie kept a piece of paper that recorded her favorite \"[[Cookie|cukies]]\" recipe. It called for [[butter]], \"[[sugar|shugar]],\" [[egg]], \"[[flour|flower]],\" and \"[[Chocolate|chokluts]].\" The instructions read as follows: \"mix ingerdians, make cukie shapes, put cukies in stowve, yum yum yum!\"",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened Baldur's Gate's safety, Kroyce Tefoco took Hemjax, Maggie, and the other youngest kids to the town of [[Beregost]] to live with Uncle [[Sternwell]], away from the threat of war. Oliver stayed behind to run the shop, to Kroyce's dismay. Maggie and the family were given Uncle Sternwell's shearing shed to live in."
