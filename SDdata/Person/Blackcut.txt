'''Blackcut''' was a [[dark one]] who was a member of the [[Glumguts]] family of [[dark creeper]]s in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He sought merriment and excitement by going on sneaky adventures and playing pranks on the inhabitants and visitors of Evernight. He was unafraid to do things that challenged or might embarrass the Glumguts or their employers, the [[Netheril|Netherese]]. This put him and the whole family potentially at risk if his antics were discovered.

==Relationships==
Blackcut's father was [[Blackclaw (dark stalker)|Blackclaw]], the terrifying and merciless leader of the Glumguts. Along with his father's young cousins, [[Thrax]] and [[Vynnia]], Blackcut tempted fate by defying his father with his behavior.

He lived at the [[dark creeper enclave]] with the rest of the Glumguts.

==History==
By {{Yearlink|1479}}, Blackcut, Thrax, and Vynnia had caused enough trouble that, if their involvement were ever discovered by the [[ghoul]]s of Evernight, it would put the whole Glumguts family at risk of retaliation from the Netherese. Luckily, Blackclaw had yet to learn what they had done, else he would punish them severely. Blackcut, meanwhile, believed that he would be spared his father's wrath because of their familial connection.
