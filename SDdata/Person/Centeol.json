        "mainbody": "Centeol was a cursed woman whose body was transformed by the elven mage, Jon Irenicus.\nCenteol was once a beautiful and powerful sorceress, with many powers and suitors. She, however, only had eyes for the wizard, Jon Irenicus. She believed that Irenicus was the only man worthy of her affections, and lusted for him greatly, despite the fact that he was happily married to Lady Tanova. Centeol became obsessed with Jon, and plotted to kill his beloved. She was successful in murdering Tanova, and, unsurprisingly, Irenicus was crazed and furious with Centeol.\nJon Irenicus used one of his extensive powers to divine the identity of Tanovas murderer, which correctly pointed to the obsessive sorceress. One day, Irenicus visited her tower and she gladly allowed him entry, and wished to consummate their love. The elven mage quickly disabled the sorceresss magics and cursed her body, which mutated and expanded to a horrific form. Irenicus wouldnt allow Centeol to suffer the same quick fate as his slain lover, and charmed spiders to feed and keep her alive. He confined her to a lair in the Cloakwood forest, to suffer for the rest of her life.\nShe may have been encountered by Gorions Ward in 1368 DR in the lair she was confined to. If so, she told the ward her sorrowful story and of Irenicus. This was the wards first time hearing of this incredibly powerful mage, and noted that \"only a fool would run afoul of mage like that\". (Ironically, Gorions Ward became the arch nemesis of this evil wizard who had found out about the wards Bhaalspawn nature, and desired it for himself. Over the next year, the ward escaped from the wizards prison, and chased him across Faer√ªn, and even to the domain of Bhaal himself. This is to say, the ward certainly ran afoul of the mage, and eventually slew him in combat.) She wished to end her miserable existence, and begged the ward to slay her."
