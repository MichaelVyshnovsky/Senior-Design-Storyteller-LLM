Biggrin was the frost giant tactical commander of Akar Kessells humanoid army.
The massive giant had his upper lip torn off by a wolf, which left him permanently scarred. This wound help gave him his name Big-Grin. It was also implied he had great endurance, since he withstood a hammer blow to the head from Wulfgars Aegis-fang.
He had a magic mirror to communicate instantly from his lair on the slopes of Kelvins Cairn to Akar Kessells crystal fortress.

He was accompanied by a group of verbeeg giants.
In the late 15 century DR, some time after black ice was discovered in Icewind Dale, Biggrin was resurrected as an giant undead monstrosity. This feat was achieved by a group of wights acting on behalf of the returned Akar Kessell.
