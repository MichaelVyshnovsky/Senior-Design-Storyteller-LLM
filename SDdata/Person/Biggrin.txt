''' Biggrin''' was the [[frost giant]] tactical commander of [[Akar Kessell]]'s [[humanoid]] army.
 
==Description==
The massive giant had his upper lip torn off by a [[Wikipedia:wolf|wolf]], which left him permanently scarred. This wound help gave him his name: ''Big-Grin''. It was also implied he had great endurance, since he withstood a [[hammer]] blow to the head from [[Wulfgar|Wulfgar's]] [[Aegis-fang]].

==Possessions==
He had a magic mirror to communicate instantly from his lair on the slopes of [[Kelvin's Cairn]] to Akar Kessell's crystal fortress.

==Relationships==

He was accompanied by a group of [[verbeeg]] [[giant]]s.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some time after ''[[black ice]]'' was discovered in Icewind Dale, Biggrin was resurrected as an giant [[undead]] monstrosity. This feat was achieved by a group of [[wight]]s acting on behalf of the returned Akar Kessell.
