        "mainbody": "Beartrid Winters was the wife of Kalas Winters, who owned the Wolfs Pelt Inn in the Icewind Dale community of Targos.\nThe hostess of the Wolfs Pelt was an attractive human with black hair and brown eyes. Beartrid was 5 ft 4 in (1.6 m) tall and weighed around 130 lb (58.9 kg). \nWhen Beartrid greeted the many patrons of the Wolfs Pelt, her voice was loud and jovial. While greeting guests, she would flirt with customers, but always kept an eye on her daughter, Dorthy Winters. On more than occasion, Beartrid had to stop a fight or other misconduct with her trusty frying pan. \nBeartrid was married to Kalas Winters and had two children, Dorthy and Sims Winters. She was defiantly protective of her family. \nAround Tarsakh, 1369 DR, Beartrid lived with her family in the Ten Towns and kept a watchful eye on every customer who entered the Wolfs Pelt."
