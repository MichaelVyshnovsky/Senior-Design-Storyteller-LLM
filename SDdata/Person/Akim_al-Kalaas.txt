Akim al-Kalaas was a shair and leader of the Unclean in 1367 DR.
He had many nicknames, including the Sage, the Undaunted, Opener of Wisdom, and He Whom the Stars Obey.
Akim behaved like a madman, which was a role he cultivated well to anyone with whom he dealt.
Akim was a tall, thin man who appeared almost emaciated. He had a sharply aquiline nose, wild eyes, and an unkempt beard.
As a devout and zealous follower of Hajama, the Zakharan god of bravery, Akim proved his devotion by tempting the patience of genies.
Akim spent much of his time causing trouble in the cities of Zakhara, hoping to bring an attack against Sarahin where the Shadow Caliph might be killed.
Through Akims power over genies, a truce was arranged between the Everlasting and the Jann of the Haunted Lands.
Because of Grandfather Marwans belief in astrology, Akim came to Sarahins observatory on clear nights to work on astrological charts.
Akim was the only shair to be exiled from Hiyal during the entire history of the city. During his youth, he foolishly attempted to use his magic to coerce the sultana of Hiyal to marry him. This plan was foiled, and Akim was forced to flee the city.
The Shadow Caliph of the Everlasting heard of this and jumped on the opportunity to recruit the young shair into their ranks but only if Akim would stand before an oathbinder genie and swear to loyally serve the Shadow Caliph until Marwan had died or passed his position to a successor. Because of this oath, Akim could not directly harm the Grandfather, but it did nothing to stop him from trying to stir up trouble with the other factions within the Everlasting.
Akim owned a lamp of the four winds, a carpet of fighting, a soundstaff, a wand of illumination, bracers of defense, and a ring of chameleon power.
