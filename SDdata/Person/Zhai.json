        "mainbody": "hai was a half-drow, halfâ€“wood elf rogue of the late 14 century DR.\nShe was able to use twin daggers and had skill at hiding herself.\nZhai was raised in the wood elf village of Cedarleaf by her drow mother and wood elf father, until they were killed indirectly by the slaad Ygorl in a raid against the town.\nFeeling insecure in the home of the wood elves, Zhai left them and became a rogue. She was captured by orcs attacking a town but was freed by Rannek during the battle. Soon thereafter, Zhai acquired a ring of jumping.\nZhai later gained a reputation in Damara around 1368 DR, with Ellery Dragonsbane hearing tales of her and mentioning them to Jarlaxle Baenre.While unnamed, this is presumed to be Zhai, as she is a female half-drow and Demon Stone and Promise of the Witch-King are both written by R.A. Salvatore."
