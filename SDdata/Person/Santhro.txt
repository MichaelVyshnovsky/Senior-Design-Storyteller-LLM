'''Santhro''' was a [[priest]] of [[Garagos]] and an innkeep active in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Santhro was a powerful [[cleric]] and warrior who served as the High Priest of Bezantur's [[Temple of Garagos (Bezantur)|Temple of Garagos]].

==Personality==
Santhro was devoted to Garagos. In the face of doubts about his god's power, he would point to his powerful [[spell]]casting abilities as evidence of Garagos's greatness. He was charismatic enough to dispel his few followers' doubts as well.

He was pragmatic enough to convert his temple into an inn when money became tight&mdash;in which capacity the temple was known as [[Santhro's Rooming House]]&mdash;although he was proud enough that he refused to cook for his guests unless they asked him nicely.

==History==
Santhro opened his Rooming House in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR in order to make extra money in the face of increasing doubt about his deity in Bezantur.
