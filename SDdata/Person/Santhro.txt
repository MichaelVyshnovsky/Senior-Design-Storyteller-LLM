Santhro was a priest of Garagos and an innkeep active in the Thayan city of Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Santhro was a powerful cleric and warrior who served as the High Priest of Bezanturs Temple of Garagos.
Santhro was devoted to Garagos. In the face of doubts about his gods power, he would point to his powerful spellcasting abilities as evidence of Garagoss greatness. He was charismatic enough to dispel his few followers doubts as well.
He was pragmatic enough to convert his temple into an inn when money became tight&mdashin which capacity the temple was known as Santhros Rooming House&mdashalthough he was proud enough that he refused to cook for his guests unless they asked him nicely.
Santhro opened his Rooming House in the mid-to-late 14 century DR in order to make extra money in the face of increasing doubt about his deity in Bezantur.
