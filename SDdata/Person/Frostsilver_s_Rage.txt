Frostsilvers Rage was one of many specters trapped in the Frostsilver Mines in the late 15 century DR.
The specters were characterized by unfocused and unbridled rage. They longed for peace, but also to kill anything that moved.
Following the annihilation of the Frostsilver dwarves by their own creation, the Anvil of Dumathoin, many of their bodies and spirits rose in undeath owing to their overwhelming anguish and rage. This rage only increased and intensified over time.
In the late 15 century DR, the Mines became the site of a treasure-hunting expedition by the Burntbone Horde. These bandits were pursued by adventurers from Waterdeep, who encountered the wrathful specters and destroyed them.
