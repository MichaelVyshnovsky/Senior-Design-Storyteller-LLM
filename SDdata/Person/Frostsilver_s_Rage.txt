'''Frostsilver's Rage''' was one of many [[specter]]s trapped in the [[Frostsilver Mines]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
The specters were characterized by unfocused and unbridled rage. They longed for peace, but also to kill anything that moved.

==History==
Following the annihilation of the Frostsilver [[dwarves]] by their own creation, the [[Anvil of Dumathoin]], many of their bodies and spirits rose in undeath owing to their overwhelming anguish and rage. This rage only increased and intensified over time.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Mines became the site of a treasure-hunting expedition by the [[Burntbone Horde]]. These bandits were pursued by [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]], who encountered the wrathful specters and destroyed them.
