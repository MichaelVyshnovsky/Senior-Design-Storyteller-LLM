        "mainbody": "Haki was a young street acrobat who performed in Huzuz, the City of Delights, around 1367 DR.\nHaki wore a loose sash which, when combined with the streaming bands from his turban, accentuated his gymnastic movements.\nHaki performed energetic and acrobatic routines with the hopes of snaring the eyes of nobles who might offer him employment within their homes.\nHakis performances were only a front. The boy was actually a young holy slayer for the Everlasting. He planned to infiltrate the noble society of Huzuz and await the day he was called by his order to serve.\nHaki was the assistant and pupil of Hamida, a local street dancer."
