        "History": "In [[Nightal]] of [[1357 DR|the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], he visited [[The Drunken Dragon]] [[tavern]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]]. There he met the [[adventurer]] [[Shaless]], who was displaying a selection of curious [[harp]]s and beautiful, [[magic]]al [[blade]]s that she'd apparently looted from [[devil]]s in [[Myth Drannor]]. Maerhult examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor, and to be rare magical items."
