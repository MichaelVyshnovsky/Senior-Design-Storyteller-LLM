Physically, "Goldie" was a standard medium-sized [[war horse]]. However, unlike a normal horse, Goldie was intelligent and could speak. While certainly magical, she was not a [[familiar]], and it is not known how she came to use and understand language.

Goldie had a golden coat with a long white mane. Her ears were long and shapely for a mare,

==Personality==

Goldie was a snarky, stubborn individual who was not afraid to speak her mind.

==Abilities==
Besides her supernatural gift of speech, Golden Dawn was intelligent and fought strategically, giving warnings to her rider. Her large, triangular ears gave her the ability to hear crowds from at least a half mile (0.8 kilometers) away.

==Possessions==
Goldie was fitted with a [[Calimshite]] [[saddle]] that had a high [[Wiktionary:cantle|cantle]].

Unbeknownst to her caretakers, Goldie owned a set of loaded [[dice]].

==Activities==

Zaranda considered Goldie a true friend, Usually, Zaranda admired Golden Dawn's council.

Goldie preferred to mate with stallions who were normal horses, unable to talk.

==History==
In the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Golden Dawn accompanied then-Countess and [[adventuress]] Zaranda Star on a journey from [[Thay]] to [[Zazesspur]] to sell loot.

Besides serving as Zaranda's mount in combat, Goldie once assisted her mistress in taking [[Castle Lutwill]] by pretending to be '''Zizzy, the Wonder Horse''', companion of [[Fyadros]], the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, so that [[Star Protective Services]] could be snuck into the castle at night.

Goldie remained Zaranda's riding mare after the latter was made queen.
