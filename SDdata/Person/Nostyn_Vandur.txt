'''Nostyn Vandur''' was a [[War Wizard of Cormyr]].

==History==
In [[1480 DR]], Nostyn arrived with two [[ironlord]] bodyguards at [[Castle Irlingstar]], just after [[Arclath Delcastle]] and [[Amarune Whitewave]]. He claimed to be sent to lead the investigation into the murder of seneschal [[Marthin Avathnar]] but lord steward [[Gelnur Farland]] mistrusted him.

He together with [[Duth Gulkanun]] and [[Imbrult Longclaws]] tried to stop Gelnur, Lord Delcastle and Amarune but in the fighting was killed.
