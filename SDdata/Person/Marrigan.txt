Marrigan was an ancient Uthgardt werewolf who came to serve Sel√ªne many centuries before the 1300s DR.
She originated from the Gray Wolf tribe, but left them to serve the Moonmaiden in the New Moon Pact, a holy order of lycanthropes. Her deeds were widely celebrated and remembered in the oral traditions of the Uthgardt for centuries onward, as well as being recorded in transcriptions.
