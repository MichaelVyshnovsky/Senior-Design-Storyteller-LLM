Walter Geddstone was an agent of the Harpers from Shadowdale during the 14 century DR. He was a reserved and brave man, who maintained a quiet dignified demeanor. 
In the year 1369 DR, Walter was directed by Elminster to investigate the Zhentarim forces in Snowmantle who had occupied the village for over a decade. He infiltrated the ranks of the slave camp, and observed the Black Networks clear-cutting efforts in the Border Forest.
When a group of adventurers routed the Zhentilar forces, and additionally leveled the entire settlement, by summoning a nature elemental Walter remained within Snowmantle to help the remaining townsfolk rebuild their home.
