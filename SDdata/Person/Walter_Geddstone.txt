'''Walter Geddstone''' was an agent of the [[Harpers]] from [[Shadowdale]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a reserved and brave man, who maintained a quiet dignified demeanor. 

==History==
In the year [[1369 DR]], Walter was directed by [[Elminster]] to investigate the [[Zhentarim]] forces in [[Snowmantle]] who had occupied the village for over a decade. He infiltrated the ranks of the slave camp, and observed the Black Network's clear-cutting efforts in the [[Border Forest]].

When a group of [[adventurer]]s routed the [[Zhentilar]] forces, and additionally leveled the entire settlement, by summoning a [[nature elemental]] Walter remained within Snowmantle to help the remaining townsfolk rebuild their home.
