'''Pavel Shemov''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]] who traveled with [[Dorn Graybrook]], the [[song dragon]] [[Karasendrieth]], and the [[vampire|vampiric]] [[smoke drake]] [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] during the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. He fought against [[Sammaster]] and died freeing the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]'' from the [[lich]]'s influence.

==Description==
He was lanky and blond,{{cite book/The Rage|19|1}}.

==Personality==
As an initiate, he was well aware of how unproven his abilities were. Nonetheless, he was willing to go to great lengths to repay anyone's kindness, even that of gang members, and in more dire moments, he turned out to be confident enough in his reasoning that he was willing to take extreme measures, even going so far as to threaten a lawman while in chains himself.

He liked playing cards anywhere..

==Abilities==
Pavel's observance, intuition, education, and grit were superlative even as a novice.

He used his strongest healing spell to heal [[Karasendrieth|Kara]] on [[Hammer 16]], {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/The Rage|22|1}}. Pavel also knew spells akin to ''[[bless]]'', ''[[shield of faith]]'', and ''[[silence]]''. As of that time, he was not capable of casting a spell akin to ''[[flame strike]]''.{{cite book/The Rage|43|3}}. He could enspell objects with a spell very similar to ''[[daylight]]''.{{cite book/The Rage|54|3}}. He could also cast a spell akin to ''[[remove paralysis]]''.{{cite book/The Rage|109|6}}. He could also cast ''[[neutralize poison]]''; his spell also removed inebriation.{{cite book/The Rage|196|13}} He also had a spell that informed him when someone dissembled, almost certainly ''[[detect lies]]''.{{cite book/The Rage|197|13}} He also employed a spell that made targets heed short commands, akin to ''[[command (spell)|command]]''.{{cite book/The Rage|244|17}}

Pavel could somehow cast ''[[crimson whip of Bane]]''.{{cite book/The Rite|209|9}}
Pavel had become capable of turning away Brimstone by Eleint 25.{{cite book/The Ruin|45|2}}
Lastly, he had grown adroit at undressing women.{{cite book/The Ruin|87|4}}

==Equipment==
Though originally he wore the red and yellow vestments of a priest, Pavel had replaced all of his accoutrements by sturdy wool and leather garments by {{yearlink|1373}}, keeping only his holy symbol of [[Lathander]].{{cite book/The Rage|20|1}}.

Pavel fought with a [[mace]] and divine spells.

==Relationships==
During their shared journey, Pavel and Brimstone often butted heads because of the former's distaste and distrust for the latter's status as an [[undead]] thing.

He had a play-feud with [[Will Turnstone]]..

==History==
===The Silverfish===
Pavel Shemov was once a novice at the [[Temple of the Dawn]] in [[Heliogabalus]]. He made an acquaintance of [[Kosef Demsk]] one summer night while playing cards at [[Rat's End]]; the gangster interceded in his behalf after the novice was accused of cheating. Before two summers had passed, he witnessed the seizing of [[Kosef Demsk]] from his residence at the [[Boot and Whistle]] tavern, and he became involved in the investigation after [[Tara Darag]], an associate of Kosef, asked him to look into it. Kosef stood accused of the murder of [[Mivar Greyman]], a jeweler; his signature blade was found still struck inside the corpser.{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish}}

Encouraged by [[Tana Farag]], he briefly interviewed [[Quendar Horn]] and [[dor Stavask]], both of them companions of Kosef, then impersonated a priest to talk to Kosef himself. When talking to the gangster, he learned that the blade he thought he kept evaporated just as the guards arrived. From there, he reasoned that one of the guards had spoken the words to end the spell; quickly, he honed in on [[Iref Marsk]], a guard who had taken part of the raid, after noticing that he had been spending lavishly recently. Before they could interrogate him, Iref Marsk was slain by a [[barghest]] that attempted to kill Pavel and Tana too. He reasoned the barghest meant that the summoner could only be dor Stavask, as a barghest would not have answered Quendar's summoning.

Tana and he slew Stavask and accidentally burned down his home while sneaking inside, destroying all the evidence; however, when Glar only threatened him instead of indicting him, he realized Glar was a co-conspirator, and threatened to call upon his superiors in the temple to ask him point-blank with truth-detecting spells during the trial. Glar relented of killing Kosef once so-threatened.

===Intervening Years===
After taking his vows, Pavel spent some years as a librarian in the Temple of the Dawn.{{cite book/The Rage|218|15}} After that, he wandered the Moonsea for some time, until he joined with Dorn's band of dragonslayers. Per Dorn, a couple years later, they were joined by [[Will Turnstone]];{{cite book/The Rage|65|4}} the latter had been a slayer too for several years through the {{yearlinkName|1373}}.{{cite book/The Ruin|66|3}}

===Year of Rogue Dragons===
On [[Hammer 23]], after hunting an [[ooze drake]]{{cite book/The Rage|40|3}} Dorn Graybrook and his party learned of a flight of dragons rising to attack Ylraphon.{{cite book/The Rage|45|3}}. By early [[Hammer 24]], the town had been razed, and his band agreed to accompany Kara to Lyrabar in a ship.{{cite book/The Rage|60|3}} Along the way, they spotted signs of another flight of dragons, and began suspecting a full-blown Rage of dragons.{{cite book/The Rage|67|4}} Further evidence mounted as they spotted more destroyed coastal settlements;{{cite book/The Rage|89|6}} during the trip, they were approached by a flight of silver dragons, the first ones Dorn's band had ever seen.{{cite book/The Rage|100|6}} The two dragons, [[Moonwing]] and [[Azhaq]], were looking for Kara, who they explained, was actually a [[song dragon]] named Karasendrieth, whom they intended to take back with them.{{cite book/The Rage|103|6}} Dorn struck at the dragons rather than yield Karasendrieth;{{cite book/The Rage|104|6}} though the ensuing fight led to two casualties amongst the crew, Dorn's team ultimately prevailed.{{cite book/The Rage|110|6}} Kara afterwards explained that a Rage was underway, and the [[gold dragon]] king [[Lareth]] expected it to be one of the worst;{{cite book/The Rage|138|10}} the party, against Graybrook's instincts, chose to aid Kara in finding [[Helder Gorstag]] in [[Lyrabar]].{{cite book/The Rage|140|10}}

In Lyrabar, Will and Pavel consulted Gorstag Helder's landlady, [[Mureene]], about him. After bribing and threatening her, they learned that his room was ransacked by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and then by Mureene herself; Pavel determined, and Mureene confirmed, that Gorstag was taking instruction as a swordsman.{{cite book/The Rage|156-159|12}} This led them to Taegan Nightwind.

The whole party met with Brimstone at his lair, learning he was a [[smoke drake]].{{cite book/The Rage|177|12}} After a brief battle with Brimstone, who was possessed by Sammaster's notes while trying to read them, the vampiric wyrm bade them to attack the Cult of the Dragon and find clues; over Dorn's opposition, the party agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|188-189|12}}. On the evening of [[Ches 14]], the party protected Taegan Nightwind, who set himself out as bait for the Cult by pretending to be drowning his sorrows in too much alcohol.{{cite book/The Rage|193-196|13}} They afterwards interrogated one of the cultists that they captured, learning that the cult hid in a dungeon beneath a tannery.{{cite book/The Rage|198|13}} After a fight, they captured the [[Wearer of Purple]] [[Cylla Morieth]] and managed to learn of Sammaster's plans for the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|206|13}}

Taegan Nightwind agreed to petition Queen Sambryl to send warriors to fight the Cult of the Dragon close to Lyrabar, to which she ultimately agreed.{{cite book/The Rage|236-237|16}} Dorn, Kara, and the others instead left for [[Elmwood]], which they found to be under [[Zhentarim]] occupation.{{cite book/The Rage|240|17}} After the fight, they joined [[Thoyanna Jorgadaul]] and other authorities from town in a small grove to which a small bird led them.{{cite book/The Rage|249|17}} There, after learning of the Zhentarim activities through the area, they decided to break their control over the town, blaming dragons for any damage.{{cite book/The Rage|254|17}} During their following raid, Dorn managed to secure a craft.{{cite book/The Rage|278|18}} They took the craft to Thentia, and then to Northkeep, where they were joined by [[Chatulio]].{{cite book/The Rage|307|20}} After a battle against Sammaster's guardians, Dorn pleaded with the ghosts to allow his company to search the ruins. Surprisingly, he was heard out.{{cite book/The Rage|330|22}} After days of searching, they finally located a number of reliefs that showed the origins of the Rage.{{cite book/The Rage|339|22}}

Pavel and Will traveled to Hulburg on their own, arriving on [[Mirtul 1]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons/The Prisoner of Hulburg|345}} There, they were attacked while at sea, and later learned that the Zhentarim were using a trapped [[emerald dragon]], [[Vercevoran]], as part of a network to monitor the Moonsea.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons/The Prisoner of Hulburg|354}} Later they released Vercevoran, who rewarded them the next day by telling them about the [[King-Killer Star]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons/The Prisoner of Hulburg|371}}

On Mirtul 19, Pavel Shemov and Will Turnstone came across the war party of Yagoth One-Eye, who were still injured from fighting a wyrm.{{cite book/The Rite|49|1}}. They made contact a week later, in Mirtul 25, after helping them fight off a dragon.{{cite book/The Rite|64|3}} Yagoth ultimately agreed to guide Will and Pavel to a ruin he knew of.{{cite book/The Rite|74|3}}

On Kythorn 2, Pavel, Will, Yagoth, and the latter's forces arrived at the ruined temple to Vaprak of the Claws; they sought to search through the ruin.{{cite book/The Rite|122|6}} After a fight against some [[squamous spewer]]s, Yagoth double-crossed his guests and captured Pavel; Will managed to escape.{{cite book/The Rite|139|6}} Pavel was kept captive by Yagoth, who tried to get him to find something he could personally use in the tablets kept within the ruined temple; though he ran out of tablets by Kythorn 6, the ogre kept him alive and bade him continue for good measure. He also broke Pavel's leg and splinted it wrong, using magic to keep him hobbled, as well as prevented him from regaining spells every dawn since his capture.{{cite book/The Rite|165|8}} Meanwhile, Will, who was in no condition to fight, lured a flight of green dragons to the temple in order to create a distraction.{{cite book/The Rite|173|8}} He was able to slay Yagoth and free Pavel shortly afterwards.{{cite book/The Rite|184|8}}

On Kythorn 15, Pavel and Will were retrieved from Thar by [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]], who bore them to Damara; the drake had learned of King Dragonsbane's state, and meant to counter it so that Kara and Dorn were able to retrieve lore from the country unimpeded. However, Pavel made a note of the amulet which Brimstone bore, considering it was likely what allowed it to stray far from its hoard.{{cite book/The Rite|217-128|9}} On Kythorn 25, Pavel and Will, together with Pavel's old master, Patriarch Kovor Gemetsk, met with queen Christine Dragonsbane to propose them Brimstone's plan.{{cite book/The Rite|225-228|11}} The next evening, Brimstone brought them, alongside a number of Dragonsbane's men, to the Plane of Shadow, to break the curse on Dragonsbane.{{cite book/The Rite|236|11}} Though Brimstone knew the curse, he needed Pavel's aid to break it in the end.{{cite book/The Rite|245-246|11}}

By Midsummer, the party had returned to Thentia, where considerable progress had been made in decoding Sammaster's notes.{{cite book/The Rite|329-333|E}}

On Eleint 12, Taegan and Jivex had rejoined Dorn's party, and taken to exploring the steppes of ancient [[Narfell]], following Sammaster's explorations. Despite carrying a token of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s favor, they were attacked by a Far Quey raiding party.{{cite book/The Ruin|14|1}} Kara attempted to lure in the Nars for a friendly talk, but they attacked when [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] attacked them, unbeknownst to her; they broke off after Pavel rescued their captain.{{cite book/The Ruin|32-34|1}} Afrer the conversation with the Nars, they learned of the [[Hermit]].{{cite book/The Ruin|35|1}} After a battle, the Hermit related upon Dorn's party that it had realized, during the first Rage, that the elves had built a citadel in Novularond, but knew little beyond that.{{cite book/The Ruin|57|2}}

Raryn rescued Joylin from the tirichiks on Marpenoth 14; later, they went to Raryn's home village.{{cite book/The Ruin|70|3}} There, his brother Wurik poisoned all of them; when the Queen's servants arrived, they slew Wurik for trying to hide his brother Raryn.{{cite book/The Ruin|79|3}} On 17 Marpenoth, Iyraclea charmed Pavel and, though she was trying to learn of Sammaster and the rage, she almost killed him; he narrowly broke free, and she explained her interest in the Rage.{{cite book/The Ruin|88-89|4}}

On 27 Marpenoth, Pavel's party, pushed by Iyraclea, arrived at a citadel in Novularond.{{cite book/The Ruin|116-117|6}} Later that night, Zethrindor arrived with Brimstone, and attacked Iyraclea, considering she had broken faith with Sammaster.{{cite book/The Ruin|122-123|6}} Through the battle, one of Zethrindor's spells appeared to annihilate Karasendrieth and Pavel had to talk Dorn out of a suicide attack against the dragon; instead, they escaped in the commotion.{{cite book/The Ruin|135|6}} Some time after the victory, Zethrindor ordered his forces to find and retrieve Dorn's party.{{cite book/The Ruin|137|6}} Though an ice wyrm came after them, they managed to narrowly defeat it.{{cite book/The Ruin|148|6}}

On 8 Uktar, after nearly sneaking out in the morning, dorn noticed several people in white clothes attempt to ambush his comrades in their sleep. Those were warriors of Sossal; dorn stopped them long enough for Pavel to defuse the situation.{{cite book/The Ruin|161|7}} On Uktar 16, Zethrindor maneuvered his dragons to block Stival Chergoba's forces from joining Madislak Pemsk's, and pincer the latter's,{{cite book/The Ruin|196-198|8}} after Stival Chergoba's group ran into his main force.{{cite book/The Ruin|191-193|8}}

On Uktar 17, Pavel got up to a meal of lentils and beef stock soup, after having slept through most of the day because of the previous day's forced march, by which they managed to successfully reach Madislak Pemsk's group ahead of Zethrindor's army.{{cite book/The Ruin|203-205|9}} during the fighting, Will Turnstone had an idea, and with Jivex's help, he reached the enemy commanders under Zethrindor and informed them that Iyraclea had been killed by Zethrindor.{{cite book/The Ruin|223-226|9}} Zethrindor, upon noticing, decided to confirm it.{{cite book/The Ruin|228-229|9}} The dracolich accepted a challenge from Will Turnstone to fight dorn's party and Madislak Pemsk, wagering that the losing party's army would surrender, advised that if he chose to forfeit the challenge, he would look weak.{{cite book/The Ruin|238-239|10}}

Ultimately, albeit Zethrindor slew Madislak Pemsk,{{cite book/The Ruin|244|10}} and may have slain dorn's group, the ice giants in his army struck at him, sensing weakness, and destroyed him;{{cite book/The Ruin|247|10}} even the dragons in his army chose to flee after his death. Stival Chergoba discovered that Natali, who'd been injured during the fight, had actually survived.{{cite book/The Ruin|248|10}} Zethrindor's body was burned through the night; per Pavel Shemov, he was not likely to have cached bodies to inhabit after death.{{cite book/The Ruin|252|10}}

dorn and his party returned just in time for their meeting on the Feast of the Moon. The meeting was attended by a number of dragons, including Nexus, Tamarand, Azhaq, Moonwing, LLimark, Wardancer, Vingdavalac, and the Talons of Justice, amongst other dragons, and the wizards of Thentia, amongst them Firefingers, Scattercloak, darvin Kordeion, Sureene Aumratha, Baerimel, and Jannatha Goldenshield. With no other ideas, the metallic dragons and the wizards of Thentia attempted a Grand divination; the ritual failed, instead leading to the death of [[Moonwing]].{{cite book/The Ruin|257-261|11}} Pavel Shemov finally proposed attempting to use Brimstone's hoard near Lyrabar as a focus for contacting Brimstone's necklace and Brimstone himself, under the assumption the drake had made it through the gate.{{cite book/The Ruin|264-265|11}}

Kara finally lost her battle to Sammaster's rage on 5 Nightal, when she attacked her companions for trying to stop her from suicidally striking at the tarterian wyrms in the valley, believing she'd kill them if she didn't kill herself. Brimstone decided to stop her, kill her, and slake his thirst by drinking her blood.{{cite book/The Ruin|270-273|12}} They were stopped by the sudden arrival of the tarterians, and then by the metallic wyrms that had teleported themselves through Brimstone's hoard in Lyrabar.{{cite book/The Ruin|277-278|12}} After defeating the tarterians, the dragons and mages there managed to break through Sammaster's ward.{{cite book/The Ruin|283|12}}

On 6 Uktar, Sammaster called upon pacts with a number of wyrms from other planes to defend the ''dracorage mythal''.{{cite book/The Ruin|289|12}} In the middle of the battle, Pavel led the majority of the non-dragons into the fortress, to try and break the Rage while Sammaster was still occupied.{{cite book/The Ruin|297|13}} Taegan Nightwind and Jivex joined them afterwards when they decided to block off a howling dragon from pursuing them into the fortress.{{cite book/The Ruin|300|13}}

Per Pavel Shemov, Sammaster's modification of the mythal was based on channeling abyssal force through his own phylactery to feed the dracorage. That would make it difficult to damage the mythal through the original counterspell, but it would also render it vulnerable to a cleric's ability to turn undead.{{cite book/The Ruin|323-324|13}} The mythal's protections had also been augmented with wards that created tumors within intruders who got too close, and caused extensive bleeding, as well as deal numerous kinds of damage.{{cite book/The Ruin|328|13}} Pavel managed to break the mythal after five tries. Though he managed to destroy the phylactery, he sustained fatal wounds in the process.{{cite book/The Ruin|330|13}}
