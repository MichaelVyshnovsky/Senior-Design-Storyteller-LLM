'''Buldegas Mhaerkoon''' was a [[human]] man living in the cities of [[Wheloon]] and [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was the proprietor of the [[Wyvern Watch Inn]] and another inn.

==History==
Buldegas was formerly a warrior.

He was the long-time owner of the Wyvern Watch Inn, in business by [[1358 DR]]. During the [[Time of Troubles]], he gave shelter to [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], [[Midnight]], and [[Adon]], hiding them from their foes.

He continued to manage the Wyvern through [[1369 DR]].

Following the devastation of the neighboring city of [[Arabel]] during the [[Goblin War]] in [[1370 DR]], Buldegas chose to relocate there and build a new inn. He took away his money and some of his best employees. He was only recently gone by [[1374]]. He left his two daughters, Asanta and Baerill, in charge of the Wyvern.

==Description==
Buldegas Mhaerkoon was overweight and red-faced.

==Personality==
He was a cynical man but generally kind and generous. He was often patriotic to Cormyr, and always an entrepreneur.

==Relationships==
Buldegas had two daughters, [[Asanta]] & [[Baerill]].

==Activities==
Buldegas made the Wyvern Watch Inn successful with his low prices, though he also went for low quality. He watered down the [[beer]] and [[wine]], and instructed his daughters to do the same, though they conveniently forgot to do so.
