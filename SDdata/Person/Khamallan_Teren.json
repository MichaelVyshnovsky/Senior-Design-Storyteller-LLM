        "mainbody": "Khamallan Teren was a proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Malar, who chiefly inhabited his divine realm, the Land of the Hunt.\nKhamallan was a very huge man with clawed hands, but could move his body with grace comparable to that of a mountain lion.\nKhamallan was a very deceitful, evasive, overall dangerous and evil man. His only joys in life were hunting and the evisceration of his prey. He was willing to talk with others, though his eyes always measured people as if searching for the most devastating place to claw at them.\nKhamallan showed absolute loyalty to Malar, never talking back to him or asking questions, and he reveled in gutting those who dared to do so. In general he took pleasure in tearing out the innards of his enemies.\nBeing a proxy of Malar, a god of the hunt, Khamallan was quite skilled in tracking down his prey.\nThis proxy possessed a power key that worked on all planes of existence, an item that was gifted to him by his deity Malar.\nKhamallan was infamous among the inhabitants of the Land of the Hunt and those in the wider plane of Carceri. Whenever he went hunting in the canyons of Colothys or the shallows of Porphatys other proxies would hide, petitioners would flee in terror, and even the gehreleth would do their best to steer clear of him."
