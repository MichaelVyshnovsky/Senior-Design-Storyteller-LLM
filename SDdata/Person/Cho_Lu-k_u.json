        "mainbody": "Cho Lu-ku was a wizard who once lived in Koryo.\nCho Lu-ku died in the Dang Caverns and cursed its tunnels. This may have led to the evil monsters that lurked there.The text states only that Cho Lu-ku cursed the tunnel and it harbors monsters. There is no direct cause-and-effect relation between these statements, but their proximity implies a connection. It also refers only to a single tunnel, but also mentions hundreds of entrances, so this is assumed to be in error and that there are multiple tunnels.\nMeo Cha heard of this story from his old tutor some time before 1350 DR."
