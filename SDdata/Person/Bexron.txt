Bexron was a glabrezu in Maerimydra.
As of 1491 DR, Bexron and two bar-lgura watched the entrance to the Undying Temple but in truth they relaxed with a good smoke and boasted to each other.
Bexron was a ferocious demon but the madness spread by demon lord Grazzt had changed him into a lazy and somewhat friendly creature. Bexron now looked for new experiences to luxuriate in.
