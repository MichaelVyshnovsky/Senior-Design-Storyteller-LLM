        "mainbody": "'''Almari bint-Kafira''', or the '''Shark of Suq Bay''', was a notorious [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] pirate in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}\n\nShe flew under a flag depicting a black [[Shark|hammerhead shark]] on a sea-green background. The sight of this flag was enough for most ships to strike their colors because of a unique deal that Almari offered.",
        "Activities": "Almari's pirate fleet consisted of five vesselsâ€”two [[galleon]]s and three [[wikipedia:en:sambuk|sambuks]]. Over 400 [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] manned these vessels.\n\nUnique compared to other pirates who favored absolute butchery, Almari preferred to rob a ship and let it go so she could rob it again in the future. Merchants sailing on [[Zakharan seas|Suq Bay]] knew that if they struck their colors and gave Almari a third of their cargo, then they would be allowed to continue their journey unmolested. Any ship offering resistance was rightly obliterated to the last man.",
        "History": "Almari's flag used to depict a shark jumping a ship, but poor artwork made the shark appear more like a dolphin. One brave [[ajami]] named [[Michal Bluestar]] taunted her by calling her the \"Dread Porpoise.\" Almari was impressed with his bravery and offered to spare the wizard's life if he promised to make her a new flag. Michal accepted the bargain and ultimately joined Almari as a member of her crew.",
        "Possessions": "The ''[[Leap for the Throat]]'' was Almari's flagship. She communicated with the captains of the other ships in her fleet with ''[[message ring]]s'' so they could coordinate their attacks and surround targets.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Almari was an agent for Prince [[Tannous al-Assad]]. The two communicated via a ''[[mirror of mental prowess]]'' held by one of her mages."
