        "mainbody": "'''Curuvar the Brazen''' was a [[wizard]] from [[Loudwater]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Curuvar had a long black beard and appeared to be middle-aged as of {{Yearlink|1479}}. He dressed in very stereotypical wizardly fashion, including a pointed hat and a robe adorned with a star and moon pattern. He had a [[staff]] topped with a [[petrified]] [[raven]].",
        "Personality": "The eccentric wizard was suspicious of newcomers to the town, but was a valuable ally when his trust was earned. While we was not much of a talker&mdash;especially around those he did not trust&mdash;Curuvar was fond of stating the phrase, \"by [[Mystra|Mystra's]] lost spell\". \n\nHe was knowledgeable about history, and was one of the few people who knew the truth about the [[Ogre King]] who had terrorized the region in the early 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Activities": "As of 1479 DR, Curuvar was seeking knowledge on the dreaded [[Dire Wood]] and on [[Draigdurroch Tower]]. \n\nHe frequented the [[Green Tankard]] tavern in Loudwater.",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, Curuvar infiltrated the [[Barrow of the Ogre King]] and stole the ''[[horn totem]]'' from the resident [[goblin]]s, prompting them to launch a raid on Loudwater to retrieve the item. In response, Curuvar proceeded to seek [[adventurer]]s to go and steal the goblins' other treasure, the ''[[skull totem]]''."
