        "Description": "Bruno was a [[gold dwarf]] with a dark brown skin tone, dark brown hair, and blue eyes. He kept his scalp and face clean-shaven.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the time [[Captain Grisly]] was replaced by the [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid. During that time, Bruno Indomicus found himself in debt to the establishment, unable to pay. Captain Grisly and Bosun [[Gannet]] put the dwarf to work on sorting produce for the tavern's kitchen until Bruno's debt was fully paid off. Bruno was also a gambler and owed [[Baldur's Bones]] money to [[Brinks]], a criminal element of the Lower City. Brinks demanded Bosun Gannet chop Bruno's finger off as a warning, but the innkeeper turned the request down, offering instead to buy the dwarf's debt out."
