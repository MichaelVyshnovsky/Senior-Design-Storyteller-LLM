        "mainbody": "Yvonnel Baenre, often known only as Matron Baenre or simply Baenre, was the matron mother of House Baenre in the city of Menzoberranzan. She led her house and the city itself with an uncanny strength bred from deceitful ambition.\nMatron Baenre had lost much of the beauty she possessed while young at the end of her life, she looked haggard, with a patchwork of wrinkles across her face and her hair was thin.\nYvonnel Baenre was born in .\nSome time in the past, she encountered Gandalug Battlehammer, the first king of Mithral Hall, and his bodyguard Crowmower Pwent. During this confrontation, she managed to entrap Gandalugs soul in one of his teeth that had been knocked loose.\nDuring the following two thousand years, she had many children and became the most powerful matron mother known to Menzoberranzan, with influences stretching across the Underdark and with so much of Lolths favor bestowed upon her that she may have been rightly seen as Lolths chosen prophetess. Several decades prior to her death, she oversaw the rise to power of House DoUrden, even going out on a limb (by drow standards) to help them defend their home while they continued their search for their blasphemous son Drizzt when they had little to no favor with Lolth.\nAt the very end of her life, she put into motion the plan she had been nurturing for two thousand years an all-or-nothing assault upon Mithral Hall, the location, layout, and old defenses having been gleaned from the tormented spirit of Gandalug. Initially, things seemed to be going well. In 1357 DR, she ended up with Drizzt DoUrden as her prisoner, but then Catti-brie rescued him with the aid of Artemis Entreri (and Jarlaxle). As a parting gift, they sent a heavy stalactite crashing through the house chapel during a ceremony wherein Lolths blessing was asked for the invasion of Mithral Hall.\nAfter that, the Time of Troubles hit Toril in 1358 DR, further stalling Matron Baenres plans. During this time, she came close to losing her life when House Oblodra decided to abandon Lolth and attempted to conquer Menzoberranzan. With the balor Errtus aid (courtesy of a deal made by the goddess Lolth), she managed to wipe House Oblodra off the map (and into the Clawrift).\nAfter the Time of Troubles ended, she led an army gathered from all houses in the city on her long-awaited conquest. Though they might have succeeded had drow not been drow, her plans were ruined by the valor of the defenders, dissent and desertion in her ranks, and by the unexpectedly successful headhunt by Drizzts party. When Errtus appointed general opened a chest with a dead-magic gem inside, all magic failed and Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre fell to the floor from her glowdisc and was killed by an enraged Bruenor Battlehammer.\nIn 1484 DR, Yvonnels body was in the possession of her son, Gromph Baenre. Her head had been given to Gromph by Jarlaxle the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp used it to psychically absorb her personality and pass some of it on to Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre, Yvonnels daughter.\nGromphs child (with Minolin Fey) was to be named Yvonnel after his mother and groomed as Quenthels (and thus Yvonnels) successor.\nYvonnel Baenre had twenty children in her life, fifteen of whom were priestesses. Her most notable children included Quenthel, the mistress of Arach-Tinilith and her eventual successor Gromph, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan Triel, her immediate successor and Jarlaxle, her rogue son and leader of Bregan Daerthe. Other children included Doquaio, Dantrag, BladenKerst, Vendes, SosUmptu, and the youngest son Berginyon.\nDuring the last decade of her life, the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp served as Yvonnels duvall (secret advisor)."
