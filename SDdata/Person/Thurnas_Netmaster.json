He believed the sheik's adventurers were not just wanderers who came across the oasis, and would have preferred to capture them for sale, but preferred to keep a low profile at the moment, since the dervish fanatics he had tried to deal with had grown upset with him{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|71}} Per [[Hogan Underwood]], Thurnas possessed a sand sled and used it occassionally.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|72}}\n\nNetmaster had sent an assassin to capture the bride, [[Zorath Blackblade]]; he had not found her. The slaver was still looking for her, though he believed the dervishes were holding her already and were trying to back out on their agreement."
