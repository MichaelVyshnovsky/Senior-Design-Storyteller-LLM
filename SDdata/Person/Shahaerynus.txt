'''Shahaerynus''' was a [[drow]] sage who documented the history of his race.

==Activities==
Shahaerynus dedicated time in an attempt to document the drow of the [[Underdark]]. This, however, was a difficult task, as [[Lolth]]-worshiping drow tended to "rewrite history" by pretending traitors to the Spider Queen never existed.

==History==
Long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the sage penned a tome known as ''[[The High History of the Drow]]''. Many years later, [[Elminster]]'s apprentice, [[Susprina Arkhenneld]], began work on a sequel to the sage's great work.
