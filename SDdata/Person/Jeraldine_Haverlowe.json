        "mainbody": "Jeraldine Haverlowe was a soothsayer of high social standing from the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nDuring her long, illustrious career, Jeraldine Haverlowe kept a detailed record of case studies that eventually were compiled and printed as the book called Notes from a Soothsayer. One notable case Jeraldine became involved in was a nobleman and a good acquaintance of hers. The nobleman from Waterdeep employed the soothsayer to advise him in the matters of love and money. One time, the noble recounted his encounter with a sword-wielding ochre-skinned humanoid. It had elfish ears, splotched skin, and a nose of a \"half-rotted corpse.\" The alien creature pointed his silver sword at the magically restrained noble and asked a question in an unknown tongue. Unable to communicate, the \"Ochre Omen\" spoke in Common, asking the terrified noble youth what plane it was, as the man blacked out in terror. In the end, Jeraldine could offer little insight into the strange encounter and instead prophesied it to be an omen of doubled crops that year. Haverlowe convinced the nobleman that the alien creature was nothing but his inner demon manifested in the noblemans mind."
