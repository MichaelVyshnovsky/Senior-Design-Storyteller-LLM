Dasharra Keldabar was a Shield dwarf who lived in Fireshear sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
She lived north of Fireshear on a ridge overlooking the sea, where she raised griffons, trained them to be ridden, and taught others how to ride. To protect her precious mounts, she kept six Zhentarim mercenaries in her service. In addition to training those willing to ride griffons for a fee of 250 gp, Dasharra allowed her mounts to be flown within a few hundred miles radius for a fee of 25 gp per person per day.
Prior to retiring to Fireshear, Dasharra was a civilar (captain) in Waterdeeps Griffon Cavalry. 
By the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, she had retired and joined the Emerald Enclave. During her retirement in Fireshear, her main dwelling was an underground hovel with a low, sturdy wooden shelter adjacent that held the griffons.
During her retirement, a ship full of frost giants launched an attack on the town of Fireshear and Dasharra helped in its defense by providing aerial support via heavy crossbow from atop her griffon Screecher. She was also helped to repel the giants by Minsc, Boo, Krydle, Delina, Shandie, Nerys, and Saarvin.
