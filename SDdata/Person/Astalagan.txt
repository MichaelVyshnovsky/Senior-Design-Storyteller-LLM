'''Astalagan''' was a [[bronze dragon]] who was mentioned in the legends about [[Stormwreck Isle]].

==History==
Astalagan was one of the three great [[metallic dragon]]s who defeated the great [[red dragon]] [[Sharruth]] long before the late 1400s [[DR]]. Legends say that he, the [[gold dragon]] [[Clyssavar]], and the [[brass dragon]] [[Turadaer]] joined forces to battle Sharruth and confined her beneath the ocean floor.

It is unknown how exactly Astalagan died, but it was centuries prior to the late 1400s DR. A cloister called [[Dragon's Rest]] was built on the site of his death in the cliffs of Stormwreck Isle and it was protected by the remaining draconic magic. In the late 15{{th}} century, Dragon's Rest's elder was [[Runara]], a bronze dragon disguised in [[human]] form and Astalagan's daughter.

In the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} a [[blue dragon]] [[Dragon aging|wyrmling]] named [[Sparkrender]] had taken up residence in the [[Clifftop Observatory]] on Stormwreck Isle and attempted to harness the power of the island's fallen dragons. For this cause, he ordered his [[kobold]] followers [[Mek]] and [[Minn (kobold)|Minn]] to build and paint sculptures of the five great dragons, Astalagan among them. When a group of adventurers and a bronze wyrmling named [[Aidron]] attempted to stop Sparkrender's ritual, the effigy of Astalagan gave them 'Astalagan's Blessing', restoring their health and surrounding them with warmth.
