        "mainbody": "'''Aberdeen Krestner''' was one of the three guildmasters of the [[Diviner's Guild]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Aberdeen was a [[gnome]] who stood roughly {{SI|3'1\"|ft-in}} tall and weighed around {{SI|57|lbs.|k}} at the page of eighty-six. He had sandy blond hair and icy blue eyes.",
        "Personality": "Aberdeen was a very mischievous and fun loving individual, whose actions were often unpredictable when it came to anything but finances. His face persistently bore a sneer and his eyes burned with a strange glee. He was also a genius when it came to numbers.",
        "Abilities": "Aberdeen was a [[diviner]] type of [[mage]] and knew how to cast the following [[spell]]s:\n:''[[advanced illusion]]'', ''[[audible glamer]]'', ''[[blindness]]'', ''[[blur]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[clairaudience]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[contact other plane]]'', ''[[deafness]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect scrying]]'', ''[[dream]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[false vision]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[illusionary script]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', ''[[magic mirror]]'', ''[[minor creation]]'', ''[[Nystul's magical aura]]'', ''[[rainbow pattern]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[Shadow evocation|shadow magic]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', ''[[true seeing]]'', and ''[[vacancy]]''.\n\nBeyond his prowess in spellcasting, aberdeen was proficient in the art of engineering and cutting gems.",
        "Possessions": "Aberdeen possessed a wide variety of [[robe]]s in different styles. Most of them were long and flowing with a golden trim, though all were the color white, and he would wear a different one each day. In terms of [[magic items]] he owned a ''[[cloak of protection]] +4'', a ''[[deck of many things]]'', a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +4'', and a ''[[wand of illusion]]''.",
        "Activities": "The guildmaster duty that Aberdeen took care of in the Diviner's Guild was the handling of financial transactions. He kept meticulous records and found many ways that his guild could save money.",
        "History": "Aberdeen was born in [[Eshpurta]], [[Amn]] to a family of renowned jewelers and was expected to continue the tradition. However, he quickly grew to be bored of the profession. When he one day overheard of an adventuring company from [[Calimshan]] planning an expedition, he jumped at the chance to join them.\n\nDuring one adventure with his partner [[Rial Potjian]], when fighting [[drow]] they encountered within the ruined city of [[Monrativi Teshy Mir]], they caused a [[wild magic]] surge that transported them both far away to the ruins [[Myth Drannor]]. Soon after fighting their way out of Myth Drannor, they met a fellow diviner by the name of [[Saldo Presto]]. They came to adventure together for nearly a decade, until deciding to settle down in the city of Ravens Bluff. There they got a residence close to the city's Diviner's Guild and devoted much of their time to the study of [[tome]]s.\n\nAfter thwarting the plans of a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] that they had overheard in a tavern, the trio earned the respect of the [[Lord/Lady Mayor of Ravens Bluff|Lord Mayor]] [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]] and were elected guildmasters of the Diviner's Guild by unanimous vote."
