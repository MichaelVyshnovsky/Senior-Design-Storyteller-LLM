He had sandy blond hair and icy blue eyes.\nAberdeen was a very mischievous and fun loving individual, whose actions were often unpredictable when it came to anything but finances. His face persistently bore a sneer and his eyes burned with a strange glee. He was also a genius when it came to numbers.\nAberdeen was a diviner type of mage and knew how to cast the following spells\nadvanced illusion, audible glamer, blindness, blur, change self, clairaudience, clairvoyance, contact other plane, deafness, detect evil, detect magic, detect scrying, dream, ESP, false vision, fear, illusionary script, legend lore, magic mirror, minor creation, Nystuls magical aura, rainbow pattern, read magic, shadow magic, spectral force, true seeing, and vacancy.\nBeyond his prowess in spellcasting, aberdeen was proficient in the art of engineering and cutting gems.\nAberdeen possessed a wide variety of robes in different styles. Most of them were long and flowing with a golden trim, though all were the color white, and he would wear a different one each day. In terms of magic items he owned a cloak of protection +4, a deck of many things, a ring of invisibility, a ring of protection +4, and a wand of illusion.\nThe guildmaster duty that Aberdeen took care of in the Diviners Guild was the handling of financial transactions. He kept meticulous records and found many ways that his guild could save money.\nAberdeen was born in Eshpurta, Amn to a family of renowned jewelers and was expected to continue the tradition. However, he quickly grew to be bored of the profession. When he one day overheard of an adventuring company from Calimshan planning an expedition, he jumped at the chance to join them.\nDuring one adventure with his partner Rial Potjian, when fighting drow they encountered within the ruined city of Monrativi Teshy Mir, they caused a wild magic surge that transported them both far away to the ruins Myth Drannor. Soon after fighting their way out of Myth Drannor, they met a fellow diviner by the name of Saldo Presto. They came to adventure together for nearly a decade, until deciding to settle down in the city of Ravens Bluff. There they got a residence close to the citys Diviners Guild and devoted much of their time to the study of tomes.\nAfter thwarting the plans of a Red Wizard of Thay that they had overheard in a tavern, the trio earned the respect of the Lord Mayor Charles Oliver OKane and were elected guildmasters of the Diviners Guild by unanimous vote."
