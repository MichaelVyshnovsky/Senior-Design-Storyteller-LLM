'''Rinthar''' was a wheelwright in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the owner of [[Rinthar's Wagonworks]].

==Description==
He was an ageing man of few words but a gruff temperament.

==Activities==
A skilled wheelwright, Rinthar was most known for crafting plain sturdy wheels. He would steam and bend [[ash]] wood into shape out in the workshop's yard. In addition, he and his six young apprentices repaired [[wagon]]s, usually to a rough but serviceable quality.

Moreover, Rinthar was an expert on wood and could identify even rare or ancient specimens, and furthermore could apply appropriate weatherproofing.

His house stood in the center of the settlement from his smithy, between the streets called the Rise and the Back and standing between the home of [[Shondrin]] and [[The Bargewright Inn]] itself.<ref><ref>
