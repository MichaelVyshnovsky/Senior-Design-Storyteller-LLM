Rinthar was a wheelwright in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was the owner of Rinthars Wagonworks.
He was an ageing man of few words but a gruff temperament.
A skilled wheelwright, Rinthar was most known for crafting plain sturdy wheels. He would steam and bend ash wood into shape out in the workshops yard. In addition, he and his six young apprentices repaired wagons, usually to a rough but serviceable quality.
Moreover, Rinthar was an expert on wood and could identify even rare or ancient specimens, and furthermore could apply appropriate weatherproofing.
His house stood in the center of the settlement from his smithy, between the streets called the Rise and the Back and standing between the home of Shondrin and The Bargewright Inn itself.
