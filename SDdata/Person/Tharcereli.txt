Tharcereli was the ulitharid Creedmaster of the Loretakers Creed of Oryndoll in 1370 DR and 1372 DR.
Tharcereli had an abiding hunger for knowledge but never shared this knowledge with non-illithids.
Tharcereli was a member of the citys Elder Concord during the Time of Troubles and Ilsensine gave it tendril rings of Ilsensine. As the leader of the Creed of the Loretakers, Tharcereli was the third most powerful individual of the city, behind only the Encephalithid and the high cleric of Ilsensine.
