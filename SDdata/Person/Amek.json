        "Description": "Amek had purple-black skin and two large horns that extended nearly straight upwards. He dressed in simple clothing.",
        "History": "Like other Elturian tieflings, Amek was kicked out of the holy capital of [[Elturgard]] following the event known as [[the Descent]], where it was briefly transported to [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]] during the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Amek joined the group of tieflings headed west along the [[Risen Road]] towards [[Baldur's Gate]], but were then forced to seek aid from the [[druid]]s of [[Emerald Grove]] or risk death by [[goblinoid]] attack.\n\nAs tension grew between the druids and their new tiefling neighbors, Amek became aggrieved at the perceived lack of concern for his people's well-being. These feeling intensified as acting head druid [[Kagha]] prepared the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'' to kick the tieflings out and keep hidden the grove from others on the [[Sword Coast]]."
