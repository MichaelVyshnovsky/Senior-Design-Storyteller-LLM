'''Danton''' was a [[tiefling]] [[druid]] and a [[peacock]] breeder who lived and died in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Danton was a tiefling man with garish blue skin, long blue hair, and short horns. He had glowing green eyes.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Danton was a refined druid who attempted to escape approaching cultists of [[the Absolute]] whist in the shape of one of the peacocks he cared for. This attempt was in vain and ended in Danton's demise in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Shortly after, he ended up among the dozen individuals plucked from the [[Fugue Plane]], chosen by the entity [[Withers]] to aid in his campaign against the [[Dead Three]]. Like other "hirelings," Danton forgot his living tongue and could only communicate through Withers' words.
