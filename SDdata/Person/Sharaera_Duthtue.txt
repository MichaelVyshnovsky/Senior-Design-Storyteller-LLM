Sharaera Duthtue was a moon elf wizard and a member of the Company of the Cloak in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was enamored with the partys leader, as well as her magical teacher, Mhair Gulzrabban. Mhair reminded the elf of her deceased uncle Phondelarrus as they were both supreme actors and manipulators.
Although she would not betray Mhair, Sharaera would leave him the moment he seriously hurt her or any other elves..
