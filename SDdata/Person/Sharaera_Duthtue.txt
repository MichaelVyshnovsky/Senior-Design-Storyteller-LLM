'''Sharaera Duthtue''' was a [[moon elf]] [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Company of the Cloak]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was enamored with the party's leader, as well as her magical teacher, [[Mhair Gulzrabban]]. Mhair reminded the elf of her deceased uncle [[Phondelarrus]] as they were both supreme actors and manipulators.

Although she would not betray Mhair, Sharaera would leave him the moment he seriously hurt her or any other [[elves]]..
