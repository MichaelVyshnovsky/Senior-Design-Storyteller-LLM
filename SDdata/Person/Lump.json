It also struck Scratches.\nSo Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some minotaurs who wanted to cook and eat him.\nOnly Lump and Grit made it back to Illefarn with the earth key.\nAfter giving the key to the Red Wizards, Lump went to his room to cry for Scratchess fate.\nLump cared a lot for Scratches but he was not very smart and could easily mistake another rat for his loved one. He hated elves for their role in killing his family."
