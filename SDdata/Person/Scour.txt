'''Scour''' was a [[Voidharrow]] [[demon]] who entered [[Toril]] through a gate from another universe with his "sibling" [[Murmur]] hundreds of years before the [[Spellplague]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6628}} Scour's consciousness was scattered into many pieces{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6632}} but Murmur was apparently able to revive much of Scour's mind.

By [[1480 DR]], Scour was in [[Luskan]], manifesting as a swarm of mutated vermin. Scour infected many inhabitants with the [[Fury]] plague, which caused victims to go into a homicidal rage. Scour attacked an assembly of Luskan's gangs, killing many people.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5308}} He was confronted in Luskan's underground by [[Kalen Dren]], [[Myrin Darkdance]], and [[Sithe]] and defeated. Sithe sacrificed herself by using her innate abilities to open a portal to the void where she took the remaining fragments of Scour.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6237}}

==Appearance==
