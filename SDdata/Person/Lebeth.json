        "mainbody": "ebeth was a Daughter of the Oak Father, Silvanus. She came to Berun on the evening of Tarsakh 19, , for the ceremony of the Jalesh Rudra.\nLebeth wore a sleeveless gown down to the ankles, apparently made of many strips of fabric that was so light that it fluttered in the breeze. It seemed downy gray in the dark, but sparkled like frost under moonlight, reflecting some of the violet light of dusk back onto her far darker skin. She had hair to her waist, with flowers and even tiny sprigs twined within her tresses.\nOn the evening of Tarsakh 19, 1374 DR, she came to Berun at the foothills of the Khopet-Dag while he bathed himself in a pool. She offered him pipes so he could play for her, as he had lost his own. She also declared that his clothes were gone and no longer needed, probably having discarded those ruined garments on her own. While in her dance, she spoke portents to Berun, calling on him to restore balance to Sentinelspire.\nOn the morning afterwards, Berun found that she had replaced his garments and furnished him with new weapons."
