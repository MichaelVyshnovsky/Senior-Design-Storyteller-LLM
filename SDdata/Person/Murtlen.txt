{{quote|''Ye haven't bought anything here, have ye? Well, don't!''|Murtlen}}

==Description==
Murtlen was a fair-skinned [[human]] male with red hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Murtlen could be found shopping in Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]], in [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. He frequented shops and stalls opened on the elevated wooden walkways, including stalls run by [[Maheer yn Kadar el Saddith]] and [[Quataris]]. Murtlen ranted at passersby folk about them surely having been cheated by these merchants and accused their goods of being shoddy and of poor quality.
