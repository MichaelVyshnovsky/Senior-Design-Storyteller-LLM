        "mainbody": "'''Ohland Grethgar''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1280}} to {{yearlink|1282}}.",
        "Appearance": "He was handsome and well-spoken.",
        "Personality": "He had been described as both ambitious and ruthless, the latter trait coming after the death of his second master.",
        "Abilities": "Ohland Grethgar had devised a ''[[bone hook]]'' spell that allowed him to pursue a target wherever they fled, no matter how far they went or whether they were ''[[polymorph]]ed''. During his time with the Trapmaster, he developed magic to alter locks, and to create doors that were protected by beams of magic to stab intruders. He had gained a reputation in [[magefair]]s for the small but useful spells he developed.",
        "History": "Ohland was born in [[Westgate]] to poor parents; he spent a good portion of his childhoold amongst the logging crofts in the [[Starmantle]] area, where he met his first master, [[Iriskree]]. He performed minor tasks for both her and his family; his reputation spread, and he was soon offered an apprenticeship by a mage known only as [[the Trapmaster]]. The Trapmaster perished in a spell duel with [[Jaelaera Sundeirnyn]]; she then turned on him, and he barely lived. He resolved to become stronger then so as to meet every challenger.\n\nHe continued the Trapmaster's trade, demonstrating some spells at [[magefair]]s, and soon caught the eye of [[the Simbul]]. She saw him as a kindred spirit, and offered to turn him into one of the mightiest mages if he would slay the one mage she was forbidden from killing, the [[Magister]] [[Uldinus Lawkland]]. He agreed, growing in power dramatically under her eye. After slaying several [[Calishite]] mages of great cruelty, he set a trap for the Magister, laying a rumor of a crypt full of gorgeous [[Netherese]] sorceresses in stasis, surrounded by a hoard of items only they knew how to use. Disguising himself as one of the women, he emerged from hiding and issued a formal challenge as soon as the Magister appeared. Though the Magister fled immediately, Ohland's ''[[bone hook]]'' spell allowed him to follow precisely, and quickly slay him.\n\nDuring his tenure as the Magister, Ohland taught the rudiments of magic to people up and down the [[Sword Coast]], blasting challengers whenever they came to him. Unfortunately, he perished over [[Orlumbor]] when he was challenged by the [[black dragon]] [[Starlaurynguldar]], who was protected with some sort of antimagic amulet; though the device did not survive, Ohland died as well. The dragon perished of its wounds shortly after, and thus, the Mantle of the Magister was offered to [[Inhil Lauthdryn]].",
        "Rumors": "There were suspicions that Ohland had also been [[the Simbul]]'s lover during his time as her disciple."
