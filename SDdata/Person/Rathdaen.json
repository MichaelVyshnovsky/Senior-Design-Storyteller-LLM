        "mainbody": "'''Rathdaen''' was a skilled [[wizard]] who lived some time during the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Rathdaen traveled extensively, exploring much of [[Faer√ªn]] and aiding others with his [[magic]] when possible. Sometimes he was repaid for his kind efforts with other magic, which he collected into a tome later called the ''[[Tome of Rathdaen]]''. When it was in pristine condition the tome was believed to hold over 60 potent [[spell]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Upon his death Rathdaen passed the ''Tome'' along to his apprentice [[Narsel]]."
