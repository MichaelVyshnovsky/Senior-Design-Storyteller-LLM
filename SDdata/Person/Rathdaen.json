        "mainbody": "Rathdaen was a skilled wizard who lived some time during the 7 century DR.\nRathdaen traveled extensively, exploring much of Faer√ªn and aiding others with his magic when possible. Sometimes he was repaid for his kind efforts with other magic, which he collected into a tome later called the Tome of Rathdaen. When it was in pristine condition the tome was believed to hold over 60 potent spells.\nUpon his death Rathdaen passed the Tome along to his apprentice Narsel."
