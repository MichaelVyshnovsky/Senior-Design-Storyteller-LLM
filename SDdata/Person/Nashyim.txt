'''Nashyim of the Desolated Wood''' was a [[volodni]] [[cleric]] and [[blightlord]] of [[Talona]] from the [[Rawlinswood]] in the [[Great Dale]] operating in [[Cormanthor]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Nashyim}}

==Description==
Nashyim stood {{SI|6'3"|'"|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|170|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==History==
Born as '''Nashyim of the Glimmering Brook''' ''circa'' [[1293 DR]], he was raised a typical volodni and taught the typical degree of contempt for the warm-blooded flesh beings. All his kin thought he would become a warrior and fight to expand volodni holdings in the Rawlinswood. Yet he had an ingrained burning angerâ€”the warm bloods, his parents, authority figures, life in general, and the world as a whole were all targets of his ire. Often, he lashed out in his anger and frustration, and often, he was disciplined, and this only made him angrier.

Then the [[Rotting Man]] appeared in the Rawlinswood in the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], and spread his horrid blight there. Though the volodni were his first victims, and they were infected by the thousands and became blightspawned creatures, a few angry young volodni like Nashyim were attracted to this power and destruction, and hungered for it. By Talona's grace, Nashyim survived and was taken by the blightlords to the Rotting Man himself, and he devoted himself to the Mother of All Plagues.

Over the next decade in service to Talona, Nashyim learned self-discipline if nothing else and the Rotting Man directed his rage and retaliation at his foes. Becoming a blightlord himself, Nashyim put in charge of his former, now blightspawned kin, and felt a spiteful glee at the reversal of fortune and authority.

However, ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], Nashyim departed the Rawlinswood with a small troop of blightspawned beasts and went in search of a new woodland where he could spread Talona's blight. He considered the [[Forest of Lethyr]], but avoided it and the greater powers there. Instead, he went further afield, to Cormanthor, being curious about [[elves]] and wanting to <s>infect</s> meet with them.{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Vishara}}

==Personality==
Nashyim was eternally angry, at everyone and everything, and he hated being held back in any way, causing him to always retaliate in some way. However, over time he learned to target this impulse at his and the Rotting Man's enemies, until it became his standard practice. He was also restless and impatient, favoring direct action over delay, but he could make himself wait when he must and could act indirectly sometimes, especially when a foolish direct action would lead to defeat.

Having come to lead the infected volodni kin whom he'd once resented, Nashyim enjoyed the sense of irony and vindictiveness. It taught him a concept best described as 'what goes around comes around', reminding him that his own actions have consequences than can come back to bite him. While no less driven to act, he made sure to minimize consequences. For example, rather than kill some people and let survivors escape and potentially come back seeking justice, Nashyim was more likely simply kill everyone.

Nashyim's greatest love was creating and commanding blightspawned creatures, particularly turning a person into one and sending them to spread devastation, to both torture the victim and terrorize others, showing them none were safe from the blightlords.

==Abilities==
As a blightlord, with a touch, Nashyim could infect a living creature with [[Talona's blight]], which inevitably either killed a victim or changed them into a [[blightspawned creature]]. He was immune to [[disease]] himself and would not be attacked by blightspawned, which he could mentally control.

As was standard for blightlords, Nashyim was also a skilled wielder of the glaive and could use it to inflict [[icy burst]]s and Talona's blight.

He commanded the [[Destruction domain|Destruction]], [[Suffering domain|Suffering]], and [[Blightbringer domain]]s. Some distinct spells he used were ''[[bladebane]]'' and ''[[soul scour]]'' and he used metamagic to cast some at a distance.

==Possessions==
He wielded a ''+1 [[glaive]]'' and a masterwork [[light crossbow]] with a score of [[bolt]]s. He wore ''+3 [[bluewood]] [[chainmail]]'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +1'', and an ''[[amulet of health]] +4''. He also used [[wand]]s of ''[[cure light wounds]]'' and ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' for healing.
