Warrior '''Qen''' was a [[githyanki]] guard from [[Crèche Y'llek]], on [[Toril]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Leave me alone. The watch must remain undisturbed.''|Warrior Qen}}

==Description==
Qen was a gith with gaunt body and leathery yellow skin. He had long brown hair and he was adorned in a set of heavy githyanki [[armor]] and armed with a gith [[greatsword]].

==History==
Warrior Qen, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] of [[Lathander]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[West Faerûn]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. Qen stood guard in the Crèche's hatchery and showed stern determination to his duty.
