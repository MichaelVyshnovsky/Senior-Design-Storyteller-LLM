'''Millek the Thrush''' was a [[halfling]] in the [[Monastery of the Precipice]].

==Activities==
Millek was a thief who, in [[1479 DR]], traveled to [[Spellgard]], seeking Lady [[Saharel]]'s counsel to answer a simple question: where she could find a lost treasure?

Millek resisted the temptation of thieving from the most vulnerable seekers.
