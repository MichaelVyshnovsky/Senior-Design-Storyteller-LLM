        "mainbody": "'''Captain Zemmer''' was the leader of a mercenary company that served [[Lord Neverember]] in the city of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "She held a particularly strong hatred for [[gnoll]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Zemmer owed her [[Thay]]an heritage to her father a noted practitioner of [[necromancy]]. The two had a great falling out when Zemmer revealed to her father her devotion to [[Tempus]], the Lord of Battles. They wound up never speaking to each other again, as the senior Zemmer was eventually sucked into the [[Shadowfell]].\n\nGrowing up she had a [[zombie|zombified]] [[dog]] as a family pet.",
        "History": "While Zemmer led her company as captain, the activities of her father prevented her from ascending the ranks of the military organization.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Captain Zemmer had a number of her soldiers turn against the city, selling their services to the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. In response to their lack of loyalty, Zemmer hired some local [[adventurer]] to teach the deserters a lesson by means of violence.\n\nTo secure better contracts with the city and the [[Neverwinter Guard]], Zemmer hired that same adventurer to destroy her father's old lab in the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath]] graveyard to quell any rumors about his dark past."
