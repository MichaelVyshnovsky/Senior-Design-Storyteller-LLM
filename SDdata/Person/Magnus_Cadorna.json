        "mainbody": "agnus Cadorna was the member of the textile merchant House Cadorna who brought the family to prominence over four generations before the mid-14 century DR.\nBack when the Cadorna clan lived in obscurity, the family seamster business suffered greatly when their home and its surrounding lands became plagued by a red dragon. The familys eldest son, Magnus Cadorna, joined the local militia assembled to fight the winged wyrm, or at least to control and minimize the red menaces ransacking. Eventually, adventurers flocked to slay the dragon, and the militia waited in reserve. Unsurprisingly, the adventurers failed, but not before the dragon was wounded. Enraged, the wyrm decided to rain fire on the village that aided the adventurers. Most of the militia was slain by the dragon Magnus Cadorna was the only man standing, desperate and badly hurt. The man managed to drive the dragon back and finished the dragon off with a fatal blow.\nThe feat made Magnus Cadorna a hero of the Dragon Reach, and his family received money and accolades that elevated the Cadorna clan to a position of power. Soon enough, members of the now greatly respected Cadorna family spread across the Dragon Reach region, forming a profitable textile trading company.\nOn the fifteenth anniversary of the dragons death, the comparative Cadorna family sword was forged and presented to Magnus, now an eighty-two years old man. He was thankful but considered the gesture to be silly. The blade would remain with the Cadorna family, passed from father to son for four generations until it eventually left the \"dragon killer\" familys possession."
