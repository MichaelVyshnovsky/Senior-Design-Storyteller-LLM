'''Eltargrim Irithyl''' was sixth [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]], seventh son of Coronal [[Tannivh Irithyl]], ruling from {{Yearlink|-223}} to his death in [[661 DR]]. He was of the unpopular opinion that the outside races (such as [[human]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[halfling]]s and [[dwarves]]) could not be held back by the elves due to their sheer numbers, so he allowed them entry to the forest of [[Cormanthor]] and to inhabit the city of Cormanthor, renaming it [[Myth Drannor]] in [[261 DR]].

==Description==
Eltargrim was a gold elf, with golden eyes and long silvery white hair. He possessed a warrior's build until his death, though he was often seen in robes of state rather than armour after becoming Coronal. He wore his tattoos of military rank until his death: a black sword on one hand and two crossed rings on the other.

==History==
Eltargrim was born in {{Yearlink|-612}} in the community of [[Semberholme]]. In his early years he joined the [[Akh'Velahr]], the standing army of Cormanthyr, remaining there for over three centuries and attaining the rank of [[Akh'Velahr|penaal]].

===Eltargrim's Rysar===
Eltargrim rose to Coronal in {{Yearlink|-223}}

The Coronal began noticing the ever-encroaching humans on all of his borders. [[Cormyr]], once an elven territory, was now a human kingdom. The [[Stonelands]] had fallen to goblinkind because the Akh'Velahr would not ally with Cormyr's [[Purple Dragons]]. Lastly, the men of the [[Dalelands]] were settling the lands on all sides of Cormanthyr, and showed no sign of departing soon. Eltargrim made the first of many controversial decisions; he signed the Dales Compact and made an allegiance with the humans, raising the [[Standing Stone]] with [[Elven High Magic]], marking the beginning of the [[Dale Reckoning]]. While this led to considerable peace for over two centuries, the Coronal was not satisfied.

Eltargrim pondered Oacenth's vow to "unify the tribes of this great land" and how a four-thousand year old vow might apply to modern times. After much deliberation, the Coronal concluded that it must in fact include the N'Tel'Quess (non-elves) in the unification. Despite increasing opposition from more conservative noble houses in [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]], Eltargrim decided to open the forest realm to human [[wizard]]s and [[druid]]s as well as nonhuman but nonelven settlers in the year [[220 DR]]. The unification grew to a peak in [[261 DR]], when despite attempts on his life and rebellion in his court, Eltargrim raised the [[mythal]] of Cormanthor, renaming it [[Myth Drannor]], and commencing the [[History of Myth Drannor|Opening]], inviting all races to live under the city's towers in peace and unity.

===Death===
Eltargrim died in [[661 DR]]. Having seen his dreams of unification and peace under the towers of Myth Drannor come to a head, he felt rested and complete, and decided to pass on to [[Arvandor]] willfully. During the [[Midsummer]] celebrations, he woke in the morning to greet the dawn dressed in his ceremonial armour. He took up a song and raised his [[Elfblade]] to the sun as its rays touched his face, and with a smile climbed into the heavens and ascended from life. He left the magical sword afloat to be claimed by his chosen heir [[Aravae Irithyl]], his grand-niece (though she never did so). Eltargrim was the last Coronal to rule over Cormanthyr for centuries. Eltargrim's death marked the death knell to the empire, initiating a period called the Dusk. Cormanthyr collapsed very soon afterwards.
