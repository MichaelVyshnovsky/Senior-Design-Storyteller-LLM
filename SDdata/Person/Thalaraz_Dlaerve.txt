'''Thalaraz Dlaerve''' was a [[warrior]] that lived in [[Waterdeep]]. He was tortured for information and then killed by the notorious crime lord [[Elaith Craulnober]] in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}.

==Activities==
Thalaraz was a warrior and [[adventurer]], and sometimes took work as a caravan guard.

==Possessions==
In his last days, he was in Waterdeep in possession of bags of [[ruby|rubies]].

==History==
Originally from [[Sheirtalar]], his work and wanderings brought him to Waterdeep where he stayed for many years. At the time of his disappearance in 1344 DR, he was inebriated and telling tales of adventure in a forgotten [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom deep below the [[Raurin]] region and taking a ''[[portal]]'' that brought him to the [[House of Stone]], not far from home. News of his supposed exploits reached the ears of Elaith Craulnober, who was gathering information about possible treasure hoards in his search for wealth and [[moonblade]]s in any stage of creation. The heartless crime boss kidnapped Thalaraz, tortured him with some form of ''[[mind ream]]'' spell to learn what he knew of the House of Stone and the other dwarven kingdom, and then killed him.
