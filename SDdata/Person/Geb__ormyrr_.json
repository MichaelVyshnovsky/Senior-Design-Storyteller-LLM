        "mainbody": "'''Geb''' was an [[ormyrr]] of the [[Sharpstick clan]] who resided in the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].\n{{quote|''Hulu, your weapons, put them down! I not seek harm, no harm for you.''|Geb, the lost ormyrr}}",
        "Personality": "Geb was a peaceful ormyrr, even though he could protect himself. His speech patterns in [[Common]] were sprinkled with words and concepts of some other language, presumably the mysterious language of his people. These words included: \"hulu\", \"grebbo\", and \"hoi\".",
        "Possessions": "Geb was in possession of a ''wand of cone of cold'' (a variety of ''[[wand of frost]]''), that appeared to be an non-melting magically enchanted icicle.",
        "Relationship": "Geb was a part of the Sharpstick clan, which made a home in the [[Deep Halls]] of the Dwarven Dungeons. Geb was friends with [[Retha]], a trader ormyrr of the same clan. The Sharpstick clan was conflicting with a group of [[orcs]] over territory; the conflict was resolved with the help of the heroes from Phlan.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], Geb, being obsessed with [[magic item]]s like so many of his people, went on a search for one particular piece of enchantment and eventually got lost in the expansive complex that was the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]' Main Halls. Eventually, the ormyrr was rescued by the group of heroes from [[Phlan]] that came to oppose the [[Cult of the Dragon]] what was corrupting the ruined city's ''[[mythal]]''. Thankful for the heroes not attacking the alien-looking creature, Geb gifted them with his ''wand of cone of cold'', before heading out back to the [[Deep Halls]] where his clan resided."
