        "mainbody": "'''Laeral Silverhand''' ({{Pronounce|LAIR|awl|refs=}}), born '''Anamanué Silverhand''' and formerly known as the Witch-Queen of the North and later the Lady Mage of Waterdeep, was one of the [[Seven Sisters]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], and the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Together with her partner [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]], they led the [[Moonstars]], a dissident faction of the [[Harpers]], which sought to guide the cities and countries of the [[North]] toward a shared destiny.",
        "Personality": "Laeral was incredibly organized—it was the only way she could manage to fit all of her activities into a single day. She was friendly and accommodating, leading almost everyone who met her, even the haughty nobles of Waterdeep, to consider her a true friend. She was also proactive in her defense of the city, to the extent that certain Waterdhavians would stage calamitous events so that she would keep tabs on persons of interest for them without their needing to ask for her help or involve themselves directly.\n\nHaving been in thrall to the ''Crown of Horns'' and forced to commit heinous acts by it, she felt that she understood the nature of evil better than most and often mediated disputes with rogues, undesirables, and sentient monsters, especially in [[Skullport]] where she kept an alias identity in the form of [[Irusyl Eraneth]].{{fact}}\n\nLaeral was infuriated by magic-users who employed their power to deceive and exert baleful influence over others. She disliked [[doppelganger]]s and slave-owners.{{fact}}\n\nLaeral was especially conscious of personal security and always kept several daggers hidden on her person.{{fact}}",
        "Abilities": "One of the most prolific [[magic item]] creators in recorded history, Laeral was particularly adept at determining the abilities of magic items and could potentially do so merely by holding one in her hand without activating it. She also hid a gift granted to her by [[Mystra]] to deactivate or cause malfunctions in magical items that touched her.\n\nAs a centuries-old wizard, Laeral was one of the most accomplished spellcasters in [[Faerûn]], though her powers steadily declined as she had to increasingly devote her energies to maintaining her aging body. Like all Chosen, Laeral's divine blessings were much reduced in the wake of the [[Second Sundering]], as all gods took a more distant approach to interfering in mortal affairs. Nonetheless, her knowledge and facility with [[Weave]]-craft, as well as her [[silver fire]], made her a formidable opponent.",
        "Possessions": "When Laeral became a Chosen, Mystra gifted Laeral with special power over magic items. As such, Laeral created many magic items in her lifetime. Notable and oft-copied examples include a magic steel [[shield]] that granted the wielder resistance to spell, and shields of this type were subsequently named ''[[Laeral's spell shield]]s''. In addition to the normal abilities of a Chosen of Mystra, Laeral had given herself the permanent benefit of wearing a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''. Although there is a type of magic armor called ''[[Laeral's storm armor]]'', it is not clear what role Laeral had in its development.<ref> Laeral ceased her prolific creation of magical items after she was freed from the ''Crown of Horns''.{{fact}}\n\nLaeral collected beautiful dresses and shoes. She liked to wear them to social occasions but didn't care if they were soiled or ruined while she wore them. Laeral also particularly valued hand-sized ornaments depicting frogs, snails, and toads. The pride of her collection was a set of jewels carved into the shape of snails and frogs that magically orbited her bedside table.\n\nDuring her reign as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she wore a ''[[robe of the archmagi]]''.",
        "Activities": {
            "Goals": "Apart from attending to her duties, Laeral held as her objectives the addition of [[Cormyr]], [[Amn]], [[Westgate]], and [[Luskan]] to the Lords' Alliance. She also made efforts to remove [[Zhentarim]] influence from the [[Sword Coast]] and the North. Her ultimate goal however, was to unite all thinking races, be they [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[human]]s, or [[orc]]s in a goodly purpose.{{fact}}",
            "Bibliography": "Laeral wrote ''[[Lifelong with Regrets]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1391}}."
        },
        "Relationships": "Laeral was one of seven female spellcasters born to the [[ranger]] [[Dornal Silverhand]] and his wife [[Elué]] (with the exception of [[Qilué Veladorn]] who, due to divine intervention, was [[drow]]). Collectively, they were known as the [[Seven Sisters]].{{fact}}\n\nLaeral was a tremendous influence on her partner and fellow chosen of Mystra [[Khelben Arunsun]]. She was able to recognize in him those small moments of personal growth where he kept his anger and his contempt of incompetence in check.\n\nShe had three children, a girl named [[Maura Silverhand|Maura of Evermeet]], conceived by Laeral during her time under the influence of the ''Crown of Horns'' by an unknown father. Maura was in love with the Crown Prince of [[Evermeet]], [[Lamruil Moonflower|Lamruil]].{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Lore Look: Laeral Silverhand}} Laeral also had twins, a boy named [[Krehlan Arunsun]] and a girl named [[Kamaulra (Laerel's daughter)|Kamaulra]]<ref name=EGP/> fathered by her consort Chosen Khelben shortly before his death in [[1374 DR]].\n\nDuring her tenure as Open Lord, Laeral had a challenging relationship with [[Vajra Safahr]], the young and rather insecure 7{{th}} [[Blackstaff]].",
        "History": {
            "Early Years": "[[File:Laeral Silverhand Arunsun.png|thumb|''Regal Laeral Silverhand Arunsun, the Open Lord of Waterdeep.''|459x459px]]\nLaeral was born in the {{YearlinkName|765}}, fifth of the seven daughters of the godess Mystra. After their mother died, Laeral, [[Dove Falconhand|Dove]], and [[Storm Silverhand|Storm]] were placed into the care of [[Elminster]] until they came of age. When her sisters left the Old Sage, Laeral elected to stay with him as his apprentice. When she had finished her studies, she left to join the [[Harpers]].<ref>\n\nLaeral left the Harpers early and, in the {{YearlinkName|806}}, at age 41, she was a self-styled queen, ruling the realm of [[Stornanter]] from [[Port Llast]]. Many later sages believed that Laeral had named herself after this queen, not realizing that it was actually her. It was at this time that Laeral also attempted to rebuild and resettle the ruins of [[Illusk]]. Before she did so, she explored the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], where she encountered several [[lich]]es who were members of the [[Grand Cabal]], rulers over Illusk from centuries before. She sealed the liches inside the tower with magic before continuing with her other works.\n\nBarely ten years into her reign, Laeral's court mage, [[Khelben Arunsun|Malek Aldhanek]], with whom she had worked very closely, was apparently assassinated in a plot involving other nobles. Realizing too late that she was in love with Malek, Laeral quit her court and spent twenty five years wandering Stornanter. In truth, Malek was not dead—he'd never even existed—and was actually Khelben Arunsun in disguise. Khelben faked his death to deal with a dire prophecy he had discovered in the works of [[Alaundo]].\n\nDuring this period of wandering, Laeral came into conflict with [[Slarkrethel]] in the {{YearlinkName|834}} and although the great [[kraken]] was driven off, he managed to steal Laeral's [[Soaring Throne of the Witch-Queen|magical throne]], which she had crafted with Malek.{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|75}}\n\nHer activities attracted the attention of her sister [[Syluné Silverhand|Syluné]], who desired to rule over the same region, and the two were drawn (some say manipulated) into spell-battle in the {{YearlinkName|841}}. Having grown up separately, neither recognized the other so, before they destroyed each other, [[Mystra]] felt obliged to manifest herself before the two sisters and explain their heritage, offering them both the mantle of Chosen. They accepted and journeyed together for a time, under the guidance of [[Azuth]].",
            "Adventuring Years": "Under an assumed name, Laeral eventually established herself as a hard-drinking and fearless adventurer, coming to lead an adventuring band known as [[the Nine]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1337}}, Laeral and the Nine discovered the ancient [[Netherese]] [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' in [[Yûlash]]. The ''Crown'' was actually planted for her to find by the Netherese [[lich]] [[Aumvor The Undying]], who wished to use the ''Crown'' to influence her to marry him. The plot failed when Laeral donned the headpiece and the ''Crown's'' powers conflicted with Laeral's [[spellfire]] and drove her into madness.\n\nTwenty years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Khelben Arunsun traveled to the [[Stronghold of the Nine]]  in the [[High Forest]], freed Laerel Silverhand from the ''Crown of Horns'', the malign intelligence contained within' and her madness. Laeral returned with him to Waterdeep for more healing, and after that, they were inseparable. She was referred to as Lady Arunsun,<ref> though they were never married. The mysterious circumstances surrounding Laeral and Khelben's meeting and subsequent partnership led some to believe that Laeral was enslaved to Khelben against her will. Laeral never denied this, instead preferring to let those who wished Khelben harm seek her out as an ally against him.\n\nLaerel soon came to be the caretaker of Blackstaff Tower and Blackstaff Academy, which was founded as apprentices flocked to the Tower to learn from Khelben and herself.",
            "Return of the Archwizards": "Laeral played an important role in the series of events known as the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]]. In [[Nightal 24]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Lord [[Gervas Imesfor]] appeared before Blackstaff Tower and informed Laeral, Khelben, and Elminster about the threat of the returned [[phaerimm]] from beyond the [[Sharn Wall]]. During the early skirmishes of the growing conflict, she led a small force against the phaerimm at the [[Battle of Rocnest]] and was forced to retreat to the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].\n\nIn the early months of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Laeral and her sister Storm led Waterdhavian forces to Evereska in relief of beleaguered [[Evereska]]. The sisters' forces were ambushed by the phaerimm's army of thralls, but were themselves rescued by the [[blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] [[Malygris]] and his minions, allies of the returned [[Princes of Shade|princes]] of [[Thultanthar]]. Laeral's forces arrived at Evereska not long after the Princes of Shade withdrew from the emerging alliance of the [[Heartlands]]. While Laeral was fortunate enough to reunite with her love Khelben—after being seperated from him for months since Lord Imesfor appeared at Blackstaff Tower—the army was devastated by a secret phaerimm assault and Laeral herself received a grievous injury in the form of a dismembered arm. \n\nNot one to be stopped, Laeral joined her lover Khelben, along with sisters Storm, Dove, and Alustriel in a daring mission against Princes of Shade, who collectively posed a threat to the Realms as great as that of the phaerimm.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a new shadowy organization came to Laeral's attention. This new thieves' guild that called itself [[Shadowhands (guild)|Shadowhands]], was led by a man only known as the \"Shadowed Man.\" It secretly was a [[Tiamat]]-worshiping [[shadow dragon]] that somehow found a way into Waterdeep and staged an attack on the [[Embassy of Ravens Bluff (Waterdeep)|Embassy of Ravens Bluff]]. Under the guise of an ancient beggar woman named Gelda, Laeral spent three days staking the shadows moving in the night around the [[House of Gems]]. Under the same guise, she met a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff who found themselves opposing the shadow dragon. Laeral informed the adventurers of the organization's activities and set them on a path that eventually ended the life of [[Whisper (shadow dragon)|Whisper]], a shadow dragon prince.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|15-16}}\n\nWhen Khelben died in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Laeral returned from life in the public eye for some time.",
            "15{{th}} Century": "In the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, [[Larloch]] foiled Laeral and Alustriel's plans and absorbed the wards of Candlekeep. Shortly thereafter, Laeral, Alustriel, Elminster, and the [[Srinshee]] prevented Larloch's ascension to godhood. Laeral remained a Chosen of the restored Mystra.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], Mystra herself appeared to Laeral. With the end of [[Luruar]], stability was once again needed in the [[Sword Coast North|northern Sword Coast]], and Mystra tasked Laeral with maintaining it by becoming Open Lord of Waterdeep. According to Mystra, her presence would actually restrain abuse of magic for personal gain, and therefore limit the possibility that the general population could turn against wizards, blaming them for eventual disasters, and blindly hunting all [[arcane magic|Art]]-wielders. Following Mystra's request, Laeral returned to Waterdeep, and swiftly managed to gain the support of the Masked Lords of the city, supplanting [[Dagult Neverember]] as Open Lord{{Page needed}} ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1489}}.{{LaeralOpenLord}}\n\nShe served as the representative of her home city during the [[Second Council of Waterdeep]], when the reborn the [[Cult of the Dragon]] threatened much of the [[Western Heartlands]] and Sword Coast North.\n\nAt some point during her Lordship, ''circa'' 1490s DR, Laeral Silverhand acquired a baby [[griffin]] and hired a [[Traynov]], a trainer to raise the monster and train as a companion and loyal creature. Both baby griffin and its trainer were staying inside Laeral's mansion in Waterdeep. Unfortunately for the Open Lord, Traynov was bribed by the current [[Xanathar]] during that time, [[Zushaxx]], and the monster trainer aided in the griffon's kidnapping. Laeral Silverhand and her trusted [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] civilar [[Jauslo]] found a [[halfling]] thief not associated with the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] and recruited him in the dangerous rescue mission to [[Skullport]]."
