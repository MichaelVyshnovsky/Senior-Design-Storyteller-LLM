'''Surgath Ilder''' was a prospector of the [[Western Heartlands]] in the early mid-3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a bearded and weatherbeaten man. On the night of his death, he was wearing tattered clothing, boots, and wielding a stout, worn sword.

==Personality==
Surgath was greedy and somewhat boisterous.

==Possessions==
Amongst other possessions, he had a ''[[wardstone]]'' with fire-based defenses, and a ''[[wyrmtongue scepter]]''. He later sold the scepter to [[Elminster]].

==Activities==
He claimed to have ransacked a number of [[elven]] tombs.

==Relationships==
He appeared to have a rivalry with [[Karlmuth Hauntokh]].

==History==
Two summers prior to {{yearlink|241}}, Surgath had traded two rubies for his ''wardstone''. On that year, he discussed at length his activities one night while in the [[Herald's Horn]] inn; there, he mentioned having acquired a scepter roughly a tenday prior to the date. He sold that scepter on the same night to a young Elminster for a hundred [[rubies]], but died later when attacked by [[Heldebran]].
