Surgath Ilder was a prospector of the Western Heartlands in the early mid-3 century DR.
He was a bearded and weatherbeaten man. On the night of his death, he was wearing tattered clothing, boots, and wielding a stout, worn sword.
Surgath was greedy and somewhat boisterous.
Amongst other possessions, he had a wardstone with fire-based defenses, and a wyrmtongue scepter. He later sold the scepter to Elminster.
He claimed to have ransacked a number of elven tombs.
He appeared to have a rivalry with Karlmuth Hauntokh.
Two summers prior to , Surgath had traded two rubies for his wardstone. On that year, he discussed at length his activities one night while in the Heralds Horn inn there, he mentioned having acquired a scepter roughly a tenday prior to the date. He sold that scepter on the same night to a young Elminster for a hundred rubies, but died later when attacked by Heldebran.
