Gareth Dragonsbane rose to power in 1359 DR, with no other kings of Damara known to be such paladins of Ilmater. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the events of Silverfish occur during the 1360s DR. slain by barghest",

        "mainbody": "Iref Marsk was a guard in Heliogabalus as of the late mid-14 century DR.\nHe was stocky. His hair was \"foppishly\" barbered, slicked with oil.\nAs of the time of his death, hed bought an amethyst and gold earring.\nIref Marsk was part of the raid on Kosef Demsks room the morning he was captured at some point in the 1360s DR.\nNights later, while leaving a brothel, he was followed by Pavel Shemov and Tana Farag, who suspected he had worked to frame Kosef though he noticed them, they caught up to him. but before they could, he was slain by a barghest.\nThough they never actually managed to prove it, Pavel Shemov and Tana Farag had reason to believe that Iref Marsk had employed some device as he entered Kosefs home to dissolve a duplicate of Kosefs signature weapon which had been swapped for the real thing."
