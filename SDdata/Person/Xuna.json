        "mainbody": "'''Xuna''' was a [[rogue]] living in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Xuna was one of the survivors of the first attack of the [[Thay]]an forces on Neverwinter during the [[Shadovarâ€“Thay War]]. Her parents were killed during that battle, her mother by a [[dracolich]], and her father by a powerful [[undead]] warrior.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Xuna took part in [[the Siege of Neverwinter]]. She fought against the same undead warrior that killed her father, and although she had the upper hand at first, eventually she was overpowered. She was rescued from certain death by the [[cleric]] [[Celeste]]. Xuna later joined forces with Celeste and Sergeant [[Knox]] to defeat the undead before meeting Valindra's army at the head of a force of Neverwinter's defenders.\n\nLater, Xuna accompanied [[Elminster]] and the factions of the North to the [[Dragonbone Vale]], where the allied forces sought to thwart a plot by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. There, Xuna was put in charge of supply lines for the [[Shield of the North]] encampment.<ref>"
