In the , Sir Llewellyn hired a group of adventurers to lead the Daggerford army against the Hordes of Dragonspear. He was shot and killed by a trio of Barbazu sent by the Cornugon Vrag to assassinate Daggerfords military leader. While clerical intervention was possible to save his life, the specially-prepared arrow had damaged his life force as well as his body, leaving him comatose for some time and unable to participate in the Second Dragonspear War.
His home in Daggerford was located along the northern stretch of Wall Street near Delfens Tower.
