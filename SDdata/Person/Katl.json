When the survivors arrived in Ulatos and discovered that the place was under the control of Don Vaez, an old rival of Cordell, Katl tried to kill Don using his eagle form but was defeated and severely injured.\nPut in prison with all the officers of the Golden Legion, he was near death but Cordell offered Don Vaez all his gold in order to have a cleric save him."
