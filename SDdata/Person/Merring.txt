'''Brother Merring''' was a villager of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] around [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Originally from Neverwinter, Merring came to the village of West Harbor. He preached about [[Lathander]]'s teachings (thinking it would unite the villagers), but the villagers worshiped [[Chauntea]]. He healed the fighters in the Harvest Brawl, and later the warriors who stood in the defense of West Harbor during the battle against [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] in 1374 DR.
