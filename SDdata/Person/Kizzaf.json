        "Description": "Kizzaf bore a magical tattoo on her body She also wore a ''[[cloak of resistance]]''.\n\nKizzaf, like many [[Thay]]ans, was bald, but when hunting for slaves, she wore a dark, long-haired wig.",

        "Activities": "Kizzaf spent most of the day's hours in the compound's main barracks scribing spells with other wizards and brewing potions, including [[potion of love|''potions of love'']].",
        "History": "Beginning at about the start of summer, [[1372 DR]], Kizzaf was secretly using ''[[charm person]]'' spells and ''potions of love'' to charm various townsfolk with the intent to sell them into slavery. Her actions triggered the investigation of a group of adventurers, who learned of the nefarious plans when two young men, named [[Talf]] and [[Elonn]], never returned to their homes one night around [[Midsummer]]. The men had been seen at a tavern speaking to a tall woman with long, dark hair. They were later seen by a drunk leaving the town with the mysterious woman.\n\nKizzaf sold Talf and Elonn to a Thayan merchant named [[Mahzed]]. The adventurers then tracked her to the Red Wizard compound. There, the adventures battled Kizzaf and two [[zombie]]s that she had created with an ''[[animate dead]]'' scroll. (She had acquired this scroll previously while aiding the local militia and had buried the zombies within the compound gates to later call upon for help.) The compound's leader, Hinnar, wanting to maintain peaceful relations with the nearby town, tried to aid the adventurers and capture Kizzaf alive. History does not record their fates."
