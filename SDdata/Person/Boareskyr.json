        "History": "The first temporary crossing that later became the Boareskyr Bridge was constructed by the hero to cross the river with an army and attack the [[Bloody Tusks]] [[orc]] tribe destroying them as a result.\n\nIn [[1371 DR]]{{DDTS}}, the Boareskyr Bridge was under the control of the Boareskyr family, namely, dimwitted [[Becil Boareskyr|Becil]] and [[Bullard Boareskyr]]. Another descendant of the hero's was [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]] who was to wed [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]]."
