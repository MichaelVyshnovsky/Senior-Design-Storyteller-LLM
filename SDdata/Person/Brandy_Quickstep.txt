Brandy Quickstep was a halfling resident of Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
Brandy had a number of connections in her home city, including Tarley Bluebell, who spent her time in Protectors Enclave, as well as a number of Neverwintan merchants.
After the Siege of Neverwinter in the , Brandy and her associate Tarley tried to create an enclave to house a number of their fellow halflings. Brandy traveled to the citys Blacklake District and hired adventurers to scout out three houses—Brimbleton Place, Thatcher Road, and Chadwick Stoop—believing them to for sale. They were in fact ruins and overwhelmed with the sludge that arose from the Blacklake itself.
After that unfortunate revelation, Brandy thought to make an effort to help some of her merchant friends. She turned to some adventurers, asking them to recover some of the residents personal effects that had been stolen by members of the Nashers, the violent faction of the revolutionary Sons of Alagondar, in order for her to return them to their rightful owners.
