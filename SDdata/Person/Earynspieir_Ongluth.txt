Earynspieir Ongluth was a male elf of Cormanthyr and the Royal Archmage at the time that Elminster Aumar was nominated Armathor in 241 DR.
Earynspieir was one of the two Supreme Court Wizards in service to Coronal Eltargrim. The Srinshee considered him the most likely to oppose the Opening, but it was his colleague Ilimitar who attacked the Srinshee. Earynspieir, despite all his doubts and prejudices, ultimately helped to raise the mythal in 261 DR.
