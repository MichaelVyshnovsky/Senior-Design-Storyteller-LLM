'''Earynspieir Ongluth''' was a male [[elf]] of [[Cormanthyr]] and the Royal [[Archmage]] at the time that [[Elminster Aumar]] was nominated [[Armathor]] in [[241 DR]].

==History==
Earynspieir was one of the two Supreme Court Wizards in service to [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]]. The [[Srinshee]] considered him the most likely to oppose the [[Opening]], but it was his colleague [[Ilimitar]] who attacked the Srinshee. Earynspieir, despite all his doubts and prejudices, ultimately helped to raise the ''[[mythal]]'' in [[261 DR]].
