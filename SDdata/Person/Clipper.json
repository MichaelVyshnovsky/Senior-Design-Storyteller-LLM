        "mainbody": "'''Clipper''' was a [[harengon]] who hailed from the [[Feywild]]. He was cursed to travel far and wide, and never allowed to settle down to a place he could call home.{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Annual 2022}}\n\n{{Quote|Look, this is all very fascinating, Mr. Not-a-rabbit from the Feywild, but I'm not here to go on an adventure with you.|Billi Sharpe, to Clipper.}}",
        "Description": "He resembled a large humanoid [[rabbit]], an appearance he often had to refute to people unfamiliar with the harengon folk.",
        "Personality": "[[File:Clipper,_closeup.png|thumb|right|300px|''Despite his curse, Clipper had an indomitable spirit.'']]\nClipper had an \"act first, ask questions later\" attitude and would readily throw himself into harm's way. He proved rather capable however, and got himself out of several precarious situations.\n\nHe was loyal to those that helped him, and would not leave them behind to fend for themselves.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|A curse ain't somethin' you feel. It's a missin' piece...somethin' that's been taken away from you.|Clipper, upon his first encounter with Billi Sharpe.}}\n\nAccording to Clipper, he had a \"nose for enchantment\", and could sense things like [[curse]]s and presumably magical [[dweomer]]s.{{Speculation}}",
        "Possessions": "As an adventurer, he wielded a pair of [[handaxe]]s.",
        "Activities": "Due to his curse, Clipper spent nearly all of his time traveling from one realm to another, unable to settle down at a single locale.",
        "History": "[[File:Billi, Clipper in Thither.png|thumb|right|350px|''Clipper and Billi falling into the Fey realm of Thither.'']]\n{{Quote|Thither I call, Thither I be. Wander yonder, set us free!|Clipper, saying the magic words that allowed for passageway to the realm of Thither.}}\n\nFor a time, Clipper followed the [[Witchlight Carnival]] to the far-off world of [[Toril]], where it stopped at the small town of [[Daggerford]]. There the intrepid harengon saw his opportunity to steal \"magic words\" from  the carriage of the carnival's proprietor, [[Mister Witch]]. He soon met a woman named [[Billi Sharpe|Billi]], who he sensed had also been afflicted with a \"[[fey]]-born\" curse. Clipper took Billi to the hall of mirrors, spoke the magic words, and transported himself and Billi to [[Thither]], a realm in the [[demiplane]] of [[Prismeer]].\n\nClipper and Billi got into trouble almost immediately after entering into Thither. The pair stole an [[owlbear]]-led chariot from an [[elf]] man, and rammed it into [[Honeyhollow Fortress]], an outpost for a community of [[sprite]]s. They were then taken captive by the tiny, militaristic fey and forced to make a bargain: in exchange for their freedom, Clipper and Billi would break into the lair of the [[hag]] Granny [[Skabatha Nightshade]], and steal valuable [[spell component]]s for the sprites. This was a fortunate turn of events for Clipper's companion. It had just become apparent to Billi that Granny Nightshade was the monster responsible for abducting her brother [[Desmond]] some eight years prior.\n\nThe two broke into Granny Nightshade's lair and, with the help of the hag's apprentice [[Mishka]], overcame her fey minions. During the fracas, Clipper got into a battle with [[green dragon]] wyrmling, before meeting the hag herself. Granny Nightshade offered to free Clipper from his curse, provided he join her forces. Clipper refused and stayed true to his new friend. Fortunately for the due, Billi drew up the answer to Granny Nightshade's riddle, and freed her brother from the hag's clutches. Clipper, Billi, and Desmond were instantaneously banished from the Feywild and sent back to the world of Toril.\n\nNot content to merely live their lives as before their encounter with Granny Nightshade, Clipper and Billi decided they would return to Prismeer, and free Mishka and other children like Desmond who had been taken captive by the malevolent hag."
