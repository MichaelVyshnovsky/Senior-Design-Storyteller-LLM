Aric Cozar was the transmuter mage son of Prince Frun of Bral in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Aric protected himself with a cloak of protection and a ring of protection, as well as a ring of spell turning. The prince was armed with a staff of power and often carried a potion of water breathing.
Prince Aric was the rightful heir of Brals throne, but his uncle, Prince Andru took the throne for himself and disinherited Aric Cozar. In turn, Aric planned to reclaim what was his birthright.
