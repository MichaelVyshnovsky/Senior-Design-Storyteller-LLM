{{quote|''You would insult me by presuming my intelligence and [[scrying]] skills are less than the pitiful powers of those you work for? Your superiors will hear of this.''|Sa'Sani}}

==Description==
Sa'Sani had sharp facial features and an alluring appearance. Despite it and her haughty attitude, she had a serious demeanor and steeled determination, and she expected results from her employees and associates.

==Abilities==
Apart from being a talented merchant, Sa'Sani was a capable [[wizard]].

==History==
Before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, yuan-ti followers of Sseth were tasked with infiltrating mercantile organizations of the [[Sword Coast]] in order to fill the void in trade left by the [[Shadow War]] and spread the snake god's influence and become the shadow rulers of the region. Sa'Sani helmed the [[Mercantile House]], the most successful trading company in [[Samarach]], diligently spreading the influence of her house into the Sword Coast through her associates in the [[Crossroad Keep]].

In 1374 DR, House [[Se'Sehen]] betrayed Sseth and House Sauringar by pledging their allegiance to the interloper deity [[Zehir]]. The yuan-ti of House Se'Sehen started attacking the Sauringar, slaughtering many and taking control of the [[Temple of World Serpent]]. And unbeknownst to Sa'Sani, her loyal business associates started sabotaging the Mercantile House. A group of adventurers, along with Sa'Sani's business associate, famed [[Volothamp Geddarm]], sailed from the Sword Coast to Samarach aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]''. [[Luaire Farwander]], a merchant under the employ of Sa'Sani, secretly a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] of Zehir, was onboard the ship and successfully caused its wreck through sabotage. Suspicious of the ship's destruction, Sa'Sani hired the adventurers for their own protection from the xenophobic Samarachans and to pursue her won goals. She sent the heroes to investigate the shipwreck under the false pretense of insurance investigation. Eventually, the investigation led to Luaire's exposure and death.

When the news of Luaire Farwander being a dreaded yuan-ti reached the Elite Guard of [[Samargol]], Sa'Sani claimed that even association with the scaled menace was dangerous for her business. Captain [[Dajos]] promptly informed Sa'Sani that due to her association with the [[snake-folk]], she was to leave Samargol by the following day's sunset and not return while the yuan-ti menace was investigated. Her authority was withdrawn by the Council, and the Mercantile House's control – was given to [[Osi Tchaluka]]. Sa'Sani used her contacts with the [[gnome]]s who ran the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' to flee to the Crossroad Keep on the Sword Coast, away from Samargol's laws. There, with the help of the adventurers, Sa'Sani continued growing her mercantile empire and continued investigation into strange disappearances of her allies, and numerous sabotages of trade along the Sword Coast. As a talented merchant, Sa'Sani knew that profiteering off of Neverwinter's crumbling economy after the Shadow War would only damage the economic balance of the region. Instead, she sought to boost the trade to reach her long-term goals, including restoring her good standing with Samarach via bribes.

Her first order was for the adventurers to establish contact and partnership with one of the most prominent merchant operations at the time – the [[Circle of Friends]], the [[Forgotten Lords]], or the [[Fated Winds]] of Neverwinter's [[Temple of Waukeen (Neverwinter)|Temple of Waukeen]]. All three groups worked with Sa'Sani's business associates whose operations she took over in Crossroads Keep. The adventurers were to find information on the associates' disappearance, eventually leading them to uncover the [[Snaketongue cult]]'s conspiracy. Subsequently, Sa'Sani manipulated them into attacking and destroying House Se'Sehen, which was behind the Snaketongue cultists' attempt to take over the Sword Coast's commerce.

Under Sa'Sani's leadership, her Mercantile House established trading posts in settlements near Crossroads Keep, including [[Highcliff]], [[Thundertree]], [[Phandalin]], [[Leilon]], and [[Neverwinter]].
