'''Grumthrox the Relentless''' was a [[fire giant]] of [[Mount Hotenow]] that joined the [[cult of Maegera]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Around the time when the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] launched an assault against [[Gommoth]] in [[Fireguard Fortress]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Grumthrox and the [[fire archon]] [[Immolus]] captured [[Firecross Bridge]]. The fire-worshiping duo isolated the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Hillborn|Hillborn]] expedition from the rest of their kin on the outer slopes of the mountain.{{Cite web/Neverwinter Developer Blog/CTA: Battle for the Bridge}}

Grumthrox was defeated by the heroes that same year, and the Firecross bridge was reclaimed by the dwarven expedition.
