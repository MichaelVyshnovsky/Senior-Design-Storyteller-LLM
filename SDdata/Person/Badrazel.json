        "Description": "He stood roughly 12 ft (3.6 m) tall and sported enormous clawed hands and wings. Badrazel's skin was a deep red and dancing flames wrapped around him.",
        "Personality": "Badrazel was especially hot-tempered and was known to engage almost any foe he came across, only backing off if he was sorely wounded.",
        "Abilities": "A powerful [[tanar'ri]], Badrazel possessed the full faculties of other balors of his kind. Notably, he preferred to engage foes on the wing and would enter combat with his ''[[unholy aura]]'' active. In battle, he relied on his [[whip]] or ''[[greater dispel]]ling'' power to disable most foes. Badrazel would unleash his more potent powers of ''[[implosion]]'' and ''[[unholy blight]]'' against enemies that resisted him. If all else failed, however, Badrazel could ''[[gate|summon]]'' more [[demon]]s to his side.",
        "Possessions": "Like others of his kind, Badrazel carried a flaming whip and a [[magic]]al [[longsword]].",
        "Relationships": "Badrazel has a working relationship with Kurgoth Hellspawn but preferred to operate alone rather than with the rest of Kurgoth's forces. He tended to operate more as Hellspawn's personal \"fixer\" and second-in-command.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]], the [[half-fiend]] [[fire giant]] Kurgoth Hellspawn invaded [[Maerimydra]] with the balor Badrazel at his side. While Kurgoth made the [[Coliseum (Maerimydra)|Coliseum]] there his base, Badrazel continued to harry those that still resisted the invaders. He patrolled the heights of the cavern and tested the defenses of [[Castle Maerimydra]] on several occasions.",
