        "Powers": "She swallowed a [[Thay|Thayan]] [[wizard]] who was a master of life draining magic and absorbed his abilities.  She was able to extend her life far beyond her normal lifespan by stealing the life force of other creatures.",
        "Description": "Aglaraerose had a unique patch of rough scales on her belly.",
        "History": "As a young adult dragon, she often attacked brigands and ships in the [[Nelanther Isles]]. Some of her foes used powerful [[magic]]s against her, which convinced her to move inland to the [[Shaar]].\n\nShe disappeared from the historical record for centuries but reappeared in [[Veldorn]] in the 14th century DR, where she and the [[red dragon]] [[Klauth]] devoured a horde of [[orc]]s in the [[Spine of the World]] in [[1339 DR]]. She retired to her lair soon after and slept for twelve years. \n\nShe re-emerged in [[1351 DR]] to eat the entire Lost Caravan of [[Taeremel]] near [[Hardcastle (city)|Hardcastle]] in the Shaar.\n\nLater, she forced a group of [[dwarf|dwarves]] to build a trap-filled lair known as the [[Lure of Jaws]], although she compensated them well and allowed them to depart with their lives. The dwarves spread the tale that a lone dragon slept in a lair filled with treasure, which attracted many adventurers, from whom she drained of their life forces.",
