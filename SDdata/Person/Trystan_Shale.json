Shale''' was a librarian of [[Candlekeep]] who served within its hallowed halls during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|I hope you'll forgive my curiosity, but might I ask ― why do you need so much information about Bhaalspawn? What exactly are you working on?|Trystan, in a letter to Elminster.}}",
        "History": "Throughout the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Trystan helped the sage [[Elminster]] correspond to his fellow scholar and member of the [[Avowed]], [[Gorion]], by delivering his incoming letters. The [[1368 DR|following year]], Trystan received one more letter from Elminster, asking about information regarding the [[Bhaalspawn]]. Trystan had the unfortunate duty of informing Elminster that Gorion had left Candlekeep shortly before, along with his ward [[Abdel Adrian|Abdel]]."
