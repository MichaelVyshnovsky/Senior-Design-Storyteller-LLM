        "mainbody": "'''Gerson the Bent''' was one of the [[tiefling]] refugees from [[Elturel]], displaced after the city's [[Descent into Avernus]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Gerson was a tiefling man with red skin, burning yellow eyes, and black hors that betrayed his hellish [[Asmodeus]]'s bloodline. He had black hair gathered in a bun and thick but trimmed beard. He wore a simple [[breastplate]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gerson and all other tieflings within were outcasted from the city of Elturel. The refugees began to follow [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]], who led them west towards the sprawling metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The group was regularly attacked by [[goblin]]s and eventually took refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] within a community of [[druid]]s. However, the tiefling refugees were waylaid by a [[goblin]] army â€“ the [[Cult of the Absolute]], that sought to capture or slaughter the group. Gerson the Bent stayed with the group until the tieflings' fate at the fate of the Emerald Grove were decided."
