Captain '''Samuel Turgat''' was the captain of the ''[[Flyingfish]]'' ship from [[Daggerford]], active ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|''Captain Turgat on ''Flyingfish'' is the only nice captain on the docks. The others just bark orders at us all day!''|Overheard in Daggerford's docks.}}

==Description==
Samuel Turgat was a somewhat lanky middle-aged [[human]] male with dark medium-length hair and a fine mustache that framed his thin mouth.

==Personality==
Captain Turgat was considered the nicest marine vessel captain in Daggerford. Samuel spoke with a thick and put-on pirate dialect, rolling his r's and abusing the words of the trade. However, that was nothing but a show he seldom dropped, thinking that this dialect was expected from a man of his profession. When faced with non-sailors, Turgat felt comfortable enough to speak in his regular eloquent and educated manner.

Unlike many sea-faring folks, Turgat preferred reading to blackout drinking and could often be found doing just that in his cabin.

==Possessions==
[[Trulit & Greegon's claret‎‎]] was one of the goods that Turgat's vessel traded in.

==History==
Samuel Turgat was an alias of a man who used to work at the [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]], a mage library and guild of Daggerford. There the young man read through nearly every book, eventually coming across the book named ''[[Turgat's Revene]]'', a work of fiction. That adventure novel told the story of Captain Samuel Turgat and his sidekick Doctor Algernon. Enamored with dreams of adventures on the high sea, "Samuel" purchased a boat he called ''[[Flyingfish]]'' using his sizable inheritance and legally changed his name to that of the fictional pirate. He hired a crew of "scurvy scallywags" and set to build his new life.

In 1372 DR, Captain Turgat was forced to dock in Daggerford after his ship suffered some damage in a fierce gale. The captain let his crew get drunk on their shore leave as he supervised the repairs. When Samuel Turgat met the [[Hero of Daggerford]], he welcomed the opportunity to speak without the pirate jargon that tired him out. He informed the adventurer about a suspicious [[frigate]] docked next to the ''Flyingfish'', the ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]''. The ship had exclusively been loaded up under cover of darkness from suspicious barges that traveled up the [[Delimbiyr River]].
