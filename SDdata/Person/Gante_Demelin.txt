Lord '''Gante Demelin''' was a [[half-elf]] [[fighter]] and commander of the fortress of [[Undumor|Emmech]], known as ''Undumor'' after its conquest by [[Thayan]] forces. As of {{yearlink|1372}}, he kept his fortress prepared against any eventuality, being uneasy with the peace that there was with the [[Red Wizards]]. Demelin was a marshal of [[Aglarond]] in [[1372 DR]].

He still ruled the fortress in {{yearlink|1375}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|123|11}}
