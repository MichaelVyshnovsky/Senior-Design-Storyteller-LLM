'''Daried Selsherryn''' was a noble [[sun elf]] [[bladesinger]].

==History==
He once lived in [[Cormanthyr]] in an area around what would later be called [[Mistledale]]. There, his family had an estate ringed with a garden and protecting wards and guardians were created to protect the residence and the tombs of the family line.

He and his family later [[Retreat]]ed to [[Evermeet]].

In [[1374 DR]], he was a troop leader of an elven resistance force overlooking the [[River Ashaba]] in the vicinity of his abandoned home and came to revisit it. The estate held a family [[moonblade]] that had lost its powers.
