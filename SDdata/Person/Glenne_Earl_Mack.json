        "mainbody": "Glenne Earl Mack was a cleric-physician and the author of Disorders of the Nerves and Mind A Treatise, who lived sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.\nIn Disorders of the Nerves and Mind A Treatise, Glenne compiled many of the strange disturbances and afflictions of the mind and documented their case studies. One such study was the story of a woman, nicknamed \"R,\" who was troubled by her husband, nicknamed \"B,\" and his temper. According to \"R,\" just three months earlier, \"B\" was afflicted by restless dreams and night sweats. The husband screamed in his sleep about bearing the \"mark of chaos.\" Two months before the physicians visit, \"B\" began calling himself Sarevok. And just a month before, \"B\" became obsessed with the throne he said he was destined to sit upon.\nGlenne paid the couples farmhouse a visit and met \"B.\" The man simply sat at the farmers table, holding a book close to his chest. Glenne detected no possession, no magical influences, nor curses. When the cleric illuminated the afflicted mans face with a candle, \"B\" cried out, brandishing the book \"The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise!\" Glenne managed to grab the book and tossed it into the hearth-fire. To the clerics surprise, the tome burst into black flames and burned into ash. The book left behind nothing but a small scrap of paper that read \"He foresaw his coming death and seeded his essence across the land.\"\nWith the book gone, \"B\" seemingly woke from a nightmare but had no memories of the tome nor claiming to be Sarevok. In the aftermath of the incident, Glenne Earl Mack diagnosed \"B\" with an unspecified neurotic enthrallment and prescribed him a suspension of garlic and drace to be taken orally twice per day."
