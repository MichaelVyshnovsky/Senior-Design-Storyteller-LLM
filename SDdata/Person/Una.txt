'''Una''' was a [[kobold]] [[specialty priest]], or [[morninglord]], of [[Lathander]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
At the age of fifteen, Una was {{SI|2'9|'"|long=yes}} tall and weighted {{SI|39|lb|k|long=yes}}. She had piercing blue eyes and wore priestly [[robe]]s of her god. Una was sensitive to ridicule and picked her garb very carefully, aware of how goofy a kobold in the clothing of a cleric would look.

==Personality==
She was a fast-talking animated woman, knowledgeable of etiquette and proficient in both healing and herbalism. She was a happy-go-lucky optimist overflowing with enthusiasm. She aspired to one day wear shining [[plate armor]] and saved every other meager coin to one day buy a custom-forged set, sending the rest of the money to her temple.

==Abilities==
As a [[morninglord]], Una had access to all spells and miracles granted by her faith. She could ''[[turn undead]]'' and had a unique ability to conjure up ''[[faerie fire]]''. Being a kobold, Una possessed ''[[infravision]]''.

==Possessions==
Una wielded [[club]]s and [[mace]]s and defended herself with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[shield]] â€“ gift of her temple's High Priest.

Her most valued possession was a [[recorder]] that Una played with little provocation. She loved music and hoped to find a teacher to help her master more instruments.

==History==
Una discovered her calling when a group of Lathanderian clergy was captured by a band of kobolds. The young kobold girl snuck into a hut where the [[human]]s were held and offered them a chance to escape in exchange for being taught the priestly ways of the Morninglord. One of the priests offered to take Una to a temple where she would be taught Lathander's teachings. The kobold girl chewed through the ropes that held humans and soon, all three men were free.

The Lathanderians honored the bargain and introduced Una to the temple's High Priest. After hearing her story, the High Priest agreed to teach the kobold, and, to everyone's surprise, Una eventually succeeded. She diligently studied her new religion and human culture. Some observers found Una's progress and rise through clergy ranks to be unnatural and threw racist comments the kobold's way. However, her fellow priests staunchly stood up for Una.

When Una successfully ''turned'' a [[vampire]] with her divine powers, the High Priest announced that she was ready to depart the temple and adventure, spreading Lathander's light onto others. The temple put out a notice, searching for a group of willing adventurers to take Una under their wing, preferably a group of followers of the Morninglord or a band that had a cleric of Lathander as its member.
