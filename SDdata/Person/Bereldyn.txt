'''Bereldyn''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bereldyn was a part of the retinue of the [[Royal Magician of Cormyr]], [[Caladnei]] in early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, when they raided the [[Marsember]] meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]]. He was assigned afterwards to find [[Khornadar]] of [[Westgate]], a mage working with the conspirators, but Caladnei forewarned him [[Laspeera]] thought it may have been a greater mage in disguise.
