|The [[Drow]] have to understand we simply don't have the resources to go after every foolhardy soul who ventures into the ruins. While we've driven out the large monster armies, many foul things still hide in the rubble.<br/>Be warnedâ€”if you decide to go into the ruins, you do so at your own risk.

==Description==
Emalline had pale skin and long blonde hair. She wore an ornate green robe.

|Due to the damaged Mythal, portals to other places open spontaneously, so you will often encounter extra-planar creatures. Then there are things that have been twisted or raised by the powerful magic lingering in the ruins.<br/>There are more mundane threats in Myth Drannor as well. Evil cults have traditionally flocked to the ruins. And I just received reports that there's a band of hostile [[Orc]]s in Myth Drannor right now, scavenging the artifacts and weaponry left behind after the centuries of conflict.
