        "mainbody": "an was a traveling bard from Shadowdale in the midâ€“14 century DR. He often moved across the Dalelands to perform in inns and taverns circa 1357 DR.\nHan was a polite and cheery man who was a good songhorn and tantan player. He happily sang and played with other musicians.\nHan spent his life traveling from Shadowdale to Harrowdale, performing old songs and learning new ones. At one point he met an elf in Cormanthor who taught him a beautiful elven melody that had no lyrics.\nIn 1357 DR, by Tymoras luck his path crossed with a sellsword hero Alias and her traveling companion bard Olive Ruskettle, who were staying at Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale. He played his songhorn with the halfling bard strumming along on her yarting. Han played the elven tune he learned in Cormanthor. Suddenly Alias declared she knew the lyrics to this song about the Standing Stone monument commemorating the Dalesmen and the elves pact from over thirteen centuries past. She compulsively started singing the song, capturing the attention of all present at the inn. She received thunderous applause.\nHan approached Alias and asked her to teach him the lyrics. Even though the sellsword was confused, thinking the song was very common in the Dales, she promised to write the song down for Han and leave it with Jhaele Silvermane, the innkeeper. She kept the promise, leaving Han with Finder Wyvernspurs long-forgotten masterpiece."
