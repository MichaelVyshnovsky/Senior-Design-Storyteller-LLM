        "mainbody": "'''Han''' was a traveling [[bard]] from [[Shadowdale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He often moved across the [[Dalelands]] to perform in inns and taverns ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].\n{{quote|''\"I thought it was a common song in the Dalelands,\" Alias said, growing a little frustrated.<br />\"It will be soon, lady, if you tell me the words. With your permission, I'll sing it from here to Harrowdale.\"''|Alias and Han}}",
        "Description": "Han was a polite and cheery man who was a good [[songhorn]] and [[tantan]] player. He happily sang and played with other musicians.",
        "History": "Han spent his life traveling from Shadowdale to [[Harrowdale]], performing old songs and learning new ones. At one point he met an [[elf]] in [[Cormanthor]] who taught him a beautiful elven melody that had no lyrics.\n\nIn 1357 DR, by [[Tymora]]'s luck his path crossed with a sellsword hero [[Alias]] and her traveling companion bard [[Olive Ruskettle]], who were staying at [[Old Skull Inn]] in Shadowdale. He played his songhorn with the [[halfling]] bard strumming along on her [[yarting]]. Han played the elven tune he learned in Cormanthor. Suddenly [[Alias]] declared she knew the lyrics to this song about the [[Standing Stone]] monument commemorating the Dalesmen and the elves' pact from over thirteen centuries past. She compulsively started singing the song, capturing the attention of all present at the inn. She received thunderous applause.\n\nHan approached Alias and asked her to teach him the lyrics. Even though the sellsword was confused, thinking the song was very common in the Dales, she promised to write the song down for Han and leave it with [[Jhaele Silvermane]], the innkeeper. She kept the promise, leaving Han with [[Finder Wyvernspur]]'s long-forgotten masterpiece."
