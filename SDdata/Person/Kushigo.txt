'''Kushigo''' was a legendary [[monk]] and the original owner of the ''[[Garb of the Land and Sky]]'', active some time before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Despite Kushigo's warrior past, the legendary [[enchanted]] items he left behind, including the ''[[Garb of the Land and Sky]]'', were all lightweight items of cloth and fabric. The ''Garb of the Land and Sky'' was a set of monk's garb that allowed the wearers to use the ''Mountainous Poise'' and ''Breezeswift Speed'' techniques. The ''[[Boots of Uninhibited Kushigo]]'' strengthened the wearer's fists. The ''[[Gloves of Uninhibited Kushigo]]'' possessed the ''Kushigo's Might'' enchantment that improved the wearer's throwing strength and made them proficient with improvised weaponry. Lastly, the ''[[Hat of Uninhibited Kushigo]]'' temporarily increased the wearer's protection from [[spell]]s.

==History==
Long before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kushigo was a [[warrior]] who favored the heaviest of [[plate steel]]s with massive pauldrons that resembled metal [[stag]]'s antlers. Kushigo's fearsome appearance and battle prowess promised doom to his enemies. Then, in one bloody battle atop a hill, [[Irishi]], Kushigo's best friend, was killed in action and scalped. Irishi's bloodied hair was held high above the field of battle by her killer. Kushigo was overcome with rage and griefâ€”he plowed through all of the enemy combatants, leaving behind death and gore, with many ending up skewered by the warrior's antler pauldrons.

After the screams of battle and deaths faded away, Kushigo abandoned his famed plate mail and Irishi's body. He wandered naked away from the battle and across the countryside, devastated by war. Kushigo's mind felt blank, and his soul was filled with grief. Eventually, his mindless wanderings brought the warrior to a wise woman who shared her drinks with the naked man. Drunk and emotional, Kushigo shared his mourning with the woman. She gifted Kushigo light and fine clothes and advised that Kushigo needed time to grieve the loss of his dear friend. He heeded the advice.

Sometime later, after grieving, Kushigo forsook steel and fellowship, taking on the mantle of a monk. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Kushigo's enchanted monk's garb was his legacy and remained in use in the [[Western Heartlands]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
