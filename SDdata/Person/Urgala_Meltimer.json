        "mainbody": "rgala Meltimer was a former adventurer and the owner and innkeeper of Northshield House in Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the late 15 century DR.\nUrgala and her wife Darribeth were adventurers living in Amphail. However, while on an expedition in the Underdark, a fellow adventurer was killed and Darribeth was lost, and Urgala ended her adventuring days.\nUrgala went north and retired to Triboar, where she purchased the Northshield House from the Phorndyl family. She had been its proprietor for over a decade by the mid-1480s DR.\nWhen the fire giants Ildmane and Okssort launched a surprise assault on Triboar at highsun with a force of orogs, magmins, and axe beakâ€“mounted orcs in an effort to retrieve a piece of the Vonindod, which theyd found buried beneath the caravan campgrounds, Urgala aided in the defense of the town against them, together with a band of adventurers. In the aftermath, Urgala suggested the adventurers visit her old companion Harthos at Zymorven Hall to obtain his giant slayer greatsword to aid in their quest against the giants.\nIf adventurers found Darribeth in Undermountain and restored her sanity around 1492 DR, she would travel to Amphail and then Triboar and finally have a happy reunion with Urgala.\nShe liked retirement and was very protective of her home, and was willing to fight to preserve it and the homes of her neighbors. She believed violence was a necessity for survival in a violent world but admonished all guests in the inn bearing weapons to keep them sheathed. \nShe tolerated neither bullies nor monsters, curbing their behavior with a sharp word and a firm hand, or driving them out with violence if necessary. Despite being a former adventurer, Urgala held a deep mistrust for all adventurers, knowing many to be greedy and backstabbing.\nUrgala was a female human of Turami descent, with dark brown skin and black hair. She kept herself fit and could be quite intimidating.\nShe fought in leather armor and a morningstar and a shortbow, with a score of arrows. She was especially skilled in fighting against giants. She spoke both Common and the language of giants.\nUrgala was the owner and proprietor of Northshield House, an inn located in Triboar. Her six staff were loyal and well-paid. She also had three mastiffs that she used for hunting.\nUrgala kept Northshield House clean and quiet, maintaining its good reputation in the region.\nShe was the wife and adventuring companion of Darribeth Meltimer, a wizard.\nAnother former adventuring companion was Harthos Zymorven."
