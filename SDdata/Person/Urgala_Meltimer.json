        "mainbody": "'''Urgala Meltimer''' was a former [[adventurer]] and the owner and innkeeper of [[Northshield House]] in [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Urgala and her wife Darribeth were adventurers living in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]]. However, while on an expedition in the [[Underdark]], a fellow adventurer was killed and Darribeth was lost, and Urgala ended her adventuring days.\n\nUrgala went north and retired to Triboar, where she purchased the Northshield House from the [[Dlukasz Phorndyl|Phorndyl]] family. She had been its proprietor for over a decade by the mid-1480s [[DR]].\n\nWhen the [[fire giant]]s [[Ildmane]] and [[Okssort]] launched a surprise assault on Triboar at highsun with a force of [[orog]]s, [[magmin]]s, and [[axe beak]]â€“mounted orcs in an effort to retrieve a piece of the ''[[Vonindod]]'', which they'd found buried beneath the [[Caravan campgrounds (Triboar)|caravan campgrounds]], Urgala aided in the defense of the town against them, together with a band of [[adventurer]]s. In the aftermath, Urgala suggested the adventurers visit her old companion Harthos at [[Zymorven Hall]] to obtain his ''[[giant slayer]]'' [[greatsword]] to aid in their quest against the giants.\n\nIf adventurers found Darribeth in [[Undermountain]] and restored her sanity around [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} she would travel to Amphail and then Triboar and finally have a happy reunion with Urgala.",
        "Personality": "She liked retirement and was very protective of her home, and was willing to fight to preserve it and the homes of her neighbors. She believed violence was a necessity for survival in a violent world but admonished all guests in the inn bearing weapons to keep them sheathed. \n\nShe tolerated neither bullies nor monsters, curbing their behavior with a sharp word and a firm hand, or driving them out with violence if necessary. Despite being a former adventurer, Urgala held a deep mistrust for all adventurers, knowing many to be greedy and backstabbing.",
        "Description": "Urgala was a female [[human]] of [[Turami]] descent, with dark brown skin and black hair. She kept herself fit and could be quite intimidating.",
        "Abilities": "She fought in [[leather armor]] and a [[morningstar]] and a [[shortbow]], with a score of [[arrow]]s. She was especially skilled in fighting against [[giant]]s. She spoke both [[Common]] and the [[Giant language|language of giants]].",
        "Possessions": "Urgala was the owner and proprietor of Northshield House, an inn located in Triboar. Her six staff were loyal and well-paid. She also had three [[mastiff]]s that she used for hunting.",
        "Activities": "Urgala kept Northshield House clean and quiet, maintaining its good reputation in the region.",
        "Relations": "She was the wife and adventuring companion of [[Darribeth Meltimer]], a [[wizard]].\n\nAnother former adventuring companion was [[Harthos Zymorven]]."
