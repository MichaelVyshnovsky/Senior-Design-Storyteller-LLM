Omskilar Rethwood was an outlaw as well as a member of the Company of the Cloak.
He loved to kill, often slaying specific individuals with a single crossbow bolt. Failing this, Omskilar would attach a scroll with a message to a bolts shaft in order to intimidate targets.
Along with all of the other members of the Company of the Cloak, Omskilar possessed an immunity to oil of taggit (which caused unconsciousness).
