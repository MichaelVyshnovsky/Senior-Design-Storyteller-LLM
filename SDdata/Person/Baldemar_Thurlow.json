        "mainbody": "'''Baldemar Thurlow''' was the Speaker of [[Lonelywood]] of the [[Ten Towns]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Baldemar is a country-grown man, simple as dirt. He likes to think he's above everyone else because he's got some coin. Someday I'd like to see a smart halfling come in here and show these bumpkins a thing or two about how to run a small town.''|Grand Syndar Quinn Silverfinger}}",
        "Description": "Speaker Thurlow was a [[human]] man with a fair skin tone. He wore gray nobleman's finery.",
        "Personality": "Baldemar was an opportunist who preferred to settle things swiftly and quietly, mostly because he was bad at negotiating and bargaining. He did not tolerate criticism from [[Tybald Dunn]], a local cooper, and threatened to withhold caravan contracts from him.",
        "History": "Baldemar Thurlow begin his career as a cartwright who made his fortune by supplying caravan wagons to costers in the far [[Northwest Faerûn]]. With that money, he entered an arranged marriage with [[Arden Thurlow]]. After the happy couple relocated to Lonelywood, he became a self-appointed representative of all the tradesmen of Lonelywood who took on dealing with the caravans that passed the town and in turn, it led to him being elected the town speaker. His interest in the position was purely motivated by [[coin]]. Baldemar was faced with a great challenge when the [[barbarian]] king [[Wylfdene]] united the [[Uthgardt]] tribes of the [[Tribe of the Bear|Bear]], the [[Tribe of the Elk|Elk]], and the [[Tribe of the Great Whale|Great Whale]] to drive the southern peoples of the [[Ten-Towns]] away from Icewind Dale in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. Lonelywood became the prime target for the barbarian army that broke camp not far from it. The Ten Towns showed little confidence in Baldemar's political and negotiation skills and sent their own representative to deal with Wylfdene's horde. Instead of trying to settle the crisis peacefully, Baldemar, through the councilman of [[Targos]], hired an [[assassin]] to end Wylfdene's life and threat to Lonelywood. [[Purvis]], the assassin, however, was unable to fullfil the contract. When the word of the assassin got out, the barbarian camp doubled the guard, making Wylfdene unreachable. As the adventurers investigated the threat, Wylfdene's true identity was revealed, and the barbarian was put to the sword. Unwilling to gain the reputation of a failure, Purvis assassinated Speaker Thurlow, wife Arden Thurlow, and just needed to finish off the last witnesses of his failure – the Heroes of Icewind Dale. It was unknown if the confrontation had taken place, but if it did, Purvis's life would've been forethought."
