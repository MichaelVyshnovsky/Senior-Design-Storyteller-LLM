'''Dorthy Winters''' was the daughter of [[Beartrid Winters]] and [[Kalas Winters]], who worked at the [[Wolf's Pelt Inn]] in the [[Icewind Dale]] community of [[Targos]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Dorthy was a beautiful and charismatic 17-year-old young woman. She was quite short compared to most humans of the region, being {{SI|5'5|'"|long=yes}} tall and weighing {{SI|110|lb|k|long=yes}}. She had long black hair and big brown eyes.

==Personality==
Dorthy was quite strong-willed and always achieved her goals and needs. Her parents put her to work in the kitchen to be able to keep an eye on her. That did not stop Dorthy from sneaking out at every opportunity she got.

==Possessions==
She carried her trusty kitchen [[knife]] with her.

==History==
Around [[Tarsakh]], [[1369 DR]], Dorthy lived with her family in the [[Ten Towns]] and constantly tried to slip out of the kitchen to avoid work.
