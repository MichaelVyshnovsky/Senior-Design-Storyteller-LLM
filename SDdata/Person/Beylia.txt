'''Beylia''' was an acolyte in the [[Morningstar Haven]], the temple to [[Lathander]] in the city of [[Westgate]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Beylia was a young woman, but her hair was streaked with grey, and crow's feet could be seen around her eyes.

==History==
By [[1374 DR]], Beylia had been an acolyte for thirteen years. Before that, she led a slaver's life in Westgate's criminal underbelly known as the [[Undergate]]. She served [[Kajeel]], the so-called [[psion]] Master of Undergate, but abandoned her old life to serve the Morninglord. She retained a special token that allowed individuals passage to Kajeel through a guarded ''[[gate]]'' in Undergate. She was afraid of revealing that in front of her superiors at the Morningstar Haven, as she was supposed to dispose of the token by their orders when she joined. It was believed that she parted with the token one way or another, giving it to an adventurer who sought to discover the secrets of a ''[[cursed]]'' mask associated with the [[Night Masks]] in 1374 DR.
