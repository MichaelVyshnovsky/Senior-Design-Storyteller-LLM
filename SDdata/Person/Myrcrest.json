        "Description": "Although resembling a [[raven]], Myrcrest was much larger, being about 50% wider and longer in the wings than a regular specimen. Its feet were pale and fleshy and ended in {{SIAdj|3|inch|c|long=yes|adj=long}} talons, and its eyes glowed or reflected greenish-yellow light. Stranger still, its feathers had no sheen, instead seeming dull and even absorbing light. It could be quite intimidating to those unused to it.",

He and [[Lindavar]] received it well, but [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] was frightened of it."
