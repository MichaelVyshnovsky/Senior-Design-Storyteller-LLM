        "mainbody": "'''Mehmet al-Nassar''' was an [[elf|elven]] theologian who lived in [[Hilm]], the City of Kindness.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|2}}",
        "History": "Mehmet was an outspoken lecturer who condemned the actions of [[holy slayer]]s. News of his preaching reached the ears of the Grandfather of the [[Everlasting]], who decided to put an end to the heresy.\n\nA holy slayer disguised himself as a student, enrolling at the university where Mehmet taught. One day, the holy slayer confronted Mehmet in his private office under the pretense of discussing an issue. The slayer drew a knife and threatened to end Mehmet's life. After a brief struggle, Mehmet pleaded for his life to be spared. The slayer, seeing an opportunity, decided to spare Mehmet's life. A deal was struck between the two where the holy slayer would pay Mehmet on a yearly basis if he started preaching the positive aspects of brave [[Hajama]], and Mehmet's life would also be spared for every year so long as he never condemned the holy slayers again."
