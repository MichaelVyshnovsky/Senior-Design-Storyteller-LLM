        "mainbody": "'''Severin Silrajin''', usually known simply as '''Severin''', was the [[Red Dragon]] [[Wyrmspeaker]] and the main leader of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Severin was a true visionary, bringing new life and power to the Cult. However, he was also young and prone to underestimating his enemies or not seeing enemies posing as friends.",
        "Activities": "Unlike other members of the Cult of the Dragon before him, Severin believed that living dragons earned the devotion of the lesser races, rather than those that were [[undead]].{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|14}}\n\nSeverin also had a notable interest in the ''[[Wyrmskull Throne]]'', the massive artifact associated with the rule of [[giant]]kind.",
        "Abilities": "The cult leader was quite intelligent and was well-versed in multiple languages including [[Draconic language|draconic]] and [[Infernal language|infernal]].\n\nAt the apex of his power and abilities, Severin acted with a charismatic authority akin to dragonkind and possessed supernatural resistance to harm and the elements. He could readily manipulate flames at will, ''[[teleport]]'' himself and others in a fiery inferno, and could bind others in magical [[chain]]s associated with the [[Nine Hells]].",
        "Possessions": "During his travels across the Realms with the cult, Severin came into possession of the ''[[Red Dragon Mask]]''.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Dragon Masks.png|thumb|right|350px|Severin Silrajin and the cult's other [[wyrmspeaker]]s, with the five [[dragon mask]]s.]]\nThe charismatic cult leader attracted many allies to his cause, including the five powerful wyrmspeakers, and many [[chromatic dragon]]s. Notable among those dragons were [[Vartilingorix]], and even [[Lostmauth]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 4}}\n\nHe was however still opposed by some members of the cult's \"old guard\", including the [[Wearer of Purple]] [[Ixas]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows Over the Moonsea|5}}\n\nSeverin had a [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]] named [[Nelvik]].",
        "History": "As a young [[Calishite]] member of the Cult of the Dragon, Severin was inspired by [[Tiamat]] to carefully reread the version of [[Maglas]]'s ''[[Chronicle of Years to Come]]''—translated by [[Sammaster]] as \"naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers, but the dead dragons shall rule the world entire...—and ultimately came to believe that the correct translation was \"naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire...\", a translation that many sages believed correct but heretical with respect to Sammaster's words. Thus the beings that should be the targets of their devotion were not [[dracolich]]es but living [[dragon]]s. Armed with this new conviction, Severin decided he needed to meet and speak to a living dragon.\n\nHe went to [[Mintarn]], to the lair of the famous dragon [[Hoondarrh]]. Severin managed to befriend the terrible dragon, impressing both Tiamat and his fellow cultists. Thus, Tiamat gave him knowledge of the [[dragon mask]]s, which could be combined into a powerful artifact called the ''Mask of the Dragon Queen''. Severin discovered the whole history of the dragon masks and in long years of travel he recovered all five masks. These he gave to his most trusted friends, and saved the ''Red Dragon Mask'' for himself. With a reputation gained from this search, Severin quickly rose through the ranks of the Cult until he became the main leader.\n\n[[File:Tiamat ToD comic.png|thumb|right|350px|''Severin with the [[Mask of the Dragon Queen]], standing before [[Tiamat]] herself.'']]\nDuring the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Severin began a plan to summon Tiamat into [[Toril]] to bring Maglas's prophecy to pass. He also allied with the exiled [[Red Wizards of Thay]] to gain the magical power necessary for the ritual.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 3}} to the [[Lair of Lostmauth]] on [[Tuern]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 5}} and back to the mainland of [[Faerûn]].\n\nSeverin's plans very nearly came to fruition: after gathering a treasure hoard worthy of Tiamat and assembling an army of dragons and other evil creatures to, he used the souls of hundreds of prisoners to raise [[Tiamat's Temple]] from [[Avernus]] into the [[Well of Dragons]] and began the ritual to summon Tiamat herself into [[Faerûn]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 8}} He and his forces were ultimately defeated by the army of the [[Five Factions]]{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}} and their [[metallic dragon]] allies,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}"
