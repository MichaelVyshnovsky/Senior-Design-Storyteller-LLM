There, prior to 1473 DR, she transformed the farmer Khault, who was fleeing from his destroyed village, into an aberration and he gathered a cult around her.\nIn 1479 DR, Khault sent members to Airspur to recruit. The Choir kidnapped several residents of Airspur, including the twin sister of a genasi named Ghaelya who the cult believed to be a prophetess. With the help of Uthalion and a few of his friends, Ghaelya traveled to Tohrepur, where one of her friends killed Khault and destroyed the Blue Lady."
