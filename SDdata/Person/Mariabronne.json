        "mainbody": "'''Mariabronne the Rover''' was a [[human]] [[ranger]] of the [[Bloodstone Lands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was famous throughout the lands of [[Damara]] and was often called \"The Tamer of [[Vaasa]]\".\n{{Quote|''That was who he was and how he played: always on edge and always just skilled enough or lucky enough to sneak out of whatever trouble his adventurous character has found.''<ref>}}",
        "Description": "At about 40 years of age, Mariabronne's face showed the hardship that came with more than 20 years of battles. His fairly long and thick brown locks were usually unkempt and covered his ears and neck, complementing his scruffy beard. Still, he was considered rugged and quite handsome with his brown eyes shining with a luster of youth more fitting of a man half his age. His grin could be both commanding and mischievous. His lean but finely muscled body was often covered by dirty garb.",
        "Personality": "Despite wearing a constant scowl, Mariabronne was easy-going.\n\nBeing acquainted with King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], Mariabronne knew how to behave at court. Still, he had never been fond of the pretension and the elevation of class.\n\nThe ranger judged a person by their actions alone, despite any rumors about them.",
        "History": "Mariabronne was the long-time student of the ranger [[Olwen Forest-Friend]] and even grew to be as close to a son as Olwen ever had.\n\nMariabronne had risen through the ranks of the [[Bloodstone Army]] in the years during [[Bloodstone Wars|the war]] with [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King, in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}. He also offered his services as a scout, guide, and guardian to travelers and adventurers setting out from the [[Vaasan Gate]], and was known to only charge what he thought his clients could afford.\n\nTogether with the Bloodstone Army commander [[Ellery Dragonsbane]], the dwarves [[Athrogate]] and [[Pratcus]], the mage [[Canthan Doolittle]], the [[half-orc]]s [[Arrayan Faylin]] and [[Olgerkhan]], and the assassin [[Artemis Entreri]] and his drow friend [[Jarlaxle]], Mariabronne went to defeat one of the Witch-King's constructs, a castle much like [[Castle Perilous]]. After breaking through the castle's primary defenses, the Rover scouted through tunnels, going further than commanded, as befitting his reckless nature. The Rover engaged a group of [[gnoll]] [[mummies]], and there, distracted by the appearance of [[guardian daemon]]s, took a severe neck wound that punctured a major artery from one of the mummies. He proceeded to slay multiple daemons and mummies, seemingly not noticing the wound until he attempted to taunt a daemon and found that he was coughing blood. He succumbed to blood loss soon after.\n\nLater, during a battle with a [[black dragon]] [[dracolich]], his corpse was reanimated, along with the corpse of Ellery Dragonsbane, whom Artemis Entreri had slain with a prick to the heart after she attacked Jarlaxle at the behest of the [[Citadel of Assassins]], and [[Canthan Doolittle]], who had similarly been in the employ of the Citadel of Assassins, and had similarly died at the hands of Entreri. All three corpses were destroyed in that battle.",
        "Possessions": "Mariabronne's favorite weapon was [[Bayurel]], his renowned [[bastard sword]], a solid, thick blade enchanted with a special hatred for [[giant-kin]]. Upon examining his deceased body, Jarlaxle noticed that the ranger wore a [[ring]] and a suit of [[armor]] with [[item enchantment|minor enchantment]]. However, Jarlaxle took from Mariabronne a magical ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'' that transformed into a [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmare]] mount, which he gifted to Artemis Entreri.<ref>"
