        "mainbody": "ergeant Hazz Yorrum was the leader of the garrison of Neverwinters soldiers in the High Tower of Thalivar in Leilon in the late 15 century DR.\nYorrum was sluggish and corrupt, and he acted cowardly.\nWhen Leilon was resettled in the late 15 century DR, Yorrum was in charge of the local garrison for Neverwintan soldiers representing Dagult Neverembers interests in Leilon. His task was to defend the settlers during the towns reconstruction,\nYorrum left most decisions to the town mage Gallio Elibro.\nCirca  1491 DR, Leilon was attacked by the Cult of Talos and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out. The settlers gathered outside of Leilon and were in panic, so Yorrum attempted to calm them. However, when the Talosian cultists attacked the gathered settlers, Yorrum immediately fled. Luckily, a group of adventurers arrived just in time to defeat the attackers and reclaim the town.\nThe House of Thalivar that housed the garrison was haunted by the ghost of Thalivar. The wizards spirit drove away Yorrum and three of his soldiers (Erlum, Gori, and Koz). However, the town mage Gallio Elibro refused to leave. Neither Gallio himself nor Yorrum had any idea that Thalivars ghost took possession of Gallio every night. Yorrum sent the same adventurers to take care of the ghost.\nDuring a patrol in the Mere of Dead Men, Private Vester Jessup and three other of Yorrums soldiers went missing. Yorrum wasnt worried about them, but when pressed by Vesters friend Breltora Red-Eye and the adventurers, he showed them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued the missing soldiers who had been captured by a lizardfolk tribe.\nThe same group of adventurers would be called upon to perform several more services to help Leilon grow and to protect it from rising threats from both followers of Talos and followers of Myrkul. During this time, Yorrum served as a member of the Leilon town council, When the cults launched an attack on the town&mdashin a conflict known as the Battle of Leilon&mdashYorrum abandoned his soldiers and fled, leaving it to the adventurers to rally his troops."
