        "mainbody": "Sergeant '''Hazz Yorrum''' was the leader of the garrison of [[Neverwinter]]'s soldiers in the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] in [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Yorrum was sluggish and corrupt, and he acted cowardly.",
        "Activities": "When Leilon was resettled in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Yorrum was in charge of the local garrison for Neverwintan soldiers representing [[Dagult Neverember]]'s interests in Leilon. His task was to defend the settlers during the town's reconstruction,",
        "Relationships": "Yorrum left most decisions to the town mage [[Gallio Elibro]].",
        "History": "''Circa '' [[1491 DR]], Leilon was attacked by the [[Cult of Talos]] and the townsfolk and laborers were driven out. The settlers gathered outside of Leilon and were in panic, so Yorrum attempted to calm them. However, when the [[Talos]]ian cultists attacked the gathered settlers, Yorrum immediately fled. Luckily, a group of [[adventurers]] arrived just in time to defeat the attackers and reclaim the town.\n\nThe House of Thalivar that housed the garrison was haunted by the [[ghost]] of [[Thalivar]]. The wizard's spirit drove away Yorrum and three of his soldiers ([[Erlum]], [[Gori]], and [[Koz]]). However, the town mage Gallio Elibro refused to leave. Neither Gallio himself nor Yorrum had any idea that Thalivar's ghost took possession of Gallio every night. Yorrum sent the same adventurers to take care of the ghost.\n\nDuring a patrol in the [[Mere of Dead Men]], Private [[Vester Jessup]] and three other of Yorrum's soldiers went missing. Yorrum wasn't worried about them, but when pressed by Vester's friend [[Breltora Red-Eye]] and the adventurers, he showed them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued the missing soldiers who had been captured by a [[lizardfolk]] tribe.\n\nThe same group of adventurers would be called upon to perform several more services to help Leilon grow and to protect it from rising threats from both followers of Talos and followers of [[Myrkul]]. During this time, Yorrum served as a member of the Leilon town council, When the cults launched an attack on the town&mdash;in a conflict known as the [[Battle of Leilon]]&mdash;Yorrum abandoned his soldiers and fled, leaving it to the adventurers to rally his troops."
