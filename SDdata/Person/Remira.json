        "mainbody": "Remira was an archer that roamed the Western Heartlands circa the late 15 century DR.\nRemira often wore a leather jerkin when She fought with a bow with a green grip.\nAt some point Remira applied with Ansurs Finest adventurers guild of Baldurs Gate. Even though Sevrin Bask, recruitment officer, was impressed with the archers field expertise, he decided against allowing her to join, citing the excessive use of words such as \"pay\" and \"bounty\" that were at odds with the culture of Ansurs Finest.\nIn the  Remira and her fellow adventurers Aradin and Barth were chased by Zakrugs goblinoids towards the gate of the Emerald Grove. They were not allowed access until the leader of the local tieflings, Zevlor, granted permission. By that time however, the goblins were already upon the front gates of the grove."
