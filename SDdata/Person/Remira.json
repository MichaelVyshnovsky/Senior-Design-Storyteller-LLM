        "mainbody": "'''Remira''' was an archer that roamed the [[Western Heartlands]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Remira often wore a leather jerkin when She fought with a [[bow]] with a green grip.",
        "History": "At some point Remira applied with [[Ansur's Finest]] adventurers' guild of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Even though [[Sevrin Bask]], recruitment officer, was impressed with the archer's field expertise, he decided against allowing her to join, citing the excessive use of words such as \"pay\" and \"bounty\" that were at odds with the culture of Ansur's Finest.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}} Remira and her fellow adventurers [[Aradin]] and [[Barth (adventurer)|Barth]] were chased by [[Za'krug]]'s [[goblinoid]]s towards the gate of the [[Emerald Grove]]. They were not allowed access until the leader of the local [[tiefling]]s, [[Zevlor]], granted permission. By that time however, the goblins were already upon the front gates of the grove."
