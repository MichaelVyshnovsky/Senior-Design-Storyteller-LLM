        "mainbody": "'''Naljier Skal''' was a [[human]] [[bard]] who had been sent to [[Spellhold]] to try and undo the damage that had been magically inflicted upon his mind.\n\n{{quote|''I used to have pretties piled high to the sky... don't remember where they are though... Mm, pretties...''|Naljier Skal}}",
        "History": "Naljier Skal's full history is a mystery, but it was said that he was once a great bard of some repute. However, by [[1369 DR]], he had been magically afflicted, reducing his mind to that of a child's, which led to his subsequent incarceration in Spellhold. It is unknown when this damage was inflicted, or how; all that was known by the [[Cowled Wizards]] who took him into their care was that his last project had been into the nature of the universe and what lay beyond the [[god]]s, with [[Jon Irenicus|the Spellhold Coordinator]] musing that something apparently didn't like him looking.\n\nHe was among the asylum inmates present in Spellhold when [[Gorion's Ward]] came to the institute in pursuit of [[Imoen]] and [[Jon Irenicus]]. Likewise, he was among the inmates who rallied behind the [[Bhaalspawn]] and their promise of vengeance against Irenicus' cruel experiments, only to perish in the ensuing battle.",
        "Abilities": "Despite his shattered mind, Naljier was still able to access some kind of hidden pocket [[plane]], where he had stashed a fortune in [[gem]]stones. However, because of his madness, he no longer recognized them for their monetary value, instead taking a childish comfort in \"pretties\". If spoken to with sufficient kindness, he would respond by withdrawing a gem from this stash and then giving it to the person who had been nice to him.\n\nNaljier also retained his full spellcasting abilities, which combined with his child-like personality made him incredibly dangerous if unsupervised."
