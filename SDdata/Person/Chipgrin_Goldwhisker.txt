'''Chipgrin Goldwhisker''' was the leader of the [[deep gnome]] [[wererat]]s in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Chipgrin was a smart and reasonable leader and he was polite yet firm when negotiating with others.

==History==
In the late 1400s DR, Chipgrin emerged as the leader of [[Clan Goldwhisker]],

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he acknowledged the threat of the [[Pudding King]] and was considering offering the help of his people to [[Dorbo Diggermattock]] in exchange for a formal recognition that they were citizens of Blingdenstone like the others. He also noted the strange behavior of the regular deep gnomes of Blingdenstone who'd been afflicted by the [[demon lord]] [[Juiblex]]'s madness, while the bestial wererats were not.
