        "mainbody": "Crown Prince '''Kuskur Heltharn''' was a regent ruler of [[Impiltur]].",
        "Relationships": "Kuskur was the third son of King [[Imphras II]] through the king's second wife, [[Rebaera Osterhown]]. He had two older half-brothers, [[Talryn]] and [[Lashilmbrar]], and three younger brothers&mdash;the twins [[Velimbrar]] and [[Elphras]] and [[Fylraun]].\n\nKuskur was married to [[Elthinda Balindre]], who was the daughter of [[Telflamm]]'s merchant prince, and together they had a single son, named [[Thaum]].",
        "History": "Kuskur was born in the [[1205 DR|Year of Seven Trinkets, 1205 DR]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\" /> After he came of age, he married his wife and moved to her home city of Telflamm. Their son was born while they were living there.\n\nUnbeknownst to Prince Kuskur, his son had aspirations to the throne of Impiltur and secretly orchestrated the murders of King Lashilmbrar (Kuskur's half-brother), Queen [[Thelmara Rorntarn|Thelmara]], Crown Prince [[Imphras III]], and Prince [[Rilimbrar]] in the [[1294 DR|Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR]]. Only Rilimbrar escaped death. While Thaum failed to become king, the deaths left Rilimbrar, Thaum's step-cousin, as the new king of Impiltur and promoted Kuskur to become the new Crown Prince.\n\nKuskur agreed to return to Impiltur and serve as regent over the kingdom until his half-nephew Rilimbrar came of age, and he acted in this role from 1294 to [[1296 DR]].\n\nStill unwilling to abandon his dreams of the throne, while his father was away, Thaum took advantage of the old age of his mother's father, and stole money from the city-state of Telflamm to hire an army of mercenaries.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|71}}\n\nSince they could not access the treasury of Impiltur while in exile, Kuskur and Rilimbrar were unable to rally forces to retake the kingdom. Instead, Kuskur sought the aid of Queen [[Ilione]] of Aglarond, who agreed to help. She sent her powerful and mysterious disciple, the [[Simbul]] to assassinate Thaum, which she easily did in [[1296 DR]].\n\nRilimbar, now sixteen-years-old, returned to Impiltur to take back the throne, but Kuskur remained in [[Velprintalar]], in self-imposed exile, because of the disgrace he felt from the evil acts of his only son.\n\nKuskur died in Aglarond two years later in [[1298 DR]]."
