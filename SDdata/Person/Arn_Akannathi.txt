Arn Rockfist Akannathi  was the chieftain of the Akannathi goliaths of Skytower Shelter during the late 15 century DR.
He had a deep and imposing voice.
Chieftain Arn was not a particularly patient or subtle leader and would not hold back from ordering violence against others when provoked.
He shared his cave within Skytower Shelter with his husband, Harad and his elderly mother-in-law Kaniaka.
The Akannathi clan maintained a years-long feud with the Thuunlakalaga goliaths of Wyrmdoom Crag, originating from a series of unfortunate events that led to a wounded child and slain Akannathi griffon.
