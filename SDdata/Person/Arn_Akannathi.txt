'''Arn Rockfist Akannathi''' {{Pronounce|ARN|ah|kah|NAH|thee|refs=}} was the chieftain of the [[Akannathi]] [[goliath]]s of [[Skytower Shelter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had a deep and imposing voice.

==Personality==
Chieftain Arn was not a particularly patient or subtle leader and would not hold back from ordering violence against others when provoked.

==Relationships==
He shared his cave within Skytower Shelter with his husband, [[Harad Akannathi|Harad]] and his elderly mother-in-law [[Kaniaka Akannathi|Kaniaka]].

The Akannathi clan maintained a years-long feud with the [[Thuunlakalaga]] goliaths of [[Wyrmdoom Crag]], originating from a series of unfortunate events that led to a wounded child and slain Akannathi [[griffon]].
