'''Ulthlo Relajatyr''' was a security worker who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Ulthlo was second in command of security within [[the Gentle Mermaid]] gambling hall and tavern in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. Specifically, he was in charge of directing the bouncers and staff working the floor of the Mermaid. He took his job seriously, usually planning things several steps ahead, and was dedicated to making the Gentle Mermaid a safe place to gamble. Ulthlo was adept at anticipating the skills of [[thieves]] and the use of [[magic]] to cheat the tavern.
