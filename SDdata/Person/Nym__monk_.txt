Nym was a monk of Ilmater at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
Nym was born and raised at the monastery. However, he left in order to do good in the name of Ilmater in the outside world. Instead he went mad.
Circa 1489 DR, he went back at the monastery and soon rose through its rank. Inside the monastery, Nym found an elemental node, and at the same time he was approached by the Cult of the Howling Hatred and he joined them. Nym helped the cultists to infiltrate the monastery in 1491 DR.
Nym had become mad in the outside world. He had hoped to cure himself by coming back to the monastery, but this had not worked. Thus his hatred grew to the point that he wanted to destroy the world and for this reason he joined the cultists. However, he was resentful of the scarce consideration he received from the cultist leader Bloodwind and deep in his heart Nym hoped that their ritual would fail spectacularly.
Nym was a monk in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, and a member of the Order of the Scroll of the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred. His duty was as Master Teacher.
