        "mainbody": "'''Naleen''' was an orphan [[tiefling]] [[monk]] of the [[Broken Ones]] from the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in [[Damara]].",
        "Appearance": "Naleen had straight, long, pitch-black hair and ghostly-pale skin, the legacy of her [[demon]]ic mother. Like other monks, Naleen did not wear armor, with her fists being the weapon. She did carry a [[dagger]] and was proficient with a [[sling]].",
        "History": "Naleen was born to an [[Amn]]ian nobleman and a member of the [[Church of Helm]] [[Don Di'Armos]] and a mysterious woman he met during an expedition to Damara. After Naleen was born, her mother dropped her disguise, revealing her true demonic nature to Don Di'Armos. The mother was destroyed by the cleric, and Naleen was abandoned with monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, the secret of her existence was revealed to [[Sirge de La Sunya]], the son of Don Di'Armos. After the nobleman's death, Sirge, now a [[paladin]] of Helm, set out to find his long-lost sister. Eventually, he assembled an adventuring fellowship – [[The Winter Rose]] and found Naleen at the faraway monastery. Unsure how to proceed, Sirge introduced himself as The Watcher and invited the young monk to join the adventuring group, the offer Naleen gladly accepted yearning to explore the world outside the Monastery of the Yellow Rose's walls."
