'''Gavilon Jostins''' was the ex-adventurer mayor of the city of [[Elbulder]] as of 1372 DR.

==Background==
Gavilon Jostins became the mayor soon after [[Aldorn Thuragar]] became the ruler of [[Sespech]]. When [[Chondath]]an soldier attacked Elbulder with the intention of capturing it, Gavilon dispatched them with ''[[fireball]]s'' and ''[[lightning bolt]]s''. It was after this amazing display that the citizens of Elbulder came to agree that having [[wizard]]s on hand might come in hand now and again.
