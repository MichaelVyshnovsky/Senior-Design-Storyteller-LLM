Gavilon Jostins was the ex-adventurer mayor of the city of Elbulder as of 1372 DR.
Gavilon Jostins became the mayor soon after Aldorn Thuragar became the ruler of Sespech. When Chondathan soldier attacked Elbulder with the intention of capturing it, Gavilon dispatched them with fireballs and lightning bolts. It was after this amazing display that the citizens of Elbulder came to agree that having wizards on hand might come in hand now and again.
