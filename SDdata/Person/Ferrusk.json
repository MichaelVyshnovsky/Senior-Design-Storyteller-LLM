        "mainbody": "'''Ferrusk''' was a corrupted [[druid]] that lived in and underneath the [[Misty Forest]] on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Turn back. I'll not help you when you run afoul of my children. You have been warned.|''Ferrusk, to intruders.''}}",
        "Personality": "Ferrusk was driven to madness, presumably by his research into and use of dark druidic magic.",
        "Abilities": "The dark druid had taken up residence within a corrupted grove on the banks of the subterranean [[Nepenthe]] river and gathered for himself an army of [[ankheg]]s that he referred to as his \"children\".\n\nHe was quite skilled at medicinal techniques, able to form curative agents from naturally-found substances; such as a [[fungus]]-nullifying [[potion]] made from the bloom-sac of a [[myconid]].",
        "Possessions": "He wore a unique suit of [[bloody bone plate|plate armor made from bone]], and wore a [[amulet of abnormally awesome ankheg summoning|magical amulet]] that he had [[item enchantment|enchanted]] himself.",
        "Activities": "Ferrusk was once part of a druidic circle that venerated a sacred tree in the Misty Forest, near the cavernous entrance that led down to the Nepenthe River.<ref group=\"note\">While the cave's location in the forest is not explicitly stated in ''[[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear]]'', the location of the above-ground entrance to the river is stated on page 20 of the ''[[Hordes of Dragonspear]]'' adventure novel. The magic he practiced after leaving the group corrupted the druids' sacred tree.",
        "Relationships": "He was once considered close companions of his fellow druids, [[Jamven]] and [[Chorster]].",
        "History": "During the [[War of the Shining Crusade]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Ferrusk allied himself with [[Hephernaan]], the religious advisor to the Shining Lady [[Caelar Argent]]."
