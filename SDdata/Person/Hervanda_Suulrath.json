        "mainbody": "Reverend Mother Hervanda Suulrath was a high priestess of Ilmater inhabiting Yeshpek along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHervanda led the Bloody Sash which was a temple dedicated to Ilmater. However, given the churchs viewpoint that the crafters of Yeshpek needed to lower the cost of their goods in order to make them more affordable for everyone, the congregation within the temple was practically nonexistent."
