'''Baerdagh''' was a former warrior living in [[Ripplestones]] during the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He carried a walking stick.

==Relationships==
He was a friend of fellow senior [[Caladaster Daermree]], and was known to local tavernkeeper [[Alnyskawer]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|663-666|13}}

==History==
At some point, Baerdagh was known as the Lion of Elversult. At least one of his stories in the line of duty involved high-born lasses in [[Cormyr]] who were trying to kill each other. He received some sort of medal for a different mission.

Baerdagh was sitting with his neighbor Caladaster when, in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, [[Elminster Aumar]], who was wandering, offered them a meal in exchange for information on Ripplestones, where the sorceress [[Sharindala]] had died. Initially offended by the man eating by their table, he was slow to be mollified, being rightfully suspicious, but was in favor of accepting the meal, knowing that Alnyskawer already knew they wouldn't be able to afford it, so the man most certainly would have already paid. After sharing the information with him, unable to eat all of the food that was purchased, Baerdagh and Caladaster took most of it to go. Elminster turned up the next morning and told them he was still heading east, despite their warnings about [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]] being that way. 

Later, when the scholars [[Tabarast]] and [[Beldrune]] rode into town accompanying a [[Harper]] who remained [[Azuth|nameless]], one of them almost rode Baerdagh down; the man was trotting a little recklessly, because he heard a weeping noise coming from [[Scorchstone Hall]]. He later found the three horsemen had joined his friend Caladaster for a second early evenfeast; they discussed Elminster's prior doings. After Caladaster volunteered to join them, Baerdagh seemed a little down about the fact his days as a warrior were over. The Harper reassured him and casually mentioned he'd been the Lion of Elversult, much to his surprise, claiming Harpers were meant to remember the heroes of old. The tavernkeeper, Alnyskawer, then got him to tell the people there a bit more of his war stories.
