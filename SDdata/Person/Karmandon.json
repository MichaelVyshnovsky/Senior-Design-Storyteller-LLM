        "mainbody": "Karmandon was a Netherese rogue and fashionista who owned Karmandons Finery in Karsus Enclave until its destruction in .\nKarmandon was a skilled and relentless pathological liar. He was particularly adept at verbally backstabbing his own associates, then denying all wrongdoing through a combination of logical reasoning and rhetorical agility. Despite these efforts, he was still well-known as an prolific liar.\nKarmandon sold fashionable clothing, sets of jewelry, and other accoutrements, but his shop started to shrink with the rise of Chanragouptas Exotic. Unable to compete in the field of business, he turned to vicious rumor-mongering in the hopes of destroying his rivals reputation."
