'''Askarran''' was a warrior and [[sage]] inhabiting [[Selgaunt]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Askarran's research focused on theology, cult history, and the nature of [[undeath]].

Of note, he insisted that nothing was known on what would happen when a [[dracolich]] would reach such bodily degradation that it reached nigh-[[demilich]] status, remarking it was unwise to speculate.{{Cite dragon/110/Cult of the Dragon|9}}
