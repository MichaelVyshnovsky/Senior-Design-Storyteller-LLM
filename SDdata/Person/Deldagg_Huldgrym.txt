Deldagg Huldgrym was a dwarven adventurer who founded the Bloodaxe Mercenary Company around 1317 DR.
Deldagg was an outcast from Adbarrim, known as a "transgressor" against the teachings of Moradin, who led his fellow dwarven outcasts to form the Bloodaxe Mercenary Company. His organization was originally predominantly dwarven, and Deldagg and his troops distinguished themselves in conflicts with bandits, an army of orcs led by King Eldoul, and raiders from Luskan. He lost many fellow dwarves during these battles, leading him to recruit humans and other races into the company from places like the Sword Coast (notably Baldurs Gate), the North, the Vilhon Reach, and Westgate.
Deldagg died in 1331 DR of blacklung fever and was succeeded by Velkor Minairr as leader of the Bloodaxes.
