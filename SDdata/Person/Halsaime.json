        "First [[Jussko Kwahn|that bard]], and now you. I don't know where your [[Oriphaun Huntsilver|precious nobleman]] is. He can't have [[Halsaime's staff|his staff]] back, anyway.

        "When you die — which you will — and the forest consumes you, you will be part of my new nature. For why should I preserve, when I can create anew? Such power is mine.\n|Halsaime\n}}\nHalsaime had a number of powerful druidic magical abilities, including being able to transform into a [[wolf]] and [[bear]], and being able to call down spells like ''[[enveloping swarm]]'', ''[[fire storm]]'', ''[[storm of vengeance]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[sunburst]]'', and ''[[creeping doom]]''. His terrible staff allowed him to twist the minds of people and nature itself, and create the novel [[red musk creeper]] and its [[red musk zombie|zombies]].": "=History==",

Die?!\n|Halsaime\n}}\nHalsaime was a respected member of Thorngap, a circle of druids in the [[King's Forest]]. Following the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], the [[adventurer]] [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]] overcame a [[Shadovar]] spellcaster and captured their staff. Realizing that the staff was a powerful and dangerous artifact, Oriphaun dropped it off with his friend Halsaime while he pursued his investigations elsewhere. Although a powerful and wise druid, Halsaime's mind was overcome by its influence, turning from a friendly and helpful folk hero to a murderous and domineering tyrant that sought the destruction of everything that wasn't aligned with nature.\n\nHe set about spreading his magically-enhanced ideology, and while [[Carm Woodrusk]] resisted and was killed, many others did not. He spread his affliction to his fellow druids and [[ranger]]s, as well as the local plants, animals, and nature spirits, creating an army of minions to perform his bidding. These plans came to fruition when the noble ranger [[Peron Uthe]] was infected and carried it to [[Eveningstar]], causing [[Uthe Lodge]] and the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] to become overrun by red musk zombies and severely misanthropic beings like the [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]]. With the threat evident, the [[Harpers]] sent [[Jussko Kwahn]] to investigate the formerly upstanding druid, and they worked with adventurers to break into Thorngap and the [[Druid's Deep]] where Halsaime was hiding with his closest followers. Jussko found him in his sanctum only to be [[petrified]], followed later by his adventurer allies who engaged Halsaime in battle. Although Halsaime called down mighty spells and shapeshifted into bear and wolf forms, he was ultimately overcome and slain. His death broke the petrification forced upon Jussko, who produced a magical scroll and used it to \"safely\" destroy the cursed staff that had caused all those problems.",
