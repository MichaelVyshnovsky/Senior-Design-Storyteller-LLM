        "mainbody": "alsaime was an elder druid of Thorngap during the late 15 century DR. He was driven mad by a strange and powerful staff, and became a ruthless and murderous master of nature.\nUnder the influence of his staff, Halsaime became grandly megalomaniacal and destructive, envisioning a new natural order set in place by himself.\nHalsaime had a number of powerful druidic magical abilities, including being able to transform into a wolf and bear, and being able to call down spells like enveloping swarm, fire storm, storm of vengeance, earthquake, sunburst, and creeping doom. His terrible staff allowed him to twist the minds of people and nature itself, and create the novel red musk creeper and its zombies.\nHalsaime was a respected member of Thorngap, a circle of druids in the Kings Forest. Following the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon, the adventurer Oriphaun Huntsilver overcame a Shadovar spellcaster and captured their staff. Realizing that the staff was a powerful and dangerous artifact, Oriphaun dropped it off with his friend Halsaime while he pursued his investigations elsewhere. Although a powerful and wise druid, Halsaimes mind was overcome by its influence, turning from a friendly and helpful folk hero to a murderous and domineering tyrant that sought the destruction of everything that wasnt aligned with nature.\nHe set about spreading his magically-enhanced ideology, and while Carm Woodrusk resisted and was killed, many others did not. He spread his affliction to his fellow druids and rangers, as well as the local plants, animals, and nature spirits, creating an army of minions to perform his bidding. These plans came to fruition when the noble ranger Peron Uthe was infected and carried it to Eveningstar, causing Uthe Lodge and the Eveningstar War Hospital to become overrun by red musk zombies and severely misanthropic beings like the dryad Sylvie. With the threat evident, the Harpers sent Jussko Kwahn to investigate the formerly upstanding druid, and they worked with adventurers to break into Thorngap and the Druids Deep where Halsaime was hiding with his closest followers. Jussko found him in his sanctum only to be petrified, followed later by his adventurer allies who engaged Halsaime in battle. Although Halsaime called down mighty spells and shapeshifted into bear and wolf forms, he was ultimately overcome and slain. His death broke the petrification forced upon Jussko, who produced a magical scroll and used it to \"safely\" destroy the cursed staff that had caused all those problems."
