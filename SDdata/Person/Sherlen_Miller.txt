Sherlen Miller was the commander of the militia and the constable in Daggerford around 1485 DR.
Her dual role meant Sherlen had to use two different aspects of her personality as a militia commander, she trained her fellow warriors as constable, she had to mediate disputes and take care of the dukes interests.
Sherlen considered it a great honor serving in the same role as her namesake Sherlen Spearslayer. She preferred her role as commander, feeling she did not suit the diplomatic role she had as constable.
