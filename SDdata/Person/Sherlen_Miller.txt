'''Sherlen Miller''' was the commander of the militia and the constable in [[Daggerford]] around [[1485 DR]].
 
==Activities==
Her dual role meant Sherlen had to use two different aspects of her personality: as a militia commander, she trained her fellow warriors; as constable, she had to mediate disputes and take care of the duke's interests.

==Personality==
Sherlen considered it a great honor serving in the same role as her namesake [[Sherlen Spearslayer]]. She preferred her role as commander, feeling she did not suit the diplomatic role she had as constable.
