        "mainbody": "'''Q'arlynd Melarn''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] of [[Sshamath]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Originally from [[Ched Nasad]], he was the only surviving noble of [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]] in that city after its collapse.",
        "Description": "Q'arlynd sported a slightly crooked nose after a childhood [[riding lizard]] accident that left it broken. In spite of this fact, he was still handsome enough to hold the attention of most females. His shoulder-length white hair was worn in a contingency clip that rested at the back of his neck.\n\nAn [[Church of Eilistraee|Eilistraeean]], Q'arlynd bore a crescent-shaped scar on his right palm from when he took his [[Sword Oath]].",
        "History": {
            "Possessions": "Q'arlynd's ''[[piwafwi]]'' was made from the blue-black fur of a [[displacer beast]]. Another of his items was the clear [[Rock crystal|quartz]] crystal that hung from his neck on a [[silver]] chain, which granted him the ability to see anything that had been disguised or rendered invisible by magical means.\n\nOf all of his personal items, Q'arlynd's most important was with him at all times. More often than not rendered magically invisible as a safety precaution, Q'arlynd wore a ''selu'kiira'' on his forehead filled with the sentience of all of his ancestors that had worn the stone before him since before dark elves were branded [[Dhaerow]] and forced into the Underdark."
