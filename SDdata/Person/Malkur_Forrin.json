        "mainbody": "'''Malkur Forrin''' was a military commander in [[Sembia]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Malkur was a tall man with grey hair and a mustache. He had many scars on his arms and his right eye drooped because of an old wound.",
        "Personality": "Malkur was only interested in coin. He was ambitious and amoral.",
        "History": "Malkur was a general of the Sembian army until he was dismissed by [[Kendrick Selkirk]] for his excessive brutality. He then decided to create his personal mercenary army, the [[Blades (mercenary group)|Blades]]. Often he worked as an escort for the [[Six Coffers Market Priakos]] caravans and for more darker jobs.\n\nOn [[Marpenoth 29]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Mirabeta and her niece [[Elyril Hraven]] summoned Malkur to Mirabeta's mansion of [[Ravenholme]]. They asked that his army attack the [[Saerloon]] delegation while posing as men from [[Selgaunt]] and Saerb and in exchange Mirabeta promised him much money and the position of commander general of the Sembian army. In addition, Mirabeta hired him to kill [[Miklos Selkirk]] and [[Kavin Selkirk]].\n\nMalkur and his men located the position of Miklos and Kavin through [[divination]]s and, on [[Uktar 1]], ambushed them. After fierce fighting, Malkur's men managed to kill the two Selkirk brothers. Meanwhile, Malkur's disguised men quickly and efficiently attacked the Saerloon delegation.\n\nHowever, on [[Uktar 5]], Malkur led a contingent to attack the Selgaunt delegation, composed of new [[hulorn]] [[Thamalon Uskevren II]], [[Erevis Cale]], and their companions. But thanks to the timely arrival of troops from Saerb led by [[Abelar Corrinthal]], the attack failed and Malkur retreated.\n\nOn [[Uktar 11]], Mirabeta reproached Malkur for his failure against Selgaunt but appointed him Commander General with orders to attack Saerb immediately and destroy it.\n\nAfter some of his troops destroyed the [[Corrinthal Estate]] and took prisoner Abelar's son [[Elden Corrinthal]], Malkur delivered his orders for the attack on Saerb the next day, on [[Uktar 29]]: make an example of the town, destroying and killing everyone and sacking anything of value. On [[Uktar 30]], Malkur Forrin led the Sembian army to attack Saerb in northern Sembia, setting the town ablaze.\n\nOn [[Nightal 1]], at Abelar's request, Erevis Cale and [[Drasek Riven]] infiltrated Forrin's camp to rescue Elden and capture Malkur. Cale first healed Elden and took him to safety. Afterward, with his [[spell]]s, Cale kidnapped Forrin and took him to the ruin of the Corrinthal Estate, where Abelar was waiting. After a furious duel, Abelar killed Malkur Forrin as he surrendered.\n\nThe next day, Malkur's army assembled to avenge his abduction with an attack against the Saerbians' camp near [[Lake Veladon]]. But they incautiously entered the just-formed [[Shadowstorm]] and they were all killed and turned into [[undead]]."
