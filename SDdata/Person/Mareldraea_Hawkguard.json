        "mainbody": "Lady Mareldraea Hawkguard () was the ruler of Shadowdale in the late 15 century DR.\nMareldraea had an average stature and physique, with disheveled black hair and gray eyes.\nLady Mareldraea Hawkguard was a calm and easygoing individual with a gentle voice and a demeanor that exuded warmth. Despite her affable nature, she possessed a steely resolve and stubbornness that belied her outward appearance. Fearless and unyielding, she couldnt be intimidated by anyone or anything.\nShe held a deep reverence for Shadowdale, viewing it as a vital community where humans, fey, and elvenkind coexisted harmoniously. Her vision for the advancement of Shadowdale focused on sustainable practices, such as improving irrigation, drainage, and crop yields while prioritizing soil renewal and environmental harmony.\nMareldraea was the great-granddaughter of Mayheir Hawksguard.\nDespite her political clashes with other dale leaders, like Scardale and Archendale, Lady Hawkguard had a knack for reconciling differences and building personal relationships. Dalefolk regarded her as one of their own, appreciating her genuine interest in their lives and well-being.\nAs of the early 1490s DR, Mareldraea was unwed and had no public partner.\nIn 1490 DR, aware that her mental faculties were beginning to decline, Lady Khara Sulwood started training successors. In Nightal of the , she resigned the lordship and handed the Twisted Tower over to Lady Mareldraea."
