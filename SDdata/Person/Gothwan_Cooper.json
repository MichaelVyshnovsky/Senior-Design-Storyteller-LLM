        "mainbody": "'''Gothwan Cooper''' was a thief who lived in the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a member of the [[Nashers]] faction of the [[Sons of Alagondar]],",
        "Personality": "While he considered himself to be a loyal Nasher, he would readily double-cross those who wronged him, believing loyalty applied both ways.",
        "Relationships": "Gothwan enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the boss [[Karzov]] for some time, until one big job they pulled off went awry.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, taking advantage of the chaos resulting from the [[undead]] assault on Neverwinter led by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], Gothwan and his friend [[Honor Reigh]], under orders from the Nasher leader Karzov, sneaked inside the [[Hall of Justice]] and stole the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]''. Spotted by an adventurer, the pair escaped with the crown; Gothwan sold his share of other loot and went into hiding in the Blacklake District, figuring he'd be safe with the Nashers. Unfortunately, Karzov abandoned him, declaring in a note that he had no time to protect Gothwan while he planned a revolution. Some time later, the [[Dead Rats]] gang kidnapped Gothwan in order to bargain his life for the ''Crown'', which they wanted for themselves. However, the Nashers' leaders had no interest in saving Gothwan's life.\n\nLuckily for him, an [[adventurer]] recruited by Sergeant [[Knox]] was searching for the crown and in the process infiltrated the Dead Rats' hideout in the [[Blacklake Sewers]] in order to interrogate Gothwan. Grateful for saving his life, Gothwan told the adventurer all he knew about Karzov's and the crown's whereabouts."
