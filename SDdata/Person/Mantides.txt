'''Mantides''' was a former [[paladin]] of [[Lathander]] living in [[Westgate]] around [[1374 DR]].

{{quote|''That'll be Mantides. A bloody sad tale, is his. He used to be a paladin of the Morninglord. A great tragedy befell him, and he now spends all his time drowning himself in drink. He still knows how to fight - even put [[Gregory]] down in a brawl recently. Ain't many folks done that.''|[[Little Davey]]}}

==Possessions==
When he served the [[church of Lathander]], Mantides wore an expensive suit of armor he gotten rid of after it was stained with shame and blood of his victims. He wielded a holy [[enchanted]] sword called the ''[[Dawnbringer (sword)|Dawnbringer]]''.

==History==
Mantides's lover [[Tasheni]] disappeared while investigating the [[Night Masks]] so Mantides decided to focus on destroying the evil guild. One day, Mantides was sent to by Lady Sunrise [[Tylanna]] of the [[Morningstar Haven]] to the [[Sword Lane]]. Rumors had it that the Night Masks claimed one of abandoned warehouses there as heir warehouse. He quickly confirmed that the warehouse was indeed occupied by the Night Masks. Instead of returning to Tylanna, Mantides became consumed by vengeance. In his zeal, he viciously killed eight young Night Mask members with one escaping, the event called the [[Sword Lane]] massacre of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, and for this he was expelled from the church of Lathander, leaving him a broken man, often drowning his sorrows in [[ale]].

Around the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Mantides was said to had joined an adventurer who just recently arrived to Westgate to fighting the Night Masks. The adventurer witnessed Mantides being harassed by [[Screeb]] and other drunken ruffians in the [[Black Eye]] tavern in Westgate harbor. The drunkards accused Mantides of being a washed out drunk, insinuated he host his holy [[sword]] and that the church took his manhood when it stripped Mantides of paladinhood. Despite harassment, Mantides did not stoop to violence.

Mantides did not recognize the adventurer but their other companion, a woman named [[Rinara]], looked familiar. She revealed that she left Westgate three years prior, right after the Sword Lane massacre. Mantides realized that the one Night Mask who escaped the massacre was Rinara. The fallen paladin restrained his rage, believing Rinara's words of not being responsible for Tasheni's death.
