'''Josef Darag''' was the master of the Duchy of [[Springhill]] in [[Damara]] as of {{yearlink|1373}}. On [[Mirtul 19]], he was returning from riding to join [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] in the fight against the [[Bandit Army]] of [[Vaasa]], after receiving news that King Gareth had been slain by [[Zhengyi]]. They explained this situation to [[Karasendrieth]]'s party along the way.{{cite book/The Rite||1}}
