'''Andorn''' was a looter that worked for the [[gnome]] [[Gimblebock]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The man had light brown hair and wore a [[leather armor]]. Andorn fought with a [[rapier]], and when fighting, assumed a fencing style while holding a [[torch]] in the other hand. He carried a small bottle of a mysterious liquid that had dried up.

==History==
In the 1490s [[DR]], Andorn and his fellow looters were trying to find their way further into a [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|crypt]] in [[West Faerûn]], somewhere between the cities of [[Elturel]] and [[Baldur's Gate]]. He stood guard behind a locked ornate door that he held the key to.
