'''Iolrak''' was the lieutenant under the command of the Overseer [[Fanraet]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Iolrak and three of his fellow wizards were tasked with researching and excavating the ruins of the ''Room of Words'' in [[Onaglym]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. The cultists turned over every recorded and found every ''glyph'' and ''word of power'' they could in the records but were still unable to find the correct ''word'' to separate the ''[[ring of calling]]'' from the skeletal ulna and hand the ring was magically attached to. The Cult of the Dragon knew of the ''ring of calling'' and its ability to access certain parts of the ruined city. Subsequently, Iolrak faced with the [[Veiled Ones]], the group of heroes working against the Cult of the Dragon. The lieutenant and his fellow cultist wizards perished in the battle. The heroes discovered the ''Word of Oblivion'', the Cult was searching for, "Rhesheshannen" during their journey through the [[Dwarven Dungeon]]. Upon the ''word of power'' being spoken, the bones holding the ''ring of calling'' crumbled to dust, allowing the Veiled Ones to claim the ancient prize.
