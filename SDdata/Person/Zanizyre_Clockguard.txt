'''Zanizyre Clockguard''' was a famous and fearsome [[gnome]] [[warlock]] of [[Tiamat]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had tan skin, light brown hair, and hazel eyes. She was {{SI|3|feet|c|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|38|pounds|k}}.{{Cite dragon+/32/Young Adventurer's Guides: Beasts & Behemoths}}

==Personality==
Despite her patron being indisputably [[evil]], Zanizyre herself was a kind and cheerful do-gooder who always sought to aid the downtrodden with her powers, although this was perhaps a form of atonement for evils demanded by Tiamat. Indeed, Zanizyre was unable to disobey the orders of her patron, and would sometimes commit terrible crimes in her name. These weighed heavily on her, and occasionally sent her into bouts of melancholy. Despite this, Zanizyre expressed no desire to be released from her contract with Tiamat.

Zanizyre was curious and restless, rarely staying in one place in an endless quest for learning. She valued nothing more than solving a good mystery, and was reckless in the pursuit of knowledge.

==Abilities==

In battle, Zanizyre was deadly and unpredictable, and favored [[fire]] magic. She possessed a [[Pact of the Blade|pact boon]] in the form of a [[short sword]] known as ''Tiamat's Fang'', which was imbued with the powers of each of Tiamat's five heads and allowed Zanizyre to choose its [[element]] whenever she summoned it. This gave her the flexibily to fight with fire, [[cold]], [[acid]], [[lightning]], or [[poison]] as she needed.

She had the power to cast ''[[Dominate monster|dominate dragon]]'', which allowed her to compel [[dragon]]s to serve her despite their usual resistance to such spells. She rarely used this power except in exceptional circumstances.

==History==
Zanizyre never revealed exactly how she came to be one of the very few mortals directly gifted power by Tiamat, and would only say that it was "fate". Rumors abounded, with the most common tale suggesting that she had earned Tiamat's favor by rescuing an injured dragon [[wyrmling]] and bringing it to one of Tiamat's temples. Others suggested that she had sold her [[soul]] for knowledge.

In her many journeys, she became beloved by many small communities for her timely interventions against attackers. Even so, it was wise to be wary of her presence given Tiamat's terrible reputation.

At some point in the 15{{th}} century DR, Zanizyre passed through [[Longsaddle]] with three dragon hatchlings in tow, having rescued them from a [[cyclops]] in the [[Anauroch]]. The staff at the [[Gilded Horseshoe]] rushed to feed her and her dragons despite their depleted larder for fear of incurring Tiamat's wrath. The dish they invented went on to be served at the tavern.
