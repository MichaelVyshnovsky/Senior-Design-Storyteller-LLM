'''Fenkenkabradon Dokaan''' was a [[dragonborn]] warrior member of [[Clan Fenkenkabradon]]. He was also the commander of the [[Lance Defenders]] 

==Description==
Dokaan was a tall dragonborn with bronze-colored scales.

==Relationships==
Dokaan was the younger brother of [[Fenkenkabradon Ishkhanak]].

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], during the [[invasion of Tymanther]] by the [[ash giants]], Dokaan took part in the operation to laid siege to [[Ashhold]] and kill the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]].

In 1486 DR, Dokaan was Clan Fenkenkabradon's candidate for the elections to chose the new [[Vanquisher]], that were expected to be celebrated in [[1487 DR]]. He was the candidate with the most weak claim to the title, due to his poor skills as a commander.

During the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]], Dokaan was in charge of leading the forces protecting both [[Djerad Thymar]] and the Tymantheran supply lines.
