'''Radija''' was a Mistress of Souls, a [[necromancer]] of [[the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Radija wore the cult's dark-red colored uniform robes with the holy symbol of the Absolute adorning her chest and an [[enchanted]] ''[[Myrkulite scourge]]'' at her side. This [[human]] woman had dark brown skin and long curly brown hair. Her face was decorated with a painted design around her eyes.

==History==
In or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Radija joined the ranks of the Absolutists. However, she never became the [[True Soul]]. Like other necromancers of the cult, she served General [[Ketheric Thorm]] and followed the deity of death – [[Myrkul]]. Because of that, Radija looked down on other cultists, especially the True Souls, who were infected with altered [[illithid]] tadpoles. Trusted servant of Ketheric Thorm's, Radija resided within the Moonrise Towers and stood guard of the towers' rooftops – the area off-limit to all. When the battle started between the Absolutists of the towers and the group of heroes who opposed them, aided by [[Harper]]s, Radija was presumed slain in the struggle shortly before the adventurers confronted and ended the unlife of General Ketheric Thorm.
