He directed the War Wizards at the time of King Forils reign with confidence, and had a sharp intellect.\nGanrahast blamed himself for the death of Princess Jemra Rhindaun, as he was of the belief that her death at the hand of assassins aimed at King Azoun V was caused by a failure of one his wards. He shared this guilty sentiment with no one, however.\nAlthough his magical abilities did not appear to rival those of his predecessors, he was a competent and level-headed spellcaster.\nHe had the ability to blend in with others, letting him learn more of their intentions then they would otherwise give away willingly. His sharp and even morbid intellect allowed him to foresee threats most people wouldnt have even considered.\nGanrahast was born in the , the son of Myrmeen Lhal, the long-serving Lady Lord of Arabel.\nAfter the death of Caladnei in the , Laspeera assumed the role of Court Wizard and began tutoring Ganrahast to assume the role of Royal Mage.\nIn the , it was Ganrahast who discovered that Crown Prince Emvar had fathered a son prior to his death.\nIn the , Ganrahast was imprisoned by one of Manshoons servants in magical stasis in a crypt beneath the Royal Palace in Suzail.

As such, he had two sisters Myrmeens adopted daughter Krystin His niece was Nalara Marliir, daughter of Krystin.\nHis closest friend was his second-in-command, the Lord Warder Vainrence.
