        "mainbody": "'''Ganrahast Aeiulvana''' was the Royal Mage of [[Cormyr]] and Chairman of the [[College of War Wizards]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|47}} Known in his childhood only as '''Ganrion''', he was the son of [[Myrmeen Lhal]] and [[Vangerdahast]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|17}} He lived for over a century.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|11}}",
        "Description": "Ganrahast had brown eyes and crimson hair. By [[1479 DR]], despite having lived over a hundred years, his red hair was only then beginning to show streaks of silver.",
        "Personality": "He didn't have the presence of either of his famous parents\n\nOn the other hand, as public figure, he was very different. He directed the War Wizards at the time of [[Foril Obarskyr I|King Foril's]] reign with confidence, and had a sharp intellect.\n\nGanrahast blamed himself for the death of Princess [[Jemra Rhindaun]], as he was of the belief that her death at the hand of assassins aimed at [[Azoun Obarskyr V|King Azoun V]] was caused by a failure of one his wards. He shared this guilty sentiment with no one, however.",
        "Abilities": "Although his [[magic|magical]] abilities did not appear to rival those of his predecessors, he was a competent and level-headed spellcaster.\n\nHe had the ability to blend in with others, letting him learn more of their intentions then they would otherwise give away willingly. His sharp and even morbid intellect allowed him to foresee threats most people wouldn't have even considered.",
        "History": "Ganrahast was born in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the son of [[Myrmeen Lhal]], the long-serving Lady Lord of [[Arabel]].\n\nAfter the death of [[Caladnei]] in the {{YearlinkName|1399}}, Laspeera assumed the role of Court Wizard and began tutoring Ganrahast to assume the role of Royal Mage.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1438}}, it was Ganrahast who discovered that [[Emvar Obarskyr|Crown Prince Emvar]] had fathered [[Erzoured Obarskyr|a son]] prior to his death.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|11}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Ganrahast was imprisoned by one of [[Manshoon]]'s servants in magical stasis in a crypt beneath the Royal Palace in Suzail. [[Elminster]] and [[Vangerdahast]]'s shade rescued Ganrahast but he missed King Foril's Dragon Council.",
        "Relationships": "Ganrahast was of course the son of Myrmeen Lhal and Vangerdahast.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|4}} As such, he had two sisters: Myrmeen's adopted daughter [[Krystin]] His niece was [[Nalara Marliir]], daughter of Krystin.\n\nHis closest friend was his second-in-command, the Lord Warder [[Vainrence]]. Though Ganrahast was unsure of the more bellicose direction Vainrance sought to take the War Wizards in, he hadn't reined him in up until at least 1479 DR."
