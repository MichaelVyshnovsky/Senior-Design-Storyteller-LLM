Priestess of the High Moonlight '''Rian Liurandel''' was a [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] priest and the leader of the [[House of the Moon]] in [[Bloodhand Hold]] (later known as [[Waterdeep]]) during the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|757}}, during her time at the House of the Moon, Rian was informed of the charges laid against the [[New Moon Pact]] by High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in far away [[Chancelgaunt]] in [[Sembia]]. Believing that the Pact had indeed fallen to the heresy of believing [[Shar]] and [[Selûne]] the same being, she supported the charges and condoned the extermination of the Pact.
