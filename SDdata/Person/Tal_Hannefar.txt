Tal Hannefar was a town guard who lived in the settlement of Idyllglen.
Tal was present in Idyllglen when Yeenoghu assaulted the settlement with his demonic horde. During the battle, Tal and the other guards bravely defended their fellow citizens, but were covered in demon ichor. This caused them to go insane and crave the flesh of humanoids.
