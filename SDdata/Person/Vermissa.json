        "mainbody": "'''Vermissa''' , also known as '''The Undying One''', the '''Queen of Worms''', and '''Matron of Ghouls''', was an ancient [[lich]] inhabiting the island of [[Sahu]] in the [[Crowded Sea]] in the early 1400s [[DR]].{{Ne-time}}",
        "Description": "Vermissa's body was remarkably well-preserved given her age. She retained the figure of a voluptuous young woman. In contrast, her face appeared to carry all of the ravages of time where her withered skin was stretched tight over her skull. Infernal flames burned bright in her empty eye sockets.\n\nVermissa often used magic to disguise her appearance and could suppress other physical attributes of liches, such as ''[[chill touch]]'' and ''[[fear aura]]'', at will.\n\nHer voice was often soft and sweet when entertaining visitors, in which she enjoyed singing. However, if enraged, her voice assumed a malevolent tone that bespoke of true infernal power.",
        "Personality": "Vermissa was a master manipulator and politician with the patience and long-term planning of a true immortal.",
        "Possessions": "Vermissa had access to a range of powerful items including a purple [[gown]] that was actually an enchanted ''[[robe of eyes]]'', a [[gold]] earring that was an ''[[ioun stone]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +3'', a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'', a ''[[staff of withering]]'', a gold armband that was a ''[[talisman of divining]]'', and a trio of ''[[Handglyph of power|handglyphs of power]]''.\n\nVermissa's most unique item was a [[Vermissa's choker|valuable electrum choker]] that was adorned with a lavish [[emerald]] that served as a ''[[helm of telepathy]]''. The choker was covered with writhing worms.",
        "History": "Vermissa lived on Sahu as a mortal when the first [[Necromancer Kings]] rose to power. Her founding of the [[Cult of Worms]] directly challenged the power of [[Uruk]]. Aware of Vermissa's power and devotion to her foul god [[Thasmudyan]], Uruk and eight of his barons decided a direct confrontation was suicide. Instead they lured Vermissa to the [[Garden of Eternity]] where they trapped her inside with nine seals of power.\n\nUruk and his barons left Vermissa to die, but Thasmudyan had different plans for his [[Chosen]]. Thasmudyan granted his high priestess the gift of lichdom, allowing her to endure long after Uruk and his future successors had faded to dust.",
        "Activities": "Though she was prevented from leaving the Garden of Eternity, others could enter and leave at any time. This allowed Vermissa to rebuild the Cult of Worms to carry out her plans in the world above, not just on Sahu, but even extending to mainland [[Zakhara]].\n\nOutside of the Cult of Worms, Vermissa entered into a mutually beneficial bargain with the philosopher [[Kazerabet]]. In exchange for access to Vermissa's impressive library and aid in becoming a [[lich]], Kazerabet agreed to destroy one of the nine glyphs that kept her imprisoned.\n\nThrough her pawn [[Pizentios]], Vermissa built a school of [[necromancer]]s on Sahu that she would use to find and destroy all remaining seals of power so she could attain her ultimate freedom.",
        "Skills & Abilities": "In addition to her powers as a high priestess and lich, Vermissa could project herself into any undead on Sahu, allowing her to see through their eyes."
