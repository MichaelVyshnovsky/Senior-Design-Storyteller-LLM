        "mainbody": "Iyawaei of Konghani was a sea captain in 1357 DR. His ship sailed to Kozakura sometimes. He ruled his ship with an iron fist and his crew feared him. Iyawaei was good humored but with a quick temper. His biggest flaw was speaking with a strong accent and using many incomprehensible foreign words and phrases in conversation."
