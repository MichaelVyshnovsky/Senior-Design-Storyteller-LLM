'''Baerlatha Luruin''' was a [[wizard]], [[potion]] maker, and animal healer who lived at [[the Healing House]] in [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was quietly spoken.

==Description==
Baerlatha was a thin woman who had steel-gray eyes and ash-blonde hair.

==Abilities==
Although quite proficient as a mage, Baerlatha rarely spoke of it or her abilities. She was also a talented dancer.

==Relationships==
She was the wife and assistant of the priest and healer [[Chanczlatha Luruin]]. Together, they had a sizable family of children the couple had adopted.

==Activities==
Along with mothering the children, Baerlatha spent a lot of her time creating potions for her husband and ministering to unwell beasts.

She would also cast [[spell]]s for hire if requested, asking 1,000 [[gp]] for lesser spells and 2,000 [[gp]] for greater spells. She would never go beyond sight of Bargewright Inn's walls, however, being unwilling to go adventuring anymore.While ''Volo's Guide to the North'' says "Baerlatha will not go adventuring anymore, though." it is not clear if she is a former [[adventurer]] herself or if she is simply no longer willing to accompany adventurers to provide magical aid.
