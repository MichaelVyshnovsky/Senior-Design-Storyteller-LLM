Baerlatha Luruin was a wizard, potion maker, and animal healer who lived at the Healing House in Bargewright Inn in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was quietly spoken.
Baerlatha was a thin woman who had steel-gray eyes and ash-blonde hair.
Although quite proficient as a mage, Baerlatha rarely spoke of it or her abilities. She was also a talented dancer.
She was the wife and assistant of the priest and healer Chanczlatha Luruin. Together, they had a sizable family of children the couple had adopted.
Along with mothering the children, Baerlatha spent a lot of her time creating potions for her husband and ministering to unwell beasts.
She would also cast spells for hire if requested, asking 1,000 gp for lesser spells and 2,000 gp for greater spells. She would never go beyond sight of Bargewright Inns walls, however, being unwilling to go adventuring anymore.While Volos Guide to the North says "Baerlatha will not go adventuring anymore, though." it is not clear if she is a former adventurer herself or if she is simply no longer willing to accompany adventurers to provide magical aid.
