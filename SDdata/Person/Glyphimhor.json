        "Activities": "Glyphimhor ruled the metropolis of [[Orcusgate]] on the [[Layers of the Abyss]] ruled by Orcus. He knew the workings of the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]''.",
        "Personality": "Glyphimhor was a typical [[balor]]. He cared nothing for his subordinates but was worried if his city would be damaged. Usually Glyphimhor did not kill personally, preferring to use his ''[[symbol of discord]]'' and ''[[symbol of stunning]]'' or his ''[[telekinesis]]'' powers.",
        "Relationship": "Orcus trusted Glyphimhor but he was still a [[demon]] and if he found a truly successful chance Glyphimhor would betray his lord."
