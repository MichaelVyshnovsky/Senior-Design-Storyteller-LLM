He knew the workings of the Wand of Orcus.\nGlyphimhor was a typical balor. He cared nothing for his subordinates but was worried if his city would be damaged. Usually Glyphimhor did not kill personally, preferring to use his symbol of discord and symbol of stunning or his telekinesis powers.\nOrcus trusted Glyphimhor but he was still a demon and if he found a truly successful chance Glyphimhor would betray his lord."
