However, he somehow acquired a cursed item that transformed his interest in the dungeon into a true obsession.\nIn 1363 DR, Yeldoon died and according to his last wishes he was buried in a crypt inside the second level of Undermountain. Somehow, thanks to the cursed item, he rose as an undead and created other undead around him.

He sent two nephews, Eurikos and Phariseus, to Waterdeep to find him. When Eurikos and Phariseus discovered Yeldoons story, they tried to find someone to recover the wealth inside Yeldoons crypt.\nYeldoon resided inside his crypt with all his wealth and his cursed item. His wight and allip were linked and perfectly coordinated.\nYeldoon was a charismatic man with an interest in Undermountain.
