Filina Shintar was a half-elven priestess and Queen of Dambrath during the 11th century DR.
Filina was the daughter of Dambraths first queen, Cathtyr Shintar.
Filina grew tired of waiting for her mother to die of natural causes, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. She murdered her mother so she could become the queen of Dambrath. 
As fate would have it, Filina only ruled for 5 short years before her daughter, Cathakay did the same thing to her.
