'''Filina Shintar''' was a [[half-elven]] priestess and Queen of [[Dambrath]] during the 11th century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Filina was the daughter of Dambrath's first queen, [[Cathtyr Shintar]].

==Activities==
Filina grew tired of waiting for her mother to die of natural causes, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. She murdered her mother so she could become the queen of Dambrath. 

As fate would have it, Filina only ruled for 5 short years before her daughter, [[Cathakay Shintar|Cathakay]] did the same thing to her.
