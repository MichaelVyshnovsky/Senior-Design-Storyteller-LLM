Brem was an agent of the Zhentarim that operated out of their hideout along the Risen Road in the late 15 century DR.
He was an unscrupulous and downright awful man that was willing to abduct and sell others in order to make a profit.
Brem served as the primary merchant for those granted access to their cavernous hideout. He could only sell basic items, such as poison or lockpicks to most travelers, and had to wait for approval to show visitors the "good stuff".
In the , Brem and his accomplice Garias kidnapped the famous Baldurian artist Oskar Fevras while the painter was vacationing in the countryside away from the city. They did not necessarily have a plan following the abduction, but were willing to sell him to others for profit.
