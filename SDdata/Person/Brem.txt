{{Quote|Want your portrait done? If you have the gold, my pet artist will make you a most heroical likeness.}}

==Personality==
He was an unscrupulous and downright awful man that was willing to abduct and sell others in order to make a profit.

==Activities==
Brem served as the primary merchant for those granted access to their cavernous hideout. He could only sell basic items, such as [[poison]] or [[lockpicks]] to most travelers, and had to wait for approval to show visitors the "good stuff".

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Brem and his accomplice [[Garias]] kidnapped the famous Baldurian artist [[Oskar Fevras]] while the painter was vacationing in the countryside away from the city. They did not necessarily have a plan following the abduction, but were willing to sell him to others for profit.
