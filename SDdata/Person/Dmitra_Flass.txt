Dmitra Flass, also known unofficially as the First Princess of Thay or The Tharchioness, was the Tharchion of Eltabbar within the realm of Thay during the mid-to-late 14 century DR, and subsequently the Zulkir of Illusion among the Red Wizards during the War of the Zulkirs. She was also a powerful figure in Mulmaster following her marriage to that city states ruler, High Blade Selfaril Uoumdolphin.
Dmitra had been dubbed the "First Princess of Thay"&mdashalthough only outside of Thay itself&mdashowing to her famous beauty. She specifically cultivated an "exotic" look with her clean-shaven head and elaborate tattoos (which she maintained as per Thayvian noble custom), although as a master of illusion magic, she could simply change her appearance at will. She had green eyes, and a voluptuous build.
She stood at  and weighed .
She was known for her sharp wits and iron will. She was the most diplomatic among all of the tharchions and zulkirs, and her efforts to discourage feuds and to help settle disputes between them were said to have been the only reason that Thay had not descended into civil war in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As a powerful wizard She could also conjure a flying horse.
Dmitra dressed in ostentatious fashion, often wearing several layers of robes, and/or a robe of scintillating colors. She would laden herself with jewelry, particularly piercings and also necklaces, which she wore both around her neck and across her head like circlets. 
In battle, she wielded a staff and an ebon lash.
As the Tharchion of Eltabbar, Dmitra presided over the Thayan capital of Eltabbar as well as Lake Thaylambar and many of the fishing communities around it. She was known to delegate much of the day-to-day running of the tharch to her Autharches while she remained politically active by managing relationships with neighboring realms. Relative to other Thayan tharchions, she was said to have an almost "enlightened" style of rulership.
She owned a great many of the public spaces in the city of Eltabbar, as well as thousands of slaves.
Dmitra was involved in actively expanding Red Wizard power and trade outside of Thay. Hers was the largest and most effective network of spies in all of Thay, and were known to ruthlessly dispose of their enemies. Dmitra often did some spying herself, mostly in the guise of a pretty Rashemi young woman.
Prior to the Time of Troubles, she was thought to pay respect to Leira, the goddess of illusion.
Dmitra Flass had no allegiance to the Flass family, and she would frequently use different names as a result. This led to many simply referring to her as "The Tharchioness" within Thay or the "First Princess of Thay" beyond its borders, a title that her fellow Red Wizards found quite amusing.
She was married to the High Blade of Mulmaster, Selfaril Uoumdolphin&mdashwhich was actually his twin brother Rassendyll Uoumdolphin, who had imprisoned and impersonated Selfaril&mdashmaking her a princess and authority figure in Mulmaster. Her and Selfarils relationship was known to be marred by violent arguments, and she didnt spend much time in the company of her husband or in his city, preferring to visit Mulmaster only three times each year and using magic to make the trip quickly. Their political marriage greatly increased both her and the Red Wizards power within the Moonsea region. She maintained a large retinue at the Thayan enclave in Mulmaster&mdashled by Conjuremaster Ahryn Firefinger&mdashto promote the Red Wizards interests and to counter the influence of rivals like the Zhentarim. 
Dmitra recruited several servants from Mulmaster to serve her back in Eltabbar in the hopes that their lack of ties in Thay would make them less likely to betray her. One of her most trusted servants was Malark Springhill, whom she brought with her from Mulmaster to manage her network of spies.
The Red Wizard Rembert Wellford was a distant cousin to Dmitra.
Dmitra was born into the Thayan noble family of Flass in the . Following a major dispute, she severed ties with the family, and although the dispute itself was soon mostly forgotten, the grudge endured and the young Dmitra preferred to avoid using her real name.
By the 1350s DR, the young Dmitra was Tharchioness of Eltabbar, but her power in the city of Eltabbar itself was tentative. The large number of influential Red Wizards residing in the city meant that her authority&mdashas a relatively novice mage&mdashwas subject to their whims. In most cases, she simply retreated from governing the tharch and left it to her Autharches, who in turn spent much of their time pandering to meddling Red Wizards. she began a courtship with her future husband, Selfaril of Mulmaster, when she sent him a gold earing soaked in perfume and he in turn sent her a cloak of yeti fur. This exchange of gifts allowed the pair to begin meeting in person&mdashrather than just corresponding through proxies&mdashwithout fear of scandal, gossip, or the risk of offending Thayan custom.
Over the course of the 1360s DR, Dmitra expanded both her political and magical power significantly, establishing herself as an important figure and becoming a staunch ally to Szass Tam. she wielded direct control over her subjects while her Autharches managed menial tasks such as rebuilding her city. also helped to solidify her power as it granted her influence beyond Thays borders. Unbeknownst to her, Selfaril had actually been secretly usurped and replaced earlier that year by his twin brother, Rassendyll. Given that she only rarely visited her new husband, Dmitra continued to remain unaware that she had married a different man.
By the end of the decade, her spies were ruthlessly seeking out the agents of her and Tams rivals, and her rule over Eltabbar was rarely challenged by fellow Red Wizards. which ended up bringing her into conflict with everyone from the Brotherhood of the Cloak to the Strifelord of the Citadel of the Raven.
Early in the , Dmitra was with her husband in Mulmaster for a celebration of their wedding anniversary when they received a group of gemstone golems as a gift from the Thayan Ambassador Reyvan, but the constructs went rogue in an apparent assassination attempt. Both of them survived, but Dmitra immediately returned to Eltabbar. On Kythorn 3 of that same year, Dmitra was present alongside Szass Tam and other Red Wizards when the demon lord Eltab escaped his bonds. In the chaos, she suffered severe burns and blistering when her garments caught fire on a wayward torch and her many pieces of jewelry became super-heated. The flames were extinguished by Thazienne Uskevren, and her injuries were addressed by Tharchion Azhir Kren.
In the , when Szass Tam seized rulership of all Thay by force, Dmitras loyalty for the lich ended. She called for a secret meeting of all zulkirs who had once supported Tam and convinced them to raise their combined armies and wizards to oppose the lichs forces. The council achieved a great victory at the Keep of Thazar against an undead army led by Szass Tams necromancers. Szass responded by sending the combined forces of Gauros and Surthay, along with hordes of undead, south towards Bezantur. This enabled Dmitra to enlist the other opposing zulkirs&mdashNevron, Lauzoril, and Mythrellan&mdashto her council of resistance as well.
Following the demise of Mythrellan, the long-serving Zulkir of Illusion, Dmitra assumed her title.
During a decisive fight at the Keep of Sorrows in the , Szass almost succeeded in magically forcing Dmitra to fight for his cause, but his magic failed as the Spellplague hit and Dmitra was released from his hold. The war continued despite the crippling effects of the Spellplague on magic.
Dmitras spymaster, Malark Springhill, suddenly switched sides to fight for Szass Tams cause. During another battle at the Keep of Sorrows, Malark attempted to kill Dmitra with the intention to spare her from undeath.
According to history books a century later, and as Xenk Yendar would recall, in the mid-1370s DR, Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of the Thaymount tharch, Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on the eve of the summer solstice. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.Honor Among Thieves only says "the capital" of Thay, which at the time should be Eltabbar. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tams tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead.Honor Among Thieves mentions only the eve of the solstice due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god Amaunator has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lieâ€”instead, Szass interrupted Zulkir Dmitra Flass as she addressed the crowd and used the horn of beckoning death, thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and following conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain by Red Wizards in his service.It is difficult to reconcile Xenks account and the scenes in Honor Among Thieves with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tams betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in The Crimson Gold in 1373 DR the meeting of the Council of Zulkirs in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tams takeover of Thay in Unclean in 1375 DR and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenks childhood memories, its presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization. Nevertheless, it is presented here for completeness.
Dmitra was eventually replaced as Zulkir of Illusion by Hlarkus Baltreyo, a lich supporter of Tam.
