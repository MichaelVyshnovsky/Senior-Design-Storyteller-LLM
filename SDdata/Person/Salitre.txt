Salitre was a trap-making halfling imprisoned in Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR.
Salitre had short brown hair and pale skin. He wore a suit of leather armor, and habitually used a crossbow and traps.
He was rather paranoid and obsessed with his traps.
Salitre was condemned to Wheloon Prison for regular criminal activities, not Sharran worship. He lurked in the prison and built his traps, and resisted both the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon and the Cormyrean forces that fought for the prison.
