'''Hesketh Pratt''' was the owner of the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern in the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He had a face reminiscent of a smarmy [[rat]].

==Activities==
He was the owner, barkeeper, and sole worker in the tavern. He watered down his drinks.

==History==
Hesketh opened the Swamp Rat in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.<ref group="note">The tavern is said to be "recently opened" in ''Murder in Cormyr'', and was invented for the novel. Hence, no tavern of that name is mentioned in the description of Ghars in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'', published prior. While the novel is officially set in 1367 DR, the sourcebook is undated. For convenience, this article assumes the Swamp Rat was open in the same year. It immediately stole customers and business from the [[Bold Bard]], previously the only tavern in town, which angered its owner [[Shortshanks]]. However, the later ghost sightings around the Swamp Rat from [[Mirtul 27]] onward drove customers back to the Bold Bard.

Needless to say, Hesketh was eager for business by [[Eleint 17]], after the ghost was revealed to be a fake. That night, he served various customers, including [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], [[Bortas]], and others, and rented king's envoy [[Grodoveth]] a room.
