'''Irmar Graycloak''' was an [[adventurer]] and leader of the [[Graycloak's Wolves]] adventuring company in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Irmar Graycloak and Graycloak's Wolves were in the city of [[Hlondeth]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1343}}, when they were requested to deliver the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the most holy book of the [[church of Ilmater]]—to Master Sufferer [[Olbedan]] in [[Aralent]]. However, during the harsh winter, Graycloak's Wolves fell prey to [[doppelganger]]s and [[leucrotta]] preying on travelers. The [[tome]] was thought lost in the winter snows.
