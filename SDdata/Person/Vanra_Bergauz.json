        "mainbody": "'''Vanra Bergauz''' was the only daughter of [[Lora Bergauz]], a retired sailor and a patron of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|After all, it's not just me anymore. I'm - what is it they say? Eating for ''two.'' Vanra sits in my belly - growing fat with power. In time, I'll vomit her up and have myself a fresh young [[hag]] to train.|[[Auntie Ethel]]}}",
        "Description": "Vanra looked a lot like her mother. She was a [[human]] girl with freckled bronze skin, dark blue eyes, and red hair.",
        "Relationships": "Apart from her mother, Vanra had another family member â€“ uncle [[Tim Twofingers]]. Even if it was unclear if he was a biological uncle or Lora's friend, Tim adored young Vanra. He gifted her a copy of a [[book]] of adventures appropriately called ''[[Adventures on the Sea of Fallen Stars]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the time [[Captain Grisly]] was replaced by the [[green hag]] Auntie Ethel as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Vanra was seven years old. During one of her mother's boozy das, Vanra mysteriously disappeared. When Lora came to her senses, Vanra was missing, and everyone at the Mermaid seemed to believe that the girl never existed and Lora was there alone, meeting and drinking with friends. Distraught and desperate, Lora tried to find help, but no one believed her story. She eventually attempted to report the disappearance to [[Liara Portyr]] at the [[Basilisk Gate]] barracks. The [[Flaming Fist]] Blaze's investigation uncovered a lead. Still, when Lora arrived at the barracks, Liara Portyr seemed unable to focus on the problem and talked in circles, not willing nor able to comprehend the crime, as if some mind-magics afflicted her. She may have gotten lucky coming across the group called the [[Absolute Adversaries]], who offered to help the distraught mother.\n\nVanra was captured by Captain Grisly, or more precisely, Auntie Ethel. The hag consumed the child in a grim act of hag procreation. The heroes could've decided to save the child and, by using the ''[[hag's bane]]'' [[potion]], extracted the child alive and unharmed from the hag's belly. By other accords, Vanra was rescued, but the adventurers failed to save the child's life, breaking Lora's heart. And the last possibility was the \"heroes\" taking a grim or cruelly utilitarian approach and allowing the hag to gestate the child into a new hag in exchange for Auntie Ethel's help in defense of the Gate during the War with the [[Absolute]]."
