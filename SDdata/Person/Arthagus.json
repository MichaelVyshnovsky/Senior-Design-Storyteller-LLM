        "Description": "In [[1358 DR]], Arthagus was an elderly man with a white beard and green eyes.\n\nBy [[1373 DR]], Arthagus was a thin and trembling man.",
        "Personality": "Arthagus was a kind man, but he had been betrayed and threatened enough times that he firmly believed that lies and deception were necessary to survive life in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Activities": "Arthagus was a skilled [[illusionist]] and spent most of his time quietly in his Yhaunn home, refining his skill with the [[Art]] of illusion magic, and only occasionally tutoring young spellcasters interested in illusions. He was known to aid the rulers of [[Sembia]] by spreading false rumors that affected public opinion inside Sembia, or the impressions of foreign powers. This gained him quite a few friends on the [[Merchant's Council]].",
        "Possessions": "Arthagus owned many protective magic items including an ''[[Figurine of wondrous power|onyx dog]]''.",
        "History": "In 1373 DR, Arthagus briefly met the Moonmistress-Designate of [[Moonshadow Hall]] [[Feena Archwood]] at a high-society party hosted by [[Ammanas Aumleagarr]]."
