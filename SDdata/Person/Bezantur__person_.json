        "History": "Bezantur was the first high priest of Kossuth in the region of northern [[Mulhorand]] that would come to be known as Thay. He came to power sometime in or after the {{YearlinkName|-135}}, when a [[Kossuthan]] shrine was constructed in [[Kensten]] on the site that would become the [[Flaming Brazier]].\n\nAfter the Flaming Brazier's clergy aided the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]'s conquest of Kensten in the {{YearlinkName|932}}, one of the ways in which the Thayans honored their new allies was to rename the city in Bezantur's honor."
