A mighty magical throne was crafted for him, known as the Bloodbone Throne of Uruth.\nHis orcs instigated the Orcfastings War in 936 DR, and he led them to victory in the Battle of Whirling Blades, the Battle of Sarcrag and the Battle of Withered Fields. His long siege of Nimoars Hold was broken at the Battle of Burning Cliffs. Subsequently, Uruth was killed in the Battle of the Westwood. He was laid to rest in a crypt somewhere in the Sword Mountains, and it was rumored that he was buried alongside his spoils, including an artifact known as \"Galens Key\" said to be associated with the red dragon Karrnsyrrl."
