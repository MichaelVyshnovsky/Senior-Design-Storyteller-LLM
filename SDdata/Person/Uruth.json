        "Description": "Uruth was a massive tusker who was not too bright.",
        "History": "Uruth was an orc chieftain until [[927 DR]], when the shaman [[Wund]] crowned him king in an effort to unify the tribes of the Sword Mountains in the wake of the [[Blood Plagues]]. A mighty [[magical]] throne was crafted for him, known as the [[Bloodbone Throne of Uruth]].{{Cite dragon/351/Volo's Guide: Lost Regalia of the North: The Toppled Thrones|73}}\n\nHis orcs instigated the Orcfastings War in 936 DR, and he led them to victory in the [[Battle of Whirling Blades]], the [[Battle of Sarcrag]] and the [[Battle of Withered Fields]]. His long siege of Nimoar's Hold was broken at the [[Battle of Burning Cliffs]]. Subsequently, Uruth was killed in the [[Battle of the Westwood]]. He was laid to rest in a crypt somewhere in the Sword Mountains, and it was rumored that he was buried alongside his spoils, including an artifact known as \"[[Galen's Key]]\" said to be associated with the [[red dragon]] [[Karrnsyrrl]]."
