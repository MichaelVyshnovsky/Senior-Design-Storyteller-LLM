        "mainbody": "Leayonadas Ortauré was an elven inhabitant of Cormanthyr in the 3 century DR.\nOne of the conspirators against Coronal Eltargrim named him as amongst those slain by Elminster Aumar, and claimed to be their relative, almost certainly their parent.As the speaker is amongst Bellas, Maendellyn, Ortauré, Tassarion and Yeschant, a process of elimination leaves only Ortauré. It is unclear whether he perished during Elminsters hunt, or by Symrustars hand however, as he makes reference to a single dead, it is assumed for the purposes of this article that only one Ortauré heir died in the revel, almost certainly Leayonadas, and that he was slain prior to the Hunt. Elminster was informed prior that the Ortaure heir was slain by the pool, during his encounter with Symrustar Auglamyr, by an elf who held him responsible."
