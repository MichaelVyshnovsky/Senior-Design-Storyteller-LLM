He was a servant and ally of the Prince of Shade Rivalen Tanthul.\nIn his youth, Vees was sent to Waterdeep to avoid the dark influence of his family.\nHe went back to Selgaunt as a new man and priest of Siamorphe and soon became a key advisor of Thamalon Uskevren II during the start of his reign as hulorn. In the meantime, he ordered the construction of a new temple dedicated to Siamorphe, but in truth a temple to Shar. In the , after the start of the Sembian Civil War, Vees suggested Tamlin ask the Shadovar for assistance and an alliance against Mirabeta Selkirk, as Rivalen had ordered Vees to do.\nAfter the alliance between the Shadovar and Selgaunt was secure, Rivalen decided he no longer needed Vees, who was an unnecessary witness of his plots. So Rivalen revealed part of the truth to Tamlin, who accused Vees of being a traitor to Selgaunt. As a final step for his conversion to Shar, Tamlin killed Vees in cold blood. Publicly, it was announced that Vees had died during the Battle of Selgaunt."
