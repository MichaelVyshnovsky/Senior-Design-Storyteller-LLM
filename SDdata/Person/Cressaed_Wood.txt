'''Cressaed Wood''' was a [[Cormyr]]ian [[bard]] who wrote ''[[A Harper's Companion]]'', a series of three songbooks.

==History==
Cressaed lived around 1200 DR, as a [[bard]], but preferred music and teaching over adventuring. Once he had a name for himself, he founded a music and magic school in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], and his work, ''[[A Harper's Companion]]'', was his teaching tool for students. Cressaed preferred to teach smaller groups, and copied each volume by hand.

Upon graduation from his school, each student was presented with a copy of the first volume of ''A Harper's Companion'', and the other two were presented to students who showed increasing magical and musical skill.

Cressaed was found dead in his bed, a victim of poison, and there were suspicions that he was killed because he was believed to be a [[Harper]]. No Harper officially stated whether Cressaed was himself a Harper or not.
