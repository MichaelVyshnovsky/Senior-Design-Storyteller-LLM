She later served as a mistress of Arach-Tinilith, a position she held in 1484 DR. In this position, she handled administrative work under Mistress Quenthel Baenre and was served by Myrineyl Baenre.\nWhile serving Quenthel Baenre at Arach-Tinilith, Minolin developed an ally in Gromph Baenre, Quenthels brother. She became pregnant with his child in 1484 DR in the same year, the two were married. Their child was to be named Yvonnel and was expected to become the successor of Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre.\nMinolin served Quenthel Baenre, who viewed her as weak and a fool. However, Minolin developed a relationship with Gromph Baenre as her ally and advisor, a relationship Gromph intended to use to subvert his sisters power. Minolin in turn hoped to use Gromph to break the Academy free from the control of House Baenre."
