Necromharge was an enigmatic evil mage who terrorized the the North in 1358 DR.
Around 1358 DR, Necromharge was the leader of an army of organized bands of undead that ravaged major trade routes throughout the North. The undead within these bands included skeletons, spectres, wights, and zombies.
These undead would kill those that they encountered, then steal both their valuables and their bodies. The latter of course were used to swell their ranks. Eventually, the Lords Alliance put out a bounty on Necromharge. Their ultimate fate was unknown.
