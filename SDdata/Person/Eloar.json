        "Abilities": "During her fight with [[Taal]], Eloar made use of short-range teleportations, a blinding effect alongside her rapier attack, and even became ''invisible'' for a brief period.",
        "History": "At a point in time equivalent to the {{yearlinkName|1396}}, Eloar joined [[Dramvar]] in a trip to their neighboring spire, the [[Tower of Winter's Peace]], where they sought to talk to [[Malyanna]]. Her castellan, [[Taal]], informed them that her absence continued and that she was in the world rather than the [[Feywild]]; they invoked the [[Articles of the Compact]], requesting Taal provide access to her chambers, so that they may be examined for suspicious activity. Though Taal acquiesced, he ambushed and slew them shortly afterwards. He discarded their bodies over [[Forever's Edge]] later.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Taal replicated Dramvar's handwriting later, claiming that the two eladrin nobles he'd slain had decided to remain at Winter's Peace for a full tenday.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP|67-69|7}}"
