        "mainbody": "'''Shajji Hoijarek''' was a [[human]] [[barbarian]] of the [[Tsu-tsu]] tribe of the [[Plain of Horses]] in the late 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. A former [[lama]], he later became the ''qaghan'' or leader of the tribe and the city of [[Jugicha]].",
        "History": "Hoijarek was originally a lama at the temples in Jugicha. However, at the age of 50, he left his temple to serve as ''apa qaghan'' under his brother, [[Shajji Ghoiji]], who at the time ruled the Tsu-tsu as ''qaghan''.\n\nHowever, Ghoiji's government was corrupt and fell into chaos and finally rebellion ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2587|SY}}. Thus Hoijarek stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and ascending as the new ''qaghan''.\n\nFor the next 20 years, Hoijarek ruled well and worked to reestablish order in Jugicha and revive Tsu-tsu prosperity. Yet he also conquered a number of lesser neighboring tribes by slaying their livestock and poisoning their water supplies to force them to submit to the Tsu-tsu. He opposed the [[Fankiang]] tribe and the rulers of [[Li-Raz]] as a means of uniting his people. However, during a raid, the Fankiang killed his wife and children. Hoijarek made a vow of vengeance, and all the Tsu-tsu swore with him.\n\nHoijarek remained in power, but knew he had only a few years remaining to witness the fall of the Fankiang before his old body succumbed to age.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Hoijarek hatched a scheme to lure the Fankiang into a trap. He ordered forty [[camel]]s be stained white,",
        "Description": "As an old man of more than 70 years of age, Hoijarek had a hard time breathing and his body moved stiffly."
