An unnamed servant attended the ultroloth Maram il Vass in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
The long years of servitude had completely conditioned him into unquestioningly serving the yugoloth. He had even lost his name.
Circa 1486 DR, the servant welcomed the guests of his master at the door of his lair.
