'''Lilith Lurraxol''' was a noblewoman of [[Lurraxol|House Lurraxol]] who lived in [[Trademeet]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Lilith was the favored grandchild of the Lurraxol matriarch, [[Ximora Lurraxol|Lady Ximora]]. Her grandmother served as a mentor of sorts.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Lady Lilith became involved in a fierce competition with [[Skarmaen Alibakkar]] over the ''[[Mantle of Waukeen]]''. She sought the relic to prove that her ancestors founded the city of Trademeet so many years before.

A couple years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Lady Ximora sought to reopen trade between Trademeet and the rebellious city of [[Riatavin]]. To this end she had Lilith attempt to convince [[Logan Coprith|High Merchant Logan Coprith]] to reopen the trade route, albeit unsuccessfully.
