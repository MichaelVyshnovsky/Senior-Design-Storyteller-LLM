        "mainbody": "The '''Nameless One''' was a nameless [[human]] of the [[planes]] with a unique form of immortality.",
        "Description": "Rather than being protected from injury, he had regeneration abilities, like a [[troll]]. His specific brand of unending life given to him by the [[night hag]] Ravel allowed him to always rise from the dead after a certain period of time. However, with each rising, he lost large chunks of his memory, leaving him little clue as to what he was doing or even where he was.\n\nTo counter this disorientation, one of the Nameless One's \"incarnations\" had important facts tattooed on his back in large runes. These became hard to read, however, as the other side-effect of his immortality was to always bear the scars of combat. In time, the Nameless One was heavily scarred, a testament to how many times he had \"died.\"",
        "History": "Once, a warrior named [[Vhailor]] aided the Nameless One but was destroyed in the attempt. A [[githzerai]] called [[Dak'kon]] also worked for the Nameless One, but was slain by a powerful entity. Both ''[[Vhailor's helm]]'' and ''[[Dak'kon's Zerth blade]]'' found their way to [[Toril]] and into the possession of [[Deidre]] of [[Aurora's Emporium]]. She offered them for sale at the Adventurer Mart at [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in [[Athkatla]] in [[1368 DR]].<ref>"
