        "mainbody": "he Nameless One was a nameless human of the planes with a unique form of immortality.\nRather than being protected from injury, he had regeneration abilities, like a troll. His specific brand of unending life given to him by the night hag Ravel allowed him to always rise from the dead after a certain period of time. However, with each rising, he lost large chunks of his memory, leaving him little clue as to what he was doing or even where he was.\nTo counter this disorientation, one of the Nameless Ones \"incarnations\" had important facts tattooed on his back in large runes. These became hard to read, however, as the other side-effect of his immortality was to always bear the scars of combat. In time, the Nameless One was heavily scarred, a testament to how many times he had \"died.\"\nOnce, a warrior named Vhailor aided the Nameless One but was destroyed in the attempt. A githzerai called Dakkon also worked for the Nameless One, but was slain by a powerful entity. Both Vhailors helm and Dakkons Zerth blade found their way to Toril and into the possession of Deidre of Auroras Emporium. She offered them for sale at the Adventurer Mart at Waukeens Promenade in Athkatla in 1368 DR."
