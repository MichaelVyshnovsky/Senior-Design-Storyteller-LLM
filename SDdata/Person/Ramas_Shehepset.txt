Ramas Shehepset was a Mulan tavern owner inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Ramas owned the Angry Coxswain tavern located in the central section Waterdeeps Dock Ward along the waterfront where Odd Street joined Dock Street. He was secretly a slaver who worked with his brewer, Orth Ironchisel, to magically transport victims to Mulhorand via a portal found within the tavern. Ramas would employ Drejjd from the Unseen so that it would appear the victims had not disappeared.
