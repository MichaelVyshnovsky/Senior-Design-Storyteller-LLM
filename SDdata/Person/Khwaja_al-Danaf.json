        "mainbody": "'''Khwaja al-Danaf''' was the head of the [[House of Al-Danafi]] merchant family in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]], though he was more of a figurehead because his wife, [[Perijan al-Danaf|Perijan]] was the real reason for their success.{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|44-45}}",
        "Description": "Khwaja was a middle-aged man who dressed in fine cloth often sewn with pearls.",
        "Activities": "The patriarch busied himself with expanding his empire and finding new seaborne trade routes, especially to the countries found north of [[Zakhara]].",
        "History": "Khwaja began his career in trade with a failed business in [[Gana]]. A dream revealed him traveling to [[Jumlat]] and discovering a horde of wealth, so he promptly sailed to the distant city.\n\nUpon his arrival he overheard a pair of ''[[sa'luk]]s'' planning to rob a wealthy merchant's home. Trusting in [[Fate]], Khwaja decided to join the thieves. He fell and broke his leg while scaling the outer wall to the merchant's home. His screams from the pain alerted the household and his companions abandoned him to his fate.\n\nWhen taken before a ''[[Midani dictionary|qadi]]'' for judgment, Khwaja was granted leniency after relating his story of his dream. The ''qadi'' laughed at his story but related one of his own dreams regarding a chest of gold buried near a fountain decorated with [[griffon]]s. Khwaja's home in Gana had a fountain that matched this description, so when his leg was healed he traveled back home and happened to find a large chest of gold buried under the fountain.\n\nPerijan helped Khwaja invest their newfound fortune, eventually creating a large trading empire for the family.",
        "Relationships": "[[Tanya bint Perijan|Tanya]] was Khwaja's daughter."
