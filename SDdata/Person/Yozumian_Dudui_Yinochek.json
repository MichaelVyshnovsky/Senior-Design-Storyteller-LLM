        "mainbody": "ozumian Dudui Yinochek was the high priest of the Protectors House, a Sel√ªnian temple in Memnon. \nOn the surface Yozumians clerics helped the poor people of Memnon, but in truth the high members of the church, starting with Yozumian, were corrupt, living in very comfortable room with precious goods and indulging in the company of women.\nYozumian especially enjoyed the company of women, sometimes pretending to perform special rituals on them.\nOne of his victims was the young mother of young Artemis Entreri who was subservient to Yozumian even before Entreris birth. In 1368 Entreri remembered that part of his past and returned to Memnon to confront his family and Yozumian.\nYozumian used all his resources to avoid a confrontation with the assassin, but Entreri, aided by Jarlaxle, defeated the Protectors Houses defense and confronted Yozumian. He denied mistreating Enteris mother, murmuring about gods designs. Entreri rebuffed this claim and killed the man."
