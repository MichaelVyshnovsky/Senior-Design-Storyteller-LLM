'''Ren o' the Star''', or '''Ren'''<ref group="note">Ren o' the Star may be the same person as [[Ren o' the Blade]]. They were both created by [[James Ward]], and had the same characteristics, and existed in the same point in time at seemingly the right age. As Ren went by many different aliases throughout his life, this article features his exploits in the ''Forgotten Realms'' as Ren o' the Star., was a [[human]] adventurer and [[thief]] who worked for the [[Rogue's Guild]] of [[Hillsfar]].

==Description==
{{quote
|Trouble, mighty lord, I wouldn't dream of it.
|Ren to a [[Red Plume]]
}}
Ren was a tall man, measuring "a head taller than six feet", and was a proficient rogue. The lad used profanity often, as well as cursing the world and its [[god]]s. He had a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, as was known to be referred to as a "joker".

His speciality was in picking locks, and would prefer to do this than pickpocket others.

==Possessions==
The talented thief owned several [[throwing knife|throwing knives]], a pair of [[short sword]]s, a sack of [[caltrop]]s, a ''[[scroll]] of [[teleport]]'', and a ''[[potion of giant strength]]''.

==History==
===To Hillsfar===
In [[1358 DR]], Ren traveled to the [[Moonsea]] region. He had come into much trouble, such as being pursued by [[Cormyrian]]s, evicted from [[Waterdeep]], and even had his prized [[horse]] slain. After contemplation, Ren o' the Star decided the next settlement he arrived at would be one where he would abide by the rules. That place would be Hillsfar.

Upon entry of Hillsfar, the [[Red Plumes]] under order of King [[Maalthiir]], confiscated his magical and potentially dangerous wares, as they did for all citizens. Ren was then allowed entry, and noted the marks of a guild of thieves. Following the marks, he made his way to the Rogue's Guild of Hillsfar.

===Rogue's Guild Initiate===
In the guild, Ren met with the guild master, [[Swipe]], who sent him on a quest of acquiring a rare [[fungus]]. After a confrontation with the local [[magic]] store's owner, he was directed to [[Hillsfar/Sewers|the sewers]]. Descending into the sewers, the young rogue found a metal-bound chest, and found the fungus growing underneath it. After returning to the guild and completing this first task, Ren was accepted as an official member of the guild.

Later, Swipe believed Ren was ready for his next task. The towering guild leader sent him to purloin a collection of [[potion]]s, believed to be outside the city, in [[Hermit's Place]]. After stealing a horse to replace his deceased prized mare, he rode on to his destination. Making his way into and through the maze-like building, Ren found a chest, but accidentally activated its trap mechanism, releasing sleeping gas.

Ren awoke from his induced slumber, and hacked away at the chest, and miraculously, it broke open. After bolting out of the place, he returned one of the rare potions to Swipe, who rewarded him with 1250 [[gp]]. However, the opportunistic Ren kept the others, wanting to search for the highest bidder of such rarities.
