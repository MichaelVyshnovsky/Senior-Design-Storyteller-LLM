Thel Dendrar was a woodcarver that lived in Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.
He was a courageous man, and the only resident of Phandalin to stand up to the Redbrands.
Thel was the patriarch of the Dendrar family. He had a wife, Mirna, and two children, Nars and Nilsa.
His woodworking shop was located in central Phandalin.
Circa 1491 DR, the local bandits of Phandalin gave sly and suggestive looks to Mirna, Thels wife. The Redbrands had been terrorizing the village for some time, and the townmaster, Harbin Wester, was too intimidated to do anything. Thus, Thel approached the bandits alone in this cause. This did not go well, and he was murdered.
Thels corpse and his family were taken to Tresendar Manor, the ruffians base. Thel was thrown into the caverns beneath the manor and fed to a nothic, whilst his family were put into a slave pen.
