At last, he challenged Josidiah at an Honor Duel but when Paeris tried to wield the Artblade the sword judged him unworthy.\nUsing some mysterious rituals the Elder and the baelnorns of Haladar clan managed to restore the magic abilities of Paeris after 30 years.\nHe fought during the Weeping War and in a decisive battle in Ches 3â€“5 of 712 DR at Dlabraddath, against his superiors orders, Paeris led four companies of AkhFaer and AkhVelahr to attack the Army of Darkness, believing he could end the war with a decisive victory.
