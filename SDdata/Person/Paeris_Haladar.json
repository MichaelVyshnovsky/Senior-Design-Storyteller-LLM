        "History": "In [[667 DR]], Paeris was chosen as Spell-Major and one of the members of the early [[Council of Twelve]].\n\nIn [[670 DR]], Paeris discovered someone had raided the [[Vault of the Ages]].\n\nIn [[689 DR]], after losing his position as Spell-Major to [[Josidiah Starym]], Paeris tried four times to assassinate him. At last, he challenged Josidiah at an Honor Duel but when Paeris tried to wield the [[Artblade]] the sword judged him unworthy.\n\nUsing some mysterious rituals the Elder and the [[baelnorn]]s of [[Haladar]] clan managed to restore the magic abilities of Paeris after 30 years.\n\nHe fought during the Weeping War and in a decisive battle in [[Ches 3]]â€“[[Ches 5|5]] of [[712 DR]] at [[Dlabraddath]], against his superiors' orders, Paeris led four companies of Akh'Faer and [[Akh'Velahr]] to attack the [[Army of Darkness]], believing he could end the war with a decisive victory. Instead, they found a trap and were all killed, including Paeris. However, the Army also suffered a great loss.",
        "Possessions": "Paeris wielded one of the [[Baneblades of Demron]], [[Faervian]], until tried to kill Josidiah and the Artblade rejected him. Afterward, the sword was ceded to [[Phyrra Iliathorr]]."
