        "mainbody": "Lemmeth was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nHe could cast at least one spell of holding, which worked on doppelgangers, and one spell that created a moonglow capable of revealing shapeshifting creatures.\nHe was recruited by Eskrel Starbridge, the highest highknight in Cormyr at the time, to join him in a search for the fugitive Elminster Aumar in Shadowdale.\nLemmeth was a part of Eskrel Starbridges forces when seeking Elminster in Shadowdale in the . During the search, Lemmeth managed to hold Thal, a doppelganger and accomplice of another doppelganger pretending to be Elminster, for questioning. The same force found Storm Silverhand masquerading as Elminster Aumar fearing another doppelganger, he employed a moonglow to suss her out. After proving she was not a shapeshifter, Lemmeth left the talking to Eskrel, who was outplayed completely by Storm.\nHe was later somewhat suspicious of Eskrel because of this."
