General Raachaak was a power-hungry balor who sought to capture a legendary bloodforge in the 14 century DR.
Towering General Raachaak appeared similar to other balors. He had huge bony wings, massive musculature, jagged claws, amber-colored eyes, and oily thick leathery crimson skin. His weapon of choice was his demonic serpentine whip of many tails, speckled with obsidian shards.
Raachaak was evil and sadistic, and like the rest of his kin, ambitious. He resented most creatures and would retaliate with extreme cruelty for the mere act of questioning him.
In 1371 DR, the vrocks Morbaat, Shaakat, and Rejik were ordered by General Raachaak to find a way into the ancient and recently resettled city in the Utter East that contained a fabled bloodforge. When the general gave his subservient vrocks instructions to head to Toril, Morbaat stood out of line and asked Raachaak if the vrocks would be better off capturing the bloodforge instead of simply scouting the way into the city. In punishment, the vrock was stomped into the ground by the general and slashed with his fiery whip until she stopped screaming and ceased convulsing in agony.
Rachaak planned on using the power of the bloodforge to conjure countless warriors out of thin air and overrun Baator. But in order to do so, he needed his servants to find a way around the new denizens wards against all tanarri.
Even though Shaakat and Rejik indeed found a way into the cityâ€”a portal that lay in the Sargauth Level of Undermountain, the tanarris ambition and greed led to the vrocks confrontation with the paladins of Tyr trying to reach the same portal. The vrocks failed miserably, as the confrontation led to the portal being buried under the collapsed tunnel. General Rachaak did not abandon his quest for power, however, and tortured the vrocks in punishment.
