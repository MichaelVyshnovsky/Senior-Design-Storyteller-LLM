Old Goatbeard was the skilled yak-folk governor of the Red Goat province in the World Pillar Mountains in 1367 DR.
Old Goatbeard was a member of the Seven Sages and the appointed governor of the Red Goat province within the Yikarian Empire. He was well known for his collection of courtesans, all of whom lived within his small but splendid palace on the shores of the Lake of the Emerald Eye.
In addition to being a powerful wizard and priest of the Faceless God, Old Goatbeard was a master shapeshifter who used this ability to develop rogue-like skills.
Discrete circles of yikarians were aware that Old Goatbeard smuggled goods through the Blackwash Fens near Lipo.
