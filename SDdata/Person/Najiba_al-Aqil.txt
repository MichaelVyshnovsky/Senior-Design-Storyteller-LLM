Najiba al-Aqil was a court official in Medina al-Afyal in 1367 DR.
Najiba seemed quite sane and reasonable, especially when surrounded by the other eccentric figures of the court of Medina al-Afyal.
Najiba represented the interests of the various merchant houses of the city. This was an honorable position given the importance of the merchant houses in bringing both supplies and civilization from the rest of Zakhara into the city.
