Kishimoto Endai was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan and jito of Kan-oji in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In Kan-oji, he led a company of three samurai and ten bushi. He was at the time busy with emergencies. An infestation of evil hengeyokai, goblins, and bakemono plagued the village. Kishimoto had begun to be suspicious about it.
Kishimoto was not a good administrator and was not loved by the yakusho.
