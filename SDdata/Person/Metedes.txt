'''Metedes''' was a [[priest]] of [[Helm]] and member of Sir [[Justin Melenikus]]'s watchers at [[Iniarv's Tower]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Metedes and his fellow watchers were from the city of [[Waterdeep]]. Their services and ventures into the [[Mere of Dead Men]] were encouraged via writs that could be changed for [[coin]] back in the City of Splendors.
