'''Quelsandas''' was a mature adult [[bronze dragon]] allied with [[Impiltur]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In 1373 DR, following the suggestion of the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]], Queen [[Sambryl]] of Impiltur agreed to send a small contingent to the [[Gray Forest]] to destroy a [[Cult of the Dragon]] hideout. Among the expedition force there were  also six [[bronze dragon]]s, one being Quelsandas.

However, Quelsandas had previously made an agreement with [[Sammaster]] to betray his [[human]] allies in exchange for being spared from the effects of the Rage. Thus, at the chosen time, just before ambushing the cultist army, he surprised and turned on the Impilturan troops, casting a spell to drive the other bronze dragons into a frenzy. Unfortunately, Quelsandas found himself betrayed as well; though promised immunity, he cried out in despair as he, too, was afflicted. Taegan and the [[paladin]] lord [[Rangrim]] managed to kill the traitorous bronze, but the paladin died in the fight.
