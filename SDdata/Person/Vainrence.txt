Vainrence was the second-in-command of the War Wizards of Cormyr in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, Vainrence, together with the Royal Mage Ganrahast Aeiulvana, was imprisoned by one of Manshoons servants in magical stasis in a crypt beneath the Royal Palace in Suzail. Elminster and Vangerdahasts shade rescued Vainrence and Ganrahast.
Later, he and Glathra Barcantle explored the crypt.
