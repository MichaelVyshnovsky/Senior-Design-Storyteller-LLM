}}'''Vaeristhelph Rex''' was one of the seven [[lich]]es who created [[Crenshinibon]], and was later consumed by it.

==History==
Rex rose to power as the [[wizard]]-emperor of a world beyond [[Toril]]. He chose to sacrifice his position for lichdom. Some time after this, he fell into a state of madness.
