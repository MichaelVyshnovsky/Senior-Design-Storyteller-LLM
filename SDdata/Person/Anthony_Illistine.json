        "mainbody": "Anthony Illistine was the governor of Chondath during the midâ€“2 century DR and member of the famed Illistine family. Following his acclaimed victory in the Battle of the Elven Tears, he united the collective city-states of Arrabar, Mussum, Samra, and Shamph under one rule.\nBy the year 143 DR, Lord Illistine had come to some significant level of power in the region that would be known as Chondath. During that year, when human loggers\nwere stopped from making further forays into the Chondalwood by the forests wild elves, Illistine saw an opportunity. He united the cities of Arrabar, Mussum, Samra and Shamph in an alliance, and in the winter of 143 DR, sacked the elven city of Ariel-than in what would come to be known as the Battle of Elven Tears.\nSecuring the source of logging for the region, Lord Illistine extended his power over the region. In 144 DR, some six months after the battle with the elves, Lord Illistine had ascended to the position of governor of the city-states of Chondath."
