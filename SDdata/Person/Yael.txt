'''Yael''' ({{Pronounce|YAY|el|refs=}}) was a general in the [[Hellriders]] of [[Elturel]] who became trapped in [[Avernus]] following [[Zariel]]'s failed invasion of the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1354}},{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|16}} the rogue [[angel]] Zariel enlisted the aid of the Hellriders to mount an assault on Avernus itself in an attempt to end the [[Blood War]] between [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s. Yael was one of the three Hellrider generals participating in the assault, along with [[Olanthius]] and [[Haruman]].

When it became clear the Hellriders had lost the day in a most disastrous fashion, Zariel instead swore her fealty to [[Asmodeus]] in exchange for infernal legions she could use to prosecute the Blood War. Upon witnessing this betrayal, Yael and [[Lulu]], Zariel's [[hollyphant]] companion, stole the ''[[Sword of Zariel]]'' and fled, hoping it could be used to redeem the fallen angel one day. Fleeing, Yael and Lulu fought through a horde of demons under the command of [[Yeenoghu]], but were able to escape&mdash;barely. The [[demon lord]] sent his pet, the horrifying [[Crokek'toeck]], to chase after the pair. Just as Yeenoghu's pet was about to devour them, Yael plunged the ''Sword of Zariel'' into a stone while Lulu channeled all the holy power she could muster into it. A mighty fortress sprang into existence around the sword, shielding it from all evil: the [[Bleeding Citadel]]. Exhausted from the effort, Lulu fled, leaving Yael behind.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Yael's [[ghost]] still guarded the Bleeding Citadel and the ''Sword of Zariel'' within.

==Relationships==
Yael was considered Zariel's most loyal general.
