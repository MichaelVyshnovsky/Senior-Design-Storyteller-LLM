Yael () was a general in the Hellriders of Elturel who became trapped in Avernus following Zariels failed invasion of the Nine Hells.
In the , the rogue angel Zariel enlisted the aid of the Hellriders to mount an assault on Avernus itself in an attempt to end the Blood War between demons and devils. Yael was one of the three Hellrider generals participating in the assault, along with Olanthius and Haruman.
When it became clear the Hellriders had lost the day in a most disastrous fashion, Zariel instead swore her fealty to Asmodeus in exchange for infernal legions she could use to prosecute the Blood War. Upon witnessing this betrayal, Yael and Lulu, Zariels hollyphant companion, stole the Sword of Zariel and fled, hoping it could be used to redeem the fallen angel one day. Fleeing, Yael and Lulu fought through a horde of demons under the command of Yeenoghu, but were able to escape&mdashbarely. The demon lord sent his pet, the horrifying Crokektoeck, to chase after the pair. Just as Yeenoghus pet was about to devour them, Yael plunged the Sword of Zariel into a stone while Lulu channeled all the holy power she could muster into it. A mighty fortress sprang into existence around the sword, shielding it from all evil the Bleeding Citadel. Exhausted from the effort, Lulu fled, leaving Yael behind.
As of the , Yaels ghost still guarded the Bleeding Citadel and the Sword of Zariel within.
Yael was considered Zariels most loyal general.
