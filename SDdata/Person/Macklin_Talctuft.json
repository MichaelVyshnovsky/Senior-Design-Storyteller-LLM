        "mainbody": "Macklin Talctuft was a dwarf who settled in Phandalin during the late 15 century DR.\nThey had a beard and a mohawk-style hair cut.\nMacklin had a general disinterest in tradition. They also abhorred doing anything that they found boring, and sought out work opportunities that would engage their creativity. Once they found such an opportunity, they were reliable and enthusiastic as they tackled their duties. However, they also had perfectionist tendencies, which could irritate coworkers or subordinates who found them to be impossible to please.\nMacklin was a wanderer who performed odd jobs around Phandalin, but was content to remain unemployed when they found such work too boring.\nWhile still young by dwarven standards, Macklin arrived in Phandalin sometime after its resettlement in the late 15 century DR looking for work in the mines. When they discovered that there was little mining to be done, they turned to odd jobs before electing to live off their savings while looking for work that would inspire them.\nBy the , they planned to join the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose, a franchise of Acquisitions Incorporated that had recently arrived in Phandalin, however this plan was derailed when the Fellowship was mysteriously wiped out by an explosion that also badly damaged the ruins of Tresendar Manor. The prospect of rebuilding the Manor soon captured Macklins imagination, leading them to offer their services to oversee a reconstruction project."
