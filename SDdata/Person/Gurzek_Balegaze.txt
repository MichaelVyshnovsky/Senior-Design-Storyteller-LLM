'''Gurzek Balegaze''' was a particularly friendly [[imp]] from the [[Nine Hells]] that dwelled within [[Helm's Hold]] during the city's occupation by the [[Ashmadai]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
{{Quote|You have questions about our magicians? I am no magician. Where I come from power is abundant, but tightly controlled.}}
Gurzek was quite knowledgeable about the function of [[arcane magic]] in the Realms following the [[Spellplague]], specifically how it was wielded by [[fiend]]s of the [[lower planes]] and the [[warlock]]s with which they made their infernal pacts. Gurzek believed these powers were ill-suited for solitary spellcasters and more beneficial for cults and other sects of like-minded individuals of middling power.

Gurzek had quite a critical eye for examining infernal contracts.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], Gurzek on a whim worked with an [[adventurer|adventuring]] [[wizard]] to education them about infernal contracts and the powers that [[hellfire warlock]]s could wield. Gurzek took a personal if fleeting interest in the wizard, and used the occasion to practice the [[common]] tongue and enjoy a bit of entertainment with a mortal.

Gurzek's stay on the [[prime Material plane]] was brief, as he had to return to work after a "week's time" on [[Toril]].
