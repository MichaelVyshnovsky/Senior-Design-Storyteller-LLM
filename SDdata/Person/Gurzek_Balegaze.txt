Gurzek Balegaze was a particularly friendly imp from the Nine Hells that dwelled within Helms Hold during the citys occupation by the Ashmadai in the late 15 century DR.
Gurzek was quite knowledgeable about the function of arcane magic in the Realms following the Spellplague, specifically how it was wielded by fiends of the lower planes and the warlocks with which they made their infernal pacts. Gurzek believed these powers were ill-suited for solitary spellcasters and more beneficial for cults and other sects of like-minded individuals of middling power.
Gurzek had quite a critical eye for examining infernal contracts.
In the , during the Siege of Helms Hold, Gurzek on a whim worked with an adventuring wizard to education them about infernal contracts and the powers that hellfire warlocks could wield. Gurzek took a personal if fleeting interest in the wizard, and used the occasion to practice the common tongue and enjoy a bit of entertainment with a mortal.
Gurzeks stay on the prime Material plane was brief, as he had to return to work after a "weeks time" on Toril.
