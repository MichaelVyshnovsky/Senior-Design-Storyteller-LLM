Willing Hand of the Lady '''Khonduil Ammargath''' was a [[thief]] turned [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]], a former [[adventurer]], and the Keeper of the shrine of Tymora in the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|24}}{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}}

==History==
In his younger days, Khonduil attached himself to the effort{{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|16-17}}<ref group="note">It is unknown when these events occur, but given that Khonduil is still alive as of the late 1350s DR, it is presumed to be within his lifetime and thus somewhere in the late 13{{th}} to early 14{{th}} centuries DR. Khonduil followed close behind Gathen, going unseen thanks to a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''. It would save his life too. In an upper level, Gathen encountered a [[gargoyle]]-like guardian monster that proceeded to rip his arms and legs off. Khonduil used the distraction to creep by and he claimed a wizard's staff and a [[wand]]. As the guardian finished with Gathen and began to hunt for new prey, Khonduil pointed the wand and spoke the [[command word]] conveniently inscribed on its handle. The guardian enlarged and changed, transforming into a mighty [[dragon]] so massive the tower exploded around it, causing stones to rain down around the site at the start of dusk of that day. With a triumphant roar, the dragon spread wings as wide as the tower was high, and flew off to the north as the tower collapsed. Witnesses disagreed on its kind, on whether its scales were [[brass dragon|brassy]], or [[green dragon|green]], or [[white dragon|white]], or even like [[electrum]]. Whatever it was, Khonduil would believe it to be the thing's true form.

Soon after the collapse, the Mulmasterite laborers began to turn over the stones, but when they heard digging noises coming from underground, noises that gradually got louder, most of them lost what was left of their nerves and fled. The remainder started to excavate and discovered a deep shaft; finding it held water, they decided it was simply a well.It's unclear when this occurred, but it's possible that Khonduil was the one digging his way out of the rubble.

Heading west, Khonduil operated as an acrobatic thief in the [[Western Heartlands]], in the cities of [[Iriaebor]] and [[Scornubel]] and beyond. But a terrible misfortune brought his thieving career to a sudden close. In Iriaebor, City of a Thousand Spires, Khonduil was making his escape from a theft by climbing hand-over-hand across a [[rope]] strung between two towers in its wealthiest district, with a heavy bag of [[coin]]s slung over his back. But a guard spotted him and fired a [[crossbow]], with the bolt going through Khonduil's forearm and breaking the bone. Losing his grip, Khonduil had a long drop down into a courtyard; his leg broke his fall, and the bag of coins broke his leg. Badly injured, Khonduil abandoned the loot and desperately crawled and dragged himself away from the scene, lest he be captured and killed. He escaped into a nearby canal, and had to swim to safety, ignoring the agony.

Afterward, Khonduil had little time to rest and heal properly, leaving his leg badly twisted. Crippled by his injuries, Khonduil could no longer work as a thief, at least not one of his talents. Thus, he headed back to Maskyr's Eye and became a priest and Keeper of the shrine, devoting himself to Tymora, the goddess of luck, after it seemed his had run out.

Once, when bandits tried to rob the shrine, Khonduil defended it with an unexpected ''[[fireball]]''.

==Description==
Once quite athletic, Khonduil's injury left his right leg twisted and forced him to use a [[staff]] to hobble around in his well-worn and floppy boots. In old age, he was frail and had a beard.

==Personality==
Even in his twilight years, he remained lively and of good nature. He made jokes and enjoyed stories of adventure.

==Abilities==
As well as being a cleric, Khonduil was known by the folk of Maskyr's Eye to possess magical powers of some kind, after the incident with the ''fireball'', but none knew the source.

==Home==
The shrine of Tymora stood atop a wooded knoll rising beside the road little to the north of the vale. Behind it stood a hard-packed dirt-floored one-room hut that served as the Keeper's home.

==Possessions==
He lived a rather frugal existence—as well as spare [[robe]]s, his hut furnished was with only a cot, a wooden bowl, a large covered water bowl, and [[strongbox]] holding [[bread]] and [[cheese]]. He also had an [[iron]] [[coffer]] in which went the offerings to Tymora; a typical amount was 26 [[gold piece]]s, 12 [[silver piece]]s, and 10 [[copper piece]]s. Of this, he took just enough for food, and left the rest to be collected by a priest from the [[Gate of Good Fortune]] temple in Mulmaster, [[Dzurdan Crommarch]], every two [[tenday]]s.

Yet the ex-thief had some treasures stashed away quite securely. Buried under the dirt floor he had a [[lead]]-lined [[coffin]], which held 300 [[gp]] in three bags and a small coffer containing twelve [[ruby|rubies]] each valued at an amazing 5,000 gp, and no less than the wizard's staff of Maskyr won all those years ago.

This was a ''[[staff of power]]'' with but eleven charges remaining. Although not a wizard, Khonduil used a little-known and little-understood technique to magically link himself to it, in a process familiar to just a few knowledgeable priests, mages, and sages. It had required a few drops of his blood and a matched pair of enchanted cords, with one tied around the staff and the other around his right ankle, where it was concealed under this boot; removing either cord would break the link and cause both to disintegrate. By this means, Khonduil could wield some of the buried staff's powers just like a wizard would with it in hand, without [[command word]]s or [[somatic component]]s, every couple of minutes. He could cast its [[spell]]s, using up its charges as normal, but could not use its smiting or retributive strike powers.

The existence of the staff was a secret to all, even the Maskyrians who'd seen him fling a ''fireball'', but the rogue wizard [[Ssuntyr]] suspected Khonduil knew of or was linked to Maskyr's magic.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|26}} Nevertheless, Khonduil would give the staff to anyone who could fully heal his injuries, but would not say where it was nor how he'd obtained until after the healing was done.

==Activities==
As the Keeper, Khonduil tended to the shrine and provided healing to the villagers, as well as to adventurers active in the area. Somehow, he always just happened to be there with whatever was needed, whether it was a healing spell, [[rope]] up to several hundred feet in length, or a [[horse]] with a litter on which to carry a stricken soul home.

With travelers, itinerant minstrels, and other Maskyrians, Khonduil spoke often of the legends of Maskyr One-Eye, his tower, and his rumored treasure. This was done in the name of Tymora, patron of adventurers, but also because he still wanted to know the truth of the tower, even many years later, and just didn't want to risk his life again. However, he took pains never to reveal that he had once been a thief, nor that he'd been in Maskyr's Tower when it fell. He believed most of Maskyr's purported treasure was yet to be discovered, and that reports of a silvery doorway high in the air after his fall were true.
