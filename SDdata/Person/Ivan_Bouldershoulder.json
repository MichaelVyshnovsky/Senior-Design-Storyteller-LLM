        "mainbody": "'''Ivan Bouldershoulder''' was a [[dwarf]] adventurer of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and brother to [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]].",
        "Description": "Ivan had a long yellow beard, square shoulders, and dark eyes. He had a long, wide nose.",
        "History": "Ivan and his brother Pikel were born and raised in [[Vaasa]], in the rugged [[Galena Mountains]]. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Ivan and Pikel fought alongside the [[elves]] of [[Shilmista]] against invading [[orcs]] and [[goblins]].<ref>\n\nLater, they resided at [[Spirit Soaring]], a temple to [[Deneir]] in the [[Snowflake Mountains]], with [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] and his wife [[Danica]].\n\nIvan and Pikel set out from [[Carradoon]] to attend the coronation of King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] in [[Mithral Hall]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Ivan's mind was taken over by the [[dracolich]] [[Yharaskrik]]. Ivan later regained control of his body and escaped into the tunnels of the mountains.\n\nIvan and Pikel later returned to the [[Bloodstone Lands]] together, this time to [[Helgabal]] in [[Damara]], where he served as a guard commander and master-at-arms in the Damaran army by [[1484 DR]], repeatedly proving himself as one of the best warriors in the city, but finding many of his duties increasingly dull and uninteresting, especially considering his quiet disdain for King [[Yarin Frostmantle]].<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, Ivan found himself caught up in a conspiracy in the Damaran royal court when he was reunited with [[Regis]] and [[Wulfgar]], who were both in Helgabal on the orders of the [[Morada Topolino]] to save Queen [[Concettina Delcasio]] from execution by her cruel husband, who was infertile, but blamed her for his failure to produce an heir to the throne. Convinced that they'd be unable to get her out of the country without provoking a war between Damara and [[Aglarond]], Ivan instead agreed to facilitate Wulfgar's access to the queen's bedchamber so that she could conceive a child by him, and pass off their child as the king's.<ref>{{cite book/Hero/MMP|284-289}} Ivan and Pikel were both arrested by Yarin's forces for their association with Wulfgar when Yarin found out he'd been cuckolded.<ref>{{cite book/Hero/MMP|417}}\n\nAfter the death of King Yarin, Ivan and Pikel moved back west, to [[Longsaddle]], where Ivan was given the task of guarding the ''[[portal]]'' from the [[Ivy Mansion]] to [[Gauntlgrym]].<ref> Once Gauntlgrym's ''portal'' network was properly secured, Ivan became one of the first three captains of the city's [[Grymguard]], sitting in council with King Bruenor's closest advisors.<ref>{{cite book/Starlight Enclave|76}}",
        "Possessions": "Ivan wore [[plate mail]] in combat, with a metal helm adorned with deer antlers. and a heavy [[axe]] across his back. He carried [[hand axe]]s attached to his belt."
