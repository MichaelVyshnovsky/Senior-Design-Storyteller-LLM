'''Araundor''' was a [[wizard]] from [[Mulhorand]], who became a [[lich]]. He controlled a domain known as [[Araundordoom]] in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
Araundor's body was nearly [[Skeleton|skeletal]].

==Personality==
Araundor greatly enjoyed destroying his enemies, but he usually tried to read their minds first so he could use their personal information against them. Araundor liked mocking his enemies by telling them what he had learned from reading their minds, but only when one or two adversaries remained.

==History==
A long time before [[1372 DR]], Araundor was once a [[human]] wizard in Mulhorand. However, by 1372 DR, he was a semi-crazed lich that existed only to destroy intruders in his lair.
