Zaynal was a half-elven  sorcerer and scribe living in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Zaynal was a bit of a cheat and liar. When her scrivening business was slow, she enjoyed closing her shop, disguising herself with magic, and roaming the caravanserai and Warehouse District selling false "relics" to foolish customers. Some of these items included chips of bone from the first Grand Caliph, scraps of the original scrolls of the Loregiver, and pieces of the House of the Loregiver. Zaynal used her skills to supply forged documents, all signed by Renn min Zann, to authenticate her wares.
