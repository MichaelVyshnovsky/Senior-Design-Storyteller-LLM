        "mainbody": "'''Alyn Telarson''' was a [[half-elf]] living in [[Myth Nantar]] and the regional agent of the [[Moonstars]] for the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] (or \"Inner Sea\") in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Alyn was born in [[Essembra]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, his father [[Telar]] brought him into the organization known as the [[Harpers]]. At some point, he joined the [[Moonstars]]\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Alyn was in [[Waterdeep]] when he overheard within taverns news of [[sea elves]] being attacked beneath the waves. Soon after, Khelben tasked Alyn with wandering the Sea of Fallen Stars and reporting upon any news of strange goings-on. Over time Alyn sent minor reports on goings-on in the [[Old Empires]] and what he could glean of the [[Zulkir]]s of [[Thay]]. He also infiltrated pirate crews on the Inner Sea and trade guilds in [[Ravens Bluff]], which equally seemed crafty and paranoid.\n\n''Circa'' [[1371]], on [[Eleasis 27]], Alyn wrote to Khelben a large report on the area and of his personal exploits, including some copied details from the ''[[Notes on Serôs]]'' by [[Ondam Moray]] alongside his own studies. The report gave a non-exhaustive overview of [[Serôs]], but in relation to the various islands and coastal areas on the surface.\n\nIn a section of their report titled \"The Coastal Lands,\" Alyn detailed each of the nations that bordered the Sea of Fallen Stars and their port towns. Another section of the report, which he overindulgently titled \"The Unfallen Stars,\" detailed the various islands in the area. This included [[Alaor]], the [[Archipelago of Altumbel]], the [[Eyes of Silvanus]], [[Prespur]], all of the [[Pirate Isles]], the [[Ship of the Gods]], [[Wayrock]], and the [[Whamite Isles]]. Noting that the Pirate Isles in particular had been neglected by the Harpers ever since the [[Time of Troubles]].\n\nExtracts of Alyn's report were later given by [[Elminster Aumar]] to people from [[Earth|another world]] so that they might write [[Sea of Fallen Stars (sourcebook)|a book about the Sea of Fallen Stars]]."
