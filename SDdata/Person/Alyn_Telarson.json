        "mainbody": "Alyn Telarson was a half-elf living in Myth Nantar and the regional agent of the Moonstars for the Sea of Fallen Stars (or \"Inner Sea\") in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.\nAlyn was born in Essembra. In the , his father Telar brought him into the organization known as the Harpers. At some point, he joined the Moonstars\nIn the , Alyn was in Waterdeep when he overheard within taverns news of sea elves being attacked beneath the waves. Soon after, Khelben tasked Alyn with wandering the Sea of Fallen Stars and reporting upon any news of strange goings-on. Over time Alyn sent minor reports on goings-on in the Old Empires and what he could glean of the Zulkirs of Thay. He also infiltrated pirate crews on the Inner Sea and trade guilds in Ravens Bluff, which equally seemed crafty and paranoid.\nCirca 1371, on Eleasis 27, Alyn wrote to Khelben a large report on the area and of his personal exploits, including some copied details from the Notes on Serôs by Ondam Moray alongside his own studies. The report gave a non-exhaustive overview of Serôs, but in relation to the various islands and coastal areas on the surface.\nIn a section of their report titled \"The Coastal Lands,\" Alyn detailed each of the nations that bordered the Sea of Fallen Stars and their port towns. Another section of the report, which he overindulgently titled \"The Unfallen Stars,\" detailed the various islands in the area. This included Alaor, the Archipelago of Altumbel, the Eyes of Silvanus, Prespur, all of the Pirate Isles, the Ship of the Gods, Wayrock, and the Whamite Isles. Noting that the Pirate Isles in particular had been neglected by the Harpers ever since the Time of Troubles.\nExtracts of Alyns report were later given by Elminster Aumar to people from another world so that they might write a book about the Sea of Fallen Stars."
