        "mainbody": "akanga Otamu () was a merchant prince in Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 century DR. He was an information broker of sorts, offering lost lore and arcane knowledge as well as dealing in magical items.\nWakanga was a wealthy Chultan merchant and the only arcane spellcaster among Port Nyanzarus merchant princes. who had a masterful command of his Art. He was capable of quickly learning ancient and powerful Chultan spells.\nHe enjoyed lifes luxuries, especially pleasures of the flesh. Those who called on him at his villa might find him absorbed in gilded tomes and disinterested in speaking until he had finished his reading.\nHe was quick to embrace friends of his friends, and if he took an interest in a visitor to Port Nyanzaru, he might grant them certain protections within the city.\nWakanga held a monopoly over the sale of magic items in the city of Port Nyanzaru, which mostly meant potions and spell scrolls As it was illegal to buy or sell such items without his approval in the city, he had complete control over prices and rarely extended credit (although he was willing to trade for gemstones and jewelry as part of his payment). In partnership with fellow merchant prince Ekene-Afa, he also received a cut of all sales of enchanted weapons and shields as he was paid to provide the enchantments. For explorers intending to travel underwater, Wakanga had a selection of items to offer, including potions of cold resistance, scrolls of freedom of movement, and scrolls or potions of water breathing. He was also known to procure specific items or relics for special clients.\nIn addition to selling magic items, he was a loremaster and dealt in the sale of information, maps, and ancient or lost lore. For example, this included knowledge of things such as the sites of long lost shrines to Ubtao, testimonials and rituals of ancient Chultans, or the locations of hidden treasures. He was well-versed in Chultan history&mdashsuch as the theories surrounding Ubtaos abandonment of Chult&mdashas well as current events of relevance to his city&mdashsuch as the headquarters of certain pirate groups. He knew relatively little about lands to the north of Chult, although he knew by reputation of such cities as Neverwinter and Waterdeep. He likewise knew little about the lost city of Omu, although he was familiar with their Nine Trickster Gods and even honored those spirits to some extent.\nAs a merchant prince, Wakanga was part of the council that ruled Port Nyanzaru from the palace of Goldenthrone. He took it upon himself to hire mercenaries to protect merchant ships from pirates (especially those containing his own goods), to send explorers into the jungle in search of trade routes, and to hire adventurers to keep the surrounding lands safe. In some cases, adventurers were rewarded for their service with valuable maps from his library.\nWakanga maintained a personal collection and library of magic, lore, maps, and books (including spellbooks), some of which he was willing to gift, trade, or loan with adventurers. and he was known to hire adventurers to retrieve new treasure maps, to explore ruins for magic items, and to delve into ancient temples to acquire idols or carved glyphs said to hum with Ubtaos magic.\nHe was known to cooperate with historians seeking to learn more about Chults past.\nthumb|300px|Prince Otamu at his villa.\nHe had an opulent and well-fortified villa in Port Nyanzaru. The walls were beautifully painted and decorated with hanging rugs. The mansion was lit by continual flame spells and by drifting balls of light, with magical music playing softly all throughout. The front doors could magically open on their own, while the interior doors to private rooms were protected with arcane lock spells. Many decorative items were in fact defensive measures, namely flying swords hanging on the walls and rugs of smothering on the floors. An outer courtyard contained a shrine to the gods.\nHis villa further had garden courtyards with innovative water features and housed his impressive menagerie.\nHe had his own fast boats in the harbor that could quickly ferry his agents out to sea.\nWakanga was one of seven merchant princes who ruled Port Nyanzaru. Of the others, he had attracted the ire and jealously of Ifan Talroa but was on good terms with Ekene-Afa\nHe had a business partner whose daughter, Teyileri Siwifi, spent much of her idle time at his villa enjoying his menagerie.\nWakanga was acquainted with Niles Breakbone of the Order of the Gauntlet. Wakanga also became acquainted with Volo and Minsc during the late 15 century DR.\nWakanga was cousin to Bwayes Otamu, a weretiger that lived with a group of vegepygmies within a wrecked ship in the middle of the jungle. As a child, Wakanga was quite close with Bwayes.\nAt his villa, a blacksmith named Tamrat Dejenhiwot had a forge in the outer courtyard.\nHe had an agent named Obaya Uday, a priest of Waukeen who travelled to Waterdeep to procure magic items and spellbooks.\nBy the time that Port Nyanzaru gained its independence from Amn in the late 15 century DR, Wakanga had become one of the richest people in Chult.\nWakanga befriended Syndra Silvane during her many visits to Port Nyanzaru, and when she was afflicted by the death curse many years later, she stayed with him when she traveled back to Chult seeking a cure. However, he was willing to part with a journal in his possession that provided hints to the location of Vorn. When adventurers from Neverwinter arrived in the city also seeking to end the death curse, Wakanga provided them with a small compound from which to plan their expedition.\nWhen Idrianne Smoke attacked Port Nyanzaru with her army of fiendish pirates, Wakanga sought to retrieve a powerful ancient spell scroll from beneath the ziggurats of the Old City that would allow him to embolden the entire citys defenders at once.\nAt some point, Wakanga acquired an artifact from an unreputable merchant that was in fact being sought by a tribe of Batiri goblins. The goblins stormed the city alongside a tyrannosaur and besieged his villa in an attempt to take it from him.\nAs of , he was interested in acquiring magical treasures from the Sword Coast, and on his behalf, Obaya Uday began sponsoring expeditions into Undermountain."
