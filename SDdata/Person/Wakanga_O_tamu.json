        "Personality": "{{Fq\n| text = Bah, life's too short for such worries!\n| source = Wakanga O'tamu\n}}\nHe enjoyed life's luxuries, especially pleasures of the flesh. Those who called on him at his villa might find him absorbed in gilded [[book|tomes]] and disinterested in speaking until he had finished his reading.\n\nHe was quick to embrace friends of his friends, and if he took an interest in a visitor to Port Nyanzaru, he might grant them certain protections within the city.",

            "Business": "Wakanga held a monopoly over the sale of [[magic item]]s in the city of Port Nyanzaru, which mostly meant [[potion]]s and [[spell scroll]]s{{Cite adventurers league/Cauldron of Sapphire|4}} As it was illegal to buy or sell such items without his approval in the city, he had complete control over prices and rarely extended credit (although he was willing to trade for [[gemstone]]s and [[jewelry]] as part of his payment). In partnership with fellow merchant prince [[Ekene-Afa]], he also received a cut of all sales of [[enchanted]] [[weapon]]s and [[shield]]s as he was paid to provide the [[enchantment]]s. For explorers intending to travel underwater, Wakanga had a selection of items to offer, including ''[[potion of cold resistance|potions of cold resistance]]'', [[Freedom of movement|scrolls of ''freedom of movement'']], and [[Water breathing|scrolls]] or ''[[potion of water breathing|potions of water breathing]]''. He was also known to procure specific items or relics for special clients.\n\nIn addition to selling magic items, he was a [[loremaster]]{{Cite adventurers league/A Lesson in Love|8}} and dealt in the sale of information, [[map]]s, and ancient or lost lore. For example, this included knowledge of things such as the sites of long lost shrines to [[Ubtao]], testimonials and [[ritual]]s of ancient Chultans, or the locations of hidden treasures. He was well-versed in Chultan history&mdash;such as the theories surrounding Ubtao's abandonment of Chult&mdash;as well as current events of relevance to his city&mdash;such as the headquarters of certain pirate groups. He knew relatively little about lands to the [[Sword Coast|north]] of Chult, although he knew by reputation of such cities as [[Neverwinter]] and [[Waterdeep]]. He likewise knew little about the lost city of [[Omu]], although he was familiar with their [[Nine Trickster Gods]] and even honored those [[primal spirit|spirits]] to some extent.",
            "Governance": "{{Fq\n| text =   If the prince has taken interest in you, you would do well not to die on your first expedition.\n| source = [[Ze'Vana Ritzulma]]\n}}\nAs a merchant prince, Wakanga was part of the council that ruled Port Nyanzaru from the palace of [[Goldenthrone]]. He took it upon himself to hire mercenaries to protect merchant [[ship]]s from pirates (especially those containing his own goods), to send explorers into the jungle in search of trade routes, and to hire [[adventurer]]s to keep the surrounding lands safe. In some cases, adventurers were rewarded for their service with valuable maps from his library.",
            "Personal": "Wakanga maintained a personal collection and library of magic, lore, maps, and books (including [[spellbook]]s), some of which he was willing to gift, trade, or loan with adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/A Lesson in Love|3}} and he was known to hire adventurers to retrieve new treasure maps, to explore ruins for magic items, and to delve into ancient temples to acquire idols or carved [[glyph]]s said to hum with Ubtao's magic.\n\nHe was known to cooperate with [[historian]]s seeking to learn more about Chult's past."

        "Possessions": "[[File:Wakanga.png|thumb|300px|''Prince O'tamu at his villa.'']]\nHe had an opulent and well-fortified villa in Port Nyanzaru. The walls were beautifully painted and decorated with hanging [[rug]]s. The mansion was lit by ''[[continual flame]]'' spells and by drifting balls of light, with magical [[music]] playing softly all throughout. The front doors could magically open on their own, while the interior doors to private rooms were protected with ''[[arcane lock]]'' spells. Many decorative items were in fact defensive measures, namely [[flying sword]]s hanging on the walls and [[rug of smothering|rugs of smothering]] on the floors. An outer courtyard contained a shrine to the [[god]]s.\n\nHis villa further had garden courtyards with innovative water features and housed his impressive menagerie.\n\nHe had his own fast [[boat]]s in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|harbor]] that could quickly ferry his agents out to sea.",
