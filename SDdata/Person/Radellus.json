        "mainbody": "Radellus was a mage at some point before the turn of the 9 century DR.\nBy the end of his life, Radellus had wearied of Amns intrigues.\nAt some point before the turn of the 9 century, Radellus decided to retire to a tower east of Sreve, and slew the previous owner, Justal Iroon, for it. During the battle, a local young boy of the village, Kurtal, snuck in and made out with three of Justal Iroons spellbooks, which he then used for practice. Radellus flung Justal Iroons smoking body the length of Sreves main street it was then whisked into the millpond, killing all its fish.\nAt some point afterwards, but still prior to the year , the same young boy, now an experienced mage, came and blasted him to ashes."
