        "mainbody": "'''Ulden Stargath''' was the last son of the powerful [[Arklen]] family of [[Purskul]], [[Amn]] who disappeared several decades before [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "The [[Stargath House]], an inn in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], was formerly Ulden's home. A well-known Purskan legend claimed that Ulden Stargath's house hid a secret door and \"falling wall\" traps in its basement, where his much-hated aunts' corpses laid hidden. Many claimed that Ulden was the cause of the disappearance of his mother and her four sisters soon after his father, [[Raervo Arklen]], put the family fortune into a will that divided the fortune among the Arklen sisters. Old Raervo Arklen's fortune was locked inside chests and locked within [[helmed horror]]s tasked to guard each of the Arklen sisters. Surviving descendants of the Arklen sisters speculated that Ulden Stargath found a way to tamper with the magics that controlled the [[construct]]s and used them to lure away and dispose of his mother and aunts.\n\nWhether this speculation was true or not, Ulden Stargath disappeared soon after, and as of the late 14{{th}} century DR, his fate remained a mystery. Eventually, his home was turned into a house of hospitality."
