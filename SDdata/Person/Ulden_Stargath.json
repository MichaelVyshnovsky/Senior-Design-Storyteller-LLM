        "mainbody": "lden Stargath was the last son of the powerful Arklen family of Purskul, Amn who disappeared several decades before 1370 DR.\nThe Stargath House, an inn in the late 14 century DR, was formerly Uldens home. A well-known Purskan legend claimed that Ulden Stargaths house hid a secret door and \"falling wall\" traps in its basement, where his much-hated aunts corpses laid hidden. Many claimed that Ulden was the cause of the disappearance of his mother and her four sisters soon after his father, Raervo Arklen, put the family fortune into a will that divided the fortune among the Arklen sisters. Old Raervo Arklens fortune was locked inside chests and locked within helmed horrors tasked to guard each of the Arklen sisters. Surviving descendants of the Arklen sisters speculated that Ulden Stargath found a way to tamper with the magics that controlled the constructs and used them to lure away and dispose of his mother and aunts.\nWhether this speculation was true or not, Ulden Stargath disappeared soon after, and as of the late 14 century DR, his fate remained a mystery. Eventually, his home was turned into a house of hospitality."
