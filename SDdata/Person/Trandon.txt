'''Trandon''' was a fifty-year-old quarterstaff-wielding warrior, secretly a wizard, who spent years recruiting for the [[Hammers of Tyr]]. 

{{quote|''Trandon carefully looked from side to side, spying for onlookers-most especially other members of his party. It would be supremely difficult to resist using magic during this mission, but no one must know he was a wizard. He must maintain his cover at all costs.''}}

==Description==
Trandon appeared to be a leather-clad fighter of roughly fifty years. He kept his silver-streaked hair long and tied in a ponytail. His right arm appeared to be healthy even though Trandon claimed it was permanently damaged by a vampire in the past, making him unable to wield the weapon of his faith - a warhammer..

==Personality==
Trandon kept his ability to use arcane spells a secret even from his closest allies. He likely used the wound dealt to him by a vampire in the past as an excuse to wield a quarterstaff as opposed to fighter weapons. Trandon felt deep insecurity and shame regarding his arcane abilities, thinking the magic to be dangerous and irresponsible.

==Abilities==
Secretly a wizard, Trandon's senses were finely tuned to the rhythms of magic. He could feel the arcane energies surrounding [[Skillport]] and its residents.

==Possessions==
Trandon used [[leather armor]] and his trusty thick ashen [[quarterstaff]] in battle.

==Relationships==
Not a member himself, Trandon was highly trusted by the [[Hammers of Tyr]] as he spent years wandering [[Cormyr]] recruiting for their cause. His real affilition was to the [[War Wizards]] of [[Cormyr]], where he was a a member of the leadership [[Council of War Wizards]]. 

==History==
Trandon lived a long life filled with battles. At one point in the past, he claimed to have had a close encounter with a [[vampire]] that permanently drained the health from his right arm. The alleged wound proved to be uncurable with cleric magic and healing ointments alike.

In [[1371 DR]],{{DDTS}} on Eleint 17 and 18, Trandon, representing the Hammers of Tyr, was in attendance at the wedding ceremony between the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] and [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. 

The wedding concluded with an assassination attempt and the bride's abduction. Trandon was recruited to be a part of the rescue team assembled by [[Khelben Arunsun]] to travel through [[Undermountain]] to reach the only ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Utter East]] that was in the vicinity of the city. Blackstaff was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of [[Kern Desanea|Kern's]] anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choice — traveling through [[Skullport]]. 

When the paladins reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding [[zombies]] by the mysterious [[Skulls of Skullport]] in penance for destroying one of the watchers. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Trandon was weary of the abundance of dangerous magics practiced by the residents of Skullport. Eventually, he encountered a limping zombie carrying its own foot. Making sure no one can see the cast magic, Trandon used a ''[[mending]]'' spell to fix the shambling undead's leg, fulfilling the Skulls' task.

After the paladins passed out of Skullport, they encountered a group of [[Ettin|ettins]]. An unfortunate skirmish let to the death of [[Harloon]], who was set aflame on a funeral pyre before the paladins moved on.

Closer to the destination, the paladins came across [[tanar'ri]] aiming to use the same portal as the heroes. [[Barlgura]]s were using a magical mirror located not far from the ''portal'' to create duplicates of themselves. In the ensuing battle, [[Able]] was killed and [[Kastonoph Nesher|Noph]] got captured by two fiends, [[Shaakat]] and [[Rejik]]. They held him, hostage, to destroy the rest of the party. However, he successfully distracted them so the surviving paladins were able to penetrate the fiends’ circle of protection against [[law]]. The fiends fled, and [[Aleena Paladinstar]] sent Trandon and the others off through the gate.
During the escape from the [[fiend]]s besieging [[Eldrinpar]] in the kingdom of [[Doegan]] in the [[Utter East]] Trandon was forced to unveil his true colors.
