        "mainbody": "Silky was a cat familiar owned by the wizard Klazakstrata.\nSilky had a sleek body with gray fur and blue eyes.\nAt some point while adventuring with her master, Silky was enchanted with the ability to shift between the Prime Material plane and  the Ethereal Plane.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the wizard Klazakstrata was hired by Tilnacci Lamstrand to help her construct a mechanical portal between her port town of Sundrah and some gnomish community in the Western Heartlands. When Klazakstrata eventually made his way to leave the port a building fell atop him, leaving many to presume Silky had died along with him. But in actuality the cat lived and, grief-stricken, blamed Tilnacii for her masters death and began plotting revenge.\nAfter waiting a few weeks to be forgotten, Silky began hanging around the house and in no time was taken in. After waiting a few more weeks to become accepted by the Lamstrand family she began stealing small objects from around their house, which most explained away as the victim being absentminded. She tossed some into the ocean, hid some for later in a crawl space under the house, or used them in schemes, such as planting them in the drawer or pouch of another family member. Over time, Silky fostered disputes and rivalries within the Lamstrand household.\nEventually Silky grew tired of the petty trouble she was causing and sought out some way to cause more damage to the Lamstrands. She hoped that one of the many visitors that regularly came through their portal might have something she could use."
