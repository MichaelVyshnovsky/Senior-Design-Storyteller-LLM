        "mainbody": "'''Dravidge''' was a clerk who worked at [[Candulhallow's Funeral Arrangements]] in the [[Heapside]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Candulhallow's Funeral Arrangements was run by a secret [[Bhaal|Bhaalist]] cabal â€“ the [[Murder Tribunal]]. Clerk Dravidge was instructed to crank up the prices so high that very little stock was ever sold by \"the Management.\" Dravidge was to do the bare minimum to make the shop appear legitimate. As per an instructional memo from \"the Management,\" the shop was more of a stage than an actual business."
