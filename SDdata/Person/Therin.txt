'''Therin''' was the strongman of [[Janol Famisso|Pinch]]'s thieves guild. 

==Personality==
Therin was ambitious and had tried unsuccessfully to become the boss of the gang instead of Pinch. Pinch would easily sacrifice him if the situation required.

==History==
Therin was a [[Gur]] in [[Elturel]]. He was working as a "stooge for a fortune-teller" when Pinch recruited him. He suffered many scars from a hangman before the gang saved him. Therin was one of the thieves that followed his boss back to [[Ankhapur]] to regain his body.

By [[1370 DR]], Therin had established his own thieves' guild, the [[Bloody Scarves]], within the city.
