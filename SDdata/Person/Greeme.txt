'''Greeme''' was a nefarious [[warrior]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Greeme was the head of a group of bodyguards who served [[Sumer]], a wicked [[cleric]] of [[Talos]]. Greeme and his cronies would assist Sumer in hunting down [[adventurer]]s to sacrifice to the Destroyer. He favored using [[poison]] on his weapons.
