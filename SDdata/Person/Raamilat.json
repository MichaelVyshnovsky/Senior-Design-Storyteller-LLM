        "mainbody": "Raamilat was a powerful drow wizard who allied himself with Jon Irenicus.\nWhen Irenicus attacked his former home, Suldanessellar, he struck a pact with the dark elves of Ust Natha. Raamilat, along with a summoned nabassu, joined in on this assault and blocked access to the house of the elven high priestess Demin. It was essential to block access to Demin, as she had information for Gorions Ward about Irenicus. Raamilat attacked the party of the ward with an array of spells, summoned creatures, and an enchanted quarterstaff. Eventually, he was slain by the party, and the priestess was saved."
