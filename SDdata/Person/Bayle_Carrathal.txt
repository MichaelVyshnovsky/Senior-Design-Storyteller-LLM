==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]] of Callidyrr and was the sole heir of his father and predecessor, [[Alec Carrathal III]].

==History==
Bayle assumed the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1030}}, after his father died in a fire.

In the {{YearlinkName|1052}}, Bayle sent a small fleet to annex the islands of [[Jannath's Tears]] into his kingdom. However, [[Baldur's Gate]] came to the islands' defense and sank his ships.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}} Due to this humiliation, Bayle was deposed and killed that same year.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|31}} He was succeeded by his father's grandniece, [[Yolanda Carrathal]].
