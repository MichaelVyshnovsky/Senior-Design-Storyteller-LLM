'''Ilnezhara''' was a [[copper dragon]] who lived in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].

==Description==
Her [[human]] form was that of an attractive woman with a shock of thick, copper-colored hair and huge blue eyes. She was often  dressed in the finest of threads. Her figure was straight, tall, and slender.

==History==
The dragon was centuries old by [[1368 DR]]. She had a sister, [[Tazmikella]], with whom she crawled from her egg in the great deserts of [[Calimshan]].

She and her sister were once approached by [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King, with the offer of immortality in [[lich|lichdom]] if they served beside his conquering armies. The dragon sisters declined that offer.

In [[1368 DR]], Ilnezhara was operating a shop at [[Wall's Around]] in [[Heliogabalus]] called "[[Ilnezhara's Gold Coins]]".

In [[1484 DR]], Ilnezhara was posing as the human "Lady Zee," the owner of a curiosity shop called [[A Pocketful of Zzzzs]] at Wall's Around in [[Helgabal]]. That year, the [[drow]] [[Jarlaxle]] approached her and her sister, requesting them to help him in the events surrounding the [[Darkening]] and the involvement of several [[white dragon]]s.

==Relationships==
For some time she was the lover of the [[drow]] [[mercenary]] [[Jarlaxle]]. She found him quite charming.
