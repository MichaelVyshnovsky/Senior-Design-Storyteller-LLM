Ilnezhara was a copper dragon who lived in the Bloodstone Lands.
Her human form was that of an attractive woman with a shock of thick, copper-colored hair and huge blue eyes. She was often  dressed in the finest of threads. Her figure was straight, tall, and slender.
The dragon was centuries old by 1368 DR. She had a sister, Tazmikella, with whom she crawled from her egg in the great deserts of Calimshan.
She and her sister were once approached by Zhengyi, the Witch-King, with the offer of immortality in lichdom if they served beside his conquering armies. The dragon sisters declined that offer.
In 1368 DR, Ilnezhara was operating a shop at Walls Around in Heliogabalus called "Ilnezharas Gold Coins".
In 1484 DR, Ilnezhara was posing as the human "Lady Zee," the owner of a curiosity shop called A Pocketful of Zzzzs at Walls Around in Helgabal. That year, the drow Jarlaxle approached her and her sister, requesting them to help him in the events surrounding the Darkening and the involvement of several white dragons.
For some time she was the lover of the drow mercenary Jarlaxle. She found him quite charming.
