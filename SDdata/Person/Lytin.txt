'''Lytin''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] at the [[Scarlet Moon Hall]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis in [[1491 DR]].

==History==
Lytin was one of the many Eternal Flame cultists disguised as [[druid]]s who waited to take part in the [[Rite of the Wicker Giant]]. She waited with her three guardians [[Biart]], [[Orm]], and [[Malin]], but they were confronted and defeated by some adventurers.
