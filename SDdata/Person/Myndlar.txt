Myndlar was a monk of Candlekeep.
Myndlar hailed from Athkatla but settled in Candlekeep.
In 1487 DR, Elminster Aumar, disguised as Andannas Dalkur, spoke to him about Orold Archemusks writings.
Myndlar believed that dragons sought to steer human thought by writing books, purporting to be human women, and by sending dreams to humans whod established reputations as writers.
