'''Glut''' was a [[myconid]] that lived in the [[Underdark]] near [[Ebonlake Grotto]].
{{Quote|Flesh walker, tongue-talker, far you've come.|Glut}}

==Description==
The myconid sovereign appeared more short and rotund than others of their species. Glut was also much darker than other myconids and parts of his body emitted a faint orange glow. Small blue mushrooms grew over many parts of his body. Glut weighed 100 kg.

==Possessions==
Glut kept a number of [[magic]] [[scroll]]s, as well as two magical items: a pair of ''[[featherlight boots]]'' and a ''[[ring of fire]]''.

==Abilities==
Being a myconid sovereign, Glut had access to several powerful abilities. Glut was able to release spores to animate [[spore servants]] to do his bidding. The sovereign could even ''[[raise dead]]'' at will. Glut was able to attack swiftly with his large appendages.

==History==
In the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[duergar]] stormed Glut's home and killed his fellow myconids. Glut claimed to have sang to another myconid sovereign, [[Spaw]], in order for assistance, but Spaw was unwilling.

As a sovereign without a circle, Glut wandered the Underdark to find a new myconid colony. The once-sovereign found a new circle of myconids in the Underdark located beneath the Western Heartlands, however, they did not welcome Glut. Glut wished to somehow become the sovereign of this colony, and wanted to prove himself by cleansing the duergar "rot". After his plan to kill the local duergar, he planned to take down the existing myconid sovereign, Spaw, and begin a new age, where he would rule.
