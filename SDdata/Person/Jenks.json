        "mainbody": "Jenks was a street urchin from Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nJenks had a somewhat stocky build. Like most Turami, he had dark skin. His hair was a darker shade of brown than his skin, and was cut almost down to the roots.\nDespite being shy around strangers, Jenks was brave and fiercely defended his friends.\nHe wore a robe and carried a toy wand and a stuffed owlbear, which he called his \"familiar\".\nthumb|right|A closeup of Jenks likeness.\nJenks was part of the group of street urchins that included his friends Nat and Squiddly. Since Nat was deaf, Jenks and Squiddly communicated with her using a sign language Nat had invented.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Jenks and his friends were unwittingly entangled in the city-wide hunt for the Stone of Golorr, sometimes innocently helping or hindering the efforts of adventurers in retrieving it."
