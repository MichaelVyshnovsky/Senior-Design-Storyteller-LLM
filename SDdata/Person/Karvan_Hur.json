        "mainbody": "Lieutenant Karvan Hur was the ranking officer of the contingent of guards stationed at the Thayan enclave within the city of Proskur during the late 14 century DR. While he and his men were technically subordinate to the enclaves Red Wizards and their handful of Thayan knights, they were largely ignored by these groups.\nKarven led a group of 36 guards, who were divided into five six-man squads, most of whom were Thayan. Amongst them were a few foreign-born mercenaries, though they were closely observed by their superiors.\nAmongst his guards stationed throughout the enclave, Lieutenant Hur kept at least one wizard stationed at the front gate, armed with either a wand of detect magic or wand of detect thoughts to glean more insight into those who entered within."
