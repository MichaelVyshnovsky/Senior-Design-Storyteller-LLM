'''Veldyn "the Fingers" Uruin''' was a notorious thief of [[Telflamm]] in [[Thesk]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}

When Chansreena (princess) [[Alabhansree Alanasker]] of [[Ormpur]] and her dowry went missing in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Veldyn was one of three thieves named as suspects by High Suikh (king) [[Helbareim Alanasker]], but was innocent. Veldyn could well have gone looking for the real thief, perhaps deciding to have the loot as well as the blame.
