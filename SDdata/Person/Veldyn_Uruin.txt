Veldyn "the Fingers" Uruin was a notorious thief of Telflamm in Thesk in the midâ€“14 century DR.
When Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur and her dowry went missing in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Veldyn was one of three thieves named as suspects by High Suikh (king) Helbareim Alanasker, but was innocent. Veldyn could well have gone looking for the real thief, perhaps deciding to have the loot as well as the blame.
