        "mainbody": "Senator '''Inthelph''' was the Master Builder of the city-state of [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was also a wealthy aristocrat and a member of the senate that governed the city.<ref>",
        "Description": "He was a stout man who had jet-black hair, dark eyes, and brown leathery skin.",
        "Abilities": "Inthelph was trained as an engineer, but he was not very competent.<ref>",
        "Possessions": "He was very wealthy and possessed an estate north of the city in a place called Berrywilde that had belonged to his ancestors.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "He had a daughter named [[Phyrea]], whom he pampered. He tried to get her to marry [[Willem Korvan]], his assistant, in the hope that he would be a steadying influence on her.<ref>\n\nWillem Korvan was his assistant in the office of the Master Builder of Innarlith<ref>. Inthelph gave assignments to Korvan that he couldn't do himself and Korvan in turn would go to [[Ivar Devorast]], his former classmate in Innarlith, to help them both while not giving him credit for what he designed.<ref>\n\nAs a member of the aristocracy and the city's elite, Inthelph had relations and alliances with other senators in Innarlith.<ref>",
        "History": "Inthelph was the Master Builder of Innarlith by at least the late 1350s DR. In [[1358 DR]], he traveled to [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]], where he attended a presentation of work done by graduating engineering students at a school there. He met Willem Korvan and recruited him to help with the rebuilding of the city-wall of Innarlith. Korvan accompanied Inthelph back to Innarlith and ended up relying upon Ivar Devorast to do the designs to complete the project, which Inthelph in turn submitted as his own.<ref>\n\nThe project for the wall had gone over-budget and was being widely criticized. The help that he got from Korvan (and Devorast ultimately) may have saved his career as the Master Builder of Innarlith.<ref>\n\nSimilar things happened with other projects, including the completion of a keep north of the city at the [[Nagaflow]] river and the building of a new spire for the Palace of Many Spires in Innarlith, both of which he assigned to Korvan and Korvan in turn went to get Devorast to help with them.<ref>\n\nHe became fond of Korvan and decided to help him advance himself in Innarlith's society by helping him to become a senator. He also encouraged Korvan to marry his daughter Phyrea and become part of their family.<ref>\n\nWhen Devorast received permission from the Ransar to begin work on building a canal that would connect the Lake of Steam to the Sea of Fallen Stars, Inthelph was opposed to the project. He was the master builder of Innarlith, but he had not been brought in to do this, with the Ransar instead assigning control of the work directly to Devorast.<ref>\n\nInthelph supported Willem Korvan to take over the canal project from Devorast, although Willem himself secretly didn't believe he was competent to do it. Eventually when [[Salatis]] became the new Ransar, Inthelph's wishes were fulfilled and Devorast was replaced with Willem as the new master builder of the canal. Willem also eventually married Phyrea as his wife in a ceremony officiated by a [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] that Inthelph didn't attend. <ref>\n\nWillem was later murdered by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]] and turned into an [[undead]] thrall to serve Marek. Marek then ordered the undead Willem to assassinate Inthelph. Willem entered Inthelph's home and killed him, while apologizing to Inthelph for what he was doing, as he had no ability to will otherwise. \n\nAfter his death he appeared to his daughter as a [[ghost]] several times in order to help her. He told her how to destroy Willem using their family's sword. <ref>"
