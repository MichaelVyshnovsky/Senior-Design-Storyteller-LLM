'''Golias''' was a [[dwarf]] [[fighter]] and [[adventurer]] of the [[Puppetmasters]] company ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Golias was a stubbornly loyal and fearless warrior, who was fanatically devoted to his leader [[Brenna]]. He would grimly fight to the death if necessary.

==Possessions==
Golias specialized in his ''+3 [[dwarven thrower]]'', and protected himself with ''+4 [[chain mail]]'' and a [[shield]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Puppetmasters came up with a scheme to win an easy prize for the company. They planted a letter and treasure map leading to the dungeon of [[Barrenstone]], allowing another adventuring group to excavate and clear out the complex. When they emerged from the dungeon with the treasure, the Puppetmasters attempted to rob their victims, only to be driven off and receive nothing for their troubles.
