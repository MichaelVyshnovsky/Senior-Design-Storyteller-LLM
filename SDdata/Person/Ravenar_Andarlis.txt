'''Ravenar Andarlis''' was a [[Netherese]] businessman who operated the [[Grocer Cartel]] and [[Andarlis Transport]] in [[Netheril]] before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Ravenar served as the guildmaster of the Grocer Cartel and owned Andarlis Transport as well. He was a fair dealer in his affairs, but only used favorable contracts whenever possible, and was utterly ruthless when he had the advantage. He was rumored to be the master of the [[thieves' guild]] in the Loft, but it was actually controlled by his brother, [[Silvin Andarlis]].
