'''Jayne Nettlebee''' was the wife of [[Bertram Nettlebee]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Jayne was a no-nonsense lady who knew how to handle Wiggan, Bertram, and other loudmouths. She was afraid however and most concerned for her children. She did not know her husband's true allegiance.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], she was unwittingly involved in a trap set by her family for some adventurers who had defeated the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] at the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]. At the end of the tragedy, she assumed the role of the new matriarch of the [[Nettlebee]] clan.
