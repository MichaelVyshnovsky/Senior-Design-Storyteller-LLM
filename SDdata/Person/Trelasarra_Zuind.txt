Trelasarra Zuind was a priestess of Eilistraee, informal leader of the newly restored Promenade of the Dark Maiden as of the 1490s DR.
Trelasaarra was a kind and gentle soul. She wished to live engaging in the worship of Eilistraee and putting her teachings in practice. However, she was also well aware of the threats posed to the newly restored Promenade, and was ready to fight and take all the measures needed to protect the people living there.
Trelasarras drink of choice was moonwine served in long and thin drinking horns. However, that changed when Elminster introduced her to hot chocolate, topped with marshmallows.
After Eilistraees return during the Second Sundering and her personal appearance in avatar form under the walls of Waterdeep, Trelasarra and a group of other moondancers traveled to city. They contacted Remallia Haventree, representative of the Harpers, and persuaded her to grant them the possibility to create a forest-temple to Eilistraee (The Dancing Haven) within the Field Ward. However, due to chaotic developments in that area, the Dancing Haven was instead created in the North Ward, in the form of a a small tree grove encased by a roofless building.
From there, Trelasarra led the followers of Eilistraee in Waterdeep on a series of expeditions to cleanse, resupply, and rebuild the lost Promenade of the Dark Maiden, the headquarters of the Church of Eilistraee, in the Undermountain. After the restoration of the temple, Trelasarra, a dozen clerics of the Dark Maiden, four novices, and nine lay warriors moved there. They established a new base of operations, linked to the Dancing Haven in Waterdeep. The followers of Eilistraee tried to keep their presence a secret but, as rumors started spreading in the near and dangerous Skullport, Trelasarra opted to garrison the temple as if at war.
