==Personality==
Trelasaarra was a kind and gentle soul. She wished to live engaging in the worship of [[Eilistraee]] and putting her [[Church of Eilistraee#Eilistraee's Teachings|teachings]] in practice. However, she was also well aware of the threats posed to the newly restored Promenade, and was ready to fight and take all the measures needed to protect the people living there.

Trelasarra's drink of choice was [[moonwine]] served in long and thin drinking [[horn]]s. However, that changed when [[Elminster]] introduced her to [[hot chocolate]], topped with [[marshmallow]]s.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-05-08 - Trelasarra's Drink of Choice}}

==History==
After Eilistraee's return during the [[Second Sundering]] and her personal appearance in [[avatar]] form under the walls of [[Waterdeep]], Trelasarra and a group of other [[Church of Eilistraee|moondancers]] traveled to city. They contacted [[Remallia Haventree]], representative of the [[Harpers]], and persuaded her to grant them the possibility to create a forest-temple to Eilistraee ([[The Dancing Haven]]) within the [[Field Ward of Waterdeep|Field Ward]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2018-12-24 - Death Masks}} However, due to chaotic developments in that area, the Dancing Haven was instead created in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]], in the form of a a small tree grove encased by a roofless building.

From there, Trelasarra led the followers of Eilistraee in Waterdeep on a series of expeditions to cleanse, resupply, and rebuild the lost [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]], the headquarters of the [[Church of Eilistraee]], in the [[Undermountain]].{{Cite web/The Legends of Adventures in the Forgotten Realms}} After the restoration of the temple, Trelasarra, a dozen clerics of the Dark Maiden, four novices, and nine lay warriors moved there. They established a new base of operations, linked to the Dancing Haven in Waterdeep. The followers of Eilistraee tried to keep their presence a secret but, as rumors started spreading in the near and dangerous [[Skullport]], Trelasarra opted to garrison the temple as if at war.
