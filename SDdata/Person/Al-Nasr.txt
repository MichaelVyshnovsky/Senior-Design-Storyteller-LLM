'''Al-Nasr''', which was [[Midani language|Midani]] for '''the Vulture''', was a mysterious [[ajami]] [[necromancer]] who inhabited the city of [[Hilm]] in the [[Pantheist League]] of [[interior Zakhara]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{AQ-time}}

Little was known about Al-Nasr save that he tutored both [[Ezarhaddon bin Kior]] and his wife [[Inanna az-Khunjhati]], both of whom would later become the Necromancer King and Queen of the ruined city of [[Ysawis]], in the dark arts of [[necromancy]].
