Corporal Bence Duncan was a soldier serving within the Flaming Fist mercenary company during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Corporal Duncan was extremely dutiful individual.
He thought quite highly of the Flaming Fists general, Marshal Kyrill Nederlok.
Around Eleint 1, in the , Corporal Duncan was tasked with leading a contingent of Flaming Fists to scout out the rapidly-growing army that was forming up around Dragonspear Castle. By Uktar 3 he had returned from his mission and presented his findings to Marshal Nederlok.
Shortly thereafter, Duke Entar Silvershield tasked the corporal with the protection of his daughter Skie, as he knew she would attempt to discreetly tag along with the newly-formed Coalition army.
Bence Duncan worked closely with the Hero of Baldurs Gate during his involvement with the Coalition and the War of the Shining Crusade. He and his soldiers guarded the entrance to the portal that was opened beneath Dragonspear Castle, during the final battle of the war.
After the portal was closed, Bence discovered the body of the deceased Skie Silvershield and saw that the Hero of Baldurs Gate was covered in her blood. The corporal and his soldiers arrested the Bhaalspawn and took him back to trial in Baldurs Gate, for the crime of murder of a noble.
