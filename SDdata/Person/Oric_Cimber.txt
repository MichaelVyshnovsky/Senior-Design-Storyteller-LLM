'''Oric Cimber''' was the eldest son of the highwayman known as [[Scoril Cimber|Shadowhawk]].

==Description==
As the son of a bandit, Oric was strong and quick.

==Personality==
While Oric was physically powerful, he lacked the brains to be a successful bandit, such as remembering to search and disarm opponents of their weapons.

==History==
Around [[1335 DR]], Scoril Cimber the Shadowhawk tried to teach his ten year old son the tools of becoming a highwayman, but realized the boy was not cut out for that profession, so he turned to training Oric's younger brother, [[Artus Cimber|Artus]].
