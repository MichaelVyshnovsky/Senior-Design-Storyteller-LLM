        "mainbody": "'''Takenaka Sugawara''' was the hero of the [[Hojo War]] of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Sugawara led the [[Takenaka clan]] armies to victory in the Hojo War but after the end of the war in [[1349 DR]], he was unable to ascend to the position of [[shikken]] because of his lack of blood ties to the [[shogun]], a trait possessed instead by his half-brother, [[Takenaka Okawa]].\n\nSugawara retired to his estate in the [[Iwari province]], plotting a way to undermine Okawa and claim his position of ruler. Until then, he waited, recruiting allies.",
        "Personality": "Sugawara was slow to anger and never fought without a good reason, but when he had to act, he was swift and decisive. Sugawara was a great military leader, very popular among his subordinates."
