There, in the Dungeon Level after Kelim became lost, Halleth Garke accused Midna and her two remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so Midna and the other two beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a revenant in order to have vengeance. Unfortunately, he was unable to get out of the pit without help. If Halleth managed to have his vengeance, he finally died for good.\nMeanwhile, Midna decided to settle for a time inside the Arcane Chambers in a ruined laboratory where she managed to control the nine unseen servants living there.\nMidna searched a diplomatic solution only if she feared for her life.\nThe unseen servants obeyed Midna because they mistook her for their creator, a failed apprentice of Halaster."
