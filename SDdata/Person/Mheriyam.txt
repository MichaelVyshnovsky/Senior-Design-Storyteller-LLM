'''Mheriyam''' was a mercenary in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Mheriyam was a nervous person.

==Description==
Her [[leather armor]] was patched and worn.

==Possessions==
She carried at least two daggers.

==Abilities==
She was thought of as a thief. She wielded her two daggers at the same time.

==Relationships==
Together with [[Baergrim]] and [[Eltragar]], Mheriyam was part of the Blades.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, Eltragar, Mhaeriyam, and Baergrim were escorting the half-[[illithid]] [[wizard]] [[Mhulker]] in [[Undermountain]]. Mhulker was seeking a particular woman in order to eat her brain; he found her chained and gagged at an altar, but it turned out to be a trap, which Baergrim spotted by noticing that the woman's gag covered her nose too, meaning she couldn't breathe. After [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s trap slew Mhulker and the ancient wizard revealed himself, the mercenaries fled.
