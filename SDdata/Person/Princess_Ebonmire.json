        "mainbody": "Princess Ebonmire was a sentient black pudding follower of the Pudding King in Blingdenstone in the late 15 century DR.\nAt an unknown time, the black pudding devoured two spellbooks written by svirfneblin archmage Lesla Carrowil.\nThe Pudding King, an insane deep gnome fascinated by oozes, subjugated the black pudding, which he called Princess Ebonmire, and a gray ooze he called Prince Livid. Princess Ebonmire and Prince Livid always remained close to the Pudding King.\nCirca 1486 DR, after a great battle between the Pudding Kings ooze army and all the factions of Blingdenstone gathered together, Princess Ebonmire was killed just before its master by a party of adventurers hired by some deep gnome factions after escaping from drow slavers of Velkynvelve."
