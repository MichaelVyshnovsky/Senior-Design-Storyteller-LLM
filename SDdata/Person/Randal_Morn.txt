'''Randal Morn''' was the rightful heir of [[Daggerdale]] and had ruled as its Lord since [[1369 DR]] when he reclaimed it from [[Zhentarim]] control. As the last surviving member of the [[Morn]] family, he lived in exile as a vigilante for over thirty years before his return.

==Description==
Randal was of medium build, and was considered handsome with long brown hair.

==Skills==
He was, among his skills as a warrior and leader, an accomplished musician and singer.

==History==
The son of [[Flars Morn]] and [[Maerindra Elrproast]], Randal was named after his mother's grandsire. During his teenage years, both his parents were savagely slain by hireswords of the [[Zhents]] and Randal was rescued by [[Harpers]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]| topicid    = 3684| postid     = | whichpage  = 43| date       = 2013-06-07| accessdate = 2013-07-28}}

The Morn family had ruled over the [[Dalelands]] for centuries prior to the arrival of the Zhentarim. However, a flood of easily manipulated refugees from the destruction of [[Teshendale]] arrived, bringing along Zhentarim agents hidden in their midst. Sowing dissent and dissatisfaction with the Morn family, the Zhentarim was able to instigate a rebellion against the ruling Lordship.

The surviving heir to the family, Randal Morn, was driven from [[Dagger Falls]] by the Zhentarim agents in the {{YearlinkName|1336}}, and began his career as a vigilante resistance fighter. He and his two-hundred men would control up to three-quarters of Daggerdale, while the Zhentarim were only really interested in holding [[Dagger Falls]] and the surrounding area. During this time, he gained a great number of allies in the region and abroad, even once fighting alongside [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], Lord of [[Shadowdale]].<ref>

The first major victory occurred nearly two decades later with the death of the puppet ruler [[Malyk]] in the {{YearlinkName|1353}}. The Zhentarim responded aggressively, leading to a series of events that culminated in all-out civil war by [[1369 DR]].<ref> Morn finally reclaimed Dagger Falls and thus the region.

On [[Marpenoth 27]], the the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Randal Morn recruited a group of adventurers to stop the [[drow]] raids that had been occurring.

Randal Morn finally died in the {{YearlinkName|1391}}, after catching [[pneumonia]] on one of his celebrated hunting trips.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale}}

==Relations==
Randal was the last male heir to the Morn family. His sister, [[Silver Cormaeril]], lived to the south, having married into the [[Cormaeril]] family of [[Cormyr]]. Unless Morn produced an heir, control of Daggerdale would pass to the Cormaeril family upon his death.

==Relationships==
* [[Shree]], a human–[[doppelganger]] crossbreed and Morn's "intimate companion".{{cite book/The Seven Sisters|47}}
* [[Talath Hawksund]], a [[Harper]] ranger trained by [[Storm Silverhand]] and a one-time love interest of Morn's sister.
