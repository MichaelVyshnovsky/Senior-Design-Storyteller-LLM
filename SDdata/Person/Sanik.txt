'''Sanik''' was a trader and merchant who supplied [[Spellhold]] with their basic needs, as well as magical components.

==Description==
He was a merchant who spent time in the [[Vulgar Monkey]]. He was to be married to a courtesan named [[Claire]], and wished to find a way off of Brynnlaw.

==History==
In Brynnlaw, Sanik had met Claire, a courtesan of [[Galvena]]'s local guild. From here on, Claire was his wife-to-be, and the two were to escape Brynnlaw, giving up his duties supplying Spellhold. Galvena, however, was a harsh guildmistress, and considered all of her members as her property. She accused Sanik of theft, and let the whole island know of this.

[[Gorion's Ward]] confronted him about trading with Spellhold while he sought a way in to rescue [[Imoen]]. During this encounter, Sanik was assassinated by a member of Galvena's guild.
