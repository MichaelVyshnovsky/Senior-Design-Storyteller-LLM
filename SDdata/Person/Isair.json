        "mainbody": "'''Isair''' was a [[cambion]] [[wizard]] who lead the [[Legion of the Chimera]], along with his sister [[Madae]], during the early 14<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Isair was described to be a twisted [[sorcerer]] with as much power as any master of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]].\n\nBeing half-[[elf]] and half-[[devil]], Isair had typical elven and devilish characteristics. He was about six and a half feet tall, and stood on two legs. He had dark red skin, broad, leathery wings, twisted legs, and a tail. Isair was a powerful [[wizard]] with [[fighter]] training, and fought off his enemies with two large [[scimitar]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Little of Isair's equipment was known. Upon his defeat, his body was dragged into the [[Limbo]] Plane, and his equipment with him. It was most likely that Isair carried a [[Scimitar of Souls (replica)|greater version]] of [[Iyachtu Xvim]]'s [[Scimitar of Souls|scimitar]].",
        "History": "Isair and his twin sister, [[Madae]], were born in the a small house, to the west of [[Kuldahar]]'s [[Broken Tower (Kuldahar Pass)|watchtower]], in [[1282 DR]]. With the [[archdruid]] [[Iselore]]'s help, they were born to an elf, [[Ilmadia Bariel|Ilmadia]], who had become pregnant with the devil, [[Belhifet]]. He was named after Iselore's father. To his mother's surprise, he was born with twisted legs. After the villages revolted against them, he and his sister escaped to [[Luskan]]. Here, they made contact with Luskan's [[Arcane Brotherhood]], and became emissaries to the [[Abyss]]al Plane.\n\nThe twins met their father upon their maturity and fought for him in the [[Nine Hells]], but still received discrimination. Therefore, the two returned to [[Faer√ªn]]. Isair and his sister were disgusted about they way they were treated for being half-breeds. Due to this, he and Madae went to form the [[Legion of the Chimera]] ''circa'' [[1306 DR]], their motivation being equality for half-breeds. After they were disrespected by the [[Ten Towns]], Isair did not find it endearing, and sent his armies out to war.\n\nLater in [[1312 DR]], he and Madae were confronted by an adventuring band and fought them in a raging battle. After their stronghold, [[Severed Hand]], collapsed, he was dragged into the [[Limbo|plane of Limbo]], and had not been reported back since."
