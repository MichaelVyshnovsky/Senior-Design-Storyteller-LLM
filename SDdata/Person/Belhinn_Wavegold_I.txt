King '''Belhinn Wavegold I''' "the Hidden," originally '''Helgrin Wavegold''', was the second [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Wavegold]] dynasty.

==Relationships==
Belhinn I was the son of [[Belhinn Wavegold|Belhinn]], and grandson of King [[Erdhinn Wavegold I|Erdhinn I]]. His sons included [[Rhinn Wavegold|Rhinn]] and [[Erdhinn Wavegold II|Erdhinn II]], and had [[Gelhinn Wavegold|Gelhinn]] and [[Belhinn Wavegold II|Belhinn II]] for grandsons.

==History==
Helgrin unexpectedly inherited the throne at age 4 in the {{YearlinkName|1115}}, when his father Belhinn and grandfather King Erdhinn I died. He was hidden and protected by the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Herald]] [[Thultar Mornhelm]], who acted as his regent, and King [[Proster Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]], who received general trade concessions in return.

He finally became king at age 16 in the {{YearlinkName|1127}}, having taken the regnal name Belhinn I.
