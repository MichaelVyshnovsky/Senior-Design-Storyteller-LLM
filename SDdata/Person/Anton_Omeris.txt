'''Anton Omeris''' was the guild registrar of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As to be expected, Anton was quite knowledgeable about the process of forming a guild that was officially recognized by [[Lord Neverember]] and the city's government.

==Activities==
Anton operated out of the [[Hall of Justice]] in [[Protector's Enclave]], working with adventuring parties who were looking to form a more formal arrangement for their organization.
