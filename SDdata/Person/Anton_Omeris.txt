Anton Omeris was the guild registrar of Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
As to be expected, Anton was quite knowledgeable about the process of forming a guild that was officially recognized by Lord Neverember and the citys government.
Anton operated out of the Hall of Justice in Protectors Enclave, working with adventuring parties who were looking to form a more formal arrangement for their organization.
