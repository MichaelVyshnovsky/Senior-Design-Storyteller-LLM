        "mainbody": "'''Nalifarn''' was an [[durzagon]] alchemist and chieftain around [[1485 DR]].",
        "History": "Nalifarn led a clan of [[duergar]]. In 1485 DR, he was approached by the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]], who offered an alliance with his [[Red Wizard]] masters. Nalifarn accepted and, with the Red Wizards' help, took control of the [[Firehammer Hold]]. In exchange, the durzagon started manufacturing weapons for the [[Thayan]]s. Nalifarn planned to make the Hold a permanent duergar outpost.\n\nLater, he was killed by an adventuring party hired to search for [[Jekk Ironfist]]."
