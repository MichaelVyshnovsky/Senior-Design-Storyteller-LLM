        "mainbody": "'''Cymril''' was a [[Harper agent]] who operated out of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "When the [[Harpers]] of Neverwinter decided to support the [[Sons of Alagondar]]'s rebellion, as they saw [[Dagult Neverember]] as an oppressive opportunist who wanted to use the city to expand his mercantile empire in the [[Sword Coast North]], they sent Cymril to join the rebels and take up the leadership of the group. Under Cymril, the Sons of Alagondar's actions were non-violent but annoying in nature by creating minor sabotages, stealing supplies, and embarrassing the [[Mintarn]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] hired by the [[New Neverwinter]] organization.\n\nCymril was also an ally of the \"[[Aron Vishter|Fisher]]\".\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], mounting reprisals against the Sons of Alagondar, Neverember's actions resulted in the death of Cymril.",
        "Legacy": "Cymril's death was a huge blow against the rebels, as it created a power vacuum within the Sons and the disorganization caused internal conflict, leading to the splitting of the group into two opposing factions: the [[Sons of Alagondar#The Nashers|Nashers]] and the [[Sons of Alagondar#The Graycloaks|Graycloaks]]. \n\nBecause of the revelation that Cymril was a double agent working for Neverember, the Harpers experienced a setback in the region as their relationship with the Sons of Alagondar had become strained, and their reputation in Neverwinter was damaged, at least for a time.",
        "Rumors": "Some believed Cymril had faked her death to advance her own agenda, however there was no proof for those rumors, and not even the other Harpers of Neverwinter knew about what secret agenda Cymril may have had. Some believed she was really working for the [[Thay]]ans, the [[Shadovar]], or [[Bregan D'aerthe]] to undermine the Harpers of Neverwinter, while others believed she was actually a thrall of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]."
