        "mainbody": "aazka was the powerful pit fiend responsible for the Second Dragonspear War of the midâ€“14 century DR, that later allied with the Red Wizards of Thay in Daggerford circa the .\nWhile he originated from the Nine Hells, Baazka was one of the leaders of the devils that gained control of Dragonspear Castle in the 14 century. He led the fiendish horde in the Second Dragonspear War of 1363 DR.\nHowever, at the end of that conflict Baazka was pierced with the magic sword Illydrael by a cleric of Tempus. Smote through the heart but not yet dead he escaped into the gate as it was on the verge of closing and returned to the Hells. Baazka had risked all, as if the sword had kill him while on Toril, he could have come back in a century, but if it had killed him in the Hells, he would have died for good. Baazka survived but was afraid to move the sword while he was in the Hells. He also couldnt return to Toril until the gate closed by \"Illydrael\" remained inactive.\nIn 1485 DR, the Dragonspear gate reopened and Baazka returned in a ghostly state. In this state he tried to possess the Red Wizard Mennek Ariz but failed and Mennek alerted his superiors. Thus Baazka bargained with Szass Tam to help the Red Wizards in exchange for their help in freeing him from the swords curse. Baazka chose Bloodgate Keep as the perfect hideout for the Thayans experiments. He also corrupted Shalendra Floshin and had her help the Red Wizards in their project and as a contingency plan when the Red Wizards inevitably betrayed him.\nIn 1486 DR, when the heroes of Daggerford marched to Bloodgate he plotted to help them in exchange for their help with the sword, obviously tricking them."
