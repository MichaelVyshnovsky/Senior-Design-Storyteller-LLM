Thantan Rhyrdyl was one of the leaders (a Boars Head) of the Order of the Blue Boar, a mercenary recruitment company in Amn.
Thantan was charismatic to the point of seeming arrogant.
He was the battlefield leader of the Order. He was a very cabable cavalry officer.
Hailing from a wealthy Amnian merchant family, Thantan in his youth formed his well-armed and armored private mercenary cavalry company, and left the family business. While disappointed in this, his family did not disown him.
