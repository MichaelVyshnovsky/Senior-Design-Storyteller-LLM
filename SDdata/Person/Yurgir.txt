'''Yurgir''' was an [[orthon]] mercenary fought in the [[Blood War]] alongside other [[devil]]s of the [[Nine Hells]], against the [[demon]]s of the [[Abyss]]. He unfortunately became trapped on the world of [[Toril]] on the [[Prime Material plane]] for much of the 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faer√ªnian calendar]].

Chances are many more graves than yours alone will soon be fed.<br />

==Description==
Like other orthons, Yurgir was mighty in stature and presence. He had red skin that was hardened over with black scales along his forearms. He had three pairs of twisted horns that extended from the crown and rear of his head.

Yurgir wore plated leg armor and a single shoulder guard that appeared to be crafted from [[infernal iron]], along with a cap and loin cloth that were adorned with engraved, [[humanoid]] skulls.

==Personality==
Yurgir was supremely confident in his abilities as a warrior and mercenary. He appeared to have attained a significant reputation among the devils of the [[Nine Hells]]. The orthon also admired other capable warriors and respected those play fair in a competitive way.  Despite this, Yurgir remained exceptionally frustrated with his circumstances following a bargain he made that went terribly wrong, and he would revenge on those wrong him badly. 

==Abilities==

The consumate warrior of the Nine Hells, Yurgir possessed numerous abilities that gave him the edge in mortal combat. He could turn himself ''[[Invisibility|invisbile at will]]'' and strike out at his foes with an infernal dagger coated with potent [[poison]]. 

Yurgir utilized a number of [[grenade]]s and other projectiles that released blasts of concussive or pure explosive energy.

He was resistant to all forms of physical harm, was protected from both fire and extreme cold, and could not be easily poisoned himself.

==Possessions==
Yurgir wielded powerful weapons of war that originated from the [[Lower Planes]], including a ''[[hellfire hand crossbow]]'' and ''[[orthonic handbomb]]s''.

He accumulated a small hoard of recovered items, most of which he passed on to one of his merrogon followers. He also stashed away an ''[[umbral gem]]'' near his bed of skulls.

==Activities==
{{Quote|Asking why doesn't get me paid - hunting and killing does.|Yurgir.}}

Like other orthons, Yurgir was a soldier and mercenary through and through. He did not question the orders he received, but merely followed them out and received payment.

Yurgir's unwanted sojourn on Toril was the result of the [[infernal contract]] he with the [[cambion]] named [[Raphael]]. Due to the fiend's manipulations, Yurgir was unable to fulfill his end of the bargain and remained unable to leave The Prime.

==Relationships==
Yurgir led a contingent of [[merregon]]s, who followed his every command, even if it were to kill each of their own kind. He also had a pet [[displacer beast]] named [[Nessa (displacer beast)|Nessa]].

Yurgir had an unpleasant relationship with the devil [[Raphael]]. they did not see eye to eye even before the contract. Yurgir expressed strong hatred towards Rapahel using contract to trap him for a century and the contract song installed in his head.

==History==
{{Quote|
Spill all the blood sworn to the night,<br />
Silence all prayers; smother each rite,<br />
Wander Shar's halls; hungry to slay,<br />
Leave no Justiciar alive to obey,<br />
Leave none to hear it, then be set free;<br />
This song is your oath, swear, swear it to me.<br />
|Yurgir's contract.}}

At some point in his life, Yurgir once killed a warlord from the continent of [[Kara-Tur]]. The mighty orthon then proceeded to his mistresses and his children and crafted a delightful codpiece from the man's skull.

On another occasion, he met a [[dusk hag]] who envisioned some future reality where Yurgir spared her life.

Some time ''circa'' the late 14{{th}} century DR, Yurgir signed a contract with Raphael to kill all the [[Dark Justiciars]] of [[Shar]] within her Gauntlet. Unfortunately, the justiciar named [[Lyrthindor]] utilized one of Raphael's ''[[One Becomes Many|own writings]]'' to transform himself into an entire colony of [[rat]]s. This act of depraved subterfuge prevented Yurgir from completing his charge. 

Unable to complete his contract, Yurgir remained trapped within Shar's Gauntlet, his only other options were to die on the Prime or forfeit his freedom and become Raphael's eternal servant. It appeared that Raphael purposefully allowed Lyrthindor to learn the means by which to escape Yurgir's wrath.

While Yurgir did not remember the exact specifics, it appears Raphael had intended to pursue to the [[Deva (aasimar)|aasimar]] [[Aylin]], who was trapped in an area of the [[Shadowfell]] accessible by Shar's Gauntlet.
