'''Ulraen''' of [[Eltabbar]] was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] during the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ulraen slew [[Veldribold]] of [[Calimport]] in {{yearlink|1322}}, shortly after the latter finally managed to bring down [[Phelandern Ghemelt]], the [[Magister]]. He was mid-gloat when he was savaged by two other challengers' summoned monsters.
