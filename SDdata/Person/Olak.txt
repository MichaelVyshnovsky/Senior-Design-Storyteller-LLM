'''Sentinel Olak''' was a [[goblin]] warrior and lookout that helped guard the [[Shattered Sanctum]], one of the outposts of the [[cult of the Absolute]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Lookit, [[Klaw]]! Supper's here!|Olak, at local travelers.}}

==Description==
Olak wore a suit of modified [[chainmail]] armor, adorned with leather scraps and bones. He also bore the ''[[mark of the Absolute]]''.

==Personality==
Rather than attack non-[[goblin]]s on sight, Olak preferred to berate and threaten anyone that dared approach him.

==Relationships==
He had a "pet" [[worg]] named [[Klaw]].

==History==
Unfortunately, Olak did not participate in the celebration following his band's raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]]. He had guard duty at the outpost just outside the Shattered Sanctum.
