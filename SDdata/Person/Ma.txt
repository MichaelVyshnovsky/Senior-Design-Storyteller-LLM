Ma was a barkeep in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Ma was loyal to her customers and staff but for some gold she agreed to talk. She had a raspy voice after a half-century of smoking a pipe. Ma seldom cursed but possessed a forthright honest and a homespun wit.
In 1491 DR, Ma managed the bar called the Black Blade and Bloody Boar in a lower part of the city.
