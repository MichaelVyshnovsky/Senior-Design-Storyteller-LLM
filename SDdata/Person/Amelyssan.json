        "mainbody": "'''Amelyssan the Blackhearted''', also known as '''Melissan''',  was the most calculating and seemingly devoted [[priestess]] of the deity [[Bhaal]], a follower whom he entrusted with the task of his divine resurrection.",
        "Description": "While she took on the form of a fair, demure woman of plain appearance and steady disposition, Amelyssan viewed herself as so much more. When she seized the power of [[Throne of Blood|Bhaal's throne]], Amelyssan emerged as a massive warrior of great potency.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|The Servant of [[Bhaal]] knows death and destruction,<br />The face of an ally, the mask of a foe.|A forest spirit at the [[Grove of the Ancients]].}}<br/>\nAmelyssan was capable of convincingly pretending that her greatest desire was to help other people to the point of masking her [[alignment|moral and ethical outlook]] to others as that of pure [[lawful good|dutiful benevolence]]. In truth, she was psychotic and irredeemably [[evil]]. Amelyssan was a megalomaniacal and remorseless killer that regarded others, even her [[deity|god]], as nothing but mere tools. She had little tolerance for others trying to limit her will in any form, believing that she was already a goddess that should be treated accordingly.",
        "Possessions": "In her nearly-divine form, Amelyssan wielded an enormous [[military fork]] that was was longer than most men.",
        "Activities": "Amelyssan served as one of Bhaal's [[deathstalker]]s, an order of fervent [[assassin]]s associated with his [[church of Bhaal|clergy]]. In the years following Bhaal's death she masqueraded as one of his half-divine children, one whose altruism was directed at sparing her fellow outcast siblings from the harshness of the world.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|I am no dead thing! You have called a piece of a living goddess to you.}}<br/>\nWhile the assertion that Amelyssan was a god was nothing but wishful thinking on her part, she was nonetheless immensely powerful. She was proficient in both [[divine]] and [[arcane magic]], spellcasting that was only increased in power with the more Bhaalspawn essences she consumed. \n\nAt its apex, her power rivaled that of a [[demigod]]; she could nearly simultaneously summon otherworldly beings to her aid, while striking foes with her massive military fork. She had become immune to the elements and other forms of harmful energy, could resist physical harm and was even not affected by some ''[[time stop|time-altering magic]]''.",
        "History": {
            "Siege of Saradush": "[[File:Melissan_small.jpg|left]]\nUnder the guise of Melissan, attempted to lead some citizens of the [[Tethyr]]ian settlement of [[Saradush]] to safety, as the city was under siege by an army of [[fire giant]]s. She sought to gain audience with [[Gromnir Il-Khan]], the city's [[half-orc]] ruler and surviving Bhaalspawn. As Melissan and the townspeople were nearly struck down by Gromnir's guards, another Bhaalspawn [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions were ''[[teleport]]ed'' into the city from a [[Pocket Plane|portion]] of [[Bhaal]]s [[Throne of Bhaal|divine realm]]. Along with the newly-arrived adventurer, Melissan was able to confront Gromnir within his palace, casting away his misgivings, and ensure his death â€“ providing herself with another small portion of Bhaal's divine essence.\n\n[[File:Bhaalspawn Crisis.png|thumb|right|400px|''A battlefield formed by the [[Bhaalspawn|crisis]] orchestrated by Amelyssan.'']]\nMelissan then convinced Abdel to defeat [[Yaga-Shura]], the Bhaalspawn general that commanded the fire giants besieging Saradush. While the hero managed to remove Yaga-Shura's magical invulnerability and then slay him, Saradush was left to ruin and many of the Bhaalspawn trapped within were dead. Melisan remain unscathed, yet troubled enough by the catastrophe to convince Abdel Adrian that other members of the Five must be stopped, lest the tragedy of Saradush befall another city. Under Melissan's direction, the Bhaalspawn from [[Baldur's Gate]] set out across Tethyr and slew two more members of the Five, the [[drow]] sorceress [[Sendai]], and the [[blue dragon]] [[Abazigal]], then set out to reunite with her in the [[Calishite]] mountain village of [[Amkethran]].",
            "Final Act of Treachery": "{{Quote|Remain dust, my foolish god.|Amelyssan the Blackhearted.}}<br/>\nWhile in Amkethran, Amelyssan's true nature was uncovered by the final living member of the Five, the [[monk]] [[Balthazar]]. He imprisoned her within his monastery, not taken in by her promises of power. He planned to kill the remaining Bhaalspawn himself then take his own life, ensuring both her scheme and that of Bhaal would never come to fruition. Fortunately for Amelyssan, Abdel and his companions found their way into the monastery and battled the righteous monk in his throne room, in a vicious struggle for their own survival. With nearly all the Bhaalspawn dead, Abdel was whisked away by his patron [[solar]] and Amelyssan was granted the essence of one of the most powerful of Bhaal's children.\n\nJust before Amelyssan was set to claim what remained of the [[Throne of Blood]], her mortal form was summoned by the solar and presented in front of Abdel and the divine being within the shard of Bhaal's realm. The true history of the former Deathstalker was presented as witness before the Bhaalspawn, as well as an [[avatar]] of Bhaal himself. When presented with his fury over her delay, Amelyssan stood defiant in front of her former god.\n\nArmed with the Bhaalspawn essence of all but two of the dead god's children, Amelyssan confronted Abdel Adrian and his companions at the [[Mana Forge]] in [[the Abyss]]. Requiring time to fully absorb the collected essences, she summoned forth great [[demon]]s such as [[succubi]], [[glabrezu]]s and [[marilith]]s, undead monstrosities like [[death tyrant]]s and [[bone fiend]]s, and even a [[fallen solar]]. Amelyssan also called upon immensely powerful extra-planar beings to protect her during the battle, including the [[archomental]] [[Yan-C-Bin]], from the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], and [[Cryonax]] from the para-elemental plane of [[Frostfell (plane)|Frostfell]].\n\n[[File:Amelyssan Mana Forge.png|thumb|right|500px|''Amelyssan confronted with the full power of Bhaal's children at the [[Mana Forge]]''.]]",
            "The Fall": "{{Quote|You are no god, priestess of Bhaal. You play with stolen energies that make you immortal, that give you great power...but that does not make you a god.|[[Solar]]. }}<br/>\nThe mustering of fiends and other-worldly allies was not enough. Abdel Adrian and his allies defeated Amelyssan in an epic and decisive battle on the platforms of the Mana Forge, floating across the [[Astral Plane]]. While the mortal adventurers could not kill the immortal Amelyssan, the same solar that had presented her true face to Bhaal declared the contest for Bhaal's divinity was over, as decided by the gods themselves. The pretender's divine essences were stripped and presented to the surviving Bhaalspawn to do with what he wished,",
            "The Echo": "[[File:Murder tribunal.png|thumb|''Amelyssan, Illasera, and Sendai, with Sarevok on the Tribunal's throne.''|450x450px]]\n{{quote|''I am Amelyssan the Blackhearted. I stood as Bhaal's high priestess - his eternal succour. Until I sought to usurp him... It was my triumph to die among the stars, in the Astral Plane. It was a fine death. Perhaps the best.''|Echo of Amelyssan}}<br/>\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, a collection of Bhaalspawn: Amelyssan, [[Abazigal]], [[Illasera]], and [[Sendai]], were brought back as bloodied echoes of their former selves by [[Sarevok Anchev]], placing them on the [[Murder Tribunal]], hidden deep within [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Undercellar]], in the ruins of the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Temple of Bhaal]]."
