'''Koravis''' was the [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[raven]] companion of [[Bane]], the [[god]] of tyranny.

==Description==
Koravis was a tiny bird with sharp claws.

==Abilities==
He was swift and deadly with his claws, and possessed the ability to ''[[smite good]]'' once each day. He was highly resilient to attacks&mdash;and even more so against [[fire]] and cold&mdash;assuming that a foe could even land a blow on the highly evasive raven.

Koravis had keen senses, including [[darkvision]].

==Relationships==
Bane and Koravis could speak to each other and were connected by both an [[Empathy|empathic link]] and a powerful blood bond, which enhanced the raven's might and skill whenever he witnessed any threat or harm to Bane. The raven's reflexes, will, and fortitude were also closely tied to those of the dark god.

==History==
Koravis was known to accompany Bane as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]],
