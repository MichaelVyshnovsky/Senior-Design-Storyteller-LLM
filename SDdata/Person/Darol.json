        "mainbody": "Darol was a young nobleman from Cormyr circa 1357 DR who was present at the wedding of Gaylyn Wyvernspur and Frefford Wyvernspur.\nIn 1357 DR, tipsy Minda was unwittingly instrumental in the assassination attempt on Giogioni Wyvernspurs life during the wedding reception. She continuously asked and goaded Giogi to do his famous imitation of King Azoun Obarskyr IV. He did. It triggered the assassins magical azure bonds, forcing Alias to attack the source of Azouns voice.\nOne of the guests, Darol, received a slash to his face when he was trying to impress the young noblewoman by unsuccessfully stopping the assassin. This made Minda swoon over him, to Giogis disappointment. Darol later was given permission to accompany Mindas carriage back to Suzail."
