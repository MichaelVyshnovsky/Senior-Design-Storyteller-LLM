        "mainbody": "Ruldarr was a shopkeeper and the owner of Ruldarrs Pipes, Locks, Tobacco, and Fine Furniture in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nRuldarr had a well-kept appearance with a small pointed beard and an oiled mustache.\nHe was a man of grace and refined manners, with a subtle humor. He was also a keen gardener and had a taste for exotic wines, which he often shared with guests. Among them was the bitter and salted black wine of Phelzol, a distinctly acquired taste that he had clearly acquired.\nHis house stood at the southeastern edge of the upper part of the settlement, at the end of the street called the Black and standing beside Haeleths house and opposite The Bargewright Inn itself.\nHis plants took up much of the room in his house and shop, many of them hanging plants in large, levitating pots. They rose and moved at Ruldarrs direction, or simply drifted about on their own, with leaves and roots dangling in the air. These plants seemed to enjoy Ruldarrs wines as well, and if a guest poured their unwanted wine into one, they would find several thirsty potplants hovering around wanting some too."
