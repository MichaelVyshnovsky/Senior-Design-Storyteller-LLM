'''Alkazaar''' was a famous 14{{th}} century explorer and author who traveled the Realms and wrote about his adventures for others to enjoy.

==Description==
As described in his writings, Alkazaar was said to be a handsome man who kept a distinguishing moustache. He had impeccable style, choosing to wear loose-fitting shirts, well-polished polished boots, [[trousers]] that were a bit-too-tight, and a dashing hat.

==Activities==
During his life Alkazaar traveled far and wide across [[Faer√ªn]], earning great acclaim and recognition far and wide. He wrote of his adventures in the massive and widely-beloved autobiography, ''[[Alkazaar's Thrilling Tales]]'', and the much-shorter supplemental work ''[[Alkazaar's Appendix]]''.

==History==
After many years of travels, Alkazaar eventually set out on one final adventurer, traveling to [[Anauroch]] in order to recover one of the fabled ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''. While traversing the desert, Alkazaar encountered an [[Sapphire Sentinel|ancient stone golem]], gaining its trust and a new traveling companion. The explored garnered a possible location of interest from some of the desert's native [[Bedine]] people, but the expedition was halted when his traveling group was dispersed by a devastating sandstorm.

In the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, Alkazaar traveled to [[Candlekeep]] on the [[Sword Coast]] and gained admittance into the library-fortress with copies of his famous autobiography, and its much shorter addition. He regaled the [[monk]]s of the [[Avowed]] with stories of his travels, the memories of which many of them cherished for decades.

Within the appendix of his famous book, Alkazaar included a magical ''[[portal|picture portal]]'' that could be activated by the right individuals, along with coded [[command word]]s that would allow for its activation.
