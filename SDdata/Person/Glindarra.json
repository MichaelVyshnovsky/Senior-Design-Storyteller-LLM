        "mainbody": "Glindarra was a girl who lived in Tarmalune, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in the late years of the 15th century DR.\nGlindarra was a thin and young human female.\nGlindarra seem to be linked in some form to the god Amaunator. When she was 10, she usually drew Amaunators holy symbol or embroidered it in her clothes, unconscious of what she was doing and what that symbol really meant.\nGlindarra was born in Ramekho in 1469 DR. Her parents died of plague in 1471 DR, and her grandparent Rathloff cared for her since then.\nIn 1479 DR, Glindarra met a group of adventurers who were searching for clues about the Cult of Reborn Flame, and convinced them to meet with her grandfather.\nIn 1480 DR, she was taken as a hostage by Pyrultimus, to force Rathloff to help him to finish his ritual to awaken the primordial Achazar. Her grandmother, Halagothra the Healer of Tarmalune, was able to save her and took care of her since then."
