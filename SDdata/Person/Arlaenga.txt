Arlaenga was one of the servants in Lord Marstens hunting lodge.
Arlaenga was the head maid for Lord Marsten until, some time before the Tyranny of Dragons, her master was killed and the lodge occupied by Cult of the Dragon agents under Talis Kasterel. She decided to use Arlaenga and the other servants as her own. Arlaenga hoped to show her loyalty to the new masters by spying on things she found suspicious.
