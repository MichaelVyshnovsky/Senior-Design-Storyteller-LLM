        "mainbody": "'''Liantor Stoneborn''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[adventurer]] who worked in [[Cormyr]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "Description": "Liantor was a stout dwarven fellow with short brown hair and a beard. He wore a suit of [[plate armor]] and carried a wicked [[dwarven waraxe]].",
        "History": "Sometime around the time of the [[Darkening]], Liantor and his companions [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Tristran of Daggerford]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], [[Popkin Shortshanks]], and [[Helayna]] discovered an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient tomb]] at the bottom of a crevasse in the [[Stonelands]]. They first fought their way past some [[undead]] inhabitants, then discovered a secret passage leading further underground. After passing into a larger, deeper cave system, the group was ambushed by militant [[Clan Daeronnax]] [[kobold]]s, who were able to overcome the group and separate them. While everyone else was trapped in the caves, the quick-footed sneak Popkin managed to escape back to [[Eveningstar]] to get assistance. Unfortunately for Liantor, he was caught and killed by a team of kobolds before help could arrive, though his companions survived to be rescued."
