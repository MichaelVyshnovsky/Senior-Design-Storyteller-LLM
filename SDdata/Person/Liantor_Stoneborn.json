        "mainbody": "Liantor Stoneborn was a dwarven adventurer who worked in Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.\nLiantor was a stout dwarven fellow with short brown hair and a beard. He wore a suit of plate armor and carried a wicked dwarven waraxe.\nSometime around the time of the Darkening, Liantor and his companions Jarus Brithandir, Tristran of Daggerford, Kirina Aelorothi, Popkin Shortshanks, and Helayna discovered an ancient tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands. They first fought their way past some undead inhabitants, then discovered a secret passage leading further underground. After passing into a larger, deeper cave system, the group was ambushed by militant Clan Daeronnax kobolds, who were able to overcome the group and separate them. While everyone else was trapped in the caves, the quick-footed sneak Popkin managed to escape back to Eveningstar to get assistance. Unfortunately for Liantor, he was caught and killed by a team of kobolds before help could arrive, though his companions survived to be rescued."
