Janszobur was a barbarian who could be found wandering Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Originally from the Snow Cat Nomads, Janszobur undertook a quest to find a warrior-priestess who, according to his tribes legends, would lead them to greatness. He was drunk most of the time while wandering Waterdeep, but would eagerly enlist the help of any willing strangers he stumbled upon.
