{{Quote|Hunger is one of the great trials.|St. Liwan}}
'''St. Liwan''' was a saint of the [[Church of Ilmater]] and the patron of the [[House of St. Liwan's Blessing]].

St. Liwan's teachings focused on food and diet and the peaceful effect they had on people. His followers would not only feed the hungry; they insisted on providing the best food possible as a means of bringing satisfaction from want. Liwan believed that even war could be eradicated if all people everywhere were well-fed.
