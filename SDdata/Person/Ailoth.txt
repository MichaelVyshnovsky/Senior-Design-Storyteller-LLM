Ailoth () was an diviner and an agent of the Red Wizards of Thay for Sembia and Hillsfar. He was part of Alzegunds network.
Ailoth was a white-haired magic-user.
Not overly intelligent, Ailoths activities as a spy did not go unnoticed by the governments of Sembia and Hillsfar who were aware to his true work.
The Red Wizard arrived in Sembia around 1337 DR. After some time Ailoth broke with Alzegund to start a private business, but this was a facade to cover his work as a Thayan spy under his master.
In 1357 DR, Ailoth was known as a moneylender and the buyer of thieves goods. In truth, he was gathering information from a network of spies and giving information to his master when he and Alzegund were in the same city.
