        "History": "Like his fellow dukes, Belt was taken in by the young and charismatic politician [[Sarevok Anchev]], during the events of the [[iron crisis]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. However, unlike Dukes [[Eltan]] and [[Entar Silvershield]], Belt came out of the events without suffering great personal harm.\n\nIn [[Uktar]] of that year, the [[War of the Shining Crusade]] threatened the entirety of the [[Sword Coast]]. Duke Belt and the rest of the Council offered their support to the growing [[Coalition]] army, which comprised soldiers from Baldur's Gate, [[Daggerford]], and [[Waterdeep]].\n\nAfter the war, the young noblewoman [[Skie Silvershield]] was murdered in cold blood – a heinous crime that was attributed to the Hero of Baldur's Gate, [[Abdel Adrian]]. Duke Belt presided over Adrian's public trial, held in front of the [[Flaming Fist]]'s city keep.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Duke Belt's memory lived on with his [[Belt (family)|descendants]]. They had enjoyed the benefits of being one of the city's wealthy [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|patriar families]]."
