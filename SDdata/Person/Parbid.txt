Parbid was a tiefling Shadovar monk and a member of Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun and the Brothers of the Gray Mists in the 15 century DR.
He was the fighting partner and companion of Afafrenfere, a human Shadovar monk.
He used a spear in combat.
Parbid was hired in secret by Effron the Twisted, along with several other members of Cavus Dun, to capture Dahlia Sinfelle and eliminate her companion Drizzt DoUrden. Effron conspired in a secret plot to capture Dahlia to fulfill his personal vendetta and gain prestige with the Netherese Lord Draygo Quick, without Herzgo Alegni.
Parbid was killed by Drizzt DoUrden, with a lightning arrow from Drizzts bow Taulmaril during Cavus Duns failed attempt on Dahlia Sinfelle in the woods of Neverwinter.
