'''Osi Tchaluka''' was a member and a majordomo of [[Sa'Sani]]'s merchant organization that operated in [[Samarach]] and the [[Sword Coast]] in the late  14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|Capable enough as a bookkeeper and manager of ledgers, certainly - I shall give him that. But as a leader of Samargol's largest merchant organization? It is blood in the water - and the sharks will reach him soon enough. I might feel sorry for him, if the situation did not infuriate me so.|[[Nas'Sirin]]}}

==Description==
Osi was a friendly yet diligent young man with brown hair and dusky skin. His body language betrayed his alertness and eagerness to impress his superiors.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Osi Tchaluka worked under Sa'Sani's direct management. She put the young man in charge of many of the company's daily activities, maintenance of ledgers, record-keeping, and exchange of [[trade bar]]s for [[coin]]. The man was eager to impress his mistress and followed her every command. When a fellow merchant company member [[Luaire Farwander]] was revealed to be a dreaded [[yuan-ti]], Sa'Sani was forced to flee to the Sword Coast, leaving eager Osi Tchaluka in command of the Samarachan business.
