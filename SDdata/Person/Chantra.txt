'''Chantra''' was a sales clerk who worked at [[Elhazir's Exotica]] in [[Arabel]] in [[1368 DR]].

==Description==
Chantra wore clothing to make her appear as a regular citizen and not the skilled [[wizard]] that she actually was.

==Activities==
In addition to accommodating paying customers, Chantra was adept at spying [[thieves]] who entered the store. In the event that she failed to identify one of these miscreants before they made a grab for the store's property, Chantra always had the use of her ''[[time stop]]'' spell to correct any issues with theft.

==Relationships==
Chantra was one of six daughters of the store's owner, [[Elhazir]].

==Possessions==
Chantra wore an amulet that shielded her mind from magical and [[psionics|psionic]] intrusions.
