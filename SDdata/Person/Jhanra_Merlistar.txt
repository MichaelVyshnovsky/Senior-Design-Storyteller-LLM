Jhanra Merlistar was an aquatic elf High Mage in Myth Nantar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She was on the clan of Merlistar.
In , Jhanra was accepted as a new student by the High Mages of SeluMaraar, Taranath Reefglamor and Yrlimn Tidark, as were Talor Vurtalis and Keryth Adofaer and four others. After they demonstrated a talent for the fundamentals of High Magic, in , Taranath placed three selukiira on the foreheads of the three students, which put them into years-long comas as they absorbed millennia worth of knowledge. All remained secluded within their estate on the edge of Sylkiir.
Jhanra and her fellows were awakened from reverie only 23 years later, on first day of the month of Eadersong of , in order to help in the Twelfth Serôs War. They had full powers of High Mages and were taught the legends of the Ravager.Sea of Fallen Stars page 73 says this is "after thirteen years", but the dates show 23 years have passed. The discrepancy seems to be based on a misreading of the years, but maybe they were woken up briefly after ten years, perhaps at the switch from coma to reverie.
Jhanra and her fellows helped their masters in the war and in the great spell that sent Iakhovas to the Outer Planes. After Yrlimn and Taranath died, Talor, Keryth, and Jhanra replaced them as the new High Mages, serving fully by .
Jhanra was a magical prodigy—though the youngest of the three new High Mages, at only 225 years old, she had the instinct for magic of elves thrice her age.
In addition to her regular duties, Jhanra spent most of her time aiding the merfolk at the Stadium of Tavynos whod been hurt and displaced by the war and teaching their children. She believed it was possible to teach them wizards magic, despite claims they were incapable, and that this was only because the Aryselmalyn elves had always forbidden it.
In contrast to all the High Mages, she felt the most comfortable with all the non-elves in the city.
