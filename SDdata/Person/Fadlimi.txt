'''"Fadlimi"''' was a [[doppelganger]] [[assassin]] working for the [[Sons of Gondegal]] bandit gang in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1370s [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|48}}

==Description==
Fadlimi posed as a young and beautiful [[human]] woman of slender build and dark hair.

==Activities==
Using this guise in [[Suzail]], Fadlimi plied a retired scout of the [[Purple Dragons]], [[Ingo Siegur]], for information, by getting the old man to become infatuated with her and persistently asking for tales of his military career. In this way, Fadlimi learned Purple Dragons tactics, formations, sites of caches of supplies and weapons, passwords. Armed with this intelligence, Fadlimi and the Sons of Gondegal had ambitious plans to infiltrate the [[King's Forest]] and from there conquer [[Arabel]].
