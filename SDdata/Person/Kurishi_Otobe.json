Even during most meetings with business partners, she tended to remain hidden in the shadows.\nKurishi was a speculator and moneylender. She also purchased exotic goods and sold them later for profit. Dozens of loyal followers worked for her, most of them rogues.\nThe Dragon Lady was a rival to the Underbaron Ozamata Ku Murawa, another of the members of the Council of Captains."
