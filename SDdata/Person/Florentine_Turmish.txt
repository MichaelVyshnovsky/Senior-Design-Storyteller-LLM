'''Florentine Dempster''' was the mayor of [[Alaghôn]] and ruler of [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the mid–2{{nd}} century [[DR]], reigning soon the nation's founding.

==History==
The wife of [[Dempster Turmish]], Florentine succeeded him after his death in the {{YearlinkName|150}}. She quickly ended her husband's wars with [[Hlondeth]] and sued for peace. Thereafter, she focused on commerce.

However, she was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|154}}. Thereafter, power changed hands between Turmish's various merchant houses, beginning the hundred-year-long Calmwaters period of Vilhon Reach history.
