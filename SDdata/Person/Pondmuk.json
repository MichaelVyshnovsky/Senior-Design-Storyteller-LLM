One of the Legions surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the towns palisades. Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from Luskan to follow two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston, southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.\nPondmuk, and his tribe, under the leadership of Chief Ogrok, was among many goblins who used the caverns underneath the fortress during the Legions war with the Ten Towns. Goblins and Pondmuk, in particular, were bullied by the Legions orcs and deprived of food. When Lord Ulbrecs mercenaries infiltrated the fortress, Pondmuk showed no hostility towards them and only asked for their help – to bring him big fat corpses of delicious giant spiders to eat. Pondmuk offered information on the Legion and the fortress in exchange for the spider corpses. He also stated the password to get into the hobgoblin part of the fortress – \"chimera.\""
