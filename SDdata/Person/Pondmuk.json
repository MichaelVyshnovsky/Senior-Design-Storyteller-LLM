        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved [[teleport]]ing goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from [[Luskan]] to follow two of his scouts, [[Ennelia]] and [[Braston]], southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.\n\nPondmuk, and his tribe, under the leadership of Chief [[Ogrok]], was among many goblins who used the caverns underneath the fortress during the Legion's war with the Ten Towns. Goblins and Pondmuk, in particular, were bullied by the Legion's [[orc]]s and deprived of food. When Lord Ulbrec's mercenaries infiltrated the fortress, Pondmuk showed no hostility towards them and only asked for their help – to bring him big fat corpses of delicious [[giant spider]]s to eat. Pondmuk offered information on the Legion and the fortress in exchange for the spider corpses. He also stated the password to get into the [[hobgoblin]] part of the fortress – \"chimera.\""
