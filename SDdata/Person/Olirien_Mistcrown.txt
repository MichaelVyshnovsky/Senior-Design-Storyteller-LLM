{{Quote|You struck a blow for [[New Sharandar|Sharandar]] this day, hero. I am pleased to call you...friend.}}

==Personality==
Olirien was a man who suffered from great anger, due in part to the fall of [[Iliyanbruen]] in [[Faerûn]]. He sought revenge against those who took up residence in the shadow of the once-great elven empire, specifically those around the city of [[Neverwinter]].

==Relationships==
He was the second-in-command of the Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar.

==History==
When the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]] threatened the elves of New Sharandar ''circa'' the  {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Olirien took lead over a forward outpost in the [[Realm of Malabog|giant-king's personal domain]] in the [[Feywild]]. He put aside his differences with the people of Neverwinter for a time, and worked with adventurers from the city to halt the efforts of Malabog's elven general [[Celadaine]].

To begin, Olirien organized foraging efforts to ensure his soldiers had enough food to survive the counter-siege. Once that was taken care of, he orchestrated the destruction of the siege weaponry that was being constructed by Malabog's [[redcap]] minions. Finally, Olirien tasked the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] with the siege of the [[Tower of Celadaine]], home to the black knight of Malabog's army, an [[elf]] he once called a close friend.
