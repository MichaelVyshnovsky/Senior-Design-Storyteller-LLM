Ansel Burwyth, also called the Master of Gems, was a skilled wizard who lived during the 4 century DR in Mulhorand or one of the nearby regions.
Ansel was hired in 326 DR, along with many other mages, by the ruling bodies of Tashalar to rid them of Magister Onsilur Maerdrathom who had become quite a nuisance to their way of life. Ansel succeeded where others who came before him failed. He was able to trap the soul of Onsilur within a telkiira. Lured by the riches left for the taking in Onsilurs tower, Ansel hid the kiira and entered the tower, only to be killed by the wide array of magical traps Onsilur had in place.
