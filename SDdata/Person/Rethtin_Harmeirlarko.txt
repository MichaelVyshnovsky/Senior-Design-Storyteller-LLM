Rethtin Harmeirlarko was the owner and manager of Harmeirlarkos Journeys, a shop that manufactured, repaired, and sold carts, wagons, carriages, and spare parts in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Rethtin was an expert wheelwright and ran a successful shop with happy employees. Many merchants and caravan masters were in his debt after he and his staff repaired an axle, fixed a wheel, moved cargo from a broken wagon to a fresh one, or took a damaged vehicle as partial payment for a replacement.
