Rethtin was an expert wheelwright and ran a successful shop with happy employees. Many merchants and caravan masters were in his debt after he and his staff repaired an axle, fixed a wheel, moved cargo from a broken wagon to a fresh one, or took a damaged vehicle as partial payment for a replacement.
