        "mainbody": "'''Ernico''' was a young man living in the village of [[Tweyar]] in [[Tethyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{TOC limit}}",
        "Description": "Ernico was a well-fit youth. He had prominent ears.",
        "History": "When [[Zaranda Star]] first tried to teach the villagers of Tweyar archery, Ernico was one of the first ones to try to learn how to shoot a [[shortbow]]. The mercenaries led by [[Balmeric]] teased the boy for struggling at the task, and this caused him to accidentally release an arrow in their direction. This incident motivated Zaranda to teach the peasants the use of [[crossbow]]s instead.\n\nErnico eventually became a member of the [[Tweyar Self-Defense Force]]. Later, when the village hetman, [[Osbard]], ordered Zaranda arrested for treason, Ernico and his friend [[Rudigar]] were also present. She soon convinced the village to release her and her companions, and Ernico was the one who happily cut her free from her bonds.\n\nWhen the village received notice from [[Baron Lutwill]] that their taxes had been doubled, Ernico suggested that they simply pay the taxes without question as they always had done, but his fellow Defense Force member [[Fiora]] disagreed with him, and the group ultimately decided to scout out the defenses of Lutwill's [[Castle Lutwill|castle]]."
