'''Talis Kasterel''', or '''Talis the White''', was a high-ranking member of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Severin Silrajin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
She was a favorite for the position of White Dragon Whisperer and joining the Cult's leadership. However, Severin gave the mask to [[Varramzord]], a [[dwarf]] friend of his. Talis's powerful friends were displeased.

Talis served as the leader of the Cult's hunting lodge in the [[Greypeak Mountains]].

In the 1480s DR, she was confronted by an adventuring party. Despite her loyalty to the Cult, the adventurers could potentially convince her to betray Severin with the right argument.

==Abilities==
She was an expert on [[white dragon]]s, at the level of Severin's knowledge about [[red dragon]]s.

==Personality==
Talis was a devoted follower of [[Tiamat]] and a traditionalist of the faith. She believed that Severin's methods deviated too much from their true objective and he just wanted glory for himself. She also greatly despised not being chosen as White Dragon Whisperer, a title that went instead to Varramzord.

She worked hard and was quite charismatic.
