Talis Kasterel, or Talis the White, was a high-ranking member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin in the late 15 century DR.
She was a favorite for the position of White Dragon Whisperer and joining the Cults leadership. However, Severin gave the mask to Varramzord, a dwarf friend of his. Taliss powerful friends were displeased.
Talis served as the leader of the Cults hunting lodge in the Greypeak Mountains.
In the 1480s DR, she was confronted by an adventuring party. Despite her loyalty to the Cult, the adventurers could potentially convince her to betray Severin with the right argument.
She was an expert on white dragons, at the level of Severins knowledge about red dragons.
Talis was a devoted follower of Tiamat and a traditionalist of the faith. She believed that Severins methods deviated too much from their true objective and he just wanted glory for himself. She also greatly despised not being chosen as White Dragon Whisperer, a title that went instead to Varramzord.
She worked hard and was quite charismatic.
