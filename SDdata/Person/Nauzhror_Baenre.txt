'''Nauzhror Baenre''' was a high-ranking [[drow]] [[abjurer]] and house wizard of [[House Baenre]] in [[Menzoberranzan]]. He was a master of [[Sorcere]] and for a time in [[1372]]–[[1373 DR]] he served as acting [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]].

==Description==
Nauzhror was plump and wore black robes and a perpetual smirk.

Nauzhror had a familiar: a plump, [[hairy spider]] that resembled its master and sat on his shoulder.

==History==
Nauzhror once ''[[polymorph]]ed'' [[Andzrel Baenre]] into a [[riding lizard]], which promptly bit Nauzhror in the buttocks. After that, the relationship between those two high-ranking males of House Baenre was somewhat strained.

During the unexplained disappearance of [[Gromph Baenre]] (who had in fact been [[Imprisonment|imprisoned]] by the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]]) during the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372]]–[[1373 DR]], Nauzhror served as the acting [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]]. During that time, Nauzhror [[scrying|scried]] the [[Pillars of Woe|Battle of the Pillars of Woe]] and saw the drow [[Army of the Black Spider]] losing the battle. Matron [[Triel Baenre]] then sent a contingent of House Baenre to allow the Menzoberranyr forces to retreat.

In [[1373 DR]], after Gromph had returned, Nauzhror assisted him telepathically during his spell battle with the Lichdrow.

==Relationships==
Nauzhror was [[Matron Mother]] Triel Baenre's first cousin, once removed.
