        "Personality": "Buntaro had the personality (and the look) of a dyspeptic bear: he rarely smiled and always seemed arrogant. Buntaro was deeply loyal to his [[daimyo]], one of the few people who liked Buntaro. He was a man of honor and duty, hating people of unstable loyalty. Buntaro was in love with his servant, [[Sono]].",
        "Relations": "Buntaro was the son-in-law of the daimyo [[Benju Matsutomo]], though his wife died in childbirth."
