'''Toron''' was a [[tiefling]] from [[Elturel]] that was forced from his home city along with others of his kind in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|We're cornered in this place. Even the bloody druids look like they might turn on us.|Toron, about staying at the [[Emerald Grove]].}}

==Activities==
He spent his time tending the [[oxen]] that accompanied his fellow Elturian tieflings.

==History==
When Elturel was briefly pulled down to the [[Nine Hells]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, and subsequently returned to [[Faer√ªn]], all the tieflings in the city were exiled from its borders. Toron joined a group led by [[Zevlor]] and traveled with them west to [[Baldur's Gate]], before being forced to find refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] [[druid]]ic enclave due to increased [[goblin]] attacks.

The compounded instances of bad fortune gave Toron much anxiety and left him feeling as if his fellow tieflings had no good course of action.
