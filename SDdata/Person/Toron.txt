Toron was a tiefling from Elturel that was forced from his home city along with others of his kind in late 15 century DR.
He spent his time tending the oxen that accompanied his fellow Elturian tieflings.
When Elturel was briefly pulled down to the Nine Hells in the , and subsequently returned to Faer√ªn, all the tieflings in the city were exiled from its borders. Toron joined a group led by Zevlor and traveled with them west to Baldurs Gate, before being forced to find refuge at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave due to increased goblin attacks.
The compounded instances of bad fortune gave Toron much anxiety and left him feeling as if his fellow tieflings had no good course of action.
