Donnabella Fiasco was a spellcaster who lived in the region of the Sword Coast North near Phandalin during the late 15 century DR.
While she preferred to spend her time studying or reading, rather than being around other people, Donnabella believed that everyone had the spark of magic within them. To her it was just a matter of discovering it and bringing that ability to the surface.
Donnabella sought to join one of the Realms prestigious schools of wizardry.
She wore a unicorn mask made from papier-mâché that she felt enhanced her magical abilities.
