'''Ansgul Khaundrove''' was a member of the [[Khaundrove]] House, one of the twenty [[Onsruur]] (council of lords) families in [[Kh么ltar]], the Iron City, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He lived with other members of his family in [[Baharrokhbrur]], a fancy sculpted stone mansion near the southern gate into the city.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|69}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Kh么ltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}

==Personality==
Old Ansgul thought that most foreigners were either stupid or foolish and this was borne out by the fact that his family made huge profits selling cheep versions of ironmongery made from the lowest quality raw materials to "perfumed [[Calimshan]], where they're too decadent to know any better", for example.

==Relationships==
Like the rest of the Khaundrove clan, Ansgul had a strong dislike for their chief rivals, the [[Horthander]]s&mdash;another influential family in the Iron City.
