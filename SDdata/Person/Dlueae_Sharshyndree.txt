'''Dlueae Sharshyndree''' was one of the eight members of the [[First Zulkirate]], the first female zulkir, and the [[Zulkir]] of [[Evocation]] in 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Dlueae was a buxom Thayan [[human]] woman with a melodious voice and delicate seductive strut. In contrast, her face was rough, badly scarred, and masculine. She shaved facial hair and most times wore full-head masks as well as a bottle-[[helm]].

==History==
In her youth, the future zulkir led an adventurer's life that resulted in a collection of disfiguring facial scars. But that vocation also granted her skills of a confident and level-headed battle-leader and tactician. Later in life, she led [[Thay]]'s armies into wars. Through military life, she gained influence among other [[Red Wizards]]. Dlueae Sharshyndree became the first member of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] from the [[school of magic|school of evocation magic]] in the autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1030}}. The council was assembled under the [[diviner]] [[lich]] [[Ythazz Buvaar]]. The title allowed Dlueae to select the [[tharchion]]s and gave her absolute control over a sliver of [[Thay]]. She became an influential member of the First Zulkirate, taking fellow zulkirs as consorts and helping them with delicate personal matters. She had a solid track record of creating successful policies for the nation supported by the zulkirate. She also served as the Council's mediator and peacemaker.

Dlueae's reign as the Zullkir of Evocation came to an end sometime before the late {{YearlinkName|1300}}.
