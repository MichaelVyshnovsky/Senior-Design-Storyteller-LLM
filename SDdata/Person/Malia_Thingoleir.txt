'''Malia Thingoleir''' was a [[wizard]] who lived at [[Fourstaves House]] in [[Yhaunn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Malia was an eminently practical person, always ready for any situation that might arise.

==Abilities==
She took after her parents and wielded her magic with a staff, favoring powerful blasting spells like her father.

==Relationships==
Malia was the first child of [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and [[Dagnalla Irongard]], and the elder sibling of [[Roderio Thingoleir|Roderio]] and [[Keph Thingoleir|Keph]]. Although she tried to do best by him, she could not contain her disgust for Keph's irresponsible behaviour and disrespect for their family.

She initially met [[Krin Foxrun]] as a young woman, immediately falling in love. They eventually became married and had their first child, [[Adrey Foxrun|Adrey]]. Malia felt responsible for taking care of her whole family, though she always put her husband and child first.

==History==
Malia was born on the same day that Fourstaves House (then Twostaves) finished construction. She became her parent's first apprentice in magic, and they renamed the hall to Threestaves in her honor.

In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], she helped her parents study the ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]'' after it was discovered in Yhaunn.

Her quick thinking and readiness helped save Roderio's life when Keph caused his workshop to explode, treating him with ''[[Potion of healing|potions of healing]]'' until a [[cleric]] healer could arrive.

Later on, she helped her family defend the [[Stiltways]] from [[Variance Amatick]]'s [[shadow mastiff]]s and prevented any deaths from occurring.
