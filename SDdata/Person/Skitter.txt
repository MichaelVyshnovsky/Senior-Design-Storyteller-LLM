==History==
Skitter served its master Kuldail as he defended [[Druid's Deep]] for the insane [[druid]] [[Halsaime]]. Kuldail and the other druids and rangers of the grove had been subverted by the strange magical powers of [[Halsaime's staff]], which turned them into single-minded soldiers against the world.
