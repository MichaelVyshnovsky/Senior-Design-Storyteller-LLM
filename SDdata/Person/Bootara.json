        "mainbody": "Bootara was a wind spirit who resided on the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the 14 century DR.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the tribes of the Living Jungle, as well as the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba, believed that Bootara was responsible for black clouds being stirred around the Fire Mountain, and bringing forth the storms. Like other spirits of Malatra, Bootara was an elemental creature of unknown age."
