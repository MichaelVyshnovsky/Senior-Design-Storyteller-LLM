dwarf
Minder was an iron golem crew-member of the Halruaan caravel ship Realms Master in 1370 DR.
Minder was a female dwarf who joined Dwalimar Omen in his mission to acquire the Astrolabe of Nimbral. However, in the battle against the crystalgriff guardian of the object, Minder fell. Omen managed to transfer Minders spirit into the body of an iron golem. Minder followed loyally Omen in all his adventures.
Later, her original golem body was destroyed but its head remained intact and was incorporated to a steel statue by a dwarven artisan nicknamed Forgemaster, as part of a plan by Lord Los of the Akri tribe to create an army of living statues. Unknown to them, Minders spirit remained in the head and took control of the body, helping her friends escape. Minders second body was stronger and much more anatomically correct than the first. 
Minder missed the air of her homeland and the taste of good food. Still, she was a wise warrior, always in control of a situation.
Minder was the confidant and best friend of Omen. She found her soulmate in Onyx the Invincible.
As a golem, Minder had no need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Normally she fought with her bare hands.
