        "mainbody": "Sherlen Miller was the commander of the militia and the constable in Daggerford around 1485 DR.\nHer dual role meant Sherlen had to use two different aspects of her personality as a militia commander, she trained her fellow warriors as constable, she had to mediate disputes and take care of the dukes interests.\nSherlen considered it a great honor serving in the same role as her namesake Sherlen Spearslayer. She preferred her role as commander, feeling she did not suit the diplomatic role she had as constable."
