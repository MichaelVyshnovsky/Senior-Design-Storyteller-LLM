        "mainbody": "Judarin, also called the Sot, was an elven bard/saluk inhabiting Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nJudarin was rude and lacked respect for authority and any organized religion.\nJudarin was a drunk who always appeared disheveled. His dolman was stained with wine.\nHe spent much of his time reciting poetry and verses detailing his agnostic beliefs and general lack of faith for the Enlightened gods, an act for which he would probably be executed as a heretic if even taken before a qadi. However, Judarin seemed doomed, or blessed, to forever remain surrounded by obscurity."
