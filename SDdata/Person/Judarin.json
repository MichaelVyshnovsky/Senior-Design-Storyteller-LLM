        "Description": "Judarin was a drunk who always appeared disheveled. His ''[[dolman]]'' was stained with wine.",
        "Activities": "He spent much of his time reciting poetry and verses detailing his agnostic beliefs and general lack of faith for the [[Zakharan pantheon|Enlightened gods]], an act for which he would probably be executed as a heretic if even taken before a ''[[Midani dictionary|qadi]]''. However, Judarin seemed doomed, or blessed, to forever remain surrounded by obscurity."
