Isajar was the Keeper of Tomes of Candlekeep at some point.
Isajar had a reputation for disliking the usage of the hard c in his writing, instead favoring the letter k.
As Keeper of Tomes, Isajar was responsible for the governance of Candlekeep as well as appointing scholars to various leadership roles within the order of the Avowed.
At some point, Isajar penned the tome Kandlekeep Dekonstruktion, which detailed how Candlekeep was built and even its magical wards.
