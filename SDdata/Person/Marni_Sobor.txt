Marni Sobor was a shopkeeper in Skullport.
Marni was studying as a wizard when in 1370 DR her mother was killed in a robbery and she inherited the shop.
Marni wanted nothing more than to go back to her magical studies and abandon the shop. However, she loved her brother and her sister and knew that they needed a good amount of money in order for them to live comfortably until she finished her three-year wizard training.
