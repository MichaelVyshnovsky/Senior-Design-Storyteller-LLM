        "mainbody": "Othimturac was a shadow white dragon bred by the Jaezred Chaulssin of Karsoluthiyl.\nAs part of an experiment, the Jaezred Chaulssin of Karsoluthiyl crossbred various kinds of chromatic dragons with shadow dragons in order to create a more suitable race. However, only Othimturac, the white dragon offspring, survived (the Jaezred speculated that it was his immunity to cold that permitted his survival). He was later used as a guard for the tower of House Oussgym, the local Jaezred headquarters. In 1374 DR, he was eventually defeated by an adventuring party that had infiltrated the tower."
