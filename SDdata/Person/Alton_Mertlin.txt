'''Alton Mertlin''' was the commander of the militia of [[Teziir]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Alton led a force of 500 leather-armored individuals. However, he had no organization skills and usually his men arrived too late. He pressed the [[Teziir City Council]] to build walls for the city but not too hard, because it was for of the question of the walls that his predecessor lost the job.
