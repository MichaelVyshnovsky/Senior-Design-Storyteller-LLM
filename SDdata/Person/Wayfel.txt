Wayfel was a struggling blacksmith inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His smithy was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford at the junction of Wall Street and Horse Way.
Wayfels skills as a blacksmith were utterly lacking in quality, especially when compared to the local rival blacksmith Derval Ironeater.
He was single but actively pursuing finding a mate.
