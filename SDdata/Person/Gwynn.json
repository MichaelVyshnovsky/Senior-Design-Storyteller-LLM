About a hundred years later, the arcanist invented another spell, ''[[vampiric touch]]'', which was also originally named after Gwynn, and was known as ''Gwynn's vampirism''.\n\n''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}}, Gwynn's name was shouted along with those of other prominent arcanists by [[Sysquemalyn]] when she and [[Candlemas]] tried to escape the [[Nine Hells]]."
