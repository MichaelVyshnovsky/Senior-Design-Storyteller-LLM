'''Glenna Moonsmith''' was a [[dwarf]] innkeeper and tavern owner in the village of [[The Stop]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|5-7}}

==Activities==
Glenna managed the inn and tavern called the [[Plodding Plow]].
 
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], some of her farmer customers told Glenna about an attack by a new tribe of [[goblin]]s. After [[Arduro]] and [[Doster]], two [[human]] workers, told her that the [[Arcrus]] farm had just been attacked, Glenna hired an adventuring party who happened to be in her tavern to go to investigate.

==Personality==
Glenna was a charming and outgoing individual with a good heart. She preferred dealing with locals than with merchants. Glenna was known to be softhearted but was aware that scared people often exaggerated.

Glenna lived in fear of being arrested by officials of [[Hillsfar]] and never wanted to speak about that city.{{Cite adventurers league/Death on the Wall|7}}
