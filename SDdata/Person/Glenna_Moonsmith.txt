Glenna Moonsmith was a dwarf innkeeper and tavern owner in the village of The Stop in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Glenna managed the inn and tavern called the Plodding Plow.
Circa 1486 DR, some of her farmer customers told Glenna about an attack by a new tribe of goblins. After Arduro and Doster, two human workers, told her that the Arcrus farm had just been attacked, Glenna hired an adventuring party who happened to be in her tavern to go to investigate.
Glenna was a charming and outgoing individual with a good heart. She preferred dealing with locals than with merchants. Glenna was known to be softhearted but was aware that scared people often exaggerated.
Glenna lived in fear of being arrested by officials of Hillsfar and never wanted to speak about that city.
