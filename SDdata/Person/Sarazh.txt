==Description==
Sarazh was a [[tiefling]] woman with pale, wrinkled skin. She had blue eyes and wispy gray hair, which she wore in a messy topknot. Her dreamy expression and tiny build made her appear more delicate than she actually was.

==Personality==
Sarazh was very observant and had an incredible memory for details, which served her well in her role in her faction. She could recall pages that she had read, maps that she had studied, faces that she had met in childhood&mdash;all with astonishing accuracy. She was exceptionally intelligent and was able to piece together and correlate facts to solve mysteries.

==Abilities==
As a worshiper of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] god of written knowledge, she had access to [[Divine magic|divine]] spells classified into the [[Astral sphere|astral]], [[Charm sphere|charm]], [[Divination sphere|divination]], and [[Guardian sphere|guardian]] [[sphere]]s. She was especially skilled in divinatory magics such as ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[tongues]]'', among others.

==Possessions==
Sarazh typically carried a [[quarterstaff]] with her.

==Activities==
Sarazh ran the [[Dreamhearth]], a manor and estate for the Sign of One located in the frontier settlement of Signpost, but she effectively also served as that town's marshal and mayor. She assisted [[Factol]] [[Darius]] in searching the multiverse for clues toward their faction's purpose.

==History==
