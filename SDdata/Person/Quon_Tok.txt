Quon Tok was a bushi in Shou Lung.
In 1358 DR, at the komite in Suijeng, Quon Tok picked fights for a living. He was helped by his companion Jo Chuik, who organized bets about Quons fighting. Obviously, Quon signaled to Jo Chuik if he thought he would win or lose so his companion could make the right bets.
