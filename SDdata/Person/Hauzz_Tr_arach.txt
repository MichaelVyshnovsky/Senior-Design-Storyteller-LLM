'''Hauzz Tr'arach''' was a [[drow]] matron mother in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Hauzz ruled [[House Tr'arach]] in [[Menzoberranzan]], a small house. She plotted to one day elevate her eldest daughter to the [[Ruling Council]].

In [[1018 DR]], Hauzz with her elder children [[Daungelina Tr'arach]] and [[Duvon Tr'arach]] planned an attack on [[House Simfray]] and after being reassured about the wizards they had hired from [[House Xorlarrin]] and about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master [[Zaknafein]], the matron mother ordered the attack.

After the attack failed completely, Hauzz together with her youngest daughter [[Dab'nay Tr'arach]] protested about the failure with [[Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin]], who informed her about the survival of Duvon.
However, it was Zaknafein disguised as Duvon who arrived at the House Tr'arach complex and quickly killed Hauzz.
