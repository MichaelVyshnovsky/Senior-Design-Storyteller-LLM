'''Baragustas Harbuckler''' was a retired carpenter in [[Red Larch]] and a member of the [[Believers]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Relationships==
Baragustas was an old member of Believers.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], he was quite intimidated by [[Larrakh]] of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]], who tried to put the Believers in a more active role. He was not part in the murders committed by [[Ilmeth Waelvur]], [[Marlandro Gaelkur]], and [[Albaeri Mellikho]] but knew of  the matter and covered for them. He was subdued by some adventurers who were investigating in the village.
