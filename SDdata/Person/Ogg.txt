Ogg was a hill giant who, together with Lob, led an attack on Goldenfields sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Lob and Ogg always traveled together.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, under the orders of chief Guh, Lob and Ogg went in search of food for Guh. After wandering, they led a giant contingent to Goldenfields. However, they were defeated by some adventurers.
