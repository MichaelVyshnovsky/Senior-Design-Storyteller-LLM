'''Ssessimyth''' was a powerful [[kraken]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Somehow, Ssessimyth entered into symbiosis with the [[mythal]] of the ruined [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Sakkors]]. When the [[Princes of Shade]] [[Rivalen Tanthul]] and [[Brennus Tanthul]] restored the flying city, Rivalen managed to enslave Ssessimyth. On [[Uktar 11]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Rivalen ordered him to attack the docks of [[Yhaunn]] in order to distract the city's guards.
