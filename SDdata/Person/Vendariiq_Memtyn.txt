'''Vendariiq Memtyn''' was a leading member of the [[derro]] [[Council of Savants]] and the "high priest" of [[Diirinka]] in [[Gracklstugh]] in [[1370 DR]]. 

==Personality==
Despite his role as the main caretaker of the worship of Diirinka, Vendariiq had little interest in preaching. He preferred to scheme with his fellow savants. His areas of expertise were the magical legacies of the [[elves]] of the [[High Forest]], the [[human]]s of [[Ascalhorn]], and the legendary [[wyrm]]s of the [[North]].

==History==
Vendariiq was a prominent member of the faction of savants, and he led the derro in the worship of Diirinka by tending the god's shrine. He was interested in the fall of [[Hellgate Keep]] and the opportunity that this provided, sending many expeditions to scavenge its catacombs.
