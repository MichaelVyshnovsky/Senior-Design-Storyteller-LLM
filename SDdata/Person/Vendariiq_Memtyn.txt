Vendariiq Memtyn was a leading member of the derro Council of Savants and the "high priest" of Diirinka in Gracklstugh in 1370 DR. 
Despite his role as the main caretaker of the worship of Diirinka, Vendariiq had little interest in preaching. He preferred to scheme with his fellow savants. His areas of expertise were the magical legacies of the elves of the High Forest, the humans of Ascalhorn, and the legendary wyrms of the North.
Vendariiq was a prominent member of the faction of savants, and he led the derro in the worship of Diirinka by tending the gods shrine. He was interested in the fall of Hellgate Keep and the opportunity that this provided, sending many expeditions to scavenge its catacombs.
