        "Activitivies": "Flameran worked in the great [[Dellmon]] farm in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. He was also an agent of the [[Emerald Enclave]].",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], the [[Iceshield]] [[orc]]s attacked many farms around the Dellmon property. However, [[Kerbin Dellmon]] refused to abandon his farm and flee to [[Yartar]], instead deciding to fight with the aid of his family and workers, including Flameran. Flameran helped [[Dreena Dellmon]] to ask the help of the [[elf|elves]] of the [[High Forest]]. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm."
