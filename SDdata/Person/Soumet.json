        "mainbody": "Soumet was an adventurer inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShe lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford at the intersection of Water Street and Kaoth Alley near the River Gate.\nSoumet craved adventure and was drawn to men whose desire for a rush of adrenaline matched her own. She married a fellow adventurer in her company, only to dump him shortly after for another member of the same company who was slightly more reckless. She continued this pattern over two years until she had married five of the six men in the company. Eventually the company decided that she was not good for their morale and collectively dumped her in Daggerford."
