        "History": "Namji made his name by being an overhasty battle wizard who delighted in tossing destructive spells at his opponents. He also created a unique and powerful [[enchanted]] ''[[Namji's robe|robe]]'' that offered little spell resistance but ''[[regenerat]]ed'' any battle damage Namji sustained. However, his most famous invention was ''[[Namji's burning hands]]'', a more powerful adaptation of the regular ''[[burning hands]]'' [[spell]].\n\nThe wizard's final fate remained unknown; however, ''Namji's robe'' was aboard an old shipwreck. It was found on the island of an [[undead]] [[white dragon]] [[Icasaracht]], on [[Lac Dinneshere]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. The discovery took place in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}."
