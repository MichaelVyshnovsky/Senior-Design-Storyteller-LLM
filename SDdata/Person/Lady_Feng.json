One of her eyes bulged out of its socket while the other was always squinted, milky white with a black pupil that was could see through to the spirit world.\nDue to her spiritual beliefs and specific practice of magic, Feng did not believe in a distinction between life and death, rather they were two manifestations of one continued state of being.\nDespite her wealth of spiritual wisdom, Lady Feng had a great appreciation and even a bit of greed for material riches, such as gold and finely-crafted gem stones.\nLady Feng was extremely adept in the art of wielding spirit magic, and was a student of Yen-Wang-Yeh, the Great Judge.\nLady Feng was the third wife of Emperor Kao Tsao Shou Tang, the mother of Prince Kao Chou Tang,\nShe had a lemur familiar called Winter Blossom.\nIn the , the black dracolich known as Hethcypressarvil abducted Lady Feng from the Ginger Palace and manipulated her son Prince Tang, into creating an oil made from ylang blossoms from Shou Lung. The undead dragon desired the senior wu jen into formulating a love potion that would force Lady Yanseldara of Elversult into loving him the same manner as he did her.\nSetting out to prove himself as a leader, Prince Tang ventured out alongside General Fui Dhang and several squads of Shou royal guardsmen to rescue Lady Feng from the nameless swamp. Nearly all of the soldiers were slain by Cypress and its wyvern pets, Tang was forced to flee the assault, managing to navigate through the dragons underground lair and finally find his mothers whereabouts.\nReunited in the caverns beneath the swamp, mother and son were able to briefly outsmart Cypress and force him to leave his lair for the surface above. Together they retrieved the staff with the spirit gem holding both her and the Cypress souls, and shattered it into many pieces, preventing the undead dragon from regenerating its physical form after being destroyed.\nAfter their ordeal, Lady Feng joined her son, Minister Hsieh Han Liu, the Harper Ruha, and the leaders of Elversult for a grand feast, celebrating the newfound friendship between that city and the Ginger Palace."
