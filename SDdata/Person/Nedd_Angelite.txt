'''Nedd Angelite''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] resident of [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|15}}

==Relationships==
He was friends with fellow teenagers [[Alana Hallwinter]], [[Sasha Flint]], and [[Grace Hardstone]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|16}}

==History==
When he was a teenager in the 1490s DR, he and two dwarven friends&mdash;Sasha and Grace&mdash;became skeptical of some of the tall tales written by [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in the newly published ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|17}} The three dwarves decided to travel to the [[Crooked Forest]] to investigate, and were subsequently captured by [[gnoll]]s. Soon, their friend Alana arrived in the woods to search for them, but was captured as well. The harrowing ordeal left Nedd in shock and barely able to speak.
