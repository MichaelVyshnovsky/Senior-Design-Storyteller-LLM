        "mainbody": "Rumpadump was a myconid sprout of Neverlight Grove in the late 15 century DR.\nRumpadump was a friend of Stool.\nRumpadump was quite introverted, in contrast to its companion Stools outgoing nature. Rumpadump would rather stay back from social encounters and would not release its rapport spores until it was vital.\nRumpadump lived in Neverlight Grove in the \"troupe\" of Voosbur. Directed by Zuggtmoys will, Voosbur led its troupe to Gracklstugh to collect bigwig and pygmywort mushrooms. Rumpadump was the only one that remained free from Zuggtmoys corruption, and was concerned that Voosburs \"strange spores\" had affected the rest of myconid community."
