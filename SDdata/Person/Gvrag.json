        "mainbody": "Gvrag was a bugbear bandit of the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR. He served Skar and ultimately Hekkut and the Hark.\nHe had a hulking but stooped figure.\nLike many bugbears, he fought with morning star, light wooden shield, and javelins and wore leather armor, and may have had a potion of cure light wounds.\nLate one afternoon in Eleasias of the , Gvrag and Skar and two other goblins caught the halfling merchant Blaz Merrymar on the road between Loudwater and Shining Falls. While Gvrag held Blaz in the air, Skar tormented and tortured him with a lit torch. Fortunately for Blaz, a newly formed band of adventurers happened upon the scene and rescued him, slaying Gvrag and the others."
