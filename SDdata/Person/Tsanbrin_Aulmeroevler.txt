Tsanbrin Aulmeroevler held the title of Magister of Faer√ªn from 242 DR until 244 DR.
Tsanbrin was a cheerful trickster. He was driven by a need to perform acrobatics and pranks, freely giving away magical secrets in the process.
Tsanbrin challenged Weldrarn Orblin after that Magister destroyed the school of wizardry where Tsanbrin was studying in Sultim. Tsanbrin was only able to defeat Weldrarn in the duel because of his impressive acrobatic skills and chaotic behavior. Weldrarn unknowingly blasted a tower during the duel which crashed on top of him resulting in his death.
Tsanbrin lost his second duel as Magister, perishing at the hands of Brymmyn Thorl. After his death Tsanbrin served Mystra as one of the goddesses strongest shadowstaves.
