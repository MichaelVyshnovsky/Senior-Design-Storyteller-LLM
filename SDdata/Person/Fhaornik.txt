'''Fhaornik''' was a [[sun elf]] apprentice at [[Blackstaff Tower]]. On [[Uktar 28]], [[1374 DR]], he was involved in the defense of the tower against [[Kemarn Darkthrush]]. He threw a ''[[rod of absorption]]'' into Kemarn's summoned [[nishruu]], but it did not destroy the creature as he had hoped.
