'''Verthisathurgiesh Mehen''' was a [[dragonborn]] [[mercenary]] and [[bounty hunter]] of [[Tymanther]] and a member of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and formerly a ''thrikominaki'' (clanless dragonborn).

==History==
In his youth, Mehen was a close friend of [[Verthisathurgiesh Arjhani|Arjhani]], [[Kepeshkmolik Uadjit|Uadjit]], and [[Ophinshtalajiir Sepideh|Sepideh]] during their service in the [[Lance Defenders]]. Mehen and [[Tarhun]] served at the same time on the Lance Defenders when they were young. They even patrolled together, but never became friends.

Around [[1450 DR]], Pandjed exiled Mehen from his clan because he had a homosexual relationship with Arjhani and didn't want to marry Uadjit. Mehen went to live in the remote village of [[Arush Vayem]], vowing to never again return to Djerad Thymar.

In the {{yearlinkName|1460}}, Mehen adopted the infant [[tiefling]]s [[Farideh]] and [[Havilar]], who were left in a basket at the gate of the village of Arush Vayem.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|344}} Some years later, Arjhani went to the village to try to convince Mehen to return to Djerad Thymar, but in vain. Instead, Arjhani lived with Mehen and his family for a summer, yet at the end of the summer Arjhani abandoned them without saying a word. This act earned him the enmity of Mehen and his two daughters.

In the {{yearlinkName|1477}}, Havilar was in a barn attempting to summon an [[imp]] when she accidentally summoned a [[cambion]] from [[Malbolge]] named [[Lorcan]]. Her twin Farideh was tricked by Lorcan into entering into a [[warlock]] pact. When Lorcan returned to his home [[plane]], he caused an explosion that leveled the barn and resulted in Havilar, Farideh, and Mehen being expelled from the village.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|13-30}}

After Mehen and his family were kicked out of Arush Vayem, they began working as bounty hunters. While pursuing a bounty on a [[Torm]]ite priestess on the [[Sword Coast]], they aided a caravan under attack by [[orc]]s and befriended a young runaway Tormite acolyte named [[Aubrin Crownsilver|Brin]], who was traveling with the caravan to [[Neverwinter]]. Brin was the target of Mehen's bounty, who was attempting to return him to [[Cormyr]]. Brin convinced the trio that they should travel to Neverwinter and wait for the priestess to show up at the Tormite temple.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|??}}

Later, in the {{yearlinkName|1478}}, Mehen, Farideh, and Havilar returned their bounty, [[Constancia Crownsilver]], to [[Suzail]] through the [[Waterdeep]] ''[[portal]]''. Due to a lack of funds, only Mehen and Constancia were able to make the journey through the portal while Farideh and Havilar remained behind in Waterdeep.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|688}}

In the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, Mehen was working as a mercenary in [[Cormyr]]. During this time, Mehen and another dragonborn, [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]], became close, but Mehen's insecurities didn't allow their relationship to blossom. In [[Nightal]] of the same year, Mehen, along with his daughters and Brin, returned to Djerad Thymar, when he was invited by his aunt [[Verthisathurgiesh Anala]], who wanted him to became a member of the clan once more. However, [[Verthisathurgiesh Baruz|Baruz]], Mehen's cousin, was found dead the same day Mehen arrived in the city. Anala hired Mehen to help her uncover the assassin of her son.

As a "reward" for his services, Anala lifted Mehen's exile and chose him as the candidate of Clan Verthisathurgiesh for the elections to choose the new [[Vanquisher]], which were expected to be celebrated in the {{yearlinkName|1487}}.

In the wake of the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR, Mehen and Kallan, with the help of Uadjit, helped with efforts to rescue the survivors of the exchanging of lands between [[Toril]] and [[Abeir]]. He was also one of the dragonborn who supported the decision to allow Namshita's refugees to live in Tymanther, in gratitude for Namshita's help against the [[Unther]]ans.

During the [[first Tymanther-Unther War]], Mehen, alongside [[Tam Zawad|Tam]] and [[Mira Zawad]], Brin and [[Dahl Peredur]], helped with the [[ritual]] to bring [[Nanna-Sin]] back to life as an immortal being.

Mehen and Kallan officially started their relationship after the war ended.
