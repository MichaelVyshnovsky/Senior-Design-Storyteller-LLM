'''Fortenesti''' was an [[imp]] in the ruin of [[Methegrist]] in the [[Moonwood]].
  
==Personality==
Fortenesti always spoke in rhymes, enjoying it if people couldn't understand his words.
 
==History==
In [[1384 DR]], just after the death of [[Helm]], Fortenesti infiltrated Methegrist, the fortress of the [[Moonwatchers]], a group of [[paladin]] followers of [[Helm]]. He managed to turn the paladins against each other, the first to be manipulated being [[Jahar]].

In [[1484 DR]], the imp still lived in the ruins when an adventuring party following Jahar's [[phantom]] confronted and defeated him.
