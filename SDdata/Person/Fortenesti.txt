Fortenesti was an imp in the ruin of Methegrist in the Moonwood.
Fortenesti always spoke in rhymes, enjoying it if people couldnt understand his words.
In 1384 DR, just after the death of Helm, Fortenesti infiltrated Methegrist, the fortress of the Moonwatchers, a group of paladin followers of Helm. He managed to turn the paladins against each other, the first to be manipulated being Jahar.
In 1484 DR, the imp still lived in the ruins when an adventuring party following Jahars phantom confronted and defeated him.
