        "mainbody": "'''Yarealla''' was a powerful [[Rashemen|Rashemi]] [[Wizard|witch]] who had an extremely strong connection to the spirit world.  In [[1480 DR]] she was driven mad and apparently committed suicide, leaving her young daughter behind. In reality, Yarealla was murdered by the [[Witches of Rashemen|Wychlaren]] [[Sree]] because of Yarealla's refusal to join the Wychlaren and because Sree wanted to raise Yarealla's child as a Wychlaren.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road|4959}}\n\nYarealla didn't go quietly to the grave. Her spirit began haunting her village, casuing crops to fail and agitating the native spirits of Rashemen.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road|4479}} Yarealla's spirit reached out to the [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] witch [[Ilvani]] who also had a strong connection to the spirit world. Yarealla began haunting Ilvani's dreams which caused the creatures of the [[Shadowfell]] to go mad whenever Ilvani was near.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road|786}}\n\nIn 1480 DR, Ilvani set out with a caravan to Rashemen to seek out the Wychlaren and the source of her haunting. The witches were able to perform a ritual which put Yarealla's spirit at rest.{{Cite digital book/The Darker Road|5232}}",
