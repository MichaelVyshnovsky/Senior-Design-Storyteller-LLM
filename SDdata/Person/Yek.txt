'''Yek the Tall''' was the boss of the [[Rustbone Tribe|Rustbone]] [[goblin]] tribe in [[Undermountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Yek ruled a large goblin tribe that settled in the [[Arcane Chambers]] of Undermountain, where they opened a bazaar that opposed the goals of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar Guild]] for the level.

In {{Yearlink|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} Yek found a magic gold circlet, a ''[[circlet of human perfection]]'', that turned him into a [[human]]. Around the same time, the Rustbone Tribe captured the [[dwarf]] adventurer [[Copper Stormforge]].

==Personality==
Yek liked his new body, especially because he was taller than before, despite the criticism of many of his subjects. He was very vain.

==Relationships==
Yek had some paid [[bugbear]]s as guards. Some of his goblin subjects were quietly seeking a means to reverse their boss to his goblin body.
