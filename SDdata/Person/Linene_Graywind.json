        "mainbody": "'''Linene Graywind''' was the master of the [[Lionshield Coster (Phandalin)|Lionshield Coster]] trading post in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "She was described to be sharp-tongued. and was grateful to anyone that could aid her in times of need.",
        "Activities": "Graywind was a representative of the [[Lionshield Coster]], a [[Yartar]]-based merchant organization. She traded in a wide variety of supplies, and the Lionshield Coster was the main place to buy finished goods{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Storm Lord's Wrath}} Linene did not deal in illicit goods, and was willing to sell [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] only to those whom she felt would not threaten the village of Phandalin. If her store did not carry a piece of equipment, she could place a special order to have it delivered within a few days, a service for which she required the customer to pay a deposit.\n\nShe lived in a small house just west of her business.",
        "Relationships": "Linene had a daughter, [[Minghee Graywind]], about whom she was prone to worry but tried to be supportive. \n\nShe was friends with [[Alaestra Ulgar]], a colleague who managed the [[Lion's Share]] in [[Triboar]].",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} Linene expected a large shipment of goods from Yartar, but they never arrived. The caravan transporting the weapons and armor was raided by [[Cragmaw tribe]] [[goblin]]s, and was taken to their [[Cragmaw Hideout|base]].\n\nShe refused to do business with the [[Redbrands]], a local bandit group, and advised adventurers to stay away from the [[Sleeping Giant]], where the ruffians drank.\n\nFollowing the attacks by the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the surrounding region, Linene hired on [[Velleen Firecrow]] as a new assistant and courier. Velleen and her cadre of adoring [[kobold]]s turned out to be spies for the evil [[Cult of Talos]].\n\nIn [[1496 DR]],{{AI-time}} Linene was training her daughter, [[Minghee Graywind|Minghee]], to someday take over the business, which now found itself in stiff competition with the [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]] under the ownership of [[Sharna Quirstiron]]. However, Minghee wanted to travel, or to at least find a job that would allow her to do so, which concerned Linene."
