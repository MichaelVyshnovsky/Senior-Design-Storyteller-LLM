        "mainbody": "Delmair Rallyhorn was a half-elf ranger who loved to hunt evil monsters around 1358 DR. If struck by an enemy, he had the uncanny ability to temporarily transform into a tiger.\nThe ranger had blonde matted hair and blue eyes. He wore elven chain mail +2, and dark blue cloak. Delmair carried a short sword +1, a longsword +1, and a longbow plus fifteen arrows +2 in his quiver.\nDelmair was trained to seek evil and destroy. At some point, his father was killed by bandits. The elf hunted down and killed the bandits, but he never managed to find his fathers sword Dhauzimmer (the Bright Blade). He met the Heroes of Waterdeep on a forest trail and asked to be allowed to join them in search of Dhauzimmer and a quest to destroy the evil that infested the land."
