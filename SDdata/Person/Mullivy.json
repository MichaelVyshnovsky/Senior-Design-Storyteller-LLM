        "Description": "The groundskeeper was described to be scruffy, with a dirty face and gray hair. He had browned skin from four decades of working the grounds of the library under the scorching sun. Mullivy resided in a small shed off of the library's main building.",
        "Personality": "He was not the sharpest tool in the shed, but always showed respect to the associates of the library. Despite this, he had an addiction to alcohol, and would occasionally take [[wine]] from a lower complex of the library. Mullivy was not keen on squirrels, such as [[Percival]], who were threatened by him with his rake, owing to the amount of acorn husks they left over the library's grounds.",
        "History": {
            "Life": "Barjin, the [[evil]] [[priest]] of [[Talona]], first encountered the man on his first day of approaching the great library in 1361 DR. He believed that, if anyone knew a secret way into the complex, it was Mullivy. As the groundskeeper was entering his shed on that same day, Barjin assaulted him, pushing him down to the floor and closing the door behind him. Barjin hung the innocent man by his wrists and left him there for many hours. Barjin asked the janitor if he knew of any way in other than the main entrance, but Mullivy would not yield.\n\n{{fq\n|text=I could kill you and ask your corpse.<br/>Dead men talk, I assure you, and they do not lie.\n|source=Barjin's threat to Mullivy\n|float=left\n|width=270px\n}}\nAfter further interrogation, including using evil clerical magic and ''[[charm]]'' spells against the poor man, Mullivy could take no more.
