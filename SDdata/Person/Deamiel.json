        "mainbody": "'''Deamiel''' was a [[demon]] that served [[Pandorym]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Darkvision|43-48|5}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"NN\">Deamiel's exact type of fiend is never stated; its cloven feet likely rule out a [[naztharune]] [[rakshasa]], which would otherwise be a foregone conclusion, given the proximity to [[Veldorn]] and its willingness to serve [[Pandorym]]. It is described as infernal, which suggests devils of the Nine Hells. However, similar creatures later in the story are described as demonic. As demons are the most varied group, this article is written under the assumption Deamiel is a demon of some sort.",
        "Description": "Deamiel resembled a [[panther]]-headed humanoid covered in black fur, but it had cloven hooves for feet. Where it stepped, it left a thin trail of glistening slime. It wore an amulet of [[plangent crystal]].",
        "Abilities": "Deamiel was able to summon mist for concealment, and it was able to call on an amulet of plangent crystal it wore in order to multiply its strength and speed. However, it seemed to lose some grace and control while its abilities were so boosted.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlink|1374}}, Deamiel had been pursuing [[Ususi Manaallin]] while she searched the border between [[Veldorn]] and [[Estagund]] for [[Imaskari]] [[portals]] to the [[Celestial Nadir]]. Its own trail was discovered by a second pursuer, [[Iahn Qoyllor]], an [[Imaskari vengeance taker]] who was also searching for Ususi.{{cite book/Darkvision|5|1}} Deamiel's group reached Ususi's wagon before Iahn did, while she was out exploring a ruin.\n\nAfter trashing the wagon searching for her, they noticed Iahn tailing them, and attacked in spite of the tracker's request to talk. Though numbers, surprise, and power were all on Deamiel's side, Iahn Qoyllor eventually prevailed in the fight, accidentally defeating Deamiel by attacking its amulet while it was trying to choke him out slowly. The amulet exploded with unexpected violence at the slightest attack, reducing most of the fiend's insides to a charred mess.\n\nThere may have been more demons akin to it in the [[Imperial Weapons Cache]].{{cite book/Darkvision|290|30}}"
