Hoping to be reunited with her steed, Diana ventured into the Feywild realm of Prismeer, and sought after Granny Skabatha Nightshade. Rather than bring Dianas horse back, Granny Nightshade fused Dianas body with that of her mount, transforming her into her form that so closely resembled a centaur.\nAfter Diana ran away from Prismeer, she encountered Mister Light, one of two partners who ran the Witchlight Carnival. Mister Light felt for Dianas plight, and offered her both a job and home within the traveling Fey carnival."
