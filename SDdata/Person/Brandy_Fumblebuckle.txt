Brandy Fumblebuckle was an adventurer in Cormyr with the Grand Fist company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Brandy was a helpful, kind and pleasant person, but was also rather useless and incompetent in most regards.
In , Brandy and Jacer Wind-dancer attended a party at Thistleflame Keep, held by Lord Partic Thistle for King Azoun IVs birthday. They were interviewed as suspects after Lord Thistle appeared to be murdered at the party, but any suspicions that they committed a complex and lethal plot were obviated by their bumbling and incompetent natures.
