        "mainbody": "'''Azdraka''' was a [[green dragon]] who was slain by Lady [[Tanamere Alagondar]] and several [[adventurer]]s in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Azdraka terrorized the [[High Road]] south of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], prompting Lady Tanamere, a member of Neverwinter's royal family, to rally two parties of adventurers to slay the dragon. While they succeeded in killing Azdraka, four of the adventurers died in the fight, along with Lady Tanamere's squire and her [[horse]], and Lady Tanamere herself succumbed to her wounds soon after. At her royal bidding, all of the fallen were laid to rest alongside Azdraka's bones in a [[Dragon Barrow|dragon-shaped barrow]] near the site of the battle.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, most common folk seemed to have forgotten both Azdraka's and Lady Tanamere's names, but some still recalled the legend of their battle and the location of their shared tomb."
