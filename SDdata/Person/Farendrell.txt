'''Lord Farendrell''' was an inhabitant of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} the Leylandâ€“Nightstalker wedding took place. Dame [[Jenilynn Leyland]], a [[Knight]] of the [[Right Hand of Tyr]], and Sir [[Sarren Nightstalker]], a [[Knight of the Griffon]], were united in a social gala that was reported in the pages of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]''. Lord Farendrell was one of the attendants to the groom, alongside [[Harker Sorrel]] and [[Alexander Thorin]]. It was reported that the wedding was scheduled for an earlier date, but Jenilynn Leyland was delayed by her mission to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and being transformed into a [[unicorn]].
