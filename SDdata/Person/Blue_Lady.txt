The '''Blue Lady''' was a [[spellplague]]-changed [[sirine]] worshiped by [[the Choir]] cult.

==History==
The Blue Lady was a sirine that was transmuted by the Spellplague. Twisted, she resided in [[Tohrepur]]. There, prior to [[1473 DR]], she transformed the farmer [[Khault]], who was fleeing from his destroyed village, into an [[aberration]] and he gathered a cult around her.

In [[1479 DR]], Khault sent members to [[Airspur]] to recruit. The Choir kidnapped several residents of Airspur, including the twin sister of a [[genasi]] named [[Ghaelya]] who the cult believed to be a prophetess. With the help of [[Uthalion]] and a few of his friends, Ghaelya traveled to Tohrepur, where one of her friends killed Khault and destroyed the Blue Lady.
