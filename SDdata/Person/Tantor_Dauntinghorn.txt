'''Tantor Dauntinghorn''' was an envoy of King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, he was sent by his king to [[Shadowdale]] to support the dale against [[Zhentil Keep]], at the invitation of Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra|Mourngrym]]. However, the Cormyrean crown also wanted to learn about the death of [[Elminster]] and for this he argued with the [[War Wizard]] delegate [[Luthtor]] of [[Suzail]] and [[Shaerl Amcathra|Shaerl Mourngrym]], but they were revealed to be the [[malaugrym]]s [[Argast]] and [[Amdramnar]] in disguise.
