Percival Gallard Woodehouse, also known as Pig, was a famous chef in Skullport.
Percival was a famous chef in Waterdeep until Denver Gilliam hired him to work at the Traitor Picks. Under him, the tavern earned a good reputation.
However, Percival was convinced to assist Volothamp Geddarm in one of his trips into the Underdark. During his absence, Denver fired and replaced him. In 1370 DR, back in Skullport, Percival was without a job.
