Bundrigo Dalastarra was a halfling man of the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast. In the mid–14th century DR, he held the civic official position of the Regent of City Works and the heraldic office of The Ravencoat, but proved rampantly corrupt.
Bundrigo was cheerful and good-natured, though also considered sly.
Bundrigo Dalastarra held the position of Regent of City Works in Ravens Bluff for a number of years. In that position, he operated a huge and well-oiled system of bribery, kickbacks, and informers, the greatest ever known in Ravens Bluff. He paid his hardworking officials well, though some believed the money ultimately came from pirates.
Bundrigo died during Ravens Bluffs war with Myrkyssa Jelan in the summer of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, though he was nowhere near the fighting. An unknown killer hacked him multiple times with a heavy bladed weapon, then left his body as a heap of smoldering ashes.
Scandal erupted as all Bundrigos crimes were uncovered, with all his closest aides and associates implicated in his misdeeds. Lord Chancellor Arvin Kothonos had a difficult time finding anyone in the Regency with any experience who wasnt tainted by Bundrigos web of corruption. Finally, Kothonos appointed the low-ranking but honest Lastraeya Indomurr as Acting Regent. She soon overhauled the Regency and left not even a whiff of corruption.
