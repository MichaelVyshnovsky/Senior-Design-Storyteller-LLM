Shaddara the Fair was the most famous queen of Anauria.
Shaddara was a child queen who became a legend of her time. She grew up to become a great hunter and often killed monsters in the Hunters Hills. 
A number of natural landmarks in Anauria were named for the young queen, including the Shaddan Hills and Mount Shaddath (known later as Rausrawna), the westernmost peak of the Desertsmouth Mountains. 
She was said to have been interred within a crypt beneath a temple of Jergal in the capital city of Amazandar, though this was untrue. The crypt mere housed a portal that led to the Dungeon of Swords far to the west.
