'''Maggarl Helck''' was a [[Red Plumes]] commander in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|5}}

==Activities==
Maggarl managed the [[Waydown]] garrison. He also led a smuggling ring. Only he had the key to the Waydown and knew the magic word to stop the [[golem]] guardian. Usually he did nothing, relying on his sergeants to handle most of the garrison's affairs.

==History==
Maggarl rose through the Red Plumes' ranks thanks to his father.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Maggarl replaced [[Vuhm Yestral]] as commander of the garrison at the entrance of the Waydown. He used his position to become rich off smuggling.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|5}}

At one point, however, a giant [[octopus]] attacked one of his river expeditions and dragged away two mercenaries, which worried Maggarl.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|9}}

Felratha instead planned to smuggle goods to [[Szith Morcane]] without Maggarl's knowledge. She and the adventuring party she had hired silently entered his quarters at night in order to find the key and the magic word. Possibly under the auspices of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], they may have also tried to find proof of his corruption.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|14}}

==Personality==
Maggarl was the perfect product of racism, nepotism, and bootlicking. He was a pompous man, always interested more in appearance than reality. He always tried to steer conversations toward his own accomplishments.

==Relationship==
Maggarl's father was a rich merchant in [[Hillsfar]].
