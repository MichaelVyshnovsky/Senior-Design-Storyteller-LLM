Maggarl Helck was a Red Plumes commander in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Maggarl managed the Waydown garrison. He also led a smuggling ring. Only he had the key to the Waydown and knew the magic word to stop the golem guardian. Usually he did nothing, relying on his sergeants to handle most of the garrisons affairs.
Maggarl rose through the Red Plumes ranks thanks to his father.
Circa 1486 DR, Maggarl replaced Vuhm Yestral as commander of the garrison at the entrance of the Waydown. He used his position to become rich off smuggling.
At one point, however, a giant octopus attacked one of his river expeditions and dragged away two mercenaries, which worried Maggarl.
Felratha instead planned to smuggle goods to Szith Morcane without Maggarls knowledge. She and the adventuring party she had hired silently entered his quarters at night in order to find the key and the magic word. Possibly under the auspices of the Order of the Gauntlet, they may have also tried to find proof of his corruption.
Maggarl was the perfect product of racism, nepotism, and bootlicking. He was a pompous man, always interested more in appearance than reality. He always tried to steer conversations toward his own accomplishments.
Maggarls father was a rich merchant in Hillsfar.
