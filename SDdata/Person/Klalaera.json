Klalaera herded them back towards the ruin, apparently slaying Dreadspell [[Femter Deldrannus]] to convince them. They were interrupted by [[Starsunder]] and [[Umbregard]] appearing and attacking them; during the chaos of battle, Dreadspell [[Daluth]] slew Klalaera. However, her body animated and spoke with Darklady Avroana's voice, attacking Elryn. Moments later, Klalaera's body was destroyed by the intervention of [[Tenthar Taerhamoos]]."
