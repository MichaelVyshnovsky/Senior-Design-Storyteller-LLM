        "mainbody": "Mistmyr Iroan () was a sorcerer and tavern keeper in Waterdeep in 1374 DR.\nMistmyr was a skinny Tethyrian man with thinning hair pulled back into a pony tail. He had amber-colored eyes and usually wore rumpled clothing or wizards robes.\nMistmyr talked very loudly, especially when he was very excited or nervous.\nMistmyr worked as a wizard-for-hire for a decade, raising himself from bitter poverty, until a dead friend left him a tavern. The tavern was in the Castle Ward, and was formerly called the Crows Nest, which Mistmyr renamed to Azuths Mug.\nMystmur proved to be a good tavern owner, and at the same time met and befriended Lord Hulraven Irlingstar. In 1374 DR, Lord Hulraven asked Mistmyr to use his magic help to find the kidnappers of his wife.\nMystmyr continued to cast spells for associates and tutored mages when he was not busy running his tavern.\nMystmyr kept a room at the Splintered Stair in the Dock Ward, but he spent most of his time at his tavern."
