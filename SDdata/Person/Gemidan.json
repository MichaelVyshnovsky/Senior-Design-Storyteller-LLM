        "mainbody": "'''Gemidan''' was a young [[wizard]] who in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] briefly served as apprentice to [[Khelben Arunsun]].\n{{quote|...the most remarkable intuitive grasp of magic I've seen in years.|Khelben on Gemidan's abilities}}",
        "Description": "Gemidan had a freckled face and bright red hair. He wore the usual garb of a non-magical apprentice.",
        "Personality": "Gemidan was arrogant and cocksure of his own abilities. He was prone to acting rashly.",
        "Possessions": "Gemidan carried a [[holy symbol]] of [[Azuth]] around his neck, which he often clutched at when he became nervous. Gemidan also wore ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and a ''[[ring of spell storing]]''. They were gifts from [[Laeral Silverhand]] to protect him on his adventures in the [[Savage Frontier]].",
        "Activities": "Gemidan learned well under the tutelage of Khelben and Laeral, even creating his own [[spell]]s based on others: ''[[Gemidan's icicle]]'' was a variant of ''[[Snilloc's snowball]]'', ''[[Lightning bug (spell)|lightning bug]]'' was his combination of ''[[magic missile]]'' and ''[[shocking grasp]]'', and ''[[Gemidan's paralytic missile]]'' another variant on ''magic missile'' that was discovered by accident.",
        "Relationships": "Although Gemidan was a particularly young apprentice, Khelben was impressed by Gemidan's determination and skill. Laeral Silverhand also cared for Gemidan, and was concerned for his future as an adventurer.\n\nAfter leaving Waterdeep, he was a member of the [[Knights of the Sword Coast]], along with [[Donar Heremet]], [[Jan Hunabar]], [[Kharkos]], [[Lauhren]] and [[Owen]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, at age 6, Gemidan appeared before [[Blackstaff Tower]], demanding to become Khelben's apprentice. Khelben accepted and Gemidan began training under the Blackstaff and Laeral Silverhand. By [[Higharvestide]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Gemidan had become a member of the reestablished Knights of the Sword Coast. He left Waterdeep and his apprenticeship behind for adventures with his party in the [[Savage Frontier]]."
