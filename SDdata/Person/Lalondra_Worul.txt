'''Lalondra Worul''' reigned for decades as [[Shar]]'s high priestess.

==Biography==
Lalondra was a young [[Church of Shar|Sharran]] when she began receiving visions in her dreams from her goddess of the location of a sacred relic, ''[[Gorothir's Girdle]]''. Circa [[617 DR]], Lalondra took the ''Girdle'' from its former owner, whom Shar had turned into a tortured [[undead]] thing. With the power and authority that the ''Girdle'' provided, Lalondra created the [[True Servants of Shar]], whose members, all capable devotees of Shar, came to rule her clergy all along the [[Sword Coast]] for the next eighty years.

Lalondra had used powerful magic to bind the True Servants lives to her own and when she successfully pursued [[lich]]dom in [[697 DR]], that magic snuffed out their life forces, effectively leaving their followers leaderless. Riots ensued in twelve cities

Selfishly, Lalondra ventured into the [[Underdark]] but Shar, furious with her formerly favored servant, stripped Lalondra of all of her power, which left her a much easier target when she was attacked by an alliance of [[drow]] from [[Eryndlyn]] and [[illithilich]]es, who absconded with the ''Girdle'' once Lalondra had been destroyed.<ref>
