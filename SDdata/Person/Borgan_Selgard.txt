'''Borgan Selgard''' was a [[mercenary]] leader in the year [[1375 DR]].

==Description==
Borgan was a grizzled man with gray hair and a short beard.

==History==
Borgan was a veteran mercenary and the leader of a mercenary company, the [[Skull and Club]], founded long before by a [[cleric]] of [[Myrkul]].

In 1375 DR, they were recruited by the [[Zhentarim]] who'd occupied [[Shadowdale]]. They attacked and destroyed the village of [[Oakwood Knoll]] with [[The Teeth (mercenaries)|the Teeth]] mercenaries. Later, the two mercenary groups argued about the spoils.
