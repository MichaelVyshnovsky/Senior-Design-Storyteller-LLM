'''Chathuulandroth''' was a [[green dragon]] in the [[Eastern Shaar]].

==History==
At a young age, Chathuulandroth razed the tower of [[Nezram]] in [[681 DR]] and then flew off with most of the treasure that was held within to the mountainous regions west of it.

Later in [[921 DR]], Chathuulandroth slayed the fifth [[pharaoh]] of [[Mulhorand]], [[Horuseres II]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-03 - Kings of Mulhorand}}

At some point Chathuulandroth mated with another dragon, creating the offspring [[Skuthosiin]].<ref>
