Chathuulandroth was a green dragon in the Eastern Shaar.
At a young age, Chathuulandroth razed the tower of Nezram in 681 DR and then flew off with most of the treasure that was held within to the mountainous regions west of it.
Later in 921 DR, Chathuulandroth slayed the fifth pharaoh of Mulhorand, Horuseres II.
At some point Chathuulandroth mated with another dragon, creating the offspring Skuthosiin.
