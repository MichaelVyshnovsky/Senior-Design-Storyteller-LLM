        "mainbody": "Grand Overseer '''Vidorus''' was one of the leaders of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "History": "Vidorus reported directly to [[Kya Mordrayn]], the [[Wearers of Purple|Wearer of Purple]] in charge of the Cult's operations in the ruins of the [[elf|elven]] city. During that time, the Grand Overseer beheaded Overseer [[Fanraet]] for his failure to deal with the members of the [[Sisterhood of Silver Fire]] who tried to defend Myth Drannor from the invading forces. Vidorus sent Fanraet's head as a dire warning to the Overseer [[Sinod]] who was to take care of a group of rebellious [[orog]] mercenaries."
