        "History": "Not long after the death of [[Mystra]] (in [[1385 DR]]), the [[cambion]] [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and his companions were captured by the [[marilith]] [[Vhissilka]], who served Lord Axithar. Vhok abandoned his companions and allied with Axithar, providing information about the weaknesses of the House of the Triad so that Vhok could get his revenge for his treatment by the [[angel]] [[Tauran]] and so that he could reach the [[Lifespring]], which he believed would give him the power to rule [[Sundabar]] as a glorious leader. Axithar's horde of [[demon]]s invaded the plane and were nearing victory against the angels when [[Bahamut]]'s legions appeared and defeated the demon armies."
