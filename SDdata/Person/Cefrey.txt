'''Cefrey''' was a [[spellcaster]] and looter who was active on the [[Sword Coast]] region during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. For a time, she worked under the employ of [[Gimblebock]].

==Description==
She had long dark hair, wore a simple traveling [[robe]], and carried a [[quarterstaff]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Cefrey and her fellow looters had been trying to break into a [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|crypt]] for a few days. They had made some progress, and had encountered [[skeleton]]s. Not wanting to go home empty-handed yet again, she was determined to get further in.
