        "mainbody": "'''Galvendo''' was a hunter of the city of [[Mirabar]] who operated a [[Galvendo' Lodge|hunting lodge]] named after himself.\n\nAlong with utilizing very aggressive advertising for his lodge, Galvendo claimed that no one had ever died on one of his expeditions. The truth, however, was that three clients had met a grizzly demise while hunting with Galvendo (typically by a [[bear]] or [[winter wolf]]). These deceased few were then resurrected by Galvendo's companion [[Deathcalm|Deathcalm the Loved]] by means of a ''[[raise dead]]'' spell."
