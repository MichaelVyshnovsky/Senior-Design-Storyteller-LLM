'''Chivin''' was a [[drow]] spy from [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], Chivin was one of the many spies sent from an alliance of noble houses of Menzoberranzan to observe the [[elf]] [[wizard]] [[Etherik]], who was plotting to kill every drow of the [[Underdark]] using a new kind of [[construct]]. During his investigation Chivin discovered that one of the houses planned to betray the others. However, he was captured by Etherik and put in the wizard's dungeon together with another drow, [[Shalice]].
