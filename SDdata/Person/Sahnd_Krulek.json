        "History": "Sahnd was a [[Knight of the Black Fist]] in [[Phlan]]. However, a day after arresting a powerful noble, he was framed and later sentenced to death, having been falsely accused of plotting to assassinate Lord Regent [[Ector Brahms]]. A group of fellow Black Fists, knowing Krulek's innocence, secretly freed him and spirited him away from the city.\n\nIn order to get vengeance against the noble, Sahnd founded the [[Gray Patriots]] bandit group. Initially, they tried to act honorably and not harm innocent people, but they occasionally descended into barbarity.\n\nIn 1489 DR, another bandit group arrived in the area, the [[Claws of Tiamat]] led by the [[sorcerer]] [[Jeralla]]. Sahnd offered to meet with her in order to negotiate an alliance.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|5}} However, the meeting was attacked by both a warband of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], which wanted to kill the heretical Jeralla, and by an adventuring party hired to clear the [[Iron Route]] of outlaws. In the fighting, Sahnd was defeated.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|21}}\n\nAround [[1492 DR]] he was in jail on Phlan when the reclamation army led by [[Jhessail Greycastle]] attacked the city. Some adventurers tried to recruit him for the battle.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|119-120}}"
