        "History": "Many years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Huang Chih-Wei was a simple healer who was contemporary to [[Nan Kung Chi]]. The man named Nan Kung Chi was also known as the Black Leopard and he held significant amount of power. Huang Chih-Wei was a strong woman and refused to kneel before the Leopard to which the man retaliated. The same thing happened to Huang Chih-Wei that happened to all who threatened men in power. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Huang Chih-Wei's story was still remembered by some, including a [[vampire]] treasure hunter named [[Hexxat]]."
