Jalobal was a customer at the Fair Maid of Ripplestones in the midâ€“8 century DR.
The man was effusive and fond of table-talk.
When the elven wizard Ilbryn Starym passed through Ripplestones in early-to-mid-spring of the , he tried to ask Baerdagh and Caladaster Daermree, who were just outside the Fair Maid tavern, about the whereabouts of Elminster Aumar. They did not respond, but a man at the door, introducing himself as Jalobal, blabbed instantly and told him all about the Dead Place where Elminster had gone, east of Ripplestones. Despite Jalobals warnings, Ilbryn just showed them the wounds on his side, and then went off. Jalobal went back in to tell everyone about it.
