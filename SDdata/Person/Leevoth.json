        "History": "At first, Leevoth studied to be a wizard, but soon realized his love for war and fighting and decided to train as a warrior. Leevoth proved skillful and efficient, and eventually he became the captain of the city's guard. His duty was to maintain order in the city and he eventually suppressed any kind of dissent in the streets, from thieves to rogue arcanists.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Leevoth led three-hundred elite Shadovar warriors to [[Sakkors]]. On [[Uktar 30]], Leevoth and his elite troops from Sakkors arrived at [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]] during the [[Battle of Selgaunt]] and attacked the [[Saerloon]] army.",
        "Personality": "Leevoth was a very zealous individual and stoically served all [[Princes of Shade]] and [[Hadrhune]] with the same loyalty.",
        "Possessions": "Leevoth possessed a powerful magic sword, ''[[Ironfang (sword)|Ironfang]]'', which was particularly lethal against shades. It was rumored that it was created by a prince of the city, who was later killed by Hadrhune for an unknown reason."
