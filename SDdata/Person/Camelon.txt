Camelon was one of the Squires of the Order of Tye, an elite organization dedicated to guarding the members of the Lords Alliance circa 1372 DR.
Camelon was a young human man who wore azure blue colors of his order.
In 1372 DR, Square Camelon, along with Squire Blancheflor and Squire Launfal were close to achieving full knighthood with the Order of Tye, leaving only the final Knights Trial to be completed. The trio of squires was sent to the Lonely Barrens of the Delimbiyr Vale, to slay the feared beast - the Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor. When the squires entered its lair, the sentient rat lured them to the "dining room" inside its cavern and sent a swarm of hungry vermin to devour the young knights.
The trio escaped certain death but the experience left them traumatized, terrified, and panicked. Camelon was crippled by fear, unable to utter even the simplest sentences. By stroke of luck the Hero of Daggerford happened upon the distraught knights-to-be and agreed to help slaying the horrific creature. The Hero was successful in ridding the land of MRCDs ferocious swarm. The Hero, however, did not slay the rat. Instead, the creature was convinced to surrender itself to the squires and be taken to Waterdeep as a prisoner. When the Hero brought the sentient vermin out, wrapped in a piece of cloth, Camelon snapped put of his shock, seeing how timid the Mighty Rat was on its own, and even felt compassion for the brain-eating critter.
Squires thanked the Hero, and departed the Lonely Barrens in anticipation of being knighted and treated as brave heroes.
