'''Holordrym''', born in the [[242 DR|Year of the Hunting Horn, 242 DR]], was the 21st [[Obarskyr]] monarch and a king of [[Cormyr]]. He reigned for four years, from the [[268 DR|Year of Cruel Storms, 268 DR]] to the time of his death in the [[272 DR|Year of the Weeping Kingdom, 272 DR]].

== Relatives ==
Although his sister [[Besmra Obarskyr|Besmra]] eventually reigned as queen after the deaths of his sons, [[Belereve Obarskyr|Belereve]] and [[Thargram Obarskyr|Thargram]], he was the first and only son and heir of [[Thargreve Obarskyr the Lesser|King Thargreve the Lesser]].

He was two when his granduncle [[Boldovar Obarskyr|Boldovar the Mad]] was believed to have died; twenty-six when he inherited the throne from his cousin, [[Roderin Obarskyr|Roderin the Bastard]] after his passing; and thirty when he drew his last.
