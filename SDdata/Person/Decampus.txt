Lady '''Decampus''', who became known as the Singing Lady, was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and a [[bard]] who developed the ''[[alarm]]'' spell.

==Description==
Decampus was a skilled [[spellcaster]], though she wasn't as smart nor as interested in [[magic]] as a lot of her peers.

==Possessions==
Lady Decampus owned a [[mithral]] [[harp]] that was given to her by the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]].

==Activities==
The arcanist-bard was caring of others and traveled around [[Netheril]] with her bardic apprentices. Together, they listened to the stories of villagers and even used their magical prowess to aid these small communities. Due to these acts, she became known as the Singing Lady.

==History==
Decampus was born in {{YearlinkConvert|2277|NY}}. At the young age of thirteen, the talented arcanist developed the ''alarm'' spell. After this, she travelled to the well-known enclaves of [[Ioulaum (enclave)|Ioulaum]] and [[Seventon]] to study at the universities there. However, she became weary of the conflicts between the power-hungry arcanists. Thus, in {{YearlinkConvert|2363|NY}}, she left Ioulaum's enclave and became a wanderer. In a spell battle with archwizard [[Delzjhava]], the Singing Lady died in {{YearlinkConvert|2693|NY}} at the old age of 416.
