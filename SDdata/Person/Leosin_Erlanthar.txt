'''Leosin Erlanthar''' was a [[monk]] from [[Berdusk]], the master of [[Nesim Waladra]]. and a member of the [[Harpers]] who researched the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Severin Silrajin]] during the late 1480s [[DR]].

==History==
Leosin noted the unusual actions of the Cult of the Dragon and decided to investigate the matter. In [[Greenest]], he permitted the cultists to capture him in order to examine them more closely.
