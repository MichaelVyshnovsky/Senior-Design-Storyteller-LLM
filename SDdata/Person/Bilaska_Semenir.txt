'''Bilaska Semenir''' was a [[Trader (Shining South)|trader]] who inhabited the [[Shining South]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Bilaska was a master of her craft and proud of it. Originally from [[Prastuil]] in [[Dambrath]], she would travel anywhere in [[Faer√ªn]] or beyond in order to make a profit. She even crossed the [[Sea of Swords]] to conduct business in [[Maztica]] and planned to visit [[Zakhara]] next.

She once supplied a crashed [[elven]] [[spelljamming]] ship even though she did not share a language with them. In exchange she received a dozen [[gemstone]]s that had never been seen on [[Toril]].

==Possessions==
She carried an [[enchanted]] [[shortsword]].
