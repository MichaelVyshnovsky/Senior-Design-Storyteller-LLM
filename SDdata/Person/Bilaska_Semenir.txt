Bilaska Semenir was a trader who inhabited the Shining South during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Bilaska was a master of her craft and proud of it. Originally from Prastuil in Dambrath, she would travel anywhere in Faer√ªn or beyond in order to make a profit. She even crossed the Sea of Swords to conduct business in Maztica and planned to visit Zakhara next.
She once supplied a crashed elven spelljamming ship even though she did not share a language with them. In exchange she received a dozen gemstones that had never been seen on Toril.
She carried an enchanted shortsword.
