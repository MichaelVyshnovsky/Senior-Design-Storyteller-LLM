'''Tamia Holzt''' was a Black Gauntlet of [[Bane]] and an Overseer slaver who served the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Tamia was a light-skinned [[human]] woman who wore her decorated [[Banite]] Black Gauntlet [[armor]] that included a [[breastplate]], pauldrons decorated with a hellish face, and a large and intimidating [[helmet]], decorated with a pair of metal tusks and a big image of Bane's black hand. Uva was armed with an ''[[infernal mace]]'' that bore a ''+2'' [[enchantment]]. She also carried ''[[Prinski's Motivator]]'' to keep her finger on the slave kill-switch.

==Abilities==
Black Gauntlet Holzt used [[divine]] magic granted to her by Bane. She had access to a variety of [[spell]]s, including: ''[[aura of terror]]'', ''[[blight]]'', ''[[dominate person]]'', ''[[inflict wounds]]'', ''[[phantasmal killer]]'', and ''[[planar ally]].''

==Relationships==
Tamia enjoyed a dominant role in her sexual proclivities. She kept a detailed record of her sexual activities with the certain "BD" in a journal she titled ''Tamia Domina'', checking off positions from ''[[Quarta Sune]]''. Another sexual partner of Tamia's was [[Clovia Throaks]], wife of [[Blarson Throaks]], and mother of [[Gasper Throaks]], whom Tamia recruited into the cult. Clovia planned on leaving her husband for Tamia.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Gondian]] foundry of [[Baldur's Gate]] was taken over by [[Enver Gortash]] and his cultists of Bane. Gondian foundry workers were forced to work on forging the lord's [[steel watcher]]s. Their families and loved ones were abducted and held hostage to encourage obedience, and all of the workers were outfitted with ''[[incineration collar]]s''  controlled by ''Prinski's Motivators.''

During the [[Absolute crisis]], [[Lowa]], one of the enslaved foundry workers, stood up to Black Gauntlet Tamia Holzt, stating that the watchers' gyronetics required workers with steady hands and sharp eyes, not exhausted slaves with trembling muscles. Lowa demanded rest from her captors but was reminded of her son, who was held hostage underwater at the sunken [[Iron Throne headquarters]]. Faced with the threat of her own death and the death of her son, Lowa promised to finish the steel watchers by the first light of dawn.

Tamia Holzt's fate following the crisis' resolution remained unconfirmed but it was presumed she was killed by a group of adventurers who stood against the [[Absolute]] and tried to rescue the hostages.
