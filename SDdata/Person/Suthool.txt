'''Suthool''' was a [[mind flayer]] who was involved in the plot to assassinate the [[Lords of Waterdeep#Masked Lords|Masked Lords]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Suthool always took a practical approach, doing what he perceived as necessary for his business. He possessed a sharp tongue and a dry sense of humor.

==Abilities==
As a mind flayer, he possessed potent [[psionic]] abilities. He was able to read minds and communicate telepathically with ease. He could also launch powerful psionic assaults, such as ''[[mind blast]]s'' that could stun their targets. His more powerful attacks could completely destroy their target's mind, as he did to [[Faerrel Dunblade]].

==Possessions==
He possessed a magical [[gorget]] that allowed him to speak humanoid tongues.

==Activities==
He was a trader, specializing in [[drug]]s, [[poison]]s, and their antidotes. When he came to Waterdeep, he became involved with the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar Guild]].

==Relationships==
He worked alongside [[Belvarra Bowmantle]] in service to the [[Xanathar (Zushaxx)|Xanathar]], and the illithid and the worshiper of [[Asmodeus]] appeared to genuinely care for one another.

Under the Xanathar's orders, Suthool and Belvarra aided Lord [[Braethan Cazondur]]'s plot to assassinate Masked Lords of Waterdeep, although the Xanathar eventually decided that Cazondur had gone too far and ordered Suthool to kill the treacherous lord.

==History==
Suthool dwelt in the [[Underdark]], where he was an infamous merchant dealing in drugs, poisons, and their antidotes. ''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], owing to disturbances in the Underdark, he came to Waterdeep in the hope of establishing connections with humanoids on the surface world. There he became involved with the Xanathar.

In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, on the orders of the Xanathar, Suthool and an agent of Asmodeus named [[Belvarra Bowmantle]] discreetly aided [[Braethan Cazondur]]'s plot to assassinate Masked Lords of Waterdeep in order to fill their seats on the council with his supporters. Eventually, Xanathar decided that Cazondur had gone too far and ordered Bowmantle and Suthool to kill him. The pair arrived at the [[Palace of Waterdeep]] where Cazondur was attempting to unseat [[Lords of Waterdeep#Open Lord|Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]]. After killing Cazondur, they threatened to unleash a plague on Waterdeep if anyone pursued them. As they attempted to flee the chaotic assembly in the palace, several of Suthool's tentacles were severed by Faerrel Dunblade. Suthool lashed out with his psionic power to break the young adventurer's mind. Before he could escape, Suthool's own mind was assaulted by Lady Silverhand's [[Weave]] powers and he was taken into custody by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]. Belvarra Bowmantle, however, escaped and swore to free Suthool and restore his mind, much to the approval of Asmodeus.
