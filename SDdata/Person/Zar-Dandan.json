        "mainbody": "Zar-Dandan, who was also called the Wanderer or Gold-Teeth, was a half-elven traveler in the Hordelands in 1367 DR.\nZar-Dandan earned his nickname of Gold-Teeth for the many gold-capped teeth lining his mouth.\nThough roguish, Zar-Dandan was charming and likable. He enjoyed sharing entertaining stories with fellow travelers, so long as they had nothing to do with his past, of which he was quite secretive.\nZar-Dandan owned a ring of jumping, a potion of fire resistance, and a magical sword and shield.\nZar-Dandans father was killed by a man named Rukn, whom he searched relentlessly for across the breadth of the Hordelands with the hopes of slitting his throat in his sleep."
