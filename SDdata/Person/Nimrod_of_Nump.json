His magical items, similarly, lay lost in certain treasure hoards and vaults, usually as a defence mechanism against such adventurers.\n\nSome of the ''cylindrical scrolls'' came into the possession of several adventuring companies and those who survived chose to collect them together and secure them safely away from the world. The [[wizard]] [[Elkwhisker]] later discovered this trove of ''cylindrical scrolls'', hidden in a dumpster behind the House of Out in the Kingdom of Slumdudgeon. Who knows how they got there.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = It must not be supposed that all the mages of old were wise, clever, or even mentally competent.\n| source = Elkwhisker on Nimrod\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\n''Circa'' 1989 CE, Elkwhisker visited [[Earth]] and put occasional [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'' magazine]] contributor [[John M. Maxstadt]] to sleep telling him about Nimrod of Nump."

An amazing side-effect, likely unintentional, was that spells inscribed on the scroll stayed there forever, no matter how often they were cast or copied. A terrible side-effect was that spells inscribed on the scroll stayed there forever, no matter how often they were cast or copied. This was because Nimrod neglected to include descriptions of spell effects and the circular nature of the scroll joined one spell to another, so casting them was liable to be catastrophic.",
