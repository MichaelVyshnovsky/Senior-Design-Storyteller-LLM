        "Personality": "He spent most of his time tutoring the children of wealthy Waterdhavian families, a task he seemed to find excruciatingly boring. Rhinzen abused the narcotic [[haepthum]].",
        "Possessions": "He held the [[Songdragon's gorget]], a [[magic|magical]] item that nullified the effects of Waterdeep's [[Ahghairon's dragonward|''dragonward'']].",
        "History": "[[Tennora Hedare]], a former pupil, stole the gorget but was caught in the act by Rhinzen. However, he was so intoxicated on haepthum that he mistook Tennora and two other apprentices for [[devils]] and called down a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' on his tower. The tower was destroyed but Rhinzen survived, and was then relieved of his role as Master of the House of Wonder.",
        "Description": "Rhinzen had blonde hair and turquoise eyes."
