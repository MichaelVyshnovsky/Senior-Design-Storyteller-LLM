'''Korock''' was an [[orc]] warrior during the late 15th century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1484 DR]], during the orc and [[drow]] assault on the [[Silver Marches]], Korock was guiding a contingent of troops. [[Regis]] used the name of this orc in order to deceive the shamans [[Kllug]] and [[Innanig]], who were marching toward [[Nesm√©]]. He said that Korock had angered their drow allies.
