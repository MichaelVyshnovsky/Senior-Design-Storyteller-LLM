'''Mester Rauvaraudo''' was the majordomo of the [[Sign of the Shield]] inn located in [[Voonlar]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He was known as Master Mester to everyone that knew him.
__NOTOC__
==Description==
Mester's most prominent feature was his sad, deep-set brown eyes. His hair was also brown and he sported a beard and mustache that was fading with age. He had small hands and delicate features.

==Personality==
Master Mester was a mild man, but scurried about with alacrity as he supervised the dozens of people working in the inn.

==Abilities==
Rauvaraudo was a natural [[sorcerer]] but not very advanced. He only used his magic in front of other people in response to extreme emergencies.

==Possessions==
He owned a ''[[wand of hold person]]'' and a ''[[ring of the ram]]'' that he utilized when the rare brawl broke out, or a guest became completely unruly.

==Activities==
Master Mester was in charge of the entire staff&mdash;nearly forty chambermaids, footmen, and cooks&mdash;of the Sign of the Shield, although he delegated most of the supervision to his two chatelaines, [[Amratha Shuldeiroun]] and [[Maeragra Duskwinter]], while he saw to the menu, larder, wine cellar, and everything else it took to run a luxury inn.
