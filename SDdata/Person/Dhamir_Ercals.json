        "History": "Dhamir led the [[Second Banedeath]] in Darkhold, purging all non-Cyric followers. Impressed, [[Sememmon]] offered Dhamir command of the keep, which he quickly accepted, becoming the leader of the Cyricist Zhents there. But Dhamir's aims were greater: he wanted to assume control of the [[Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse]] and use them to advance in the Zhent hierarchy. He also started plotting an evil crusade against eastern powers like [[Mulhorand]] and [[Iyachtu Xvim]]."
