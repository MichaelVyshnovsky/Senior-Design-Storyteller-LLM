'''Burlane''' was the leader of the [[Company of the Bright Spear]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
By Flamerule 1374 DR, Burlane wore numerous golden rings and earrings; his belt and throat also sported gold, presumably as part of a belt buckle and a necklace. He was square-bearded, large, and youthful.

==Personality==
He drank a lot.

==Possessions==
He carried the [[Bright Spear]], eponymous to the company.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|23-24|1}}

==Relationships==
He was the leader of the [[Company of the Bright Spear]]. Through most situations, he asked for all his companions' opinions.

==History==
Before [[Mirtul 6]] of {{yearlink|1374}}, Burlane was already the leader of the [[Company of the Bright Spear]]. He had visited places before, at least one of which was [[Suzail]], and the company had a charter from King [[Azoun IV]].{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|25-30|2}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005||2}}

On that date, during the company's stop in [[Highmoon]], where they stopped at [[the Rising Moon (inn)|the Rising Moon]], the company's skulker, [[Lynxal]], was slain by a local veteran, [[Ghondarrath]], after trying to stab the old warrior, who had caught him pickpocketing; though the situation almost deteriorated into a full-on carnage, the timely intervention of the innkeeper, [[Gorstag]], prevented it.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|20-21|1}} After they retreated to their chambers for the evening, they found much of their valuables stolen; a lass at the inn, [[Shandril Shessair]], revealed herself as the thief, and asked to become their next thief.

They accepted; over the next days, Burlane led them to [[Myth Drannor]], and on the evening of [[Mirtul 12]]{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|33-39|2}} He rescued her afterwards when the men she was pursuing caught her.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|43|2}}

During the fighting once they found the area towards which the mule train was headed, the Company of the Bright Spear fought a magician sentry, protecting a stronghold belonging to the [[Cult of the Dragon]] at the [[Gates of Doom]], at [[Oversember Vale]], on [[Mirtul 20]], where they were ambushed. In the fight, Burlane was slain by a [[green dragon]]'s breath, after a spell from the sentry entangled him in sticky strands, almost certainly being a ''[[web]]'' spell. [[Delg]] confirmed his demise at a later date.
