'''Zz'Pzora''' was a two-headed [[deep dragon]] who lived near the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the [[Underdark]]. She was a friend of the [[wizard]] [[Liriel Baenre]], and died helping Liriel fight a mercenary band in [[Skullport]].

==Description==
Her most distinctive feature was her two, horned heads, the result of exposure to the ''[[faerzress]]'' of the Underdark. At roughly fifty feet in size, Zz'Pzora was smaller than most other deep dragons. Her scales were iridescent, glowing purple,{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|1076}} and her wings were [[amethyst]] in color.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|5351}}

==Personality==
Zz'Pzora's two heads each had their own distinct personality. The left head longed for travel, adventure, and visiting cities both in the Underdark and on the surface. This head was somewhat flighty and vain, and prone to sudden bouts of sheer delight. The personality of the right head was more traditionally draconic, possessing a calculating, dry wit, and a love of treasure and solitude. The two heads were constantly at odds with each other, which gave Zz'Pzora's persona a tinge of madness and unpredictability.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|1101-1104}}

==Lair==
[[Zz'Pzora's lair]] was located a handful of miles south of Menzoberranzan, in a hidden grotto that could only be accessed by navigating the side channels of the treacherous [[Cascades]] river. The difficulty of reaching her lair kept Zz'Pzora safe from the drow, in spite of her proximity to one of their major cities.

The grotto itself was riddled with smaller caves, and was suffused in powerful ''faerzress'' to the point that it said to be the most potent source of the magical radiation in the vicinity of Menzoberranzan. The magical radiation diminshed when Liriel Baenre removed the Banshee's Needle&mdash;a stone that served as the focal point of the ''faerzress'' in the area.

==Relationships==
She was good friends with Liriel Baenre, a free-spirited drow wizard who occasionally visited the dragon's lair, and affectionately referred to Zz'Pzora as "'''Zip'''".{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|1091}} Though neither drow nor deep dragons were known for their honorable nature, the two enjoyed each other's company, if somewhat warily.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|2890}}

==History==
Before Zz'Pzora was born, her mother battled a drow [[banshee]] in the cave that would come to serve as their lair. It was possible that the intense magical energy expended in this battle contributed to Zz'Pzora's two-headed mutation.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|2847}}

By the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], Zz'Pzora had befriended Liriel Baenre.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|1111}} The young drow collected the deep dragon's discarded scales, a lucrative commodity,{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|1116}} and stored several magical items in the ''faerzress''-filled cavern to boost their potency.

Two years later, in the [[1361 DR|Year of Maiden, 1361 DR]], Zz'Pzora helped Liriel pry loose the Banshee's Needle. The young wizard hoped to use the ''faerzress''-filled stone to store her innate drow powers in the ''[[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]]'' amulet, allowing her to live and travel on the surface.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|2871}} In return, Zz'Pzora asked Liriel to help her reach the surface, to which the drow agreed.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|2886}}

Not long after, the ''Windwalker'' fell into the clutches of the [[Dragon's Hoard]] mercenary band in Skullport. Since the mercenaries enjoyed the support of the deep dragon [[Pharx]], Liriel enlisted the aid of Zz'Pzora.{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|5141}} The deep dragon followed her friend through a ''[[portal]]'' to Skullport, where she seduced Pharx to distract him from aiding the mercenaries in battle. While Liriel and her allies fought the Dragon's Hoard, Zz'Pzora had sex with Pharx,{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|5272}} before suddenly attacking him with the help of the [[Rashemen]] [[berserker]] [[Fyodor]].<ref name="DotD.K-loc5360>{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|5360}} Together, the two were able to kill the much larger Pharx,<ref name="DotD.K-loc5384>{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|5384}} but Zz'Pzora died shortly after from the injuries she had sustained.<ref name="DotD.K-loc5392>{{Cite digital book/Daughter of the Drow/Kindle|5392}}
