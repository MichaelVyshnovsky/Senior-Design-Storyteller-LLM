        "mainbody": "'''Orbel Mhaerouzan''' was a [[wizard]] who lived in [[Saerloon]], [[Sembia]], ''circa'' [[1360 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Orbel was very standoffish and blunt. He kept his ideas to himself and his activities as secret as possible.",
        "Relationships": "Mhaerouzan was a business partner with [[Endreth Molipher]], a former [[pirate]], and two other wizards, [[Halartan Groune]], and [[Gorstal Hammers]].",
        "Activities": "Orbel was a shrewd investor and he agreed to deliver subdued monsters to the island of [[Storna]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] for a share of the profits in Molipher's [[Dark Dragon Hunt]] business. The creatures were raised to be hunted by adventure-seeking clients or sold to discreet [[alchemist]]s and wizards that needed monsters or monster parts for their research. Mhaerouzan was also on staff at Molipher's [[Haunted Lake Lodge]] when needed to manipulate the dreams of unsuspecting (or uncaring) clients so the wealthy \"adventurers\" would believe they actually vanquished a deadly creature.{{Cite dragon/282/The New Adventures of Volo: The Urge to Hunt|72}}",
        "Possessions": "As part of the agreement, Orbel was allowed to use the island as a hideout or a place to store items he didn't want easily found."
