        "mainbody": "Orbel Mhaerouzan was a wizard who lived in Saerloon, Sembia, circa 1360 DR.\nOrbel was very standoffish and blunt. He kept his ideas to himself and his activities as secret as possible.\nMhaerouzan was a business partner with Endreth Molipher, a former pirate, and two other wizards, Halartan Groune, and Gorstal Hammers.\nOrbel was a shrewd investor and he agreed to deliver subdued monsters to the island of Storna in the Sea of Fallen Stars for a share of the profits in Moliphers Dark Dragon Hunt business. The creatures were raised to be hunted by adventure-seeking clients or sold to discreet alchemists and wizards that needed monsters or monster parts for their research. Mhaerouzan was also on staff at Moliphers Haunted Lake Lodge when needed to manipulate the dreams of unsuspecting (or uncaring) clients so the wealthy \"adventurers\" would believe they actually vanquished a deadly creature.\nAs part of the agreement, Orbel was allowed to use the island as a hideout or a place to store items he didnt want easily found."
