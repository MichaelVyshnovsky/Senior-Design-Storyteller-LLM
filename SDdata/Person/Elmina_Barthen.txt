'''Elmina Barthen''' was the proprietor of [[Barthen's Provisions]], the largest trading post in [[Phandalin]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note" name="gender">Elmina Barthen was originally '''Elmar Barthen''', a thin and balding middle-aged human man introduced in ''[[Lost Mine of Phandelver]]'' and involved in several other adventures, however the character was retconned to be a young human woman in ''[[Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk]]''. The reason for this is unknown.

==Personality==
Barthen had a kindly manner.

==Relationships==
Barthen employed two local lads, [[Ander (Phandalin)|Ander]] and [[Thistle (clerk)|Thistle]],

Barthen had a good business relationship with Phandalin's Townmaster, [[Harbin Wester]], and helped Harbin and his half-brother, [[Tibor Wester]], to circumvent [[Neverwinter]] taxes by transporting supplies to the latter's [[Tibor Wester's loggers' camp|logging business]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} Barthen and other townsfolk of Phandalin were constantly harassed by the [[Redbrands]], which made local trade more difficult. She was willing to share information with anybody who wished to sort the Redbrands out.

During this time, a [[dwarf]] explorer and friend of Barthen named [[Gundren Rockseeker]] believed he had located the [[Wave Echo Cave]]. Elmina was excited by the potential discovery, and agreed to help supply Gundren and his brothers, [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]. Gundren had hired a new group of [[adventurer]]s to bring a wagon full of equipment from Neverwinter to Barthen's Provisions, for which Barthen would agree to handover 10 [[gp]] each. Gundren let Barthen know that he would meet her at the store before the adventurers, however Gundren never arrived and his brothers both failed to show up to receive their resupplies. This led Barthen to worry.

By [[1496 DR]], Barthen had closed Barthen's Provisions and moved on from Phandalin.{{AI-time}}
