Marim Tem () was a half-elf entertainer and musician in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
His growing fame had a bad effect on Marim. He became pompous and arrogant and prone to throwing a tantrum if he didnt get his way. However, he was very competent, knowing nearly every song from every culture across Faer√ªn.
Marim was an entertainer and musician in Mulmaster, together with his band. In 1491 DR, the Blades of the city competed with each other over the arts, and Marim became a top pawn in their proxy war, gaining great fame. One day, he was invited to play at a party hosted by Zor Faltyn Gos.
