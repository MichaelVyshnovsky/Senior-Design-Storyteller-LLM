'''Zephan''' was a male [[Tethyrian]] [[human]] [[evoker]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].

==History==
Zephan, [[Dava]], and [[Mendios]] were apprentices to an evoker from [[Marsember]].

In the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], their master sent the three apprentices to the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] to make an offering to the goddess of [[magic]]. They also partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystra's Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside nine others: [[Durgen Glintstone]], [[Halish]], [[Kareem Hastith]], [[Smote]], [[Tholwick Styles]], [[Veera Wavecrest]], [[Duncan]], [[Kenniwick]], and [[Amnic Basult]].

In the end, Starweaver [[Deinyn Fembrys]] [[Dominate person|''dominated'']] all of them with the ''[[Starry Gnosis]]'', abducting them as part of a secret [[Shar]]ran plot. They were then put on [[Mhair]]'s boat across the [[Wyvernflow]], before journeying overland to the [[Vast Swamp]] and the [[Lost Refuge]] within.

==Abilities==
A minor mage, Zephan knew the spells ''[[burning hands]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]'', as well as some [[cantrip]]s.

==Equipment==
Wearing purple robes and armed with a simple [[dagger]], Zephan possessed a [[scroll]] of ''[[scorching ray]]'', [[potion]]s of ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', and ''[[mage armor]]'', and three flasks of [[alchemist's fire]].
