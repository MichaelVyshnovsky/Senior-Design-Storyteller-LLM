Neifion,the Lord of Bats, was an archfey of the Feywild.
Neifion was known to enter into fey pacts with warlocks.
Neifion appeared as a thin, bald, and pale human male with narrow squinting eyes and pointed ears. In this form, he wore drab black clothes.
Neifion walked on Toril during the Days of Thunder. He was among the archfey venerated by primitive humans.
Information about the Lord of Bats and his pacts could be discovered in dusty old tomes on the shelves of Candlekeep circa 1390 DR.
He entered into a fey pact with the warlock Japheth Donard, who stole the pact stone and imprisoned Neifion in Darroch Castle in the Feywild. In order to escape, Neifion sought the aid of Behroun Marhana and Malyanna.
Neifion could summon and control bats and conjure restraining vines.
He had in his possession a trek bell.
