==Description==
Neifion appeared as a thin, bald, and pale [[human]] male with narrow squinting eyes and pointed ears. In this form, he wore drab black clothes.

==History==
Neifion walked on [[Toril]] during the [[Days of Thunder]]. He was among the archfey venerated by primitive humans.

Information about the Lord of Bats and his pacts could be discovered in dusty old tomes on the shelves of [[Candlekeep]] ''circa'' [[1390 DR]].
