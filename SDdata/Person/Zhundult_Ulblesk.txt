'''Zhundult "Stormhand" Ulblesk ''' was a male [[human]] wizard who made his home in [[Tantras]] in [[1358 DR]]. He was one of the more notable mages of the city at the time.

He was a dangerous and quite possibly insane mage who aggressively defended his privacy. He was, however, a well-known researcher on [[planes|planar]] powers and [[planar traits|conditions]] and how to use them for destructive [[spell]]s. As such, he wielded an array of strange and lethal blasting spells.
