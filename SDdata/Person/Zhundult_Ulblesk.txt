Zhundult "Stormhand" Ulblesk  was a male human wizard who made his home in Tantras in 1358 DR. He was one of the more notable mages of the city at the time.
He was a dangerous and quite possibly insane mage who aggressively defended his privacy. He was, however, a well-known researcher on planar powers and conditions and how to use them for destructive spells. As such, he wielded an array of strange and lethal blasting spells.
