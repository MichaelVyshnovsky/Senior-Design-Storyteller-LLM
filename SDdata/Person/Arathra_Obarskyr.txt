'''Arathra "the Little Spider"''' was the 45{{th}} [[Obarskyr]] monarch of the royal line and a queen of [[Cormyr]]. She was one of the grandnieces of [[Gorauna Obarskyr|Gorauna]].This suggests she is the granddaughter of either [[Berost Obarskyr|Berost]], [[Gorann Obarskyr|Gorann]], or [[Ulbaeram Obarskyr|Ulbaeram]]; and daughter of [[Silbran Obarskyr|Silbran]], [[Raerboth Obarskyr|Raerboth]], [[Belmuth Obarskyr|Belmuth]], or [[Ortolar Obarskyr|Ortolar]].

Arathra's nickname came from her inherited small, frail build and her venomous disposition. She was softly smiling cruelty personified and intrigues and treachery were her fascination, delight, and entertainment. In the years before ascending the throne, she took a consort and bore him three sons, two of whom, in the fullness of time, wore the crown.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Cormyrian Kings}}
