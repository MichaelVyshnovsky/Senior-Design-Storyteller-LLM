        "Activities": "Jasha Istor lived in and operated the [[Icedawn's House]], a cabin shrine to the goddess of winter Auril situated on the [[Cloud Peaks]] mountains close to the town of [[Nashkel]]. She would greet every traveler that came through the area, seeking donations that she would scatter in the snow to ward off the wrath of Auril. People who stole more than one of these scattered coins in the summer were known to often die from [[frostbite (condition)|frostbite]] the following winter.\n\nShe was also an expert of navigating the Cloud Peaks, considered by some to be one of the best navigating them, and offered to guide travelers through them for a steep fee."
