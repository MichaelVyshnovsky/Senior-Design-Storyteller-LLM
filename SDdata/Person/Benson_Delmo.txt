Benson Delmo was the mayor of Maldobar in 1340 DR.
Delmo was "obese" and cheerful.
In 1340 DR, Mayor Benson Delmo and several other residents of Maldobar arrived at the Thistledown house, where Bartholomew Thistledowns children told them of their encounter with the drow Drizzt DoUrden. The local hunter, Roddy McGristle, cast skepticism over Connor Thistledowns claim and insisted on leading a search party to verify it. Despite calls to summon a ranger, Delmo put off the request, believing it to be too premature. Sure enough, McGristle encountered the drow and was scarred in the attempt, giving Delmo no other option but to send a missive to Sundabar.
A few days later, the Thistledown family of Maldobar was found murdered. It was believed that Drizzt had done the deed (when in fact Ulgulu had done it). Though McGristle desired to go after Drizzt immediately, Delmo was concerned that the drows presence was the sign of a larger war band, and negotiated a reward of 2,000 gold pieces for the head of the drow. He also convinced McGristle to wait for Dove Falconhands party to arrive from Sundabar before initiating pursuit.
