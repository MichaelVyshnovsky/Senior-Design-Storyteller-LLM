'''Corlan Graves''' was a well-to-do man who lived in [[Helm's Hold]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter}}

==Relationships==
He had a brother named [[Aldwin Graves|Aldwin]], who served on the council of Helm's Hold.

==History==
Corlan lived in Helm's Hold when it was overrun by the [[Ashmadai]] and [[devil]] allies in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. He tried to warn his brother about leaving the fortress-town for safety, but Aldwin would not listen. After escaping the hold himself, Corlan enlisted the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to check on Aldwin and ensure his safety.
