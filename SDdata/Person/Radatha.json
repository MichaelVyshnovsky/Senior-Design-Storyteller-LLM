After the cell refuged in [[Westgate]] was destroyed by [[Alias]]'s party, in 1357 Radatha agreed to join a [[New Alliance]] with [[Tyranthraxus]], the [[Zhentarim]], priests of [[Moander]] and one [[Red Wizards of Thay]] in order to imbue in an adventurer the [[Azure Bonds]]. Radatha's goal was kill the King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]. Meantime his minions managed to capture the runaway princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]] in order to lure Azoun IV in Tilverton. At last however Radatha's plan backfired and he was killed by Alusair."
