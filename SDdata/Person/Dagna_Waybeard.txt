'''Dagna Waybeard''' was the [[dwarven]] general and the lead military commander of [[Mithral Hall]]'s armed forces.

==Description==
The general was broad shouldered and huge by dwarf standards. He would tuck his long brown beard into his expansive belts.

==History==
He was born in [[Citadel Adbar]].

In [[1356 DR]], Dagna helped [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] reclaim Mithral Hall from the [[duergar]] of [[Clan Bukbukken]]. The general and two thousand Adbar dwarves decided to stay in the fortress of [[Clan Battlehammer]].

Dagna was killed during a battle with [[troll]]s in [[1370 DR]], when he tried to protect refugees from destroyed [[Nesme]].

==Relatives==
Dagna had only one son, [[Dagnabbit]], who was killed by [[orc]]s at [[Shallows]] in [[1370 DR]].
