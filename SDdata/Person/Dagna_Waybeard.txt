Dagna Waybeard was the dwarven general and the lead military commander of Mithral Halls armed forces.
The general was broad shouldered and huge by dwarf standards. He would tuck his long brown beard into his expansive belts.
He was born in Citadel Adbar.
In 1356 DR, Dagna helped Bruenor Battlehammer reclaim Mithral Hall from the duergar of Clan Bukbukken. The general and two thousand Adbar dwarves decided to stay in the fortress of Clan Battlehammer.
Dagna was killed during a battle with trolls in 1370 DR, when he tried to protect refugees from destroyed Nesme.
Dagna had only one son, Dagnabbit, who was killed by orcs at Shallows in 1370 DR.
