'''Highcliff''' was an apprentice blacksmith who worked in [[Moonhaven]], under the tutelage of [[Sampson]], sometime during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

The apprentice had a poor opinion of their master smith Sampson, believing him to be an overweight old fool.

==History==
At some point in his career, Highcliff developed techniques for crafting masterwork weapons, using bark from [[sussur]] trees found in the [[Underdark]]. They even penned blueprints for a specific masterwork [[dagger]], [[sickle]], and [[greatsword]]. Unfortunately, that was the only ingredient the young smith had yet to acquire.
