The apprentice had a poor opinion of their master smith Sampson, believing him to be an overweight old fool.
At some point in his career, Highcliff developed techniques for crafting masterwork weapons, using bark from sussur trees found in the Underdark. They even penned blueprints for a specific masterwork dagger, sickle, and greatsword. Unfortunately, that was the only ingredient the young smith had yet to acquire.
