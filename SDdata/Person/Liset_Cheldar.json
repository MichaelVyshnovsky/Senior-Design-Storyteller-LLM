        "Relationships": "Liset claimed to be a descendant of [[Ophala Cheldarstorn]].",
        "Description": "As of [[1479 DR]], Liset was a middle-aged woman.",
        "Personality": "Liset tried to really care for her guests. She was friendly and liked to flirt with men who caught her fancy.",
        "Activities": "Liset was one of the few survivors of the [[Ruining|eruption]] of [[Mount Hotenow]]. She fled the city after the destruction of Neverwinter.\n\nSome time before 1479 DR, Liset approached Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], and convinced him to allow her to reclaim her inheritance, the [[Moonstone Mask]] inn in the [[Protector's Enclave]]. She also convinced him to sponsor the re-opening of the inn.\n\nAs of 1479 DR, she was pretty popular among the [[Mintarn]] [[mercenary|mercenaries]] hired by Lord Neverember.",
        "Rumors": "Some believed Liset had seduced Neverember to convince him to help her reclaim and re-open the Mask.\n\nSome also believed Liset was working for sinister forces, either on her own free will or that she was being forced to do so, and that her friendly face was just a facade. However, the people who believed those rumors were unsure about the identity of the force behind Liset: some pointed to the [[Thay]]ans or the [[Netherese]], while others believed she was a thrall of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]."
