        "mainbody": "iset Cheldar was an innkeeper in Neverwinter.\nLiset claimed to be a descendant of Ophala Cheldarstorn.\nAs of 1479 DR, Liset was a middle-aged woman.\nLiset tried to really care for her guests. She was friendly and liked to flirt with men who caught her fancy.\nLiset was one of the few survivors of the eruption of Mount Hotenow. She fled the city after the destruction of Neverwinter.\nSome time before 1479 DR, Liset approached Lord Dagult Neverember, and convinced him to allow her to reclaim her inheritance, the Moonstone Mask inn in the Protectors Enclave. She also convinced him to sponsor the re-opening of the inn.\nAs of 1479 DR, she was pretty popular among the Mintarn mercenaries hired by Lord Neverember.\nSome believed Liset had seduced Neverember to convince him to help her reclaim and re-open the Mask.\nSome also believed Liset was working for sinister forces, either on her own free will or that she was being forced to do so, and that her friendly face was just a facade. However, the people who believed those rumors were unsure about the identity of the force behind Liset some pointed to the Thayans or the Netherese, while others believed she was a thrall of the Abolethic Sovereignty."
