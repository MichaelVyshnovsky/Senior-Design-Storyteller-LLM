Ogandi Tsipiang was Prince of Khazari during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Ogandi was the Prince and ruler of Khazari and lived within the city of Skarou.
The Prince was forced to offer terms of peace to the invading Yamun Khahan after he successfully captured the city of Alashan. Ogandi later attempted to reorganize the power structure of Khazari with hopes of consolidating power to better combat future invasions.
