'''Ama''' was a nun of the [[Lords of Creation]] of the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Quite aged, her face was wrinkled and her smile toothless. She wore several [[gold]] bracelets.

==Activities==
Ama performed [[divination]]s with the gizzards of beasts and [[incense|joss sticks]]. She claimed to know the future and much of what went on in the present moment across Malatra. ''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Ama even advised the chief diviner to the high priest of the kingdom,

==History==
At that time, Ama provided an overview of the peoples and nations of Malatra to a visitor from another land, but her account was colored by her prejudices. She thought those outside the Kuong Kingdom to be "barbarians" of "so-called kingdoms". She was also suspicious of the [[Mahatsureya]] temple's practices. Moreover, she even thought the [[Path of Enlightenment]] was a false religion. She did concede that the people of [[Buyan]] were "adequate" pearl-divers, "for [[Seng]]".
