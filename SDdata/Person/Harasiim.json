        "mainbody": "Harasiim was a mage from Turmish who lived in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He held the seat of abjuration in the Ministry of Art, which managed affairs of magic in the City of Ravens.\nHarasiim immigrated from Turmish to Ravens Bluff, taking his whole household with him. He became a prominent and distinguished mage in his new home.\nHe joined the newly established Ministry of Art.\nHe was charismatic.\nFollowing the Turmish custom of group marriage, Harasiim had three wives.\nHandsome, middle-aged, and a little overweight, he had dark skin with a mustache and a beard cut square after the Turmish custom. Similarly, he had three blue dots on his forehead that indicated his learning in reading, religion, and magic and a blue-stone earring in his left ear to show he was married. For these, the folk of Ravens Bluff gave him the nickname Harasiim the Blue, though he never used it himself.\nWhile Harasiim conducted his magical studies, his wives ran a number of prosperous business, both in Ravens Bluff and beyond.\nThey lived on Hippocampus Street in the Tlasbras neighborhood of the Southside District. Known as the \"Blue Castle\", the house was massive and looked like a mock castle, including battlements, tapering turrets, extra-large banners, and a number of portcullises, which would slam shut one after the other each dusk."
