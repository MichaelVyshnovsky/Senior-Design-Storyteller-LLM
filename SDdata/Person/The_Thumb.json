        "mainbody": "he Thumb was a tavern owner in Athkatla, Amn.\nThe man owned the Seas Bounty, a tavern and inn close to the citys docks. He spoke like a commoner, and often used slang. The Thumb enjoyed a drink or two he sold mead and ale. He claimed he was never a pirate, but sailed the exotic merchant routes to the west.\nThe Thumb often referred to his hook, which was his namesake, as a \"present\" from his seafaring days. However, a woman named Gracie said that one should not believe what he says. In fact, she claimed he was only a fisherman who got his hand chopped of in a tavern brawl. She also said that he won the bar in a bet.\nAfter he met the \"wee beastie\" mounted over his bed, he retired. Interestingly, a secret door in his tavern led to a pirate hideout. The captain proclaimed that he paid The Thumb good money for his secrecy.\nHe seemed friendly, offering travelers hospitality and bedding on cold and dreary days. However, if patrons got extremely drunk, hed chuck them in a bed upstairs, for an extra charge."
