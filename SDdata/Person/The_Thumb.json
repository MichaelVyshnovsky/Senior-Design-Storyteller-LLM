        "Description": "The man owned the [[Sea's Bounty]], a tavern and inn close to the city's docks. He spoke like a commoner, and often used slang. The Thumb enjoyed a drink or two; he sold [[mead]] and [[ale]]. He claimed he was never a pirate, but sailed the exotic merchant routes to the west.\n\nThe Thumb often referred to his hook, which was his namesake, as a \"present\" from his seafaring days. However, a woman named [[Gracie]] said that one should not believe what he says. In fact, she claimed he was only a fisherman who got his hand chopped of in a tavern brawl. She also said that he won the bar in a bet.\n\nAfter he met the \"wee beastie\" mounted over his bed, he retired. Interestingly, a secret door in his tavern led to a pirate hideout. The captain proclaimed that he paid The Thumb good money for his secrecy.\n\n{{fq\n|text= It be more proper to be callin' me \"the\" Thumb. Thumb alone just don't be soundin' right. Named after the hook here, naturally...\n|source=The Thumb\n}}",
        "Personality": "He seemed friendly, offering travelers hospitality and bedding on cold and dreary days. However, if patrons got extremely drunk, he'd chuck them in a bed upstairs, for an extra charge."
