'''Count Fisfnilt''' was a noble from [[Toril]], who lived some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Count Fisfnilt's name went down in history in association with a ''[[ring of human influence]].'' Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Count Fisfnilt was attempting to find a "suitable" bride for his son [[Ewnin]], who rejected countless women from across [[Faerûn]] for not meeting his standards. After Count grew exhausted with his progeny, he ordered a court [[wizard]] to create a ''ring of human influence''. The [[ring]] was gifted to a certain woman of great influence in a large nation. Ewnin fell in love with the woman, and they wed three weeks later.
