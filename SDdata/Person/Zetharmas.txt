'''Zetharmas''' was a [[tiefling]] [[warlock]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] in [[1374 DR]]. 

==History==
Zetharmas was rumored to be the scion of a powerful [[demon lord]], but nobody knew if this was true. He was one of the main leaders of the [[Church of Cyric]] faction involved in the [[Despayr]]'s plot in 1374 DR. Zetharmas was the one that materially opened the hole in the [[Weave]]. He and his fellow Cyricists resided in the [[Monastery of Ebon Dome]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]] for the duration of the plot. However, an adventurers party defeated him.
