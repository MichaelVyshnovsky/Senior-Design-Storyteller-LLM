Hatemaster Ansgar Theoderich was a priest of Iyachtu Xvim that carried on the Godsons faith in the city of Phlan during the late 15 century DR.
Haemaster Ansgar was a priest at the Lyceum of the Black Lord in Phlan, the temple whose clergy venerated Iyachtu Xvim in what was seen as dissident by the greater church of Bane. Ansgar preached that Bane truly died during the Time of Troubles in the midâ€“14 century and that Xvim took on his divine fathers form and name in order to garner greater power and more worshipers.
At some point Ansgar was abducted to the Lyceum of the Black Hand and was tortured by devotees of Bane to divulge these perceived heretical beliefs.
