'''Iphegor Nath''' was the [[High Flamelord]] of the [[Church of Kossuth|church]] of [[Kossuth]], who resided in the [[Flaming Brazier (Eltabbar)|Flaming Brazier]] in [[Eltabbar]].

==Description==
Iphegor was tall, man with a burly build. His eyes burned with an orange, fiery light. At times, small flames would dance upon his silhouette, without harming his robes or skin.

Iphegor had a presence of sardonic composure that accompanied him, which was readily noticeable by others.

==History==
In [[1375 DR]] Ihphegor led the [[Burning Braziers]], alongside other [[Thay]]an forces, in the routing of [[undead]] hordes that rampaged throughout the nation's eastern [[tharch]]s. Following their first major victory in [[Kythorn]] of that year, they were celebrated as heroes along with the [[zulkir]] of [[necromancy]] [[Szass Tam]].
