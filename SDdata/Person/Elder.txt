The Elder was a respected priest of the Faceless God and the governor of the Enlightened Ring province in the World Pillar Mountains in 1367 DR.
As with the other members of the Seven Sages, the Elder was an appointed governor of one of the provinces of the Yikarian Empire. He kept most of his slaves, who were predominantly dwarves, deep underground mining for riches. Many never saw the light of day.
Many yikarians believed the Elder was the first son of the Faceless God.
