It set them loose in Waterdeep, either in search for random targets to control or, occasionally, after specific targets such as members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] or [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]]. Individuals dominated by the intellect devourers then proceeded to act as spies for Nihiloor or, in specific cases, to capture and bring slaves or hostages to [[Skullport]]."
