'''Dynarth Bloodcowl''' was the most lethal [[Church of Garagos|Garagathan]] [[assassin]] of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Although nearly totally lacking in stealth and discretion, Dynarth remained one of the top assassins of [[Westgate]]. He was not necessarily hired to kill a dangerous enemy, but rather to send a brutal message to the victim's associates.
