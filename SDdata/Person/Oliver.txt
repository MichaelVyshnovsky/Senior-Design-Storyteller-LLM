'''Oliver''' was an [[osquip]] in [[Marigold's Menagerie]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Oliver typically hid under parchment and woodchips whenever visitors came to the Menagerie, leaving some to think of him as a rather boring exhibit. However, [[Marigold Mufflefoot]] always managed to entice him out of his hiding spot by offering small [[gemstone]]s.
