'''Helder Mornstone''' was the commander of [[Xantharl's Keep]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Helder was the leader of the garrison of Xantharl's Keep. He disliked troublemakers but appreciated adventurers in times of need. His goal in 1370 was to unveil [[Zhentarim]] and [[Cult of the Dragon]] spies inside Xantharl.

==Personality==
Helder dreamed of the day when Xantharl would be an oasis of peace dedicated to [[Mielikki]], but knew he was too old to see his dream become reality. He accepted his duty to defend the keep until his death.
