Domo was a wizard living near Phlan in 1340 DR.
In order to recover a magic bottle that he believed was in the possession of a hobgoblin tribe, he polymorphed into the form of a boy and asked the help of an adventuring party to defeat the hobgoblins, telling them a tragic story about the death of his parents at the hands of the monsters.
