'''Samdanthra''' was a cook and servant who worked in the [[Castle Obarskyr]] of [[Suzail]] ''circa'' [[1348 DR]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, Samdanthra served meals to the Court Magician [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], often in the Unicorn Chamber of the castle. The food was served despite Vangerdahast often forgetting to eat and neglecting his nutrition while working on the security of the crown. [[Laspeera Inthr√©]], the Warden of [[Cormyr]]'s [[War Wizards]] and Vangerdahast's assistant, occasionally had to threaten him to eat Samdanthra's dishes, even if Laspeera herself had to stand over the Royal Magician with a [[bullwhip]].
