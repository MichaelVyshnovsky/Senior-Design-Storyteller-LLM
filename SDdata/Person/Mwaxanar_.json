        "mainbody": "Mwaxanaré () was the princess of the fallen kingdom of Omu in Chult. Along with her brother Na, she came to live with the aarakocra in the cliffside sanctuary Kir Sabal during the late 15 century DR.\nLike one of her ancestors, Mwaxanaré was vain and rather headstrong. Her upbringing left her with an entitled disposition and ill-informed worldview. She believed all the vassals of the Sword Coast and Chult were servants to her royal decree.\nDespite her self-serving nature, the princess was quite lonely. The only other human she knew was her brother, who was still a young boy as of their residence in Kir Sabal.\nMwaxanaré was the daughter of Razaan and Omek, as well as the sister of Prince Na. She was a descendant of Napaka, the last queen of Omu, and Zalkoré, the former queen who was transformed into a medusa.\nThe aged leader of Kir Sabal, Asharra, served as the princess teacher.\nAfter their parents died, Mwaxanaré and Na were taken in by the aarakocra of Kir Sabal. While they treated her well, the aarakocra cared for the young royals in the hopes of garnering favor with the restored kingdom of Omu.\nAgainst Asharras direction, Mwaxanaré formed a pact with the Wind Dukes of Aaqa to gain magical abilities."
