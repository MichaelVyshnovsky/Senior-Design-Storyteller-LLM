He sought to manipulate the [[adventurer]]s investigating the cult's activities, by sabotaging their allies in the [[Red Wizards]] led by [[Rath Modar]]. Volmer was well aware that [[Thay]]'s ruler [[Szass Tam]] would offer a boon for anyone that stood in the way of the [[Thayan Resurrection]] movement."
