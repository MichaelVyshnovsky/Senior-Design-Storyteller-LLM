        "mainbody": "he Spirit of the Sun was a spirit of Wa associated with the sun. He was one of the Eight Million Gods.\nIn Wa Year 1663 (1245 DR), the Spirit of the Sun gave Matasuuri Shogoro, the shogun of Wa, three treasures in recognition of his work to unite Wa. These were a sword, a mirror, and a pearl, all glowing with the suns light.\nHowever, when Matasuuri Nagahide became shogun in Wa Year 1754 (1336 DR), he got the idea that the gifts were unlucky, and gave them away the sword to the Shining Temple of Bishamon, the mirror to the businessman Oshichiro Yoto of Iiso, and the pearl to Yorifusa Ti, daimyo of Hotomori. Then, in Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR), the Spirit of the Sun visited Nagahide in his dreams, learned he no longer had the treasures, and was offended. The shoguns tairo hired adventurers to retrieve the treasures."
