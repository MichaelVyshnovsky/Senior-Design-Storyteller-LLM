        "History": "In [[1245 DR|Wa Year 1663 (1245 DR)]], the Spirit of the Sun gave [[Matasuuri Shogoro]], the [[shogun]] of Wa, three treasures in recognition of his work to unite Wa. These were a sword, a mirror, and a [[pearl]], all glowing with the sun's light.\n\nHowever, when [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] became shogun in [[1336 DR|Wa Year 1754 (1336 DR)]], he got the idea that the gifts were unlucky, and gave them away: the sword to the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]], the mirror to the businessman [[Oshichiro Yoto]] of [[Iiso]], and the pearl to [[Yorifusa Ti]], [[daimyo]] of [[Hotomori]]. Then, in [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]], the Spirit of the Sun visited Nagahide in his dreams, learned he no longer had the treasures, and was offended. The shogun's tairo hired adventurers to retrieve the treasures."
