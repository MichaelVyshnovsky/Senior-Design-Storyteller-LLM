'''Nalian Fisher''' was one of Maestro [[Taegan Nightwind]]'s fencing students in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}. As of [[Alturiak 8]], he was tardy with his fencing fees, but the Maestro preferred to wait for him to pay rather than squeeze him, lest the lout leave and take his sycophants with him.{{cite book/The Rage||5}}
