'''Fearghus''' was an animal trainer and entertainer from the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Fearghus had light skin and dark brown hair. He was a timid man who spoke with stutter.

==Abilities==
Fearghus trained exotic beasts displayed by the circus to Athkathlans. Some of the creatures he was in charge were: a [[moose]], a [[squirrel]], a [[leopard]], and a dangerous-looking huge [[snake]].

==History==
Fearghus's circus could be found at the center of Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]], in [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. That year, the circus' tent fell victim to a mad [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] [[Kalah]], who transformed the tent's interior into a fanciful tower filled with guests and performers, ensorcelled to appear as monsters. When the illusion was broken and the gnome defeated, Fearghus rushed back to the tent to check up on his friends and co-workers.
