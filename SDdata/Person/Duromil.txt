'''Duromil the Fearless''' ({{Pronounce|Durr|OH|mil|refs=}}) was a [[rogue]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Duromil was very good at hiding his true nature as thief and no one in the city suspected him, a sign of his great ability.

==Activities==
Duromil posed as an average fighter who frequented the inns and taverns of the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep]] but in truth he was a very capable thief who waited for the right occasion to steal precious items. Occasionally, he really worked for [[Blazidon One-Eye]] if times were lean. Sometimes, Duromil accompanied adventuring parties as a fighter-for-hire and secretly stole from them. However, he was always very cautious, declining to act if there was even the slightest chance of failure.
