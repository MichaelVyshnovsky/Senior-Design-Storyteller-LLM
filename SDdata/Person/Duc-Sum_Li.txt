'''Duc-Sum Li''' was a [[Shou]] [[Purple Dragon knight|knight]] and healer who was the Regent of the [[Xiousing]] District in [[Marsember]]. He was a descendent of [[Li Dynasty|Emperor Li]] of the Shou [[Dynasty of Might]]. He was still active in his extreme old age in [[1479 DR]], exercising and meditating daily.[[Dan Anderson]]. "Backdrop: Xiousing." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #195. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, October 2011.

==Description==
In his old age, Duc-Sum had a long white mustache and beard that hung down to his waist.

==Abilities==
Duc-Sum was a skilled enough fighter to open his own dojo in Xiousing. He also had skills as a healer, which may have been due to his knowledge of traditional Shou medicine rather than [[divine magic]].

==Relationships==
Duc-Sum had one son, [[Chang Li]].

==Possessions==
Duc-Sum owned a [[Golden Blade]], one of only nine crafted during the Dynasty of Might.

==History==
In [[1419 DR]], Duc-Sum was traveling through [[Cormyr]] with his son when he was summoned to heal young Prince [[Foril I]] who had fallen gravely ill. King [[Azoun V]] was so grateful that he knighted Duc-Sum and granted him control over a new piece of land in Marsember that had been exposed by the drop in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]' water level. The land was settled by Shou immigrants and became known as Xiousing.

Duc-Sum went on to found the [[Lightning Dragon Dojo]] where he taught until he was too old to spar. He was known as a wise and fair ruler of his regency.
