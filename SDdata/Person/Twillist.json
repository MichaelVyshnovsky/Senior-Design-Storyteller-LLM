        "mainbody": "Twillist was a rogue mage of Myth Drannor.\nTwillists spellcraft was good enough that he could comprehend the \"ends\" of spells quite well. Such \"ends\" were distinct sections of casting described on separate pages, often scattered and impossible to find easily save by the authors own familiarity. The practice was common among elf mages at the time.\nTwillist liked to collect such \"ends\" and then trade them for complete spells\nIn the midâ€“8 century DR, Elminster briefly remembered the rogue mage Twillist of Myth Drannor when he discovered a number of \"ends\" of spells at Moonshorn Tower."
