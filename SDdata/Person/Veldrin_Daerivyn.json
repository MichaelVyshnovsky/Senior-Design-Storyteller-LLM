        "mainbody": "'''Veldrin Daerivyn''' \"Bluehands\" was the [[Magister]] between {{yearlink|762}} and {{yearlink|797}}.",
        "Description": "He had a high forehead and a hairline reaching the crown of his skull, but the hair on the sides of his head was long.",
        "Personality": "Personally impressive, the wizard was cold and calculating, as well as capable of amazing mimicry.",
        "History": "Before becoming the [[Magister]], Veldrin used to hunt and slay mages whom he believed could become dangerous rivals, becoming infamous for his overwhelming ambushes on them. He spied extensively on other mages, often goading them into an attack before taking what he pleased, or even locking them into beast shape. His activities mainly took him through [[Amn]], [[Tethyr]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]].\n\nVeldrin was awarded the office of the Magister for being, if not more powerful than a score of the hidden [[lich]]es and hermits out there, much more effective with his sorcery. Unfortunately, he shattered his mind with a spell that linked his mind with that of three different hidden archmages, too subtly for them to realize, but feeding him with all the spells they created. His mind could not take it, and he became afflicted with a bout of idiocy. Within a night, he had been eaten by [[wolves]].",
        "Trivia": "His nickname came from his habit of letting blue lightning arc around his wrists. His legendary treasure cache was never found."
