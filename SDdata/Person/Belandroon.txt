Belandroon was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR.
In Mirtul of the , while grumbling about how difficult it was to hunt down Elminster Aumar, Belandroon was named by the War Wizard Eskrel Starbridge alongside Hawksar and Arbrace as one of the few War Wizards who might well be as competent as they thought themselves to be. All mages present grinned at that.
