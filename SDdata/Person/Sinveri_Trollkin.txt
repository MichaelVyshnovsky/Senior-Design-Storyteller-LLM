'''Sinveri Trollkin''' was a [[half-drow|quarter-drow]] [[half-elf]] woman who served as the general of the armed forces of [[Ulgarth]] around [[1367 DR]]. She hailed originally from the land of [[Dambrath]], but had turned renegade.<ref group="note">''[[The Shining South (1993)|The Shining South]]'' says that Sinveri is an [[elf]], but also says there are no elves in Dambrath, only [[half-elves]] and [[half-drow]]. Thus, it seems more likely that this is only a description, and that Sinveri is a half-elf, mostly liked counted as a half-drow.<ref group="note">Her relationship to [[troll]]s is unknown. However, the word [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drow "drow"] is etymologically related to the word "troll", suggesting similar linguistics here.

Sinveri was a capable leader and intelligent. She was a devout follower of [[Tyr]], god of justice and warfare.
