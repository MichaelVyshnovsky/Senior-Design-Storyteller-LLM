        "History": "In early [[1370 DR]], Elene Ruldegost and [[Asborn Moonstar]] fell madly in love to the disapproval of their families. The Moonstars and Ruldegost were old enemies and forbade the union. Eventually, Ruldegost agreed to let the young couple to be wed under one condition, Asborn was to delve into [[Undermountain]] and retrieve a rare [[crystal rose]] from the [[Garden of the Drow]]. The young man descended into the dungeon right away and disappeared for over a week. When the families started getting worried over his well-being, they requested [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s aid. He sent his loyal agent to retrieve the boy. [[Khelbenite]] subsequently found the boy's lifeless body, sealed in the garden's chamber where he perished of hunger. The adventurer retrieved the crystal rose and delivered it to Elene Ruldegost along with the dire news."
