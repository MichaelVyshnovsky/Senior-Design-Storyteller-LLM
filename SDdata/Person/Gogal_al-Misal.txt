Gogal al-Misal was a nefarious slave trader within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
In reality, he was actually a skilled flame mage of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.
Gogal was lean and possessed aquiline features. He was a handsome man in his late 30s. He always kept his beard and mustache neatly trimmed. In order to put many of his customers at ease, Gogal appeared completely unarmed at all times. All of his magical items and spellcasting components were hidden beneath his voluminous robe.
Since no official slave market existed within the City of Delights, Gogal used his monopoly on the vile business to make himself rich. He operated his business out of an open courtyard within the Grand Bazaar. Most of his clientele consisted of disreputable nobles and merchants. Many of the missing persons of Huzuzs less affluent districts were a direct result of Gogals agents.
In addition to the stock he kept on display, Gogal took orders from clients requesting specific types of slaves like dwarves needed to dig a mine. Gogal also wandered the vast market in search of potential wealthy clients.
Gogal enjoyed disguising himself as a trader or slaver in order to approach his intended targets. He also served as a excellent recruiter for the Brotherhood.
In order to maintain his secrecy, Gogal never contacted the other agents of the Brotherhood within Huzuz, preferring instead to operate as an individual. With delicate care, Gogal made important contacts with Huzuzs nobility, helped raise money, and passed along useful information, all for the greater glory of the Brotherhood.
Gogal began his life with the Brotherhood by recruiting agents in Qadib. However, he did not really garner the attention of the Bonfire until assuming command of the Flamedeath Fellowship in Umara.
Gogal was rumored to own a ring of fire resistance, a scarab of deception, a wand of fire, and a aba of displacement.
