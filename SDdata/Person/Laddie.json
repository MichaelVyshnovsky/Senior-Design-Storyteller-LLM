        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Wild Pastures west of [[Liam's Hold]] hamlet began experiencing uncanny disappearances of cattle, sometimes in the middle of the day. Laddie and its master Ivrin the Shepherd witnessed one such disappearance firsthand. The shepherd's favorite cow [[Betty]] seemingly stopped existing after the observer duo heard strange giggling. [[Goblin]] tribe in service of the [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]] armed with shaman brews of ''[[invisibility]]'' were to blame."
