'''Pascal''' was slimy [[rogue]] inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He owned a boarding house called [[Pascal's Tenements]] that was widely used by Daggerford's underworld to avoid the attention from the militia. Pascal himself was believed to live outside of the city, but that was only because no one ever saw him coming or going from his building.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
