Pascal was slimy rogue inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He owned a boarding house called Pascals Tenements that was widely used by Daggerfords underworld to avoid the attention from the militia. Pascal himself was believed to live outside of the city, but that was only because no one ever saw him coming or going from his building.
