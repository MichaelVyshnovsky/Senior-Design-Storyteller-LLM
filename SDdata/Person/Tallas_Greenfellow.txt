Tallas Greenfellow was a half-elf proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Chauntea. He was one of the two primary proxies in that goddesss divine realm, the Great Mothers Garden.
Embodying the more agricultural aspect of his power, Tallas spent much of his time concerned about how good each harvest would be.
Tallas got along quite well with Leyla Wildwood, Chaunteas other primary proxy in the Great Mothers Garden.
