'''Baalbisan''' was a [[balor]] who was trapped within [[Ammon Jerro]]'s haven in the [[Sword Mountains]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] for the purpose of empowering the [[warlock]]. He was in a constant feud with several of the other imprisoned [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s, but in the {{YearlinkName|1374}} he broke free when he convinced [[Shandra Jerro]] to spill her blood to undo the magic that bound the demons to the haven. Baalbisan's matron was named [[Zaxis]].
