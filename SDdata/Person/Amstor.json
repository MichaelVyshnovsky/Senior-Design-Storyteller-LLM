        "mainbody": "'''Amstor the Grim''' was a [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Arvoreen]] that worked as a priest and administrator at [[Holyhands House]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He and his two brothers were known as the [[Defenders Three]].",
        "Description": "Amstor put on a large amount of weight after he retired from adventuring and guard duty.",
        "Personality": "In his youth, Amstor was a lighthearted fellow, but a betrayal by a lover during his adventuring days changed his outlook and he acquired the nickname \"the Grim\".",
        "Abilities": "Amstor had his own style of defensive fighting that utilized a [[staff]] or a [[rod]] to keep enemies at bay and then vault onto them, overbalancing and knocking them prone. He taught this technique to other young (usually short) clerics. He and his trainees were a popular attraction at the [[Field of Triumph]] when they demonstrated for the crowd.",
        "Activities": "He worked at the [[Plinth]] before he made the acquaintance of Lord [[Ultas Maernos]] in the late 1360s [[DR]]. Amstor was impressed by the noble's faith and the enemies he had made on behalf of the [[demihuman]]s of Waterdeep, so he persuaded his brothers to join him and seek employment with House [[Maernos]] as bodyguards. and by 1372 DR, the former Maernos villa was known as Holyhands House. Amstor and his brothers became the administrators of the temple.",
        "Relationships": "The Defenders Three were considered friends of the [[Harpers]] because, in their service to Lord Maernos, they delivered packages and messages to various Harper agents in [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Luskan]], and [[Mirabar]]. The trio hoped to be invited to become full-fledged Harpers.",
        "History": "Amstor initially worked in his family's businesses in the [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]] where they had a wine-making shop and a [[Common dictionary#W|whitesmith]] shop. He fell in love with a halfling woman and joined her adventuring group. After about a year of that life, his lover betrayed him and the rest of the group to an evil [[wizard]]. He survived and returned to the city, but was thereafter serious and dour."
