        "History": "In [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}{{LCRB}}, Leyland - Nightstalker wedding took place. Dame [[Jenilynn Leyland]], a [[Knight]] of the [[Right Hand of Tyr]], and Sir [[Sarren Nightstalker]], a [[Knight of the Griffon]], were united in a social gala that was reported on the pages of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]''. Sir Harker Sorrel was one of the attendants to the groom, alongside [[Lord Farendrell‎]] and [[Alexander Thorin]]. It was reported that the wedding was scheduled for an earlier date, but Jenilynn Leyland was delayed due to her mission to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and being transformed into a [[Unicorn]]."
