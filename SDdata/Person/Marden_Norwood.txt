Lord '''Marden Norwood''' was the patriarch of [[House Norwood]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|1546|5}}

==Description==
Norwood had silver hair.

==Relationships==
Lord Norwood was extremely protective of his daughter [[Seila Norwood|Seila]]. He initially had warm feelings toward [[Jack Ravenwild]]{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||9}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Lord Norwood's daughter, Seila was captured by the [[slave|slaver]] [[Cailek Balathorp|Fetterfist]] and sold into slavery to the [[drow]] who lived beneath Ravens Bluff. Seila was rescued by Jack Ravenwild, who returned her to Lord Norwood.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|1248|5}}

Norwood richly rewarded Jack with a 5,000 [[gold piece]] line of credit at a local counting house as well as the use of [[Maldridge House]], a mansion in Ravens Bluff. Jack passed himself off as a minor noble from the [[Vilhon Reach]], an area that had been devastated by the [[Spellplague]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||5}} However, Lord Norwood hired sages to investigate Jack's claim and found it to be impossible. After learning of Jack's deceit, Norwood ordered Jack out of the mansion and told him to keep away from Seila.

Later, a noble revel attended by Lord Norwood and his daughter was attacked by Fetterfist and his gang. Seila and other surviving nobles were carried through a [[magic]] portal to the [[Underdark]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4263|13}}   Norwood and [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] led an armed force to the drow's domain and destroyed the drow.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4960|13}} Jack jumped through the portal{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4357|12}} and rescued Seila once more from Fetterfist.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4720|13}}
