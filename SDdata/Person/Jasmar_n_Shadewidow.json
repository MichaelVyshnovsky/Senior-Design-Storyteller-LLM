        "mainbody": "'''Jasmar'n Shadewidow''' was a small-time crime lord in [[Skullport]].",
        "Personality": "Jasmar'n was cold and emotionless. She usually never departed from her shop, instead operating through underlings.",
        "Relationships": "She had a vulture familiar called [[Gakk]].",
        "History": "Once Jasmar'n was a talented apprentice chirurgeon in [[Waterdeep]] until she was discovered performing necromantic rites on bodies in the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]]. Abandoned by her master, she continued her experiments until found a ''[[gate]]'' to Skullport. Once there, Jasmar'n joined the [[Cryptkey Facilitations]] organization, trading her knowledge of secret and little-used access routes into many nearby tombs and the location of the gate for training in [[necromancy]] from the facilitators. Soon she rose to become the leader of the group."
