        "mainbody": "Jasmarn Shadewidow was a small-time crime lord in Skullport.\nJasmarn was cold and emotionless. She usually never departed from her shop, instead operating through underlings.\nShe had a vulture familiar called Gakk.\nOnce Jasmarn was a talented apprentice chirurgeon in Waterdeep until she was discovered performing necromantic rites on bodies in the City of the Dead. Abandoned by her master, she continued her experiments until found a gate to Skullport. Once there, Jasmarn joined the Cryptkey Facilitations organization, trading her knowledge of secret and little-used access routes into many nearby tombs and the location of the gate for training in necromancy from the facilitators. Soon she rose to become the leader of the group."
