        "mainbody": "Connerad Brawnanvil, son of Banak Brawnanvil, was the 12th King of Mithral Hall and leader of Clan Battlehammer around 1440 DR. Although his name was Brawnanvil, he was of Battlehammer blood and used the name in formal events.\nConnerad spent time training with Thibbledorf Pwent and the Gutbuster Brigade before ascending to the throne, making him into a seasoned and deadly warrior. During the Tyranny of Dragons, he was chosen as an ambassador of the Lords Alliance dwarves at the Council of Waterdeep.\nIn 1486 DR, he abdicated his throne and title to Dagnabbet to join the march to Gauntlgrym. He was slain by a glabrezu in the Battle of the Under Way. Later that year, he was given the honorary title of being the 1st King of Gauntlgrym."
