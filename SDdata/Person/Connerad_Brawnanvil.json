        "History": "Connerad spent time training with [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] and the [[Gutbuster Brigade]] before ascending to the throne, making him into a seasoned and deadly warrior. During the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], he was chosen as an ambassador of the [[Lords' Alliance]] dwarves at the [[Council of Waterdeep]].\n\nIn [[1486 DR]], he abdicated his throne and title to [[Dagnabbet]] to join the march to Gauntlgrym. He was slain by a [[glabrezu]] in the [[Battle of the Under Way]]. Later that year, he was given the honorary title of being the 1st King of Gauntlgrym.<ref>"
