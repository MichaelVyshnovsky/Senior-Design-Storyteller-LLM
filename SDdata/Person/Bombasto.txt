Bombasto was a barbarian patron of the Elfsong Tavern from the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Bombasto was a middle-aged human man with a tanned skin tone. He had blue eyes, a bushy braided light brown beard, and a clean-shaven head. His face and scalp were decorated with simple geometric lines and designed tattoos. He wore a simple set of barbarian clothes and a massive greataxe.
Bombasto carried a journal written in large and loose handwriting, collecting memories of Bombastos adventuring and juvenile pranks.
Bombastos traveling companion was Dame Guisarme, with whom he seemed to have a flirtatious and friendly-antagonistic relationship. She thought the barbarians schemes and ideas were crazy but ended up getting involved in them anyway, but not before receiving a compliment from Bombasto and responding to it with a slap.
In the , Bombasto was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldurs Gate. He was often seen dining or enjoying drinks with his mercenary adventuring companion, Dame Guisarme.
One of Bombastos adventures was his and Dame Guisarmes stand against hobgoblin raiders who held a wagonload of beer. Bombasto was thirsty and suggested the adventurers trade a wagonload of donkey shit for the hobgoblins beer. Despite Dame Guisarme considering the idea crazy, Bombasto went on pushing a wagon of manure off a hill. It rolled down and pushed the hobgoblins cart of beer forward, slaying in its place. Guisarme grabbed the beer wagon down in a ravine.
During their time at the Elfsong Tavern, Bombasto and Guisarme contemplated accepting a job in East Chult, guarding extractive safari out of Fort Beluarian with bonuses paid to all survivors.
