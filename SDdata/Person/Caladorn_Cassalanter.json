        "mainbody": "'''Caladorn Cassalanter''' was a young and gallant secret [[Masked Lord]] and later [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], who served during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Caladorn was a fighter through and through â€“ broad-shouldered, and {{SI|6|ft}} tall.",
        "Personality": "Caladorn was quite perceptive and intelligent. He acted with purpose, and had a cynical outlook, He was considered to be the epitome of the \"Knight Bachelor\".",
        "Activities": "As lord, was very interested in the city's navy and understood the challenges they had in maintaining order around the [[Sea of Swords]].",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "A member of the noble family of [[Cassalanter]], one of the richest families in Waterdeep,  Caladorn ceased using his family's name until he had done \"something worthy of it.\" His father, Lord [[Ohrl Cassalanter]], believed that Caladorn would never deem himself worthy, and so he was left with the benefits of his birthright but none of the responsibilities.",
            "Adventuring Years": "In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Caladorn was traveling on the ship ''[[Cutter (ship)|Cutter]]'', a [[seal]]-hunting ship captained by [[Farlow]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. While he was on the ship, the crew discovered an abandoned ship full of pickled [[sea elf|sea elves]] packed in [[barrel]]s bearing the mark of [[Ruathym]]. It was later discovered to be part of a plot to provoke the [[Lords' Alliance]] into war on Ruathym.\n\nCaladorn intended to bring the barrels back to Waterdeep to begin an investigation, but his ship was intercepted by the ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]'', which scuttled their ship and marooned the crew. With the help of [[Xzorsh]], Caladorn was eventually able to make it to safety on Ruathym and explain his story.\n\nSoon afterwards, Caladorn traveled back to Waterdeep with [[Liriel Baenre]] and [[Fyodor]], helping them to contact [[Danilo Thann]] in order to secure safe passage to the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] near [[Skullport]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Caladorn was courting [[Lucia Thione-Hhune|Lucia Thione]] and planning to marry her. However, Lucia, a high-ranking member of the [[Knights of the Shield]], discovered that he was a Lord of Waterdeep and attempted to poison him in order to keep her true allegiances secret. Heartbroken, Caladorn quit the Lords and his city for two years, traveling the [[Sword Coast]].",
            "Later Years and Death": "By the {{YearlinkName|1399}}, Caladorn had been named [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep.\n\nAfter his death, Caladorn's body was interned in the family crypt under [[Cassalanter Villa]] in Waterdeep with his plate armor and [[Mace of disruption]]. His [[ghost]] continued to dwell within the crypt, sympathetic to those bore the [[holy symbol]] of [[Siamorphe]]."
        },
        "Relationships": "Caladorn was the third son of [[Ohrl Cassalanter|Lord Ohrl]],{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|2}}\n\nCaladorn and [[Danilo Thann]] were well-acquainted. It was postulated that Caladorn ran off to join the ''Cutter'' after Danilo chased him away from pursuing his sister [[Judith Thann]]. He thought highly of the charming [[Randulaith]] who hailed from [[Mirabar]].\n\nCaladorn had a servant named [[Anthony]], who was killed by Lucia Thione in [[1364 DR]].\n\nYears after his death, Lord Caladorn was still considered to be a hero of [[the North]]."
