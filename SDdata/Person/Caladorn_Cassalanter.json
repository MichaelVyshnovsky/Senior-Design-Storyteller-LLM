        "mainbody": "Caladorn Cassalanter was a young and gallant secret Masked Lord and later Open Lord of Waterdeep, who served during the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nCaladorn was a fighter through and through â€“ broad-shouldered, and  tall.\nCaladorn was quite perceptive and intelligent. He acted with purpose, and had a cynical outlook, He was considered to be the epitome of the \"Knight Bachelor\".\nAs lord, was very interested in the citys navy and understood the challenges they had in maintaining order around the Sea of Swords.\nA member of the noble family of Cassalanter, one of the richest families in Waterdeep,  Caladorn ceased using his familys name until he had done \"something worthy of it.\" His father, Lord Ohrl Cassalanter, believed that Caladorn would never deem himself worthy, and so he was left with the benefits of his birthright but none of the responsibilities.\nIn the , Caladorn was traveling on the ship Cutter, a seal-hunting ship captained by Farlow in the Sea of Moving Ice. While he was on the ship, the crew discovered an abandoned ship full of pickled sea elves packed in barrels bearing the mark of Ruathym. It was later discovered to be part of a plot to provoke the Lords Alliance into war on Ruathym.\nCaladorn intended to bring the barrels back to Waterdeep to begin an investigation, but his ship was intercepted by the Elfmaid, which scuttled their ship and marooned the crew. With the help of Xzorsh, Caladorn was eventually able to make it to safety on Ruathym and explain his story.\nSoon afterwards, Caladorn traveled back to Waterdeep with Liriel Baenre and Fyodor, helping them to contact Danilo Thann in order to secure safe passage to the Promenade of the Dark Maiden near Skullport.\nIn the , Caladorn was courting Lucia Thione and planning to marry her. However, Lucia, a high-ranking member of the Knights of the Shield, discovered that he was a Lord of Waterdeep and attempted to poison him in order to keep her true allegiances secret. Heartbroken, Caladorn quit the Lords and his city for two years, traveling the Sword Coast.\nBy the , Caladorn had been named Open Lord of Waterdeep.\nAfter his death, Caladorns body was interned in the family crypt under Cassalanter Villa in Waterdeep with his plate armor and Mace of disruption. His ghost continued to dwell within the crypt, sympathetic to those bore the holy symbol of Siamorphe.\nCaladorn was the third son of Lord Ohrl,\nCaladorn and Danilo Thann were well-acquainted. It was postulated that Caladorn ran off to join the Cutter after Danilo chased him away from pursuing his sister Judith Thann. He thought highly of the charming Randulaith who hailed from Mirabar.\nCaladorn had a servant named Anthony, who was killed by Lucia Thione in 1364 DR.\nYears after his death, Lord Caladorn was still considered to be a hero of the North."
