        "mainbody": "'''Florentine Dempster''' was the Lady Lord of [[Turmish]] between [[150 DR|150]] and [[154 DR]], following the death of her husband, Lord [[Dempster Turmish]].",
        "History": "Florentine Dempster's rule began in the {{YearlinkName|150}} after Dempster Turmish dies in his sleep. Before his death, the Lord of Turmish was amassing a navy force to helm another strike on the city of [[Hlondeth]], following an unsuccessful invasion in the {{YearlinkName|146}}. Florentine's first decree was to call the war off, exercise diplomacy, pursuing peace with the bitter historical rival. Her reign lasted only for four years as Lady Lord Florentine Dempster was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|154}}. The rulership of Turmish fell into the hands of wealthy and influential Merchant Princes, regularly passing from one family to another. This period of 100 years that followed Dempster Turmish's death became known as [[The Calmwaters]] due to lack of any major historic events and prosperity of the [[Vilhon Reach]]."
