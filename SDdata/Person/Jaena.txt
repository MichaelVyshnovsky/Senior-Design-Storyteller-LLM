'''Jaena''' was an [[elf]] girl traveling along the [[High Road]] between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Jaena had light brown hair in a long ponytail.

==History==
Some time around {{Yearlink|1490}}, Jaena and her dog [[Guen]] joined the merchant's caravan of [[Tollin]] and his crew going from Neverwinter to Luskan, accompanied by members of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]], in order to meet up with her sister in Luskan. During the journey, the caravan was attacked by mercenaries hired by the [[Order of the Gilded Eye]].
