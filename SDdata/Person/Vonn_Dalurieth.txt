Vonn Dalurieth was a merchant and mage from Calaunt in the Vast.
He was short and graying.
He really liked his bears. In fact, he favored his bears so much that he was willing to forgive much to recover one. He liked to show off his magic.
Vonn Dalurieth could cast a spell similar to ice storm, and he could also cast a spell to serve wine from afar, akin to mage hand.
Vonn Dalurieth had two bears, which were emblems of his familys fortune. 
His daughter was Arveene Dalurieth.
One night, the avariel bladesinger Taegan Nightwind attempted to steal away his daughter, Arveene Dalurieth he desisted as he realized Arveene was not being held against her will. That same night, men working for Falar Aporos killed one of Vonns bears and stole the other. Not long after, however, Taegan Nightwind defeated Falars men his bear was returned soon after. The avariel became a guest of his.
Falar Aporos lied that Vonn was keeping his daughter against her will so that Taegan would steal her away, creating a distraction for him to steal the bear.
