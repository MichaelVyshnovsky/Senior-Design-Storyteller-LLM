Vamar Isahn was a lich living in Serôs in Vamars Tower.
Born in 1247 DR, Vamar was a wizard in Starmantle. In 1308 DR, after becoming a lich, he relocated himself and his tower to Serôs.
There, Vamar remained secluded, working on his studies of aquatic magic. In 1369 DR, his tower was attacked three times by sahuagin and morkoth during the Twelfth Serôs War but Vamar destroyed all invaders.
Vamas was a quite paranoid but not so evil individual. He only wanted to not be disturbed.
