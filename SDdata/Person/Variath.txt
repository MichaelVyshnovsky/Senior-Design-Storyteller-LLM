Variath was a powerful druid in the Chondalwood in 1358 DR.
Variath governed a section of Chondalwood.
Variath was born and raised in the Chondalwood, only venturing into the outside world once.
In 1358 DR, Variath found ten members of the Sailors of the Crimson Sea mercenary company inside his forest after they had killed a deer, a terrible crime in Variaths eyes. He captured them and put them on trial.
Variath believed that all outside the Chondalwood was evil and that men were evil. He hated what he had seen in Faer√ªn. In truth, Variath was full of petty hatred and wanted to vent his ire on someone.
