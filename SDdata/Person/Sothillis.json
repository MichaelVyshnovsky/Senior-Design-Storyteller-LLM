        "mainbody": "'''Sothillis''', or '''Sythillis''', was an [[ogre mage]] who attacked the southern cities of [[Amn]] in [[West Faer没n]] and founded the [[Sothillisian Empire]].",
        "Personality": "While he is a renowned leader, Sothillis is greatly feared for his cruel actions.",
        "Description": "With mottled green skin and jet black hair, Sythillis is a giant among even the ogre magi, standing just under 16 feet (4.8m) tall and weighing nearly two tons. His short, red horns are encircled in [[mithral]]-laced arcane runes.",
        "Equipment": "Among Sothillis' possessions are ''[[Kingscar]]'', ''[[Blue Lightning (bow)|Blue Lightning]]'', a ''[[medallion of thoughts]]'' and a ''[[ring of evasion]]''.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], a letter from the [[Iron Throne]] leader [[Rieltar Anchev]] to [[Davaeorn]] referenced the \"[[Sothillisian War|Sythillisian uprising]]\" in Amn as a reason why Amn did not act to stop the [[Iron Crisis]].\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], Sythillis along with [[Cyrvisnea]], led an army of [[goblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[hill giant]]s and worshipers of [[Cyric]] in attacks upon southern [[Amn]]. Their army numbered almost 3,000 soldiers. \n\nIn [[1372 DR]], Sythillis entered the short but bloody conflict with the kingdom of [[Tethyr]] later named the [[Bloody Fall]]. The cause of the attack remain unclear, however, many historians believed that the fires of war were stocked by corrupt leadership of the [[Crimson Guard]], a mercenary company that served Queen [[Zaranda Star]]. Another theory claimed that an agent of the [[Unseen]] - a [[malaugrym]], manipulated both sides and causing the aggression for its own nefarious needs. The conflict reportedly cost thousands of lives and came to conclusion when an unnamed hero fought through Sothillis's hordes and defeated the warlord in battle.\n\nAs of [[1374 DR]], the force still inhabited Murann. \n\nBy [[1482 DR]], Sythillis's giant sword, the''Kingscar'' was displayed in a small gallery of the [[Seatower of Balduran]], possible evidence of the ogre mage's demise.",
