        "mainbody": "'''Durren Strongshatter''' was a famous [[dwarf|dwarven]] sculptor and a philanthropist who died in the final days of the [[Weeping War]] of [[Myth Drannor]] leaving behind a legacy of uniquely-shaped peaceful [[gargoyle]]s.",
        "Personality": "Even though Durren Strongshatter was renowned for his skills, he lived a humble frugal life, using the money he made with his art to sponsor struggling dwarven communities throughout [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Abilities": "Durren possessed some combat skills that he developed much earlier in his long life, he kept his military [[pick]] as a proof.\n\nThe most noteworthy skills the old Strongshatter had was the amazing ability to recreate anyone's likeness, chiseled out of stone of any kind, carved out of wood, or ice, or shaped out of metal. The dignitaries and nobles of Myth Drannor paid him handsomely for his work. His true passion was in creating gargoyles of various shapes, from humanoid and animalistic, to monstrous and abstractly shaped. His humble [[Durren's workshop|workshop]] was littered with many such carved creatures.",
        "History": "Durren Strongshatter picked up his military pick, untouched for over hundred years, in defense of his humble workshop from the advancing [[Army of Darkness]]. In the final moments of the Weeping War, when Myth Drannor's defenses were at last overwhelmed, Durren was bested and killed in battle by a [[yugoloth]]. His death, creative spark, wild magics of the war, and the energies of the city's ''[[mythal]]'' somehow breathed live into Durren's beloved creations. The gargoyles seized the killer of their creator, dragged him to the workshop's roof. There, the yugoloth was twisted and broken into a horrifically deformed version of itself, and turned to stone.\n\nIn centuries following the destruction of Myth Drannor, Durren's gargoyles were known to return to live every few years, and fly to hunt for [[fiends]], granting them the same fate as the yugoloth who killed Strongshatter. These gargoyles could be bribed with [[gem]]stones by adventurers exploring the ruins to share information or other aid."
