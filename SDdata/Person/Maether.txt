'''Maether''' was a sage from [[Ordulin]]. They were quoted as one of the sources about the [[Magister]] [[Uldinus Lawkland]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and had at least one choice quote about him. Maether was also the one to record about Uldinus' unique affinity with [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s.
