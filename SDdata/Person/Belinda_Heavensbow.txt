Belinda Heavensbow was a former member of Silverymoons Knights in Silver in the late 15th century DR.
She was the best friend of Aleina Brightlance.
Belinda enrolled in the Knights in Silver together with Aleina. They rose through the ranks together until Belinda quit in order to help her father in their archers shop. They remained friends however.
In 1485 DR, Belinda was the first to welcome Aleina back to the city, after believing her dead at the fall of Sundabar. Aleina explained all her adventures to her friend, including her sexual relations with the reborn Wulfgar.
