'''Moonwing''' was a [[silver dragon]] and a member of the [[Talons of Justice]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In 1373 DR, [[Azhaq]] and his fellow Moonwing were sent to capture the rebellious [[song dragon]] [[Karasendrieth]], but they were defeated after [[Dorn Graybrook]]'s team helped Kara in the battle.

After the [[metallic dragon]]s changed their minds and decided to join the fight against [[Sammaster]], Moonwing along his fellow Talons were sent to attack Sammaster's citadel. After an attempt to break the magical shield of the citadel, Moonwing was killed.
