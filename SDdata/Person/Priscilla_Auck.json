        "mainbody": "Priscilla Auck was the sister of Feringal, lord of Auckney, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nPriscilla was domineering and controlling over her younger brothers actions, in part because of her desire to rule Auckney herself. She tended a beautiful garden in Castle Auck, perhaps the only fact that endeared her to Meralda Ganderlay, Feringals betrothed.\nPriscilla was the older sister of Feringal, whom she called \"Feri.\" Their father was Tristan Auck, who died when Priscilla was about 10 years old.\nShe looked down and even despised Meralda, Feringals betrothed, until she was led to believe that Meralda had been raped.\nShe and Temigast were secretly lovers."
