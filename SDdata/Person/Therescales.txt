'''Therescales''' was the best [[wizard]]-hunter in [[Luthcheq]] in [[Chessenta]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Therescales was an agent of [[Jaerios Karanok]]. He was a member of the [[Mage Society]]; he always urged them to call foreign wizards to help them against [[House Karanok]], but his true goal was to lead them into a trap.

==Personality==
Therescales really enjoyed betraying people. At heart, however, he was a coward, who would confess anything if his life was threatened.
