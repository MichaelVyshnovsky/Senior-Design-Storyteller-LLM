Therescales was the best wizard-hunter in Luthcheq in Chessenta in 1357 DR.
Therescales was an agent of Jaerios Karanok. He was a member of the Mage Society he always urged them to call foreign wizards to help them against House Karanok, but his true goal was to lead them into a trap.
Therescales really enjoyed betraying people. At heart, however, he was a coward, who would confess anything if his life was threatened.
