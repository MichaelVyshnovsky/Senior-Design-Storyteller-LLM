Lhaerand woke up when Paeregur called everyone awake only he and Phostral were still alive at that point. Paeregur asked him to hurl fire at the phantom, but after seeing it disintegrate Phostral into nothing, Lhaerand instead ran all the way to the cliffside and jumped. Paeregur heard him hit the earth, presumably killed."
