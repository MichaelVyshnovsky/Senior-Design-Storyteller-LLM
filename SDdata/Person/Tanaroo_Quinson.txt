'''Tanaroo Quinson''' was a [[gnome]] illusionist in the [[Bloodstone Lands]] around [[1357 DR]] and [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Tanaroo was the assistant of Doctor [[Trundles]] in managing the [[Circus of Doctor Trundles]], a collection of monsters.

==History==
In 1357 DR, Tanaroo went with Doctor Trundles and his circus to the [[Damara]]n city of [[Valls]]. However, a [[bulette]] freed itself and other monsters. Tanaroo hired some adventurers, including the soon-to-be-famous [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], to capture the monsters before they killed someone.

In [[1359 DR]], after capturing new monsters, Trundles went back for a new tour inÂ [[Impiltur]]. Tanaroo acted as ringmaster with Trundles staying behind the scenes.

==Relationship==
Tanaroo always traveled with Doctor Trundles.
