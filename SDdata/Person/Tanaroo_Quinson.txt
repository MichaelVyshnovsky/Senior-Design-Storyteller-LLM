Tanaroo Quinson was a gnome illusionist in the Bloodstone Lands around 1357 DR and 1359 DR.
Tanaroo was the assistant of Doctor Trundles in managing the Circus of Doctor Trundles, a collection of monsters.
In 1357 DR, Tanaroo went with Doctor Trundles and his circus to the Damaran city of Valls. However, a bulette freed itself and other monsters. Tanaroo hired some adventurers, including the soon-to-be-famous Gareth Dragonsbane, to capture the monsters before they killed someone.
In 1359 DR, after capturing new monsters, Trundles went back for a new tour inÂ Impiltur. Tanaroo acted as ringmaster with Trundles staying behind the scenes.
Tanaroo always traveled with Doctor Trundles.
