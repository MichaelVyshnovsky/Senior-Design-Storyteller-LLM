'''Mondar''' was a [[dwarf]] and resident of [[Dalekeva]].

==History==
''Circa'' {{Yearlink|-700}},{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20030621194957/http://www.wizards.com/forgottenrealms/FR_Timeline.asp#index|author=[[Eric L. Boyd]] et al.|title=Presenting . . . Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction|accessdate=2014-2-28}} a group of [[Netherese]] hunters preyed on the masses nearby Dalekeva. A dwarf known as [[Dorlas]] heroically slew one of the riders, but died in the process. Mondar and two other dwarves worked through the night to construct a coffin for the dwarven hero. Mondar led the funeral, and invited two of Dorlas's comrades, [[Sunbright Steelshanks]] and [[Greenwillow]], to sprinkle soil upon his coffin before it was sent down the river.

Dorlas's items were distributed by Mondar to other members of the funeral, and the barbarian, Sunbright, accepted Dorlas's [[warhammer]] to honor him. Mondar promised to pass the word to Dorlas' relatives that lived in the [[Iron Mountains]].
