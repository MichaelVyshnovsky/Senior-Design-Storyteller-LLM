        "History": "Gultec was one of the most powerful men in [[Ulatos]], always close to the ruler [[Caxal]] in time of wars.\n\nIn 1361 DR, Gultec and the priest of [[Zaltec]], [[Mixtal]], were tasked by [[Nexal]] high priest [[Hoxitl]] with the mission to capture [[Erixitl]] from the local temple of [[Qotal]] and kill her, despite Mixtal's fear of reprisal.\n\nThey managed to kidnap the girl without anyone noticing, but when Mixtal was ready to deliver the fatal blow, they all saw the arrival of the [[Golden Legion]]'s ships. Erixitl profited from their distraction and escaped.\n\nSoon after, Gultex was called by [[Caxal]] to a war council, together with [[Lok]], the leader of the [[Eagle Knights (Maztica)|Eagle Knights]], to discuss how to fight the strangers.\n\nLater, Gultec and his men were stationed at the pyramid of Zaltec during the supposed sacrifice of Erixitl (in truth the [[Faer√ªn]]ian girl [[Martine (Amnian)|Martine]]) and were the first to fight the legionaries, more precisely, the squad led by [[Daggrande]].\n\nGultec was defeated, and most of his men were killed. He himself managed to escape. Together with Lok and Caxal, he decided to face the invaders at [[Ulatos]].\nGultec personally led the troops in battle, but thanks to the superiority of the [[Amn]]ian troops, the Legion won, inciting terrible losses to the Payits. Gultec was devastated by the loss and considered himself a man with no more utility.\n\nLater, he was kidnapped by warriors of [[Tulom-Itzi]]. In Tulom-Itzi, the local ruler [[Zochimaloc]] tutored Gultec, who, thanks to this training, learned to use all his hidden powers: he learned to [[polymorph]] in all kind of animals, not only [[jaguar]]. Just before the [[Night of Wailing]], Gultec sensing a great danger over all [[Maztica]] decided to go to [[Nexal]], the True Heart of Maztica and probable source of the danger.   \n\nAfter the Night of Wailing, he again met [[Halloran]] and Erixitl, this time becoming their friend.\n\nHowever, after a time, Zochimaloc called him back to Tulom-Itzi. After he was back, Zochimaloc explained that they were menaced by [[Darien]]'s [[giant ant]] army, and they decided to evacuate the city.\nDuring the exodus Gultec lead the [[Itza]] in many skirmish with the giant ants.\nAt last Gultec reunited with Halloran and his party, now bolstered by [[Desert dwarf|desert dwarves]] and [[wild halfling]]s, just after Zochimaloc destroyed the giant ants' army sacrificing his life.\nLater he led the Itza warriors during the Second Battle of Ulatos\nAs of [[1362 DR]] Gultec was the ruler of the rebuilt Tulom-Itzi."
