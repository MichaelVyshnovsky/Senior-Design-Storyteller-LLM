        "mainbody": "Mister Witch, born Naeryx Krumple, was one of the two proprietors of the Witchlight Carnival, a traveling circus that ventured across the Feywild and Prime Material plane.\nThe austere shadar-kai man always distinguished himself from other members of the Carnival by his fine attire, which included a top hat and walking stick.\nMister Witch was an authoritative and stern man who appeared to be outright dour at first glance. He preferred tidiness and structure, and he brought order to any form of chaos he encountered. While he kept focused on the business of carnival operations, he occasionally overlooked any flaws in the staff members he led.\nOnce per day, Mister Witch could evoke the blessing of the Raven Queen, allowing him to teleport himself and some items up to  away.\nPerhaps Mister Witchs most prized possession was his Witchlight Watch, which allowed him to magically facilitate the packing and unpacking of the carnival in the span of a mere hour.\nHe partnered with Mister Light in the running of the Witchlight Carnival. Where Mister Witch was reserved and pragmatic, Mister Light was ostentatious and extravagant.\nHe forged new friendships with several of the carnivals attendees and performers, including Diana Cloppington, Thaco the clown, and the bugbears Hurly and Burly.\nNaeryx Krumple grew up as an orphan in the city of Gloomwrought in the Shadowfell. He managed to live alone on the city streets for a time, and made a living hawking broadsheets and sweeping the floor of an old clocktower. Eventually, Naeryx took up residence within the clocktower and quickly became its resident repairman. After the clocktowers owners invited Naeryx over for supper on several occasions, the young shadar-kai found a connection with their son, Urmius Umbrage. Despite their contrasting personalities and differing backgrounds, the two forged a life-long friendship.\nWhen Urmius bought himself a run-down carnival that lurked across the borders of the Shadowfell, he offered Naeryx the opportunity to oversee its operations. The two went into business together and later encountered an eladrin woman named Isolde―a fellow carnival operator―who would change both of their lives forever.\nWhile the theme of Naeryx and Urmiuss carnival was very much aligned with the Shadowfell, Isoldes traveling festival was a celebration of all things fey. The three owners got into a long discussion about whose carnival was the best, and after drinking much wine, they decided to swap ownership with each other. Isolde took over the dark, shadowy carnival owned by the two friends and, seeing an opportunity to keep away from the gloomy realm in which they grew up, Naeryx and Urmius assumed ownership of the fey carnival. The two friends renamed their traveling attraction the Witchlight Carnival and took on new personas to match. It was then that Naeryx Krumple became Mister Witch. \nSome time later, the two friends entered into an unfortunate agreement with the hags of the Hourglass Coven. The evil fey witches threatened to reunite the Witchlight Carnival with Isolde and the Shadowfell carnival―thus forcing ownership of each carnival to once again change hands―unless they agreed to a bargain anyone caught sneaking into the Witchlight Carnival without a pass could be taken away by any of the covens hags. The two shadar-kai businessmen unfortunately agreed to the dark bargain."
