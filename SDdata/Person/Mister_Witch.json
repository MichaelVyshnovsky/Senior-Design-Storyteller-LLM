        "mainbody": "'''Mister Witch''', born '''Naeryx Krumple''', was one of the two proprietors of the [[Witchlight Carnival]], a traveling circus that ventured across the [[Feywild]] and [[Prime Material plane]].\n\n{{Quote|Attention! Attention please. My name is Mister Witch, one of the proprietors of this carnival. I'm requesting that everyone without a ticket leave the grounds immediately... I certainly won't tolerate any harassment of my employees, be it from unscrupulous racketeers or overzealous law enforcement.|Mister Witch, to a group of [[pixie]]s and [[sprite]]s.{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Annual 2022}}}}",
        "Description": "The austere [[shadar-kai (elf)|shadar-kai]] man always distinguished himself from other members of the Carnival by his fine attire, which included a top hat and walking stick.",
        "Personality": "Mister Witch was an authoritative and stern man who appeared to be outright dour at first glance. He preferred tidiness and structure, and he brought order to any form of chaos he encountered. While he kept focused on the business of carnival operations, he occasionally overlooked any flaws in the staff members he led.",
        "Abilities": "Once per day, Mister Witch could evoke the blessing of the [[Raven Queen]], allowing him to ''[[teleport]]'' himself and some items up to {{SI|30|ft}} away.",
        "Possessions": "Perhaps Mister Witch's most prized possession was his ''[[Witchlight Watch]]'', which allowed him to magically facilitate the packing and unpacking of the carnival in the span of a mere hour.",
        "Relationships": "He partnered with [[Mister Light]] in the running of the Witchlight Carnival. Where Mister Witch was reserved and pragmatic, Mister Light was ostentatious and extravagant.\n\nHe forged new friendships with several of the carnival's attendees and performers, including [[Diana Cloppington]], [[Thaco]] the clown, and the [[bugbear]]s [[Hurly]] and [[Burly]].",
        "History": "Naeryx Krumple grew up as an orphan in the city of [[Gloomwrought]] in the [[Shadowfell]]. He managed to live alone on the city streets for a time, and made a living hawking [[broadsheet]]s and sweeping the floor of an old clocktower. Eventually, Naeryx took up residence within the clocktower and quickly became its resident repairman. After the clocktower's owners invited Naeryx over for supper on several occasions, the young shadar-kai found a connection with their son, [[Urmius Umbrage]]. Despite their contrasting personalities and differing backgrounds, the two forged a life-long friendship.\n\nWhen Urmius bought himself a run-down carnival that lurked across the borders of the Shadowfell, he offered Naeryx the opportunity to oversee its operations. The two went into business together and later encountered an [[eladrin]] woman named [[Isolde (eladrin)|Isolde]]―a fellow carnival operator―who would change both of their lives forever.\n\nWhile the theme of Naeryx and Urmius's carnival was very much aligned with the Shadowfell, Isolde's traveling festival was a celebration of all things [[fey]]. The three owners got into a long discussion about whose carnival was the best, and after drinking much [[wine]], they decided to swap ownership with each other. Isolde took over the dark, shadowy carnival owned by the two friends and, seeing an opportunity to keep away from the gloomy realm in which they grew up, Naeryx and Urmius assumed ownership of the fey carnival. The two friends renamed their traveling attraction the Witchlight Carnival and took on new personas to match. It was then that Naeryx Krumple became Mister Witch. \n\nSome time later, the two friends entered into an unfortunate agreement with the [[hag]]s of the [[Hourglass Coven]]. The evil fey witches threatened to reunite the Witchlight Carnival with Isolde and the Shadowfell carnival―thus forcing ownership of each carnival to once again change hands―unless they agreed to a bargain: anyone caught sneaking into the Witchlight Carnival without a pass could be taken away by any of the coven's hags. The two shadar-kai businessmen unfortunately agreed to the dark bargain."
