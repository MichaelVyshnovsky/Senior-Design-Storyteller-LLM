Alorth Bloodshoulder was a young Zhentilar swordsman in the mid-14 century DR.
He was young.
To his superiors, he was too lippy.
He helped make traps, and acted as muscle within his squad.
He carried a sword and a knife.
He was a young Zhentilar warrior.
He worked together with Guld, and under swordmaster Bluth.
Alorth was part of a group under the control of swordmaster Bluth, sent to ambush and capture Shandril Shessair during her trip through Hullack Forest in late  on the orders of Manshoon. He built a concealed spiked pit trap as part of the ambush he later helped the dwarf Delg Ironstar, accompanying Shandril, out of the trap under duress, as Shandril threatened him with spellfire. When Delg glared at him afterwards, he drew his dagger, and was slain by Shandril Shessair.
