'''Alorth Bloodshoulder''' was a young [[Zhentilar]] swordsman in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was young.

==Personality==
To his superiors, he was too lippy.

==Abilities==
He helped make traps, and acted as muscle within his squad.

==Possessions==
He carried a sword and a knife.

==Activities==
He was a young [[Zhentilar]] warrior.

==Relationships==
He worked together with [[Guld]], and under swordmaster [[Bluth]].

==History==
Alorth was part of a group under the control of swordmaster [[Bluth]], sent to ambush and capture [[Shandril Shessair]] during her trip through [[Hullack Forest]] in late {{yearlink|1357}} on the orders of [[Manshoon]]. He built a concealed spiked pit trap as part of the ambush; he later helped the dwarf [[Delg Ironstar]], accompanying Shandril, out of the trap under duress, as Shandril threatened him with [[spellfire]]. When Delg glared at him afterwards, he drew his dagger, and was slain by Shandril Shessair.
