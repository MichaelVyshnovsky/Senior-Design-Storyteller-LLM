Dharjamyn Thauntle was a cobbler who operated Thauntles Good Heels and Soles in the South Ward of Waterdeep. 
The cobbler had a personal collection of gemstones, but claimed that due to his age, he was unable to search for rare stones in the areas surrounding the city. Instead, Dharjamyn searched for gems on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, which was frowned upon by the City Guard.
Around 1374 DR, Dharjamyn found a number of rubies on Mount Waterdeep, but was warned by city guardsman Horthan Hethdance to stay away from the mountain.
