        "mainbody": "Saeth Cromley () was a retired City Watch sergeant in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.\nSaeth, like his friend Barnibus Blastwind of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, wanted solid evidence and testimonies before ordering arrests. He preferred to not have unauthorized people inside the crime scene. Saeth was a likable fellow with a sharp, sarcastic wit. He was very capable of collecting information from common folk. Once he was very strict about the City Watchs dress code but after his retirement he wore more practical dress.\nSaeth had a working partnership with Barnibus.\nSaeth was once an officer in the City Watch until he decided to retire. Sometimes, however, he helped Barnibus in difficult cases.\nIn 1492 DR, Saeth, together with Barnibus, was called in to investigate the blast that killed ten people in North Ward, including the gnome Dalakhar. He acted as bodyguard and assistant to Barnibus.\nLater, Saeth accompanied Barnibus when he was called in to investigate the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath."
