Hyustus Staget () was a captain of the City Watch 
in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Staget kept peace in the Dock Ward.
Around 1491 DR, Captain Staget was investigating a gang war between the Zhentarim and the Xanathars Thieves Guild. Staget was leading an operation to capture the high-ranking Zhent Urstul Floxin when he and his men were called to an abandoned warehouse that turned out to be a secret Zhent hideout. There he discovered some adventurers and Renaer Neverember.
Staget truly believed in his work to protect the good people of the Dock Ward. He did not care if the Zhentarim and Xanathar minions killed each other.
Staget was known and even appreciated by every shopkeeper, guild member, innkeeper, and tavern keeper in the Dock Ward.
