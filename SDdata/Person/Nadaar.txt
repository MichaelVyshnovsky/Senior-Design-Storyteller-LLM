Nadaar was a dragonborn paladin and an adventurer.
Nadaar was bold and confident, and he liked to explore ancient ruins. And while he enjoyed when his party was caught in some precarious situation, he never let his enjoyment to blunt his alertness.
As a paladin, Nadaars role was to serve as a shield to protect his friends, a role he happily accepted.
Nadaar was part of an adventuring troupe with the bard Ellywick Tumblestrum, the wizard Hama Pashar, and the ranger Varis, who explored ancient ruins across the Realms.
