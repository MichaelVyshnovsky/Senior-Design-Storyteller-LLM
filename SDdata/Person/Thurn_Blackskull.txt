Thurn Blackskull was a male duergar fighter/psion or psychic warrior who worked as a fence in the subterranean city of Skullport in Undermountain around 1370 DR.
Thurn was an aged gray dwarf.
Thurn worked as a fence, specializing in the illicit trade of rare and enchanted weaponry.
Most afternoons, Thurn could be found in the Broken Pike tavern, always with tankard in hand.
Thurn was a crony of Marks, proprietor of the Broken Pike, and an informal advisor to the prominent duergar Thaglar Xundorn.
Thurn Blackskull hailed from the duergar city of Gracklstugh, before coming to Skullport.
However, at some point by 1370 DR, Thurns identity was stolen by the doppelganger Ptola, a local leader of the Unseen. Under the guise of Thurn Blackskull, Ptola carried on his life and trade, and his kin and cronies remained entirely aware of the substitution. This masquerade was maintained until at least 1372 DR.The actual Thurns fate is unknown.
