        "mainbody": "'''Tarak''' was a [[human]] botanist in the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister on [[Stormwreck Isle]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Tarak had pale skin with many freckles, auburn hair, a mostly gray beard, and gray-blue eyes. He had faded [[tattoo]]s on his neck, one of which was a gold hangman's noose, which was the symbol of the [[Gilded Gallows]]. He wore simple [[robe]]s.",
        "Activities": "Like all the other residents of the cloister, Tarak took turns cooking and cleaning up after meals. While left unsaid, Tarak's cooking days were a favorite of all.\n\nTarak came to the cloister library to read and discuss its collection of various [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s with [[Varnoth Wender|Varnoth]] and [[Runara]].\n\nAs a cloister gardener, he cultivated [[flower]]s, [[herb]]s, and [[vegetable]]s.",
        "History": "Tarak was once a [[poison]]er working for the Gilded Gallows, a [[thieves' guild]] that operated in [[Elturgard]]. In the second half of the 15{{th}} century DR, he was ordered to kill his own lover, who had been declared a traitor. Tarak instead chose to flee the guild and his life of crime with his lover. However, his lover was ultimately assassinated by another member of the guild, and the story was twisted to accuse Tarak of murder and theft of a large sum of [[money]]. Tarak managed to escape and settled on Stormwreck Isle in the Dragon's Rest cloister.\n\nSince then, he lived in a small monastic cell and worked as a cloister gardener. By the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} some members of the guild tried to track down Tarak and the wealth he had supposedly secreted away.\n\nOn a frequent basis, he traveled to [[Seagrow Caves]] by rowboat to trade with local [[myconid]]s, giving them food scraps in exchange for the cave's rare [[fungi]]. That way he could obtain [[heart cap mushroom]]s required for [[Potion of healing|potions of healing]], and [[ruby morel]] for [[Elixir of health|elixirs of health]]. In 1481 DR, the myconids ended this trade and installed a [[spore servant octopus]] guarding the entrance to the caves as they feared by a blight spreading through Seagrow Caves and poisoning its inhabitants. Worried by this fact, the botanist tried to find a way to reestablish the trade.\n\nTarak and [[Blepp]] were attacked by [[Zombie|drowned sailors]] when they went fishing. At the point of death, they were rescued thanks to the timely aid of a group of [[adventurer]]s."
