        "mainbody": "Tarak was a human botanist in the Dragons Rest cloister on Stormwreck Isle in the late 15 century DR.\nTarak had pale skin with many freckles, auburn hair, a mostly gray beard, and gray-blue eyes. He had faded tattoos on his neck, one of which was a gold hangmans noose, which was the symbol of the Gilded Gallows. He wore simple robes.\nLike all the other residents of the cloister, Tarak took turns cooking and cleaning up after meals. While left unsaid, Taraks cooking days were a favorite of all.\nTarak came to the cloister library to read and discuss its collection of various books and scrolls with Varnoth and Runara.\nAs a cloister gardener, he cultivated flowers, herbs, and vegetables.\nTarak was once a poisoner working for the Gilded Gallows, a thieves guild that operated in Elturgard. In the second half of the 15 century DR, he was ordered to kill his own lover, who had been declared a traitor. Tarak instead chose to flee the guild and his life of crime with his lover. However, his lover was ultimately assassinated by another member of the guild, and the story was twisted to accuse Tarak of murder and theft of a large sum of money. Tarak managed to escape and settled on Stormwreck Isle in the Dragons Rest cloister.\nSince then, he lived in a small monastic cell and worked as a cloister gardener. By the , some members of the guild tried to track down Tarak and the wealth he had supposedly secreted away.\nOn a frequent basis, he traveled to Seagrow Caves by rowboat to trade with local myconids, giving them food scraps in exchange for the caves rare fungi. That way he could obtain heart cap mushrooms required for potions of healing, and ruby morel for elixirs of health. In 1481 DR, the myconids ended this trade and installed a spore servant octopus guarding the entrance to the caves as they feared by a blight spreading through Seagrow Caves and poisoning its inhabitants. Worried by this fact, the botanist tried to find a way to reestablish the trade.\nTarak and Blepp were attacked by drowned sailors when they went fishing. At the point of death, they were rescued thanks to the timely aid of a group of adventurers."
