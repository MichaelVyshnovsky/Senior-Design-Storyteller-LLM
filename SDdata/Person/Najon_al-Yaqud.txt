'''Najon al-Yaqud''' was once a leader of the nomadic members of [[House Bakr]] in the [[High Desert]].<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37">

==Activities==
Najon was part of a group who overthrew the sultan of [[Tajar]]. He was offered the position of captain of the cavalry of Tajar by the new sultan, but Najon refused the offer and returned to the desert. He had a vision of a beautiful [[marid]] crying because of the sadness that would follow the House of Bakr if they remained in Tajar. He left the next morning for the desert with his son and a group of tribesmen, but promised to aid the sheikh and his descendants should they ever require it.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37"/>

==Relationships==
Najon's son, [[Ajan al-Yaqud|Ajan]] would later take his place to lead the tribe in the desert.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37"/>
