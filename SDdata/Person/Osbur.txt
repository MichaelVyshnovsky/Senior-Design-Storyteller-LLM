Osbur was a servant of the Oldbridle family in the late 15 century DR.
He served Olgarth Oldbridle, and after his death, Elbert Oldbridle.
In the aftermath of the Council of the Dragon in the year , he received orders from Lord Olgarth Oldbridle to, in case he did not return alive from his dinner with Andranth Glarvreth, deliver a warning unto his son, Elbert Oldbridle. Elbert in turn instructed him to repeat the warning unto Traevyn Illance Osbur found him in Staghaven House, and repeated that warning while Lord Illance was in the company of Broryn Windstag, Sacrast Handragon, Marlin Stormserpent, Irlin Stonestable, and Mellast Ormblade.
