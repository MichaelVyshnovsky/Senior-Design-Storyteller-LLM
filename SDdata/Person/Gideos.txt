'''Gideos''' was the [[mind flayer]] leader of the [[Bloodrovers]], a pirate group that operated in [[Avernus]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|8-9}}

==Description==
Gideos wore an eye patch over its left eye, which concealed a [[gem]] that, when exposed, amplified its [[telepathy|telepathic]] capabilities.

==Activities==
The Bloodrovers, led by Gideos, roamed the blasted wasteland of Avernus in a fleet of [[infernal war machine]]s in search for treasure and ''[[soul coin]]s''. The pirate band included [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, and other [[humanoid]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Gideos witnessed the pulling of [[Elturel]] into Avernus. Seeing the event as an opportunity, it commanded the Bloodrovers to sabotage the machines that operated the chains that were pulling the city down, in an attempt to steal the stash of ''soul coins'' that fueled them.

During the attack, the pirates inadvertently captured [[Minsc]] and [[Nerys Kathon|Nerys]]. As they attempted to escape and fend off the counterattacking [[demon]]s, Minsc, Nerys, and the infernal war machine that had captured them fell into the [[Styx]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|9-14}} The pirates rescued them, but Minsc completely lost his memory as a result of being exposed to the river's waters.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|19-20}}

After the rescue, Gideos commanded the Bloodrovers to enter the fortress that housed one of the chains binding Elturel. With help from Nerys and a confused Minsc, the group successfully sabotaged four of the eight chains that held the city and collected a substantial amount of ''soul coins''. Gideos regarded the heist as the greatest in Hells' history.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|2-4,9}}
