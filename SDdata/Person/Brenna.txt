Brenna was a human adventurer and leader of the Puppetmasters company circa 1369 DR.
She was a humorless and serious person, who went about her life in a ruthless, pragmatic manner. She was almost fearless in combat, and had no tolerance for anyone who failed to live up to her expectations.
Brennas favored weapon was a powerful +2 longsword of sharpness, backed up with a magical +2 short bow and a quiver of enchanted +2 sheaf arrows. She wore chain mail and a +2 ring of protection.
In 1369 DR, she came up with a scheme to win an easy prize for her company. She planted a letter and treasure map that led to the dungeon of Barrenstone, allowing another adventuring group to excavate and clear out the complex. When they emerged from the dungeon with the treasure, the Puppetmasters attempted to rob their victims, only to be driven off and receive nothing for their troubles.
