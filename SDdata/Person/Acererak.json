        "History": "[[File:Acererak candlekeep.jpg|thumb|''Depiction of Acererak from the [[Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation]]'']]\nMuch of Acererak's past history was forgotten. It was believed that he was originally from [[Oerth]]. It is, however, believed that he was a Cambion and the offspring of a human mother named Kecethri and a Balor father named Tarnhem.\n\nAs he worked to achieve lichdom Acererak constructed a number of dungeons and tombs in order to draw out, defeat, and claim for his phylactery the souls of [[adventurer]]s that sought to destroy him. One particular dungeon hidden within a hillside, known as the [[Tomb of Horrors]], would go on to claim the lives of thousands of adventurers. It would also attract the attention of many [[necromancer]]s, who would go on to construct a settlement around the hillside to worship Acererak.\n\nAt some point, Acererak gave a ''[[mirror of life trapping]]'' to [[Malcanthet]], who promised to fill it with trapped souls and return it to his tomb.\n\nAt some point in the 15th century DR, Acererak went to [[Chult]] and defeated the [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Chult|Nine Trickster Gods]] of [[Omu]]. He then enslaved the Omuans and forced them to build the Tomb of the Nine Gods. Acererak killed all the Omuans after the tomb was completed, and buried them alongside their gods.\n\nAt some unknown time not long before the late 1480s DR, Acererak traveled to the [[Negative Energy plane]] and found an [[atropal]] there, which he decided to nourish to godhood. For that purpose, he built a powerful artifact called the Soulmonger and placed it in one of the tombs he possessed, the Tomb of the Nine Gods, and used the [[Sewn Sisters]] as protectors of both the atropol and the Soulmonger. The tomb served as the atropal's nursery while the artifact nourished it by trapping the souls of the dead and draining the souls of those who had been beneficiaries of [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]] magic. This was known as the death curse. Not much else is known until he built his famous tomb of horrors.\n\n{{Quote\n|In retrospect, I might have gone a little overboard. The best traps make their prisoners suffer and scream. Adventurers who visit my tomb die too quickly.\n|The epitaph of Acererak, [[demilich]]\n}}"
