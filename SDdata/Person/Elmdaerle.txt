Elmdaerle, also known as the Herb Man to many Cormyreans, was a scholar and sage who lived in Arabel, Cormyr in 1367 DR.
Elmdaerle was an expert on the local flora and fauna, earning him his nickname. In addition to owning the Falcons Rest inn, which he rarely visited unless he had a new specimen to mount, the sage was also the guildmaster of the Guild of Naturalists.
One of the most renowned moments in Elmdaerles life was saving a visiting noble from food poisoning by providing them a botanical antitode.
When Elmdaerle caught wind that Twick, a local Chauntean cleric, had been dispatched by his temple to minister to the Marsh Drovers he summoned him to his home and regaled him with some of the legends surrounding Cormyrs swamplands. By the end of their meeting he requested that the cleric investigate some of those legends while there.
At some point Elmdaerle gave a detailed address on the ecology of stirges to the Guild of Naturalists.
