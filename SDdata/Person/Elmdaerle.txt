'''Elmdaerle''', also known as the '''Herb Man''' to many [[Cormyrean]]s, was a scholar and [[sage]] who lived in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]] in [[1367 DR]].
 
==Activities==
Elmdaerle was an expert on the local flora and fauna, earning him his nickname. In addition to owning the [[Falcon's Rest]] [[inn]], which he rarely visited unless he had a new specimen to mount, the sage was also the guildmaster of the [[Guild of Naturalists]].

==History==
One of the most renowned moments in Elmdaerle's life was saving a visiting noble from food [[poison]]ing by providing them a botanical antitode.

When Elmdaerle caught wind that [[Twick]], a local [[Chauntea]]n [[cleric]], had been dispatched by his temple to minister to the [[Marsh Drover]]s he summoned him to his home and regaled him with some of the legends surrounding Cormyr's swamplands. By the end of their meeting he requested that the cleric investigate some of those legends while there.

At some point Elmdaerle gave a detailed address on the ecology of [[stirge]]s to the Guild of Naturalists.<ref>{{Cite dragon/83/Ecology of the Stirge}}
