Uxma the Sorcerer was a wise elder in Maztica in 1362 DR.
Uxma was a sage specializing in the fields of Maztican art and architecture, astronomy, Maztican history and folklore, and music.
Uxma lived as a hermit in the Payit region. Usually, people of nearby villages consulted him about their most troubling problems in exchange for gifts. Near his house lived a dragonne, Chalocka. Uxma allowed it to stay in the area to discourage visitors.
Uxma was a benevolent individual, especially liking artists. However, he was very terse with people he considered fools. He enjoyed his image as a powerful and mysterious sorcerer.
