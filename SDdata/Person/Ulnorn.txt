'''Ulnorn, blood of Jalabar''' was one of the [[dwarves]] who would found the kingdom of [[Roldilar]] in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faer√ªn]] in the 7th century [[DR]]. He was a warrior and a descendent of [[Jalabar]].

==History==
After its forging and enchantment in [[605 DR|the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR]], the magical sword [[Sarghathuld|''Sarghathuld'', or "Orcbane"]] was given to Ulnorn. Wielding Orcbane, Ulnorn fought with courage in the dwarves' battles against the [[orc]]s of [[Vastar]], culminating in that realm's fall in [[610 DR|the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]], and the rise of the dwarven kingdom of Roldilar.

Ulnorn later journeyed to [[Myth Drannor]] in its heyday, and there dwarven craftsmen and elven mages further enchanted ''Sarghathuld''. But with the fall of Myth Drannor in [[714 DR|the Year of Doom, 714 DR]], ''Sarghathuld'' disappeared from history for almost twenty years.{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}} <ref group="note">Ulnorn's fate is not stated, but given the circumstances and loss of ''Sarghathuld'', it may be presumed he fell in the fall of Myth Drannor.
