        "mainbody": "'''Derwin Stonecarver''' was a [[shield dwarf]] of [[Clan Ironeater]] who lived in [[Daggerford]] during the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries DR.",
        "Possessions": "In addition to the [[anvil]]-shaped [[altar of Imix]] Derwin brought home from his travels, he also possessed an enchanted [[warhammer]] which was buried with him when he died. ''[[Derwin's hammer]]'' was the only means to destroy the altar and retrieve the elemental [[Fire Key]] sealed within it.",
        "Activities": "The [[fresco|frescoes]] painted on Derwin's [[sarcophagus]] showed that in addition to his discovery of the altar, he was remembered for drinking much [[ale]] and battling many [[orc]]s, though he ultimately died of natural causes.",
        "Relationships": "Derwin was a brother to [[Derval Ironeater]] and [[Korin Ironaxe]]. Derwin was well-loved by his brothers, and they commissioned a [[granite]] statue of him after his passing.",
        "History": "After the {{YearlinkName|1257}}, when the Ironeater clan abandoned their home beneath [[Mount Illefarn]], Derwin took up travelling. During his travels, he came to possess a massive altar in the shape of an anvil, which he mistakenly believed was dedicated to [[Moradin]]. When he returned to his brothers who had settled in Daggerford, Korin interpreted the altar's arrival as an omen that it was time to return to their tunnels.\n\nCirca the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, during the earthquake that struck [[Daggerford]], Derwin and his two sons were trapped beneath the rubble when the town barracks' north wall partially collapsed."
