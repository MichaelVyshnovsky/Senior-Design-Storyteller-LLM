Orvustia Esseren was a guard on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
The guard was smart, tough, and talented with her bow and spear but knew nothing of the Realms outside her homeland.
Around 1489 DR, Orvustia followed the advice of her aunt and left her home on a farm near Baldurs Gate to see the world. She found work as a guard for a great caravan that, unknown to her, was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
