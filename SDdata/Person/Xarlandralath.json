        "mainbody": "arlandralath, spawn of Xorlughra, was one of the beholders in the service of Manshoon in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.\nIn beholder shape, Xarlandralath was the size of a coach, with a central eye the size of a table above a fanged maw, and ten smaller eyes on stalks protruding from its spherical body.\nIt was magically compelled into service by Manshoon.\nAs a beholder, it launched rays from its eyes.\nAfter the catastrophic Council of the Dragon of the , the vampire archmage Manshoon sent Xarlandralath, one of his beholders, after the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar, whom hed identified as inhabiting the body of Amarune Whitewave, a coinlass and mask dancer.\nThe beholder came into conflict with a number of Purple Dragons and War Wizards along the way to Castle Obarskyr, where Amarune was. Unknown to both it and Manshoon, Elminster was actually residing in the body of the noble heir Arclath Delcastle. The wizard cast a spell to temporarily wrestle the beholder back into its true shape, and free of compulsions, revealing a mans body during a brief fall. The beholder cried out for release from Manshoons control at that moment.\nThe War Wizards and Purple Dragons managed to slay Xarlandralath shortly after that."
