        "Description": "In beholder shape, Xarlandralath was the size of a coach, with a central eye the size of a table above a fanged maw, and ten smaller eyes on stalks protruding from its spherical body.",

        "History": "After the catastrophic [[Council of the Dragon]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent Xarlandralath, one of his beholders, after the fugitive wizard [[Elminster Aumar]], whom he'd identified as inhabiting the body of [[Amarune Whitewave]], a [[coinlass]] and [[mask dancer]].\n\nThe beholder came into conflict with a number of [[Purple Dragons]] and [[War Wizards]] along the way to [[Castle Obarskyr]], where Amarune was. Unknown to both it and Manshoon, Elminster was actually residing in the body of the noble heir [[Arclath Delcastle]]. The wizard cast a spell to temporarily wrestle the beholder back into its true shape, and free of compulsions, revealing a man's body during a brief fall. The beholder cried out for release from Manshoon's control at that moment.\n\nThe War Wizards and Purple Dragons managed to slay Xarlandralath shortly after that."
