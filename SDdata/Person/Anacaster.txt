'''Anacaster''' was a skilled [[wizard]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, centuries before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Anacaster was famous for his use of magical ''[[gate]]s'' placed within Waterdeep, specifically within the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]]. One such gate found within the [[Mariners' Rest]] tomb led to a [[plane]] with an infinite number of burial plots that sat next to a placid lake. He left similar ''gates'' within the [[Hall of Heroes (tomb)|Hall of Heroes]], [[Merchants' Rest]], and the [[House of the Homeless]].
