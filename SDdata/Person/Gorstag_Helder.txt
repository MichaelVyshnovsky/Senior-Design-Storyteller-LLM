'''Gorstag Helder''' was one of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s agents during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Under orders from his draconic master, Gorstag joined a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell in [[Lyrabar]] in 1373 DR. He managed to steal a folio of valuable documents written by [[Sammaster]]. However, Gorstag was discovered in the act, and in the escape from the cult's hideout he was severely wounded. Pursued through the streets by the cultists and their [[wyvern]] and [[zombie]] minions, Gorstag was saved by his fencing master, [[Taegan Nightwind]], who defeated the attackers. Gorstag soon died of his injuries, but not before giving Taegan the stolen documents and warning him about the dangers posed by Sammaster and the Cult.
