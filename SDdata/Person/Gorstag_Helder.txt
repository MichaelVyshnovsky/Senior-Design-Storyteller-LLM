Gorstag Helder was one of Brimstones agents during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR.
Under orders from his draconic master, Gorstag joined a Cult of the Dragon cell in Lyrabar in 1373 DR. He managed to steal a folio of valuable documents written by Sammaster. However, Gorstag was discovered in the act, and in the escape from the cults hideout he was severely wounded. Pursued through the streets by the cultists and their wyvern and zombie minions, Gorstag was saved by his fencing master, Taegan Nightwind, who defeated the attackers. Gorstag soon died of his injuries, but not before giving Taegan the stolen documents and warning him about the dangers posed by Sammaster and the Cult.
