Brian, known as Brian the Swordmaster, was a Masked Lord of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Brian was bald with a black beard and a permanent scowl. His eyes were gray. As a swordsmith and armorer, he had a strong physique.
Brian liked to look at things directly and in a straightforward manner.
Brian owned a smith and shop in the Southern Ward. His home was located above the shop. He worked among the common folk of Waterdeep.
Brian was one of the "Like-Minded Lords" in 1364 DR (Mirt, Khelben, Durnan, Kitten, and Larissa), who frequently met up to enjoy each others company.)
In the , Brian and his fellow Lords of Waterdeep joined other leaders of the North in negotiations with Prince Aglarel Tanthul of Thultanthar, to discuss the tentative alliance that had formed between the Shadovar and other cities like Evereska and Waterdeep. During the meeting Brian became enraged by Aglarels presumption and arrogance, and he openly insulted the Prince of Shade. This slight led to Thultanthars offer of a formal alliance being withdrawn and the promise of further aid to Waterdeep being rescinded.
