Bralatar was a malaugrym in the mid–14 century DR.
In the , Bralatar and Lorgyn managed to find a new gate to Faerûn. There, they discovered that the Great Foe of the malaugrym, Elminster, had been killed during the second battle of Shadowdale. So Bralatar and Lorgyn went to Sembia to collect magic from the wizards of that land. There they killed the wizard Mortoth and ran into their fellow malaugrym Lunquar, who was busy killing local Zhentarim. They decided to check Elminsters tower, hoping to find the secrets of Malaug. Back at the Tower of Mortoth, however, Bralatar was killed in a sudden attack by Irendue Nuen-tar, Mortoths most promising apprentice.
