'''Alad bin Alaq bin Alonka''' was the Padishah of [[Medina al-Afyal]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

Alad had a slew of titles and nicknames including '''His Most Enlightened and Resplendent Majesty''', '''Servant of the Grand Caliph''', '''Blood of Conquerers''', '''Father of Multitudes''', and '''Wise and Sage Master of His Own Destiny''', but the one that stuck with him most was the '''Mad Padishah'''.

==Personality==
Alad was quite demented and an extremely unpredictable person.

==Activities==
Some of Alad's bizarre whims included appointing [[adventurer]]s and beggars as his ambassadors to other lands simply because he liked the way they looked. He exiled venerable members of the court after overhearing a single crass remark made about him. He ordered several building to be destroyed and had their reconstruction begin weeks later.

==Relationships==
Alad firstborn son, [[Alakbar bin Alad bin Alaq|Alakbar]], disappeared at sea in [[1363 DR]] and had not been seen since. His daughter [[Alina bint Alad|Alina]] was his only surviving offspring.

His aunt on his father's side was [[Alia Jamal]]. Alad preferred if she had no role in his life at all but was unable to banish her.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some natives of Medina al-Afyal believed the padisha's madness was the result of some great horror he experienced in the jungles when he was younger. Others thought the royal bloodline had just begun to run thin after half a millenia of rulership.
