Otiluke () was an eminent otherworldly mage. His works, particularly his spells, were known all over the Realms.
The collection of works of the legendary wizard was a staple part of a mages studies in Faer√ªn. Three of his spells were frequently used Otilukes telekinetic sphere, Otilukes freezing sphere, and Otilukes resilient sphere.
Otiluke was a member of the Circle of Eight, which was led by Mordenkainen. However, both Otiluke and Bigby (who was also known of in the Realms) were killed by Rary the Traitor.
Tenser wore the enchanted item called the Hood of the Weave during the ceremony of being inducted into the Circle of Eight on the world of Oerth. The hood would eventually find its way to Toril, but following the ceremony, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser. However, thanks to the hood, they found their vodka glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy pixies.
In the 14 century DR, two mages of the Realms (Robillard and Harkle Harpell), engaged in a spell competition. During the competition, Robillard used a diamond worth a thousand gold to demonstrate his knowledge of Otiluke, referring to him by name. Harkle did not know so much about the legendary mage, and so Robillard cast another variation of Otilukes spells, namedropping him once again. Harkle was impressed by Robillards display.
