'''Otiluke''' ({{Pronounce|O|ti|look|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was an eminent otherworldly [[mage]]. His works, particularly his [[spell]]s, were known all over the [[Realms]].

==Description==
The collection of works of the legendary [[wizard]] was a staple part of a mage's studies in [[Faer√ªn]]. Three of his spells were frequently used: ''[[Otiluke's telekinetic sphere]]'', ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]'', and ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]''.

==History==
Otiluke was a member of the [[Circle of Eight]], which was led by [[Mordenkainen]]. However, both Otiluke and [[Bigby]] (who was also known of in the Realms) were killed by [[Rary|Rary the Traitor]].

[[Tenser]] wore the [[enchanted]] item called the ''[[Hood of the Weave]]'' during the ceremony of being inducted into the Circle of Eight on the world of Oerth. The hood would eventually find its way to Toril, but following the ceremony, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser. However, thanks to the hood, they found their [[vodka]] glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy [[pixie]]s.

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], two mages of the Realms ([[Robillard]] and [[Harkle Harpell]]), engaged in a spell competition. During the competition, Robillard used a [[diamond]] worth a thousand gold to demonstrate his knowledge of Otiluke, referring to him by name. Harkle did not know so much about the legendary mage, and so Robillard cast another variation of Otiluke's spells, namedropping him once again. Harkle was impressed by Robillard's display.
