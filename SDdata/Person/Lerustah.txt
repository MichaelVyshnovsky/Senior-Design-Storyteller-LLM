'''Lerustah Half-face''' was the captain of the ''[[Frostskimmr]]'', a ship that regularly ventured across the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
His name originated from the fact the right half of his face was horribly scarred, resulting from a terrific bout of [[frostbite (condition)|frostbite]]. He often covered his scar with a leather hood tied closely over his face.

==Personality==
He was considered quite the courageous explored and an expert seaman.

==Activities==
Captain Lerustah led a crew of two score sailors.

==Relationships==
Due to his regular trips to their lands, Lerustah was fairly knowledgeable about the tribes of [[Ice Hunters]] in [[the North]].

==History==
Some time in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Lerustah and the ''Frostskimmr'' were commissioned to take a group of [[adventurer]]s from Waterdeep north to [[Oyaviggaton]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].
