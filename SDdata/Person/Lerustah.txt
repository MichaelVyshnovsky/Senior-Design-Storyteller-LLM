Lerustah Half-face was the captain of the Frostskimmr, a ship that regularly ventured across the Sea of Moving Ice circa the late 15 century DR.
His name originated from the fact the right half of his face was horribly scarred, resulting from a terrific bout of frostbite. He often covered his scar with a leather hood tied closely over his face.
He was considered quite the courageous explored and an expert seaman.
Captain Lerustah led a crew of two score sailors.
Due to his regular trips to their lands, Lerustah was fairly knowledgeable about the tribes of Ice Hunters in the North.
Some time in the 1480s DR, Lerustah and the Frostskimmr were commissioned to take a group of adventurers from Waterdeep north to Oyaviggaton in the Sea of Moving Ice.
