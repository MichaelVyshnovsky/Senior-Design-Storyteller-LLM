'''Tamaeril Bladesemmer''' was a noble and [[Masked Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Appearance==
As of {{yearlink|1355}}, she was gray-haired.

==Possessions==
She carried a dagger and an enchanted amulet.

==Abilities==
Even in the instants before her death, she employed spells that allowed her to open a door, drop a drinking vessel on a foe's head, a cantrip to pull on the rug beneath another's feet, and finally, she cast a spell for a message of hers to be sent directly to the mind of [[Mirt the Moneylender]], almost certainly ''[[sending]]''.

==Relationships==
She was a widow, who owned a dog named [[Borgul (dog)|Borgul]], a songbird, and at least one cat. [[Elminster Aumar]] had tutored her at one point.

==History==
Tamaeril Bladesemmer had been a Masked Lord for nine years, and had adventured with [[Mirt]] at some point in the past as of early [[Flamerule]] in {{yearlink|1355}}. She was the oldest of all the Lords, indicating she was older than Mirt or [[Durnan]]. One night in that month she was attacked by [[Amril Zoar]], who also killed her dog and her songbird. She managed to cast a spell warning Mirt that her slayer was a mage who claimed to be after the Lords of Waterdeep.
