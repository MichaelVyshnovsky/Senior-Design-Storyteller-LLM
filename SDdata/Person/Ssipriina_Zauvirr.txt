'''Ssipriina Zauvirr''' was the [[matron mother]] of [[House Zauvirr]] in [[Ched Nasad]].

==History==
In [[1018 DR]] Ssipriina become matron mother betraying her own mother [[Sheeva Zauvirr]] to [[House Nasadra]] and [[House Baenre]] of [[Menzoberranzan]].

In [[1372 DR]], Ssipriina led House Zauvirr in an attempt to defeat [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]]. She hired the [[duergar]] mercenary band [[Clan Xornbane]], with the help of [[Zammzt]], to assist. She took over the [[Black Claw Mercantile Company]] storehouse, which was operated by House Zauvirr, House Melarn, and the [[Menzoberranzan|Menzoberranyr]] [[House Baenre]]. She ordered Clan Xornbane to kill Matron Mother [[Drisinil Melarn]]. Ssipriina's daughter, [[Faeryl Zauvirr]], also betrayed [[Quenthel Baenre]] and her protector [[Jeggred Baenre|Jeggred]] by leading the two to her mother to be captured.

However, Clan Xornbane was given the direction to attack House Melarn prematurely. Their [[stonefire]] bombs contributed to chaos in the city. Angry at the disruption to her plans, Ssiipriina turned on them, killing the leader of the clan, [[Khorrl Xornbane]], and causing the rest of the band to flee. However, the duergar's stonefire (as part of a [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] plot directed by Zammzt) rapidly destroyed the city.
