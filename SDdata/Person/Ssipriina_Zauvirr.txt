Ssipriina Zauvirr was the matron mother of House Zauvirr in Ched Nasad.
In 1018 DR Ssipriina become matron mother betraying her own mother Sheeva Zauvirr to House Nasadra and House Baenre of Menzoberranzan.
In 1372 DR, Ssipriina led House Zauvirr in an attempt to defeat House Melarn. She hired the duergar mercenary band Clan Xornbane, with the help of Zammzt, to assist. She took over the Black Claw Mercantile Company storehouse, which was operated by House Zauvirr, House Melarn, and the Menzoberranyr House Baenre. She ordered Clan Xornbane to kill Matron Mother Drisinil Melarn. Ssipriinas daughter, Faeryl Zauvirr, also betrayed Quenthel Baenre and her protector Jeggred by leading the two to her mother to be captured.
However, Clan Xornbane was given the direction to attack House Melarn prematurely. Their stonefire bombs contributed to chaos in the city. Angry at the disruption to her plans, Ssiipriina turned on them, killing the leader of the clan, Khorrl Xornbane, and causing the rest of the band to flee. However, the duergars stonefire (as part of a Jaezred Chaulssin plot directed by Zammzt) rapidly destroyed the city.
