        "mainbody": "'''Sovendahl Erkinze''' was a [[drow]] cultist of [[Talos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the second-in-command to [[Gadrille]], who was in charge of the cult's operations in the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]].",
        "Personality": "Sovendahl acted cautiously and calculated, in contrast to his reckless superior. He was loyal to the [[Cult of Talos]], but not to the point of placing the cult above his self-preservation.",
        "Abilities": "Sovendahl was a brave and skilled drow fighter, proficient with the [[short sword]] and [[hand crossbow]].",
        "Possessions": "Sovendahl owned a ''[[dagger of venom]]''.",
        "Activities": "Sovendahl was responsible for managing the sorting, transportation, and sale of stolen commodities seized from destroyed ships by the cult.",
        "Relationships": "Sovendahl had been appointed as Gadrille's second-in-command by [[Fheralai Stormsworn]], the leader of the Talos cult. Fheralai found that Gadrille's unwavering commitment to Talos cult made her a formidable and feared, but at times an unpredictable lieutenant. To keep her zeal in check, Sovendahl was tasked with helping Gadrille but also keeping a watch on her unstable tendencies.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]] Sovendahl disapproved of some of Gadrille's more reckless actions, judging them too dangerous and likely to attract unwanted attention. He secretly met with Fheralai, urging her to put a stop to it. Gadrille complied with Fheralai's request but prayed to Talos to punish Sovendahl. The god answered her prayers and cursed Sovendahl.\n\nWhile Sovendahl suffered from his curse and delegated his responsibilities to his bodyguards, the Thunder Cliff Caves were attacked by a group of [[adventurer]]s. Sovendahl fought well against the attackers, but when offered the opportunity, he was willing to leave the cult in order to receive a cure for his curse."
