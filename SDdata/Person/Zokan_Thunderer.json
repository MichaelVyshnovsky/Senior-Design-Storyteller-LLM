        "mainbody": "'''Zokan Thunderer''' was the chieftain of the [[Elk tribe]] of the [[Uthgardt]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Zokan was well known for his barbaric nature. He was regarded as possibly the ugliest, rudest, richest, wiliest, and the most feared and hated bandit leader in the [[North]].",
        "Activities": "His warriors raided incessantly, at least where the usual tribal migrations of the Elk took them, which ranged around the [[Evermoors]] and the plains east of the [[Dessarin]]. Under Zokan, almost any traveler or region was fair game, including other Uthgardt tribes. They were suspected of having links to [[Luskan]], and under Zokan [[cleric]]s of [[Talos]] gained ground. \n\nHe worshiped [[Auril]] and Talos.",
        "Reputation": "To those outside of his tribe, Zokan was considered to be little more than a vulgar thug."
