        "mainbody": "'''Eiruk Weskur''' was a young [[human]] [[wizard]] of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "Eiruk had black hair that he often worn shorn short in a [[skullcap (cap)|skullcap]].",
        "History": "Eiruk joined the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] around [[1473 DR]]. \n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Eiruk was recruited by [[Khondar Naomal|Khondar \"Ten-Rings\" Naomal]] to aid the [[Blackstaff]], [[Samark Dhanzscul]], in retrieving an item from the tomb of [[Sarael Arunsun]]. Eiruk was familiar enough with the Blackstaff to recognize that the man presenting himself was Samark was an impostor ([[Centiv Naomal]]). However, he was unable to do anything but help the impostor retrieve the item, which would give Khondar the clues he needed to gain the keys to access to [[Blackstaff Tower]]. Only an honest and just person (in this case Eiruk) could receive the item; that person also received an invisible, magical mark. Because he had the mark, Eiruk was made the backup heir to the [[Blackstaff]].  When Khondar tried to retrieve the keys from [[Ompahr Daergech]], Ompahr saw that Khondar did not have the correct mark and so gave him the \"wrong\" set of keys.\n\nWhen Laraelra, [[Renaer Neverember]], [[Meloon Wardragon]], and others were accused by Khondar of murdering Vajra, Eiruk initially joined other wizards in his guild in an attempt to capture them.  Eiruk switched sides after witnessing a battle between mages from the Watchful Order and Laraelra's friends and he helped return Vajra to [[Blackstaff Tower]] because he had a crush on her. The crush made her feel uncomfortable, so she decided to make [[Laraelra Harsard]] her heir instead of him.\n\nEiruk was later made one of the founding members of the group organized by Renaer to replace the [[Moonstars]].",
        "Relationships": "Eiruk's mother was named [[Ainla]]."
