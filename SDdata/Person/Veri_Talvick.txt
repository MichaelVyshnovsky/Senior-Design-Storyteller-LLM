Veri Talvick was one of the neighbors of the ex-Harper thief named Edgin Darvis in the town of Targos, active in the late 15 century DR.
Veri Talvick and her husband Jon lived next door to Edgin and were friends of his deceased wife Zia. When Ed was left alone with a newborn, the Talvicks happily babysat young Kira. Jon and Veris nine-year-old daughter Miriam adored the newborn and happily took care of her when Edgin needed help.
Veri and her family babysat Kira when Edgin and his new friend Holga Kilgore embarked on their first heist – Pendros Pawnshop in Targos. Nine years later, Jon and Veris youngest child – Sief, accompanied his father to the Trip and Shuffle tavern for dinner, while Veri and Miriam kept an eye on Kira. To the familys horror, Sief was grabbed by a band of robbing marauding gnolls and left Jon hurt with a broken ankle.
Edgin, Holga, and their new thieving ally – Forge Fitzwilliam, set out to find the marauders and recover the groups stolen gold, unaware of a kidnapped child. After a wild fight and cunning use of hungry stirges, Sief was rescued and returned to the Talvicks. The deed made Edgin and his crew Targos heroes.
