'''Saddam Hasan ibn Arvalas''' was a master mechanician and the guildmaster of the [[Hands of Time]], a mechanician's guild and shop in [[Sigil]] in the [[Outlands]].

==Abilities==
Saddam was an expert in the field of [[golem]] creation, and could easily construct the framework for [[clay golem|clay]], [[stone golem|stone]], and [[iron golem]]s, as well as more complex forms of automata. His specialization was using [[magic]] to animate mechanical creations.

==History==
Originally hailing from [[Toril]], Saddam was once apprenticed to [[Trobriand]], a powerful disciple of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] who specialized in mechanical creations. He assumed leadership of the Hands of Time when Trobriand stepped down.

==Activities==
Saddam oversaw the Hands of Time, a loosely organized guild and shop of mechanical tinkers from a variety of backgrounds, including [[modron]]s, [[aasimon]], [[gnome]]s, and [[dwarf|dwarves]].

When conversing with customers, Saddam was not loath to refer to his studies under Trobriand.

He was a member of the [[Fraternity of Order]] faction.
