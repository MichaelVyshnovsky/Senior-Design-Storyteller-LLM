Saddam Hasan ibn Arvalas was a master mechanician and the guildmaster of the Hands of Time, a mechanicians guild and shop in Sigil in the Outlands.
Saddam was an expert in the field of golem creation, and could easily construct the framework for clay, stone, and iron golems, as well as more complex forms of automata. His specialization was using magic to animate mechanical creations.
Originally hailing from Toril, Saddam was once apprenticed to Trobriand, a powerful disciple of Halaster Blackcloak who specialized in mechanical creations. He assumed leadership of the Hands of Time when Trobriand stepped down.
Saddam oversaw the Hands of Time, a loosely organized guild and shop of mechanical tinkers from a variety of backgrounds, including modrons, aasimon, gnomes, and dwarves.
When conversing with customers, Saddam was not loath to refer to his studies under Trobriand.
He was a member of the Fraternity of Order faction.
