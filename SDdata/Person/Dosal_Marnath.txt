'''Dosal Marnath''' was a [[spectre]] within [[Hellgate Keep]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Dosal's mind was consumed by thoughts of anger and hate.

==Abilities==
As a master spectre, Dosal was able to create spectre servants.

==Activities==
Following the destruction of Hellgate Keep, Dosal spent his days roaming the halls of the fortress's Deep Garrison alongside his three spectre servants, killing any defenseless creature they encountered.

==History==
In life, Dosal was a minor [[wizard]] living in the fortress town of Ascalhorn. Like many of the town's magic-users, he summoned [[baatezu]] to help him gain power.

Dosal's hatred and outrage over his servants' betrayal was so great that his spirit rose as a spectre. For a short time, he took out his rage on all that crossed his path: baatezu, tanar'ri, and even former allies in life. His rampage ended with him being imprisoned in a [[gem]] and left forgotten inside a crypt. When Hellgate Keep was destroyed centuries later, this gem shattered, unleashing him, and he proceeded to torment the nearby tanar'ri and [[tanarukk]]a. He would later turn the spirits of three tanarukka into his own personal spectre servants.
