        "History": "Born in [[Calimshan]] to a satrap, at an early age Yajandra was uninterested in local intrigues but had an aptitude for magic. So she cut ties with her family and trained as wizard under [[Asheund]].\n\nLater, Yajandra went on a spell-trading trip to [[Amn]]. She disappeared for some years studying [[dragon]]s. She resurfaced visiting [[Candlekeep]] and later in [[Zazesspur]] where she studied with the sage [[Cthethros]], a great dragon expert.\n\nLater Yajandra wandered Amn together with the disguised [[gold dragon]] [[Sandro]] until a [[Harper]] told her about the [[Well of Dragons]].\n\nYajandra bought a house in the nearby village of [[Ladydove]] and hers was the only house to survive an attack from the [[Dire Dragon]]. So Yajandra transformed the house into an inn and continued her dragon studies with the profits of the inn."
