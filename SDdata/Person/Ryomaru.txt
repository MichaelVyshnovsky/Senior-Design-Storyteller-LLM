Perhaps his most famous weapon was Ryomarus Harmless Staff, a hollowed-out, ingeniously designed and ensorcelled quarterstaff. Ryomaru only used the weapon on three missions, after which he abandoned it for more cunning and dangerous weapons. Ryomarus Harmless Staff was left at the Hojori Temple, a front for the Kumo clan, only to be stolen later by the famous thief named "Chicken" Wu-Wei.
