'''Ryomaru''' was one of the greatest [[assassin]]s and spies of the [[Kumo]] clan of [[Kozakura]], many years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Decades before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Ryomaru was renowned as one of the best at what he did. Perhaps his most famous weapon was ''[[Ryomaru's Harmless Staff]]'', a hollowed-out, ingeniously designed and ensorcelled [[quarterstaff]]. Ryomaru only used the weapon on three missions, after which he abandoned it for more cunning and dangerous weapons. ''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff'' was left at the [[Hojori Temple]], a front for the Kumo clan, only to be stolen later by the famous [[thief]] named "Chicken" [[Wu-Wei]].
