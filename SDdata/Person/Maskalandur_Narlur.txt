{{quote|Such a one I've not seen before, nor expect her like again. Calm, disinterested in great wealth or vainglory, above all fair and principled. She hardly seems a dragon at all!|Narlur on Taraunramorlamurla, excerpt from ''One Sage's Wyrmbook''.}}
'''Maskalandur Narlur''' was a sage of the city-state of [[Ormpur]] on the edge of [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faer√ªn]] in the 1360s [[DR]]. He styled himself as "Lorelord of Ormpur".

He made a special study of [[dragon]]s, such as the [[song dragon]] [[Taraunramorlamurla]] who dwelled in [[Waterdeep]]. Narlur could be consulted on draconic matters.

He compiled his work in ''[[One Sage's Wyrmbook]]'', which was published in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]].
