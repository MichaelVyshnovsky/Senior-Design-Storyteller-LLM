He took pleasure from his job and often accepted bribes. Bolver had a sharp wit and a sharper tongue.\nBolver was one of the Black Fist lieutenants in charge of the Stojanow Gate.\nAfter the Vorgansharaxs coup Bolver became one of the Tears of Virulence, maintaining all his power. He was displaced with a patrol to capture Madame Freona but was defeated and killed by an adventuring party hired by the resistance to permit the escape of Freona.\nBolver usually stayed at a desk in the Black Fist barracks to answer to citizens petitions."
