        "mainbody": "ictoria was one of the elven war party leaders of NVaelahr, a covert branch of the AkhVelahr military in the days of the Weeping War.\nVictoria possessed some of the best enchanted equipment of the NVaelahr. Her weapons were the Arrowflight of Angels and the dagger of angels. She wore Victorias boots of beguiling gait, Victorias gloves of electric touch, Victorias leather corset into battle.\nDuring the fateful fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War (711â€“714 DR), Victoria led a band of NVaelahr into the depths of the Elven Catacombs against one of the Dark Generals of the Army of Darkness, the creature known as Drenofiend. However, Victoria and her squad were slaughtered, caught unaware by Greyanna, the youngest daughter of Matron Mother Faeurdyn of the drow House Freth, whod allied themselves with the Army of Darkness against the City of Song.\nIn 1369 DR, Victorias enchanted gear and her diary were looted from the dead by the returned drow of House Freth, who had allied with the enemies of Myth Drannor once again, this time the Cult of the Dragon. Victorias gear was readied for transport into the Underdark by the marauding drow. However, the drow operations were disbanded by the Veiled Ones of Phlan, who once heard Victorias ghostly voice asking them to avenge her death and slay Greyanna Freth."
