        "mainbody": "'''Falstaff''' was a [[doomguide]] who lived in the city of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "He was one a member of the contingent of Kelemvorite forces sent to investigate the [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] in [[Neverwinter]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. He and some of his fellows were lost in an area known as [[the Rift]] after an assault by [[undead]] and their [[Red Wizard]]s masters. Falstaff was killed by a volley of [[arrow]]s. \n\nSome time later [[Volahk|Doomguide Volahk]] hired an adventurer to find his missing comrades in the city's graveyard district. After finding Falstaff's corpse, the adventurer burned it so that it could not be raised as an [[undead]] abomination by the [[Thay]]an [[necromancer]]s."
