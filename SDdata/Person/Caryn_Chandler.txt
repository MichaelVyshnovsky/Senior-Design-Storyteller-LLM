==Description==
Caryn was an older woman with light skin and a bob of white hair, dressed in a white and gray dress with leggings.

==Relationships==
Caryn was the mother of [[Jandove Midler|Jandove]] and [[Graven Chandler|Graven]], and partner of [[Wilaver Chandler|Wilaver]].

==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.

Caryn was kept below the house in its cellar with a group of drow guards and a wizard that kept them magically paralysed, alongside her husband Wilaver and grandson [[Thoben Midler|Thoben]].
