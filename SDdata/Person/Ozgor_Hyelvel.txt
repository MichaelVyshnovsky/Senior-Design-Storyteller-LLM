Ozgor Hyelvel was the Magister from  to .
Ozgor employed a number of black lightning spells, and could cast spells that brought down towers. He also could cast meteor swarm.
Ozgors entire life was akin to a military campaign, where he continuously moved from fight to fight.
At the time he was offered the office of the Magister, Ozgor was in the process of attacking a town (destroyed by the late 14 century DR) in the Vilhon Reach, on behalf of its neighboring towns tyrant. By the turn of that year, Ozgor was slaying his employer at the moment, on behalf of one who had outbid him.
He continued to ravage and pillage as the Magister, building up stores of enchanted wares and weapons to which he returned when in need. However, his caches never contained money, for his campaigns always left him short on those.
Ozgor perished when he assaulted the keep of Velgorn Kataclath and his fellow adventurers. Velgorn employed magic to send a piece of the keep, brought down by Ozgors spell, on a circular trajectory which struck Ozgor from behind while he was busy in a spell duel with him.
