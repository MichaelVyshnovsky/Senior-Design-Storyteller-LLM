        "History": "When Kwilgok was young, he visited the ruins of [[Dangwaru]], and was attacked by the shadows that dwelt there, though he was able to flee in a weakened state.\n\nBy the time he was 26 years old, Kwilgok had traversed the [[River Soshenstar]], been to the [[Aldani Basin]] and its surrounding region, and led expeditions to [[Orolunga]], though he had never encountered the oracle that was supposed to live there.",
        "Possessions": "At some point, Kwilgok acquired a pet [[ankylosaurus]] named [[Deadly Treasure]], which he used as a mount from a howdah on its back."
