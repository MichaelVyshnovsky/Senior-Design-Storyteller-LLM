Lise was a serving girl inhabiting the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Lise worked in the House of Comfort, an inn located near the center of Zhentil Keeps Foreign Quarter on the south bank of the River Tesh. She had to be on the lookout for over-eager customers reaching out to grab her, but the innkeep, Maradad, was usually there to slap their hands away.
