        "mainbody": "'''Phontyr Wonderspell''' was an [[archmage]] who lived in [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] was long deceased by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIt was said that Phontyr knew a [[sorceress]] who was an ally, lifelong friend, and possibly even a lover of his. However, she became [[polymorph]]ed and stuck in the form of a [[unicorn]] forever and Phontyr was unable to free her from magic more powerful than this own. This was but one story given for the mysterious apparition of a unicorn at the place where his house once stood.\n\nAfter Phontyr's death, his house burned down in circumstances considered mysterious. It later became the site of the inn named for him and his friend, [[Phontyr's Unicorn]], by [[1358 DR]]."
