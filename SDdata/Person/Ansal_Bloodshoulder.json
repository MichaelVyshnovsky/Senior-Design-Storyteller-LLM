        "mainbody": "'''Ansal Bloodshoulder''' was the informal leader of [[Thundertree]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Being a local [[ranger]], Ansal guided the woodcutters and directed them to cut down certain trees and plant a sapling in its place to help appease the elves living in [[Neverwinter Wood]]. He also examined the trees for disease or invasive vines that needed burned or cut down. He was a [[Harper]] and one of the few who knew the way through [[Neverwinter Wood]].",
        "History": "At one point in her early life, [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] was gifted an [[enchanted]] [[ring]], a ''[[ring of the wood elves]]'', by Ansal. Some time later, the ring was used by still very young Aribeth to save the village of Thundertree from a power-hungry [[mage]] of [[Luskan]]."
