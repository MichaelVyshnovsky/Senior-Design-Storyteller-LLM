        "mainbody": "Ansal Bloodshoulder was the informal leader of Thundertree in 1370 DR.\nBeing a local ranger, Ansal guided the woodcutters and directed them to cut down certain trees and plant a sapling in its place to help appease the elves living in Neverwinter Wood. He also examined the trees for disease or invasive vines that needed burned or cut down. He was a Harper and one of the few who knew the way through Neverwinter Wood.\nAt one point in her early life, Aribeth de Tylmarande was gifted an enchanted ring, a ring of the wood elves, by Ansal. Some time later, the ring was used by still very young Aribeth to save the village of Thundertree from a power-hungry mage of Luskan."
