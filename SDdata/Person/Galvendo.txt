Galvendo was a hunter of the city of Mirabar who operated a hunting lodge named after himself.
Along with utilizing very aggressive advertising for his lodge, Galvendo claimed that no one had ever died on one of his expeditions. The truth, however, was that three clients had met a grizzly demise while hunting with Galvendo (typically by a bear or winter wolf). These deceased few were then resurrected by Galvendos companion Deathcalm the Loved by means of a raise dead spell.
