His sisters were Sybille Rhindaun and Cyriana Rhindaun. As was the tradition in Tethyr for princes and princesses, the first son always shared the first name of his father as his second name.\nVander Stillhawk was the boys regent and ruled the Iltkazar Highlands in his place. Vander was very protective of Coram.\nLater in life, Coram would have a daughter, Jemra Rhindaun, who would marry into the Obarskyr royal family of Cormyr.\nCoram and his two sisters were born in Flamerule of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. This was the first time there had been royal triplets in Tethyr since the reign of Queen Alisande Bormul in 832 DR.\nWithin two months, the Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal sent word to Tethyr offering a marriage proposal between Coram and el Pesarkhals granddaughter Sarya el Thamal. It is not recorded how Tethyr responded.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Tethyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerntarn\nCategoryInhabitants of Ithal Crag\nCategoryInhabitants of Darromar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Crown Lands\nCategoryInhabitants of the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryPrinces and princesses\ngc52zuzw1imkc3ujftzbd199eklu0lf"
