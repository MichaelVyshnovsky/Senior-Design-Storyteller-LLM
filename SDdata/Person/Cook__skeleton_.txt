The creature only known as '''Cook''' was a [[skeleton]] what haunted the infamous [[Haunted Halls]] near the village of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In the 15{{th}} century DR, Cook could be found within the dungeon, still wieilding the the toll of the trade â€“ a massive [[skillet]], as a weapon. It was easily identified by the bleached bones and a dark blue bandana. The skeleton still haunted the dungeon when a group of adventurers that arrived to [[Toril]] through a rift from [[Eberron]] descended into the Haunted Halls.
