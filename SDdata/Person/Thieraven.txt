Kithlord '''Thieraven''' was a [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] [[sorcerer]] of the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime in the early 1370s DR, Thieraven came into contact with the [[Shar]]ran priestess [[Esvele Greycastle]], seeking aid in breaking his people's shadow curse. She wrote him back a letter, claiming that the goddess Shar could not break the bargain that led to the curse. However, she promised that if he and his shadar-kai aided in her scheme, then they would have a secret realm in the [[Vast Swamp]] where they would be immune to the curse, with other sites planned in the future. She urged him to recruit other shadar-kai to the effort.

By the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Thieraven had been sent by Esvele to the [[Lost Refuge]] in the Vast Swamp to help the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]] in his plot to tear apart the [[Weave]] of [[magic]]. Thieraven reopened the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] to the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]], where the scheme was enacted. He also had the knowledge of subduing the [[zombie]] [[dragon turtle]] at [[Black Tree Bend]].
