        "mainbody": "'''Mig''' was an [[ogre]]ss follower of [[the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Absolute... is god-meat? Mig join up for food. If god is made of meat... it all make sense now. Praise Absolute!''|Mig}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Mig was among those who joined the new religions that sprang in the [[Western Heartlands]]. The ogress joined after being promised food – meat. She was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Mig was seemingly the only cultist who paid attention to moving sounds all throughout the towers. These sounds came from the colossal spread of the [[Netherbrain]]'s tentacles deep in the walls of the Moonrise – the true identity of the Absolute. Slithering sounds of the Absolute made Mig hungry.\n\nAccording to some, Mig may had been slain during the True Soul heroes and [[Harper]] attack on the Moonrise Towers that ended Ketheric Thorm's [[undead]] existence."
