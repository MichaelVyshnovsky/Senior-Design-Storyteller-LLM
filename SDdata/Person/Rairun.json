        "Activities": "Rairun wandered the [[Inner Sea]] area trying to protect forested land from [[human]] activities, working with [[elves]] in the [[Dalelands]], with the priests of [[Chauntea]] in [[Voonlar]] and [[Sembia]], and with druids all around the area. His best idea was to plant trees like farmers planted grain and vegetable crops; this idea was used in some Dales and in the north of Sembia.",
        "Relationship": "Rairun had a feud with the [[satyr]]s of the area. He had tutored most of the druids of the area."
