Vaermaer was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the Copper Coronet in the River District of Athkatla, in the late 14 century DR.
Vaermaer was a giant muscled and balding man who worked wearing his breastplate, greaves, and armored codpiece. He wore many earrings. Judging by his posturing and physique, Vaermaer was a seasoned fighter. His professional surliness veiled Vaermaers true personality.
By the late 14 century DR, Vaermaer was an established member of the Copper Coronets staff. He, along with Bordovan, Delric, and Othlo, was supervised by Old Sarvo Droostan, the Coronets tavernmaster. Vaermaer worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. Vaermaer and the rest of the mountainous bartenders kept large human fist-sized rocks behind the Copper Coronets bar stand. These rocks were used as projectiles, tossed around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Vaermaers attitude changed to that of a glacier when an obviously rich visitor arrived a the Coronet or one of Athkatlas officials. He did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronets female employees.
