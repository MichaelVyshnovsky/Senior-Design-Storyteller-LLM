'''Dragomir the Red''' was a power-hungry [[vampire]] warlord who commanded armies both in life and during [[undeath]].

==Description==
He was known to command both admiration and fright from his followers.

==Possessions==
After Dragomir was turned, he commissioned the [[necromancer]] [[Zulann Flass]] to craft him a ''[[Cloak of Dragomir|magical cloak]]'' that allowed him to travel outside during the daylight hours.

He kept his coffin within a ''[[Dragomir's Respite|unique bag of holding]]'' that he entrusted to his most loyal of knights. Whenever he was slain in battle he merely turned into a gaseous form and need to travel to his resting place to regenerate. By keeping it nearby in the possession of an ally, that distance was greatly reduced.

==Activities==
Dragomir nearly always fought in the front lines of the military campaigns he led.

==History==
While Dragomir's followers were loyal to him for quite some time, they began to see that his voracious desire for power would lead to their doom. Some of his most-trusted devotees commission the creation of the ''[[Casque of Imprisonment]]'', a crown of sorts that would stun and immobilize the wearer. They interred Dragomir within a crypt beneath the [[Athkatla/Grave District|graveyard]] of [[Athkatla]], where he remained for years to follow.

Some time during the 12{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[thief]] by the name of [[Hexxat]] was tasked with recovering the casque for their [[Larloch|patron]]. When she removed it from his head, Dragomir awoke and turned Hexxat into a vampire her self. He then imprisoned her within a nearby stone coffin where she stayed for over two hundred years.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]] assisted a woman named [[Clara]] with the task of entering into Dragomir's tomb. The pair were both manipulated into slaying Dragomir for good, and freeing Hexxat from her imprisonment.
