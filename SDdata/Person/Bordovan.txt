'''Bordovan''' was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the [[Copper Coronet]] in the [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] of [[Athkatla]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bordovan was built like a wall of muscles. He was a balding man wearing a number of jingling earrings who worked wearing his [[breastplate]], [[greaves]], and armored [[codpiece]]. Judging by his posturing and physique, Bordovan was a steeled warrior. When at the Coronet, Bordovan showed little friendliness to the tavern's customers, keeping stoic professional attitude.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Bordovan was an established member of the Copper Coronet's staff. He, along with [[Vaermaer]], [[Delric]], and [[Othlo]], was supervised by Old [[Sarvo Droostan]], the Coronet's tavernmaster. Bordovan worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. Bordovan and the rest of the mountainous bouncer-bartenders kept large rocks behind the bar. These rocks were used as projectiles, thrown around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Bordovan's attitude changed to that of a glacier when an obviously rich visitor entered the Coronet or one of Athkatla's officials arrived. Bordovan and his fellow bartenders did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronet's female employees.
