She was an [[adventurer]].\n\nIn [[Nightal]] of [[1357 DR|the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], she made a triumphant return to [[The Drunken Dragon]], favorite [[tavern]] in Tsurlagol, and there displayed a selection of curious [[harp]]s and beautiful, [[magic]]al [[blade]]s. According to her, she had explored the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], battled [[devil]]s, and pulled the treasures from their claws.\n\n[[Maerhult]], a [[bard]] also visiting the tavern, examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor, and to be rare magical items.",
