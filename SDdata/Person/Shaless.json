She was an adventurer.\nIn Nightal of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, she made a triumphant return to The Drunken Dragon, favorite tavern in Tsurlagol, and there displayed a selection of curious harps and beautiful, magical blades. According to her, she had explored the ruins of Myth Drannor, battled devils, and pulled the treasures from their claws.\nMaerhult, a bard also visiting the tavern, examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor, and to be rare magical items.\nCategoryAdventurers\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Tsurlagol\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nkxx7n88viac6xn5bg3rp8jjduutdyc3"
