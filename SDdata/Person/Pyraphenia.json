        "mainbody": "'''Pyraphenia the Firebrand''' was a mercenary and the main lieutenant of [[Gommoth|Gommoth the Twisted]], the cult-leader that took control of [[Mount Hotenow]] for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Unlike fervent members of Gommoth's [[Cult of Maegera]], Pyraphenia was not invested nor did she believe in the goal to reawaken the sleeping fire [[primordial]] [[Maegera]]. Rather she was a pragmatist that saw the rise of the [[fire giant]] faction as a great opportunity to hone her skills as a swordswoman.\n\nMuch to her chagrin, Pyraphenia was relegated to guarding the [[red dragon]] [[Karrundax]], and forced to remain within [[Caverns of Karrundax|its lair]] in Mount Hotenow, rather than fight in battle.",
        "History": "Pyraphenia finally got her chance to test her combat prowess against worthy combatants in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, when the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] assaulted the cult's holdings in Mount Hotenow. Ultimately her abilities and expertise were not as good the warrior believed, and she fell to the group while defending the young Karrundax and her [[wyrmling]]s."
