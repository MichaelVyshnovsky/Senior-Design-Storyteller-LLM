        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], they went to [[Mulmaster]] with the intention of exploring some dwarven ruins in the [[Earthspur Mountains]], but the city watch sergeant, [[Audra Maskyr]], hired them to explore the city's sewers instead. During the exploration, they fought some large [[rat]]s and lost Rorik Ironheart in a flood. At this point, Nualion and the others met another adventuring party sent by sergeant Maskyr, and, with their help, Nualion and his companions exited from the sewers.{{Cite adventurers league/Foulness Beneath Mulmaster|9}}"
