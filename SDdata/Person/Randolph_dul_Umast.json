        "mainbody": "Randolph dul Umast was a human priest of Tymora and the high priest at The Ladys Favor temple in the hamlet of Sevenecho in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nWhen the temple of The Ladys Favor was built in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Randolph dul Umast was appointed its first high priest He demonstrated himself to be a wise and capable leader of the local priesthood.\nAround Kythorn of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, a convoy secretly transported the torque of faith, a holy item of Tymora, to The Ladys Favor. However, the Vipers gang of bandits attacked the convoy, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. The Tymorans in Procampur were outraged and Randolph hired the ranger Dura Gerathu to locate the Vipers Nest.\nOn Eleint 1 in 1369 DR, one of the hamlets wells was poisoned, killing a few villagers and sickening twenty-two more. The priests of Tymora treated them but found that their magic could do nothing to identify or cure the poison, and they were forced to rely on non-magical treatments. Randolph communed with Tymora for advice and then sought adventurers to seek the poisons ingredients or a cure, and return the torque of faith if they should find it.As \"Into the Nest of Vipers\" is an adventure module, its conclusion is officially unresolved. Successful completion would see the PCs return with the antidote and the torque.\nRandolph was a priest of Tymora.\nRandolph dul Umast was quite an elderly man, made tiny with age, stooping at only 5 feet and 2 inches (1.6 meters) tall and weighing 120 pounds (55 kilograms). He was nearly completely bald, left with only a few strands of white hair, and clean-shaven. Though his eyes were once bright blue, they faded until they were almost colorless.\nIn combat, Randolph wore chainmail and fought with a strongly magical footmans mace and medium-sized shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of Tymora. At the temple, he wore a golden robe."
