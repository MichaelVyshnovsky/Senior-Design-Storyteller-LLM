'''Piyrathur''' was a caravan master from [[Iriaebor]] and a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Piyrathur was one of the few Knights operating in the [[Caravan Cities]]. He was an able caravan master with investments in [[Sembia]] and [[Westgate]], controlling most of the Knights' business around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Strangely for someone with no magical power, he was a devoted follower of [[Mystra]], donating much money and [[magical item]]s to the [[Church of Mystra]]. Piyrathur's main concern was thwarting the plots of the [[Men of the Basilisk]]
