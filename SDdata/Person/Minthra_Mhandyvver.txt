Minthra Mhandyvver, usually known as Minny, was a shopkeeper in Red Larch during the Elemental Evil crisis of 1491 DR.
Minny had the demeanor of a kindly, old dodderer, but she was very sharp. She, among other things, knew the identities of most of the Believers members but believed them harmless.
Minny managed a poultry shop with her three grown children in the village.
In 1491, Minny was worried for her adventurous young granddaughter, Pell Mhandyvver, who had had an unpleasant adventure in the Haunted Tomb.
