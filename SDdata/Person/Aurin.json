        "mainbody": "'''Aurin''', better known as '''Aurin the Generous''', was a businessman and accomplished [[conjurer]] who lived in [[Skullport]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Aurin never spoke about his past. Aside from this, he was a typical [[wizard]]: moody, secretive, and suspicious.",
        "Possessions": "Aurin always kept a supply of [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s on hand. He wielded a ''[[staff of power]]'' and wore both a ''[[ring of protection]]'' and ''[[bracers of defense]]'' as well as a ''[[cloak of protection]]'' over his ''[[robe of blending]]''.\n\nHe also possessed a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'', which allowed him to summon a [[giant owl]] that he used to travel swiftly and silently around Skullport.",
        "Activities": "Aurin and his three partners&mdash;[[Ithvar Wordkiller]], [[Ysele|Ysele the Cat]], and [[Chantos Graybeard]]&mdash;managed [[Hired Horrors]], a business of breeding and selling [[deepspawn]], usually for dungeons.",
        "Relationships": "Of his three business partners, Aurin despised Ithvar and did not trust Ysele. However, Chantos was his best friend.",
        "History": "Aurin hailed from a country north of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] near the [[Earthspur Mountains]] (likely [[Damara]] or [[Impiltur]]).\n\nPrior to [[1350 DR]], he was forced out of his home, and after a series of adventures in which he acquired a pair of juvenile deepspawn, he eventually arrived in Skullport where he met up with his old friend Chantos Graybeard. The two of them, along with Ysele the Cat and Lord Ithvar Wordkiller, created their breeding business, Hired Horrors. Aurin assumed the leadership role, although the jealous Ithvar&mdash;believing himself to be entitled to leadership as he was the largest investor&mdash;challenged him to a magic duel. Despite agreeing to use nonlethal magics, Ithvar attempted to annihilate Aurin with a ''[[fireball]]''. However, Aurin won the duel, and also saved the life of his opponent, gaining the nickname of \"Aurin the Generous\".\n\nAround [[1370 DR]], he became the target of a series of assassination attempts. He believed that these were sent by one of his business associates, possibly Lord Ithvar."
