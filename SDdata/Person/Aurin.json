        "mainbody": "Aurin, better known as Aurin the Generous, was a businessman and accomplished conjurer who lived in Skullport in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAurin never spoke about his past. Aside from this, he was a typical wizard moody, secretive, and suspicious.\nAurin always kept a supply of scrolls and potions on hand. He wielded a staff of power and wore both a ring of protection and bracers of defense as well as a cloak of protection over his robe of blending.\nHe also possessed a figurine of wondrous power, which allowed him to summon a giant owl that he used to travel swiftly and silently around Skullport.\nAurin and his three partners&mdashIthvar Wordkiller, Ysele the Cat, and Chantos Graybeard&mdashmanaged Hired Horrors, a business of breeding and selling deepspawn, usually for dungeons.\nOf his three business partners, Aurin despised Ithvar and did not trust Ysele. However, Chantos was his best friend.\nAurin hailed from a country north of the Sea of Fallen Stars near the Earthspur Mountains (likely Damara or Impiltur).\nPrior to 1350 DR, he was forced out of his home, and after a series of adventures in which he acquired a pair of juvenile deepspawn, he eventually arrived in Skullport where he met up with his old friend Chantos Graybeard. The two of them, along with Ysele the Cat and Lord Ithvar Wordkiller, created their breeding business, Hired Horrors. Aurin assumed the leadership role, although the jealous Ithvar&mdashbelieving himself to be entitled to leadership as he was the largest investor&mdashchallenged him to a magic duel. Despite agreeing to use nonlethal magics, Ithvar attempted to annihilate Aurin with a fireball. However, Aurin won the duel, and also saved the life of his opponent, gaining the nickname of \"Aurin the Generous\".\nAround 1370 DR, he became the target of a series of assassination attempts. He believed that these were sent by one of his business associates, possibly Lord Ithvar."
