'''Nelvon deJun''' ({{Pronounce|NAY|lawn|_|duh|SHOON|refs={{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|40}}}}) was a member of the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]] in [[Mulmaster]].

==Personality==
Nelvon truly believed in the righteousness of the Cloaks. He was also ambitious. He genuinely cared about his younger brother Larch. Nelvon felt that as older brother his responsibility was to protect Larch, even if he did not like his lifestyle.

==History==
Nelvon was a promising member of the Cloaks. He led the testing of [[Maude Kron]], who showed an innate affinity for magic and was thus required to undergo training with the Cloaks. Maude's refusal to join the Cloaks led to her being exiled from Mulmaster and ultimately killed by bandits.

In [[1491 DR]], Maude's family planned revenge against Nelvon. With the assistance of [[Proskler]], an acolyte of [[Talos]], they devised a plot to kidnap and murder [[Larch deJun]], to get back at Nelvon.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|7-8}} They acted at a great party held in [[Astrid Saj]]'s villa, but Nelvon hired an adventuring party that happened to be present and they eventually saved Larch.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|11}}
