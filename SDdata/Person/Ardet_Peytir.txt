Ardet Peytir was a young socialite in Mulmaster. 
In 1491 DR, Ardet was one of the main opponents of the Liberators led by Aleyd Burral, saying that Mulmaster did not need a war against Phlan and could use those men in better ways. For this he was kidnapped, and his mansion was destroyed by Aleyd and her brother Wylan Burral, who was secretly a member of the Cult of the Black Earth. He was eventually saved by an adventuring party hired by his cousin, Blade Cora Peytir, when she uncovered the truth and defeated Wylan and his minions.
Ardet usually did nothing, instead existing on the money inherited from his dead father. He was a famous party habitu√©. 
Ardet was the cousin of Blade Cora Peytir and Fedosia Peytir.
