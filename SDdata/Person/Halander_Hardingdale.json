However before leaving his hideaway in the [[Undercellar]] of Baldur's Gate, he stole a magic pouch from the kingpin known as the [[Fetcher]].\n\nReuniting his family in Waterdeep, Ratshadow joined the Zhentarim as a front man. They felt his skill at making contacts could be used elsewhere and sent him North to Ten Towns to help establish the Black Network as a regional power.",
