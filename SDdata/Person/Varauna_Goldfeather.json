        "mainbody": "'''Varauna Goldfeather''' was a member of the [[Goldfeather]] noble family of [[Cormyr]] and a lady-in-waiting and friend of [[Raedra Obarskyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Varauna was lady-in-waiting to the then princess, Raedra Obarskyr, as of [[Kythorn 26]], the {{YearlinkName|1486}}. She was amongst Raedra's retinue that occasionally engaged in fencing and archery contests. While she was not the originator of such rumors, Varauna repeated salacious rumors concerning Raedra. \n\nVarauna met [[Farideh]] while the latter was in disguise, where she badmouthed Farideh's twin sister, [[Havilar]]. Raedra Obarskyr had been informed that one of her ladies-in-waiting was an agent of [[Shar]], which proved to be Sulue Thundersword. Varauna acted diffidently during her own inspection by [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] Ilstan Nyaril.\n\nVarauna helped Raedra Obarskyr slip out during the [[shadovar's siege of Suzail]] by staging a fight with Florelle Ambershield. Varauna flashed a smile to her mother during the siege. Afterwards, around [[Nightal 5]], 1486 DR, she was seen fighting in the war against the shadovar. In one such incident, she shot an arrow into a [[shade]]'s eyes as it tried to enter the gatehouse.",
        "Personality": "Varauna had a rather prickly personality, especially towards those she did not consider to be an ally. Once made into a friend, Raedra considered Varauna to be anyone's worthwhile ally. Varauna often engaged in gossip, even if it concerned her friends. Varauna badmouthed Havilar's looks, at least in part by bringing to light her [[tiefling]] heritage. However, this likely stemmed from her seeking attention or wishing to lift [[Raedra]]'s spirits. When meeting Havilar during the shadovar's siege of Suzail, she did not display any overt signs of prejudice.\n\nVarauna was proud and confident by nature.",
        "Abilities": "Varauna was highly skilled with a [[longbow]], and was considered almost as good as [[Baerovus Obarskyr (prince)|Prince Baerovus Obarskyr]]. She performed better than her brother, Maranth, a friendly archery contest.\n\nShe also had a reasonable degree of martial prowess, given her attendance in the friendly fencing contest, donning of [[leather armor]], and fighting to fend off the [[shadovar]].\n\nVarauna possessed considerable wit, an ear for gossip, and a general ability to snap back with witty retorts.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Family": "Varauna had a pleasant relationship with her brother, [[Maranth Goldfeather]], though it did frequently devolve into playful teasing (much like several of her other relationships). She did not criticize Maranth's pursuit of male partners.\n\nVarauna was of the same house as the Dowager Queen, [[Ospra Goldfeather]]. Varauna was respectful and curtsied when meeting the Dowager Queen during the shadovar's siege of Suzail.",
            "Cormyrean Royalty": "Varauna served as Raedra's lady-in-waiting and, at least to a good extent, close friend and confidant. Varauna once repeated lascivious rumors about Raedra that suggested Raedra and her betrothed, [[Aubrin Crownsilver]], were 'sharing' the latter's rumored tiefling mistress, Havilar. However, this did not bother Raedra terribly. She was trusted by Raedra enough to create a diversion, allowing Raedra to slip out. Shortly thereafter, Varauna said that she considered Raedra Obarskyr to be her best friend.\n\nRaedra Obarskyr had suggested Varauna to Baerovus as a potential partner, which he rejected as he felt she teased him far too much.",
            "Cormyrean Nobility": "[[Florelle Ambershield]] was Varauna's fellow lady-in-waiting to Raedra. Varauna fought with [[Pelarra Huntsilver]], when Pelarra was being \"an absolute beast\" towards Florelle ''circa'' [[1483 DR]]. Pelarra was the head of her house as of at least 1486 DR.\n\nVarauna considered Pelarra Huntsilver a \"viper\" and had torn off her hair in the above-mentioned incident. Florelle, Varauna, and Pelarra refused to be in the same room together after the fight.\n\n[[Sulue Thundersword]] was Varauna's fellow lady-in-waiting to Raedra, prior to her discovery as an agent of Shar.",
            "Others": "[[Ilstan Nyaril]] would often accompany [[Raedra Obarskyr]]'s retinue prior to his falling out of favor. The last time they spoke to one another, he implored Varauna to arrange him a meeting with Raedra, which she refused curtly."
