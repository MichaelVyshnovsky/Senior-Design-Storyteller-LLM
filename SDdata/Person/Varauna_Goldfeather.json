        "mainbody": "Varauna Goldfeather was a member of the Goldfeather noble family of Cormyr and a lady-in-waiting and friend of Raedra Obarskyr in the late 15 century DR.\nVarauna was lady-in-waiting to the then princess, Raedra Obarskyr, as of Kythorn 26, the . She was amongst Raedras retinue that occasionally engaged in fencing and archery contests. While she was not the originator of such rumors, Varauna repeated salacious rumors concerning Raedra. \nVarauna met Farideh while the latter was in disguise, where she badmouthed Faridehs twin sister, Havilar. Raedra Obarskyr had been informed that one of her ladies-in-waiting was an agent of Shar, which proved to be Sulue Thundersword. Varauna acted diffidently during her own inspection by War Wizard Ilstan Nyaril.\nVarauna helped Raedra Obarskyr slip out during the shadovars siege of Suzail by staging a fight with Florelle Ambershield. Varauna flashed a smile to her mother during the siege. Afterwards, around Nightal 5, 1486 DR, she was seen fighting in the war against the shadovar. In one such incident, she shot an arrow into a shades eyes as it tried to enter the gatehouse.\nVarauna had a rather prickly personality, especially towards those she did not consider to be an ally. Once made into a friend, Raedra considered Varauna to be anyones worthwhile ally. Varauna often engaged in gossip, even if it concerned her friends. Varauna badmouthed Havilars looks, at least in part by bringing to light her tiefling heritage. However, this likely stemmed from her seeking attention or wishing to lift Raedras spirits. When meeting Havilar during the shadovars siege of Suzail, she did not display any overt signs of prejudice.\nVarauna was proud and confident by nature.\nVarauna was highly skilled with a longbow, and was considered almost as good as Prince Baerovus Obarskyr. She performed better than her brother, Maranth, a friendly archery contest.\nShe also had a reasonable degree of martial prowess, given her attendance in the friendly fencing contest, donning of leather armor, and fighting to fend off the shadovar.\nVarauna possessed considerable wit, an ear for gossip, and a general ability to snap back with witty retorts.\nVarauna had a pleasant relationship with her brother, Maranth Goldfeather, though it did frequently devolve into playful teasing (much like several of her other relationships). She did not criticize Maranths pursuit of male partners.\nVarauna was of the same house as the Dowager Queen, Ospra Goldfeather. Varauna was respectful and curtsied when meeting the Dowager Queen during the shadovars siege of Suzail. \nVarauna served as Raedras lady-in-waiting and, at least to a good extent, close friend and confidant. Varauna once repeated lascivious rumors about Raedra that suggested Raedra and her betrothed, Aubrin Crownsilver, were sharing the latters rumored tiefling mistress, Havilar. However, this did not bother Raedra terribly. She was trusted by Raedra enough to create a diversion, allowing Raedra to slip out. Shortly thereafter, Varauna said that she considered Raedra Obarskyr to be her best friend.\nRaedra Obarskyr had suggested Varauna to Baerovus as a potential partner, which he rejected as he felt she teased him far too much.\nFlorelle Ambershield was Varaunas fellow lady-in-waiting to Raedra. Varauna fought with Pelarra Huntsilver, when Pelarra was being \"an absolute beast\" towards Florelle circa 1483 DR. Pelarra was the head of her house as of at least 1486 DR.\nVarauna considered Pelarra Huntsilver a \"viper\" and had torn off her hair in the above-mentioned incident. Florelle, Varauna, and Pelarra refused to be in the same room together after the fight.\nSulue Thundersword was Varaunas fellow lady-in-waiting to Raedra, prior to her discovery as an agent of Shar. \nIlstan Nyaril would often accompany Raedra Obarskyrs retinue prior to his falling out of favor. The last time they spoke to one another, he implored Varauna to arrange him a meeting with Raedra, which she refused curtly."
