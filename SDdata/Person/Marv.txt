'''Marv''' was a [[human]] bouncer who kept peace at the [[Black Eye]] tavern and [[festhall]] in the city of [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Behave yourself and there won't be any trouble.''|Marv}}

==Description==
Marv was a giant of a man with short chestnut-colored hair. He was {{SI|6'6|'"|long=yes}} tall and was built like an [[ox]]. However, he was overshadowed by his truly massive brother and fellow bouncer, [[Gregory]], and the tavern's proprietor, another hulking brother, named [[Little Davey]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Marv's favorite entertainer who worked at the Black Eye, [[Dimples]] the Dancer, disappeared and stopped showing up for work. In reality, "Dimples" was a member of Westgate's City Guard and she danced for patrons of the festhall as a hobby. She twisted her ankle in the line of duty and simply wasn't able to perform until she was healed.
