        "mainbody": "Setana was a watchghost barmaid in Skullport.\nAround 1370 DR, Setana worked as a barmaid for Gallowshawk, earning some notoriety for the inn. Secretly, she was also a Harper agent. She was bound to a golden hair comb. A very frequent guest was the unusual mind flayer Sangalor.\nIn life, Setana was very devoted to her mistress, who gave her the comb. When Setana died at sea, she had with her the comb, which was later recovered by an aquatic elf, who traded it to the captain of the ill-fated ship on which Gallowshawk had worked. The comb was the only piece that he had not sold over the years."
