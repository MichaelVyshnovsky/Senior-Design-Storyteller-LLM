        "mainbody": "'''Setana''' was a [[watchghost]] barmaid in [[Skullport]].",
        "Activities": "Around [[1370 DR]], Setana worked as a barmaid for [[Gallowshawk]], earning some notoriety for the inn. Secretly, she was also a [[Harper]] agent. She was bound to a golden hair comb. A very frequent guest was the unusual [[mind flayer]] [[Sangalor]].",
        "History": "In life, Setana was very devoted to her mistress, who gave her the comb. When Setana died at sea, she had with her the comb, which was later recovered by an [[aquatic elf]], who traded it to the captain of the ill-fated ship on which Gallowshawk had worked. The comb was the only piece that he had not sold over the years."
