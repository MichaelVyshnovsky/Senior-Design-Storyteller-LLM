Thoalur Harbright was one of the proprietors of the Roaring Dragon House, a newly opened gambling hall and tavern just outside Waterdeep, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Thoalur learned the basics of being a warrior, but most of his time was spent managing the Roaring Dragon House, taking turns as shift supervisor with this sister Brarindra. They were occasionally given a reprieve by other members of the Harbrights. On his shifts, he was in charge of a company of over forty mercenary guards plus dozens of servers, escorts, coin keepers (folks who ran the games), tellers, and stablehands.
Thoalur was the nephew of Drengar Harbright, proprietor of the High Flagon inn and gambling hall for the Harbright family that was located just up the road. Drengar and the family commissioned the Roaring Dragon to be built and he put Thoalur and Brarindra in charge of day-to-day operations.
