Alaurum was a powerful archmage of the world of Toril and one of three persons responsible for creating the World Serpent Inn, according to the wizard Elminster.
Very little is known about Alaurum&mdashnot even race or gender are known&mdashexcept that the mage was friends with a member of the Arcane named Ilyndele. The two, together with the illithid High One Sharth, are said to have "crafted" the inter-planar inn.
Hundreds of years before the late 14 century DR, Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The demiplane within which the inn resided&mdashand the planes many portals&mdashhad already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a dreamscape resulting from a sleeping fragment of the World Serpent.
