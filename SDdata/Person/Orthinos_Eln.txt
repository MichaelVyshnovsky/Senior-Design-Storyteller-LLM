Orthinos Eln was a shadovar priest of Shar active in the late 15 century DR.
Orthinos was a shade. His preferred means of attack was to fire a beam of necromantic energy at his foes.
Orthinos ran the Cathedral of Night in the ruined enclave of Xinlenal, and spent a fair amount of his time in prayer.
As of the , he was tasked by Prince Clariburnus Tanthul to oversee the excavation of the enclave, and he managed the logistics of supplies arriving at the worksite from the Shadowfell via a portal in his shrine.
Orthinos served Clariburnus Tanthul&mdashone of the twelve Princes of Shade&mdashand regularly communed with him.
When Prince Clariburnus recruited the Ashmadai as servants, Orthinos suspected but could not prove that the cultists had their own agenda that did not align with that of the Shadovar.
In 1479 DR, Orthinos sent his personal spies to Neverwinter to keep an eye on the Ashmadai without informing his Prince about this decision.
