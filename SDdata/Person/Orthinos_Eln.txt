'''Orthinos Eln''' was a [[shadovar]] [[priest]] of [[Shar]] active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Orthinos was a [[shade]]. His preferred means of attack was to fire a beam of [[necromantic]] energy at his foes.

==Activities==
Orthinos ran the [[Cathedral of Night]] in the ruined [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Xinlenal]], and spent a fair amount of his time in prayer.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, he was tasked by Prince [[Clariburnus Tanthul]] to oversee the excavation of the enclave, and he managed the logistics of supplies arriving at the worksite from the [[Shadowfell]] via a ''[[portal]]'' in his shrine.

==Relationships==
Orthinos served Clariburnus Tanthul&mdash;one of the twelve [[Princes of Shade]]&mdash;and regularly communed with him.

When Prince Clariburnus recruited the [[Ashmadai]] as servants, Orthinos suspected but could not prove that the cultists had their own agenda that did not align with that of the Shadovar.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Orthinos sent his personal spies to [[Neverwinter]] to keep an eye on the Ashmadai without informing his Prince about this decision.
