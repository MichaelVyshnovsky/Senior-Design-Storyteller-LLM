        "Description": "Meats was a mountainous grey-skinned [[half-orc]] with long wavy lush hair. He was dressed in a simple [[breastplate]] atop bright green cloth, and carried a massive two-handed [[axe]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jezzy worked as a muscle for a gruff [[hin]] smuggler named [[Big Huido]], transporting [[weapon]]s, [[drug]]s, and [[firewine]] into Baldur's Gate. The shipments were well defended by Galem and the rest of the crew – all were released into the hands of the members of the Guild only. One such shipment during the [[Absolute crisis]] was a chest containing [[essence of ether]], [[dream mist]], [[silkroot]], and [[terazul]] – all illegal substances in the city."
