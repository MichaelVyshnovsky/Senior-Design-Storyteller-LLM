        "mainbody": "General '''Ketheric Thorm''' was a [[Chosen]] of [[Myrkul]] and a leader of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] who led an army of undead and monstrous creatures from [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He played a significant role in the [[Absolute crisis|Absolute Crisis]] that plagued the [[Sword Coast]] during that time.\n\n{{Quote|I'll tell you a story, True Soul, about a man who sold himself piece by piece. He had...everything...|Ketheric Thorm.}}",
        "Description": "Like most [[half-elves]], Ketheric still showed signs of aging in his latter years. He had long gray hair that he wore over a circlet bearing the symbol of [[the Absolute]].",
        "Personality": "Ketheric was a devoted family man in his mortal life. After losing them, he became utterly distraught and lost all semblance of his former self. His despair drove him to desperation, and in turn obsession. In his final years he became wholly devoted to getting back his family, keeping them safe, even if it was against their will.",
        "Activities": "Before his conversion to the [[Church of Myrkul]], Ketheric was former [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] and later a worshipper of the goddess [[Shar]].",
        "Relationships": "Ketheric had a wife named [[Melodia Thorm|Melodia]] and a daughter named [[Isobel Thorm|Isobel]], whom he loved more than anything else in life. Isobel challenged her father, but brought him such joy he could never despair despite the loss he suffered. In time, Isobel fell in love with [[Aylin]], a divine daughter of the Moonmaiden [[Selûne]]. Unfortunately, both Ketheric's wife and Isobel died, the latter death especially bringing Ketheric tremendous grief that drove him to pledge himself to Shar for erasing his sorrow first, then Myrkul in exchange for her resurrection.\n\nThree other individuals with the surname Thorm were encountered by adventurers within the shadow-cursed lands surrounding Reithwin: [[Malus Thorm]], Ketheric's physician uncle; [[Gerringothe Thorm]], the toll collector; and [[Thisobald Thorm]], the brewer who states that he is Ketheric Thorm's son. As a product of the shadow curse, each of them had become horrifically twisted in some way and driven to madness.  \n\nThe [[necromancer]] [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]] served as the general's trusted advisor and ally in all matters in service to Myrkul.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|That is the power my Lord Myrkul has granted me - command over the immeasurable legions of the dead.|Ketheric Thorm.}}\nIn his time in service to the Absolute, Ketheric was granted invulnerability by profane magic that involved binding a celestial being within a 'soulcage' in the [[Shadowfell]], accessible from a portal within the [[Gauntlet of Shar]]. The power of the celestial being was siphoned away by [[necromantic]] magic, and bestowed  Ketheric everlasting life and immortal strength. Ketheric was able to survive injuries that would instantly kill a mortal, such as an arrow through the eye or an axe through the chest, and heal his wounds nearly instantly. However, the trapped celestial was in fact the [[aasimar]] [[Aylin|Dame Aylin]], Isobel Thorm's one true love. Isobel hated her father for imprisoning Aylin, and for manipulating her in such a twisted manner.",
        "Possessions": "Ketheric Thorm wore a suit of [[plate armor]] known as the ''[[Reaper's Embrace]]'', and wielded a unique ''[[Ketheric's warhammer|warhammer]]'' and ''[[Ketheric's shield|shield]]''.\n\nHe was also in possession of one of the three ''[[netherstone]]s'', powerful [[Netherese]] artifacts associated with the once-god [[Karsus]].",
        "History": "{{Quote|I have fought great wars before, in the service of other gods, and other powers. But for Myrkul, I would condemn all of Faerûn to death.|Ketheric Thorm.}}\n[[File:Younger Ketheric Thorm bust.png|thumb|right|250px|''A bust depicting a younger Ketheric, in the possession of his daughter Isobel within [[Last Light Inn]].'']]\nIn his first life, Ketheric Thorm was a worshiper of Selûne, his family having been faithful servants of the Moonmaiden for generations. His family lived in Moonrise Towers, the ancestral Thorm holding, as well as the surrounding town of [[Reithwin]]. Ketheric's wife Melodia died while still young, and although he grieved, he continued to care for his daughter Isobel. Unfortunately, Isobel also died young, leading Ketheric to grieve her death deeply. To take away his sorrow, Ketheric turned to [[Shar]], the Lady of Loss. He eventually became Shar's chosen. \n\nSometime before the {{Yearlink|1373}},{{Thorm-time}} Ketheric raised an army of [[Dark Justiciars]] beneath the Thorm family mausoleum. He and his followers started to conquer the lands surrounding Moonrise Towers in Shar's name. Eventually, Ketheric and his army were driven back by an allied force of [[Harpers]] commanded by [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]], and [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Grove]]. Notable among those who opposed him were the hero [[Jaheira]] and the Master Druid [[Halsin]]. A battle raged outside of the Moonrise, and the losses on both sides were massive. Unwilling to see further bloodshed, Khelben Arunsun, on behalf of the [[High Harper Council]] and its allies, sent a letter of surrender to the warlord. It was met with refusal and slaughter, yet the alliance defeated General Thorm and his Dark Justiciars. However, the warlord conjured a deadly Sharran curse before drawing the last breath of his first life. He was buried in the Thorm family mausoleum by Jaheira and Harper survivors. Soon after, the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|shadow curse]] spilled out of the mausoleum and consumed the land for over a century afterward.\n\nSome time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the god [[Myrkul]] appeared before Ketheric and promised him that which he desired most: Isobel returned to life once again. Ketheric sacrificed his body and [[soul]] to Myrkul in exchange for that boon. Ketheric's advisor Balthazar also returned and used a soulcage ritual to bind Aylin's immortal soul to Ketheric, which made him immortal as well. Isobel hated what her father had become, and denounced everything he had done to bring her back.  \n\nHe joined Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and [[Orin the Red]], in their plot to cultivate the [[cult of the Absolute]] and seize the [[Sword Coast]] for their own. Thorm would raise an army of undead at [[Moonrise Towers]] and march on [[Baldur's Gate]], while the other chosen of the [[Dead Three]] would carry out their own roles.\n\nHe would later be defeated within a mind flayer colony beneath Moonrise Towers by a group of adventurers who had been infected with the cult's altered mind flayer tadpoles, but who were granted resistance by a mysterious artifact. Mortally wounded, he called upon Myrkul to aid him, and allowed himself to fall into a pool of brine. He reemerged transformed into the [[Apostle of Myrkul]], the Lord of Bones' avatar, and fought the adventurers again before being defeated a final time."
