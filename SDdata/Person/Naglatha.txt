Naglatha (), alias the Black Flame, was a Red Wizard of Thay residing in Selgaunt in Sembia in 1357 DR.
Naglatha was a young, black-haired woman with a grim face.
Naglatha quickly rose through the ranks of the Red Wizards thanks to her fanatical zeal and ruthlessness. However, she was loyally devoted to the god Azuth.
Naglatha kept her devotion to Thay a secret from her associates in Selgaunt. She masqueraded as a merchant with a store that traded in magical items and curios from the South. Her shop was located on Larwaken Lane.
Naglatha arrived in Selgaunt early in 1357 DR with a very deep cover even Alzegund was unaware of her identity as a Red Wizard of Thay. Everyone in the Dragon Reach area thought she was only a merchant with a preference for extravagant tools from south Faer√ªn. In truth, using the alias "the Black Flame", she was recruiting valorous men to Thays cause. She always used a black mask in her mission in order to disguise her identity. Once a year she went "to the South" for three months, in truth traveling to Thay to receive new instructions.
Later she rose through the ranks thanks to the "accidental" death of Alzegund in 1364 DR. In 1373 DR, she was involved in a plot by the demon lord Eltab against Szass Tam, but the plan backfired thanks to the intervention of Thazienne Uskevren and Tam promised his vengeance against her.
