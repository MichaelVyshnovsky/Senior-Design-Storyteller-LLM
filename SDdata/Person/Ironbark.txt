'''Ironbark''' was a [[treant]] in [[Cormanthor]].

==History==
In [[1459 DR]], Ironbark and two other treants were captured by the [[dracolich]] [[Dretchroyaster]], who considered them a delicacy. In time, the dracolich slowly drained them of their life force.

By [[1479 DR]], only a half-mad Ironbark was still alive. That year, some adventurers infiltrated the lair and met the treant.

==Personality==
The long period of privation and fear had made him quite insane.
