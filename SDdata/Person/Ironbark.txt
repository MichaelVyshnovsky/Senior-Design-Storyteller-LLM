Ironbark was a treant in Cormanthor.
In 1459 DR, Ironbark and two other treants were captured by the dracolich Dretchroyaster, who considered them a delicacy. In time, the dracolich slowly drained them of their life force.
By 1479 DR, only a half-mad Ironbark was still alive. That year, some adventurers infiltrated the lair and met the treant.
The long period of privation and fear had made him quite insane.
