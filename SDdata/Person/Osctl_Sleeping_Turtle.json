He was the first to reach the creature, still encased in a meteorite, and intended to make a bargain with the creature so he could gain power.\nWhat happened afterward was unknown, except that the Star Worm was bound in a magical slumber. The city of Ixtzul was founded by Osctls tribe over where it slept, and he became the first Revered Counselor of Ixtzul. By claiming that he had made a bargain with the Star Worm and it was their protector, the tribe gained power over the other tribes."
