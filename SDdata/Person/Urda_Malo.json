        "mainbody": "'''Urda Malo''' was a baker who lived in the village of [[Eveningstar]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Urda was a thin, tall, and gruff woman who seemed never to gain weight despite eating and drinking excessively.",
        "Activities": "Urda ran the [[Eveningstar Bakery]] located along the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] near the center of the village. Her daughters helped run the bakery.",
        "History": "Urda Malo was an orphan from [[Riatavin]] in [[Amn]]. Eventually, she settled in Eveningstar and opened her famous bakery. When she reached her frail twilight years, Urda hired a small army of local women to be her live-in assistants. When Urda became senile, the women completely took over the bakery but continued to care for the old woman until her death of [[winterchill fever]]. These assistants continued operating Eveningstar Bakery, and as of the late-15{{th}} century DR, their children continued Urda Malo's legacy of making superb bread."
