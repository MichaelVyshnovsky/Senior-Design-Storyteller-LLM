Thuriya al-Kadari was an orc concubine of the Grand Caliph of Huzuz, Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir in 1367 DR.
Thuriya was not attractive by common standards but did offer Khalil genuine companionship.
Thuriya was an adventuring companion of Khalils during his younger days. He later realized she would make a fine companion and invited her to live in the Royal Harim as his concubine. They often talked and reminisced about their adventuring days.
