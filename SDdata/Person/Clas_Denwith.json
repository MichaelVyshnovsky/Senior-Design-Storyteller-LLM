        "mainbody": "General Clas Denwith was a belligerent priest of Tempus in the city of Ormpetarr, in Sespech during the late 14 century DR.\nAs the nations of Sespech and Chondath were constantly on the brink of war with one another around the year 1370 DR, General Denwith was often found giving speeches denouncing the their neighbors to the east. He proclaimed the ruling family of Arrabar as decadent and corrupt, stressing their military was non match for the forces of Sespech under the will of Tempus.\nAlthough he was an earnest priest who was devoted to the God of Battle, General Denwith was a pretty excitable and could get whipped up into something of a frenzy.\nFitting to his standing as a leader in the church of Tempus, he possessed a pair of gauntlets of ogre power and wore a ring of the ram."
