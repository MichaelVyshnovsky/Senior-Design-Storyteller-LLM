'''Starne''' was a young man of [[Yhaunn]] who joined the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|temple of Shar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Starne was a rowdy and shiftless young man of the upper classes, eager for fighting and carousing to relieve his boredom.

==History==
In [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], Starne was introduced to the newly-recruited [[Keph Thingoleir]] by [[Variance Amatick]] (disguised as [[Jarull Cartcoster]]). Starne joined [[Talisk]] and [[Baret]] in forming Keph's new social circle, joining him in carousing about the city and making him feel welcome in the [[church of Shar]].

On the night of the new moon, Starne joined Variance's attack on [[Moonshadow Hall]], thinking he would help tear down the temple rather than serving as an expendable distraction.
