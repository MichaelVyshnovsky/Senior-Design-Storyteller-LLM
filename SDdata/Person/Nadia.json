        "Description": "Nadia wore a circlet, a red robe and a breastplate of golden hue.",
        "History": "Nadia and her brother, [[Joril (cleric)|Joril]], were skilled in deception and helped to convince the populace that the [[evil]] Darkmoon temple had kind intentions. When the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] entered the temple, Nadia asked how she and her brother could be of service. The heroes, however, saw through their disguise, and tried to enter past the temple's entry hall. Nadia cleared her throat loudly, and eventually became hostile towards them."
