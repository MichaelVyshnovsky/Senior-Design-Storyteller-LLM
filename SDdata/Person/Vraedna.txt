'''Vraedna''' was a [[drow]] [[sorcerer]] of the adventuring company - the [[Lady's Lament]] from [[Waterdeep]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].

==Description==
Vraedna was a tall obsidian-skinned maiden with long white hair. She wielded a [[longsword]] and a [[shortbow]] in battle, as well as her impressive innate skills with the [[arcane]] magics. Relatively new to the surface, Vraedna's greatest fear was being abandoned by her comrades and left to fend for herself in the new and alien world.

==History==
Vraedna hailed from the grim pitch black [[Underdark]]. She was one of the rebel drow who chose to abandon the worship of [[Lolth]] and fled to the surface. Eventually, she joined the Lady's Lament in the City of Splendors. Vraedna hoped that being a member of the goodly adventuring troupe would improve her reputation and allow the surface world to overlook her evil heritage.

In 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from [[Luskan]] to the besieged city of [[Targos]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
