'''Phil Pious''' was a [[paladin]] in service of the [[Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Phil Pious and his [[enchanted]] ''[[fortress shield]]'' made a footnote in history when the paladin stood alone against an army of [[hobgoblin]] and [[kobold]] [[archer]] marauders. The shield, as tall as a man, protected Phil from the missiles and when the marauders ran out of ammunition, the paladin slew them in close combat. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the weapon ended up available for sale at the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]]'s [[Waukeen's Promenade]].
