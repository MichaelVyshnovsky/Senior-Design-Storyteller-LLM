        "mainbody": "ord Halueth Never was a sun elf warrior of Iliyanbruen and an early founder of the city of Neverwinter.\nIn the , the rulers of Illusk developed dreams of empire and began expanding to both the east and the south. However, in only three years, they were confronted by the elves of Iliyanbruen to the south. Halueth Never became prominent as a warrior in their battles. Finally, in the Year of Burning Glades, −10 DR, Halueth led the elves of Iliyanbruen to defeat the forces of Illusk and finally put a halt to Illuskan expansion southward, though skirmishing between their sides would continue.\nIt was said that he had to overcome many trials and hardships in his later life. He occupied a keep that came to be part of Castle Never,Neverwinter Nights states that Neverwinter was \"originally founded by Lord Halueth Never\" and \"the trials that he overcame to found the city of Neverwinter\", though other canon histories of Neverwinter make it clearly a human settlement with a human name, with no mention of Halueth and the name Never apparently being coincidental. Taken together, it is likely that his keep is considered a precursor to this settlement.\nLord Halueth was served by nine knights—Talven, Galavren, Floashebel, Thracier (who turned traitor), Shoce, Coneth, Nhalien, Tamper, and Slade—upon whom the later Neverwinter Nine knighthood would be based. For his knights, Halueth had crafted nine enchanted swords of alchemical silver, after which the Ceremonial Sword of Neverwinter used to induct new members of the Nine would be copied.\nHe was said to be interred in a tomb under Castle Never. According to local legend, he lay on a massive slab of stone and was ringed by twelve unsheathed swords of different kinds, their points outward. The swords were magical and never rusted nor decayed, but would animate and attack all trespassers. Only by following exactly the instructions inscribed on the flagstones in cryptic verses could one avoid having to fight them. If defeated, the animating spell was broken and they became ordinary swords that could be retrieved.\nHalueth was briefly mentioned in The Leadership of Neverwinter and priests at the Hall of Justice temple of Tyr in the late 14 century would seek his tomb, though the Wailing Death ended their efforts in the . That year, on Reverend Judge Oleff Uskars behalf, the Hero of Neverwinter potentially explored four prospective Never Tombs around the city, retrieving the Ancient Chronicles of Halueth Never from one in the Great Cemetery, among other relics. Finally, the Hero would come across what seemed to be Halueth Nevers tomb itself, not beneath Castle Never but behind a secret passage in a house in the Blacklake District, and would have to get past only four attacking animated Swords of Never to reach the sarcophagus. This held Halueths rusted armor, which would be a valued treasure of Neverwinter if recovered.Its unclear if this is meant to truly be Halueths tomb, as Neverwinter Nights and its sequel give two different depictions. It may be this is another false tomb, as no body is apparent and only four swords guard it, while the second fits the canon legend much more closely.\nIn the , the dark forces of the King of Shadows infiltrated Castle Never and attacked all within. The castles defenders sealed off its various sections, unfortunately dividing its defenders. But in this time of need, the castles Neverneath opened to allow the Kalach-Cha and companions through. By answering questions of Neverwinter and swearing loyalty to the city, or else defeating the Guardians of Neverneath, the Kalach-Cha reached the true tomb of Lord Halueth Never, with his undecayed body still lying in repose on a bier and ringed by eight statues representing the first Neverwinter Nine—the ninth was absent—as well as their nine floating magical swords. The successful visitor was invited to take the place of the ninth, thus marking them as a future member of the Neverwinter Nine, and being granted a magical sword, Blessing of the Daystar. Furthermore, the body held the Rod of Never so that it might be bequeathed to the future Lord of Castle Never it also controlled the castles magical defenses. The Kalach-Cha reached Lord Nasher Alagondar, gave him the Rod of Never, and was knighted as one of the Neverwinter Night.\nHalueth Never wore a fine suit of plate mail armor. Though later found badly rusted, it was etched with designs including the holy symbol of Tyr."
