They followed Ellifain to the city of Silverymoon, where her trail went cold.{{Fact}}\n\nIn [[1371 DR]], when the orc king Obould Many-Arrows and his massive army of orcs and giants invaded the Silver Marches, Tarathiel fought bravely beside his lover Innovindil and Drizzt Do'Urden before being sliced in half by [[Obould Many-Arrows]].{{fact}}",
