        "mainbody": "abal Mizzrym was a priestess of House Mizzrym in Menzoberranzan in the midâ€“14 century.\nSabal was the daughter of Matron Mother Mizri Mizzrym and the twin sister of Greyanna Mizzrym and a sister of Pharaun Mizzrym.\nAlthough the two sisters were very similar, Mizri seemed to prefer Greyanna and, without support, Sabal slowly fell into obscurity until she was viewed a fool unfit for the simplest of tasks. It was at that point that Pharaun stepped in and began aiding Sabal, helping her rise through the ranks of the house. This infuriated Greyanna, and she vowed revenge upon Pharaun. After chasing him through the house one night in an attempt to kill him, he escaped to the wizard academy Sorcere at Tier Breche, where he was able to obtain a post as a master.\nFinally, Greyanna tricked Sabal into accepting a cursed amulet that made Sabal very ill until she died. In 1372 DR, after another confrontation with Pharaun, which she lost, Greyanna asked him why he had helped the youngest twin and not accepted her alliance, as they were identical. Pharaun explained that it was only an intellectual challenge, to raise someone from obscurity to glory."
