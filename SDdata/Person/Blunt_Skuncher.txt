'''Blunt Skuncher''' was an [[evoker]] [[mage]] thug who opposed the [[The Guild]] crime gang of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Skuncher was a [[human]] man with an olive skin tone and seceding brown hair. He wore a red [[sorcerer]]'s [[robe]]s and was armed with a simple [[quarterstaff]].

==Abilities==
Blunt Skuncher's [[spell]] repertoire was limited to simple ''[[firebolt]]s'' and ''[[magic missile]]s.''

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], [[Farlin]] led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], including Blunt Skuncher. They clashed under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]] over a shipment of supplies. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and either of squads's fate remained uncertain.
