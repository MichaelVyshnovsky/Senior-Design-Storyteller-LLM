Shynlar Draal was one of the more reliable members of the Xanathars Thieves Guild in Skullport in 1379 DR.
In 1379 DR, Shynlar was investigating the slaver Lanador, a rival of the Xanathar, when he was captured together with some other elvesÂ by some Unyielding Sword mercenaries working for Lanador. He managed to keep his mission secret. However, the Xanathar engineered a rescue mission, collaborating with an adventuring party hired by the City Watch.Derek Myers. "Eyes on The Ball." Dungeon #206. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.  
Shynlar was very loyal to his beholder master, who imbued him with some of the Xanathars aberrant essence.
Shynlar could corrupt minds at a touch and could open a third eye in the middle of his forehead that fired deadly rays.
