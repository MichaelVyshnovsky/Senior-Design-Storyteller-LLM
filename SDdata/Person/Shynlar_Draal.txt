'''Shynlar Draal''' was one of the more reliable members of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1379 DR]].

==History==
In 1379 DR, Shynlar was investigating the slaver [[Lanador]], a rival of the [[Xanathar]], when he was captured together with some other [[elves]]Â by some [[Unyielding Sword]] mercenaries working for Lanador. He managed to keep his mission secret. However, the Xanathar engineered a rescue mission, collaborating with an adventuring party hired by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]].[[Derek Myers]]. "Eyes on The Ball." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.  

==Personality==
Shynlar was very loyal to his [[beholder]] master, who imbued him with some of the Xanathar's aberrant essence.

==Powers==
Shynlar could corrupt minds at a touch and could open a third eye in the middle of his forehead that fired deadly rays.
