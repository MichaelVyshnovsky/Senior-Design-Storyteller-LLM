        "mainbody": "'''Veltig''' was a high [[knight]] in the [[Blood Riders]] organization around the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Much of Veltig's history was unknown beyond the inscriptions on his burial site. They stated that at some point, several decades prior to [[1366 DR]],{{Giantcraft date}} he was waging a campaign with the Blood Riders against the [[giant]]s that lived throughout [[Hartsvale]] when he was killed by a party of [[fire giant]]s.\n\nVeltig was laid to rest in a large mausoleum inside a small town that lay alongside the [[Clear Whirl River]], near [[Castle Hartwick]]. Around 1366 DR, damage was discovered in the tomb that suggested someone from inside it had broken out. The craftsmen working with the town's leaders to keep this a secret speculated that his restless spirit may have escaped. The town's leaders linked the incident to the various strange incidences that were occurring around that time due to the [[Twilight Spirit]]."
