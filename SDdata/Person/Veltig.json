        "mainbody": "eltig was a high knight in the Blood Riders organization around the early 14 century DR.\nMuch of Veltigs history was unknown beyond the inscriptions on his burial site. They stated that at some point, several decades prior to 1366 DR, he was waging a campaign with the Blood Riders against the giants that lived throughout Hartsvale when he was killed by a party of fire giants.\nVeltig was laid to rest in a large mausoleum inside a small town that lay alongside the Clear Whirl River, near Castle Hartwick. Around 1366 DR, damage was discovered in the tomb that suggested someone from inside it had broken out. The craftsmen working with the towns leaders to keep this a secret speculated that his restless spirit may have escaped. The towns leaders linked the incident to the various strange incidences that were occurring around that time due to the Twilight Spirit."
