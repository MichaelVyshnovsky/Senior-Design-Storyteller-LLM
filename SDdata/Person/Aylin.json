        "mainbody": "Dame Aylin was an aasimar and the daughter of the goddess Selûne, who was imprisoned within the Shadowfell by General Ketheric Thorm in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nShe had pale skin that was uniquely blemished, appearing as cracked marble, and light blonde hair she kept sheared on one side and long, brushed back along the other. She had white, feathered wings that granted her flight.\nAylin was a strong-willed, resilient and vengeful person. If she were ever wronged, Aylin would vow the full revenge with the full wrath of the heavens upon her foes. She was also quite direct, particularly about her feelings, even openly discussing her sexual attraction to Isobel in front of new friends. It was possible Aylins vengeful, brash personality was the result of the trauma from a century of suffering as Ketheric Thorms source of immortality and the horrific experiments and torture Balthazar subjected her to.\nAylin served her divine mother Selûne as a paladin.\nSome time during the late 14 century DR, Aylin fell in love with Isobel Thorm, a devoted follower of Selûne. Isobels father, Ketheric, assumed the love wasnt genuine but was wrong even after over one hundred years being tortured and repeatedly killed and resurrected in the Shadowfell, Isobels death was still a painful memory for Aylin. She also referred to Isobel as \"her consort\" while praying to Selûne, giving the relationship a formal affirmation.\nHer relationship with Ketheric himself was more complicated. He didnt approve of Aylin being intimate with his daughter, and yet she was the daughter of Ketherics patron deity, so the two kept a respectful distance from each other. When Isobel died, they both shared the pain of her loss, but did not bond over the experience. Any good will Aylin may have had towards Ketheric ended when he tricked her into the soul cage in Shadowfell. His betrayal of Selûne, especially given he abandoned the deitys service in favor of Shar, deceiving her and the pain and abuses she suffered there gave Aylin a deadly, burning hatred of Ketheric.\nSome time circa the , Ketheric Thorm and his advisor Balthazar tricked and abducted Dame Aylin and imprisoned her within a soul cage in the Shadowfell for his then-goddess Shar. In return, Ketheric would be spared the loss and pain that accompanied the death of his daughter Isobel, who happened to be Aylins lover. After Aylin was imprisoned  behind a gate underneath the Gauntlet of Shar, the immortal strength of Aylins soul was transferred to Ketheric by unholy necromantic magic, granting the general eternal life.\nAylin was subjected to a century of torture and brutal experiments by Balthazar. She was also repeatedly slain by the goddess would-be Dark Justiciars time and time again, only to return trapped within her cage. During this time, Dame Aylin came to be known as the Nightsong. Isobel never forgave her father for the horrors he subjected Aylin to.\nIn the , the wizard Lorroakan of Baldurs Gate attempted to secure the Nightsong for himself. He posted a bounty offering much riches for her retrieval. At least one adventuring party, led by Aradin, took the mage up on his offer."
