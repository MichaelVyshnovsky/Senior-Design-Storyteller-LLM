        "mainbody": "hanthi () was a merchant prince in Port Nyanzaru, Chult during the late 15 century DR. She controlled the sale of gems, jewelry, colorful Chultan cloth, and armor within the city.\nZhanthi was an old merchant, trader, and nobelwoman who traced her ancestry back to Chultan royalty.\nShe was considered to be very wise, and few in Port Nyanzaru dared to question her judgment. She was calm and collected even during times of crisis, She had sentimental attachments to the memory of ancient Chultan dynasties, and was keen to collect objects of significance to Chultan royalty, such as the Skull Chalice of Chgakare.\nZhanthi held a monopoly over all trade in jewels from the Chultan mines and the jewelry made from them, as well as cloth and nonmagical leather, studded leather, and hide armors.While Zhanthi sold armor, a different merchant prince, Ekene-Afa controlled the sale of shields. The sale of any magical equipment would require the cooperation of yet another prince, Wakanga Otamu. Anyone wishing to engage in the trade of these goods had to deal either with her or her consortium. As part of her control of the jewel trade, her agents and guards policed the Jewel Market in Port Nyanzarus Merchants Ward.\nShe had a network of spies who worked undercover to deter jewel thieves and pickpockets and was known to hire adventurers, whom she might supply with acid bombs or reward with magic items to help them complete their assigned missions.\nAs a member of the merchant princes council, she helped to govern Port Nyanzaru from the palace of Goldenthrone.\nZhanthi owned a lavish and well-defended villa atop Port Nyanzarus Throne Hill in the Merchants Ward. and Zhanthi displayed the bejeweled skulls of her noble ancestors in glass cases and in niches in the walls. She received visitors to her villa while seated on a gilded throne while being fanned by her servants.\nZhanthi was a secret member of the hidden Ytepka Society, To offend her was also to offend the Society. She also had strong professional ties to the Zhentarim (despite personal disagreements) as well as spies among the Flaming Fist, mostly for the purpose of keeping tabs on these factions activities. Zhanthi also had spies within the mercenary army of Mother Sibonseni, Port Nyanzarus wealthy and powerful high priestess of Waukeen this included Sibonsenis master-at-arms, Kwalu Mosi.\nHer only son, Shago, worked as a guide for the Flaming Fist at Fort Beluarian as of the late 15 century DR. While it was her understanding that he served as her spy within their ranks, he was in fact more loyal to the Flaming Fist, who he believed to be better equipped to fight back the undead plaguing Chult. As such, he would only rarely give her any valuable intel, making him one of her less useful spies among the Flaming Fist.\nIf a rival noble required placating, Zhanthi was known to send entertainers to perform rare plays for them, such as Winter in the Midnight Garden.\nZhanthi once secured a job for a smuggler named Jailo Mek working as a beast herder for fellow merchant prince Ifan Talroa at the dinosaur pens in Tiryki Anchorage.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Zhanthi was one of the richest people in Port Nyanzaru and the eldest among the merchant princes.\nAt some point, she discovered the relationship between Liara Portyr, the leader of Fort Beluarian, and the pirates of Jahaka Anchorage. While she did not make this knowledge public, she did arrange for Port Nyanzarus harbormaster, Zindar, to be able to offer a large reward to dispose of the pirates.\nWhen the fiendish pirate Idrianne Smoke laid siege to Port Nyanzaru during the events of the death curse, Zhanthi leveraged her personal connections to try to force Sibonsenis mercenaries to join the citys defense as well as to learn more about Captain Smokes true nature."
