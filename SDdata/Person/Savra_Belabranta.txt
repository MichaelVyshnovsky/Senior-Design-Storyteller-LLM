'''Savra Belabranta''' ({{Pronounce|SAV|rah|_|bel|ah|BRAN|tah|refs=}}) was a member of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis of [[1491 DR]], but later became a member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Personality==
While a member of the Cult, Savra was totally brainwashed by it and fully believed everything.

==Relationships==
Savra was a member of the [[Belabranta]]s, a noble Waterdhavian family whose main activity was raising [[griffon]]s to serve as mounts for the [[Griffon Cavalry]].

==History==
Savra hailed from Waterdeep, where she joined the [[Feathergale Knights]], a cover group for the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]]. There, she was indoctrinated into the worship of [[Yan-C-Bin]]. In [[1491 DR]], Savra showed some adventurers the [[Feathergale Spire]].

Some time later, Savra repented from her cultist days and became a member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]. Fully reformed, she began to serve [[Tyr]] in an attempt to atone for the evil acts she committed and to regain her honor. She returned to Waterdeep and worked for the Order at the [[Halls of Justice]], assigning missions and swearing new members into the Order.
