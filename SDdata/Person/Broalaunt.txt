'''Broalaunt''' was a [[Thayan]] cursed by [[Samaerra]], an apprentice of [[Larloch]], to become a [[boar]] after he became too familiar with her at a [[Magefair]]. He had to achieve a series of unbindings by performing great tasks; such as eating thirteen rabid chipmunks, and kissing the [[Simbul]], among others. As a boar he was known as '''Warpig''', and his companion was a [[half-orc]] named [[Orokh]].{{Cite web/Never a Warpig Born}}
