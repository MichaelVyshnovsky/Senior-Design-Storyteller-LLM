'''Droo Falbo''' was a member of the [[Gondian]] clergy and a foundry worker from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Droo Falbo was a [[rock gnome]] man with a light skin tone, light brown eyes, and a long light brown hair. He wore a foundry worker's uniform and a smith's [[apron]], often covered in soot, dirt, and sweat.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Gondian foundry of Baldur's Gate was usurped by [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[cultists of Bane]]. Droo Falbo and other Gondians were forced to work on forging the Lord's [[steel watcher]]s. Their families and loved ones were abducted and held hostage to encourage obedience, and all of the workers were outfitted with ''[[incineration collar]]s''  controlled by ''[[Prinski's Motivator]]s.''

With the [[Absolute crisis]] unfolding in Baldur's Gate, the fate of the Gondians remained unconfirmed. It was possible for all of the hostages and foundry workers to perish, or be saved along with their loved ones by the group of heroes known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]].
