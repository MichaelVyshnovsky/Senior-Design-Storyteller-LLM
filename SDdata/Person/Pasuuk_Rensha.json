        "History": "In the [[1315 DR|Year of Spilled Blood, 1315 DR]], Pasuuk ordered a band of talented mercenary hunters to obtain for him a [[unicorn]]'s horn. His reasons for this were not known, but some worried it was for a ritual of dark [[magic]] that would link [[High Lord's Hall]] with the [[Nine Hells]], and he was later confirmed to consort with [[devil]]s.\n\nBut, when they caught the unicorn, one of the hunters, a [[Nimbral]]i mercenary named [[Nanathlor Greysword]], instead defended the beast, became the [[Green Regent]], and rebelled against the rule of Pasuuk Rensha. He and his followers fought to overthrow the Renshas and liberate Loudwater, launching the [[War of the Returned Regent]].\n\nAfter two years of fierce fighting, the war culminated in the [[Battle of Tanglefork]] in the {{YearlinkName|1317}}, when Pasuuk and his forces confronted Nanathlor and his ragtag band near Tanglefork Woods on the southern fringe of the [[High Forest]] near the [[River Delimbiyr]].<ref> Nanathlor called on the goddess [[Mielikki]] for aid, and she ''[[awaken]]ed'' the trees around the battlefield and set them to attack Pasuuk's forces. In response, Pasuuk summoned a coven of [[devil]]s to assault the trees. Ultimately, Mielikki's servants were victorious and the devils and Pasuuk were all killed in the fighting. The corpses of Pasuuk and his fiendish allies were scattered like filth, blackening the soil of Tanglefork Woods with their evil. Over half a century later, it was still as dark as midnight."
