'''Deckon Thar''' was a bandit king and founding member of the royal line that led the [[Chieftains in Gold]].

==History==
He was the first of the bandit lords of the Chieftains in Gold to be interred in a secret barrow in the [[Nether Mountains]] along with his treasures. This began a trend among the Chieftains, and a total of seven burial mounds were filled with their combined riches. In his honor, these came to be remembered as the [[Tombs of Deckon Thar]].
