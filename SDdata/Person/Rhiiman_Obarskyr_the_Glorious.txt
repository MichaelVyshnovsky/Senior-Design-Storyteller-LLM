'''Rhiiman the Glorious''' (real name '''Rhiiman Obarskyr''') was the fifth king of [[Cormyr]]. He reigned from [[66 DR]] until his death in [[79 DR]].

==Relatives==
His namesake was his [[Rhiiman Obarskyr|uncle]], who abandoned Cormyr to go back to [[Impiltur]] when his father [[Faerlthann Obarskyr|Faerlthann]]'s mother ([[Suzara Obarskyr]]) got tired of his grandfather [[Ondeth Obarskyr|Ondeth]]. He was the youngest of Faerlthann's four sons but was third in their succession to the throne after he outlived [[Imlon Obarskyr|Imlon]], [[Eskruis Obarskyr|Eskruis]], and his nephew [[Bryndar Obarskyr|Bryndar]]. He was succeeded by his last remaining brother, [[Embrus Obarskyr|Embrus]].
