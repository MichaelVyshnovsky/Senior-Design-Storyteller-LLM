Eve was an elderly widow from Phlan that spent her time in idle gossip and daydreaming about the lives of tohers circa the 1480s DR.
Eve and her friend Esma met weekly at Madame Freonas Tea Kettle. They spent their time people-watching and endlessly chattering on about the possible lives they led.
Either Eve or Esma owned a magical, yet somewhat boring, amulet that was enchanted to stay clean and not become tarnished.
