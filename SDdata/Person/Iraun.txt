Iraun was a mage, and along with Srivven, one of the self-proclaimed kings of Adaerglast around 1374.
They originally came from easternmost Murghôm after a battle broke out in their school of magic between students and their masters. Before arriving in Adaerglast, Iraun and Srivven traveled Faerûn, plundering mages tombs and seizing spells from living wizards. Iraun had no actual right to rule over Adearglast, although he and Srivven believed that the gods had appointed them this task. They had resisted several attacks and, due to the strong magic in Adaerglast, had protected themselves by setting up many very powerful spellwebs.
