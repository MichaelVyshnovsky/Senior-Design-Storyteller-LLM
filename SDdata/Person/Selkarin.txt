King '''Selkarin''' was the ruler of [[Estagund]] in the [[Shining South]] during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Selkarin led an invasion of [[Durpar]] and [[Veldorn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1053}}. Both nations resisted his advances so Selkarin turned his attention to [[Dambrath]]. His fleet attacked Dambrath's southern coast but were beaten back with severity, resulting in Selkarin's death.

==Relationships==
Selkarin was a descendant of King [[Bonrial]]. As Selkarin died without producing any offspring, his brother [[Seltarir]] took the throne upon his death.
