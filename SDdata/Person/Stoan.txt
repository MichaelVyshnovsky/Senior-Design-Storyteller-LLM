Sergeant Stoan was a veteran Purple Dragon who commanded the border outpost on the Moonsea Ride north of Arabel in the late 14 century DR.
Stoan was a large, burly man.
Stoan was a simple, conscientious soldier who loved Cormyr and wished to do right by others. He took care of the Dragons under him and made sure that travelers were treated fairly at his outpost.
Stoan wore +2 chainmail and carried a +1 longsword. He also carried a master key for unlocking the most secure doors in the outpost.
As commander of the outpost, he was responsible for his ten Purple Dragons, as well as the War Wizard Torvis Mull. He greeted and interviewed travelers on the road as they entered Cormyr, and patiently informed them of the laws of Cormyr to ensure there were no misunderstandings.
