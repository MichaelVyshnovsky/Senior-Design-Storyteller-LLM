'''Hallaster''' was a messenger sent from [[Kuldahar]].

==Activities==
The messenger was sent to ask the people of [[Easthaven]] for information about strange disturbances in the surrounding [[Spine of the World]], such as [[giant]] sightings and [[goblin]] raiders.

==Relationships==
Hallaster was a friend and student of [[druid|Archdruid]] [[Arundel]] of Kuldahar.

==History==
In [[Eleint]], [[1281 DR]], Hallaster traveled from Kuldahar, but was wounded and died before the doors of the [[Temple of  Tempus (Easthaven)|Temple of Tempus]] in Easthaven. His dread news motivated the priest [[Everard]] and [[Hrothgar]] to plan an expedition to Kuldahar in the Spine of the World.
