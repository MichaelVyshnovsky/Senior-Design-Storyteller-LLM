Iahn Qoyllor was a Deep Imaskari vengeance taker. He was sent out to find Ususi Manaallin in .
Iahn Qoyllor had eyes like icy winter. He dressed with hide leggins the color of volcanic stone, and his leather vambraces were blood red from elbow to wrist. Per a courtesan from Vaelan, his arms were described as sinewy, and his skin as pale and exotic. 
Iahn was an imaskari vengeance taker. He carried one of the 21 Damos of Deep Imaskar, which was the source of some of his supernatural abilities. He most often used it to gain unique insights.
He was also able to use some spells, likely blur, dimension door, and invisibility. Disguises fashioned by Iahn included some components of illusion magic. He was sensitive to flows of magic. One of his daily protective spells warned him when under unseen observation.
Despite the diminished martial instruction available in Deep Imaskar, Iahn was an excellent fighter even by the standards of other races.
He wielded a repeating crossbow and a dagger that split between a stiletto and a butterfly knife.
As of the spring of , he had been on Ususi Manaallins trail for two months.
When he caught up to her coach wagon, he found several creatures that attacked him upon slaying them, he learned they served Pandorym.
When he followed into the ruin she was visiting at the time, a trap she left unsprung captured him on her way back, she took the opportunity to interrogate him. She learned Deep Imaskar was under attack, and her expertise with the Celestial Nadir was required to prevent it.
She convinced Iahn to travel with her to Vaelan, in order to find an entrance to the Nadir, instead of returning directly to Deep Imaskar.
In Vaelan, Iahn and Ususi investigated the Body Shop. There, Iahn discovered a lurking, hostile presence within the plangent shopkeeper. Shortly after, the two of them encountered Eined Datharathi. She wanted their help stopping the production of Datharathi crystal they accepted, though they only intended to seek an entrance to the Celestial Nadir.
The three of them chartered a ship towards Adamas Tooth, where they were confronted by Shaddon Datharathi.
The wizard slew Eined, and the two deep imaskari fought him unable to slay him, they fled for an entrance to the Celestial Nadir.
In the demiplane, they encountered Warian Datharathi and Zeltaebar Datharathi.
Finding a path into the Palace of the Purple Emperor, they were briefly detained by a trap.
Prince Monolith and Kiril Duskmourn rescued them from it after they joined, the six of them headed for the Imperial Weapons Cache.
There, Iahn would fight the forces of Pandorym, using a crossbow he liberated from the very cache.
