Ameralis Zauviir was a drow cleric who had a connection with the Watchers Keep in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Interestingly enough, Ameralis possessed some inherent resistances that were typically found in demonic beings. She also had some form of natural regeneration.
She wore a suit of full plate armor along with a piwafwi.
Ameralis and her companions served as one of the three groups connected to the fifth level of Watchers Keep, which held the final seal that kept away the being known as the Imprisoned One. The group was summoned to the keep when the heart key was used to unlock the seal.
