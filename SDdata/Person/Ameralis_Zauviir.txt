'''Ameralis Zauviir''' was a [[drow]] [[cleric]] who had a connection with the [[Watcher's Keep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Interestingly enough, Ameralis possessed some inherent resistances that were typically found in [[demon]]ic beings. She also had some form of natural [[regeneration]].

==Possessions==
She wore a suit of ''[[full plate]]'' armor along with a ''[[piwafwi]]''.

==Activities==
Ameralis and her companions served as one of the three groups connected to the fifth level of Watcher's Keep, which held the final seal that kept away the being known as the [[Imprisoned One]]. The group was summoned to the keep when the heart key was used to unlock the seal.

==Relationships==
Her companions included the demons [[Nalmissra]], [[Xei Win Toh]], [[Y'tossi]], and the [[Huntress]], along with an unnamed [[hive mother]].

==History==
Ameralis and her allies were killed in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, when [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions bypassed the final seal of Watcher's Keep and reached the Imprisoned One.
