Breltora Red-Eye was a half-orc stonemason in Leilon in the late 15 century DR.
Breltora Red-Eye was friends with the Neverwintan soldier Private Vester Jessup.
Circa 1491 DR, Private Jessups commander, Sergeant Hazz Yorrum, sent him and three other soldiers to patrol the High Road along the Mere of Dead Men. When the patrol didnt return after already being two days late, Breltora began to worry. However, Yorrum did nothing to investigate the disappearance of the soldiers, so Breltora contacted a group of adventurers. Breltora and the adventurers pressed Yorrum into showing them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued the missing soldiers, who had been captured by a lizardfolk tribe.
