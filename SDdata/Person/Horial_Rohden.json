        "mainbody": "'''Horial Rohden''' was the scion of the noble [[House Rohden]] of [[Arrabar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The young noble kept occasional three-day stubble and had disheveled black hair.",
        "Personality": "Horial was the meeker of the three friends. He was easily overwhelmed and had stress stomach cramps.",
        "Relationships": "Horial was childhood friends with two other noble family scions of Arrabar, [[Vambran Matrell]] of [[House Matrell]] and [[Adyan Mercatio]] of [[House Mercatio]].",
        "History": "In the [[Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}} during the [[Night of Ghosts]] festival hosted by [[Eles Wianar]], the Lord of Arrabar. Horial Rohden, along with his two friends Vambran and Adyan were in attendance. The trio was playing around with a bejeweled [[crossbow]], gifted to young Vambran by his uncle [[Kovrim Matrell]]. Shooting [[plantain]]s off a [[tree]], Vambran unleashed a stray [[bolt]] that lodged itself in a stranger's chest, killing him. The victim was [[Rodolpho Wianar]], a cousin of the Lord of Arrabar. Xaphira Matrell and her brother [[Dregaul Matrell]] knew that this accidental murder meant death for Vambran and ruin for House Matrell. Desperate to see her nephew unharmed, Xaphira took the blame. She masqueraded as an assassin and fled Arrabar, likely never to be able to return again.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Adyan Mercatio and Horial Rohden have joined the elite [[Waukeenar]] militaristic organization - The [[Order of the Sapphire Crescent]], following Vambran Matrell's lead. Among the three friends, Vambran held the highest rank of the lieutenant. They traveled wide and far across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] aboard the ''[[Lady's Favor]]''.\n\nOn [[Tarsakh 10]] of 1373 DR, the ''Lady's Favor'' returned to Arrabar bearing a bounty of imported goods from [[Sembia]]. Soon after arrival, Horial's friend and lieutenant Vambran Matrell witnessed a murder of a commoner and committed to investigating the injustice. The investigation led Vambran to uncover a sinister conspiracy, plan to profit from a war of which young commoner woman was a casualty. On [[Tarsakh 11]], Horial, Adyan Mercatio, and Vambran met up for a drink at the [[Crying Claw]] tavern, where the scion of House Matrell asked his two friends to aid the investigation. Vambran wanted to track the murderer using his magic and a jeweled [[dagger]] that the culprit stole from [[Emriana Matrell]]. Horial and Adyan agreed and followed Vambran into a warehouse in Arrabar's Warehouse District. They discovered the killer's body, but it was a trap. The cabal left a deadly [[leechwalker]] to dispose of the nobleman interloper. The trio battled the creature. Horial only wielded a [[shortsword]] and stood no chance against the lumbering blood-hungry thing. The leechwalker quickly embraced and incapacitated Adyan while Horial was dispatched with a crushing blow. Miraculously, all three survived the assassination attempt thanks to Vambran's healing magics and a mysterious red-clad figure that emptied a barrel of [[salt]] on the beast.\n\nHorial and Adyan recovered via the [[Temple of Waukeen (Arrabar)|Temple of Waukeen's]] [[cleric]]s healing spells and on [[Tarsakh 13]] were ordered to depart Arrabar on a mission, secretly organized by the Grand Trabbar [[Lavant]], in order to remove Vambran from his investigation and from the city. Horial and Adyan decided to cover for their friend, delaying the departure as he attended his sister's sixteenth birthday celebration. As the noble party dissolved into chaos following the revelation that Vambran's own family was involved with the cabal, Horial, Adyan, and a squad of Sapphire Crescents, were dispatched by the temple to return the missing lieutenant to his duty. The Crescents got themselves involved in opposing the cabal that took Vambran's family members hostages and eventually confronted [[Denrick Pharaboldi]] and [[Evester Matrell]], leading to the villains' deaths."
