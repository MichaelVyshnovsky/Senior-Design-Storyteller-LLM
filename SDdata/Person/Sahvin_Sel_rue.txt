Sahvin Selrue was a drow scout of QXorlarrin in 1484 DR.
Sahvin was one of the top scouts of her city.
During the War of the Silver Marches in 1485 DR, she was part of a contingent directed by Shontiq ALavallier that spied on Silverymoon, until the Knights in Silver attacked, killing most of the drow. Sahvin tried to escape to the camp of a nearby orc army but the Luruar army commanded by Regis, Wulfgar, and Aleina Brightlance defeated them also.
