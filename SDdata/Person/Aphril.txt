'''Aphril''' was a seer and an inmate of the [[Spellhold]] asylum in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
The [[wizard]] was kept in Spellhold, the Residence for the Magically Deviant, for her sage-like abilities. Experimenting with planar travel gave her awareness of sights beyond the known world. Aphril was driven mad by her ability to stare through and across the [[planes]], as well as at their denizens.Aphril makes comments about happenings of these otherwordly planes and places that are clearly references to other ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' video games, such as ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. For ''Neverwinter Nights'', she commented: "I see... a place... coming soon... where there is... never winter... where people have control... over their own stories." For ''Planescape: Torment'', which was set in the center of the multiverse, [[Sigil]], the seer commented: "I see... a city of changing streets under the Lady of Pain. My eyes... pluck out my eyes.", a reference to the ruler of Sigil. She also made a comment about the [[Nameless One]], the game's protagonist: "I see... a walking corpse... he speaks... to a pillar of skulls? See, it is madness!"

She did not sleep much, and would apparently be studied so that some good may come of her condition. Her eyes did "not close when closed", so she was never truly alone, always surrounded by mysterious places and creatures.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Aphril was amongst the inmates at Spellhold when it was taken over by [[Jon Irenicus]]. When [[Gorion's Ward]] arrived seeking [[Imoen]], despite Aphril's initial caution, she was goaded into battling the evil elven archmage to avenge the torments she had suffered under his hands. Unfortunately, like the rest of the inmates, she evidently perished.
