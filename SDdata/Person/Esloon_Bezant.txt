Esloon Bezant was an exiled Red Wizard of Thay in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Esloon had been exiled from Thay a few years before and settled in Waterdeep, where he started a small criminal organization in the Dock Ward.
In 1492 DR, the Zhentarim courted him in order to try to add his gang of thugs to their ranks. However, Jalester Silvermane, under the orders of the Lords Alliance, wanted to hire some adventurers to ruin this alliance.
Esloon was too smart to get caught doing something illegal.
