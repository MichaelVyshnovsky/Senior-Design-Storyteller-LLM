        "mainbody": "Ao\nLady Tatrina Hembreon was a royal corlann of Tethyr during the reign of Queen Zaranda Rhindaun, tending to the royal nursery.\nTatrina was a beautiful blonde-haired woman. While serving the cult of Ao in Zazesspur as an adolescent, she dressed in a simple white robe and wore a golden torque about her neck.\nBecause of the horrors that she survived during the Days of Terror, Tatrina refused to ever set foot in the city of Zazesspur, her original home, again.\nIn her role as corlann, Lady Tatrina cared for the queens three children, which gave her a distraction from her terrifying memories from the Days of Terror.\nTatrina was the only surviving daughter of Alaric Hembreon, Duke of the Golden Marches. He was very fond of his daughter and had a difficult time telling her no or disciplining her.\nAs a young adult, in her role as corlann, she was subordinate to Corwin Vineshigh, the royal farsann, who was in turn subordinate to Lord Tannar Grannox, the royal sammafar.\nIn the time leading up to the Days of Terror in the city of Zazesspur, Tatrina had joined the All Friends, the local cult of Ao. Once, when then-Countess Zaranda Star was discussing with Tatrinas father how she might extradite the process of recovering her impounded goods, Tatrina was dragged before her father by his guards, having been caught stealing money from his purse to give to the poor in the name of Ao."
