'''Reglin''' was a [[proxy]] of the [[Norse pantheon|Norse]] [[power]] known as [[Heimdall]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|25}}

==Description==
Reglin was a tall and strong man, with blond hair and brown eyes.

==Abilities==
Reglin could invoke Heimdall to cast ''[[prismatic wall]]''.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|29}}

==Possessions==
Reglin wielded a [[broadsword]] for a weapon. He typically favored dressing in clothes and decorations that were shades of red and yellow.

==Activities==
As a proxy of a god of guards and sentries, Reglin himself lived as a devoted sentry of the [[Aesir]], spending much of his time guarding the [[Bifrost]]. When he wasn't on duty at the Bifrost he spent his time at [[Gloamingard]], a longhouse he built to rest at when not on duty.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] journeyed to the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]], having been instructed by the city's [[Ministry of Art]] to do so in order to learn how a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]'' could be destroyed.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} They arrived in the layer of [[Ysgard (layer)|Asgard]] by means of a ship,{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|13}} While coasting through the waters of Asgard, they eventually came across Reglin's Gloamingard along the shoreline.

Prior to their arrival, the wandering realm of the [[Seelie Court (divine realm)|Seelie Court]] had arrived to the area and asked for Reglin's hospitality. He was quite surprised, but obliged, not wishing to offend Queen [[Titania]]. When the adventurers entered Reglin's hall they found him socializing with Titania, whilst his courtiers were busy trying to keep her rowdy [[fey]] under control.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|26}}

The adventurers were greeted by [[Eomar]], an Asgardian [[warrior]] and member of the [[Fated]], who went on to introduce them to Reglin and Titania. The Queen welcomed them to the plane on behalf of the Aesir, the Norse pantheon, leaving a shocked Reglin to choke from the statement. She then invited them to partake in the grand feast that Reglin had readied and expressed hope they would enjoy later festivities, which left Reglin concerned since he hadn't prepared anything.

After being in Gloamingard for some time, growing irritated from the fey, the adventurers watched as Queen Titania gathered the fey around her with a clap and expressed a desire for entertainment in the form of a series of contests between the mortals and fey. Unwilling to jeopardize the lives of his own men,{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|27}}

As the competition was coming to a close Gloamingard's copy of the ''[[Gjallarhorn]]'' sounded, warning of an incoming attack. Reglin jumped to his feet, brandishing his sword and shouting, "Foes come, let friends gather!".{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|28}} The eighty [[petitioner]]s in the hall, who had been dancing and singing with the fey, transformed into [[einheriar]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|30}}
