'''Tana Farag''' was a criminal in [[Heliogabalus]] as of the mid-14th century DR.The story is assumed to occur during the reign of Gareth Dragonsbane, as Pavel Shemov claims the king is "a paladin of Ilmater" and this happens prior to 1373. Gareth Dragonsbane rose to power in 1359 DR, with no other kings of Damara known to be such paladins of Ilmater. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the events of Silverfish occur during the 1360s DR.

==Description==
The woman was tall and thin, with brown hair, and a sorrowful face.

==Personality==
She had the habit of placing a naked dagger ahead of her. She believed in Kosef's cool-headedness over the evidence.

==Relationships==
She was quite loyal to Kosef Demsk.

==History==
In the early 1360s, Tana Farag called on [[Pavel Shemov]] to uncover evidence of Kosef's innocence, after the latter was arrested for the death of [[Mivar Greyman]], a jeweler.{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|42}} and in the ensuing interrogation, as well as the fight against the [[barghest]] that attacked them midway.{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|44}}

She fled once Iref Marsk died,{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|45}} but eagerly broke into Dor Stavask's home later, where she uncovered proof of his involvement in framing Kosef.{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|46}} She was caught after the fight with Dor, where she and Pavel killed the mage, but Pavel managed to cajole the magistrate into letting all of them go.{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|48}}

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said her loyalty to Kosef Demsk was because of a great favor or service he had done her before.
