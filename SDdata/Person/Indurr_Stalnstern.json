        "mainbody": "Indurr Stalnstern, nicknamed \"Warsword\", was a farmer in Red Larch circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. He was a former mercenary that retired and started a cattle ranch. He owned grazing land just north of the town off the Long Road. It could be reached by turning east at Nurnaths big chicken barn with the green-tile roof onto the cart track that led to Old Angraths Smokehouse. Indurrs pastures were on one side of the lane across from Mragan Gulthers orchards. The road ran for about a mile before dead-ending atop Angrath Drees hill."
