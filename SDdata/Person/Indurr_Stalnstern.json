        "mainbody": "'''Indurr Stalnstern''', nicknamed \"Warsword\", was a farmer in [[Red Larch]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He was a former mercenary that retired and started a cattle ranch. He owned grazing land just north of the town off the [[Long Road]]. It could be reached by turning east at [[Nurnath]]'s big chicken barn with the green-tile roof onto the cart track that led to [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]]. Indurr's pastures were on one side of the lane across from [[Mragan Gulther]]'s orchards. The road ran for about a mile before dead-ending atop [[Angrath Dree]]'s hill.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|84}}"
