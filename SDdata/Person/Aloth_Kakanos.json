        "mainbody": "Aloth Kakanos was a mage who worked within the Thayan enclave in the city of Proskur during the 14 century DR. Despite his choice of working arrangements, he was not an official member of the Red Wizards. Aloth was rarely found within the city, as he often undertook missions for the khazark of the enclave, Chathin Zurn."
