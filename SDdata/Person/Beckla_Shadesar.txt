Beckla Shadesar was a human wizard of Waterdeep in the early 14 century DR.
Around 1324 DR, Beckla took a job working for a moneylender in the South Ward of Waterdeep of the name Vermik.
In the , the young Lord Corin Silvertor was lost on a hunting trip into Undermountain below Waterdeep. The half-orc thief Artek Artalen was hired by Lord Darien Thal to rescue Lord Silvertor from Undermountain. With the help of Beckla, they located the young nobleman, and the three of them battled their way through Undermountain.
Becka was described as tall and sleek, with close-cropped brown hair and deep brown eyes. She was not considered pretty, as she had a square jaw and crooked nose. She wore worn leather breeches, a full white shirt, and a gray vest.
Beckla carried an intricately carved staff.
Beckla was a talented wizard, who wished only to expand her skills.
Beckla had warm feelings for Corin Silvertor, and was invited to join him as he returned to Waterdeep.
