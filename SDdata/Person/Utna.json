        "mainbody": "tna was a werewolf from the domain of Barovia, who lived during the Faer√ªnian 15 century DR.\nIn her human form, Utna had dusky skin and pale blonde hair. In her hybrid form she had pale gray fur.\nUtna was one to reason her way out of precarious situations and would not let her rage get the better of her.\nthumb|right|300px|Dron and Utna in their werewolf forms, in the Domain of Dread\nShe was part of the pack of werewolves led by Kiril Stoyanovich that laired within a network of caves near Lake Baratok. Utna was particularly close with her packmate Dron.\nSometime circa the 1480s DR, Utna, Dron, and the warlock Sangin were dispatched by Count Strahd to the world of Toril on the Prime Material plane to recover a specific magical item, one that they believed would allow them to leave their home of Barovia. The three interlopers briefly sought recover the relic for their own ends, to escape from Strahds domineering control.\nAfter tracking the relic to one of many in the temple of Kelemvor in Baldurs Gate, they abducted the cleric Nerys Kathon in order to determine the items authenticity. Their efforts were stopped by the Heroes of Baldurs Gate, a group of local adventurers. After a battle broke out between the two parties, everyone involved were transported back to Barovia by the mists of the Shadowfell and the will of Count Strahd.\nOnce back in the Domain of Dread, Sangin was taken away to Castle Ravenloft, while Utna and Dron were left to abandon the Torillians in the Domain of Dread. When Utna and Dron shrunk back to their pack leader Kiril, he was less than pleased. Even more disappointed in their efforts was Sangin, who had been transformed into a vampire by Strahds clan. Serving Strahd once again, the undead Sangin forced Kiril to order the death of either Utna or Dron as punishment. Kiril chose Dron and Utna was left alone and devastated.\nthumb|left|300px|Utna, about to claim her revenge on Sangin\nUtna was among a combined force of vampires and werewolves led by Sangin to seek out and destroy the errant Heroes of Baldurs Gate and recover Strahds lost relic,  an amulet that once belonged to his beloved Tatyana. After engaging in a second battle, the heroes gained the upper hand on the forces of darkness and Utna was given an opportunity for revenge. When Sangin was briefly distracted, Utna broke his neck and beheaded the undead warlock. Left with nothing else in her life, Utna stood defiantly against Strahds will, but was ultimately torn apart by a cloud of bats."
