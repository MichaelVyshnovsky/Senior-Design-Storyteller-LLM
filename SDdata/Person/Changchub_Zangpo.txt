'''Changchub Zangpo''' was the Sergeant of the Guard for [[Saikhoi]] in [[Ra-Khati]] during the mid–14th century [[DR]].

==Activities==
As with all of his fellow [[sohei]], Changchub was a fanatic while within the walls of Saikhoi, willing to give his life in defense of the city and its rulers. However, outside of Saikhoi, he was extremely superstitious and unpredictable.

==Abilities==
Changchub was a practicing [[sohei]]—a dangerous type of warrior-monk found in Ra-Khati. His skills included training in martial arts; weapons training; and minor spell-like abilities such as ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'', and ''[[hold person]]''.
