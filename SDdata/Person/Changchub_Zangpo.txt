Changchub Zangpo was the Sergeant of the Guard for Saikhoi in Ra-Khati during the mid–14th century DR.
As with all of his fellow sohei, Changchub was a fanatic while within the walls of Saikhoi, willing to give his life in defense of the city and its rulers. However, outside of Saikhoi, he was extremely superstitious and unpredictable.
Changchub was a practicing sohei—a dangerous type of warrior-monk found in Ra-Khati. His skills included training in martial arts weapons training and minor spell-like abilities such as detect magic, remove fear, and hold person.
