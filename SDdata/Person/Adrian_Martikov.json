        "History": "Some time ''circa'' the 1480s [[DR]] of the [[Faer√ªn]]ian calendar, Adrian was transporting a cart full of wine [[cask]]s when he was assaulted by a pack of [[ghoul]]s. Speeding away from the undead monsters, Adrian's speeding cart attracted the attention of the [[Toril]]lian adventurers known as the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] and he was saved from a rather grim death.\n\nIn a gesture of gratitude, he offered the adventurers lodging for the night, in the vineyard's stables, along with a free bottle of ''[[Red Dragon Crush]]''.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3}}"
