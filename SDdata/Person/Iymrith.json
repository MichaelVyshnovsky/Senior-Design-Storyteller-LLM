        "mainbody": "'''Iymrith''', also known as the '''Doom of the Desert''' and the '''Dragon of the Statues''', was a powerful [[blue dragon]] [[sorcerer]]",
        "Personality": "Iymrith was manipulative and cunning, as shown by her ongoing deception of [[Serissa]], daughter of the [[storm giant]] King [[Hekaton]], for an extended duration of time. \n\nLike many dragons, she was shown to be prideful and arrogant, unwilling to flee in battle or abandon her treasure to those that may lessen her wealth. As she aged, Iymrith grew to become less ferocious and more whimsical and thoughtful with her actions.",
        "Abilities": "Iymrith was an extremely talented [[shapechanger]], and could readily transform herself into her natural draconic form, or that of a massive storm giant. \n\nShe spent centuries studying [[magic]], and had a repertoire of rare and powerful spells such as ''[[flame sands]]'', well-suited for a blue dragon in the desert, and ''[[force burn]]'', one that was specifically created to harm the phaerimm. Using a unique form of the ''[[stone shape]]'' spell, Iymrith could transform stone into living [[gargoyle]]s, that continually grew her throng of stone-formed minions.",
        "Possessions": "Iymrith's hoard included a massive pile of [[gold]] coins that was protected by four [[air elemental]]s, each of which encompassed some thousands of coins within them as they formed. Her most valuable treasures, worth an amount totaling over 35,000 [[gp]], were stashed within five sarcophagi buried {{SI|10|ft}} beneath the floor of her lair. A sixth sarcophagus held the remains of the [[Netherese]] [[mummy lord]] [[Shaxan Kazraat]].",
        "Activities": "Iymrith tirelessly explored all ancient [[Netherese]] ruins in the [[Ascore]] area in search of [[magic]]. While in her lair, she was always protected by her scores of humanoid-gargoyle servants, She experimented often with new and dangerous [[spell]]s, sometimes with catastrophic results. Her research focused on the transference of her sentience from draconic body to body, in order to obtain a transcendent state of existence as a disembodied, mist-like flying spirit.\n\nBeyond her primary lair in Anauroch, she was known to keep maintain several caverns in the [[Greypeak Mountains|Greypeak]] and [[Sunset Mountains|Sunset Mountain]] ranges to the west. despite it falling under the lair of the powerful [[red dragon]] [[Klauth]].\n\nIn her later years, Iymrith took to rearing infant [[purple worm]]s in a nursery within her lair.",
        "Relationships": "Iymrith had two adult offspring, [[Anaxaster]] and [[Chezzaran]], each of whom laired in ruined Ascore. She expected greatness from her children, and was happy to lend them aid and resources to achieve it. \n\nShe was venerated by several groups that regularly made offerings to her honor, including the [[serpentfolk]] of [[Najara]] ''circa'' the late 14{{th}} century DR,",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "The first recorded appearance of Iymrith occurred in the {{YearlinkName|570}}, when she destroyed a [[Bedine]] camp. Soon after, she challenged an old dragon in the [[High Moor]] but was defeated. Iymrith crashed into some Netherese ruins in the [[Forgotten Forest]]. During her recuperation Iymrith somehow gained some powerful magical abilities beyond most blue dragons. The most convincing theory was that she had become the servant of an archmage who'd magically altered her body. Together, Iymrith and a skeletal figure raided villages and caravans in the Delimbiyr Vale and the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nAt some point in her past, Iymrith explored the ruins of Anorath in Anauroch when she first met the [[phaerimm]] and barely escaped with her life. Reeling from the attack, she started conducting experiments with some ancient and [[force burn|very rare spells]] she had discovered. When she was attacked by an adventuring company, Iymrith slew each member of the group, and used their bodies and started creating [[gargoyle]] servants. Armed with a small army, Iymrith continued her exploration into the ruins and discovered even more lost magic. The Doom of the Desert returned to the phaerimm she encountered before, destroyed the aberrant beings with her ''force burn'' spell and claimed the ruins as her new lair.",
            "14{{th}} Century DR": "Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Iymrith enslaved the adventurers of the [[Company of the Flame Spider]], treating them as her pets.\n\nLike many of her kind, Iymrith was not immune from the effects of the [[Rage of Dragons]] that overcame dragon-kind about a [[1373 DR|decade later]]. Enraged by the appearance of the [[King-Killer Star]], Iymrith flew north from her lair to [[Hartsvale]] in the [[Ice Spires]] and massacred three clans of [[giant]]s.",
            "15{{th}} Century DR": "At the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]], some time after the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Iymrith disguised herself as a giant and infiltrated the [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] citadel of the storm giants, becoming something of a mother figure for the princesses [[Mirran]], [[Nym (storm giant)|Nym]], and [[Serissa]]. Secretly, Iymrith encouraged Mirran and Nym to plot against her true mother [[Neri]], who appeared to prefer Serissa over her sisters. Iymrith sought to acquire the ''[[Wyrmskull Throne]]'' for herself and her treasure hoard.\n\nUsing the princesses as pawns and convincing them to ally with the [[Kraken Society]], Iymrith grew to great prominence within Maelstrom. She served as an advisor to princess-regent Serissa with the goal of starting a new war between [[giant]]s and the small folk, placing blame for Queen Neri's death on the [[Lords' Alliance]]. Along with her Kraken Society \"allies\", who operated with the permission of the ancient patron [[Slarkrethel]], Iymrith orchestrated the abduction of King Hekaton aboard the ''[[Morkoth (ship)|Morkorth]]'' in the [[Trackless Sea]], to ensure she had a failsafe in case her plan was thwarted.\n\n[[File:Iymrith.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Iymrith making a final stand in her lair.'']]\nIn order to glean more information about the activities of giants that may act against her, Iymrith went to the [[Eye of the All-Father]] shrine in the [[Spine of the World]]. She was met by the [[frost giant]] hero of [[Waterdeep]] [[Harshnag]], who fought off the blue wyrm as his small-folk allies made their way to safety. While it was unclear how the confrontation exactly played out, Iymrith returned to her lair in Anauroch. \n\nTo get their revenge for all the chaos Iymrith had caused, the monarch of the Storm Giants ventured across the desert to Iymrith's domain, protected by their four bodyguards [[Nimir]], [[Orlekto]], [[Shaldoor]], and [[Vaasha]], to confront the villainous dragon. While it was unknown if they traveled alongside one another, the same adventurers that had thwarted Iymrith twice before were also present."
