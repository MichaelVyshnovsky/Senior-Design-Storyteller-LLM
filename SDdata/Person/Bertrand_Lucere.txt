Bertrand Lucere was a merchant in Luskan during the late 15 century DR. 
A merchant noted for his business ethics, Bertrand had worked his way up building a business that traded in lumber and iron. In the 1480s DR, however, he moved into specialty goods like rare herbs and minerals with alchemical properties used in potion-making. He met often with many of the towns merchants.
He had a daughter, Indra Lucere, to whom he left a substantial inheritance.
Some time around 1490 DR, Bertrand was murdered, his throat slit, in the entry hall of his home. He was found by his daughter Indra. A select few valuables of his most recent shipment, among them various bits of jewellery, was stolen, and his daughters fianc√© Edwin went missing.
