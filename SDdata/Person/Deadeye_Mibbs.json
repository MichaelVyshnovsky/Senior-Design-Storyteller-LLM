        "Description": "\"Deadeye\" was a [[human]] man with light skin, light brown eyes eyes, and brown wavy hair. He wore a uniform of the Flaming Fist – a set of [[Leather armor|leathers]] adorned with the Flaming Fist insignia, typical for [[crossbow]]men of the organization.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, \"Deadeye\" Mibbs was stationed just outside one of the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]]. His and the fellow Fists' job was stopping rabble from entering the Upper City, allowing only those with much [[coin]] through. The Fists managed a slow-moving queue of rich and poor – city folk trying to return home or just find safety behind the second set of walls."
