'''Atenas Swift''' was the proprietor of [[Frozenfar Expeditions]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had medium-brown skin and gray hair.

==Activities==
In his younger years, Atenas made many expeditions across [[Icewind Dale]], having traversed such treacherous features as [[Kelvin's Cairn]], the [[Spine of the World]] mountains, and even the [[Reghed Glacier]].

As of the 1490s [[DR]], Atenas was quite elderly, and did not have the fortitude to make regular forays into the cold lands of the [[Frozenfar]].

==Relationships==
Atenas was aided in his business by the experienced [[dwarven]] mountaineer [[Jartha Farzassh]].

He also had a dozen sled [[dog]]s, whom he housed in a kennel next to his shop.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Atenas encountered [[Garret Velryn]] at his shop, shortly before the latter outdoorsman disappeared at Kelvin's Cairn.
