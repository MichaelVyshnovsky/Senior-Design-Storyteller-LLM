Atenas Swift was the proprietor of Frozenfar Expeditions during the late 15 century DR.
He had medium-brown skin and gray hair.
In his younger years, Atenas made many expeditions across Icewind Dale, having traversed such treacherous features as Kelvins Cairn, the Spine of the World mountains, and even the Reghed Glacier.
As of the 1490s DR, Atenas was quite elderly, and did not have the fortitude to make regular forays into the cold lands of the Frozenfar.
Atenas was aided in his business by the experienced dwarven mountaineer Jartha Farzassh.
He also had a dozen sled dogs, whom he housed in a kennel next to his shop.
In the , Atenas encountered Garret Velryn at his shop, shortly before the latter outdoorsman disappeared at Kelvins Cairn.
