Baron Pundar was a minor ruler of a small barony in Tethyr during the Interregnum&mdashalthough this was contested.
Pundar chose the half-ogre Togrev as "lord high commander" of his "armed forces".
Little is known about Pundar, except that he claimed to have had an "ancient right" to certain lands within County Morninggold. This was attested to, in writing, by the government of Zazesspur that was briefly in place in the .
In the spring of that year, when the countess of Morninggold, Zaranda Star, journeyed from her castle to the city of Zazesspur to sell loot acquired in Thay, she encountered a band of bandits who were raiding farmhouses and killing peasants. They claimed to be collecting taxes for Baron Pundar. Zaranda refuted Pundars claims, insisting that she was countess of the region and that there was no true capital of Tethyr at the time with the authority to appoint barons.
