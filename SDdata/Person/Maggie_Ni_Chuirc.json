She wore a helmet and a set of mundane chainmail armor. In battle, the wielded a spear and a tower shield adorned with the insignia of the Flaming Fist.\nIn the , the Dead Eyes set out to perform a job that would end up setting the gang against the Guild and its leader, Ninefingers. Maggies sister, Aideen, worked with a local criminal not affiliated with the Guild, Brinks, to pull the heist off. The Guild did not take competition lightly and sent thugs to take care of the Dead Eyes. Her band survived and relocated to a new lair. Unbeknownst to Aideen, one of her men was a traitor. Bard Hiero Lue uncovered the secret stash where Aideen hid the loot, including the Guilds coin, and sent a note to Ninefingers, informing the Guild of the Dead Eyes lair and the hidden stashs location. The hiding spot was unknown to even Aideens own sister, which made Maggie furious when she discovered the bard found out her sisters secret. Maggie wanted to kill the bard but reported him to Aideen, who, in turn, stated that once the job was done, she would end Hiero Lue herself. Maggie did not like the idea of keeping the bard alive that long but conceded that her sister knew better as the groups leader. It was unknown if Maggie and the Dead Eyes survived an attack from the Guild or other eager adventurers of Baldurs Gate."
