{{Quote|Ever tried cuttin' up an [[elf]]? All skin an' bones, the rangy gits. My arm's gonna be sore tomorrow.|Zurk.}}

==Activities==
Zurk was responsible for caring for the [[worg]]s that were kept by within the lower reaches of the ruined temple of [[Sel√ªne]] where he and his fellow goblins made camp. Working with Butcher [[Vrak]], he fed them the remains of the people the goblins killed during their raids.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zurk also had to keep imprisoned a mighty [[bear]] that was in fact the [[druid]] [[Halsin]] in his animal form. He performed his duties well, letting goblin children throw rocks at the great beast.
