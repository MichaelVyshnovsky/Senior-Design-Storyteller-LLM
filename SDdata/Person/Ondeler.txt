Ondeler was a Zhentarim wizard in Battledale.
Ondeler was famous for losing many Zhent soldiers in fruitless expeditions.
In 1358 DR, Ondeler led a Zhent garrison in Essembra together with the Zhentilar commander Amglar. Secretly Amglar was under orders to report regularly to Draethe, steward of the Inner Circle, on the wizards performance. At one point, however they were attacked by some mysterious undead. Amglar reported the news to Ondeler, who gathered his apprentice Myarvuk and Belurastra Stormfall, Ondelers envoy among the Dalesfolk.
However, Belurastra revealed herself as a malaugrym and made an agreement with Amglar while at the same time killing Ondeler.
