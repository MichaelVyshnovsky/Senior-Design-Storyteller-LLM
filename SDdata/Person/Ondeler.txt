'''Ondeler''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] in [[Battledale]].

==History==
Ondeler was famous for losing many Zhent soldiers in fruitless expeditions.

In [[1358 DR]], Ondeler led a Zhent garrison in [[Essembra]] together with the [[Zhentilar]] commander [[Amglar]]. Secretly Amglar was under orders to report regularly to [[Draethe]], steward of the Inner Circle, on the wizard's performance. At one point, however they were attacked by some mysterious [[undead]]. Amglar reported the news to Ondeler, who gathered his apprentice [[Myarvuk]] and [[Belurastra Stormfall]], Ondeler's envoy among the Dalesfolk.

However, Belurastra revealed herself as a [[malaugrym]] and made an agreement with Amglar while at the same time killing Ondeler.
