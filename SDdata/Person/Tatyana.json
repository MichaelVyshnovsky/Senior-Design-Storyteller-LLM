        "mainbody": "'''Tatyana''' was a young [[Barovia]]n woman. When count [[Strahd von Zarovich]] fell desperately in love with her, his unrequited obsession drove him to seal a pact with the [[Dark Powers]], turning him into a [[vampire]] and plunging the entire valley into the [[Domains of Dread]].",
        "Description": "Tatyana was extraordinarily beautiful.",
        "History": "Originally a peasant woman from the village of Barovia, Tatyana was in love with and engaged to marry [[Sergei von Zarovich|Sergei]], Strahd's brother. However, Strahd fell madly in love with Tatyana immediately upon seeing her. Strahd's pride prevented him from voicing his feelings until their wedding day, when he killed his brother and drank his blood as part of a deal with the Dark Powers to make Tatyana his bride. Horrified by what Strahd had done, Tatyana jumped from the cliff that overlooked the valley below [[Castle Ravenloft]].\n\nAs part of the deal made with the Dark Powers, Strahd was not allowed to die, rising as a vampire after being shot by the castle's guards.\n\nSometime before the {{YearlinkName|1072}}, a fragment of Tatyana's soul managed to escape her prison in Barovia and found its way to [[Waterdeep]], taking the form of Anna, an incurably insane woman who had been locked up in an asylum. There, she was found by the vampire [[Jander Sunstar]], who fell in love with her and took care of the traumatized woman.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Tatyana reincarnated again as [[Ireena Kolyana]]."
