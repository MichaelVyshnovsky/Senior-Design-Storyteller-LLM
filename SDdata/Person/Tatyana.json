However, Strahd fell madly in love with Tatyana immediately upon seeing her. Strahds pride prevented him from voicing his feelings until their wedding day, when he killed his brother and drank his blood as part of a deal with the Dark Powers to make Tatyana his bride. Horrified by what Strahd had done, Tatyana jumped from the cliff that overlooked the valley below Castle Ravenloft.\nAs part of the deal made with the Dark Powers, Strahd was not allowed to die, rising as a vampire after being shot by the castles guards.\nSometime before the , a fragment of Tatyanas soul managed to escape her prison in Barovia and found its way to Waterdeep, taking the form of Anna, an incurably insane woman who had been locked up in an asylum. There, she was found by the vampire Jander Sunstar, who fell in love with her and took care of the traumatized woman.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Tatyana reincarnated again as Ireena Kolyana."
