        "History": "Slim was a wererat fighter member of Ship Rethnor in [[Luskan]]. He and his friend [[Marek the Shank]] were the main leaders of the Rethnor men that followed [[Vaelish Gant]] in Icewind Dale. They started a protection racket in [[Bryn Shander]] and supported Vaelish in his political plot.\n\nSlim stole animals from [[Aglonell]]'s traps on [[Eleint 6]]. Some days later, Slim and Marek stole [[silver]] weapons ordered by the [[Harper]] [[Aarun]] from [[Dunavan]]'s warehouse. On [[Highharvestide]], Silm and Marek kidnapped the Speaker of Bryn Shander, [[Duvessa Shane]], on the day of an election and Vaelish proposed himself as substitute, pretending to appear reluctant."
