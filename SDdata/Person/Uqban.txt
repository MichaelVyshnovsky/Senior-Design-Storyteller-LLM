Most Holy Regent Uqban min Najm was the regent of Hafayah within the Free Cities of Zakhara in .
Uqban was an ethoist priest of Najm, the Zakharan god of adventure and curiosity.
He was the vizier of Prince Saba during a time of great upheaval when the Sultan of Hafayah was poisoned, resulting in a brief factional war within the city that left all of Sabas older brothers and sisters dead. Fearing for his wards safety, Uqban fled the city to avoid the bloodshed. He returned several weeks later and the factions recognized Saba as the future Sultan in order to prevent a fleet of mamluks from Qudra from arriving to assert their agenda on the city. Uqban was also recognized as Hafayahs regent until Prince Saba came of age. As Regent, Uqban did not let court officials become too comfortable in their positions. He usually dismissed, demoted, or arrested them at the first mistake in order to keep them in line.
