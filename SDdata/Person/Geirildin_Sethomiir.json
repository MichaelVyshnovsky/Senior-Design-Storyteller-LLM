He was a [[dark elf]] and powerful mage during the time of the [[Crown Wars]].\n\nHe summoned the [[balor]] [[Wendonai]] in {{Yearlink|-11500}} to help him against the [[Aryvandaar]]i and to help him in achieving a leading position among the other dark elven clans. Ultimately, this drove the dark elves into the arms of [[Lolth]] and was one of the causes for their so-called Descent."
