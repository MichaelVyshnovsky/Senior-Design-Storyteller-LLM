        "mainbody": "He arrived in town without warning only a day or two before the ceremony and with a company of twenty samurai of the shogun's personal guard, led by Zukimoto. Hiro himself rode in a [[palanquin]] carried by four bearers. Hiro stayed at the daimyo's [[donjon (Aru)|donjon]] in the Castle District. Finally, the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps went ahead, with Hiro, Benju, and their advisors and family in attendance. It was interrupted when the [[Yamaguchi]] [[ninja]]—who were meant to attack and disrupt the procession, so [[Eichiro Tanaka]], mastermind behind them could step in with his forces and defeat them, thus discrediting Benju—instead surprised and betrayed Eichiro and his samurai, revealing the scheme to Hiro. Although surprised by all this, Hiro reviewed the evidence and convicted Eichiro on the spot. Desperate, Eichiro attacked Hiro Matsu, and was defeated by adventurers in Benju's service.",

        "Activities": "Hiro Matsu was a member of the personal staff of the shogun, [[Matasuuri Nagahide]], and served as his inspector. In this capacity, he traveled the country.\n\nWhile his duties were mostly ceremonial, Hiro kept up his combat training to a high degree.",
