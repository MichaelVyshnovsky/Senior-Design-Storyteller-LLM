        "mainbody": "Lady '''Lucia Thione-Hhune''' was a female [[human]] who went on to become a member of the Shield Council of the [[Knights of the Shield]], due in part to her being the wife of [[Inselm Hhune]], the Duke of [[Kamlann]] and the First Lord of the Shield.",
        "Description": "Lucia was a pretty, chestnut-haired lady,",
        "Activities": "In addition to being duchess-consort of Kamlann, Lucia was one of eight Councilors of the city of [[Zazesspur]], representing the Ships District (though her manor was in the Garden District She was also second-in-command of the Shippers' Guild of Zazesspur.",
        "History": "Lucia was a distant cousin of the [[Tethyr]]ian royal family and was very young when she entered the [[Knights of the Shield]]. Lucia had been a long-time resident of [[Waterdeep]] and joined the Shield Council of the Knights of the Shield when she convinced that group that she was a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord]] of that city. She was expelled from the Shield Council after the [[Harper]] [[Danilo Thann]] and the rogue [[elf]] [[Elaith Craulnober]] foiled her attempt to overthrow the Lords of Waterdeep in [[1364 DR]] and her lie about her status was discovered.\n\nShe managed to regain some respect among her fellow Knights and, for political reasons, decided to marry Inselm Hhune in [[1369 DR]]. By [[1372 DR]], her husband had allowed her to take back her lost seat on the Shield Council; Inselm, however, appointed her not for love or duty but only because he thought that Lucia would easily accept the faith of [[Gargauth]] and help him in his crusade.",
        "Relationships": "Lucia worked closely with a [[half-elf]] and former Harper named [[Iriador Wintermist|Garnet]] in her attempt to take over Waterdeep but shed no tears when Garnet was abducted by the [[green dragon]] [[Grimnoshtadrano]].<ref>\n\nLucia for her part had never loved Inselm, and the only reason for their marriage was her chance to become a duchess of Tethyr and regain her lost status within the Knights' ranks. Her husband was under no illusions in regard to his wife's motivations either, and neither expected the other to remain faithful.\n\nLucia also had an estranged daughter, [[Isabeau Thione]], but the two avoided each other."
