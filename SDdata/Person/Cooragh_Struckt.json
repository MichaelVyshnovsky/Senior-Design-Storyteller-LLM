        "mainbody": "'''Cooragh Struckt''' was the [[half-orc]] cook of the [[Wayside Inn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Tattoos of curving daggers could be found on Cooragh's neck, beneath each ear. She got them in her adolescent years to annoy her mother, a Luskan [[human]].\n\nCooragh was known for her delectable stews and meat pies, which were notoriously spicy.",
        "Relationships": "Cooragh was a long-time companion of [[Martisha Vinetalker]], the owner of the inn.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Wayside Inn was attacked by [[undead]] that had been created by a cult of [[Myrkul]]. A group of [[adventurer]]s was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.\n\nLater, the cult of [[Talos]] led by [[Fheralai Stormsworn]] took over the inn. The guests of the inn were impaled as sacrifices to the Stormbringer. The cultists tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos and summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn in the process. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able stop the ritual in time. However, the Talos cultists successfully kidnapped [[Tarbin Tul]], a local bard."
