Portia Dzuth was an adventurer in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
In 1492 DR, Portia and her party were hired by Lady Wylynd Moonstar of Waterdeep to find Umbraxakar the shadow dragon and transform him back into Glyster. However, she and her companions were captured by the Dark Army of the Night and Portia was enthralled by Keresta Delvingstone. Afterward Keresta used her as human shield and source of food for her vampire spawns.
Portia started to suffer the despair of the Shadowfell, believing shed been imprisoned inside Vanrakdoom for a very long time. She thought that to redeem Umraxakar it was necessary to rid the dragon of despair but had no idea how.
Under her charm spell, Portia believed Keresta to be a trusted friend.
