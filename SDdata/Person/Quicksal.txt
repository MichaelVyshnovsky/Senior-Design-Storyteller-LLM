Quicksal was a particularly malicious thief that lived in Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He had a narrow face like that of a hawk, with thin golden-blonde that was often left quite dirty.
Quicksal took great pleasure in killing the people that he robbed. He often disguised himself using wigs and other items, creating garish characters that would be the last images his victims would see.
When he was a teenager, Quicksal was an acquaintance of his fellow Zhent thief Cyric.
