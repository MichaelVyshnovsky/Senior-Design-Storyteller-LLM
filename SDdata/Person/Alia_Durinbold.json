        "mainbody": "Lady '''Alia Durinbold''' was a senior member of the noble [[patriar]] [[Durinbold]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], presumably by marriage, and a member of the [[Parliament of Peers]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You'll remember this day. History's been made, in this very fortress.''|Lady Alia Durinbold}}",
        "Description": "Alia Durinbold was a [[wood elven]] woman with a pale skin tone and blue eyes. She wore her hair, color of dirty blonde, in two short braids. Alia wore a diadem, a jewelweed coronet, and a long navy blue gown embroidered in gold. Lady Durinbold accentuated her eyes with golden metallic [[makeup]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, shortly before the armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lady Alia Durinbold was a Parliamentarian of the Gate and voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the city's Archduke. Lady Durinbold was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of [[Wyrm's Rock]]. Following the coronation, Lady Durinbold expressed her support of Enver Gortash as she trusted Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]]'s judgement. Unbeknownst to her, Ravengard's actions were influenced by an altered [[illithid]] tadpole and enthrallments by the [[Cult of the Absolute]]."
