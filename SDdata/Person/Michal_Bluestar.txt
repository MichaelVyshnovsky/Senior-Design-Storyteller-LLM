Michal Bluestar was an elven ajami crewman on the pirate vessel Leap for the Throat in 1367 DR.
Michal added his magical power to the raids committed by Almari bint-Kafira and her pirate fleet.
Michal initially came to Zakhara on a foreign trading ship. While sailing the waters of Suq Bay, the merchants were accosted by Almari and her pirates. Michal noticed the shoddy artistry on the pirate flag and, defiant to Almaris authority, yelled out that she was the "Dreaded Porpoise." Impressed with his bravery, Almari offered to spare Michals life if he agreed to design a new flag for her. Michal agreed and became one of Almaris crewmembers since that time.
