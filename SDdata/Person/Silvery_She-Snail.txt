The '''"Silvery She-Snail"''' was the stage-name of a famous nightclub dancer of [[Sembia]].

==History==
Her act was quite successful, thanks in part to a number of flying [[illusion]] spells developed by an [[archmage]]. This mage, powerful and reclusive, became so infatuated with the She-Snail that he kidnapped her. But he wooed her successfully and she retired sometime in the early 1360s [[DR]] to marry him.

The [[Silvery Sembian Snail]] tavern in [[Wheloon]], [[Cormyr]], was named after the Silvery She-Snail.
