        "Description": "Kagha had ginger hair, which was tied up in an elaborate manner. She wore [[leather armor]] and fought with an array of [[spell]]s, a [[dagger]], and a [[scimitar]]. She also carried a [[chicken]] and a key.",
        "Possessions": "She owned an enchanted amulet called ''[[Broodmother's Revenge]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Kagha had a close bond with many animals of the grove, particularly the [[viper]], [[Teela]].\n\nShe had ties to [[Aelis|Archdruid Aelis]] and the order known as the [[Shadow Druids]].",
        "History": "When the grove was founded, the druids forced hordes of creature, such as [[goblins]], from the land. However in 1490s DR, they came back after being influenced by [[the Absolute]], and other beings flocked to the grove, particularly [[tieflings]]. The goblins of the Absolute seized the First Druid, Master [[Halsin]], and Kagha took over in his place, but had very little tolerance for their kind. \n\nOne of the young tieflings that came to the grove, [[Arabella]], stole the ''[[Idol of Silvanus]]''. Kagha captured the young tiefling thief and had her viper watch over her. She then instructed the druids of the grove to perform the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'' to protect their sacred home from other outsiders. In truth she sought to take over as leader of the grove and rededicate it to serve the Shadow Druids."
