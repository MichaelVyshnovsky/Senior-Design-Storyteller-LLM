'''Nuldrevyn Talendar''' was the patriarch of the [[Talendar]] family in [[Selgaunt]].{{Cite dragon/283/Rogues Gallery: The Foes of Stormweather|86-91}}

==Relationships==
In youth, Nuldrevyn was always in the company of his brother [[Marance Talendar]].

==History==
Nuldrevyn with Marance fought [[orc]]s, brigands, and pirates and rival houses around [[1250 DR]]. The House's rivalries led to a clandestine war with [[Thamalon Uskevren]]. However, Thamalon killed Marance and Nuldrevyn remained shocked.

In time, he became a frail old man, always cautious and conservative in the family's businesses but never forgotten.

When Marance came back from the [[Nine Hells]] in [[1372 DR]], Nuldrevyn gave his blessing to his vengeance against the [[Uskevren]].

==Personality==
Nuldrevyn was an old codger on the surface but deep inside was a ruthless individual to protect his family. He was proud of his many children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews, in particular his son [[Ossian Talendar]]. Secretly he greatly feared snakes.
