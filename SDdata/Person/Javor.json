        "mainbody": "'''Javor''' was an old chieftain of the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.",
        "History": "In life, Javor was a great Uthgardt chieftain. His remains were buried in a mound near the [[Nettlebee]] ranch.\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], [[Wiggan Nettlebee|Wiggan]] and [[Bertram Nettlebee]], under the orders of [[Cult of the Black Earth]] leaders, set a trap for some adventurers who had defeated the earth cultists at the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]. They burnt Javor's mound, attracting the adventurers with rumors of a \"fire witch\" in their fields.\n\nWhen the adventurers came to investigate the mound, Wiggan summoned an [[earth elemental]] to destroy the mound and kill all inside. However, this awoke Javor. Javor rose as a [[revenant]] wanting revenge against Wiggan and Bertram. He was helped by an Uthgardt war group led by the berserker [[Fennor]]. Somehow the adventurers resolved the situation and Javor went back to the [[afterlife]].",
        "Personality": "Javor was an honorable man, even in [[undead|undeath]]. He tried to find and kill only the true culprits, but had no mercy for those that protected them."
