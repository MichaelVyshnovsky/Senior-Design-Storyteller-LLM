Kaummorth was a figure known to the Zhentarim of the mid-14 century DR.
Two Zhentarim mages, Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle discussed Kaummorth while procrastinating on some work for Drauthtar Inskirl. He had made a speech whose gist, per Hlael, was akin to "Smile and walk softly and be greatly feared", emphasizing intimidation over violence.
