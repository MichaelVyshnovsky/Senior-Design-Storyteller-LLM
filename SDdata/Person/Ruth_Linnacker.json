        "mainbody": "Lady '''Ruth Linnacker''' was an aged member of the [[Parliament of Peers]] from the noble [[patriar]] [[Linnacker]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Archduke Gortash, man of the people. The right people.''|Lady Ruth Linnacker}}",
        "Description": "Ruth Linnacker was an aging [[human]] woman with a dark skin tone. Her long finely-braided hair was bleached by the woman's advancing age. She wore embroidered finery â€“ a long teal gambeson.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lady Ruth Linnacker was already a member of the Parliament of Peers. When the [[Absolute crisis]] arrived at the Gate, Ruth was noted by the [[Cult of Bane]] as one of the eight top patriars of the Parliament, vulnerable to bribery, blackmail, or direct threats. Lady Linnacker became a target of the cult when a large amount of payments from the family's [[Tethyr]]ian [[gem]] mines was made public. Her granddaughter, [[Fariza Linnacker]], was to be captured and held hostage in the [[Upper City]] until Ruth compiled with the Baneites' demands.\n\nThe stunt was an apparent successes as Lady Linnacker voted to crown the lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the Gate's Archduke. She was present at the [[Wyrm's Rock]] fortress, along with her fellow Parliamentarians during the coronation. Publicly, Ruth proclaimed Gortash as being a man of the people."
