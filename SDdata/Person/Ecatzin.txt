'''Ecatzin''' was a [[couatl]] follower of [[Ubtao]] in [[Chult]] and [[Katashaka]] in the early 3{{rd}} millennium before [[Dale Reckoning]].

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-3000}}, the couatls of Chult were dwindling in number and desired to halt the spread of the [[yuan-ti]] into the western end of the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Searching for another people to take their place, the winged serpents eventually chose the [[human]]s of Katashaka, and went to them to preach of their god, [[Ubtao]].

Ecatzin came to the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] tribe and spoke of Ubtao. Although initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of the perfidious [[Akongo]], some of the tribe gradually came to accept the couatl's words. Ecatzin taught them a little of its language, and even instructed a chosen few like [[Oyai]] in a forbidden [[magic]] called ''matumbe''.

After Oyai used ''matumbe'' to seal [[the Sleeper]] who tyrannized the Tabaxi, Ecatzin named the liberated Tabaxi as Ubtao's blessed children.<ref name=TGHotR-29-30/> Soon after, in {{Yearlink|-2809}}, Ecatzin and Oyai led the peoples of the Tabaxi, [[Eshowe]], [[Thinguth]], and several others who'd accepted the faith of Ubtao to go with the couatls in a great pilgrimage over the ocean in some 300 ''canoa'' (canoes). Landing on the Wild Coast, they journeyed into the Jungles of Chult and met their new god at the [[Peaks of Flame]].
