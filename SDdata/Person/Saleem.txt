Saleem was an eccentric human architect who lived in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Though an accomplished builder in his own right, Saleem was both modest and calm when he went about his work. Those who knew him said he had a great sense of humor.
Saleem was always accompanied by Lab, a she-mule companion with whom he carried-on deep one-way conversations. Many who witnessed these interactions believed Saleem to be mad, but others believed that Lab was a polymorphed lover or even a genie companion who inspired Saleems architectural designs.
