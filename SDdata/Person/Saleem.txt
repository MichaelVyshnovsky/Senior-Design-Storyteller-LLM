'''Saleem''' was an eccentric [[human]] [[architect]] who lived in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Though an accomplished builder in his own right, Saleem was both modest and calm when he went about his work. Those who knew him said he had a great sense of humor.

==Relationships==
Saleem was always accompanied by [[Lab]], a she-mule companion with whom he carried-on deep one-way conversations. Many who witnessed these interactions believed Saleem to be mad, but others believed that Lab was a ''[[Polymorph|polymorphed]]'' lover or even a [[genie]] companion who inspired Saleem's architectural designs.
