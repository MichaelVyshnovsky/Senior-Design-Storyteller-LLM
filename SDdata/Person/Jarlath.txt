'''Jarlath''' was a laborer, packer, and a delivery man of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette'' in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''No time to chat, mate, sorry. Since Gortash donated this printing machine, we've had ridiculous volume to shift.''|Jarlath}}

==Description==
Jarlath was a pale-skinned [[gold dwarven]] man with deep brown eyes and a goatee in place of a more traditional beard and slicked back hair. He had an extremely thick neck and muscled body.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Jarlath was employed by Baldur's Mouth and could be found outside the [[broadsheet]] publisher's office packing up deliveries of fresh issues. The man was a busy diligent worker who lamented dramatically increased work load after a gift of an [[enchanted]] [[printing press]] to the broadsheet's editor-in-chief.
