'''Chall''' was a [[drow]] [[sorcerer]] in [[Cormanthor]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
Around [[1372 DR]], Chall, [[Varzek]], and six other warriors settled in Cormanthor.

In 1373 DR, Varzek's team went to explore the ruined tower of [[Talarith]] near the [[Moonsea]] area. However, the tower's wards repelled drow so they were forced to search for additional allies in order to enter the tower.
