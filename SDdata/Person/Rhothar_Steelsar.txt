'''Rhothar Steelsar''' was an unfortunate child of the exiled [[Amn]]ian [[Parhek]] dynasty.

==Relationships==
Rhothar was the child of Princess [[Rasa Parhek]] [[Dornar Steelsar]], and was the youngest sibling of [[Choris Steelsar|Choris]], [[Rosa Steelsar|Rosa]], and [[Rohav Steelsar|Rohav]].

Rhothar was born in [[Silverymoon]], and was only 7 years old in the {{YearlinkName|1297}} when the family was found and attacked by assassins from Amn. Dornar and Choris fought to the death, Rohav was kidnapped, and Rosa was killed, but Rasa and Rhothar managed to escape. He was believed to have died five years later in [[1302 DR]].
