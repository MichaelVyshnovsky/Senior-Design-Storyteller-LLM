        "mainbody": "Torga Burduum was a highly accomplished dwarven master smith from Citadel Adbar who dedicated her life and unlife to honing her art and creating powerful magical items such as Torgas Pyre.\nTorga Burduum was dedicated to smithing and went across the world and reached for the planes in search of materials and skills to improve herself. She strove to create a legendary weapon that would live on forever and achieve greatness in the hands of a grand hero or a dread villain.\nTorga Burduum hailed from the ancient dwarven Citadel Adbar. It was there she developed her impressive skills and reached the status of a Master Smith. She assembled a group of loyal apprentices and ventured across the world searching for new skills, techniques, and materials to create even more powerful weapons that would be legendary. Failing to find something powerful enough to use in her craft, she turned to the arcane, searching for materials and inspiration from the planes.\nEventually, Torga and her group reached Izzaxus Kiln in the Forlorn Cliffs of the Middledark, the ancient abandoned site of countless drow summoning rituals. There, Toga uncovered arcane texts describing a creature called Izzaxu, who was forged out of a fire elemental and was bound to the Kiln. Foolishly, Toga and her group broke the seals that were holding the elemental, thinking they would be able to control the creature. Izzaxu was too powerful for the dwarves and incinerated the dwarves as it exited the portal. Those who avoided the infernal flames fled through the caves, triggering the traps left behind by the drow, and met their doom after being trapped inside Izzaxus Kiln.\nAlongside her crew, she remained trapped inside the Kiln in the ghostly apparition form until Champion of the Burning Dawns arrival circa 1490 DR. Torga greeted the heroes after telling them that she has lost all hope of salvation, feeling like the whole cavern was lost in time. She employed the Champion to help the ghostly dwarves to break the curse of their existence by defeating Izzaxu and finishing her greatest workâ€”Torgas Pyre. The Champion and the companions were able to defeat the elemental creature, allowing Torga Burduum to harness Izzaxus heat and essence into her masterpiece. With their purpose fulfilled, the ghosts departed for the afterlife."
