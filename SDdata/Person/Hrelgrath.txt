Hrelgrath was one of the dreadspells sent with Elryn to find and slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the . During the first leg of the trip, he had Uldus Blackram lead the way, while holding a knife to the mans back. During the first leg of their trip, Uldus Blackram was killed by Ilbryn Starym, an elven wizard they chanced upon.
Once they found the ruin, Karsus Keep, Hrelgrath helped loot it of valuables. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.
