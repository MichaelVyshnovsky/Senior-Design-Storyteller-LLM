        "mainbody": "'''Ascodel''' was one of the many consorts of Queen [[Morwel]] of the [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]]. and the [[Gates of the Moon]].",
        "History": "In the days when the eladrin forces had almost annihilated the [[obyrith]]s from the [[Abyss]], [[Pale Night]] devised a plan of revenge. It is not clear exactly how, but she somehow used Ascodel's concern for the children of the eladrin people to force him into making a pact, which—unbeknownst to him—condemned thousands of eladrin children to eternity trapped on the 471{{st}} [[Layers of the Abyss|layer of the Abyss]], [[Androlynne]]. A host of [[celestial]]s immediately came to the aid of the trapped, perpetually young eladrin children. In one of the wars that followed, Ascodel gave his life defending the ones that he accidentally betrayed."
