Dhadius the Scarlet was a human wizard of the late 15th century DR.
Dhadius was an older male with dark skin and brown eyes. He had a long grey hair where he had not gone bald, and sported a similarly grey beard and mustache. He wore a red robe with golden embroidery.
Dhadius was an arrogant wizard, and considered all others to be below him in intellect. He spent much of his time searching for esoteric knowledge simply to know things that common people could not. Dhadius thought of himself as a legendary wizard.
Dhadius wielded a long wooden staff that had a large, round red gem set on top.
Dhadius lived in Luskan, where he joined the Arcane Brotherhood in his later years. The other members did not take him as seriously as he thought he should be taken. He was determined to prove to them and the world that he should be respected and feared.
