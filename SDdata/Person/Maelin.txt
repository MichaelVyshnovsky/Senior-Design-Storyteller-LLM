'''Maelin''' was the fiery daughter of [[Talbot Uskevren]]'s valet, [[Eckert]].

Sometime in the winter between [[1370 DR|1370]] and [[1371 DR]], she was kidnapped by [[Radu Malveen]], who held her in the [[Malveen]]s' former home. Guarded by Radu's [[vampire]] brother, [[Stannis Malveen|Stannis]], she was kept for months while Radu ransomed Eckert's knowledge of the [[Uskevren]]s for his daughter's life.

She was rescued by Talbot, [[Chaney Foxmantle]], [[Darrow]], and [[Feena Archwood]] in [[Tarsakh]] of 1371 DR, though Chaney lost his life in the process.<ref>
