Maelin was the fiery daughter of Talbot Uskevrens valet, Eckert.
Sometime in the winter between 1370 and 1371 DR, she was kidnapped by Radu Malveen, who held her in the Malveens former home. Guarded by Radus vampire brother, Stannis, she was kept for months while Radu ransomed Eckerts knowledge of the Uskevrens for his daughters life.
She was rescued by Talbot, Chaney Foxmantle, Darrow, and Feena Archwood in Tarsakh of 1371 DR, though Chaney lost his life in the process.
