Jorun Tamewater was an elderly but strong dwarven shipwright and engineer who worked in Targos in the early 14 century DR.
Jorun was a pale-skinned dwarf. He wore a set of leather armor and was armed with a warhammer.
Jorun Tamewaters home stood at the bottom of the cliffs to the south-west of the docks. At the time of the goblin attack, the dwarf rigged one of his chests with a stinking cloud for any unwitting thieves.
Jorun had a strained and argumentative relationship with Lumbar Grundwall, a lumber merchant in Targos. After a fight in 1312 DR, the two stopped talking with each other.
In the , the town of Targos was besieged by a goblin army that served the Legion of the Chimera. As an engineer, Jorun Tamewater and his son Olap constructed a crane to transport lumber up the cliff from Targos docks to the outskirts of the town for defensive palisades. In addition to being imported from Lonelywood and stripped from wooden buildings, some of the lumber came from the ships Jorun had built. When goblins commenced a surprise attack on the docks, Jorun Tamewater caught several "rock-crawlers" trying to set fire to his ships in the harbor. Furious, the dwarf attacked the invaders and caved numerous goblin skulls in.
Shortly after, a group of adventurers from Luskan met the shipbuilder, who shared an important observation â€“ the goblins did not jump the palisades and carried pickaxes, indicating that they had found a way into Targos through an underground passage.
