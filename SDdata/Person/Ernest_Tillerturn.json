        "mainbody": "ady Ernest Tillerturn was a patriar of Baldurs Gate sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.\nErnest had delicate features and long silky brown hair. She wore a minstrels garb and a large beret, topped with a large decorative feather. She was depicted playing a lute, yet appearing disconsolately bored.\nIn the , a portrait of Ernest Tillerturn painted by Oskar Fevras was kept in the attic of the Jannath estate of Baldurs Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing poltergeist unwittingly summoned by the painter. Other copies of the same lute-playing depiction were seen across the city of Baldurs Gate."
