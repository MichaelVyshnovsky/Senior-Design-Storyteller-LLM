        "Description": "Ernest had delicate features and long silky brown hair. She wore a [[minstrel]]'s garb and a large beret, topped with a large decorative feather. She was depicted playing a [[lute]], yet appearing disconsolately bored.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a portrait of Ernest Tillerturn painted by [[Oskar Fevras]] was kept in the attic of the [[Jannath estate]] of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing [[poltergeist]] unwittingly summoned by the painter. Other copies of the same lute-playing depiction were seen across the city of Baldur's Gate."
