'''Rorreth Monforoth''' was an exiled [[Red Wizard of Thay]] sent to [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History==
Rorreth was one of the many exiled Red Wizards. He joined the faction of [[Rath Modar]], which was allied with the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Under Rath's and the Cult's orders, Rorreth infiltrated [[Valhingen Graveyard]] in Phlan in order to locate the [[Pool of Radiance (disambiguation)|Pool of Radiance]]. He raised many [[undead]], which caused troubles for local [[Kelemvor]]ite priests. Thus the Kelemvorites hired an adventuring party to investigate and in the end the adventurers discovered Rorreth, but could not capture him before he fled{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|5}}

After becoming more powerful, he decided to achieve power for himself by exploring [[Yarash]]'s pyramid but was defeated by adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/Dark Pyramid of Sorcerer's Isle|22}}
