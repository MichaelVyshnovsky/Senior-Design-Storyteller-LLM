Rorreth Monforoth was an exiled Red Wizard of Thay sent to Phlan in 1489 DR.
Rorreth was one of the many exiled Red Wizards. He joined the faction of Rath Modar, which was allied with the reformed Cult of the Dragon. Under Raths and the Cults orders, Rorreth infiltrated Valhingen Graveyard in Phlan in order to locate the Pool of Radiance. He raised many undead, which caused troubles for local Kelemvorite priests. Thus the Kelemvorites hired an adventuring party to investigate and in the end the adventurers discovered Rorreth, but could not capture him before he fled
After becoming more powerful, he decided to achieve power for himself by exploring Yarashs pyramid but was defeated by adventurers.
