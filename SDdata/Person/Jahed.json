        "History": "Jahed began life as part of a group of gypsies in the [[Dalelands]]. His parents were entertainers who stole from the people they met. His father, [[Mercurio]], was a cruel man who enjoyed the suffering of others and often compounded it. His mother was timid and sickly, due to her husband's near-constant abuse, starting long before Jahed was born.\n\nWhen he was a teenager, Jahed started a romance with a local girl named [[Milissa (Dalelands)|Milissa]]. His father noticed his frequent disappearances from camp and followed him to where the couple were meeting. Mercurio attacked his son, knocking him to the ground and proceeded to insult Milissa. When he tried to attack her too, she avoided the blow and transformed into a [[tiger]].",
