'''Hawkstone''' was a [[ranger]] in the [[Dragon Reach]] area in [[1357 DR]].
  
==History==
Hawkstone was a swordsmith of renown but abandoned everything to follow his love, the ranger [[Lhoraie]]. Together they wandered the [[Sword Coast]], the [[North]], and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], working as allies of the [[Harpers]] and the [[Lords' Alliance]].

However, when Lhoraie died in childbirth together with their child, Hawkstone buried them near [[Silverymoon]] and in his grief started to wandered the Dragon Reach, always helping others and fighting evil.

For a period he warred against the [[giant]]s of the [[Great Glacier]] and the [[ogre]]s of [[Thar]]. At some point he faced off against the [[black dragon]] [[Yindoth]] and slayed the beast.

==Rumors==
Hawkstone said that the goddess [[Mielikki]] appeared to him and comforted him after his great loss.

==Possessions==
Among his possessions were a [[magic]]al [[shield]] known as ''[[Hawkstone's Bulwark]]'', and a blade ''[[Durelva]]''. Both of which were pilfered from his grave, years after his passing.
