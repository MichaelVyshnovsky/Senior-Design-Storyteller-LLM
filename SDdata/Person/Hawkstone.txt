Hawkstone was a ranger in the Dragon Reach area in 1357 DR.
Hawkstone was a swordsmith of renown but abandoned everything to follow his love, the ranger Lhoraie. Together they wandered the Sword Coast, the North, and the Sea of Fallen Stars, working as allies of the Harpers and the Lords Alliance.
However, when Lhoraie died in childbirth together with their child, Hawkstone buried them near Silverymoon and in his grief started to wandered the Dragon Reach, always helping others and fighting evil.
For a period he warred against the giants of the Great Glacier and the ogres of Thar. At some point he faced off against the black dragon Yindoth and slayed the beast.
Hawkstone said that the goddess Mielikki appeared to him and comforted him after his great loss.
Among his possessions were a magical shield known as Hawkstones Bulwark, and a blade Durelva. Both of which were pilfered from his grave, years after his passing.
