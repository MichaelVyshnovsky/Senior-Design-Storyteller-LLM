Durth was a deep gnome.
In 1377 DR, Durth was one of the deep gnomes hired by Cavatina Xarann to act as a guide for the combined force of Sshamath wizards and priests of Eilistraee to the main temple of Kiaransalee, which they planned to attack.
However Durth and his companion had long had business with the Crones of Kiaransalee, providing them with voidstone. So they double-crossed the drow. They tried to kill Qarlynd Melarn but instead Qarlynd knocked Durth down and killed his companion.
