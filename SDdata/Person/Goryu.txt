Goryu was a shukenja priest in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Goryu was head priest at the Kanchai Temple of Miyama. He chose to retire here after a life of wandering. Goryu was assisted by a staff of 25 shukenja and 20 servants.
Goryu complained that he had more work now in his retirement than when he wandered the country. However, he couldnt abandon his job. Goryu didnt know this when he accepted the position of head priest.
