As Batna is slain for her crimes with Beherit in other books, both Beherit and Lucifer are stated to be the "original lord of Malbolge", and the ultimate source of both the Dragon Magazine article and ''Elminster'' is the same, the author Ed Greenwood, who has in numerous occassions clarified Lucifer and Batna were destroyed for having a child, it is assumed for this article that Ed Greenwood has written Lucifer to be, or have been, a preferred alias of Beherit.

'''Beherit''' was an [[archdevil]], the original Lord of [[Malbolge]], the sixth layer of the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|23, 30, 32}}

==Description==
Little could be said of Beherit's original appearance. His skull was {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, had many horns, and was known to communicate in a hissing whisper.

==Activities==
Though the archdevil remained dead, Beherit's skull retained a vestige of his evil and was possessed of its own sapience. The skull sought to return itself to life, which it believed could only be done once it returned to the Nine Hells.

==Relationships==
It was said that Beherit had been close allies with, or even the closest friend of, the archdevil [[Gargauth]], and that his death was the reason for Gargauth's departure from Baator.<ref>

==History==
Almost nothing about Beherit was remembered, except that he was loyally served by his marshal, the successful general [[Kochbiel]], and that he and his consort [[Batna]] were destroyed by [[Asmodeus]] for breaking restrictions concerning the advancement of [[devil]]s. 

Eons after this event, Beherit's skull was obtained by the agents of the [[arcanaloth]] Shemeshka the Marauder and placed within the [[Gzemnid#Realm|realm]] of the [[beholder]] [[god]] [[Gzemnid]] as part of a scheme to influence the reports of the [[Great Modron March]].
