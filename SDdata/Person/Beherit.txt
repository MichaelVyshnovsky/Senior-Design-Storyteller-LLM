Beherit was an archdevil, the original Lord of Malbolge, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells.
Little could be said of Beherits original appearance. His skull was  in diameter, had many horns, and was known to communicate in a hissing whisper.
Though the archdevil remained dead, Beherits skull retained a vestige of his evil and was possessed of its own sapience. The skull sought to return itself to life, which it believed could only be done once it returned to the Nine Hells.
It was said that Beherit had been close allies with, or even the closest friend of, the archdevil Gargauth, and that his death was the reason for Gargauths departure from Baator.
Almost nothing about Beherit was remembered, except that he was loyally served by his marshal, the successful general Kochbiel, and that he and his consort Batna were destroyed by Asmodeus for breaking restrictions concerning the advancement of devils. 
Eons after this event, Beherits skull was obtained by the agents of the arcanaloth Shemeshka the Marauder and placed within the realm of the beholder god Gzemnid as part of a scheme to influence the reports of the Great Modron March.
