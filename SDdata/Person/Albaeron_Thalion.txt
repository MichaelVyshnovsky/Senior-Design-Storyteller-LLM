'''Albaeron Thalion''' was a high-ranking monk of [[Candlekeep]].

==History==
Thalion hailed from [[Athkatla]], where he was a great calligrapher and artist until [[Oghma]] appeared in his dreams to call him.

In time, he became one of the Great Readers of Candlekeep.

In [[1487 DR]], Thalion, after being saved from [[shadovar]] and [[Moonstars]], agreed to participate in [[Larloch]]'s plan to rebuild the [[Weave]].
