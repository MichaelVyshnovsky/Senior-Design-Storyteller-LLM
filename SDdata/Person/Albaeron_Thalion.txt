Albaeron Thalion was a high-ranking monk of Candlekeep.
Thalion hailed from Athkatla, where he was a great calligrapher and artist until Oghma appeared in his dreams to call him.
In time, he became one of the Great Readers of Candlekeep.
In 1487 DR, Thalion, after being saved from shadovar and Moonstars, agreed to participate in Larlochs plan to rebuild the Weave.
