        "mainbody": "Rexin was the viper familiar of Handragath, a wizard member of the Cult of the Dragon circa 1369 DR.\nRexin was a tiny magical beast.\nRexin could swim and, like other vipers, possessed a venomous bite. Rexins venom, once in the targets bloodstream, dealt damage to the victims constitution. Like other familiars, Rexin shared a link with his master. Handragath could channel magic and cast spells through his familiar. Rexin could speak to his master and other snakes.\nIn 1369 DR, Rexin resided in Darnarests tower alongside Handragath and a small Cult of the Dragon slaver operation. Under Handragaths leadership, the Cult was capturing local villagers and able-bodied adventurers to send them through a portal in the towers basement to Myth Drannor, where they were doomed to work for the cult or be murdered and turned into undead servants."
