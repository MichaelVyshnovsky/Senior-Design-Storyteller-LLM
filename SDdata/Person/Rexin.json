        "mainbody": "'''Rexin''' was the [[viper]] [[familiar]] of [[Handragath]], a [[wizard]] member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Rexin was a tiny [[magical beast]].",
        "Abilities": "Rexin could swim and, like other vipers, possessed a venomous bite. Rexin's venom, once in the target's bloodstream, dealt damage to the victim's constitution. Like other familiars, Rexin shared a link with his master. Handragath could channel magic and cast spells through his familiar. Rexin could speak to his master and other [[snake]]s.",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, Rexin resided in [[Darnarest's tower]] alongside Handragath and a small [[Cult of the Dragon]] slaver operation. Under Handragath's leadership, the Cult was capturing local villagers and able-bodied adventurers to send them through a portal in the tower's basement to [[Myth Drannor]], where they were doomed to work for the cult or be murdered and turned into undead servants."
