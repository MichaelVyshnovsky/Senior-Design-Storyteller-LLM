'''Chiquong''' was a [[shukenja]] and holy man in the land of [[Koryo]].

Seeking a suitable locale for his hermitage, Chiquong had journeyed to the southern tip of the island of [[Saishu]], but had still found nothing to his liking. So instead he raised an island from the depths of the sea, a desolate rock that came to be called [[Su'un]]. There he dwelled, with the wind his only companion.

Rumors told that Chiquong still lived on Su'un by [[1350 DR]], and that he could predict the future and hid great riches.
