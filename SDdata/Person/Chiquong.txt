Chiquong was a shukenja and holy man in the land of Koryo.
Seeking a suitable locale for his hermitage, Chiquong had journeyed to the southern tip of the island of Saishu, but had still found nothing to his liking. So instead he raised an island from the depths of the sea, a desolate rock that came to be called Suun. There he dwelled, with the wind his only companion.
Rumors told that Chiquong still lived on Suun by 1350 DR, and that he could predict the future and hid great riches.
