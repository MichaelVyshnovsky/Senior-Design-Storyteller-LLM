'''Jherremor''' was a [[ghirrash]] lairing in the [[Shadow Citadel]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Jherremor served the [[church of Shar|cultists]] of [[Shar]] based at the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]]. He was the principle guardian of the Shadow Planeâ€“side of the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] ''[[portal]]'', which linked the Lost Refuge to the Shadow Citadel, and patrolled the land around. Although the [[Shadowscale]]s sufficed for most lesser threats there, they could call on Jherremor to destroy any major foe. He answered to [[Bestra Mornscroll]], albeit sullenly. To keep him satisfied, the Sharrans allowed him to have his fun with captives they did not require for their plans.

He was ferocious and bloodthirsty, relishing the chance to kill and butcher captives, as well as beasts it caught in the [[Shadow Swamp]], such as [[dark]] [[giant frog]]s. His lair was his kitchen, a gore-soaked chamber where the dismembered corpses of men and beasts hung from hooks and [[chain]]s. He would mount still-struggling victims on these hooks if he could grab them.

He was also avaricious, and stole from his victims.

==Possessions==
Jherremor's hoard included a fortune in [[silver]] and [[gold]] pieces, as well as [[amethyst]]s and [[spinel]]s of deep blue hue. He also possessed [[potion]]s of ''[[barkskin]]'' and ''[[levitate]]'', a [[scroll]] of ''[[confusion]]'', and a ''[[brooch of shielding]]''.

==History==
Eventually, in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Jherremor was encountered and presumably defeated by a party of adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] intent on ruining the Sharrans' plot.
