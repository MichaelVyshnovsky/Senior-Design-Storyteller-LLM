Meykhati and a group of other wealthy senators would pay for Willem's seat and in return Willem was obliged to give Meykhati his votes on the senate for five years.\n\nPrior to Senator [[Salatis]]'s seizure of power in [[1365 DR]], Meykhati was rumoured as the most likely candidate to be the next Ransar. <ref>.\n\nMeykhati joined Salatis in denouncing [[Ivar Devorast]]'s leadership of the canal project in senate. <ref>"
