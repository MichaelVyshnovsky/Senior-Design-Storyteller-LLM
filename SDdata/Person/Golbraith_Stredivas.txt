==Description==
Golbraith was a man with curly hair and trimmed beard silvered with age. His skin had deep wrinkles and the scars of a life of danger. His blue eyes were framed by a [[monocle]], and his aged body was draped in mage's [[robe]]s. He had a habit of talking to himself, which developed in his late life's solitude.

==Abilities==
Golbraith Stredivas was an experienced war-caster wizard who was proficient in [[spell]]-sculpting.

==Relationships==
Golbraith was renowned as an expert on the topic of mind flayers and a master of counter-illithid measures. His fame was respected even at the citadel library of [[Candlekeep]]. At the time of the [[Absolute crisis]], the First Reader of Candlekeep sent a letter to Golbraith requesting his expertise. The adventurer also had dealings with the [[Society of Brilliance]] and [[The Lodge]] in the Lower City. His work on anti-illithid countermeasures received some acclaim among adventurers, and some sent the author letters of gratitude and recounts of how the work saved their lives.

==History==
In his youth, Golbraith made a living as an adventurer and a monster hunter. The wizard frequented the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the Lower City when he was within Baldur's Gate's walls. During one of his ventures to "feel the pulse of the city," the [[Grand Duke]] of the time, the famed [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]], met Golbraith at one of the terrace tables of the Elfsong. The two accidentally bought each other's drinks by calling the same waiter to them. The strangers stroke up a conversation, and when the Duke found out that Golbraith was a fellow adventurer and a monster hunter, he showered Stredivas with questions. At the next meeting, the Duke revealed that he, too, was an adventurer once, and afterward, they met regularly at the same tavern, turning conversations into a friendship. Many [[tenday]]s later, Golbraith realized that his new friend was the Grand Duke. Sometime before the Grand Duke's death, he gifted ''[[Abdel's trusted shield]]'' to his friend.

When [[the Absolute]] menaced Baldur's Gate in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Golbraith was already an aged and retired man, forced to abandon the life of daring adventure after suffering a devious illiquid trap. Despite that, he was confident in the city's safety, knowing that his son fought for the Gate and for its people.

==Relationships==
Sometime in his younger days, Golbraith fathered a son, who by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, was twice as great a fighter as Golbraith was and was also a capable illithid slayer, who lived away from Golbraith's large home in the Lower City. 

==Works==
He also penned a book about his friendship with Abdel Adrian, ''Confidant of a Duke'', as well as a guide to protecting oneself from mind flayers, ''On Psionic Manipulations and Countermeasures,'' sometime before 1492 DR.
