Doomguide Stonehammer was a priest of Kelemvor who lived in Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
Circa the , Stonehammer and several other doomguides were sent to investigate strange goings-on in the Paupers Field area of Neverdeath Graveyard. A number of Red Wizards were luring the Kelemvorite priests into the cemetery as bait for use in their dark rituals to raise the undead.
Stonehammer was one of the priests to fall to the Thayans devious plan, being raised as an undead creature himself. His undead form was put down by an adventurer a short time later, however, at the behest of his fellow doomguide, Volahk.
