'''Doomguide Stonehammer''' was a [[priest]] of [[Kelemvor]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Stonehammer and several other [[doomguide]]s were sent to investigate strange goings-on in the [[Pauper's Field]] area of [[Neverdeath Graveyard]]. A number of [[Red Wizards]] were luring the [[Kelemvor]]ite priests into the cemetery as bait for use in their dark rituals to raise the [[undead]].

Stonehammer was one of the priests to fall to the Thayans' devious plan, being raised as an undead creature himself. His undead form was put down by an [[adventurer]] a short time later, however, at the behest of his fellow doomguide, [[Volahk]].
