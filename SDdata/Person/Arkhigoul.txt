'''Arkhigoul''' was a [[lich]] and former foe of [[Zhentil Keep]] who was destroyed some time before {{yearlink|1357}}.

==History==
In a meeting within Zhentil Keep in [[Mirtul 21]] of {{yearlink|1357}}, the destruction of Arkhigoul was cited by Lord [[Kalthas]] as the reason why defending [[Thar]] was no longer an issue, almost certainly implying his defeat had been recent and that he had been an obstacle to an effective defense of Thar.
