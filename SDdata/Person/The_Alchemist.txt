'''The Alchemist''' was a [[green slaad]] posing as a [[human]] man in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Alchemist settled in a cavern in the [[Twisted Caverns]]. It sold [[potion]]s to travelers, but in truth it was searching for its control gem. If questioned about itself, it said it had been kidnapped by the Mad Mage from a place he couldn't remember.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} [[Halaster]] summoned a green slaad, deprived it of its control gem, and set it loose inside Undermoutain. The slaad wandered many dungeon levels in search of its gem until it sensed the gem somewhere inside the Twisted Caverns. So it disguised itself as a human alchemist and started selling potions to travelers.

==Personality==
The Alchemist only wanted to get back its gem and go back to home. However, in fear of being controlled, it asked nobody for help to find it. As a human alchemist, he could not explain the reason Halaster had kidnapped him.

==Relationship==
[[Jibber-Jabber]] was friend of the Alchemist, who provided the [[ettin]] with a potion that transformed the water in [[Barrelstalk|barrelstalk mushrooms]] into mead.
