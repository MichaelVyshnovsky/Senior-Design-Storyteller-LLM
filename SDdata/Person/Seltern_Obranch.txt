'''Seltern Obranch''' was a [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] that was within the city of [[Elturel]] when it made its [[the Descent|descent]] into the [[Nine Hells]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When Elturel was taken down to [[Avernus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Seltern and other people in the city found refuge in the cathedral of [[High Hall (Elturel)|High Hall]]. During the ordeal, Seltern created batches of ''[[goodberry|goodberries]]'' to help keep himself and his fellow survivors alive. 

Seltern unfortunately felt his connection to Silvanus waning, and did not believe he could continue casting [[divine magic]]. While he believed this a cause of being taken away from [[Toril]], in truth his faith was badly shaken and he was no longer confident in his abilities.
