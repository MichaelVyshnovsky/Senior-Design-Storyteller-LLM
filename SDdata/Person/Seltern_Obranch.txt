Seltern Obranch was a druid of Silvanus that was within the city of Elturel when it made its descent into the Nine Hells in the late 15 century DR.
When Elturel was taken down to Avernus in the , Seltern and other people in the city found refuge in the cathedral of High Hall. During the ordeal, Seltern created batches of goodberries to help keep himself and his fellow survivors alive. 
Seltern unfortunately felt his connection to Silvanus waning, and did not believe he could continue casting divine magic. While he believed this a cause of being taken away from Toril, in truth his faith was badly shaken and he was no longer confident in his abilities.
