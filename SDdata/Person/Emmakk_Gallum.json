        "mainbody": "'''Emmakk Gallum''' was the younger brother of [[Jordy Gallum]], Counut of [[Greenshores]] and the Constable of [[Mosstone]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Sometime before 1370 DR, Emmakk Gallum succeeded his older brother, Jordy Gallum, as the Constable of [[Mosstone]], a lush green town on the edge of the [[Forest of Tethir]] along the [[Trade Way]]. In his new position, he was one of the biggest authorities in Mosstone, apart from the local [[druid]]s, however little actual authority there was in the town. Emmakk led a small guard and defenders troop of twenty-five and occasionally acted as Mosstone's representative."
