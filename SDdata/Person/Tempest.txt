Bawdy and quick as a [[courtesan (prostitute)|street courtesan]], Tempest was wonderfully talented in all her exploits.

==Possessions==
When hunting and stealing, Tempest preferred to wear black [[leather armor]].

==History==
In [[1339 DR]], Ren and Tempest stole a pair of magical [[dagger]]s and [[ioun stone]]s from an assassin's guild in [[Waterdeep]].

Later that year, the killers found Ren and Tempest in their Waterdhavian home and stabbed Tempest through her left breast.
