        "mainbody": "Don Juan Montery was an infamous adventuring knight of the Golden Rooster order from the city of Ravens Bluff, active in the late 14 century DR.\nDon Juan was a fair-haired man of, allegedly, noble Cimbarian blood.\nDon Juan Montery swiftly advanced in rank among the Knights of the Golden Rooster within a single year. His adventures brought the knight to the attention of Jacinth \"Jackie\" Moonspring, the Society Editor of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet. However, it was Don Juans sexual conquests that earned him an appearance in Jacinths column. The Society Editor speculated that Don Juan Montery mustve lost a bet because he was seen frolicking with Vedina Stareye, a woman with pox-scarred face and a voice that sounded like fingernails scratching slate. Within one month, Montery was seen in the company of other ladies of the Bluff the half-elven scout named Opal Starlight and a handsome paladin of Tyr, Yvonne Chantel. Interestingly enough, Yvonne claimed to have had never been with the \"Chicken Knight\" herself. The latest conquest, or maybe, a target of Monterys attention, was a fellow Knight of the Golden Roosterâ€”Ladyhawke. Jackie Moonspring also noted that it was unknown if Don Juan and Ladyhawke would ever get close as the man was an infantry member, while Ladyhawke served as a city walls guardswoman."
