        "mainbody": "'''Winn Kardzen''' was a [[half-elf]] [[necromancer]] and a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], leading the [[Glarondan cell]] in [[Aglarond]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Covertly, Winn led the Dragon Cult cell based in the small village of [[Glarondar]]. He was persuading the [[fang dragon]] [[Nartheling]], who made his lair on [[Umbergoth Peak]], to accept transformation into a [[dracolich]]. Venerating Nartheling, Winn and his cultists periodically made expeditions up Umbergoth Peak to deliver information on affairs in the village and on local caravans and patrols the fang dragon could attack and take treasure from.\n\nKardzen was also laying plans for a joint attack on the Glarondar fortress. To this end, he was raising [[undead]] from the [[Umber Marshes]] to fake an attack from [[Thay]] to draw away patrols from the [[Watchwall]], thus allowing Nartheling to tear apart Glarondar untroubled by its defenders.",
        "History": "In the early 1370s DR, Winn was on the verge of sealing the deal with Nartheling, but he needed a [[phylactery]] worthy of the [[dragon]]'s essence and so sought out a relic of the right fame and nature. He more than succeeded, locating one of the horns of the fallen [[red dragon]] [[Shargrailar]], the first and most powerful dracolich. It had been turned into a drinking vessel, the ''[[Grail of Shargrailar]]'', by lining it with [[platinum]] and encrusting it with [[jewel]]s, which did not harm its value.\n\n[[File:Grail of Shargrailar.jpg|thumb|right|''The ''Grail of Shargrailar'' sought after by Winn Kardzen.'']]\nAfter his agents obtained the ''Grail'' and shipped it to [[Velprintalar]], ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], Winn hired the merchant [[Tulin Farweather]] to transport it to his village, so as not to attract unwanted attention. However, it was lost ''en route''â€”when the caravan carrying the horn made camp near a stone circle in the [[Yuirwood]], the [[undead]] [[star elf]] [[Mourel Duskwalker]] emerged from a nearby ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Night Realm]], stole the ''Grail'' for his own purposes, and retreated with it back to his [[demiplane]], all in secret. Not knowing what had happened, Tulin would try to hire [[adventurer]]s to find the lost horn. Kardzen and the Cult would also try to search for and recover the lost horn, but the ''Grail''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> fate is unknown."
