'''Viryn''' was a [[solar]] in service to [[Tyr]] in [[1385 DR]].

==History==
Viryn was a solar in service to Tyr in [[Mount Celestia]]. He was in charge of the escort that brought the [[diviner]] [[deva]] [[Eirwyn]] to prison. After the [[Spellplague]], Viryn was ordered to free Eirwyn and take her to a council. Later, Viryn fought against the [[fiend]] armies that tried to invade Celestia, profiting off the chaos.
