        "History": "{{quote\n|Teralyn —<br/>The mercenaries we hired bungled the job, so you must free Black. We shall launch a raid through the Shadowfell as a distraction while you get the priest out.\n|Teralyn's last orders\n}}\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the forces of [[Returned Netheril]] attempted to take over the Cormyrean prison-town of [[Wheloon]], using the population of [[Sharran]] cultists and innocents trapped within the urban prison. When the infamous Sharran priest [[Dedryk Black]] was recaptured and returned after escaping, he was interrogated in the [[Wheloon Docks]] [[Magistrate's Office]] by Magistrate [[Cornelius Latrimor]] and a band of heroes from the world of [[Eberron]]. After some questioning, Dedryk revealed that he and the other escapees had magically travelled through the shadows to freedom, but before he could tell more, Teralyn and her forces suddenly attacked the Wheloon Docks as a whole, threatening to overrun Cormyr's gateway to the prison.\n\nTeralyn and her forces appeared seemingly from nowhere by using brief magical surges that temporarily overlapped the [[Shadowfell]] with material reality, allowing a small horde of living [[shadow]]s to distract the defending [[Purple Dragons]] and [[War Wizards]], and creating tangible shadowy barriers that split the defenders and kept them from rallying their forces properly. The attack was also joined by many furious and desperate prisoners, who were more than willing to fight for a chance at freedom and revenge. They even threatened to take a large cargo ship on the docks that had been used to move prisoners and soldiers into the city, but the attempted mass breakout was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nWhile Cormyr's forces were fighting for their lives, Teralyn simply stepped through the shadows into the chambers where Dedryk Black was being kept, slew Magistrate Cornelius Latrimor, and sent Dedryk back through the Shadowfell to freedom. Before she could abscond herself, she was cornered by the heroes from Eberron and slain in turn, with only her last orders recovered as explanation."
