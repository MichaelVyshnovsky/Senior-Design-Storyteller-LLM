        "mainbody": "eralyn was a Netherese shadar-kai assassin who attacked the Cormyrean forces at the Wheloon prison in the late 15 century DR.\nLike other shadar-kai, Teralyn had ashy gray skin, black hair, facial tattoos and scarring. She was armed with two daggers and a spiked chain for weapons.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the forces of Returned Netheril attempted to take over the Cormyrean prison-town of Wheloon, using the population of Sharran cultists and innocents trapped within the urban prison. When the infamous Sharran priest Dedryk Black was recaptured and returned after escaping, he was interrogated in the Wheloon Docks Magistrates Office by Magistrate Cornelius Latrimor and a band of heroes from the world of Eberron. After some questioning, Dedryk revealed that he and the other escapees had magically travelled through the shadows to freedom, but before he could tell more, Teralyn and her forces suddenly attacked the Wheloon Docks as a whole, threatening to overrun Cormyrs gateway to the prison.\nTeralyn and her forces appeared seemingly from nowhere by using brief magical surges that temporarily overlapped the Shadowfell with material reality, allowing a small horde of living shadows to distract the defending Purple Dragons and War Wizards, and creating tangible shadowy barriers that split the defenders and kept them from rallying their forces properly. The attack was also joined by many furious and desperate prisoners, who were more than willing to fight for a chance at freedom and revenge. They even threatened to take a large cargo ship on the docks that had been used to move prisoners and soldiers into the city, but the attempted mass breakout was ultimately unsuccessful.\nWhile Cormyrs forces were fighting for their lives, Teralyn simply stepped through the shadows into the chambers where Dedryk Black was being kept, slew Magistrate Cornelius Latrimor, and sent Dedryk back through the Shadowfell to freedom. Before she could abscond herself, she was cornered by the heroes from Eberron and slain in turn, with only her last orders recovered as explanation."
