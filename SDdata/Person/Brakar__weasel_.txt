Brakar was a weasel and the familiar of Chaid al Farid al Fuqani, an apprentice of Blackstaff Tower.
Brakar had fur that matched the color of his masters eyes almost perfectly.
Chaid first bonded with Brakar on Uktar 28 in the , after a night and morning of performing the required magical ritual. Chaid wanted to name the creature "Brakar", after the brakar, a two-gold piece in circulation in Darromar, the capital of Tethyr. On the advice of Tsarra Chaadren, Chaid first asked the weasel if he already had a name, and, on learning that he did not, asked if he minded being called "Brakar", to which the little magic animal agreed. Brakar was very happy to be given a name and took it as a gift.
Later in the day, Brakar skittered across Chaids shoulders and heads in excitement at seeing inside the gates of Waterdeep for the first time.
Tsarra had to instruct her own familiar, the tressym Nameless that the weasel was not food.
