Though Almorel was spared from an assault from the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Tuigan Horde]] during the great wars, Mavnar believe it prudent to replace Almorel's wooden walls with solid stone to dissuade future aggression from the belligerent nomads. Mavnar also planned to construct a stone keep within the city by enlisting the expertise of [[dwarves]]."
