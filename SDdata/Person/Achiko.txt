'''Achiko''' was the son of a noble of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] in the 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
In the summer of {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, the 25-year-old Achiko spent an evening at a drinking house in [[Aru]], where he was preyed upon by three former [[bushi]] turned to crime. Their favorite tactic was feigning revelry, befriending wealthy men in drinking houses and getting them very drunk, while only pretending to be drunk themselves, before luring him into a dark alley, robbing him, and usually cutting his throat. Such was the fate awaiting Achiko, unless a group of passing adventurers noticed them, grew suspicious, and intervened, but Achiko was oblivious and useless in a fight. If they rescued him, his father might reward them.
