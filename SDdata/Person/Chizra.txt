Chizra was a priestess of Eilistraee and one of the Protectors of the Song in the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.
In 1377 DR, she was one of the six Protectors chosen by Cavatina Xarann to lead an assault on the main temple of Kiaransalee. Cavatina ordered Chizra to return to the Promenade with the body of the dead Halav.
Later, she went back to the expedition with Leliana Vrinn, but found only Qarlynd Melarn.
In 1379 DR, Chizra was among the Protectors alerted by Cavatina to stop a dretch infiltrator in the Promenade.
