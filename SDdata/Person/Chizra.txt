'''Chizra''' was a priestess of [[Eilistraee]] and one of the [[Protectors of the Song]] in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].
 
==History==
In [[1377 DR]], she was one of the six Protectors chosen by [[Cavatina Xarann]] to lead an assault on the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]]. Cavatina ordered Chizra to return to the Promenade with the body of the dead [[Halav]].

Later, she went back to the expedition with [[Leliana Vrinn]], but found only [[Q'arlynd Melarn]].

In [[1379 DR]], Chizra was among the Protectors alerted by Cavatina to stop a [[dretch]] infiltrator in the Promenade.
