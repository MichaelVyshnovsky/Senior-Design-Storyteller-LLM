Ruduk was a Red Wizard of Thay agent in Messemprar in Unther in 1357 DR.
Ruduk was sent by the zulkir Lauzoril to destabilize the country in order that one day Thay could conquer it. He had great autonomy in his plans.
Ruduk did not truly care for the future of Unther, only to advance his position inside the Red Wizards.
