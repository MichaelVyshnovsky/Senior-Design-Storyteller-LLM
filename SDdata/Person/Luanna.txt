Luanna was a skilled blacksmith inhabiting the city of Zhentil Keep during the lateâ€“14 century DR.
She was heavily muscled and had blonde hair worn in two long braids. Many dwarves thought she would be the perfect woman if she was just a few feet shorter.
She owned Luannas Forge which was located in the Foreign Quarter in between Center Street and Teshwave Street.
Luanna had a reputation for crafting the best weapons and armor in the city.
She did not get along well with her neighbor Balrud Thal. The pair tried to make the others life as miserable as possible.
