        "mainbody": "'''Anomen Delryn''' was a nobleman and a squire who served in the [[Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''\"Long live the Order of the Most Radiant Heart – for I draw from the pool of right and strike in their name.\"''|Anomen}}",
        "Personality": "Anomen's often gave the first impression of being an insufferably vain who constantly bragged about battles he'd most likely never fought.",
        "Relationships": "Anomen had a strained relationship with his father. He often submitted to Lord Delryn's hostility and vitriol regardless of how he felt.\n\nHe had great respect for [[Keldorn Firecam]], a highly respected senior member of the Order of the Radiant Heart. Sir [[Ryan Trawl]] held Anomen to high esteem and believed him ready to achieve full knighthood. He was well-acquainted  with other squires from the order, among them [[Ajantis Ilvastarr]] of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Possessions": "Anomen owned a ''[[Delryn family shield|unique shield]]'' that was gifted to him by his father.",
        "History": "Anomen Delryn, a native of Athkatla, was the son of Lord [[Cor Delryn|Cor]] and Lady [[Moirala Delryn]]. He had a younger sister, [[Moira Delryn|Moira]]. His mother died while Anomen was relatively young.\n\nIn the 1360s [[DR]], Anomen's ambition to become a [[paladin]] of [[Helm]] was denied when his father, wanting his son to join him in the family merchant business, refused to sponsor him for knighthood. He became estranged from his father. Instead, Anomen chose to train as a warrior-priest of Helm, and sought his knighthood through the sponsorship of the [[Church of Helm]].\n\nDuring his time as a squire he fought many battles alongside the knights of the Radiant Heart. He was there for their campaign against the [[Hillgnasher]] [[giant]]s. He helped battle against the [[orc]]s that poured down from the [[Ommlur Hills]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Anomen traveled with some squires of [[Torm]] to a tournament in the city of [[Riatavin]]. On their way, the group was waylaid by a [[griffon]]. While knights-to-be were scattered and panicked, Anomen managed to get into the griffon's back and slay it with his [[spear]]. \n\nAs of the the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he was still a squire in the Most Noble of Order of the Radiant Heart and would soon be facing his knighthood trial. He spent some time in the [[Copper Coronet]] in the slums of [[Athkatla]] seeking a group with which to adventure."
