        "mainbody": "'''Patma''' was a [[storm giant]] from the [[storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain]].<ref group=\"note\">This fact is deduced because one of Patma's companions was [[Ramos]], and Ramos was the former [[paramount]] of the storm giant aerie described in ''Giantcraft''.",
        "Description": "Patma had pale violet skin and blue-black hair that was very long and unkempt. He was clean-shaven. Patma typically wore a simple tunic with a large amount of silver jewelry. His eyes were silver-colored.",
        "Possessions": "Patma bore a rusted sword in battle.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the then-[[paramount]] of the storm giants of Mount Woe, Anastes, and five other storm giants were summoned magically by [[Lanaxis]] to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] and her son [[Kaedlaw Burdun|Kaedlaw]]. Patma was one of those giants. Patma and [[Sebastion]] were chosen to find wine and vegetables for Brianna to eat, but during this time, [[Tavis Burdun]] and armies of [[giant-kin]] attacked. Patma and Sebastion were then ordered by Anastes to deal with the [[firbolg]]s. Patma fought with Tavis, until his sword was magically shattered by the firbolg [[shaman]] [[Munairoe]]. He was then taken down and killed by three firbolg warriors."
