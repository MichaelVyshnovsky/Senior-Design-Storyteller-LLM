        "mainbody": "Rakor was a black dragon who dwelled in the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier in the late 14 century DR.\nRakor had dealings with the Cult of the Dragon.\nthumb|right|350px|Rakor dives right in.\nCirca 1400 DR,The battle is undated but is \"a century ago\" from the date of Honor Among Thieves, which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The , is a likely candidate. Rakor and a Cult of the Dragon army battled a force of the Uthgardt Elk tribe for control of the helmet of disjunction, a relic with the power to break all magic. In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors, the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, but Rakor more than made up for that by flying overhead and vomiting acid on the barbarians ranks. Stanhard ordered a retreat and entrusted the helmet to his fastest rider, Ven Salafin, to get it away from Rakor however he could, before the chief was dissolved as well. Ven passed it to Xenk Yendar as he too died,Its unknown how and why the Elk tribe had the helmet of disjunction, nor why Rakor and the Cult of the Dragon wanted it beyond its magical and monetary value. The product description for the Rakor Nerf blaster toy describes as Rakor as unleashing acid breath on adventures who dared challenge him or touch his treasure, which, though standard procedure for dragons, is perhaps meant to imply the Elk tribe stole the Helmet from his hoard. This at least fits the Elk tribes usual habits."
