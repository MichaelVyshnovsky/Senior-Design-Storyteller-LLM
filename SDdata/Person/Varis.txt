Varis was a half-elf ranger and adventurer from Silverymoon.
Varis was part of an adventuring troupe with the bard Ellywick Tumblestrum, the wizard Hama Pashar, and the paladin Nadaar.
Although well in tune with his wolf companion, Varis was a deeply thoughtful man and so could appear aloof to others. He was exceptionally perceptive and aware of his surroundings, though, so his fellow adventurers knew he always had their backs.
