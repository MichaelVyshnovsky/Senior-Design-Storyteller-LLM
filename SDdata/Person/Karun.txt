'''Karun the Black''' was a [[Bhaalspawn]] [[mage]] who fought alongside [[Gromnir Il-Khan]] during the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]] in [[Tethyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilties==
Karun was a particularly powerful [[spellcaster]], capable of casting spells that could ''[[wail of the banshee|emit the horrifying sound]]'' of a [[banshee]], or even ''[[time stop|stop time for a short duration]]''.

==History==
When Saradush was under siege by [[Yaga-Shura]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Karun remained with Gromnir Il-Khan and other Bhaalspawn while they barricaded himself within the city's castle. He fought alongside and against his divine siblings, when [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions stormed the city's castle.
