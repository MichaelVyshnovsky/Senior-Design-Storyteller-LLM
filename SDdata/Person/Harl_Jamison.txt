'''Harl Jamison''' was a legendary hero of the [[gnome]]kind who lived in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Harl Jamison was the leader of the all-gnome adventuring troupe called the [[Sons of Green Hills]], who defended their homelands from [[ogre]]s and [[goblin]]s. Even though Harl died of old age in the {{YearlinkName|845}}, the Sons of Green Hills and Harl were immortalized in gnomish folk ballads and tales, still remembered as of the late 13{{th}} century DR. Harl's final resting place, however, was robbed by [[human]] grave robbers ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|890}}, who were thought to steal the gnome's [[enchanted]] [[sling]] that would later be known as ''[[Jamison's sling]].''
