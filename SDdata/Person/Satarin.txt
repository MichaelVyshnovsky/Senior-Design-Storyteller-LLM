Brother Satarin was a dwarf priest in Helms Hold near Neverwinter in 1479 DR.
Satarin took care of the crazed inmates of the Cathedral.
In 1479 DR, he noted that the madness that had spread in Neverwinter on the Night of the Madness had transferred to Helms Hold. So he sent a letter to an adventuring party that had come to be involved in the matter. Soon after, however, Helms Hold fell under the control of the Tormentor and his mind-thrall minions.
His long exposure to crazed people had slightly confused Satarin.
