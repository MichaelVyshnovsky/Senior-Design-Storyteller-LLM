'''Skar''' was a [[goblin]] bandit of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He served [[Hekkut]] and [[the Hark]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/"Extermination" Plot Recap}}

==Personality==
Skar was psychotic and spiteful, as well as stubborn, but brave.

==Possessions==
Like many goblins, he fought with [[morning star]]s, had a [[light crossbow]], and wore [[studded leather armor]], and may have had a ''[[potion]] of [[cure light wounds]]''.

==History==
Late one afternoon in [[Eleasias]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Skar, [[Gvrag]], and two other [[goblin]]s caught the [[halfling]] merchant [[Blaz Merrymar]] on the road between [[Loudwater]] and [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]]. While Gvrag held Blaz in the air, Skar tormented and tortured him with a lit [[torch]]. Blaz heard him remark "This half-man has looser skin than the others. We must be getting to the bottom of the barrel." Fortunately for Blaz, a newly formed band of [[adventurer]]s happened upon the scene and rescued him, slaying Skar and the others.
