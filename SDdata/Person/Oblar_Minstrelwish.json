        "mainbody": "'''Oblar Minstrelwish''' was a [[halfling]] adventurer of some notoriety from [[Secomber]]. On his travels, he met [[Mrune Moontan]], a [[half-elf]] [[sorceress]] with many talents, including brewing the best [[ale]] that Oblar had ever tasted. They eventually married and started the [[Moon Mountain Brewery]] on the [[Unicorn Run]] north of Secomber. As of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], his descendants were still operating the brewery, along with another family of halflings, the [[Borulglar]], to whom they were related by blood and marriage.{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80}}"
