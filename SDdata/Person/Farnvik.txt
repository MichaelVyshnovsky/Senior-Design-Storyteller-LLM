'''Farnvik the Venemous''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==History==
Farnvik was a cultist cleric of [[Tiamat]]. In [[1489 DR]], he was one of the main leaders{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|18}} of the contingent of cultists who'd arrived secretly in [[Phlan]] aboard ships. Just after the [[green dragon]] [[Vorgansharax]] killed or captured the city's leaders at [[Valjevo Castle]], Farnvik led a cultist patrol, including a [[guard drake]] and a [[half-dragon]] [[ettin]], to collect "tributes" from Phlan's citizens. He was eventually defeated by an adventuring party.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|9-10}}
