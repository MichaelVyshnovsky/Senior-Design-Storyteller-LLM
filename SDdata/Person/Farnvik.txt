Farnvik the Venemous was a member of the Cult of the Dragon during the Tyranny of Dragons.
Farnvik was a cultist cleric of Tiamat. In 1489 DR, he was one of the main leaders of the contingent of cultists whod arrived secretly in Phlan aboard ships. Just after the green dragon Vorgansharax killed or captured the citys leaders at Valjevo Castle, Farnvik led a cultist patrol, including a guard drake and a half-dragon ettin, to collect "tributes" from Phlans citizens. He was eventually defeated by an adventuring party.
