Raeveshara Gudelmer was a member of the Gudelmer merchant family and the oldest daughter of Albaerlus Gudelmer who resided in Athkatla in the late 14 century DR.
Like her sister, Raeveshara Gudelmer was a smart, astute, and charming woman.
By the late 14 century DR, Nilunele Raeveshara had three siblings, all sisters. Iylandra was her younger sister, and she had younger twin siblings â€“ Quaerthara and Nilunele. The sisters lived with their father, Albaerlus, in the family mansion, famously haunted and beautiful Dancing Dolphins House in Athkatlas resplendent Gem District. All four sisters were professional escorts and guides to Athkatlam, offering their services to visitors in need of companionship. The Gudelmer sisters were well-known in Athkatlas upper classes through their social status and professional life. Raevesharas best skill that brought her successes and coin was acting.
