        "mainbody": "elm Stoneblade was a knight serving the Stag King of Athalantar, Uthgrael Aumar, and the new king of the kingdom after 240 DR.\nHelm was a knight serving the kingdom of Athalantar and his king Uthgrael. When the king died in 216 DR and his sons, the Warring Princes of Athalantar, started a bloody contest for the throne, Helm and many of his fellows abandoned the court and started lives as outlaws, especially after power was seized by Belaur Aumar and the magelords.\nHelm tried to fight the usurpers but with little hope. In 222 DR, he made friends with young Elminster Aumar. Later, the magelords killed Elminsters parents, and he helped him in all things.\nMany years later, Elminster, by now a powerful wizard, came back in his country to defeat the magelords and recruit Helm and his fellows as allies. Elminster, the only remaining heir of Uthgrael, then nominated Helm to be king for his valor and integrity.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryKnights\nCategoryKings\nCategoryWarriors\nCategoryInhabitants of Athalantar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n3a6hwdt5nmwlbb8a7uhl0gmm0h27f4d"
