Lord Vanrak Moonstar was once a minor noble of House Moonstar of Waterdeep and a noted explorer. Corrupted by Shar, he later became a death knight who led a large cult of Shar known as the Dark Army of the Night in Vanrakdoom, part of the vast Undermountain complex beneath Waterdeep.
After his transformation into a death knight, Vanrak largely occupied himself with expanding the influence of Shar and skirmishing with the followers of Selûne in Waterdeep.
Vanraks greatest success came in the , when his forces infiltrated and burned down the High House of Stars and slew the Moonmaidens protectors.
He befriended a former bronze dragon, Glyster (transformed by the priests into a shadow dragon, who took the name Umbraxakar), who served as his companion, guide, and mount.
