Lord '''Vanrak Moonstar''' was once a minor noble of [[Moonstar (family)|House Moonstar]] of [[Waterdeep]] and a noted explorer. Corrupted by [[Shar]], he later became a [[death knight]] who led a large [[Church of Shar|cult of Shar]] known as the [[Dark Army of the Night]] in [[Vanrakdoom]], part of the vast [[Undermountain]] complex beneath Waterdeep.

==Activities==
After his transformation into a death knight, Vanrak largely occupied himself with expanding the influence of Shar and skirmishing with the followers of Selûne in Waterdeep.

==History==
Vanrak's greatest success came in the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, when his forces infiltrated and burned down the [[High House of Stars]] and slew the Moonmaiden's protectors.

==Relationships==
He befriended a former [[bronze dragon]], [[Glyster]] (transformed by the priests into a [[shadow dragon]], who took the name [[Umbraxakar]]), who served as his companion, guide, and mount.
