        "mainbody": "ybor was a renowned spell-inventor, and the zulkir of enchantment in Thay during the 13 century DR. She was famous among the Red Wizards and beyond for the deviously wicked spell that bore her name.\nThe young zulkir was known as a particularly manipulative woman, who thoroughly enjoyed indulging in her magical whims. She was brash, wild and quite famous among mage circles.\nThe zulkir of enchantment was an avid spell developer, who tested new magic if ever given the opportunity, with seldom a care for the consequences. She readily shared her successful spells with other wizards far and wide, a trait that was rare among the Red Wizards, let alone a zulkir of Thay. She also dabbled in the art of magical item creation, preferring to focus on animated and intelligent weapons. She was known to have dreamed of an entire battlefield full of weapons, animated by the captured psyches of fallen enemy combatants.\nPerhaps Nybors strongest legacy to Toril was her personal spellbook, Nybors Small Codex. This tome was the only book attributed to the enchantress known to have ever left the borders of Thay. Its whereabouts were known by the intelligent dagger that possessed Nybors memories.\nNybor achieved the status of zulkir at an early age, by means of her network of servants, spies, assassins and the paramours she took in Thay. Beyond her arcane endeavors, little else was known about her life until her disappearance one night in 1296 DR. She reportedly left her mansion in the dead of night, leaving no instructions to her subordinates or contemporaries. She was replaced within the Council of Zulkirs some six months later.\nRumors about an enchanted dagger circulated following her death. This \"cursed\" blade was used to claim the lives of several notable people around Faer√ªn, including the adventurer Lerem \"the Lucky\" of Luskan, the Ilmatari paladin Saint Schend of Waterdeep and Maurgus the \"Black Bolt\" the Zhent assassin."
