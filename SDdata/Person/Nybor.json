        "mainbody": "'''Nybor''' was a renowned [[spell]]-inventor, and the [[zulkir]] of [[enchantment]] in [[Thay]] during the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was famous among the [[Red Wizards]] and beyond for the deviously wicked [[spell]] that bore her name.{{Cite web/Nybor's Small Codex}}",
        "Description": "The young zulkir was known as a particularly manipulative woman, who thoroughly enjoyed indulging in her magical whims. She was brash, wild and quite famous among mage circles.",
        "Activities": "The zulkir of enchantment was an avid spell developer, who tested new magic if ever given the opportunity, with seldom a care for the consequences. She readily shared her successful spells with other wizards far and wide, a trait that was rare among the Red Wizards, let alone a zulkir of Thay. She also dabbled in the art of magical item creation, preferring to focus on animated and [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] [[weapon]]s. She was known to have dreamed of an entire battlefield full of weapons, animated by the captured psyches of fallen enemy combatants.\n\nPerhaps Nybor's strongest legacy to Toril was her personal [[spellbook]], ''[[Nybor's Small Codex]]''. This tome was the only book attributed to the [[enchantress]] known to have ever left the borders of Thay. Its whereabouts were known by the intelligent dagger that possessed Nybor's memories.",
        "History": "Nybor achieved the status of zulkir at an early age, by means of her network of servants, spies, [[assassin]]s and the paramours she took in Thay. Beyond her arcane endeavors, little else was known about her life until her disappearance one night in [[1296 DR]]. She reportedly left her mansion in the dead of night, leaving no instructions to her subordinates or contemporaries. She was replaced within the [[Council of Zulkirs]] some six months later.\n\nRumors about an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[dagger]] circulated following her death. This \"cursed\" blade was used to claim the lives of several notable people around [[Faer√ªn]], including the adventurer [[Lerem|Lerem \"the Lucky\"]] of [[Luskan]], the [[Ilmatari]] [[paladin]] [[Schend|Saint Schend]] of [[Waterdeep]] and [[Maurgus|Maurgus the \"Black Bolt\"]] the [[Zhent]] assassin."
