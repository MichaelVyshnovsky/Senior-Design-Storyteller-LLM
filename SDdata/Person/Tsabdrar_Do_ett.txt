'''Tsabdrar Do'ett''' was a drow [[mage]] and retainer of [[House Auvryndar]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]], leading the outpost in the [[Troglodyte Warrens]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Tsabdrar's soldiers had captured many young [[troglodyte]] and he was pondering whether to kill all of them. He was also worried by a rampaging [[behir]] and was willing to promise the monster's hoard to any adventurer that could kill it.
