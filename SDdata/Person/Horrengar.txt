}}Horrengar arrived in [[Dragonscar Gorge]] with Shattercrown to excavate the ruins of Thrymstone in the late 15{{th}} century DR, and over several years, they forced the smaller creatures of the Frosthunger Horde into hard labor to achieve this. Just as they managed to enter the main gates of Thrymstone, their efforts came under attack by both the [[white dragon]]s of [[Kovanyrach]] and [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]]. As the adventurers invaded the fortress, Horrengar expressed disappointment that such successful enemies were so small. In the ensuing fight, Horrengar remained defiant as the adventurers broke his axe and forced him to surrender.
