'''Othlong Blackhelm''', known in legend as the '''Robber Lord''', was an [[adventurer]] and lord of the [[Keep of the Far Hills]] for a time.

==History==
Some time before the early 12{{th}} century [[DR]], Othlong and his fellow adventurers came upon an abandoned castle of [[giant]]-sized scale. Othlong claimed the castle as his own, and made it his home for a time.

Unfortunately, Othlong was betrayed by his ally [[Angarn Surfyst]], who seized the keep as his own.
