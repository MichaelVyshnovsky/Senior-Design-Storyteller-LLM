Othlong Blackhelm, known in legend as the Robber Lord, was an adventurer and lord of the Keep of the Far Hills for a time.
Some time before the early 12 century DR, Othlong and his fellow adventurers came upon an abandoned castle of giant-sized scale. Othlong claimed the castle as his own, and made it his home for a time.
Unfortunately, Othlong was betrayed by his ally Angarn Surfyst, who seized the keep as his own.
