        "History": "Cripakolus was the leader of the azer [[Everash Tribe]] in the Elemental Plane of Fire. However, most of his fellows were enslaved by the [[efreet]] of [[Hafiz al-Milhab]] to work in his mine. Thus, in 1373 DR, when his men captured [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and his allies, Cripakolus bargained with Kaanyr, offering them their freedom and to show them a passage to the [[City of Brass]], in exchange for destroying the efreet mine for azers."
