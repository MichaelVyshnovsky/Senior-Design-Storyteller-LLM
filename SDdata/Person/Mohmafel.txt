'''Mohmafel''' was an [[elf]] of unknown origin, desert-dwelling per [[Iahn Qoyllor]]'s judgement.While it appears to be strongly implied that Mohmafel is in fact one of the elves from [[Al Qahera]] that went missing when the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]] came back to the Realms, this is never outright stated. He was accompanying [[Deamiel]] during the latter's pursuit of [[Ususi Manaallin]] in the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, while both were under [[Pandorym]]'s influence. He was slain by a poisoned bolt fired by [[Iahn Qoyllor]]; at the time of death, he was wearing a long white gown and wielding a [[bow]].{{cite book/Darkvision|41-46|5}}
