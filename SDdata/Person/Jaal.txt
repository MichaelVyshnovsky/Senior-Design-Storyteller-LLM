Jaal was a stone giant living in Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, the Stonespeaker Hgraam may have sent Jaal to guide an expedition led by some adventurers, whod been hired by Bruenor Battlehammer to investigate the threat of a demon lord, to the mystic library of Gravenhollow.
Jaal had a mystical connection to the Underdark rocks and stopped often to touch the stones to commune with them, allowing him to find the quickest and safest path through the Underdark.
