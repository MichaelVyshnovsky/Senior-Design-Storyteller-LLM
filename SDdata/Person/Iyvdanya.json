        "mainbody": "'''Madame Iyvdanya''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Savras]] and fortune-teller in [[Skullport]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She ran the [[Madam Ivydanya's Fortunes Revealed]] business.",
        "History": "She hailed from [[Cormyr]], but was established in Skullport by [[1370 DR]].",
        "Home": "She rented and ran her trade out of a boxy two-story apartment in Skullport's [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] area. One floor was dedicated to the business and was in fair condition.",
        "Activities": "Iyvdanya predicted the fates and futures of those who came to her, and she did brisk business with the superstitious sailors and pirates who passed through the Port of Shadow. She charged according to a client's wealth, from 10 [[silver pieces]] to 5 [[gold pieces]] for a reading. Her techniques varied: she read palms, [[tea]] leaves, [[talis|cards]], oracle sticks, or even the patterns of wax droplets from a jiggled burning candle.\n\nIf she sensed bad fortune for a client—a common happening—she suggested a remedy based on folk traditions to ward off bad luck. One example was wearing clothes inside out for a [[tenday]]. In particularly bad cases, she sold a good-luck charm bearing the [[holy symbol]] of [[Tymora]] for 10 gold pieces (she had a deal with [[Ramora's Guile Shipping]] to get from [[Waterdeep]]) or else referred them to the [[Sisters Three Waxworks]] for one of theirs.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to her [[divine magic]] gained as a [[priest]]ess, Iyvdanya had some [[psionic]] powers as a wild talent. She was capable of ''[[aura sight]]'', ''[[object reading]]'', and ''[[precognition]]''.",
        "Description": "She was half-[[deaf]]."
