'''Dreb''' was a [[barbed devil]] in [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the city of [[Elturel]] was transported to Avernus in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, Dreb led a cast of [[giant crab]]s through the [[High Hall (Elturel)|High Hall]] cathedral. Though otherwise normal, these crabs had spiny shells and stank of brimstone.
