'''Pypyap''' or '''Pipyap''' was an [[imp]] [[familiar]] of [[Halvin Graingle]] in the [[Quivering Forest]] near [[Phlan]] in the late 1480s [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|14}}

==Personality==
Pypyap was a very friendly [[devil]], albeit ill-willed. He was honest in his dealings and talkative. He enjoyed being on [[Toril]] and he had no wish to go back to the [[Nine Hells]]. For this reason, he was also very cautious about being killed.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1485 DR]], Pipyap was in [[Maerimydra]] in the [[Underdark]], where he was harassed by some [[ogre]]s. He was saved by an adventuring party hired by [[Solom Ned'razak]] to collect some samples of blood from [[fiendborne]] [[fire giant]]s. Pipyap was grateful to the adventurers and helped guide them through the city.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|31}}

Pypyap was later summoned from the Nine Hells by Halvin Graingle, a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], to act as his familiar. ''Circa'' [[1489 DR]], he went with his master to the [[Kabel's Hill]] community in the Quivering Forest. After Halvin's disappearance, Pypyap went to ravage the local livestock. Here he was discovered by an adventuring party hired to find Halvin.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|12-13}}
