        "mainbody": "Julen Serrat was a young rogue and member of the Guardians branch of House Serrat of Delzimmer.  As the youngest son of his branch of the Serrats, Julen stood to inherit very little.  His father Ramul intended to apprentice him to one of his brothers who traded with drow and dwarves in the Underdark.\nJulen was trained by his family in skills such as lockpicking and poisoning.  Julen had some immunity to poisons because he took small doses of poisons daily from age four.  He was an accomplished knife fighter.\nJulen had a crush on his older cousin Zaltys and secretly wished to marry her,  which, because Zaltys was adopted, would have been legal according to Serrat family rules.\nIn 1479 DR Julen was sent into the jungles of Southern Faerûn with the Travelers branch of the Serrat clan to assist with the terazul harvest.  While in the jungle, Zaltys, a ranger and accomplished archer, taught him some of the basics of forest craft.\nZaltys learned that her birth clan may not have been slaughtered but rather imprisoned in the Underdark and decided to venture underground to find survivors.  Julen accompanied her and was captured by derro.  Julen escaped and was found by Zaltys and together the two traveled to the derro settlement.\nAt the derro settlement they confronted the derro leader the Slime King and she spiked Julens water with a poison.  Since Julen was immune to many poisons he shrugged it off and used a magic fey dagger to entwine the Slime King in vines.  Julen and Zaltys raced to the slave pens and freed the slaves.\nMeanwhile, Zaltys adopted mother Alaia Serrat and her guard captain Krailash had heard a psychic sending from Zaltys and had made their way to the derro village.  Krailash sacrificed himself by pushing the Slime King through a portal to the Far Realm, sealing the portal.\nJulens adventure into the Underdark convinced him that working underground wasnt for him so, rather than working for his brother trading with dwarves, he decided to run away from his family and travel with Zaltys through the Realms.\nCategoryRogues\nCategoryMembers of House Serrat\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Southeast Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Delzimmer\nCategoryHumans\n3nzrvf5b7a2njlfky7proah85fkflfs"
