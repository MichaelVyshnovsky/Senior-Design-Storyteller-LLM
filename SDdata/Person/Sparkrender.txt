'''Sparkrender''' was a [[blue dragon]] [[wyrmling]] active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was remarkably loathsome and dangerous for his age, and plotted to use the lingering [[spirit]]s of dead [[dragon]]s on [[Stormwreck Isle]] to grant himself [[god]]like power.
{{Quote|''[[Chromatic dragon]]s are the rightful rulers of this world. Bow down to the children of [[Tiamat]]!''|Sparkrender}}

==Description==
He was skinny for a blue wyrmling, and his scales glittered.

His roar sounded more like a screech, and when he spoke it sounded akin to barking and growling.

==Personality==
He was arrogant,

==Possessions==
Sparkrender had just begun to amass a hoard in the late 15{{th}} century DR, and many of his treasures were either mundane items that had caught his eye&mdash;notably he seemed fond of [[candlestick]]s&mdash;or gemstones that were blue in color, such as [[blue quartz]] and [[jasper|blue jasper]].

==Relationships==
[[Eldenemir]], a great blue dragon known as the "Raging Storm", had been Sparkrender's grandfather and was the inspiration in his quest for power. While Runara still dwelt on Stormwreck Isle at the time of Sparkrender's plot, she had sworn off violence since killing Eldenemir, and so did little to disrupt the evil wyrmling's plans.

Sparkrender had a following of [[kobold]]s on Stormwreck Isle, recruiting the ones who disagreed with the more peaceful way of life enjoyed by their kin at [[Dragon's Rest]]. While some of his minions were tasked with roving the island and attacking travelers,

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1481}}, Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle, the same site where his grandfather had attempted to harness the power of the island's fallen dragons a century prior.

}}The appointed time for the ritual was quite close by the time Sparkrender met his first major resistance&mdash;in the form of an attack by a [[bronze dragon]] wyrmling named [[Aidron]]&mdash;and by that time he had already been on the island for nearly a year, during which time he had amassed a following of more than a dozen kobold minions. Believing that he needed Aidron as a sacrifice to complete his ritual, he subdued the bronze wyrmling after failing to trick him into joining him. His kobold minions then set about completing the preparations for the ritual by building and painting crude sculptures of the five great dragons whom Sparkrender intended to bind: the great [[red dragon]] [[Sharruth]], the three [[metallic dragon]]s who defeated Sharruth long ago&mdash;[[Astalagan]], [[Clyssavar]], and [[Turadaer]]&mdash;and his own grandfather, Eldenemir.
