Lilac Hesabon was an elven adventurer and heroine active in the 14 century DR.
Lilac had neck-length blonde hair, pale white skin, and grey eyes. She wore a collared white blouse, black cape, and a red cap with a feather on it. Her ears were not very pointy compared to other elves.
She was a competent swimmer.
She was the owner of a dog called Lightning. Lightning was able to fight alongside Lilac or her allies. The dog was always ready to sacrifice itself in combat to protect others from any attack when commanded to.
