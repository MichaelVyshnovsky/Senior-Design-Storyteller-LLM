        "Personality": "Athan was an experienced and disciplined [[fighter]] who was burning with passion to avenge the folk affected by the ''pools''.",
        "Abilities": "Athan was highly capable in battle. He was able to use ranged weapons to land powerful point blank shots, and was a good sharpshooter. He had lightning-sharp combat reflexes, an iron will, and fortitude. He also was trained in blind fighting and powerful critical and cleaving attacks.",

        "History": "[[File:Athan in catacombs.png|thumb|''Athan, imprisoned in the Elven Catacombs under Myth Drannor.''|340x340px]]\nAthan's father, [[Garth]], was not a good man. In his youth he seduced a desperate [[elf|elven]] lass [[Jesenalae Stormlake]], only to get her pregnant and abandon her. The [[half-elf]] child was [[Ghleanna Stormlake]] who was raised by her cruel elven family after Jesenalae died in childbirth. Years later, Garth made a confession on his deathbed about the elven paramour he abandoned and about Athan's half-sister. Athan managed to find his family and took her away from the unloving home. Eventually, Athan's circle of friends introduced the young half-elf to Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale and Ghleanna Stormlake became his apprentice.{{Cite dragon annual/2000/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Myth Drannor|111}}\n\nIn 1369 DR, once inactive ''pool of radiance'' reappeared in the caves under [[Phlan]] starting drain the life force of the city's residents. Elminster Aumar, aware of similar ''pools'' across the [[Moonsea]] swiftly assembled the volunteers to stop whatever was causing it. He places a group of hero to guard the ''pool'' in Phlan, and sent another, with the hero Athan in charge to investigate the [[Cult of the Dragon]] activities in the ruins of Myth Drannor. Elminster entrusted Athan with the legendary [[Gauntlets of Moander|''Gauntlets of Moander'']] that stopped the corruption of the ''pool'' in Phlan a decade earlier.\n\nSoon after his expedition arrived to the ruins of Myth Drannor, the Cult forces ambushed the group, led by the [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]] himself, decimating the heroes. [[Faeril]] and [[Beriand]] were the only survivors of the massacre as the woman dragged the blind cleric out of the harm's way. Athan was dragged away by the Cult's [[dragonkin]], defeated, broken, stripped of the ''Gauntlets of Moander'' and abandoned in the Cult's prisons in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Eventually he was rescued and joined the second group of Elminster's adventurers, later known as the [[Veiled Ones]], who initially were the guardians of the ''pool'', but followed Athan's group through the portal. Together they defeated the cult leader [[Kya Mordrayn]] and destroyed Pelendralaar. They aided [[Anorrweyn Evensong]] in restoring the ''mythal'' over the city, and drained the accursed corrupted ''pools of radiance'' returning the Moonsea region to relative peace."
