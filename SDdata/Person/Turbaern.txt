'''Turbaern''' was one of the [[dwarves]] who would found the kingdom of [[Roldilar]] in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faer没n]] in the 7th century [[DR]]. Turbaern was a priest of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], holding the highest position of the faith, [[High Old One]], and the personal title '''"Blood Axe of Clangeddin"'''.

In the early 7th century, Turbaern enchanted over a thousand weapons forged from [[orcslayer]] metal by Master Smith [[Fyrfar Smokebeard]] over several years at the order of [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]], in their mission to destroy the [[orc]] realm of [[Vastar]]. Turbaern was assisted by the [[human]] mage [[Beldossan|Beldossan the Short]] and the [[elf|elven]] sorceress [[Aleratha Ilnatar]]. Among these was the [[short sword]] ''[[Sarghathuld]]'' in [[605 DR|the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}
