}}'''Filsaelene Merwyst''' was a [[sun elf]] cleric of [[Corellon Larethian]] rescued from captivity by the [[daemonfey]] in the ruins beneath [[Myth Glaurach]] by [[Araevin Teshurr]] and his party.

==Possessions==
Filsaelene carried a [[longsword]] and wore a [[breastplate]] bearing the symbol of Corellon Larethian.

==History==
While traveling to [[Elvenport]], Filsaelene's party was ambushed by [[fey'ri]] near [[Hellgate Keep]]. The entire company was slain except Filsaelene, who was spared to be used as breeding stock.

Later she joined for a time Araevin's party in their search to destroy the fey'ri. However she joined the [[Seiveril Miritar]]'s Crusade in the [[Cormanthor War]].
