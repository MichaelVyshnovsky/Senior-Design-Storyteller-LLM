Filsaelene Merwyst was a sun elf cleric of Corellon Larethian rescued from captivity by the daemonfey in the ruins beneath Myth Glaurach by Araevin Teshurr and his party.
Filsaelene carried a longsword and wore a breastplate bearing the symbol of Corellon Larethian.
While traveling to Elvenport, Filsaelenes party was ambushed by feyri near Hellgate Keep. The entire company was slain except Filsaelene, who was spared to be used as breeding stock.
Later she joined for a time Araevins party in their search to destroy the feyri. However she joined the Seiveril Miritars Crusade in the Cormanthor War.
