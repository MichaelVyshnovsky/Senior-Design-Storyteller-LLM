        "mainbody": "Kelgantor was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nKelgantor was decisive, and coldly ruthless.\nDuring the Tethgard raid, he was wielding two enchanted wands.\nHe was a War Wizard commander, often sent on killing missions.\nAccording to the Royal Magician Ganrahast Aeiulvana, the War Wizards sent on the Tethgard raid were Kelgantors \"wolves\". Those so-called wolves included Rorskryn Mreldrake, Shuldroon, Tethlor, Therlon, and Hondryn.\nKelgantor was a veteran War Wizard. On Mirtul 5 of the , when Ganrahast sent him after Elminster Aumar, a fugitive wizard who had just stolen the Royal Gorget of Battle. Kelgantor brought a large retinue of wizards and highknights with him to Tethgard, where Elminster had been tracked unknown to him, Storm Silverhand, an accomplice of Elminsters, had managed to sneak up on his squad at the last moment, knocking out Highknight Eskrel Starbridge. Nonetheless, they were able to sneak up on Elminster, who was accompanied by the former Queen of Aglarond, the mad sorceress known as the Simbul.\nHe stood back, took cover, and readied two wands, leaving the parley to Shuldroon, who stalled for a very long time, before striking. The combined spells and the wild magic at Tethgard caused their attacks to lead to an immense explosion, which soon blew up the ruins. Kelgantor, despite standing back, was decapitated by a fragment."
