On [[Mirtul 5]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, when Ganrahast sent him after [[Elminster Aumar]], a fugitive wizard who had just stolen the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]''. Kelgantor brought a large retinue of wizards and [[highknights]] with him to [[Tethgard]], where Elminster had been tracked; unknown to him, [[Storm Silverhand]], an accomplice of Elminster's, had managed to sneak up on his squad at the last moment, knocking out Highknight [[Eskrel Starbridge]]. Nonetheless, they were able to sneak up on Elminster, who was accompanied by the former Queen of [[Aglarond]], the mad sorceress known as [[the Simbul]].\n\nHe stood back, took cover, and readied two wands, leaving the parley to Shuldroon, who stalled for a very long time, before striking. The combined spells and the [[wild magic]] at Tethgard caused their attacks to lead to an immense explosion, which soon blew up the ruins. Kelgantor, despite standing back, was decapitated by a fragment."
