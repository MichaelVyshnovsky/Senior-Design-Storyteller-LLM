Ulan Zev was an albino Red Wizard of Thay necromancer residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.
Ulan Zev was busy doing magical research using as a laboratory the infirmary of Ironaxe Hall.
Ulan was irremediably evil. His dream was to become a lich together with his twin and serve Szass Tam for the eternity.
Ulan was one of the four apprentices of Arvik Zaltos. He had an imp familiar always at his side and was very close to his twin Luuthgar Zev.
Ulan and Luuthgar had a strange power they had a very strong psychic bond and always knew each others health. Most incredibly, if one of the twins died, his spirit could inhabit his brothers body like a phylactery and the surviving twin could grow a new body for the other from his own body.
