'''Sarrak of Westgate''' was a wizard in [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
He was aging and unlovely.

==Abilities==
He knew at least one spell that removed invisibility, almost certainly ''[[invisibility purge]]''. Other spells of his' protected his lord.

==Relationships==
He was a long-time hire of Lord Harkuldragon.

==History==
Sarrak hailed from [[Westgate]] but moved to [[Suzail]], where he became a wizard bodyguard of Lord [[Harkuldragon (Lord)|Harkuldragon]].

Around [[1479 DR]], after the [[Council of the Dragon]], while Harkuldragon and Sarrak conferred about the first's need to murder [[Khaladan Mallowfaer]] before he revealed some of Harkuldragon's treachery, [[Cymmarra]] blasted down the door to the room they were in, while invisible. Lord Harkuldragon demanded Sarrak cancel the intruder's invisibility, which he did; while he did, Cymmarra paralyzed him. She then killed Lord Harkuldragon, who fought her despite her insistence she was there for Sarrak alone.

Shortly after, she revealed she's heard Sarrak knew things about Orbakh of Westgate, a [[vampire]] and clone of [[Manshoon]], and so decided to mind-ream the man, despite him begging not to. After her mind-reaming, she blew up his head.
