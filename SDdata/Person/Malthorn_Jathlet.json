        "mainbody": "'''Malthorn Jathlet''' was a member of the [[Jathlet]] merchant family of [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. Not much was known about this mysterious mage, but rumors about the Jathlets spoke of kidnapping important individuals and permanently altering their physical appearance so they could be turned into slaves without anyone being the wiser. If the rumors were true, Malthorn's skill in [[necromancy]] was a likely source for this kind of manipulation of faces and body parts."
