'''Alven Gissen''' was a sculptor from [[Waterdeep]] around [[1485 DR]].

==Possessions==
Alven wore a holy symbol of Amaunator given to him by Luc Sunbright.

==Activities==
Alven was hired by [[Luc Sunbright]] to work on the [[Morninglow Tower]] in [[Daggerford]]. While working there, he lodged at the [[Silver Flood Inn]] and passed his free time with the courtesan [[Pencheska|Natyssa]].

==History==
In 1485 DR, while employed at Morninglow Tower, he was hired by [[Jekk Ironfist]] to make a replica of the [[Face of Gorm|Delimbyr Bloke]], which Jekk believed to be a [[dwarvish]] artifact.

Alven told Natyssa about his work on the replica and she decided to steal the Bloke for her [[Red Wizard]] masters. Natyssa enthralled him to deliver it to [[Harpshield Castle]], then turned him over to a group of [[Wartsnak]]'s [[orcs]].

At Harpshield Castle, Wartsnak killed Alven and raised him as a [[zombie]].
