'''Jeremi Laski''' was a wine and spirits vendor who lived in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|56}}

==Description==
Jeremi was a large man, standing {{SI|6'6"|ft-in}} tall.

==Personality==
Jeremi never carried a weapon because he could talk his way out of nearly any situation. He enjoyed proposing drinking contests in which he was unbeatable.

==Activities==
Jeremi owned a few stalls in the [[Grand Bazaar]] and a small storage facility in the [[Warehouse District of Huzuz]]. His main shop, however, was located in the [[Court District]]. His vineyards were located south of the city proper.

His wines and brandies were popular among the wealthy of Huzuz. Much of this was due to Jeremi's dealings with [[winemaker genie]]s.

Jeremi excelled at making [[Heart of Wine]].
