'''Karp''' was a struggling farmer from a failing plot of land in the town of [[Nashkel]] ''circa'' midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By [[1368 DR]], Karp felt extremely discouraged by her failing farm but looked at the bright side of not being a miner during the infamous [[iron crisis]] of the Sword Coast. She feared for the lives and very souls of struggling miners who were rumored to be raked and dragged into the depths of the dreaded [[Nashkel mines]] by [[baatezu]]. Even though Karp was relatively safe working the fields, she faced the prospect of her family going broke. The earth was upturned from the previous year's harvest and baked hard by the sun. The farm was so tough no plow could work the land. Karp's son tried to plant the crop by pushing seeds into cracked earth, but the future looked grim. Karp was sure she was bound to move to slums of [[Athkatla]].
