'''Neely''' was a [[cheese]]maker and the proprietor of [[Neely's Cheese]] store in the Living District of [[Arrabar]], on the [[Slake Street]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Neely was a kind man who felt protective of his young employee [[Mirolyn Skolotti]] and her blind, aging mother â€“ [[Nimra Skolotti]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, a sister of Neely's employee Mirolyn Skolotti, was murdered by supposed members of the [[Municipal Guard of Arrabar]] who claimed she was falsely advertising herself as a [[wizard]] via forehead markings. Several days after the young woman's death, [[Vambran Matrell]] paid a visit to Neely's store, seeking to speak about Mirolyn's sister in privacy. The cheesemaker allowed Nimra and Mirolyn Skolotti to use his private quarters above the store. The conversation aided Vambran's investigation of the commoner's unjust death.
