Erin Three-Toes was a halfling criminal from Elturel.
Clad in spiked leather armor and wielding a sword and shield, Erin had a symmetrical face, fair skin, and light brown hair.
In addition to her armor, Erin owned a magical pair of gloves of missile snaring.
Erin was raised by her uncle, who wished for her to become a thief. However, Erin had a violent streak, causing her to end up in a fight with a large human during her first heist. After losing two toes in that entanglement, Erin vowed to work on her fighting skills in addition to her abilities as a thief. She planned to leave Elturel in favor of a bigger city.
