        "mainbody": "Batina al-Shaat was a moralist priest of Hajama and the leader of the Preachers in 1367 DR.\nBatina was a rogue compared to other moralist priests in Zakhara. Moralists typically did not support the use of holy slayers to strike down enemies of their god. Batina held no such qualms.\nShe smiled often when dealing with her followers, but her smile was not pleasant.\nBatina guided assassins to strike down anyone she felt was an enemy, including other members of the Everlasting.\nShe advised the Shadow Caliph on all matters regarding the faith, yet she did not have any designs on leading the Everlasting. She viewed her current position as having just as much power without the constant risk that the Shadow Caliph faced.\nBatina was enemies with Emir Hatit Abd al-Wajib, who once spurned her for a position of power in Qudra. She never forgave him for the sleight.\nBatina owned a magical short sword, a bag containing powder of the heros heart, and a shield of the holy."
