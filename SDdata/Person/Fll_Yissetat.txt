FllYissetat was a fairly powerful female green dragon who acted as an unwilling guardian for Abazigals lair, having been geased into service. The key to unlocking the geas was a scroll of reversal kept in the desk of Iycanth.
The green dragon owned Abazigals wardstone and an enchanted trinket called The Specters Ring.
Gorions Ward reached the dragons chamber, and noticed that within her eyes, was a great suffering, as if she was in unfathomable pain. FllYissetat recognised the ward as a Bhaalspawn, and asked to be freed. In order to reach Abazigal, had to either release FllYissetat, in which case she left, or fight her. Either way, she wished for the ward to kill the "mongrel half-breed" that kept her geased for so long.
