        "mainbody": "'''Kossaandar''' was a [[shadowslain]] [[Blackscale]] [[lizardfolk]] fighter and warchief of the [[Shadowscale]] tribe in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Kossaandar was formerly of the Blackscale tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] before being taken and made into a Shadowscale. He became a loyal follower of [[Ketsarra Shadowscale]] and served as her warchief.\n\nIn early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] presumably destroyed Kossaandar as they dealt with the Shadowscales and their [[Shar]]ran allies. After his defeat, the remaining Shadowscales scattered across the Shadow Swamp, a tribe no more.",
        "Activities": "In Ketsarra's absence, Kossaandar led the Shadowscales at their [[Shadowscale Warren|warren]] in the Shadow Swamp. He held court from the so-called Great Warren and dwelled in the chief's den with its riches. He was advised by the [[banelar]] [[Isti-Zar]], who'd been sent to the warren by [[Despayr]].",
        "Description": "Being a Blackscale, Kossaandar was a hulking great lizard-man as big as an [[ogre]] and powerfully muscled. As a shadowslain, shadows clung about his torso and limbs.",
        "Powers": "Kossaandar had the powers of a Blackscale and of a shadowslain undead and was a powerful master of the [[greatsword]].",
        "Personality": "Kossaandar was fierce and utterly loyal to Ketsarra.",
        "Possessions": "Kossaandar wielded a ''+1 greatsword'', wore a [[breastplate]], and carried five [[javelin]]s."
