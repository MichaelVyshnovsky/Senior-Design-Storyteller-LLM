When her scrivening business was slow, she enjoyed closing her shop, disguising herself with magic, and roaming the caravanserai and [[Warehouse District of Huzuz|Warehouse District]] selling false \"relics\" to foolish customers. Some of these items included chips of bone from the first [[Grand Caliph]], scraps of the original scrolls of the [[Loregiver]], and pieces of the [[House of the Loregiver]]. Zaynal used her skills to supply forged documents, all signed by [[Renn min Zann]], to authenticate her wares."
