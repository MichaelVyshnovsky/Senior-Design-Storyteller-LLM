'''Savengriff''' (pronounced SAY-ven-griff) was an apprentice [[wizard]] of [[Khelben Arunsun]] before he helped to refound [[the Covenant]].

==Description==
Savengriff was described as a gaunt man with pale skin and an unremarkable face. He possessed dark brown hair, a beard, and hazel eyes.

==Personality==
Savengriff was loyal to Khelben and was always prepared to be attacked.

==History==
Savengriff was regarded as the weakest member of the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] but he was personally recruited by Khelben to be a member of that band in the hopes of grooming him for the [[Harpers]]. At one point, he and fellow Venturer [[Tzarrakyn]] were both killed in a fight with a [[beholder]].<ref> Savengriff's body was left in the beholder's lair but Khelben used a necklace he had gifted to him to discover the body's location, then led a sortie into the lair with [[Durnan]], [[Mirt]], [[Nymara Scheiron|Kitten]], [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]], [[Shalar Simgulphin]], and several of Khelben's mage apprentices to retrieve it, killing the beholder as well. Khelben asked some [[cleric]] allies to bring Savengriff back from the dead, which earned him Savengriff's loyalty.

Savengriff became Khelben's apprentice and a member of the Harpers under Khelben's sponsorship.{{Cite dragon/102/Nine Wands of Wonder|30-31}} also known as a ''staff of banishment''.

Eventually, some time after having created over a dozen ''wands of banishment'', Although he still had friends in the Harpers and [[Moonstars]], he ceased working for either. Instead, he began the process of recruiting wizards to join his resurgent Covenant.

*''[[A Palace Life]]'' (year unknown)
*''[[Swords, Spells, Splendor]]'' ([[1355 DR]]) (about Khelben and Laeral)
*''[[City of Mages]]'' ([[1381 DR]])

==Possessions==

==Relationships==
