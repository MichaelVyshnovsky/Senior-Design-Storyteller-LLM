Savengriff (pronounced SAY-ven-griff) was an apprentice wizard of Khelben Arunsun before he helped to refound the Covenant.
Savengriff was described as a gaunt man with pale skin and an unremarkable face. He possessed dark brown hair, a beard, and hazel eyes.
Savengriff was loyal to Khelben and was always prepared to be attacked.
Savengriff was regarded as the weakest member of the Company of Crazed Venturers but he was personally recruited by Khelben to be a member of that band in the hopes of grooming him for the Harpers. At one point, he and fellow Venturer Tzarrakyn were both killed in a fight with a beholder. Savengriffs body was left in the beholders lair but Khelben used a necklace he had gifted to him to discover the bodys location, then led a sortie into the lair with Durnan, Mirt, Kitten, Piergeiron, Shalar Simgulphin, and several of Khelbens mage apprentices to retrieve it, killing the beholder as well. Khelben asked some cleric allies to bring Savengriff back from the dead, which earned him Savengriffs loyalty.
Savengriff became Khelbens apprentice and a member of the Harpers under Khelbens sponsorship. also known as a staff of banishment.
Eventually, some time after having created over a dozen wands of banishment, Although he still had friends in the Harpers and Moonstars, he ceased working for either. Instead, he began the process of recruiting wizards to join his resurgent Covenant.
