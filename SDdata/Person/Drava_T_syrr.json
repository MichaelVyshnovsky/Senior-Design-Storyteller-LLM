        "mainbody": "'''Drava T'syrr''' was a [[drow]] warrior in [[Cormanthor]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|17}}",
        "History": "Drava lived in [[Szith Morcane]] until it fell to [[fiendish]] [[fire giant]]s ''circa'' [[1486 DR]]. She led eight companions to Cormanthor. There, however, she fell under the madness of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] and started to dance and drink.\n\nSome adventurers (members of the [[Harpers]] hired by [[Elanil Elassidil]] to bring peace to her ancestor [[Meira Faerenduil]]) tried to convince Drava and her companions to go to a refugee camp but she never complied and in the end she was defeated.{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|18-19}}",
        "Personality": "Drava fell completely to Graz'zt's madness, in particular giving herself over to hedonistic impulses, drinking and singing. She was fearful of surface-dwellers, convinced that any meeting would inevitably end in bloodshed.",
        "Relationships": "Drava always had at her side her second-in-command, the mage [[Ilztoj A'Qaran]]."
