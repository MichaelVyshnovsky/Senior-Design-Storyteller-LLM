        "mainbody": "Drava Tsyrr was a drow warrior in Cormanthor in the late 15 century DR.\nDrava lived in Szith Morcane until it fell to fiendish fire giants circa 1486 DR. She led eight companions to Cormanthor. There, however, she fell under the madness of the demon lord Grazzt and started to dance and drink.\nSome adventurers (members of the Harpers hired by Elanil Elassidil to bring peace to her ancestor Meira Faerenduil) tried to convince Drava and her companions to go to a refugee camp but she never complied and in the end she was defeated.\nDrava fell completely to Grazzts madness, in particular giving herself over to hedonistic impulses, drinking and singing. She was fearful of surface-dwellers, convinced that any meeting would inevitably end in bloodshed.\nDrava always had at her side her second-in-command, the mage Ilztoj AQaran."
