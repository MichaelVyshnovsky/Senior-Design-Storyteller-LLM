        "mainbody": "Shaness was a crewmember aboard the hammership, the Probe. He served as one of the five people manning the aft catapult.\nShandess was one of the oldest persons aboard the Probe. He was old but still tough. He had thin arms but with corded muscles.\nBy the time that he first met Teldin Moore, bearer of the Cloak of the First Pilot, Shandess had been a long-time veteran of space travel, having crossed into the flow more than 60 times.\nOn the journey from Krynn to Toril, the Probe was attacked by a neogi deathspider while in the flow. Shandess was the first person to spot the approaching enemy vessel.\nDuring the battle, the spidership pinned the smaller vessel in its grappling ram, and the Probe was boarded by human and demihuman slaves and raging umber hulks. The vessel eventually broke free and flew to safety, but at some point during the battle, Shandess had been severely wounded and fell overboard.\nThe unfortunate man was recovered by the neogi and taken aboard the Void Reaper, where he was stripped naked and bound to a table in a cramped red-lit room. He was given a potion to heal his wounds and bring him back to consciousness and was interrogated by the master of the vessel, Prissith Nerro and its brood-brother Prissith Ulm. Nerro demanded to know of the magic cloak and to where the Probe was heading. Shandess did not know anything about the cloak but did reveal that the hammerships destination was Realmspace. Prissith Nerro then ate Shandess alive."
