        "mainbody": "'''Shaness''' was a crewmember aboard the [[hammership]], the ''[[Probe]]''. He served as one of the five people manning the aft [[catapult]].",
        "Description": "Shandess was one of the oldest persons aboard the ''Probe''. He was old but still tough. He had thin arms but with corded muscles.",
        "History": "By the time that he first met [[Teldin Moore]], bearer of the [[Cloak of the First Pilot]], Shandess had been a long-time veteran of space travel, having crossed into the [[Phlogiston|flow]] more than 60 times.\n\nOn the journey from [[Krynn]] to [[Toril]], the ''Probe'' was attacked by a [[neogi deathspider]] while in the flow. Shandess was the first person to spot the approaching enemy vessel.\n\nDuring the battle, the spidership pinned the smaller vessel in its grappling ram, and the ''Probe'' was boarded by [[human]] and [[demihuman]] slaves and raging [[umber hulk]]s. The vessel eventually broke free and flew to safety, but at some point during the battle, Shandess had been severely wounded and fell overboard.\n\nThe unfortunate man was recovered by the [[neogi]] and taken aboard the ''[[Void Reaper]]'', where he was stripped naked and bound to a table in a cramped red-lit room. He was given a [[potion]] to heal his wounds and bring him back to consciousness and was interrogated by the master of the vessel, [[Prissith Nerro]] and its brood-brother [[Prissith Ulm]]. Nerro demanded to know of the magic cloak and to where the ''Probe'' was heading. Shandess did not know anything about the cloak but did reveal that the hammership's destination was [[Realmspace]]. Prissith Nerro then ate Shandess alive."
