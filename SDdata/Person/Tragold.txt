'''Tragold''' was a scout that worked for [[Company Yargo]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was stationed about the ship captained by [[Shil Yargo]], known as ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]''.

{{Quote|Now that they're out of the way, I can go down there without risking my neck.}}

==Personality==
While he lived a dangerous life as a forward scout, Tragold was not one to needlessly put his like in danger and was actually quite fearful at times.

==History==
When the ''Buccaneer's Tear'' landed upon the [[earthmote]] of [[Pirates' Skyhold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, it touched down near [[Vilebog]] swamp that said to hold the ruins of another skyship, the ''[[Magister's Hope]]''. Tragold was tasked with setting up a forward camp and wading through the swamp to recover any useful wreckage. While it proved to be a futile undertaking, he did however discover the [[Scalefather's Hollow]], the den of an [[Scalefather|enspecially powerful lizardman]] [[shaman]]. Tragold enlisted the aid of the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to defeat the monstrous creature and lessen the aggressive actions taken by his followers.
