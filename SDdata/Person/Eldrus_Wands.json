        "mainbody": "'''Eldrus Wands''' was a mage of the 4{{th}} and 5{{th}} centuries [[DR]], the [[Magister]] from [[409 DR]] to [[516 DR]], and the founder of the famous [[Wands]] noble house of [[Waterdeep]].",

        "Personality": "As an old man, he was good-natured, interested more in jokes than wealth or power and using his magic for kindness.",
        "Activities": "Eldrus focused primarily on protecting himself, and he maintained many houses and disguises around the [[Realms]]. He traveled regularly and randomly, albeit relatively calmly, between his homes and hideouts. \n\nEldrus was a romantic who found lovers in all the places he went. He housed each of these women in cottages and established them as soothsayers or shopkeepers dealing in magical novelties. After he went away, he magically spied on them, but did so in order to protect them from evil-doers and provide them with money and resources, such as minor magical items like ''[[continual light]]'' lamps and scrolls with new spells of his invention, each left anonymously on their doorsteps.\n\nIf any of his lovers had a child with him, Eldrus would send dreams with suggested names for his sons and daughters, both given name and the Wands surname. These children grew to be strong in [[sorcery]]."
