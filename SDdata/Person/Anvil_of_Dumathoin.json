        "mainbody": "The '''Anvil of Dumathoin''' was a powerful [[iron golem]] constructed by the [[dwarves]] of [[Frostsilver Mines]] and stored in a secret room in their deepest and most hidden forge. Its creators considered it to be sacred to [[Dumathoin]], the [[Morndinsamman|dwarven god]] of secrets, until it went berserk.",
        "Description": "The \"Anvil\" was a massive, dwarf-shaped iron golem that behaved erratically owing to the fact that it was animated by the trapped spirit of an [[earth elemental]], likely one with a connection to the equally erratic elemental known as the [[Soul of Frostsilver]].",
        "Abilities": "The Anvil was extremely durable and resilient. In combat, it would dislodge bounders to fall on its opponents, thus causing a great deal of damage to the Mines in which it fought. It also wielded a massive sword, could spew [[poison]] at any foes who got too close, and could project a column of [[fire]].",
        "History": "The Anvil of Dumathoin was responsible for the violent catastrophe that wiped out the dwarves of Frostsilver Mines when it went on a rampage. So complete and brutal was this event that it led to many of the dwarves returning as [[Frostsilver's Rage|wrathful undead]], and the truth of what happened became lost amid tales that Mines were merely cursed. However, some tales did persist of a powerful object sacred to Dumathoin.\n\nThese tales led a [[hobgoblin]] warlord named [[Mrolgyet]] to send his agents&mdash;[[Grocknock]] and [[Snarlclaw]]&mdash;to tunnel into the Mines and claim the Anvil. Using [[troll]]s to dig and [[rust monster]]s to eat through metal doors, they nearly reached the secret room in which it was housed before the arrival of [[adventurer]]s in the service of [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]]. Realizing that the Anvil would be a danger if it fell into the clutches of [[Mrolgyet's Legion]], these adventurers thwarted the efforts to claim the golem and then battled the [[construct]] itself.\n\nDespite having been defeated by the adventurers, the golem proved difficult to destroy, and could reanimate to rampage through the abandoned Frostilver Mine again."
