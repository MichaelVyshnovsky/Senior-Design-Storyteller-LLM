The bodies of the enemy piled high around the brave combatants, but all eventually succumbed to their injuries.\n\nIn his final moments, Theodo shattered his magical weapon, [[Greataxeson]], upon the bridge, cracking it in the center, before charging the enemy with only the handle of his weapon.\n\nAll eight of the dwarves who perished upon the bridge returned as [[undead]] to stand guard there for all time."
