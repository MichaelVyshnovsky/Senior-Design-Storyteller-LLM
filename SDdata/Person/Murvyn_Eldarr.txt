==Description==
In [[Mirtul]] of {{yearlink|1334}}, he had the beginnings of some stubble during a meeting with Lord [[Chess]].{{cite book/Realms of Infamy/So High a Price}}

==History==
In Mirtul of 1334 DR, he joined a meeting with Lord Chess, where he asked him about a maid the latter had bedded. Per Chess' recollection, that was actually the [[Shadowsil]].

==Reputation==
Per [[Manshoon]]'s appreciation in the {{yearlinkName|1334}}, Lord Murvyn Eldarr was a self-entitled, witless, irresponsible caricature of an old nobleman who could be safely ignored and crushed just as safely.
