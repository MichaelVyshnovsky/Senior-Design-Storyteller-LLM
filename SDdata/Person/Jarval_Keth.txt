'''Jarval Keth''' was a [[Mulan]] {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|3}}  explorer. He discovered the symbol marking the entrance to the hidden [[Imaskari]] level in [[Maskana]]. {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|2}} 

After finding an unusual version of the crescent and the fox pictographs in Maskana, Jarval researched these symbols at [[Gheldaneth]], first asking around in the temples, and then in the Great University. {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|4}}  Jarval had barely managed to escape [[Sithena Tinzon]], Tyaral's chief inquisitor, by boarding a ship.

Jarval managed to blurt out a few clues to some adventurers before Sithena Tinzon found him. He might've survived the fight that almost certainly ensued; if so, only a ''[[heal]]'' spell could've cured the mental sequels of his torture. {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|2-3}}  Should those adventurers have defeated Tyaral at Maskana, he was likely to have hired them to explore the lower levels of the ruin. {{cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|8}}
