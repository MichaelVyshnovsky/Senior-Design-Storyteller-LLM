'''Shala Karanok''' was a ruler of [[Chessenta]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When [[Tchazzar]] returned in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Shala relinquished the throne and became a minor dignitary in Tchazzar's court.

In order to divert suspicion from [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]], Shala took the blame for the sabotage of Tchazzar's supplies and he threw her in the dungeon. She was rescued by Chessentan nobles at the start of the [[Battle of Luthcheq]] and she returned to kill Tchazzar after he had been weakened by Jhesri's magic.

Shala reclaimed the throne of Chessenta and reimposed restrictions on [[mage]]s.

==Description==
At the time, Shala was middle-aged and solidly built with a square jaw and dark hair. She preferred to wear masculine clothing.
