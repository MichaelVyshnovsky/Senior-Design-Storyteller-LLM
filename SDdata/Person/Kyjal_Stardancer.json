        "mainbody": "Kyjal Stardancer was a star elf who became the most promising apprentice of Mourel Duskwalker.\nKyjal was the only survivor of the defeat of his master. He fell into the sea below Tirintiral and was presumed dead. Once that part of SildÃ«yuir was cut off and became the Night Realm, Kyjal found his masters corpse and extracted his brain. He placed the brain in a jar of embalming fluid and then the jar into a chest cavity he had made in a Girallon. Then, using a technique Mourel had been working on, Kyjal animated the brain. Kyjal helped his master animate all of the corpses in the Night Realm and aided with Mourels experiments for the rest of his life before trying to make himself a lich so he could serve Mourel forever.\nThe process succeeded in killing him, but he didnt come back as a lich. Instead, he became a Deathlock with absolutely no memory of his past. Carving a hole in his head, he placed the remains of his spellbook, a partially shattered Kings Tear inside so that he could still cast spells, but spent most of his time in a maceration vat.\nKyjal was finally killed by adventurers while they battled through the Night Realm on a quest."
