Immaero Sraunter was an alchemist in Suzail in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Around 1479 DR, Manshoon managed to discover his hidden secrets and enslaved Sraunter to do his bidding. He ordered the alchemist to release into the city five death tyrants.
Later, Manshoon magically sent Sraunter inyo the besieged Stormserpent Towers.
In 1480 DR, he was dealing with Lord Danthalus Blacksilver.
Later, Manshoon decided to possess Sraunter and use him as his main body.
