Severin was a doomguide of Kelemvor in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.
Severin was part of the Doomguide Volahks contingent of priests and acolytes acolytes who entered Neverdeath Graveyard and disappeared within. In truth, the group was ambushed and assaulted by many undead guided by Red Wizards, in an area known as the Rift. 
After their disappearance, Volahk recruited an adventurer to help find them. Severin was still alive within crypt under the watch of a sole Red Wizard. Once Severin was rescued, the adventurer was given enough information that they could continue the search for the other doomguides that were yet unaccounted for.
