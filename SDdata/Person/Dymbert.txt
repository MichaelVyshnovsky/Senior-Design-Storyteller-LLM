Dymbert, called Bluenail by her Sharran cloister, was a novice in the hidden Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Dymbert was a young dwavish woman with an olive skin tone, long wavy brown hair, and a clean-shaven face.
Dymbert retained a relationship with her mother after joining the Cloister of Sombre Embrace. Unlike many of her sisters and brothers, Dymbert seemed to had lost her resolve after witnessing the cruelties of the church and attending an interrogation class that made Dymbert vomit. The dwarf regretted not listening to her mother and was afraid that the Mother Superior was aware of Dymberts weakness.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Bluenail served the Mother Superior Viconia DeVir in the underground Cloister of Sombre Embrace as one of her cultists underneath the House of Grief. Bluenail, along with the entirety of the cloister may have confronted its rogue member named Shadowheart, were she to turn away from Shar. Bluenail could have perished in the struggle. By other accounts, Bluenail and the rest of the cloister helped defend the city of Baldurs Gate from the army of the Absolute, were Shadowheart to remain loyal to her evil deity, or if Shadowheart was betrayed and surrendered to the Mother Superior for punishment.
