'''Dymbert''', called '''Bluenail''' by her [[Sharran]] cloister, was a novice in the hidden [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Dymbert was a young [[dwarf|dwavish]] woman with an olive skin tone, long wavy brown hair, and a clean-shaven face.

==Relationships==
Dymbert retained a relationship with her mother after joining the Cloister of Sombre Embrace. Unlike many of her sisters and brothers, Dymbert seemed to had lost her resolve after witnessing the cruelties of the church and attending an interrogation class that made Dymbert vomit. The dwarf regretted not listening to her mother and was afraid that the Mother Superior was aware of Dymbert's weakness.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Bluenail served the Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir]] in the underground Cloister of Sombre Embrace as one of her cultists underneath the [[House of Grief]]. Bluenail, along with the entirety of the cloister may have confronted its rogue member named [[Shadowheart]], were she to turn away from Shar. Bluenail could have perished in the struggle. By other accounts, Bluenail and the rest of the cloister helped defend the city of Baldur's Gate from the army of the [[Absolute]], were Shadowheart to remain loyal to her evil deity, or if Shadowheart was betrayed and surrendered to the Mother Superior for punishment.
