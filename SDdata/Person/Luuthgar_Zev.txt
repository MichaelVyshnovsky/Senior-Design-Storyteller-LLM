}}'''Luuthgar Zev''' was an [[albino]] [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[necromancer]] residing in [[Illefarn]] around [[1480 DR]].
==History==
Luuthgar Zev was busy doing magical research in the northeast area of Ironaxe Hall. However, he went to [[Laughing Hollow]] after he heard of a great fire there and recovered the bodies of several beings in order to use for experiments.

==Personality==
Luuthgar was irremediably evil. His dream was to become a [[lich]] together with his twin and serve [[Szass Tam]] for eternity.
==Relationship==
Luuthgar was one of the four apprentices of [[Arvik Zaltos]]. He was very close to his twin [[Ulan Zev]].

==Powers==
Ulan and Luuthgar had a strange power: they had a very strong psychic bond and always knew each other's health. Most incredibly, if one of the twins died, his spirit could inhabit his brother's body like a [[phylactery]] and the surviving twin could grow a new body for the other from his own body.
