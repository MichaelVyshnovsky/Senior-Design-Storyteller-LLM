Luuthgar Zev was an albino Red Wizard of Thay necromancer residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.
Luuthgar Zev was busy doing magical research in the northeast area of Ironaxe Hall. However, he went to Laughing Hollow after he heard of a great fire there and recovered the bodies of several beings in order to use for experiments.
Luuthgar was irremediably evil. His dream was to become a lich together with his twin and serve Szass Tam for eternity.
Luuthgar was one of the four apprentices of Arvik Zaltos. He was very close to his twin Ulan Zev.
Ulan and Luuthgar had a strange power they had a very strong psychic bond and always knew each others health. Most incredibly, if one of the twins died, his spirit could inhabit his brothers body like a phylactery and the surviving twin could grow a new body for the other from his own body.
