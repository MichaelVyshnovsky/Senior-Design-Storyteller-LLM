Sathariel was a dark angel in the service of the evil deity Asmodeus.  His exact nature was unknown and, although he was described as a dark angel, he may in fact have been a devil.  Alternatively, he could have been a fallen angel.
Sathariel had black feathers on his wings and his body was shrouded in darkness.
He had silver armor and wielded a silver sword.
Sathariel lived in Waterdeep and oversaw the operations of the Vigilent Order.  In 1480 DR, he attempted to complete the ritual of the First Flensing, a spell that would have opened a gate to the Prime Material Plane for Asmodeus use.  He was slain by the deva Jinnaoth IrGadohn in 1480.
