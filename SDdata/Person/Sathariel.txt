'''Sathariel''' was a dark [[Angel (astral)|angel]] in the service of the [[evil]] [[deity]] [[Asmodeus]].  His exact nature was unknown and, although he was described as a dark angel, he may in fact have been a devil.  Alternatively, he could have been a fallen angel.

==Description==
Sathariel had black feathers on his wings and his body was shrouded in darkness.

==Possessions==
He had silver armor and wielded a silver [[sword]].

==History==
Sathariel lived in [[Waterdeep]] and oversaw the operations of the [[Vigilent Order]].  In [[1480 DR]], he attempted to complete the ritual of the [[First Flensing]], a spell that would have opened a gate to the [[Prime Material Plane]] for Asmodeus' use.  He was slain by the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Jinnaoth Ir'Gadohn]] in 1480.
