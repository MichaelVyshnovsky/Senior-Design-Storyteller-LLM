'''Sansuki''' was a [[fighter]] member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] in [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sansuki was a pale-skinned [[human]] male who was dressed in gray garb and simple thieves' leathers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the criminal underbelly of Athkatla erupted in an all-out guild wars between the Shadow Thieves and a [[vampire]] coven under [[Bodhi]]. Sansuki was one of many thieves killed in the war. He was pursued by vampires led by [[Del (vampire)|Del]] across the night streets of Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Scepter District|Scepter District]]. Once Del coughed up with the man, Sansuki's fate was sealed.
