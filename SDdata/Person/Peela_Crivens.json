        "mainbody": "'''Peela Crivens''' was one of the inhabitants of [[Reithwin]], the town that once venerated [[Selûne]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Peela Crivens perished in a tragic event sometime before the fall of Reithwin, before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, and before it was consumed by the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]]. The event took the lives of Peela, [[Brent Crivens|Brent]], and almost every member of the Crivens clan, including the family [[dog]] – [[Patch]], outlived only by [[Errick Crivens]], who was, in some way, the cause of the tragedy. Peela was buried in Reithwin's graveyard behind the [[House of Healing]] in a cluster surrounded by the graves of her family. Her tombstone read: \"Dedicated to Peela Crivens, taken along with her family on the same grim night. May their deaths be avenged.\" The Crivens family's grave markers remained relatively undamaged and legible as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
