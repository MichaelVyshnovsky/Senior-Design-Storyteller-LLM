        "mainbody": "Ipswitch was a human patron of the Elfsong Tavern in Baldurs Gate around 1372 DR.\nIpswitch was the father of at least one child.\nIpswitch came to the city because he wished to visit the Shrine of Suffering run by the priests of Ilmater. His purpose in visiting the shrine was to pay his respects to his brother, who had been buried in the crypts along with a family medallion Ipswitch wished to retrieve. The medallion was intended to be passed through his familys generations and he sought to give it to his child. However, the shrine was closed and no one answered his summons.\nSince his visit to Baldurs Gate, all he could do was drink and wait for the shrine to reopen. Seated at a table near the Elfsong Taverns entrance, Ipswitch greeted the adventurers Adrianna, Vahn, and Kromlech. He welcomed the trios company and asked what brought them to Baldurs Gate. After hearing of the trios misfortune with thieves during their arrival, Ipswitch offered his sympathies and mentioned that he was also a stranger in town, explaining his own troubles.\nOnce the trio completed their mission in the catacombs beneath Baldurs Gate and returned with Ipswitchs medallion, he rewarded them by giving them his mace."
