Vatilan was a shadow demon of the Abyss that ventured into the Nine Hells in the late 15 century DR.
In 1494 DR, Vatilan was part of a group of demons led by a nalfeshnee called Trantolox who was searching for the Bleeding Citadel. During their journey, Vatilan discovered Crokektoeck, the lost pet of Yeenoghu, buried inside the Scab. Vatilan remained there to direct five dretchs to liberate Crokektoeck.
