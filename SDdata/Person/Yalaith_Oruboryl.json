        "mainbody": "Lady Yalaith Oruboryl was a beloved socialite and thief in Thentia in the 13 and 14 centuries DR.\nLady Yalaith was the only publicly tolerated professional thief in Thentia, who earned the adoration of the city with her high-profile and risqué crimes. The Lady Thief of the Parties would seduce a paramour at a social event, and after taking them to a private bedroom, would drug and rob them, tossing the valuables out the window to an accomplice. She would then re-join the party for a time before making her escape.\nHer exploits were the stuff of legend, and being known to attend parties that she \"worked\" at was a status symbol in Thentian high society.\nThentians who traveled abroad would signal their origin to each other with a secret sign in her honor — flipping a coin down onto a table using two fingers of the left hand."
