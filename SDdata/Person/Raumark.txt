Raumark was an Archwizard of Hlondath, who led the southern migration that founded Halruaa.
The mans appearance was only known to Elminster Aumar, and even then, through spell-shared memories not his own.
He could cast a spell that created a whorl of disintegrating energy.
Raumark had grown dissatisfied with the attitude of his fellow arcanists in Netheril, and planned on an exodus even before the Fall.
In the , shortly after the Fall of Netheril, Raumark was involved in the founding of Hlondath, where he hoped to make a stand against the phaerimm.
Rather than stay, however, he led a great flight of skyships, including not only fellow arcanists but also their households, and so a majority of Low Netherese, south to a secluded, broad valley that would later become Halruaa. Deliberately trying to reduce the influence of fallen Netheril, he learned the language of the locals, rather than speak Netherese. He also prepared his people for a fight with the pursuing phaerimm he expected.
In a vision granted to him by Mystra in , Elminster learned that Raumark had been in a hall of white pillars, where he cast and then jumped into a spell-created whorl of disintegration.
The library of Raumark was named after him.
