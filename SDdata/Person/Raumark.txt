'''Raumark''' was an Archwizard of [[Hlondath]], who led the southern migration that founded [[Halruaa]].

==Description==
The man's appearance was only known to [[Elminster Aumar]], and even then, through spell-shared memories not his own.

==Abilities==
He could cast a [[spell]] that created a whorl of disintegrating energy.

==History==
Raumark had grown dissatisfied with the attitude of his fellow arcanists in [[Netheril]], and planned on an exodus even before the Fall.

In the {{yearlinkName|-339}},{{cite book/Shining South|132}} shortly after the [[Fall of Netheril]], Raumark was involved in the founding of [[Hlondath]], where he hoped to make a stand against the [[phaerimm]].

Rather than stay, however, he led a great flight of [[skyship]]s, including not only fellow arcanists but also their households, and so a majority of Low Netherese, south to a secluded, broad valley that would later become [[Halruaa]]. Deliberately trying to reduce the influence of fallen Netheril, he learned the language of the locals, rather than speak Netherese.{{cite web/theedverse/2021-02-14 - Halruaan Netherese Lore}} He also prepared his people for a fight with the pursuing phaerimm he expected.

In a vision granted to him by [[Mystra]] in {{yearlinkName|767}}, Elminster learned that Raumark had been in a hall of white pillars, where he cast and then jumped into a spell-created whorl of disintegration.

==Legacy==
The [[library of Raumark]] was named after him.
