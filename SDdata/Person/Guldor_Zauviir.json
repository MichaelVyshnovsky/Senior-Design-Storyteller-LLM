        "mainbody": "Guldor Zauviir was the head of the College of Mages, the College that gathered all non-specialized wizards, and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the year 1372 DR.\nGuldor had strong ties with the local church of Lolth, headed by a female of House Zauvirr.\nIn 1379 DR, in opposition to the proposal to elevate Qarlynd Melarn, Master of the Ancient Arcana, as a new member of the Conclave, Guldor proposed Tlar Mizzrynturl, Master of Baeqeshel Magic, instead. However, after Qarlynd Melarns revelation that only Lolths worshipers could practice Baeqeshel, his proposal was rejected.\nLater, he discussed with Tlar and his aunt StreeaValsharess Zauviir, the citys high priestess of Lolth, about why their plot had failed. Under orders of the Lady Penitent, Tlar killed Guldor."
