Zurk the Looney, formerly known as Zircon Gemfacet was a crazed Sembite human fighter who was part of the Ruby Blades adventuring company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Zurk was erratic, foolhardy, and suicidally brave. He was occasionally perfectly lucid and sane, but the majority of the time he was simply insane. He was fond of chatting with his stuffed hedgehog.
Zurks mental faculties were very limited, but he developed near-superhuman strength, toughness and dexterity.
He wore only plain leather armor, and carried a club in battle.
Zurk was formerly Zircon Gemfacet, a gem-dealer who had a part-time interest in adventuring. He fell afoul of a scarab of insanity, and was rendered permanently insane. Unable to continue in his old life, he became a full-time adventurer. He was eventually hired into the Ruby Blades when they ran short of muscle, and they used him to great effect in melee combat, flushing out hidden enemies, and triggering traps.
In the , the Ruby Blades joined the Wolfmasters company on an excursion to explore and loot Orvaskyte Keep in the Vast Swamp. The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby black dragon, only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of Cormyrean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep.
