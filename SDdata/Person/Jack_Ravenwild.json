        "mainbody": "'''Jack Ravenwild''' was an [[adventurer]] and thief of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was most noted for recovering the [[shadow magic]] [[spellbook]] known as the [[Sarkonagael]] from [[Sarbreen]], his defeat of [[Myrkyssa Jelan]], and for his one-hundred year imprisonment in the [[mythal]] below Ravens Bluff.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle}}",
        "Description": "Jack was a small man, with a wiry build and a round, friendly face that was perpetually split by a jester's mocking smile. Dark eyes glittered gleefully over an impish nose, a wide mouth, and a thin trace of beard along his jawline.<ref>",
        "Abilities": "Jack was a mediocre swordsman{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|1049}} and was a wielder of [[wildfire]] magic, a rare and erratic phenomenon,<ref> but enough that he had a reputation as a [[sorcerer]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4960|13}}",
        "Relationships": "His acquaintances included [[Anders Aricssen]], [[Tharzon Brewhammer]], [[Ontrodes|Ontrodes the Sage]], [[Zandria]], and [[Illyth Fleetwood]]. \n\nJack and [[Seila Norwood]] were romantically attracted and Seila's father [[Marden Norwood]] seemed to have a grudging respect for Jack.",
        "History": {
            "14{{th}} century DR": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Jack broke into [[House Kuldath]] and retrieved the Sarkonagael for the mysterious [[Myrkyssa Jelan|Elana]], and followed a [[Red Wizards|Red Wizard of Thay]] to a previously undiscovered Guilder's vault in Sarbreen.\n\nLater, Jack foiled a plot by Myrkyssa Jelan to use the ancient [[drow]] mythal in the [[Underdark]] under Ravens Bluff to end the anti-magic curse that afflicted her.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|137}} Unfortunately for Jack, the [[House of High Magic]], a local [[mage]] guild, [[divination|divined]] that Jack's wild magic would bring some sort of magical calamity (possibly the [[Spellplague]]) to Ravens Bluff so they imprisoned Jack in magical stasis inside the mythal stone.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3122|9}}",
            "15{{th}} century DR": "In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, a clan of drow were attempting to reactivate the wild mythal when they inadvertently freed Jack from his imprisonment in the stone.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|282|1}} The drow immediately put Jack to work as a slave in the [[rothe]] pens, an arrangement Jack didn't care for. During his enslavement, Jack met a young noblewoman named Seila Norwood and Jack used his magical talents to escape with Seila to Ravens Bluff.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||2}}\n\nWhen Jack returned Seila to her father, Marden Norwood, Jack was richly rewarded with a 5,000 [[gold piece]] line of credit at the local counting house as well as the use of a stately Ravens Bluff mansion for several months. To gain the respect of Lord Norwood, Jack posed as a minor noble from the [[Vilhon Reach]], the Landsgrave '''Jaer Kell Wildhame'''. Since the Vilhon Reach had been conveniently ravished by the Spellplague, it was difficult for anyone to verify his claim.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||5}}\n\nAfter settling into his new lifestyle, Jack learned that someone was offering a large reward for the Sarkonagael. Although he was surprised to learn the tome still existed in 1479 DR, he decided to find the book and claim the reward. Since Jack had possessed the book at one time, he was able to use the talents of a local [[gnome]] diviner named [[Aderbleen Krestner]] to determine the location of the book in Sarbreen.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|2046|6}}\n\nJack enlisted the help of the [[Blue Wyverns]], a local adventuring group, to recover the Sarkonagael from Sarbreen.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|2833|8}} A few days later, Jack was tracked down by a mage from [[Iriaebor]] named [[Tarandor Delhamme]]. Tarandor had been the apprentice of the apprentice of the archmage who originally imprisoned Jack in the mythal and was under standing orders to return Jack to his imprisonment should he ever escape. Tarandor lured Jack to an ambush where Jack was shrunk and placed in a bottle for transport back to the Underdark. However, Jack was able to use a [[shadow walk]] spell from the Sarkonagael to escape his confinement.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3212|9}}\n\nAfter his escape, Jack cut the spell of ''[[Sarkon's umbral simulacrum]]'' from the Sarkonagael and returned the tome for his reward.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||10}} He used the spell to create a shadow [[simulacrum]] of himself, which he delivered to Tarandor in exchange for 2,000 gp.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3958|11}} Later, Jack tricked the slaver [[Cailek Balathorp|Fetterfist]] into meeting him at a warehouse, where Jack and the Blue Wyverns ambushed and captured him.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle||11}}\n\nUnfortunately, the city watch didn't believe Fetterfist was a slaver and they released him. Jack learned from a notebook taken from Fetterfist that he intended to attack a noble revel and deliver as many people to the drow as possible.  Jack rushed to the party and, with the help of the Blue Wyverns and Myrkyssa Jelan, was able to drive the drow back through a portal to the Underdark.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4263|13}}\n\nJack jumped through the portal but was immediately captured by the drow.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4357|12}} Lord Norwood and Myrkyssa Jelan led a large company into the Underdark and rescued Jack and the captured nobles. The drow attempted to reactivate the mythal but Jack used his wild magic to destroy the device. The destruction of the mythal took away all of Jack's wild magic."
