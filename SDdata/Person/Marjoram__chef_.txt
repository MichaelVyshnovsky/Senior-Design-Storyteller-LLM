==Description==
Chef Marjoram was a commanding and demanding professional. He was a middle-aged [[human]] man. He had dark skin, hazel eyes, and black facial hair.

==History==
Marjoram learned his trade from the best â€“ Chef [[Dinethaar Marsh]], while working in the kitchens of Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]].

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Chamberlain Mercer, the man in charge of Lady [[Firelia Jannath]]'s servants, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders. Mercer placed [[Furbleston]], [[Bailey]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Jooli]], [[Phubbs]], and Chef Marjoram on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.

During his time in Lady Jannath's estate, Marjoram ran his kitchen with an iron fist, demanding perfection from his [[hin]] sous-chef [[Falura]] and Hargin Jooli, an unsavory [[dwarf|dwarvish]] prep cook.
