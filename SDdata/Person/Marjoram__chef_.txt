Chef Marjoram was one of the employees of Lady Jannaths Estate in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Chef Marjoram was a commanding and demanding professional. He was a middle-aged human man. He had dark skin, hazel eyes, and black facial hair.
Marjoram learned his trade from the best – Chef Dinethaar Marsh, while working in the kitchens of Duke Ulder Ravengard.
Circa the , Chamberlain Mercer, the man in charge of Lady Firelia Jannaths servants, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistresss orders. Mercer placed Furbleston, Bailey, Cyrilla, Jooli, Phubbs, and Chef Marjoram on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.
During his time in Lady Jannaths estate, Marjoram ran his kitchen with an iron fist, demanding perfection from his hin sous-chef Falura and Hargin Jooli, an unsavory dwarvish prep cook.
