'''Netocris bin Shalah''' was a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] ambassador to the necropolis of [[Ysawis]] for the population of [[yuan-ti]] inhabiting the [[Grey Jungle]] in [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Appearance==
As a pureblood, Netocris appeared as an attractive [[human]] woman. She wore daringly revealing silk clothing to further enhance her sexuality. Her sharp fangs were only bared when she was angered.

==Personality==
Netocris exhibited grace and manners in her dealings with the living inhabitants of Ysawis. These outward traits masked her wicked intelligence.

==Activities==
Netocris maintained the illusion that she was a bored noblewoman from [[Kadarastro]] in front of the rulers of Ysawis, hoping to establish an embassy in the city. The reality of the situation was that Netocris was there to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the [[necromancer]]s ruling the city.

She was accompanied by a quartet of [[yuan-ti halfblood]] bodyguards at all times.

==Possessions==
She owned a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a magical [[short sword]], and a ''[[philter of glibness]]''.
