'''Grimham''' was a [[svirfneblin]] who was captured by the [[Khoroshen]] tribe of [[lizardfolk]] and prevented from returning to the [[Underdark]]. He was tasked with preparing the Khoroshen's food, and took the prisoner [[Chaver Tegarech]] to the nearby [[Baeniff Tor]] on his raft. Grimham possessed a magically enhanced [[kukri]].{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|22-23}}
