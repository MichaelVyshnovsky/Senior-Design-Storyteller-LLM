        "mainbody": "Karl, commonly known as Dumb Karl, was a dwarf farmer in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.\nKarl was a homely individual but despite his appearance and nickname he was actually quite bright.\nKarl was a hill dwarf farmer who produced a lot of the grain delivered to Hillsfar.\nCirca 1486 DR, his business declined because the Merchants Guild of Hillsfar started to boycott non-human farmers. Worse still, some Red Plumes decided to make money kidnapping farmers around the city and selling them to duergar slavers.\nIn response, Karl joined a bandit group in order to attack a caravan protected by corrupt Red Plumes led by Reginald."
