        "mainbody": "'''Roderik''' was a member of the [[Night Parade]] who died while fighting a group of [[Harpers]] in [[Calimport]].",
        "Description": "Roderik appeared as a dark, featureless [[human]] whose skin seemed to absorb light and reflect shadows.",
        "Abilities": "He could walk through shadows. Additionally, what he touched would become coated in tar-like darkness that killed whoever touched it. As a member of the Inextinguishables, he was difficult to kill by normal means.",
        "Activities": "Roderik was a member of the Night Parade, in particular a member of Lord [[Zeal]]'s elite Inextinguishables force.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|1359}}, Roderik and his fellow Inextinguishables were active in Calimport, where they attacked the Harper [[Myrmeen Lhal]] and her companions. The fight went poorly, and ended when Lord Zeal killed the Inextinguishables for their failure."
