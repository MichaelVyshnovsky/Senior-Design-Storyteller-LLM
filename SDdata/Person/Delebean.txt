Delebean was a rock gnome living in Gnomengarde in the late 15 century DR.
Not unlike most of Gnomengardes inhabitants, Delebean was harmless but willing to fight to defend himself and his home.
Like all the other gnomes in Gnomengarde, Delebean had some training as a wizard in addition to his innate magical abilities.
