        "mainbody": "'''Variance Amatick''' was a [[shade]] [[cleric]] of [[Shar]] at the [[Fane of Shar]] in [[Thultanthar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She had gray black skin and black hair. She wore a black mantle over black clothing embroidered in dark purple.",
        "Equipment": "Variance used a [[chakram]] in battle.",
        "History": "In the month of [[Kythorn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Variance Amatick received a vision from Shar, commanding her to retrieve ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]'' for the [[Shadovar]]. Meanwhile, in the city of [[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]], a series of artifacts were discovered in a deep tunnel under that city's quarries. These were delivered to the [[wizard]] and archeologist [[Strasus Thingoleir]], who believed them to be of [[Netherese]] origin. Among the treasures was a pair of slate tiles that were ''The Leaves of One Night''.\n\nOn the [[Eleasis 20|20{{th}} of Eleasias]] of the same year, the Shadovar were able to recover the work. Variance Amatick had successfully tricked and manipulated [[Keph Thingoleir]], Strasus's son, by threatening to kill his friend if he did not steal ''The Leaves'' from his father's study. This he did, while a Sharran cult led by Variance attacked the temple of [[Selûne]] in the city, drawing Strasus and the rest of his wizard family to its aid.\n\nWhile Keph tried to return the tiles to Variance, the [[shadow mastiff]] that she sent to retrieve them from him charged at him, and the magic of the tiles allowed him to somehow banish the summoned monster, but the magic left one of the silver letters inscribed on his thumb from where it had touched one of the tiles. The letter had transferred itself onto his skin and was forevermore missing from the text of ''The Leaves''. From that day onward, he had the power to banish creatures of shadow.\n\nKeph reached Variance as she was battling with [[Feena Archwood]], a [[werewolf]] priestess of Selûne. Variance abandoned the fight but was able to swipe the slate tiles from Keph's hands, vanishing into the shadows.\n\nVariance returned to [[Rivalen Tanthul]] and showed him ''The Leaves of One Night'', but neither of them could interpret either the silver letters or its magical, dark whisperings.\n\nOn [[Uktar 29]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, during the [[Sembian Civil War]], Variance led a contingent of Sharran priests to help in the [[Battle of Selgaunt]] on the orders of Prince [[Rivalen Tanthul]]. On [[Uktar 30]] during the battle Rivalen ordered Variance and her clerics to destroy seven summoned [[earth elemental]]s marching upon the city and protect [[Thamalon Uskevren II]]. \n\nBy [[Nightal 8]], Variance was leader of the temple to Shar in [[Selgaunt]]."
