        "mainbody": "'''Stumpet Rakingclaw''' was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] from [[Mithral Hall]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She was a fiery dwarf with a short red beard.",
        "Personality": "Stumpet was an excellent brewer of dwarven [[wikipedia:mead|mead]] [[holy water]] and Bruenor awarded her a nine out of ten for her brewing skills.",
        "History": "She was born in [[Citadel Adbar]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Stumpet auditioned before [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to replace the fallen [[Cobble]] as Holy Cleric of the Hall. During the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Harkle Harpell]] became separated from his eyes and Stumpet was given the duty of guarding his eyes until he could reach Mithral Hall. During the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]], Stumpet rallied five hundred dwarves to open the door of Mithral Hall and charge the [[drow]] horde lead by [[Berg'inyon Baenre]].\n\nIn [[1364 DR]], Stumpet accompanied Bruenor back to [[Icewind Dale]], during which she climbed [[Kelvin's Cairn]] and unknowingly came into possession of [[Crenshinibon]]. While the artifact was unable to direct influence her without drawing her suspicions, it was able to direct her into the waiting clutches of the [[balor]] [[Errtu]], who had longer desired the Crystal Shard. Stumpet's life was spare at Crenshinibon's urging, reasoning that she was likely of Clan Battlehammer, of whom [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was associated with, so the balor imprisoned her soul in an entrapping gemstone to control her body. Stumpet was then sent back to the mines and used to lure the [[Companions of the Hall]] to the rebuilt Cryshal-Tirith, only taking period breaks throughout the journey. When Errtu later decided to take to the field, he left his gemstone behind for Crenshinibon to use and thus avoid restoring Stumpet's soul to her body. Stumpet was nearly used to drown [[Catti-brie]] before Crenshinibon to be distracted by the intrusion of [[Regis]]. After the [[halfling]] contained the shard, he retrieved Stumpet's soul prison in his escape from the collapsing tower and helped restore the cleric to her body.<ref>[[Passage to Dawn]]\n\nShe treated King Bruenor Battlehammer when he was in a coma subsequent to [[battle of Shallows]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.<ref>"
