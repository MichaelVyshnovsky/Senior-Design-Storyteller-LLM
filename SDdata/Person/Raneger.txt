'''Raneger''' was a [[watersoul genasi|watersoul]] [[genasi]] crime lord whose base of operations was the [[Den of Games]] in [[Airspur]]. He was widely considered to be the most powerful criminal in the city.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|1234}} He was grossly obese and spent most of his time soaking his bulk in a pool.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|1254}}

In [[1479 DR]], Raneger allowed a [[drow]] named [[Chenraya Xorlarrin|Chenraya]] to store illicit items in his warehouse although he wasn't aware of their true nature nor the drow's plot. When confronted by the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Demascus]] he agreed to aid in tracking down the drow.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|1347}}
