Zabbas Thuul was a rogue and all-around neer-do-well who operated out of Waterdeep and Skullport.
He made his living either as a thief, using his magical powers to augment his chances of success, or as an agent for several devious organizations who operated out of the Port of Shadows. Among those he worked for were the Iron Ring slavers and the Red Wizards of Thay through Consul Orgin Ulmokina in their enclave in Skullport.
Thuul could usually be found in one of the rooms he continuously rented at the Blushing Nymph festhall in Waterdeep, or the Burning Troll if conducting business in Skullport.
Zabbas owned a slick mithral vest, which always seemed covered in grease, allowing him to escape more easily through tight spaces.
