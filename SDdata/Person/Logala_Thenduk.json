        "mainbody": "'''Logala Thenduk''' was a female [[drow]] [[wererat]] [[rogue]] and a member of the [[Hidden]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].",
        "Description": "Although a drow, Logala spent much of her time in her [[dire rat]] form to avoid detection.",
        "Personality": "Inquisitive and sneaky, much like a rat, Logala was always hungry for information.",
        "Abilities": "As both a drow and a wererat, Logala's innate aptitude for stealth was particularly impressive. This was further enhanced thanks to her ability to transform into a dire rat and move unnoticed around the [[Underdark]].\n\nIn combat, Logala relied on attacking an opponent from the shadows and darting away again to deadly effect.<ref name =\"CotSQ-p147\"/>",
        "Possessions": "Logala traveled lightly as she depended on the natural abilities of her wererat forms most of the time. However, she was equipped with a fine [[light crossbow]], 20 [[bolt]]s, and a [[rapier]] at least.",
        "Relationships": "As a member of the Hidden, Logala worked closely with its other members to try and restore [[Maerimydra]]. She also had a large number of [[rat]] allies to assist her.",
        "History": "During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], the drow city Maerimydra fell to the armies of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] and the [[undead]] minions of [[Irae T'sarran]]. Logala Thenduk was one of a number of lurking drow and other \"invisibles\" who had evaded detection since Maerimydra's conquest. She was recruited by [[Hamadh|Hamadh the Unseen]] and united with others in common purpose against the occupying armies. With the newly formed [[Hidden]], Logala helped to restore Maerimydra to its former glory and driving out the respective forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn and Irae T'sarran.\n\nLogala was often sent on scouting mission with [[Wisp]] and [[Guk]] to spy on the forces in Maerimydra and keep an eye out for potential allies. She and Guk would provide support while the more personable Wisp approached likely candidates."
