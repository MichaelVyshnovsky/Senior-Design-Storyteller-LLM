        "mainbody": "alaghard Obarskyr III was the king of Cormyr from 897 DR to 953 DR and fought against the invading Witchlords of Wyvernwater.\nBorn in 873 DR, Galaghard was the first son of Bryntarth I.\nHe became king in 897 DR.\nIn 900 DR, on the eve of Galaghards battle with the Witch Lords, the elven court of Othorion Keove (the last survivor of the court of the Lord of the Scepters) arrived and both sides in the conflict attended, separately. Othorion refused to help either side, stating that the purpose of his visit was hunting. Galaghard led his army into the battle and was facing defeat until Othorions elves entered the battle. Othorion justified this move by saying that he felt like hunting orcs and goblins.\nGalaghard was married, and had three children Rhiigard, Tanalar, and Kathla.\nHe was named after his great grandfather, Galaghard I, and his great-great grandfather, Galaghard II, who, strangely enough was in fact the same person and also his grandfather Draxius.\nIn battle, Galaghard wore full plate mail armor with an open helm so that, despite the risk of being struck by an arrow, his troops could identify him. He rode a black armored war-horse with a headpiece featuring a unicorns horn.\nIt was said that a particular chess set in the royal palace had a good likeness of Galaghard as the white moonstone king piece. It was inspired by his battle with the Witch Lords."
