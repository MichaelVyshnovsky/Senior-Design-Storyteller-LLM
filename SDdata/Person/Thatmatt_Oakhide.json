        "mainbody": "Thatmatt Oakhide, husband of Bruha Oakhide, was a commoner inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nThatmatt was a shield dwarf with a light skin tone, brown eyes, massive bulbous nose, long brown hair and a lush long brown beard. \nIn the , during the Absolute crisis, Thatmatt and Bruha faced the dangers of increased crime levels and looming war. Thatmatt was mugged twice in one month despite him always carrying a blade and the Flaming Fist outpost in the Basilisk Gate did not bother to act on the couples reports. Like so many commoners of the Gate, Bruha and Thatmatt were unable to leave the city because they were too poor, and were too scared to stay."
