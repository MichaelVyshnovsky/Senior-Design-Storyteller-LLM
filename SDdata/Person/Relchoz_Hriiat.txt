'''Relchoz Hriiat''' was a baker in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], owner and operator of [[Hriiat Fine Pastries]], as well as the public contact for the city's [[Baker's Guild]].<ref group="note" name="owner">The book ''Adventurer's Guide to the City'' in the ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)|City of Splendors]]'' boxed-set states that the Hriiat Fine Pastries is run by "the master of the Bakers' Guild". This would make the owner [[Dundold Buldharroaz]]. However, other sources, including the two other books included within that box-set, clearly state that the owner is Relchoz Hriiat.

==Description==
Relchoz was a rather short and portly [[human]] male.

==Personality==
Relchoz had a jolly demeanor to him, but a gluttonous streak, often sampling his own wears.

==Activities==
In addition to sampling his own wears, the jolly baker often offered sample bites of his pastries to customers. Beyond the realm of bakery, however, the popularity of Hriiat Fine Pastries endowed Relchoz with such an extent of wealth that he was able to be an investor in about a fifth of all business concerns in Waterdeep that weren't exclusive to one of [[Guilds of Waterdeep|the city's guilds]]. This widespread investing went unbeknownst to most Waterdhavians.
