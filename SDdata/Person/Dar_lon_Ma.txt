'''Dar'lon Ma''' ({{Pronounce|DAR|lon|MA|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|23}}}}) was an influential member of the [[Red Wizards]] and the [[zulkir]] of [[enchantment]] in [[Thay]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|21}}

==Description==
He had a broad build and an especially charming smile.

==Personality==
Dar'lon Ma was a politically-minded man that wielded charisma and intimidation in equal measure in his dealings. His natural allure was only enhanced by his command over magic from the [[schools of magic|school]] of enchantment.

Like other ambitious Red Wizards, Dar'lon Ma sought the accumulation of power with the ultimate aim of ruling all of Thay. He did not believe other nations should be considered "allies" of Thay, but merely other lands to be conquered.

He commanded complete and utter loyalty from his followers but was not a proponent of slavery, bucking long-standing Thayan tradition.

==Relationships==
For years, Dar'lon Ma opposed the rule of Thay's regent [[Szass Tam]], a powerful [[lich]] and the centuries-old Zulkir of [[necromancy]]. His main driving goal in life was to put an end to the necromancer's reign and destroy Tam by any means necessary.

Dar'lon often arranged for others to become indebted to him, in order to call upon their services at a later time. The [[wizard]] [[Khynree]] from [[Turmish]],{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows in the Stacks|7}}

He had a strong ally in the [[mummy lord]] [[Elchorius]], a former noble from [[Mulhorand]] and priest of [[Sebek]],{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|16}} and a loyal agent in [[Damita Uthos]], a [[Mulan]] [[half-elf|half]]-[[sun elf]] who hailed from Thay.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows in the Stacks|13}}

==History==
===Plotting Against Szass Tam===
Some time ''circa'' the late 1480s DR, Dar'lon met with a group of adventurers in [[Waterdeep]] and offered them information about the whereabouts of [[Hekaton]], the missing Storm King of [[Maelstrom]].{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|4}} Shortly thereafter, Dar'lon manipulated those adventurers and his asset Master Reader Alsbith to retrieve for him the tome ''[[The Death of the Mind]]'' from within the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] in far off [[Chult]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows in the Stacks|14}}

Later on, Dar'lon tasked his servant Damita to commit to a raid against a cache of Szass Tam's arcane holdings in [[Mulmaster]]. Unfortunately the group accompanying Damita was infiltrated by loyalists of Szass Tam and ambushed Damita and her adventurer companions. Afterwards, Dar'lon Ma was declared to be traitors,{{Cite adventurers league/To Walk the Cold Dark|20}} and forced to act in open defiance of Thay's regent. Dar'lon became the target of Szass Tam's assassins and was forced into hiding.{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|8}}

===Conflict at Xorvintroth===
Dar'lon Ma meanwhile set up an ambush for Szass Tam in the recently-excavated [[Abeir]]an ruin of [[Xorvintroth]]. He developed a ritual using ''The Death of the Mind'' that could destroy the connection that the [[undead]] Tam held with his [[phylactery]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Death of Szass Tam|5}} Dar'lon took over Szass Tams undead body, and two zulkir's each fought the other throughout the city, until the battled neared closer to a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Far Realm]]â€”a place where the rules of arcana regarding liches and their phylacteries did not exist.{{Cite adventurers league/The Death of Szass Tam|11-12}} 

Masquerading as Dar'lon Ma himself, Szass Tam drew the enchanter's adventurer allies into the Far Ream in order to stop the real Dar'lon Ma from completing the ritual to disenchant Tam's phylactery. In their final showdown, the two zulkir's fought a terrible battle in the otherworldly space, as the [[Brood]] of an ancient [[Father Llymic|elder evil]] descended upon interlopers from [[Prime Material Plane|the Prime]]. In the end Szass Tam was defeated, though it was unknown if he was destroyed outright, or otherwise cast off or bound to the Far Realm. While Dar'lon Ma's fate was equally unclear, his goal of bringing down the rule Szass Tam was finally achieved.{{Cite adventurers league/The Death of Szass Tam|17-24}}
