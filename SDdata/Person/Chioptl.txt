'''Chioptl''' was a [[tabaxi]] in [[Maztica]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, her tribe's elder, a [[jaguar lord]] follower of [[Azul]], was granted a vision by the god [[Tezca]], telling of the location of the [[Cloak of One Plume]].

In order to become the elder's bride, Chioptl led a group of warriors to [[Nexal]] with the mission to recover it.

However, in Nexal, the tabaxi were captured by the [[orc]]s of Chief [[Jeordos]]. All the warriors were killed but Chioptl escaped thanks to the intervention of orcs following Chief [[Michitl]].
