Bronor was a malaugrym impersonating a merchant in the Sword Coast North during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Bronor was using coins from old Athalantar. He owned property in Luskan.
Bronor had a slender mustache with ends oiled to points. During his meeting with Mirt, he wore black Luskanite silks shot with irregular clouds of white, small stars.
As of late , Bronor had been impersonated by a malaugrym Mirt claimed to have known that for six years. During a meeting with the moneylender, Bronors coins were insulted by Mirt after a negotiation, and he then explained that he knew of the malaugrym impersonating him. He required, in exchange for keeping his secret, that Bronor keep his kin from seeking to kill, capture, or detain himself, Asper, and Shandril Shessair.
