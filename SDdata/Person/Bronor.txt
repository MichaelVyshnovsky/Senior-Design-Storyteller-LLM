'''Bronor''' was a [[malaugrym]] impersonating a merchant in the [[Sword Coast North]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Bronor was using coins from old [[Athalantar]]. He owned property in [[Luskan]].

==Description==
Bronor had a slender mustache with ends oiled to points. During his meeting with [[Mirt]], he wore black Luskanite [[silk]]s shot with irregular clouds of white, small stars.

==History==
As of late {{yearlink|1357}}, Bronor had been impersonated by a malaugrym; Mirt claimed to have known that for six years. During a meeting with the moneylender, Bronor's coins were insulted by Mirt after a negotiation, and he then explained that he knew of the malaugrym impersonating him. He required, in exchange for keeping his secret, that Bronor keep his kin from seeking to kill, capture, or detain himself, [[Asper]], and [[Shandril Shessair]].
