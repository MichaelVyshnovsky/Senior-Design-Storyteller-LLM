He was lovingly nicknamed \"Sneak Thief\" by his adoptive mother for the kids tendency to sneak around, borrow things, and listen in on adults conversations.

They were among the first people taken by the Cult of the Absolute. Harpers tried to investigate the disappearance but returned empty-handed, presuming that they were not infected with illithid tadpoles, deemed \"unworthy,\" and killed or sent to serve the cult in some other manner. All lone, Tate was sent to the High Harper of Baldurs Gate, who had a long history of raising orphans in her Lower City home.\nDuring his stay with Jaheira, Tate liked hiding away in the High Harpers library and office, where he cracked her secret door that was opened by inserting a harper pin into a hidden slot. Tate often came to \"keeping the pin safe\" and playing in Jaheiras underground sanctuary that was off-limits to everyone but the High Harper herself and her animal messengers."
