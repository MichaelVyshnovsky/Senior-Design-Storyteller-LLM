        "mainbody": "'''Shimmerteeth''' was an [[ice mephit]] residing in [[Shimmersky Valley]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Shimmerteeth was one of the larger of the many ice mephits that were drawn to protect Shimmersky Valley because of the icy region's pure and elemental cold.",
        "History": "When the [[Frosthunger Horde]] invade the Shimmersky Valley in the late 15{{th}} century DR, they clashed with the local guardians, including Shimmerteeth and its fellow ice mephits. Eventually, [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] arrived to investigate the activies of the Horde, and also clashed with the Valley's [[elemental]] guardians. Shimmerteeth was defeated by this party, and shattered into a burst of icy shards that bit through their armor."
