'''Dralkin''' was a swordcaptain with the Watch of [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the assassination of [[Seszgar Huntcrown]] by two [[blueflame ghost]]s, Dralkin called for Swordcaptain [[Tannath]], who arrived in the aftermath of the slaying. He informed Tannath of what they'd been able to determine in the meantime.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|288|27}} He had some difficulties keeping two onlookers, the dancer [[Amarune Whitewave]], and the nobleman [[Arclath Delcastle]], from peeping at the body.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|290-292|28}}

Swordcaptain Dralkin later reported to [[Glathra Barcantle]] that three noblemen had been looking frantically for a "largish [[hand axe]]".{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|331|32}} They finally were able to pursue those noblemen, [[Delasko Sornstern]], [[Broryn Windstag]], and [[Kathkote Dawntard]], until the wayward heirs were magically transported out of reach.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|336-337|32}}
