Blackfingers Ralingor perished and only seven of the Sharkers survived.\n\nThe Sharkers later revealed that Blackfingers Ralingor had in fact died at some point and afterward, at the suggestion of crewman [[Belgin Dree]], Blackfingers Ralingor became an alias: all the Sharkers were Blackfingers, and he was them."
