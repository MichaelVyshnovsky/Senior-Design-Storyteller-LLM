        "mainbody": "'''Nurih yr Catahra al Suhal''' was a moneylender in the service of the [[Rundeen]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Nurih was married to [[Fahid al Suhal|Fahid yn Nur al Suhal]], a cowardly moneylender. Fahid inherited the business from his brother but the former lacked business sense. On the contrary, Nurih was very gifted at this job, and soon she was in charge of all save the name. In [[1364 DR]], profiting in the central mercantile hub of [[Teshburl]], Nurih joined the Rundeen. She often acted for them to exchange large sums of foreign moneys into [[Calimshan]]'s currencies, which was considered less dangerous there in Teshburl than in [[Calimport]]. Her younger sister [[Melek]] was also married to [[Roffas Calindor]], a [[Tethyrian]] [[Knights of the Shield|Knight of the Shield]]."
