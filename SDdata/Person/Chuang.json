        "Activities": "Among his duties at the palace were to grand admittance to individuals who sought an audience with the Prince or Princess. Unbeknownst to them, Chaung accepted was accepting bribes from the royal couple's petitioners.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Chaung's practice of bribery was exposed by the [[dwarven]] liaison [[Abazm]], before the court of Wei Dao. While he made a brief plea for mercy, Chuang knew he could not ask forgiveness of his mistress. Princess Wei Dao offered neither and directed General [[Fui D'hang]] to immediately carry out his execution by beheading."
