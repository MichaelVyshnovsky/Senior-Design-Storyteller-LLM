        "mainbody": "Anderian Dusk was a shopkeeper in Skullport and owner of Lanternlighters.\nAround 1370 DR, Anderian had a very good understanding that a thing that people sure needed in Skullport were lights. So he sold lights of all kinds in his shop.\nHe was still in operation during the early 1490s DR but he was a broken man that spied his customers under orders of the sea hags of Sargauth River."
