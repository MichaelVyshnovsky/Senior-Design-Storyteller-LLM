        "mainbody": "'''Bharash''' was a [[dragonborn]] general who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Bharash was the leader of a company of dragonborn warriors that opposed the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and [[chromatic dragon]]s in general.",
        "Relationships": "He was an ally of [[Sabine]], the general in charge of [[Dagult Neverember]]'s army in the city.",
        "History": "When the company's [[priest]]s divined that a cell of the Cult of the Dragon was working on Neverwinter to free [[Tiamat]] from the [[Nine Hells]], Bharash and his warriors went to the city to offer their services to Lord Neverember, in order to foil the plans of the cultists. Although he was unsure at first that his offer would be accepted, Neverember gladly accepted his aid.\n\nBharash remained in Neverwinter afterwards, considering that helping the Neverwintans to protect their city was a worthy mission."
