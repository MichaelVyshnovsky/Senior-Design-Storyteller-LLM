        "mainbody": "oren was a rogue adventurer and part of Athans band that was sent to Myth Drannor by Elminster Aumar in 1369 DR.\nWhen the pool of radiance reawakened under Phlan in 1369 DR, Elminster was able to pinpoint its corrupting influence emanating from the ruins of Myth Drannor. Not losing any precious time, Elminster gathered an adventuring party, led by Athan, and armed them with the Gauntlets of Moander. The band spent some time within the ruins, investigating the mysterious magic that spawned the accursed pool, only to be ambushed by the forces of the Cult of the Dragon. Led by Pelendralaar, the cultists slaughtered most of the expedition.\nLoren died as his life and energy were magically drained away, as later deduced by Ghleanna Stormlake who inspected the body."
