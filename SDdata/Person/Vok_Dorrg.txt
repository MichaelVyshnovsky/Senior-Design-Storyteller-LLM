'''Vok Dorrg''' was the vindictive reigning king of [[Ruathym]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Activities==
Vok ruled from the [[Hall of Black Waves]]. He was too old and blind to lead his troops but he was supported by his many sons, daughters and grandchildren to captain his ship.
