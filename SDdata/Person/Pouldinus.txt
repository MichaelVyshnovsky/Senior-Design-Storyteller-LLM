Pouldinus was an archmage from the ancient Netherese Empire, who lived over 3,000 years before Dale Reckoning.
Sometime around -3000 DR Pouldinus created a powerful enchanted bastard sword for his friend Kalamnin, who was a devote follower of Amaunator. The sword was named Amaunators Legacy and survived well into the late 13 century DR.
