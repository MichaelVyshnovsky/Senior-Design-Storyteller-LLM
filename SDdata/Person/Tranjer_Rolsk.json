        "mainbody": "Tranjer Rolsk was the ruler of Aurilssbarg in the midâ€“14 century DR, and was highly loyal to Luskan.\nTranjer had thick light brown hair and a beard. He wore plate mail armor that had a blue tint, and a black and green cloak. Rolsk also owned a longsword with a shining blue crossguard.\nIn 1358 DR, Rolsk wished to capture the Heroes of Ascore and turn them over to Luskan for a huge reward. He ordered his guards to search for the heroes and tried to persuade them to redirect the group to his headquarters. However, the Heroes of Ascore managed to escape Rolsks grasp. Even if Rolsk had captured the group, the ice hunters had plans to break them out of jail."
