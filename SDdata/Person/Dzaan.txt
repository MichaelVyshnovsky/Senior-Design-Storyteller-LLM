'''Dzaan''' was a former [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] and later member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] of [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
As a Red Wizard of Thay, he studied the arcane art of [[illusion]] but later moved west to the [[Sword Coast North]], where he joined the Arcane Brotherhood. They accepted him with open arms, being eager to gain a Red Wizard among their ranks. Dzaan could have been a great asset to the Brotherhood. However, he went north to [[Icewind Dale]] where he was seemingly burned to death by the people of [[Easthaven]] after slaughtering an adventuring party. Despite his apparent death, Dzaan had cast the mighty ''[[simulacrum]]'' spell, and had kept a copy of himself at a lost Netherese spire within the Dale. This construct stayed with Dzaan's previous bodyguard, Krintaas, a wight that has accompanied him from Thay.

Adventurers would eventually find this Simulacrum and potencially assist it come to life and become real with a lost piece of Netherese technology.

==Personality==

==Abilities==
Dzaan was capable of casting arcane [[spell]]s.

==Possessions==
He had a ''[[scroll]] of [[fireball]]'' in a [[copper]] tube and a gray ''[[bag of tricks]]''.
