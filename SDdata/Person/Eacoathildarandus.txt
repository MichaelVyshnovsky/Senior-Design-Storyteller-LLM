'''Eacoathildarandus''' was an [[Dragon aging|ancient]] [[silver dragon]] who laired atop [[Scarsiir's Crag]] in the [[Cloud Peaks]] of [[Amn]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1216}}, the megalomaniacal [[red dragon]] [[Balagos]] sought out Eacoathildarandus, seeing him as a potential threat or competitor to his wide-ranging domain. The old silver wyrm proved no equal match, and Balagos won the day.
