        "mainbody": "Yrlakka was a githzerai zerth and member of the Shasal Khou, who dwelt in the Obstacle Course level of Undermountain in the late 15 century DR.\nAs a member of the Shasal Khou, Yrlakka sought the unification of the githyanki and the githzerai into a single gith race. He hoped that his activities in Undermountain could show both the githyanki and his disciples that a cooperation between the two groups was advantageous.\nHe treated all creatures that were not mind flayers or in league with them with cautious respect and instructed his pupils to do the same.\nYrlakka carried a wand of magic detection on his belt and hid a crystal vial with a potion of fire resistance strapped to his ankle.\nYrlakka led and mentored four other zerths Azal, Ezria, Rishindar, and Vond. While in Undermountain, they attacked mind flayers on sight but did not engage directly in the conflict between the githyanki and the mind flayers from Seadeeps. As observers, they were monitoring the conflict while standing ready to assist in case the githyanki required help.\nHis pupils considered him a father figure.\nIn the , Yrlakkas most headstrong pupil Ezria was captured by the githyanki in the Crystal Labyrinth while scouting their forces and looking for weak spots in their defenses. Yrlakkas group was ready to reward and offer assistance to anyone who could help them reunite with Ezria."
