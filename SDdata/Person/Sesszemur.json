        "mainbody": "esszemur was the halfling owner and manager of the popular luthdren (restaurant) Sesszemurs, located in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nSesszemur considered himself an epicure with refined tastes and used his trained palate to improve and perfect all dishes served in his luthdren. One of his specialties was fruit jellies made with imported, exotic ingredients. He was also a showman, creating huge edible sculptures out of roasted meats and vegetables which were served on silver platters so big it took many servers to bear them like a litter.\nSesszemurs favorite pastime was gambling and he spent most of his time in the top-floor gaming rooms of his establishment."
