        "mainbody": "ountess Sansuri was the ruler of the cloud giants sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.\nSansuri was one of the giant lords at the time of the shattering of the ordning.\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of storm giant king Hekaton, all giant lords started their path to reshaping the ordning. Sansuris plan was to rediscover one of the ancient Ostorian markets containing a long-lost trove of dragon magic.\nIn order to accomplish her project, Sansuri lured the bronze dragon Felgolos into her castle and imprisoned him in order to extract information. Though Felgolos knew nothing, Sansuri did not believe him and tortured him terribly.\nSansuri was always near Felgolos trying to extract information."
