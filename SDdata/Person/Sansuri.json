        "History": "Sansuri was one of the [[giant]] lords at the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]].\n\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, after the disappearance of [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]], all giant lords started their path to reshaping the ordning. Sansuri's plan was to rediscover one of the ancient [[Ostoria]]n markets containing a long-lost trove of [[dragon]] magic.\n\nIn order to accomplish her project, Sansuri lured the [[bronze dragon]] [[Felgolos]] into her castle and imprisoned him in order to extract information. Though Felgolos knew nothing, Sansuri did not believe him and tortured him terribly.",
        "Activities": "Sansuri was always near Felgolos trying to extract information."
