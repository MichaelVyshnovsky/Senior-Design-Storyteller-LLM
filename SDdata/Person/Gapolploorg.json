        "mainbody": "'''Gapolploorg''' was a powerful [[kuo-toa]] whip of [[Sloopdilmonpolop]] and priest of [[Blibdoolpoolp]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Gapolploorg was one of the few relatively sane members of the ruling kuo-toa elite. His focus was on the defense of the city, despite the lack of threats. In fact, after his eventual promotion, he planned to attack the [[deep gnome]]s of the [[Starspire Mountains]].",
        "History": "Gapolploorg was the commander of the [[Sea mother whip|Whips]], the order of thieves/priests of Sloopdilmonpolop. His main role was to organize the defense of the city. He answered to the aged Oorg-Poolgoop (the priest-duke of war) [[Gibupgagool]], but over time the old kuo-toa had ceded most of his authority to his enthusiastic assistant Gapolploorg. All agreed that, at the death of the priest-duke of war, Gapolploorg would likely become his successor."
