        "mainbody": "Sparkrender was a blue dragon wyrmling active in the late 15 century DR. He was remarkably loathsome and dangerous for his age, and plotted to use the lingering spirits of dead dragons on Stormwreck Isle to grant himself godlike power.\nHe was skinny for a blue wyrmling, and his scales glittered.\nHis roar sounded more like a screech, and when he spoke it sounded akin to barking and growling.\nHe was arrogant,\nSparkrender had just begun to amass a hoard in the late 15 century DR, and many of his treasures were either mundane items that had caught his eye&mdashnotably he seemed fond of candlesticks&mdashor gemstones that were blue in color, such as blue quartz and blue jasper.\nEldenemir, a great blue dragon known as the \"Raging Storm\", had been Sparkrenders grandfather and was the inspiration in his quest for power. While Runara still dwelt on Stormwreck Isle at the time of Sparkrenders plot, she had sworn off violence since killing Eldenemir, and so did little to disrupt the evil wyrmlings plans.\nSparkrender had a following of kobolds on Stormwreck Isle, recruiting the ones who disagreed with the more peaceful way of life enjoyed by their kin at Dragons Rest. While some of his minions were tasked with roving the island and attacking travelers,\nAs of the , Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle, the same site where his grandfather had attempted to harness the power of the islands fallen dragons a century prior.\nThe appointed time for the ritual was quite close by the time Sparkrender met his first major resistance&mdashin the form of an attack by a bronze dragon wyrmling named Aidron&mdashand by that time he had already been on the island for nearly a year, during which time he had amassed a following of more than a dozen kobold minions. Believing that he needed Aidron as a sacrifice to complete his ritual, he subdued the bronze wyrmling after failing to trick him into joining him. His kobold minions then set about completing the preparations for the ritual by building and painting crude sculptures of the five great dragons whom Sparkrender intended to bind the great red dragon Sharruth, the three metallic dragons who defeated Sharruth long ago&mdashAstalagan, Clyssavar, and Turadaer&mdashand his own grandfather, Eldenemir."
