'''Banak''' was the most powerful [[evil]] [[priest]] in all the [[Bloodstone Lands]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Banak was thoroughly evil, and was a cruel, obsessive, and ambitious man. He was prone to legendarily violent outbursts. His allies suspected that he had begun to lose touch with reality following the banishment of his god.

==Abilities==
His specialty was the domain of the [[undead]]. The evil priest would cast ''[[animate dead]]'' on whatever corpses he could acquire, and often used his powerful [[staff]] to create new corpses. His powers were said to be great enough that he could raise small armies all by himself.

==Possessions==
Banak possessed the ''[[staff of the adder]]''. Prior to the defeat and banishment of his god from the Bloodstone Lands, he also possessed the ''[[Amulet of Orcus]]'', which allowed him to summon armies of undead and [[fiend]]s.

==Relationships==
Banak was a leader of the [[Cult of the Goat's Head]], and one of the top three commanders in the [[Citadel of Assassins]] alongside the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] and the [[archmage]] [[Knellict]], although he frequently clashed with them over differing priorities.

He had made a sworn enemy of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], and especially of his priestly companion, Friar [[Dugald]].

==History==
Banak was an exceptionally powerful cleric that roamed the Bloodstone Lands the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

After [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party banished his demon patron, [[Orcus]], from [[Faer√ªn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Banak lost much of his power, and could only cast spells of intermediate power at most. Even so, Banak was experienced enough to remain a great threat to goodly folk of [[Vaasa]] and [[Damara]], although none knew the source of his continuing power. While his allies at the time were focused on consolidating wealth, Banak wished to raise an army and once again attempt to conquer the Bloodstone Lands, and this obsession seemed to be driving him mad.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Banak remained active in Vaasa, and worked to try and raise an army among Zhengyi's old minions. By this time, he was declaring himself to be the "son and heir" of the Witch-King.<ref group="note">Banak is not named explicitly in ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition|A Grand Tour of the Realms]]'' (1993), however the description of "a wild-eyed priest of evil who is seeking to unite the non-human tribes" most closely matches descriptions of Banak and his goals as described in ''[[The Bloodstone Lands (sourcebook)|The Bloodstone Lands]]'' (1989).
