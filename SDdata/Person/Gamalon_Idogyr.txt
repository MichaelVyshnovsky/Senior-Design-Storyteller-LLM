==History==
[[File:Gamalon ldogyr.jpg|thumb|''Gamalon Idogyr in his crimson robes.'']]
Much of Gamalon's family, including his mother and two oldest siblings, were killed in [[1313 DR]], when Gamalon was only eleven-years-old, during a series of feuds that occurred between his family and [[Clan Trecask]] from the Duchy of [[Dusk]].

Gamalon was educated at the [[Mystics' Academy]] in Erlkazar.

Sometime in his early life, Gamalon became an adventurer and explorer.

In [[1333 DR]], Gamalon left [[Toril]] and his homeland of [[Tethyr]] and lived on the [[Rock of Bral]], one of the [[Tears of Selûne]], where he maintained a curio shop. At some point while there, Gamalon discovered a secret stash of [[orbus ring]]s, which enhanced the power of [[spelljamming]] helmsmen. For a time, Gamalon was the only seller of such rings.

During his time on the Rock of Bral,  he became enamored with a merchant's daughter, named Mynda. After four years of pursuing her, she finally agreed to become his wife.

During the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Ten Black Days of Eleint|Ten Black Days of Eleint]], one of his sisters and one of his brothers and most of the members of their families were slain for being nobility.

Gamalon returned to Toril, to his grandfather's lands in County Spellshire near the [[Forest of Tethir]], sometime before the [[First Siege of Myratma]]. He provided magical support in both the First and [[Second Siege of Myratma|Second Sieges]], and for this, he was rewarded his grandfather's old lands to rule over as count.

In [[1370 DR]], Gamalon, his daughter, her husband, and [[Timoth Eyesbright]] traveled to [[Trailstone]] after that town defected from [[Amn]]. These four helped train the citizens in defending their city.

In 1374 DR, Gamalon planned to break the "Tethyr Curse" by staying in Waterdeep over the winter. He planned to give guest lectures at [[Blackstaff Tower]].

Gamalon Idogyr, Raegar, and Damlath survived, but Gamalon's wife, many guards, and other bystanders were killed in the incident. While Gamalon was laid low, Damlath (who was possessed by the [[lich]] [[Priamon "Frostrune" Rakesk]]) stole his gem eye.

Gamalon joined in Khelben's plan to stop Priamon, and the lich was defeated. At the end of the ordeal, [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] herself rewarded him by giving him a new magical left eye.

==Trivia==
Gamalon was allergic to cats, including [[tressym]].
