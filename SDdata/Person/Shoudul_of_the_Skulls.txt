==Description==
Shoudul wore an impressive feathered headdress – a symbol of status among Batiri.

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, the Shattered Spear tribe came across the shipwreck of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', a vessel that belonged to [[Sa'Sani]]'s trade company. The Batiri attacked the survivors, including the infamous author [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Some of the survivors were captured by Taelunangul's goblins, along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by [[Ghzermag]], [[Clawkeeper Kzheemoc]], and Shoudul of the Skulls. Volo tried to persuade the charming locals to let the survivors go, but he was not as proficient in the [[Goblin language]] as he claimed to be. After the deaths of several Batiri, Shoudul of the Skulls tried to communicate in broken [[Common]] that he didn't want to fight; instead, he just wanted a meal – a meal of adventurers' supple flesh. Subsequently, Shoudul of the Skulls was killed along with other bloodthirsty Batiri.
