Bahija al-Kesir was a human pragmatist within the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Bahija led a contingent of priests who operated the palace hospital. She ensured that her staff was always prepared for a tragedy. They spent most of their time healing guards who were injured during training exercises.
Bahija was also a superb midwife. She was ready to attend a wife or concubine of the Grand Caliph should they give birth.
