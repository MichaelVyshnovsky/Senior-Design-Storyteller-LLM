Bahija led a contingent of priests who operated the palace hospital. She ensured that her staff was always prepared for a tragedy. They spent most of their time healing guards who were injured during training exercises.

Bahija was also a superb midwife. She was ready to attend a wife or concubine of the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] should they give birth.
