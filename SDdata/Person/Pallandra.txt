'''Pallandra''' was a [[human]] high [[cleric|priestess]] of [[Set]] in [[Mulhorand]] in the [[Old Empires]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Pallandra had pale skin, which stood in stark contrast to her jet-black hair. She dressed in a revealing, pink dress with an exposed midriff, and adorned herself with many types of jewelry.

==Possessions==
She owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', as well as a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'' and a set of ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]''.

==History==
When her order came under attack by followers of the good-aligned deities, Pallandra turned to several sources of dark [[magic]] in a bid to preserve the order's power and temples.
