Pallandra was a human high priestess of Set in Mulhorand in the Old Empires in the mid–14 century DR.
Pallandra had pale skin, which stood in stark contrast to her jet-black hair. She dressed in a revealing, pink dress with an exposed midriff, and adorned herself with many types of jewelry.
She owned a pair of bracers of defense, as well as a ring of shooting stars and a set of slippers of spider climbing.
When her order came under attack by followers of the good-aligned deities, Pallandra turned to several sources of dark magic in a bid to preserve the orders power and temples.
