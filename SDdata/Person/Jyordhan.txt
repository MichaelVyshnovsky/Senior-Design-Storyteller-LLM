'''Jyordhan''' was a [[Zhentarim]] agent and the Lord of [[Shadowdale]] between [[1339 DR]] and his death in [[1345 DR]].

==History==
When [[Aumry]] was assassinated by Zhentarim agents in 1339 DR, Jyordhan captured and killed these assassins, claimed the ''[[Pendant of Ashaba]]'', and presented himself as the new lord, to which the people of Shadowdale agreed. Jyordhan moved the seat of power in Shadowdale from the traditional [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] to [[Castle Krag]], and the location was soon full of Zhentarim agents. A revolt by the people triggered the dispatch of peacekeeping forces from [[Zhentil Keep]], and although [[Sylun√© Silverhand]] was aware of Jyordhan's true nature, she sought to maintain order in the dale rather than try to overthrow him.

Jyordhan was killed in 1345 DR when he ambushed [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] on leaving Shadowdale, although official accounts state that Jyordhan was visiting Khelben in [[Waterdeep]] when he passed away from an illness. Jyordhan had nominated [[Lyran]] of [[Melvaunt]] as a successor to the lordship, but without the ''Pendant of Ashaba'' no claim could be made.
