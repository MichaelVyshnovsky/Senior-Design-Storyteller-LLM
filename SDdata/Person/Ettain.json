        "Activities": "Ettain was known as the \"caulker\" of the Beached Leviathan because he was in charge of the maintenance of the tavern's infrastructure. He was also one of the most skilled carpenters living in Neverwinter around [[1479 DR]].\n\nAs such, Ettain knew every inch of the Beached Leviathan and was aware of the secret room where [[Harrag]], the Beached Leviathan's owner, had stored his personal fortune. Ettain was a true friend of Harrag and he never betrayed his trust, however. Moreso, he was one of the few people who always tried to protect Harrag from [[Dagult Neverember]]'s plots.{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|60}}"
