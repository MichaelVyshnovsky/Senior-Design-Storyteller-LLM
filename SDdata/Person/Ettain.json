        "mainbody": "ttain was a regular patron of the Beached Leviathan, one of the most popular taverns of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.\nEttain was known as the \"caulker\" of the Beached Leviathan because he was in charge of the maintenance of the taverns infrastructure. He was also one of the most skilled carpenters living in Neverwinter around 1479 DR.\nAs such, Ettain knew every inch of the Beached Leviathan and was aware of the secret room where Harrag, the Beached Leviathans owner, had stored his personal fortune. Ettain was a true friend of Harrag and he never betrayed his trust, however. Moreso, he was one of the few people who always tried to protect Harrag from Dagult Neverembers plots."
