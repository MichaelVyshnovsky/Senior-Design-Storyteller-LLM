        "Activities": "Fremin operated out of an antique and curios shop in a less-than-savory part of Baldur's Gate.

        "Relationships": "[[File:Fremin's_shop.png|thumb|right|350px|''Fremin welcoming the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] to his shop.'']]\nHe was served by a group of [[tressym]]s that were well-trained to detect items and beings from the [[lower planes]]. His most trusted of the group was [[Beatrice (tressym)|Beatrice]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fremin Greer hired a group of thieves to steal an ''[[infernal puzzle box]]'' from High Overseer [[Thavius Kreeg]] in [[Elturel]] to avoid some catastrophic event of which he was not certain. Some time later, the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] recovered the ''puzzle box'' and returned it to Fremin's shop to learn more information.\n\nUnfortunately the heroes' intervention attracted the attention an [[osyluth]] along with several [[imp]]s and other lesser [[devil]]s to Fremin's shop on the [[Prime Material plane]]. He was killed in the attack, but not before arming the heroes with more information to help secure the city of [[Elturgard]]'s capital.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|14-19}}"
