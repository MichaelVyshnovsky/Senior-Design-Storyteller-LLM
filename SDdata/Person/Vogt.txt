'''Vogt''' was a member of the [[Company of Dawn]], an mercenary that operated out of [[Arabel]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Vogt and the Company of the Dawn took on the job of escorting some friends and acquaintances of their leader [[Thurbrand]] through [[Spiderhaunt Wood]]. The journey was devastating to their company, leading to many of their deaths, leaving only Vogt, Thurbrand, and [[Isaac (mercenary)|Isaac]] as survivors.

After arriving at their destination in Shadowdale, the three remaining members of the company returned to the city of [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]].
