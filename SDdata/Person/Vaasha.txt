'''Vaasha''' was a [[storm giant]] residing in the [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] in the [[Trackless Sea]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Vaasha was very careful and meticulous when hunting and tracking but could be careless when speaking with others, even her king. When it came to leadership, she valued and respected honesty above all else. 

She was very passionate about protecting the environment of her homeland, willing to lay down her life for it, though she longed for the day that she could just return to the serenity of the ocean's depths.

==History==
Vaasha was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator [[Uthor]] in the [[Hekaton|Storm King]]'s assault on [[Iymrith]]'s lair. She fought alongside [[Nimir]], [[Orlekto]], and [[Shaldoor]].
