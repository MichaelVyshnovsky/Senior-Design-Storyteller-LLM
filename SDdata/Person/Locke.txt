'''Locke''' was a [[human]] [[psionicist]] who worked as an entertainer and confidence artist.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|154|Locke's Medallion of Thought Projection}}

==Description==
He had tan skin, with long, graying hair, and clad himself in a long blue robe fastened with a black belt at his waist. He was known for being rather ugly.

==Personality==
Locke was a wanderer, only staying in any one place long enough to earn a few coins. He thoroughly enjoyed surprising people with his [[psionics|psionic]] powers. Locke had the privilege of having many friends and no enemies, a feat he accomplished by manipulating people with his ''[[medallion of thought projection]]''. He also used the ''medallion'' to acquire romantic partners, and was well known for his uncanny ability to seduce women.

==Possessions==
Locke's ''medallion of thought projection'' caused him to broadcast his thoughts to anyone within 90 feet straight in front of him. Over time, he learned to harness this power, ensuring he could control exactly who picked up his thoughts. He paid a [[wizard]] to enchant the ''medallion'' with a permanent ''[[suggestion]]'' spell, allowing him to cast the spell mentally, then project it into the mind of his choice.

Aside from his ''medallion'', Locke owned a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]''.

==Activities==
One of his regular grifts involved using his ''medallion'' to convince his marks they were psychic.
