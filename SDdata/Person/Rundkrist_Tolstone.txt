}}'''Rundkrist Tolstone''' was a retired [[gnome]] [[adventurer]] that lived in [[Secomber]] ''circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. He gained local renown for his skill at patching, painting, and plastering homes, as well as doing interior design.{{Cite dragon/270/The New Adventures of Volo: The Ardeep|93}}

==History==
Formerly a member of the [[Masters of Monsters]] adventuring band, Rundkrist retired to Secomber after many of his group were slain. One of their expeditions brought them face to face with the occupant of [[Reluraun's Tomb]] in [[Ardeep Forest]] in the [[1345 DR|Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR]]. Reportedly, they witnessed [[Reluraun]] (ineffectually) thrust a sword through a [[Baelnorn lich|baelnorn]] that was admonishing them to leave the insane [[elven]] warrior's spirit alone.

==Rumors & Legends==
He was said to have gained many riches during his adventuring days, but he was not conspicuous in his consumption nor ostentatious in his lifestyle, so, if true, he kept his wealth well hidden.
