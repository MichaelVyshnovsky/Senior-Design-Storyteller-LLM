'''Uni''' was a [[unicorn]] foal from [[the Realm]] ([[Forgotten Realms|no relation]]) and the pet of the [[barbarian]] [[Bobby]], together with his companions the [[monk]] [[Diana]], the [[fighter]] [[Eric]], the [[ranger]] [[Hank]], the [[wizard]] [[Presto]], and his elder sister, the [[rogue]] [[Sheila]].

==Description==
Uni would sometimes prove useful to her companions, but could also get into trouble.

==Abilities==
Still young for a unicorn, Uni lacked all of an adult unicorn's powers, but could still cast a small number of [[spell]]s. These included ''[[cure light wounds]]'' thrice a day and ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', and ''[[greater teleport]]'' (but only within a forest) each once a day. The unicorn an aura of ''[[magic circle against evil]]''.

==Combat==
The small unicorn attacked with her magical alicorn.

==History==
Uni lived in the Realm and met Bobby the Barbarian and his friends soon after they entered that place. The two quickly bonded and became inseparable.

===The Victims of Tiamat===
[[File:Uni, Bobby, and an adventurer.png|thumb|''Uni, [[Bobby]], and an [[adventurer]] on the streets of [[Neverwinter]].'']]
Living long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the small unicorn was rumored to be a pet of a diminutive barbarian among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], with the barbarian being swallowed by one of her heads. It was supposed that the unicorn was swallowed as well. By [[1369 DR]], the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], displayed paintings of the barbarian and the ranger.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Uni, despite being a unicorn, was known as an accomplished adventurer who traveled alongside Bobby. Fully adult, she was a strong, confident, and graceful creature who took on any challenge horn-first. Uni and Bobby were seen joining adventurers in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
