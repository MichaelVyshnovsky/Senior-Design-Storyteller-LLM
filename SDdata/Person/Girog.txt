'''Girog''' was a [[hill giant]] who lived in [[Hill giant camp of Chief Groote|Chief Groote's steading]], and was one of the highest ranking food gatherers in his community.

==History==
In [[1366 DR]],{{Giantcraft date}} at a point when he was considered elderly for his race, Girog began routinely meeting in secret with some [[rogue]]s from [[Hartsvale]]. He would purchase [[stag]] meat from them that they had poached from the royal forests of King [[Camden]].

Girog traded this illegal meat with the glutton [[Gorgg]], under the promise that he would be given the unusually tender foodstuffs he needed to win an [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] challenge and thus rise in the hill giant social strata to the class of glutton.
