'''Isla Donrig''' was a [[bard]] from the [[Moonshae Isles]] based in [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the early 1370s DR, she composed an epic titled "[[The Unicorn's Blessed Crescent]]", which covered legends of the Delimbiyr Vale, including that of [[Phantoms' Cloister]]. Few knew from whence she received her information, however.

On [[Shieldmeet]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, she undertook the ceremony of the [[Green Regent]] in Loudwater and was accepted as a [[Scion of the Green Regent]].

Soon after, in the month of [[Eleasis]], Isla went on an expedition into the [[High Forest]] to investigate rumors of a group of [[wild elves]] who worshiped a [[dragon]]. A [[tenday]] later, she had not returned.
