'''Ezzat''' was a [[lich]] who resided in [[Undermountain]]. There was no one level he called home as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but he resided in the [[Runestone Caverns]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.<ref Name="WDMM-p262"/>

==History==
Many centuries prior to the 14{{th}} century DR and before becoming a lich, Ezzat was offered the chance by [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]] to become an apprentice of his, but was convinced otherwise by a [[priest]] friend of his named [[Lliira lightened]].<ref Name="WDMM-p262" />

Later, his priest friend died of old age, which prompted Ezzat to become a lich to avoid the same fate. He later set up a tower in a stalagmite on the Runestone Caverns level of Undermountain, and later acquired a [[pseudodragon]] companion [[Ipses]]. Here he was based around [[1492 DR]].{{Waterdeep-time}}<ref Name="WDMM-p262" />

==Personality==
Ezzat dreamed of one day taking over Undermountain from Halaster Blackcloak, and fantasized about one day forming an alliance with Halaster's former companion, [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]].<ref Name="WDMM-p263">

He was skilled at the game [[Coroniir]], which he sometimes played with a ''[[staff of frost]]'' he had imbued with sentience.<ref Name="WDMM-p262" />

==Possessions==
Ezzat owned an ebony wand and a ''[[amulet of proof against detection]]'', as well as a large collection of books on [[Undermountain]], which he used to research how to overthrow Halaster.<ref Name="WDMM-p263" />
