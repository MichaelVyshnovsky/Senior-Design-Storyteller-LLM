'''Fell Hatchet''' was an operative of the [[Kraken Society]] who infiltrated [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]]. He managed to pose as the Head of Security of an entire ward.

==Description==
Hatchet was a cruel-faced man. He dressed in regal attire, had a balding forehead, and a large black beard.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]] visited [[Amelior Amanitas]] in [[Secomber]], and he handed them a letter of vital importance to give to [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]]. The heroes were tasked with escorting ambassadors of the [[Lords' Alliance]] from [[Leilon]] to [[Waterdeep]], and would present the letter on arrival. However, in the [[Rutting Buck]] tavern of Leilon, their rendezvous, the heroes were [[poison]]ed, and the letter was swapped with a forged one.

Upon entry to [[Waterdeep]], the heroes told the guards of their mission, and were escorted to the ward's Head of Security, which was actually Fell Hatchet. He read the forged letter which exposed the carriers as being spies. Accordingly, the Kraken operative ordered the convinced guards to tie up the Heroes of Ascore and toss them into the sea. Chained up, and with heavy rocks attached, the heroes descended into the depths of the [[Trackless Sea]]. However, they were rescued by [[sirine]]s, and lived to foil the plans of the Kraken Society, [[Zhentarim]] and [[Luskar]] spies.
