Malkyn Grenefeld was a chamberlain of Hillsfar in the late 15 century DR.
Malkyn was the citys chamberlain and the courts mage.
A member of the Brotherhood of the Cloak in Mulmaster, Malkyn abandoned her city and was chosen to join the First Lords court.
Circa 1486 DR, she attended the First Lords Midsummer Masquerade ball.
During the ball, Torin started a speech and an elf assassin tried to kill the First Lord but hit only Thessaly Malaeda. Malkyn quickly reached Torin and the two disappeared thanks to an invisibility spell and she took the Lord to a safe place.
Later, during the trip of the First Lord to YÃ»lash, Malkyn led a group of Red Plumes to capture Elanil Elassidil of Elventree. She discovered that the elven bard briefly stopped at the Plodding Plow, in the village of the Stop and decided to check all the customers. 
Malkyn was totally loyal to Torin Nomerthal. She was very rigid and adhered to protocol. Malkyn was a talented mage.
