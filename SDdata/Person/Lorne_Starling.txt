'''Lorne Starling''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] from [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] and an agent of [[Black Garius]] during the [[Shadow War]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
He was the older brother of [[Bevil Starling]] and the son of [[Retta Starling]].

==History==
He was once the undisputed champion of the West Harbor Harvest Brawl for three years and a good friend of [[Cormick]]. However, Cormick also wanted to become the Harvest champion. Knowing he had no chance of winning if he took on Lorne head-on, Cormick instead waited and bided his time until Lorne let his guard down and then, with a flurry of blows, knocked Lorne out. After the defeat, Lorne felt that Cormick had cheated him and became more reclusive.

After Cormick left the village and went to [[Neverwinter]] to enter the [[City Watch (Neverwinter)|City Watch]], Lorne also went to the city, joining the [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter]], seeing this as his opportunity to shine. But the war against [[Luskan]] in the {{yearlinkName|1372}} left Lorne greatly embittered for the many friends dead and the jealously of his captain.

Afterward, Lorne disappeared, and he became a member of the [[Circle of Blades]], a secret Luskan assassination squad. He was recruited by the ambassador [[Torio Claven]] and later worked directly under Black Garius. Under Garius's orders, in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Lorne served as his agent to [[Logram Eyegouger]] of the [[orc]]s at [[Old Owl Well]], after Garius had Lorne massacre the village of [[Ember]] while disguised as the [[Kalach-Cha]] in order to frame them.

The Kalach-Cha discovered the truth and invoked a trial by combat; obviously, Luskan's champion was Lorne. After being defeated, Lorne died (either killed by the Kalach-Cha or by Garius for failing) and was dismissed by the Luskan authorities as a rogue element.
