Mordulkin's activities on [[Luthcheq]]'s borders had led to a fresh round of border disputes, which could themselves lead to all-out war. The citizens of Mordulkin feared there could never be peace until Luthcheq had been demolished; mobs numbering in the hundreds marched on Hercubes's palace on a daily basis, chanting \"We want war!\"\n\nIn the [[1365 DR|Year of the Sword, 1365 DR]], the Great Bone Wyrm [[Alasklerbanbastos]] and his [[chromatic dragon]] minions swooped down from the [[Riders to the Sky Mountains]] and laid claim to all the lands of [[Threskel]] and northeastern Chessenta—including Mordulkin. The [[vampiric]] [[green dragon]] [[Jaxanaedegor]] declared himself Viceroy of Threskel and flew over Mordulkin, demanding the city pay regular tribute to the Great Bone Wyrm lest its leaders be replaced. Mordulkin's leaders actually did little about this until Jaxanaedegor returned with a flight of [[dracolich]]es and repeatedly attacked major trade caravans both entering and exiting the city. Thereafter, a humbled Mordulkin began to deliver regular tribute via caravans to [[Mount Thulbane]] to appease their new dragon overlords.\n\nAround [[1372 DR]], the citizens of Mordulkin were again clamoring for a war to annihilate hated Luthcheq.\n\nHowever, near the end of the [[Rage of Dragons]], on [[Nightal 1]], the great [[red dragon]] [[Tchazzar]] made a shocking and devastating return to Chessenta. Tchazzar drove out Alasklerbanbastos's dragon minions, and reclaimed his dominion over Chessenta. Tchazzar began working to bring the other city-states into his fold, through covert negotiations and threats; Mordulkin was likely among those discreetly negotiating its re-admittance to the empire by the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]. Nevertheless, agents of House Jedea tried to work out Tchazzar's specific plans for Mordulkin, fearing he would turn it into a military camp commanded by one of his generals. More generally, Mordulkin's leaders anxious watched and awaited Tchazzar's plans. Meanwhile, King Hercubes was holding on to power, causing some in the House to make secret deals with Jaxanaedegor—Tchazzar's rival—once more.\n\nFinally, in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], survivors of the defeated [[Mage Society]] rebels in [[Luthcheq]]—[[Ythnel Duumin]], [[Kestus Aentius]], and [[Muctos Dapritus]]—escaped to Mordulkin and Hercubes met them in secret at the [[Jedea Academy]], giving them aid and inviting to return to Luthcheq to sabotage the [[witchweed]] supplies to pave the way for an invasion.

        "Activities": "Hercubes clung to power well past his natural reign by using magic to stave off the effects of age. He'd named no heir from House Jedea, feeling that none of his kin were capable of keeping Mordulkin free of the claws of Jaxanaedegor. This triggered a struggle for succession and provoked that very same danger—some ambitious Jedea reached out to Jaxanaedegor himself, making secret pacts to gain the dragon's backing if they seized the throne.",
        "Description": "Hercubes Jedea had an imposing and handsome build, and a deep and commanding voice. He had thick gray hair that fell to his shoulders, a neatly trimmed beard and goatee, bushy eyebrows, bright eyes, and broad mouth in a square face. He wore a thick red cape and deep-purple silk robe, with a gold band bedecked with jewels for a crown."
