        "mainbody": "King Hercubes Jedea was a human wizard, a member of the Jedea family, and the ruler of the city-state of Mordulkin in Chessenta in the mid- to late 14th century DR.\nHe was the most powerful mage of the Jedea family and, as per custom, became the ruler of the city, a position he held before the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR.\nIn that year, Chessenta was once again wracked by warfare, but Mordulkin had yet to join the fray. Mordulkins activities on Luthcheqs borders had led to a fresh round of border disputes, which could themselves lead to all-out war. The citizens of Mordulkin feared there could never be peace until Luthcheq had been demolished mobs numbering in the hundreds marched on Hercubess palace on a daily basis, chanting \"We want war!\"\nIn the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR, the Great Bone Wyrm Alasklerbanbastos and his chromatic dragon minions swooped down from the Riders to the Sky Mountains and laid claim to all the lands of Threskel and northeastern Chessenta—including Mordulkin. The vampiric green dragon Jaxanaedegor declared himself Viceroy of Threskel and flew over Mordulkin, demanding the city pay regular tribute to the Great Bone Wyrm lest its leaders be replaced. Mordulkins leaders actually did little about this until Jaxanaedegor returned with a flight of dracoliches and repeatedly attacked major trade caravans both entering and exiting the city. Thereafter, a humbled Mordulkin began to deliver regular tribute via caravans to Mount Thulbane to appease their new dragon overlords.\nAround 1372 DR, the citizens of Mordulkin were again clamoring for a war to annihilate hated Luthcheq.\nHowever, near the end of the Rage of Dragons, on Nightal 1, the great red dragon Tchazzar made a shocking and devastating return to Chessenta. Tchazzar drove out Alasklerbanbastoss dragon minions, and reclaimed his dominion over Chessenta. Tchazzar began working to bring the other city-states into his fold, through covert negotiations and threats Mordulkin was likely among those discreetly negotiating its re-admittance to the empire by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR. Nevertheless, agents of House Jedea tried to work out Tchazzars specific plans for Mordulkin, fearing he would turn it into a military camp commanded by one of his generals. More generally, Mordulkins leaders anxious watched and awaited Tchazzars plans. Meanwhile, King Hercubes was holding on to power, causing some in the House to make secret deals with Jaxanaedegor—Tchazzars rival—once more.\nFinally, in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, survivors of the defeated Mage Society rebels in Luthcheq—Ythnel Duumin, Kestus Aentius, and Muctos Dapritus—escaped to Mordulkin and Hercubes met them in secret at the Jedea Academy, giving them aid and inviting to return to Luthcheq to sabotage the witchweed supplies to pave the way for an invasion. With Luthcheq in turmoil, Mordulkin started to move against Luthcheq.\nHercubes clung to power well past his natural reign by using magic to stave off the effects of age. Hed named no heir from House Jedea, feeling that none of his kin were capable of keeping Mordulkin free of the claws of Jaxanaedegor. This triggered a struggle for succession and provoked that very same danger—some ambitious Jedea reached out to Jaxanaedegor himself, making secret pacts to gain the dragons backing if they seized the throne.\nHercubes Jedea had an imposing and handsome build, and a deep and commanding voice. He had thick gray hair that fell to his shoulders, a neatly trimmed beard and goatee, bushy eyebrows, bright eyes, and broad mouth in a square face. He wore a thick red cape and deep-purple silk robe, with a gold band bedecked with jewels for a crown."
