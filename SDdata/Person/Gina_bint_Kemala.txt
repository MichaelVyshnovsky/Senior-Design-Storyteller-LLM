Gina bint Kemala was a human mystic and member of the Readers in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Her long black hair began to streak with grey as she approached middle age. Her sharp eyes and commanding voice instantly grabbed the attention of anyone with whom she spoke. Gina favored a turquoise blue aba.
Gina worshiped Zann and was the leader of the Readers in 1367.
She spent most of her time within the Mosque of Zann the Wise, but could be found lecturing people in the public gardens. Her pursuit of mathematics often led her to hire experienced adventurers to retrieve texts from dangerous locales.
Gina owned a ring of protection +3, a staff of command, a gem of seeing, and carried a variety of magical scrolls.
