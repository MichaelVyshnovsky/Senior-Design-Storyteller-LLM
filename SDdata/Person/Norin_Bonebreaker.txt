Norin Bonebreaker was a dwarven cleric and butcher, who operated with his sibling the Two Brothers Butchery in Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.
Norin wore his hair in twin braids, stood  tall, and weighed around .
He was a very light-hearted and easy going individual, open to strangers and willing to play pranks on even long-time friends, with the exception of his brother. Though he was not careless, recognizing whenever it was time to act serious and being a hard worker.
Norin was proficient in fighting with maces, staves, and warhammers. He was able to cast the spells create food and water, cure light wounds, detect magic, protection from fire, resist fire or cold, and slow poison. Unlike other clerics, he could not turn undead.
He possessed a ring of protection +1 and a ring of spell storing.
Whenever city officials or wealthy Ravenians wanted specialty meat, Norin hired out adventurers to acquire giant boars or other herd animals. And on the rare nights when he was not working at the Two Brothers Butchery, Norin spent his time at the local Dancing Bear Inn.
Norin was born the youngest member of the Bonebreaker family and the brother of Durto Bonebreaker.
At some point during his life, he was visited by a dwarven deity from another world, who called himself Kagyar the Immortal. The deity granted Norin his limited list of spells and asked of him to help those less fortunate, but to do so secretly. Ever since then he kept his priestly nature a secret and helped both the homeless and sick urchins.
Norin had romantic feelings for Gorla, a dwarf that had been recently hired by the Two Brothers Butchery.
