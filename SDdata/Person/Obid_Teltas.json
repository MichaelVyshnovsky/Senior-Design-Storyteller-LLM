        "mainbody": "'''Obid Teltas''' was the head of the [[Church of Lathander]] at the [[Morningstar Haven]] in [[Westgate]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Hail and welcome to the Morningstar Haven! I am none other than Obid Tellas, High Priest of Lathander. Westgate needs the guiding light of the Morninglord more than ever. It is fortunate that I assumed command of the temple when I did. Technically speaking, I suppose I'm not the real Hish Priest. Tylanna left me in charge while she's away. Still, one must consider it more than coincidence, eh? Obid Teltas rising to the fore as the city falls apart around him? It wouldn't surprise me if Lathander himself foresaw the need for a valiant leader and sent Tylanna away!''|Obid Teltas}}",
        "Description": "Obid was a red-faced of considerable girth who spoke with a nasal voice. His hair was mousy-grey, and his eyes had a bright blue color. He was a pompous and vain individual with shifty quick-moving eyes. His demeanor and posturing left him appearing insincere and boastful. Conversing with the man left people feeling as if they were in need of a long lensing bath.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Obid assumed control of the church of Lathander in the city during the time the high priestess [[Tylanna|Tylanna of the Seventh Rose]] was out of the city. He believed that under his rule, the followers of Lathander could destroy the [[Night Masks]]. He gained notoriety in the war against the Night Masks thanks to the success of an adventurer who recently arrived at Westgate in search of information on a ''cursed'' mask.\n\nWhen meeting with the adventurer for the first time, Obid unmistakenly detected a powerful ''curse'' placed on the mysterious item. He revealed that the ''domino mask'' once belonged to the Night Masks but now housed a trapped vengeful spirit. Obid's attempts to use divine magic were unsuccessful, and he doubted Westgate had a powerful enough [[wizard]] who specialized in cursed items. The priest suggested the hero investigate the spirit's nature in order to remove the curse, and she likely had some connection to the Night Masks. Obid had a lead for the adventurer. A priest named [[Jeswick Salem]] recently disappeared after complaining about being stalked. The High Priest suspected the Night Masks were responsible and sent the adventure to the priest's home in the [[Market Triangle]]. Subsequently, Obid was captured by the Night Masks and killed by the [[vampire]] cabal that ruled the guild."
