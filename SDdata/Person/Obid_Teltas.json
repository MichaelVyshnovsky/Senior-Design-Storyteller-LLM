        "mainbody": "Obid Teltas was the head of the Church of Lathander at the Morningstar Haven in Westgate circa 1374 DR.\nObid was a red-faced of considerable girth who spoke with a nasal voice. His hair was mousy-grey, and his eyes had a bright blue color. He was a pompous and vain individual with shifty quick-moving eyes. His demeanor and posturing left him appearing insincere and boastful. Conversing with the man left people feeling as if they were in need of a long lensing bath.\nIn the , Obid assumed control of the church of Lathander in the city during the time the high priestess Tylanna of the Seventh Rose was out of the city. He believed that under his rule, the followers of Lathander could destroy the Night Masks. He gained notoriety in the war against the Night Masks thanks to the success of an adventurer who recently arrived at Westgate in search of information on a cursed mask.\nWhen meeting with the adventurer for the first time, Obid unmistakenly detected a powerful curse placed on the mysterious item. He revealed that the domino mask once belonged to the Night Masks but now housed a trapped vengeful spirit. Obids attempts to use divine magic were unsuccessful, and he doubted Westgate had a powerful enough wizard who specialized in cursed items. The priest suggested the hero investigate the spirits nature in order to remove the curse, and she likely had some connection to the Night Masks. Obid had a lead for the adventurer. A priest named Jeswick Salem recently disappeared after complaining about being stalked. The High Priest suspected the Night Masks were responsible and sent the adventure to the priests home in the Market Triangle. Subsequently, Obid was captured by the Night Masks and killed by the vampire cabal that ruled the guild."
