Simon Dessino was a Lord of Arrabar, notable for his short reign circa 1370 DR.
Simon Dessino claimed the position of the Lord of Arrabar sometime before the . During his rule, Lord Dessino focused on two cities in particularâ€”Lachom and Nimpeth. Simon was actively trying to force Lachom to ask for Chondaths aid and increase Arrabars power. To achieve this goal, Lord Dessino hired a gang of fire giants from the Deepwing Mountains led by a witch doctor named Kinondra. The giants raided and burned down several farms outside of Lachom and were ready to mount several assaults to deal humiliating defeat to the citys defenders and force Lachom to seek aid from their old master nation.
Lord Dessinos relationship with Nimpeths Lord Woren was kept peaceful. Woren fed intel on other cities of Chondath and independent city-states to Lord Dessin, appeasing Arrabar. Of course, Lord Woren bent the facts to make himself and his city shine in the eyes of the Arrabarran ruler.
Simon Dessinos lordship over Arrabar ended sometime between 1370 and 1372 DR.
