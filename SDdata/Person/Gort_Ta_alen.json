Gort clad himself in armor, and wore a headband studded with a large gemstone.\nIn addition to his drow-style clothing and armor, Gort owned a ring of antivenom and a pair of bracers of the blinding strike.\nAs secondboy of his noble house, Gort had ambitions of furthering his station by killing his older brother. He perpetually sought to fight anyone he could, with the aim of growing strong enough to challenge his brother.\nEventually, he fought the planewalking adventurer Baloreik."
