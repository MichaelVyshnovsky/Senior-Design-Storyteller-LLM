Wrokeen was the lead hunter of the Golden Mane wemic pride that roamed the lands of the Shaar during the 14 century DR. In addition to her role as leader of the hunt, Wrokeen was generally accepted as the mother of the pride.
The powerful lioness spent most of her time scouting for the Golden Mane pride, tracking herds of prey animals, finding fresh watering holes, and scouting for possible enemies.
She had a lovely look, with elegant features and feline green eyes that were considered an exotic beauty by the nomadic Shaaran people. Wrokeen had flowing black hair that she kept tied up with a leather thong.
Easily the fastest member of the pride, Wrokeen was a naturally gifted scout and huntress, with a legendary skill with the bow. She had a keen sense of how to read signs of nature, which granted her kin insight on weather movements and possible nearby threats, especially those from combatants that had recently fought.
Wrokeen was the love and favored mate of the prides alpha and leader, Shaqar. In their years together, Wrokeen has borne seven cubs. As of 1373 DR, four of the cubs still lived with the pride, one of which was still so young that she personally cared for it. When Wrokeen was out on a hunt, her daughters would look over the wemic babe.
As a skilled huntress, Wrokeen kept a number of enchanted weapons including a +2 composite longbow, the accuracy of which was aided by her lesser bracers of archery. She had a magical haversack that allowed her to bring entire kills back to her prides camp in a single trip.
