ToZon was a korobokuru wu jen inhabiting the Rainbow Monastery in Ra-Khati during the midâ€“14 century DR.
ToZon stood 4 feet (1.2 meters) tall and had long shaggy hair.
A strong temper and unpredictable nature often spelled trouble for ToZun.
The Tuigan army forced ToZon into service when they passed through the region. However, he helped organize a desertion for some of the soldiers, eventually leading them to the Rainbow Monastery.
His wu jen taboo was to never cut his hair or bathe.
ToZon could cast the following spells magic missile, invisibility, detect invisible, fire shuriken, haste, protection from normal missiles, and wall of fire.
He could also focus his ki, allowing him to execute sudden bursts of speed that usually caught his opponents off-guard. His ki could also be used to magnify the effects of his spells.
ToZon wore a pair of bracers of defense.
