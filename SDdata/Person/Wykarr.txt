Wykarr was a fence and a member of the Shadow Thieves in Port Kir around 1370 DR.
Wykarr had a keen eye for details. He had a pleasant manner, but would not put up with rudeness. Many times he ejected greedy thieves or adventurers (whom he saw as much the same) from his store.
Wykarr worked as a tinsmith as a cover for his fencing activities. The upper floor of the store was a gambling hangout run by the Shadow Thieves and they often appeared to help Wykarr in case of problems.
