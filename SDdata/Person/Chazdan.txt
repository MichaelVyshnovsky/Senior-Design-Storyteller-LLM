"Lord" Chazdan was a man from the city of Procampur in the Vast in the late 12 and early 13 centuries DR.
He was a former noble of Procampur, but later turned pirate. He was among the great pirate lord Immurks fleet of 100 pirate ships at Dragonisle. The fleet broke apart following Immurks death in the Year of Embers, 1201 DR.
Chazdan arose out of this collapse to become a notorious and vicious pirate captain. He cruelly forced his prisoners to drink themselves to death with quarts (0.25 gallons or ~1 liter) of alcohol.
