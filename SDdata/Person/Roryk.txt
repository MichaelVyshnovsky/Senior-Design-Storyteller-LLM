Roryk was one of the co-owners of the Wyrmworks, located on Many Cats Lane in Silverymoon, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Roryk was a retired adventurer with white hair, beard, and mustache. He had a vertical scar through his left eye. He had lost some of his fighting trim and was getting a bit thick around the middle since he became a shopkeeper.Some descriptions are based on the artists rendering.
He was more forgiving and less hotheaded than his business partner, Delgrath, but very secretive about the compounds and techniques they used to clean and preserve dragon bits. Years of experience had taught him to be suspicious of people and the motives behind their speech and actions, especially those associated with the Red Wizards of Thay or the Arcane Brotherhood.
Roryk knew a great deal about dragons, both in general and about specific dragons that laired in northwest Faer√ªn. He was also well-versed in the techniques of preparing, transporting, and preserving dragon parts. He was a skilled bargainer and regularly haggled with customers over the price of their goods and services.
Roryk was co-owner of the Wyrmworks, which included a magically animated red dragons head that he named Old Roaring Rage.
He loved to talk about anything to do with dragons telling tales, discussing tactics, and hearing news of recent sightings.
He and Delgrath were good friends and were often seen together. The duo had a small group of loyal bodyguards that also acted as assistants in the shop. They were both quite fond of their young maid and shop girl, Alrue, and she loved them, affectionately calling them "the Old Boys".
Roryk and Delgrath retired from adventuring and opened their shop sometime around the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR. Business was slow at first, but once word got around, the shop turned a good profit and they contemplated opening another Wyrmworks in Waterdeep.
