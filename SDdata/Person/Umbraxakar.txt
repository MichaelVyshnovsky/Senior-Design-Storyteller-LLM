Umbraxakar was a shadow dragon companion of Vanrak Moonstar in Vanrakdoom, part of the vast Undermountain complex beneath Waterdeep.
Once Umbraxakar was a noble bronze dragon named Glyster allied with House Moonstar. When Vanrak and his followers escaped into Undermountain to escape punishment in the , Glyster was asked to find and capture the renegade noble. However, Glyster was somehow corrupted by Shars powers and turned into a shadow dragon who served as companion, guide, and mount to Vanrak. Nevertheless, Umbraxakar spent centuries lamenting the fall of Vanrak Moonstar, even after his redemption and death in the .
In 1492 DR, Lady Wylynd Moonstar, matriarch of the Moonstar noble family, asked a very competent adventuring party to find and somehow redeem Umbraxakar. Meanwhile, as a byproduct of Umbraxakars despair over the death of Vanrak, others experienced strange visions of his life and projections of dragon-shaped black fog at irregular intervals in some areas of Vanrakdoom.
Glyster was corrupted when he sank into despair for his failed attempts to redeem Vanrak. After Vanrak truly redeemed himself and died, Umbraxakar fell back into despair.
Glyster had a deep friendship with Vanrak and when the noble ranger turned to evil and to Shar the dragon tried all he could to save his friend. Instead, Glyster was also corrupted but he still valued his friendship with Vanrak.
Umbraxakar somehow gained the power to slide some areas of Vanrakdoom in and out of the Shadowfell.
