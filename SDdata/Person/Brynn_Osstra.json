        "mainbody": "Brynn Osstra was a farmer that lived in Nightstone with his family during the late 15 century DR.\nBrynn and his husband Thelbin farmed wheat within the safe confines of the walled village they called home. The couple lived in a cozy cottage with Brynns mother, sister, and his nephew Broland.\nSome time during the latter half of the 1480s DR, the Osstra family home was partially destroyed when cloud giants assailed Nightstone with stones from the sky. The villages residents fled for shelter in a nearby cave network but encountered a band of goblins led by Boss Hark. Many of the townsfolk were slain while others were taken as prisoners.\nWhile Brynn, Thelbin, and Broland managed to survive the traumatic ordeal, Brynns mother and sister were not so fortunate."
