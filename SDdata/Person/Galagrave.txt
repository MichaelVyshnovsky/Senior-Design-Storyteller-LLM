Galagrave was a one-eyed green hag who dwelt within Forestfall Fen in the late 15 century DR.
Galagrave served her "Queen", the black dragon Vorazidrar, and worked to aid in the expansion of Forestfall Fen by directing hungry ghasts to attack and rend the roots of healthy trees on the Fens borders, making it easier to corrupt and absorb them into the swamp.
When the expansion of Forestfall Fen was investigated by adventurers from Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR, Galagrave confronted them. She was defeated, but before she could be slain, she instead suddenly vanished after threatening the adventurers.
