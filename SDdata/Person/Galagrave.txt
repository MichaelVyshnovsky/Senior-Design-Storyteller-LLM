'''Galagrave''' was a one-eyed [[green hag]] who dwelt within [[Forestfall Fen]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Galagrave served her "Queen", the [[black dragon]] [[Vorazidrar]], and worked to aid in the expansion of Forestfall Fen by directing hungry [[ghast]]s to attack and rend the roots of healthy trees on the Fen's borders, making it easier to corrupt and absorb them into the swamp.

}}When the expansion of Forestfall Fen was investigated by [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Galagrave confronted them. She was defeated, but before she could be slain, she instead suddenly vanished after threatening the adventurers.
