        "Personality": "His growing fame had a bad effect on Marim. He became pompous and arrogant and prone to throwing a tantrum if he didn't get his way. However, he was very competent, knowing nearly every song from every culture across [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "History": "Marim was an entertainer and musician in Mulmaster, together with his band. In 1491 DR, the [[Blade]]s of the city competed with each other over the arts, and Marim became a top pawn in their proxy war, gaining great fame. One day, he was invited to play at a party hosted by Zor [[Faltyn Gos]]."
