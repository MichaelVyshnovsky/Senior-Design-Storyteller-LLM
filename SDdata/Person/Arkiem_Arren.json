        "mainbody": "Arkiem Arren was an elf cleric of Milil in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nArkiem was a tall and slender sun elf with a deep bronze skin and long, curly, blond hair.\nArkiem was usually smiling and of pleasant company, sharing few of the prejudices his people held against humans. He was a skillful musician and gave names to his personal instruments, leaving some to wonder whether those were magical. His talent with instruments often caused people to mistake him for a bard.\nArkiem favored simple clothes of white and green color, such as a tunic, jerkin, breeches, and soft leather boots. He wore no ornamental jewelry, apart from a golden oak-leaf clasp on his cloak. He always carried birdpipes on his belt.\nBack when he adventured, Arkiem used a cloak of displacement and some pipes of sounding.\nAfter building the Temple of Good Cheer with his wife Rachel Arren, Arkiem spent much of his time teaching music and playing nightly at the Safehaven Inn, in order to raise funds for the temple.\nArkiem joined the Harpers in 1329 DR. For most people in Waterdeep, his involvement with the Harpers was no more than a rumor."
