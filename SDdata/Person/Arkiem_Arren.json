        "mainbody": "'''Arkiem Arren''' was an [[elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Milil]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Arkiem was a tall and slender [[sun elf]] with a deep bronze skin and long, curly, blond hair.",
        "Personality": "Arkiem was usually smiling and of pleasant company, sharing few of the prejudices his people held against [[human]]s. He was a skillful musician and gave names to his personal instruments, leaving some to wonder whether those were magical. His talent with instruments often caused people to mistake him for a [[bard]].",
        "Possessions": "Arkiem favored simple clothes of white and green color, such as a tunic, jerkin, [[breeches]], and soft leather [[boots]]. He wore no ornamental jewelry, apart from a golden [[oak]]-leaf clasp on his [[cloak]]. He always carried [[birdpipes]] on his belt.\n\nBack when he adventured, Arkiem used a ''[[cloak of displacement]]'' and some ''[[pipes of sounding]]''.",
        "Activities": "After building the [[Temple of Good Cheer]] with his wife [[Rachel Arren]], Arkiem spent much of his time teaching music and playing nightly at the [[Safehaven Inn]], in order to raise funds for the temple.",
        "Relationships": "Arkiem joined the [[Harpers]] in [[1329 DR]]. For most people in Waterdeep, his involvement with the Harpers was no more than a rumor."
