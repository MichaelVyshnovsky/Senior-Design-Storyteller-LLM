Umar bin Farid was a dwarf and the adoptive son of an influential Zakharan merchant named Farid in Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Originally from Qudra, Umar was forced to flee the city under mysterious circumstances or be slain as his parents were.
Umar was fiercely loyal and protective of his adoptive father. He protected him during a blood feud with a desert clan called the House of Al-Karim.
Umar wielded a scimitar of speed and a jambiya. He typically wore leather armor.
