        "mainbody": "Morian was a Netherese priest who worked as an Underchief at Constabulary Branch Three in Eileanar before its destruction in .\nHe had black hair, a strong preference for gray clothing, and spoke in a smooth, unaccented baritone. He seemed to only ever be seen wearing the one gray suit, with a sword, dagger, and a pouch closed with a wire loop on his belt.\nMorian aided Chief Constable Emblemat alongside Underchiefs Goddard and Cadogen as they collectively managed the lower-ranked constables.\nHe appeared mysteriously in the enclave during the early spring of . The first thing he did was buy a piece of property in the city and apply for work as a constable, and little more than that was known by his fellows. He kept his house shuttered, took no guests, and had no family. It was rumored that a thief had once broken in, only to find the building empty of any furnishings or other possessions."
