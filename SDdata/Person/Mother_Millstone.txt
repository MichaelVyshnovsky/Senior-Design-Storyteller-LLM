Mother Millstone was the highest-ranking priest of the Faceless God among the vile yak-folk of the World Pillar Mountains in 1367 DR.
Mother Millstone oversaw the largest temple dedicated to the Faceless God. She was also the appointed governor of the Yaks Horn province and a member of the Seven Sages. Her territory overlapped into the fringes of the Haunted Lands, granting her access to a wide array of strange creatures.
It was rumored that Mother Millstone found a way to harness the bizarre spirits of the desert in the lowlands of the Haunted Lands bordering the World Pillar Mountains.
