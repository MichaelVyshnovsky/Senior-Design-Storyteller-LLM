==Description==
Davny was a [[human]] woman with pale skin, white-blonde hair, and blue eyes. She wore an officer's uniform of [[chainmail]], [[gauntlets]], and plate boots decorated with the Purple Dragons' insignia and [[dye]]d in Cormyte purples, and wielded an ornate [[greatsword]] in battle.

==Activities==
Constal Davny was stationed in the [[Wheloon Docks]] and oversaw investigations inside the prison alongside her superior Oversword [[Edric Crastmere]]. She was assisted in this by the [[Purple Dragon knight|Knights]] [[Hargrove Jalt]] and [[Faline Abbot]], [[Swordcaptain]] [[Iden Krell]], and [[Wizards of War]] [[Gaspry Bennik]] and [[Jacinta Last]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Constal Davny accompanied Wheloon's Magistrates [[Celia Pendrick]], [[Abella Toth]], and [[Barthold Moncrief]] to the town of [[Eveningstar]] in pursuit of an escaped prisoner, [[Dedryk Black]]. Subsequently, Davny involved a group of adventurers from the world of [[Eberron]] in defending Wheloon against an incursion by the [[Sharran]] servants of [[Returned Netheril]] as they attempted to subvert the city.
