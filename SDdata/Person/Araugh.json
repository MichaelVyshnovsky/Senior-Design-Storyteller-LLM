        "mainbody": "Araugh was a traveler and writer from Oslin in Chessenta in the 4 century DR. He wrote the travelogue chapbook Travels of Araugh around 350 DR.\nAraugh told of his journeys in a chatty and personal manner, and the man seemed as much of a rogue as the later travelogue writer Volo. His book became very popular as entertainment in the Vilhon Reach at the time.\nNotably, Araugh provided the earliest known, reliable identification of the Sunite relic the Sash of Sune. Araugh told of sighting a senior male Sunite priest dancing nude and alone in a meadow, but when he approached to investigate, guardian priests emerged from concealment and blocked him, explaining that the priest was calling for spells from Sune. Afterward, he plied priests with wine until they told him about the sash the man was dancing upon. Later, Araugh reported the Sash of Sune was stolen and how Sunites assaulted the house of a wizard in Arrabar to retrieve it, and theorized they had a way to track it."
