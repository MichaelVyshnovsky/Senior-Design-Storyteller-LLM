        "mainbody": "'''Araugh''' was a traveler and writer from [[Oslin]] in [[Chessenta]] in the 4{{th}} century [[DR]]. He wrote the travelogue chapbook ''[[Travels of Araugh]]'' around [[350 DR]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}\n\nAraugh told of his journeys in a chatty and personal manner, and the man seemed as much of a rogue as the later travelogue writer [[Volo]]. His book became very popular as entertainment in the [[Vilhon Reach]] at the time.\n\nNotably, Araugh provided the earliest known, reliable identification of the [[Church of Sune|Sunite]] relic the ''[[Sash of Sune]]''. Araugh told of sighting a senior male Sunite priest dancing nude and alone in a meadow, but when he approached to investigate, guardian priests emerged from concealment and blocked him, explaining that the priest was calling for spells from [[Sune]]. Afterward, he plied priests with [[wine]] until they told him about the sash the man was dancing upon. Later, Araugh reported the ''Sash of Sune'' was stolen and how Sunites assaulted the house of a [[wizard]] in [[Arrabar]] to retrieve it, and theorized they had a way to track it."
