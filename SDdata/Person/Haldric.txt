'''Haldric''' was a [[loremaster]] who settled in the quiet town of [[Nimbre]] in [[Samarach]], ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Possessions==
Haldric owned the biggest home in the sleepy village. Apart from a massive library, the loremaster's home held a small hidden magical study behind a secret door. One of the [[enchanted]] items stashed away there was a ''[[drum of haunting]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the villagers of Nimbre were accused of being associated and corrupted by the much-hated [[yuan-ti]], and the Samarach Patrol was rounding up the accused to stand trial in [[Samargol]]. Haldric, who was an outsider, felt little compassion for the doomed villagers. The loremaster considered the inhabitants of Nimbre to be dimwitted, and he only cared about the village remaining quiet to aid lore studies. Haldric did hide a dire secret. He was the dreaded [[yuan-ti]] that caused the village persecution. Haldric used a human guise to full most; however, his true identity could be exposed via a [[Zehir]] [[snake]] tattoo on his body.
