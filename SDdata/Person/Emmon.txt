}}'''Emmon''' was [[Marrec]]'s adoptive stepbrother, and his closest friend growing up.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|25-26|3}}
==History==
Unlike his siblings, who cared more for commerce, Emmon loved the wild just like Marrec did. He joined Marrec often in their treks, though he didn't share his martial prowess.

One night while they were kids, Emmon and Marrec were caught by a downpour of cold rain while out trekking on a dare. They sought shelter on a cave, where they came across an aggressive [[bear]]; Marrec managed to keep it at bay with a sharp stick, but not before Emmon was injured.

He took up a posting with the village militia together with Marrec, when the latter was sixteen years old. In spite of the extensive weapon drills, Emmon was still not a good swordsman. He took up arms in defense of the village when they were raided by the [[Durang]] [[ogre]]s, and was slain in that confrontation. The sight of his dead body allowed Marrec to unlock his [[medusa]] petrifying gaze.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|36-40|4}}
