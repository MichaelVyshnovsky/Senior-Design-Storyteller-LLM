Amarune was a rogue female malaugrym who posed as Nael Irlingstar, a noble heiress in Waterdeep for over three decades.
She first renounced the plots of her hellow malaugryms and lived secretly among the nobility of Waterdeep, in accordance with the Dark Decree of the Great Shadowmaster, Dhalgrave.
She even spawned children without authorization. Amarune and her children were little involved in the hunt for Shandril Shessair.
In 1370, the Unseen discovered her secret and forced her to collaborate with them in exchange for their silence.
In later years Amarune engineered the kidnapping and the disappearance of her "husband" and ordered the killing of many members of the Irlingstar family. She later allowed herself to be discovered by the War Wizards of Cormyr who put her in the prison of Castle Irlingstar. However Amarune escaped and started traveling in Western Heartlands and using guile, seduction, and murder, she amassed great wealth and influence.
Amarune lacked the discipline to become a true spellcaster. She had grown complacent by 1479 DR.
