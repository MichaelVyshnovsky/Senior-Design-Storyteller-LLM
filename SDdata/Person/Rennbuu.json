        "mainbody": "nnbuu was one of the newer slaad lords, younger than the likes of [[Chourst]], [[Ssendam]], or [[Ygorl]].\n\nDuring Rennbuu's \"Nature Period\" he used a mountain and a gigantic forest to create a bewildering monument to Mother Nature.",
        "Description": "Rennbuu appeared to be a gaunt, {{SIAdj|12|ft|adj=tall}} [[slaad]] with skin that glowed and swirled in a variety of radiant colors. In stark contrast to the ever-changing complexion of his scales, he also had a long mane of white, frazzled hair.",
        "Personality": {
            "Combat": "{{quote\n|There, you look much better in (blood) red.\n|Rennbuu\n}}\nThough he wouldn't hesitate to use his powerful claws and fangs in melee, Rennbuu preferred using the magic at his disposal, whether they be items or powers.

        },
        "Abilities": "[[File:Rennbuu-2e.jpg|thumb|273px|Rennbuu in the act of transforming a slaad's color.]]\nA great variety of [[spell]]-like abilities were at Rennbuu's disposal, including ''[[advanced illusion]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[darkness, 15' radius|darkness]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', ''[[rainbow pattern]]'', ''[[telepathy]]'', and ''[[wind walk]]'' at will. Thrice each day he could use ''[[flame strike]]'' and a ''[[symbol]]'' spell of his choice, and twice per day could use ''[[prismatic spray]]'' and ''[[prismatic wall]]''.\n\nThe Lord of Colors' most storied ability was his power to change the color of anything by touch alone. The new colors could be whatever combination of shades, tints, and patterns, including solids, stripes, and spots, that Rennbuu so chose. These transmutations could last anywhere from seconds to years to eternity and could only be prematurely undone by a ''[[wish]]'' spell. In addition, Rennbuu himself was immune to [[illusion]]s, as well as [[phantasm]]s.\n\nWhile he would be little more than a potent nuisance on other planes, the Lord of Colors wielded a power within [[Limbo]] that made him a dangerous force to be reckoned with. By changing the color of a slaad, he could actually change them into a different kind of slaad; a [[green slaad]] turned gray would become an actual [[gray slaad]] and vice versa. He could also summon either 5-6 [[blue slaad|blue]] or 6-8 [[red slaad]]i (with a 50% chance of getting either) to aid him with near-certainty.",
        "Realm": "Deep inside Limbo was Rennbuu's immaculate and impregnable gallery, a sizable collection of artwork he had created as well as any he found especially pleasing enough to bring there for display. Rennbuu was proud of his accomplishments and possessive regarding his creations, desiring his work to be preserved, and would devote entire rooms and even wings of the base to them. The pieces were carefully guarded by a large staff of red and blue slaadi who obeyed him mostly out of fear and partially out of the hope he might transform into a green slaad or better.",
        "Activities": "The Lord of Colors was a very busy slaad that roamed Limbo and other planes changing colors. Most experienced planar travelers could report coming across at least one of his \"fashion victims\" on their journeys.",
        "Relationships": "{{quote\n|Your armor is cheap but it suits you.\n|Another one of Rennbuu's taunts.\n}}\nMost red and blue slaadi revered Rennbuu as perhaps the only being capable of improving their lot in life as the weakest of their kind.

        "Rumors and Legends": "In a typical tale regarding Rennbuu, a [[gold dragon]] returned to her lair to find, much to her dismay, he turned her five hatchlings red, blue, green, black, and white. Their chromatic colorings caused a hard life for each of them."
