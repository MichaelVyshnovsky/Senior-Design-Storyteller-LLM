Calcitro Burrow was the mayor of Beluir in 1367 DR.
Due to his love of food and drink, Calcitro was a portly fellow. Most of his opponents took one look at him and dismissed him as a warrior, a mistake he took full advantage of.
As a member of the wealthy Burrow family, Calcitro helped manage their fruit plantation and several inns that they owned in the city.
Calcitro single-handedly dispatched a pair of giants in his youth, granting him legendary warrior status in Beluir.
Calcitro owned a nasty dagger of severing.
