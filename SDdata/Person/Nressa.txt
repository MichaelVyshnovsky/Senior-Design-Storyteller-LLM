'''Nressa the Weaver''' was one of the few inhabitants of [[Fallenfalcon]], a thorp along the [[Bowshot (Border Kingdoms)|Bowshot]] road in the wild realm of [[Owlhold]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Nressa and her family lived in one of the two cottages closest to the main pavilion in Fallenfalcon. She and her kin provided travelers who stayed at the camping pavilion with fresh [[bread]] and [[soup]], offering bigger meals upon request ahead of time.
