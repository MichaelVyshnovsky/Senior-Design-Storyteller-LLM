Nressa the Weaver was one of the few inhabitants of Fallenfalcon, a thorp along the Bowshot road in the wild realm of Owlhold in the Border Kingdoms.
By the late 14 century DR, Nressa and her family lived in one of the two cottages closest to the main pavilion in Fallenfalcon. She and her kin provided travelers who stayed at the camping pavilion with fresh bread and soup, offering bigger meals upon request ahead of time.
