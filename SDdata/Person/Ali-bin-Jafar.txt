Bertrem Thinwick, also known as Ali-bin-Jafar, was a shopkeeper in Skullport in 1370 DR.
Bertrem was a cunning Skullport native who understood that having an exotic name would help increase his business. So, under the name "Ali-bin-Jafar", he started selling carpets from Calimshan, Kara-Tur, Zakhara, and the Hordelands. Ali was a brilliant salesman and few who entered his shop departed empty handed. He also acted as a smuggler for Xanathars Thieves Guild and Misker.
