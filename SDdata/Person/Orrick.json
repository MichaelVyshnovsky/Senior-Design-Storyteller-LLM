        "mainbody": "Orrick the Grey was a wizard who dwelt in the Wizards Tower of the Severed Hand in the Spine of the World. He also owned Orricks Tower in Kuldahar in Icewind Dale.\nOrrick wore all gray robes and had gray hair. He fluttered around his tower, looking at old tomes with admiration. He carried no weapon, but he could disarm the burliest of fighters with a single look. He was about five and a half to six feet tall. He had gentle eyes.\nOrrick welcomed only those who came to him with a purpose. He tended to ignore events around him, good or evil, and didnt take sides in matters (unless they affected him directly). Thus he was named as a \"grey\" mage, rather than a \"white\" or \"black\" one.\nOrrick was first stationed in Kuldahar where he would sell spells and conduct research. He later moved to the Severed Hand to continue his research on mythals. Later, the Legion of the Chimera made the Hand their base. The grey wizard ignored the leaders of the Legion of the Chimera, as he was too focused on his research, and didnt consider them a serious threat to him. After a while, the legion became a threat to him, and both sides looked out for chance to strike. \nMany slaves happened to enter his tower in the Hand, and he returned many of them back to their homes. For those that wished to stay, he granted them a fair wage. Orrick would tell an adventurer many things, including the fact that the radiant pool would harm Isair and Madae if it was purified.\nAfter the mythal in the Hand collapsed, the whole building started to fall apart, burning and emitting a purple haze. He returned to Kuldahar, but didnt speak much. Much of his work on mythals was lost, and he had become old. One day, the Severed Hand completely collapsed, but amazingly Orricks tower in the Hand survived."
