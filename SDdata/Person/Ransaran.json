        "mainbody": "Ransaran was a skill weaponsmith inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nRansarans shop, which was called Ransarans Sergeant-at-Arms, was located in central Daggerford along Dukes Way. Ransaran charged steep prices for his weaponry, but given the exceptional quality of the weapons, most customers considered this to be more than fair.\nHe was close friends with the gnome Archiloque. Ransaran crafted a special set of short swords for Archiloque that included a series of straps and safety catches, allowing his friend to effectively wield the weapons with his arthritic hands."
