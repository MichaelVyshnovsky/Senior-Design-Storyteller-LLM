Per Sylun√© of the Chosen, Mystra told him, during Mystras Choice, \"You are more Banes creature than mine. Go where you belong\". He was also recorded to have been slain in a battle with a dozen archmages, prime amongst which was the next magister, Thornar Fleetmoor.\nSome folk believed that Mystra punished him for his wickedness by tearing away all knowledge of magic from his mind."
