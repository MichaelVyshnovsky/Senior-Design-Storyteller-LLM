        "mainbody": "'''Ason''' was pickpocket brother of [[Ginia]] the courtesan from the isle of [[Brynnlaw]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I gotta go! I'm sorry about your money... I don't like stealing... I gotta go!''|Ason}}",
        "Description": "During his time on the island, Ason was a child with chestnut hair.",
        "History": "Ason and his sister Ginia were raised in Brynnlaw since birth. Their mother died very early on, whilst their father was a tailor. Early on, Ginia was offered employment at the [[Spellhold]] asylum. After Brynnlaw fell under the control of [[Desharik]], Ason's father was sentenced to death for breaking the law set out by the pirate king. Desharik told the newly orphaned Ginia that she had to pay for her father's crime, as his death wasn't enough. She was given to [[Chremy]], his lieutenant as a reward for his service, who sent her to work as a courtesan against her will. If she refused, Chremy threatened to slaughter Ason, who, in turn, was forced to work for the pirate as a pickpocket on Brynnlaw's streets.\n\nIt was rumored that Ginia and her brother were eventually smuggled out of the island by [[Calahan]] with help from [[Abdel Adrian]] who sought entrance to Spellhold in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. Calahan agreed to take the youths to the village of [[Ulgoth's Beard]], not far from [[Baldur's Gate]], for a fee, where they would be raised by a woman named [[Therella]]."
