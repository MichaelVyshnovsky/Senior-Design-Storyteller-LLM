Their mother died very early on, whilst their father was a tailor. Early on, Ginia was offered employment at the Spellhold asylum. After Brynnlaw fell under the control of Desharik, Asons father was sentenced to death for breaking the law set out by the pirate king. Desharik told the newly orphaned Ginia that she had to pay for her fathers crime, as his death wasnt enough. She was given to Chremy, his lieutenant as a reward for his service, who sent her to work as a courtesan against her will. If she refused, Chremy threatened to slaughter Ason, who, in turn, was forced to work for the pirate as a pickpocket on Brynnlaws streets.\nIt was rumored that Ginia and her brother were eventually smuggled out of the island by Calahan with help from Abdel Adrian who sought entrance to Spellhold in the . Calahan agreed to take the youths to the village of Ulgoths Beard, not far from Baldurs Gate, for a fee, where they would be raised by a woman named Therella."
