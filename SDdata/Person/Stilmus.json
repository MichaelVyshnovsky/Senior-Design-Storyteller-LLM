        "Personality": "Stilmus was obsessed with honor and he never broke his word. For Stilmus, someone cheating him or his company was a challenge to his honor, a very serious matter. He fought many duels over this and sometimes drove the company on a quest for vengeance. Stilmus hated [[Helyos]] and hoped there would come a day when the [[Society of the Sword]] crush the [[Renegades]] and Helyos.",
        "History": "Stilmus fought in many conflicts. During one of those conflicts he was in the same mercenary company as Helyos but Helyos tried to kill him.\n\nLater, Stilmus joined the Society of the Sword and by [[1358 DR]] he was the leader of the Company."
