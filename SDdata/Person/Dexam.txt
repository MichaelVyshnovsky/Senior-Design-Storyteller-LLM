'''Dexam''' was a capricious [[beholder]] ally of [[Fzoul Chembryl]] of the [[Zhentarim]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Dexam had a lair within [[Zhentil Keep]] where he was served by a hooded woman (secretly a [[medusa]]) and a small gang of [[minotaur]]s. In the same year, Dexam sought to uncover the secret of the creation of the ''[[azure bonds]]'', magical [[tattoo]]s that could create unwilling slaves. The fickle beholder came to a conflict with a group of heroes branded with the ''bonds.'' Some said the beholder disintegrated Fzoul Chembryl over the secret. However, that was untrue, as the leader of the Zhentarim reappeared unharmed shortly after.
