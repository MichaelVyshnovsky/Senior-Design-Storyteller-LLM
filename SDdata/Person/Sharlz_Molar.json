The elf wore embroidered finery.\nIn the , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldurs Gate, Sharlz Molar could be found gossiping in the Lower City with his friend â€“ Iza Blouin. Iza eagerly consumed the Baldurs Mouth Gazetteer, and even though she knew one should not believe every word that the broadsheet printed, Iza still avoided associating with individuals who were bad-mouthed by the publication. Unlike his friend, Sharlz insisted that everything in the Gazette was lies and encouraged anyone who was shown in the broadsheet in bad light."
