        "mainbody": "'''Chaid al Farid al Fuqani''' was a [[Tethyr]]ian [[human]] [[mage]] who was an apprentice of [[Blackstaff Tower]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Chaid had dusky skin, jet-black curly hair, and bronze-colored eyes.\n\nBeing from the warmer climates of the south, he tended to dress in thicker clothing to stay warm.",
        "Relationships": "Chaid's twin brother was [[Tarik al Farid al Fuqani]]. His teacher was [[Tsarra Chaadren]].",
        "Personality": "Chaid's personality was in many ways the opposite of his twin's. He was quiet and thoughtful. One of his peers, the young [[elf]] [[Walaxyrvaan|Lynx]] called him ''[[ivaebhin]]'' \"brightness-filled boy\".",
        "History": "He was originally from [[Myratma]] in [[Tethyr]] but had resided as an apprentice at the Blackstaff Tower in [[Waterdeep]] from a young age, having been sent there by his father along with his brother. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, they were both ten years old.\n\nOn [[Uktar 28]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, he found his [[weasel]] [[familiar]] [[Brakar (weasel)|Brakar]] during a hunt in the [[Pellamcopse Woods]] under the supervision of Tsarra Chaadren. He named the little animal after the [[Brakar|official coin]] used in [[Darromar]], the capital of Tethyr, but only after asking the creature if it would like to be named. The fact that he had found a familiar made his twin brother jealous.\n\nOn the return trip to Waterdeep, they all passed a [[thief]] named [[Raegar Stoneblade]], who had been secretly stalking them, but they were unaware of his significance at the time. Later that same day, Chaid and his brother used [[floating disk]]s to dump salt on a [[nishruu]] that had attacked Blackstaff Tower and defeated it. They had become familiar with nishruu from hearing bedtime stories from Tsarra."
