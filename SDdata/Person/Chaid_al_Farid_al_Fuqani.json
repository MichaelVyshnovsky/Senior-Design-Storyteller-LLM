His teacher was Tsarra Chaadren.\nChaids personality was in many ways the opposite of his twins. He was quiet and thoughtful. One of his peers, the young elf Lynx called him ivaebhin \"brightness-filled boy\".\nHe was originally from Myratma in Tethyr but had resided as an apprentice at the Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep from a young age, having been sent there by his father along with his brother. In the , they were both ten years old.\nOn Uktar 28, the , he found his weasel familiar Brakar during a hunt in the Pellamcopse Woods under the supervision of Tsarra Chaadren. He named the little animal after the official coin used in Darromar, the capital of Tethyr, but only after asking the creature if it would like to be named. The fact that he had found a familiar made his twin brother jealous.\nOn the return trip to Waterdeep, they all passed a thief named Raegar Stoneblade, who had been secretly stalking them, but they were unaware of his significance at the time. Later that same day, Chaid and his brother used floating disks to dump salt on a nishruu that had attacked Blackstaff Tower and defeated it. They had become familiar with nishruu from hearing bedtime stories from Tsarra."
