        "mainbody": "'''Fengla''' was a young female [[svirfneblin]] of the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Branded on the skin of Fengla's right forearm was her name and on one of her wrists was a symbol of a [[pickaxe]], the emblem of the bandit [[Marketh]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1281 DR]], Fengla and the rest of her clan were enslaved by the mad [[wizard]] [[Malavon Despana]], the bandit [[Marketh]], and their boss [[Belhifet]]. At some point during her enslavement, Malavon's insanity drove him to cut out the tongue of Fengla and several of her other kin.\n\nWhile enslaved, one of Fengla's duties was to bring food to the bandit guards stationed within a watchtower in the southeastern section of the Lower Depths of [[Dorn's Deep]]. Often this took the form of [[apple]]s and [[wine]]. When a group of [[adventurer]]s eventually came that year to put an end to Belhifet's plans, she gifted them the key to this tower and afterwards thanked them for their help in freeing her people."
