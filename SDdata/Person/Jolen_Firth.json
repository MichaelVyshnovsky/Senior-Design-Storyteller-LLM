The [[Companions of the Hall]] aided him and his forces in defending the city, but soon after the Companions' departure, the city was overcome by the orc forces and the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]]. All but 600 of the inhabitants were killed; the rest were taken prisoner. The [[drow]] [[Tiago Baenre|Tiago]] and [[Saribel Baenre]] were named Duke and Duchess of Nesme, and Tiago sentenced Jolen to be crucified in front of the city's main gate."
