Khaligeira Moonthumb was a cursed adventurer inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
When not adventuring, she enjoyed fishing and gardening. However, she was mostly retired due to a bizarre curse. Several tentacles would spring from her back and arms at random times, making her life difficult to say the least. She spent her time training green warriors and adventurers and outfitting them with equipment from her shop, Moonthumb Necessities located on Ooloolar Street in Tulmon.
She was fierce when needed and known for her vicious uppercut. One a dare she once knocked out an entire platoon of Stone Spears.
Khaligeira was originally from Turmish.
