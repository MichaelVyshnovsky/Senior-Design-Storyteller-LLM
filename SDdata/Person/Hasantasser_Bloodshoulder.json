He was also a member of the [[Rogues of Tilverton]].\n\nHasantasser actually kept pet frogs. He released one within the inn every time the Rogues pulled off a successful heist. Some of his frogs had yellow markings, alerting fellow Rogues in distress that they could use the small packet of ''[[dust of disappearance]]'' secured to the frog's belly."
