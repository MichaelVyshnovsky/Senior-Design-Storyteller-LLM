Golden Gorger Suntunavick was a deep gnome cleric from Blingdenstone. He was head priest at the Ruby of the Rough temple to Segojan Earthcaller and was charged with the care of a number of cave badgers.
Around  1358 DR, Suntunavick and a few other svirfneblin priests opened a pathway from the Underdark to the surface to allow Belwar Dissengulp, Firble, and three hundred other svirfneblin soldiers to aid in the defense of Mithral Hall.
