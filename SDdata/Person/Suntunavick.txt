Golden Gorger '''Suntunavick''' was a [[deep gnome]] [[cleric]] from [[Blingdenstone]]. He was head priest at the [[Ruby of the Rough]] temple to [[Segojan Earthcaller]] and was charged with the care of a number of cave badgers.

==History==
Around  [[1358 DR]], Suntunavick and a few other [[svirfneblin]] priests opened a pathway from the [[Underdark]] to the surface to allow [[Belwar Dissengulp]], [[Firble]], and three hundred other [[svirfneblin]] soldiers to aid in the defense of [[Mithral Hall]].
