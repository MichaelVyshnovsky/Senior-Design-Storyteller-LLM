        "mainbody": "'''Tantarn''' was an innkeeper of the midâ€“14th century [[DR]]. He managed [[Tantarn's Inn]] in [[Llorkh]].",
        "History": "Tantarn once managed an inn in the city of [[Iriaebor]], and became very experienced at the business. However, with [[Zhent]]-caused troubles there, he suffered financially and was forced to move.\n\nHe came to the town of Llorkh, though it too was in the grip of the [[Zhentarim]], in order to establish a new inn. It opened some time after the Zhentarim takeover of Llorkh in [[1357 DR]], less than a month after [[Worried Wyvern (Llorkh)|the only inn]] in town burned down after [[Phintarn's brother|its owner]] died. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly inns. Tantarn's Inn, as it was called, was in business by [[1370 DR]]. It was a pleasant establishment."
