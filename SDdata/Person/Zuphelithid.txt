'''Zuphelithid''' was the [[elder brain]] that enthralled a community of [[svirfneblin]] near the ruins of [[Dolblunde]] for a time during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You're far from your temple, paladin. Elder brain Zuphelithid is the only god here. But we'd gladly accept you as a devoted acolyte.|Zuphelithid, to [[Xenk Yendar]].}}

==Activities==
Zuphelithid and its [[mind flayer]] followers enslaved a group of [[deep gnome]]s in order to find and claim an [[artifact]] known as the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]''. The elder brain sought to use the helm to break into the ruins of Dolblunde.

==History==
[[File:Xenk vs Zuphelithid.png|thumb|right|''Zuphelithid's demise at the hands of [[Xenk Yendar]].''|290x290px]]

Some time during the late 1400s DR,<ref group="note">Trick's story related to the ''helmet of disjunction'' occurs some time after the [[Battle of the Evermoors]].The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves''.{{HAT-time}} Zuphelithid dispatched mind flayer agents to recover the ''Helm of Disjunction'' from the stalwart, [[Thay]]an paladin [[Xenk Yendar]]. While the elder brain's plan failed, an intrepid pair of deep gnomes―who hoped to save their family from Zuphelithid's tyranny―managed to steal the helm from the paladin themselves.

The deep gnomes convinced Xenk Yendar to save their people, in a foolhardy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt of righteous do-goodery. The plan worked to Zuphelithid's advantage however, as the foolish gnomes allowed the ''Helm of Disjunction'' to fall into the elder brain's clutches. Unfortunately, the stubborn paladin and hapless gnomes would not be deterred. The gnomes drove a massive drill into Zuphelithid's lair, while the 
paladin from Thay broke into its inner lair, and slew the elder brain.
