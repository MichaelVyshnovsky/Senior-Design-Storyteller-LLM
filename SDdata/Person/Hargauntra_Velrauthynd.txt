'''Hargauntra Velrauthynd''', called the Lady Master of the Waves, was a shipbuilder of luxurious warships from the city of [[Saerloon]] active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Hargauntra Velrauthynd was renowned for creating warships with "pamper-cabins", fanciful trimmings, and exquisite brass railings. The ships were mounted with [[mangonel]]s and experimental [[ballista]]e. Hargauntra's construction was done slowly and for a lavish price. Hargauntra's warships were used as flagships and vessels of kings and rulers.
