Hargauntra Velrauthynd, called the Lady Master of the Waves, was a shipbuilder of luxurious warships from the city of Saerloon active in the late 15 century DR.
Hargauntra Velrauthynd was renowned for creating warships with "pamper-cabins", fanciful trimmings, and exquisite brass railings. The ships were mounted with mangonels and experimental ballistae. Hargauntras construction was done slowly and for a lavish price. Hargauntras warships were used as flagships and vessels of kings and rulers.
