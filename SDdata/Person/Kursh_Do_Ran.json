        "mainbody": "'''Kursh Do Ran''', also known by his title, '''Grinds the Sand''', was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[sha'ir]] planeswalker from [[Zakhara]] and a member of a trans-dimensional organization called the [[Order of the Eternals]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Honorable ones! What sort of insanity is it that some of those upon your world practice? To defile that which is most rare, most precious, most blessed, in such a vile way... Why would any do such a thing? Further, what of those who sicken from it? In the name of the compassionate, the merciful, why?!''|Kursh Do Ran}}",
        "Description": "Kursh wore a beard, typical for the men and women of his race, but kept it immaculately clean. The beard was long and was usually tucked into his [[belt]]. Kursh wore a [[turban]].",
        "Personality": "The Dwarven Mage was an uppity erudite with a loud personality prone to rants. He was among very few individuals from the world of [[Toril]], along with [[Elminster Aumar]], who knew what a micro-organism was. If Kursh Do Ran was asked to teach magic to other dwarves of non-Zakharan origin, the Dwarven Mage always refused to share his craft. He did not like to lie nor brag and was a dedicated \"worshiper\" of the elements and the genie-kind.",
        "Abilities": "Through his impressive magical prowess and his [[earth gen]] [[familiar]], Kursh Do Ran had access to virtually any spell, including [[priest]]ly magics. Like others of his kin, the Dwarven Mage possessed [[infravision]]. He could intuitively detect depth whilst underground, detect grades of slopes in passages, new tunnels or passage construction, sliding or shifting walls or rooms, stonework traps, pits, and deadfalls. Thanks to his affinity with the [[genie]]s, he was resistant to elemental, and especially earth elemental attacks.",
        "Relationships": "[[Lil' Mountain]] was Kursh's loyal [[daolani]]n familiar, a quick-witted and spirited individual, just like his master, who would fetch spells from across the planes on command for the Dwarven Mage.",
        "History": "When the Order of the Eternals elected to hold its 1,238{{th}} annual [[Symposium]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], in order to secretly investigate its unusually high levels of magical energies and planar incursions, Kursh Do Ran was among the guests and members who stayed at [[Glittering Star Inn]] for the multi-day event.\n\nThe Symposium did not go smoothly as a notorious villain known as the [[Sewer Lich]] attempted to burglarize one of the ranking members of the Order using several employees of the inn. One of them was [[Sally (Ravens Bluff)|Sally]], who was murdered soon after the burglary, her head and heart tossed into the inn's well. The Dwarven Mage was the only guest who managed to notice there was something foul in the inn's water offered to the event's attendee; he went on long rants about how such a backwater place as the Bluff served water tainted with [[poison]]s, toxins, and \"micro-organisms.\" His rant helped several [[mage]] adventurers of the [[Living City]] to discover the truth about Sally's death."
