        "mainbody": "'''Falias Emberthumb''' was a [[halfling]] merchant who sold mundane goods, cloth, and dresses from [[Waterdeep]] in the city of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' 1372 DR.",
        "Description": "Falias Emberthumb was a portly halfling with a bold head, crow-like nose, dandy grommet mustache, and a small beard.",
        "Personality": "He was a nervous fellow who often sweated profusely when stressed, wrangling his hands. He was very polite and proper, and bowed according to customs even when interacting with his own employees.",
        "Possessions": "Falias Emberthumb's regular caravan consisted of three wagons drawn by six [[ox]]en.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Falias Emberthumb hired mercenaries to accompany his caravan from Waterdeep to Daggerford, a shipment of ladies' gowns. One of the hirelings was an experienced [[fighter]], [[Talarenne]], and the other would later become the hero of Daggerford, and another. They traveled along the [[Trade Way]] until the caravan was stopped by a recently fallen tree. This was a scene of an ambush by a group of mysterious bandits (in reality, [[Zhentarim]] agents). As the attackers were defeated, Falias assumed the attacks be simple foolish robbers who foolishly attacked a shipment of clothes.\n\nReaching the safety of Daggerford's walls, Falias made sure his surviving injured guard received the best care. The halfling merchant felt honor-bound to offer the hero of Daggerford one of his best dresses as a reward for the job well done, and opened up a stall in the city's marketplace, not far from the [[Daggerford Castle]]."
