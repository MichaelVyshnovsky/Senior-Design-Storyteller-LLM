Maklin Mucklar was a gnome alchemist in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
Maklin sold his alchemical products inside the Yawning Portal inn with the permission of Durnan.
In 1479 DR, a male human arrived at the Yawning Portal accusing Maklin of selling to him years ago in Baldurs Gate a poisoned healing potion that caused the death of his companion.
Durnan really appreciated the kickbacks that Maklin gave him.
Maklin was a distant and aloof individual. Many considered him quite odd but Durnan believed him an honest guy.
