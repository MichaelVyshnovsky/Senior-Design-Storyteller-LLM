'''Khartach''' was a [[pit fiend]] member of [[Glasya]]'s special guard.

==History==
On [[Hammer 10]] of [[1487 DR]], Khartach was sent to [[Djerad Thymar]] by Glasya to lead a detachment of the Malbogean forces to help the [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] against [[Gilgeam]]'s [[demon]] army, during the last battle of the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]], and in doing so also to help [[Asmodeus]] to retain his divinity.
