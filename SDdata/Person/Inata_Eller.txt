Inata Eller was a wizard sage specializing in the Outer Planes in the Vilhon Reach in 1358 DR.
Inata studied under her second cousin, Gustofsen Eller, probably the most renowned planar expert in the Realms.
In 1358 DR, she was hired by a gathering of leaders of both Chondath and Turmish to discuss the menace of the arcanaloth Yrkhetep. She advised them that she had learned from a vision that Yrkhetep was building a doomsday device called the Infinity Train and that it must be destroyed. (In truth, the vision was granted by Anthraxus.)
Inata then guided the Iron Legion to Hades for the last battle with Yrkhetep.
Inata was well known for her integrity. However, she was shy and naive.
