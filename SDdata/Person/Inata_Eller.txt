'''Inata Eller''' was a wizard sage specializing in the [[Outer Planes]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Inata studied under her second cousin, [[Gustofsen Eller]], probably the most renowned planar expert in the [[Realms]].

In 1358 DR, she was hired by a gathering of leaders of both [[Chondath]] and [[Turmish]] to discuss the menace of the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]]. She advised them that she had learned from a vision that Yrkhetep was building a doomsday device called the [[Infinity Train]] and that it must be destroyed. (In truth, the vision was granted by [[Anthraxus]].)

Inata then guided the [[Iron Legion]] to [[Hades]] for the last battle with Yrkhetep.

==Personality==
Inata was well known for her integrity. However, she was shy and naive.
