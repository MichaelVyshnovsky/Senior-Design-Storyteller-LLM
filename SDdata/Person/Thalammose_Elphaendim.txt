'''Thalammose "The Old Elf" Elphaendim''' was the patriarch of the noble merchant [[House Elphaendim]] of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Thalammose was a quiet, contemplative man who mentored his favorite young grandniece, [[Cauvra Elphaendim]], in the use of her burgeoning [[wizard]]ly talents. The training was done in some secrecy. However, many rumors about their arcane skills floated around Arrabar. The Old Elf was worried for his grandniece's talents being misused or abused were she released into the world without his guidance. Thalammose's personality was a stark contrast to his nephew's – [[Brastynbold Elphaendim]]'s, who was a boisterous bear of a man.

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 13]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Thalammose "The Old Elf" Elphaendim attended [[Emriana Matrell]]'s grand sixteenth birthday celebration at the [[Matrell]] estate. Brastynbold and Cauvra accompanied the patriarch of their family to the event. All three were present at the party and, along with other guests, witnessed an assassination attempt at the matriarch of [[House Matrell]] – [[Hetta Matrell]].
