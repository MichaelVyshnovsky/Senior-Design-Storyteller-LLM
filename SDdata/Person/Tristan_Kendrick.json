        "Description": "Tristan was a dashing, tall, wide-shouldered man with a thick beard, covering half of his chest, and dark brown hair.",
        "Personality": "As a youth, Tristan was a long-suffering child, chafing at his duties as a prince.\n\nAs he grew older, he became a popular lad, with many friends, but few who actually respected him, trying to find a place for himself in the world which didn't revolve around his royalty. While outwardly carefree, this hid internalized feelings of inadequacy that took a long while to overcome.\n\n[[Kazgaroth]]'s attack on his home changed him some. Although he still had the same struggles as before, he was preoccupied with the absence of his great love, and concern for his countrymen, which gave him an air of desperation.\n\nAs King, he finally took his responsibilities to heart and became renowned for his fairness. His inner peace shone through his outward personality, particularly after he retired.\n\nThroughout his life though, Tristan was easily fooled by friendly manners. However, once he realized that he had been duped, he got angry, and was driven to revenge.",
        "Possessions": "In public, Tristan wore a heavy wool [[wikipedia:cloak|cloak]] over his leather [[trousers]] and dark leather boots.\n\nIn battle, he donned a suit of [[banded mail]] armor and wielded a longsword.\n\nWhile on a mission to rescue [[Keren Donnell]], he serendipitously found the ''[[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]]'' hidden in a treasure chamber within a [[Firbolg]] stronghold.{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|2568}} Keren recognized it for what it was and told Tristan that the weapon must be wielded by whoever finds it.{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|2579}}",
        "Relationships": {
            "Family": "Tristan had a difficult relationship with his father, [[Bryon Kendrick|King Bryon]], who partly blamed Tristan for his [[Addee Kendrick|wife's]] death after giving birth. The king's determination to make Tristan a good heir to the throne of Corwell made the lad bristle in rebellion and the two never really reconciled before Bryon was killed.\n\nHe grew up with a girl named [[Robyn Kendrick|Robyn]], who at first he believed to be his sister, but eventually, when he discovered that she was just his father's ward, began to have romantic feelings for her. Eventually the two married and had two daughters together. They named them [[Deirdre Kendrick|Deirdre]] and [[Alicia Kendrick|Alicia]].\n\nDeirdre, his older daughter, was a powerful sorceress, and had an interest in the gods of the mainland as a means to increasing her own power.<ref>\n\nAlicia followed in her mother's footsteps as a [[druid]], and later became Tristan's heir.<ref>"

        "Biography": {
            "Darkwalker War": "In their absence, Corwell had, as predicted, been invaded by [[Northlander]]s and firbolgs. Tristan united the [[Sisters of Synnoria]] and a group of dwarves with his own party into a united force against the Northlanders. Under Tristan's leadership, his impromptu battalion broke the Northlanders and Tristan himself wounded Kazgaroth, who had been disguised as [[Thelgar Ironhand]] of [[Oman]], finally bringing The Beast low through a combination of swordcraft and druidic magic.",
            "Becoming High King": "[[File:Old Tristan Kendrick.png|thumb|''Aged Tristan Kendrick as the High King.''|325x325px]]\nDespite his heroics, he still struggled to earn the respect of his father, leading to further strain on their relationship. He was supposed to be helping to rebuild Corwell, but Tristan spent a lot of his time carousing, despairing at the absence of his love, Robyn, who was off training under her aunt, the Great Druid. A [[Thay]]an wizard named [[Cyndre]] hired [[assassin]]s to kill Tristan, King Bryon, and to steal the ''Sword of Cymrych Hugh''. They only succeeded in murdering the king. Tristan had a political rival in the form of a local lord named [[Pontswain]], who said that the High King, [[Reginald Carrathal]] should decide Bryon's successor, not Tristan's lineage. On the way to [[Callidyr]] to see the High King, their ship sank due to sabotage. They met the [[ghost]] of Queen [[Allisyn]] who told them that Tristan would pick a descendant of [[Cymrych Hugh]] as the next High King and give him the ''Sword''. On [[Alaron]], Tristan was arrested on charges of wanting to assassinate the High King.\n\nJoining up with Robyn and an outlaw nobleman named [[O'Roarke]], Tristan and company battled Cyndre, High King Carrathal, and a [[Church of Bhaal|Bhaalyn]] priest named [[Hogarth]]. Victorious, Tristan was visited by the [[Earthmother]] who said that Tristan was the descendant of Cymrych that Allisyn had prophesied, indeed, the dwarf [[Finellan]] informed him that Kendrick was a variant of the name Cymrych that was still in use when he was young. Tristan was therefore named High King.",
            "As High King": "The evil priest Hobarth was still alive however, and had managed to corrupt one of the Earthmother's [[Moonwell]]s. While sailing, Tristan came to the aid of a Northlander ship, under attack from [[sahuagin]]. It turned out that the ship's captain was none other than King [[Grunnarch]] of [[Norland]], and Tristan's aid was the first step in forging an alliance between the Northlanders and the Ffolk. While celebrating the alliance, Tristan was seduced by the Great Druid [[Genna Moonsinger]], Robyn's aunt, who had been corrupted by Hobarth. Incensed, Robyn left the banquet hall and flew to Myrloch Vale to deal with Hobarth herself. She refused to forgive Tristan when he caught up to her.\n\nA [[displacer beast]] under [[Bhaal]]'s command attacked Daryth and killed him. Tristan blamed himself. Upon reaching the corrupted moonwell, the party encountered the avatar of Bhaal himself who began killing the Vale's druids. Tristan threw the ''Sword of Cymrych Hugh'' into the well and Bhaal was banished back to the [[Throne of Blood]]. High off of their success, Tristan proposed to Robyn, and she accepted. They were married in the winter. Two years later, their daughters, Deirdre and Alicia had been born.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, on the way back from a trading mission to [[Amn]] for food, Tristan's ship was sunk by sahuagin. He was taken to the city of [[Kyrasti]], where his left hand was removed, to be delivered back to his family as evidence that he had been captured. Tristan temporarily suffered from amnesia, and had only recently recovered his memories when Robyn and Alicia arrived to rescue him. Tristan tried and failed to restore his lost hand with magic, and partly as a result, his daughter Deirdre was killed.\n\nTristan abdicated, and retired to the Myrloch Vale with Robyn, giving his crown to his surviving daughter, Alicia."
