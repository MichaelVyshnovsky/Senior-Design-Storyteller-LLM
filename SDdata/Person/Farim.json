        "mainbody": "Farim was a human mamluk who lived in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nFarim was a handsome man.\nHe was a member of the Valiant Mamluk Society, but served as the bodyguard of the shair Qohadar and was rarely seen apart from her. He disliked senseless violence, so only drew his weapon as a last resort.\nDuring a past adventure, Farim was accidentally splashed with a magical oil that caused Qohadar to fall in love with him.\nThough the magical oil wore off long ago, Qohadar remained infatuated with Farim.\nFarim owned a set of armor of the desert evening and a gold-hilted scimitar."
