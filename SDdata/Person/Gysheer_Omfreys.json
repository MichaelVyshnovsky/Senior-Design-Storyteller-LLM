        "mainbody": "ysheer Omfreys was a worshiper of Asmodeus in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.\nIn 1492 DR, Gysheer instigated some spined devils to terrorize people in the Field Ward of Waterdeep. This attracted the attention of Savra Belabranta, who, under orders of the Order of the Gauntlet, hired some adventurers to eliminate the devils, eventually discovering and defeating Gysheer.\nGysheer was a member of the devil cult led by Victoro Cassalanter, but only magical compulsion could force her to implicate Victorio."
