        "mainbody": "Taharak was once a powerful warrior among the drow of Maerimydra in life, before rising as a ghost after his death.\nTaharak cut an impressive figure in his full plate armor, even more so when wearing his leering skull helm and astride his nightmare steed. In battle, Taharak wielded a spiked chain.\nBefore his death, Taharak fought for Lolth. However, after dying he took up the cause of Kiaransalee, rising anew as a deadly ghostly champion.\nDuring Lolths Silence in Maerimydra, the rising cult of Kiaransalee there put him to work as a scout, collecting the corpses of the fallen and bringing them back to Castle Maerimydra for reanimation by Irae Tsarrans servants.\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Middledark\nCategoryInhabitants of Maerimydra\nCategoryInhabitants of Castle Maerimydra\nCategoryWorshipers of Kiaransalee\nCategoryGhosts\nCategoryWorshipers of Lolth\n1owyd26q679c7026pz6cdidkehiws8s"
