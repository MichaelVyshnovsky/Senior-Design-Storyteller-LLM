'''Stonekiller''' was a [[dwarf]] adventurer in [[Maztica]].

==History==
Stonekiller was going about his business when he was snatched by a cadre of riders and dragged back to [[Ulatos]]. There he met newcomers from [[Faer√ªn]]. When he was finally put back out on the street, he was full of curiosity about these strangers. He wanted answers to all his questions and believed that he could find it in [[Nexal]].

==Personality==
Stonekiller was fascinated by the [[Amn]]ians, whom he believed were crazier than [[Nexalan]]s, for their love of gold and their blinding curiosity. He also did not understood why the newcomers knew about the ancient [[Dwarf deities|dwarf gods]] and why the newcomers knew about the [[Viperhands]] monsters.
