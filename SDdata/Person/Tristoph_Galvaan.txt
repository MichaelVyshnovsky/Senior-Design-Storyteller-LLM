==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Tristoph Galvaan had been practicing his craft for a number of years to no acclaim or recognition. Despite the lack of reputation, Tristoph was happy to have peace and quiet and quietly offered his leatherworking services to adventurers and defenders of Neverwinter.
