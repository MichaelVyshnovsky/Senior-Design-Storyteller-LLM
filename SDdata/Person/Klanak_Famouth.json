        "mainbody": "Eternal Flame Klanak Famouth was the high priest at the Burning House of Kossuth in Tyraturos, the most influential temple of Kossuth in Thay&mdashif not all of Faerûn&mdashuntil the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nKlanak Famouth was a man consumed by rage and an acute awareness of his own mortality, especially in his advanced age.\nHe was a powerful divine spellcaster\nKlanak was the chief mentor of Mythalanir, who would go on to become the Eternal Flame of the Flaming Brazier in Bezantur. However, this relationship evolved into that of an archrivalry and eventually into murderous hostility.\nHe was an ally of convenience with Mythrellaa, the Red Wizard Zulkir of Illusion.\nPrior to his appointment as Eternal Flame over the Burning House, Klanak was already an old man who had been the priest in charge of overseeing the temples slaves. He served as the leader and high priest of the Burning House for decades, and as of , he was the highest-ranking Kossuthan priest in Thay and arguably the most important in all of the Realms. However, his temple burned down sometime shortly before , leading his former subordinate and protégé, Mythalanir, to usurp his role as the most prominent member of the Kossuthan faith. \nKlanak suspected that Mythalanir had orchestrated the destruction of the Burning House, and so swore revenge. To achieve this, he abandoned the rebuilding of his temple to his junior subordinates and allied himself with Mythrellaa, an enemy of Mythalanirs ally, Aznar Thrul. The pair hatched a plot to manipulate adventurers into bypassing the many defenses of the FLaming Brazier and slaying Mythalanir."
