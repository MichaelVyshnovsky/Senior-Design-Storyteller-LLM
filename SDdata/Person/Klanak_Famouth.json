        "mainbody": "[[Eternal Flame]] '''Klanak Famouth''' was the [[high priest]] at the [[Burning House of Kossuth]] in [[Tyraturos]], the most influential temple of [[Kossuth]] in [[Thay]]&mdash;if not all of [[Faerûn]]&mdash;until the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Klanak Famouth was a man consumed by rage and an acute awareness of his own mortality, especially in his advanced age.",
        "Abilities": "He was a powerful [[divine spellcaster]]",
        "Relationships": "Klanak was the chief mentor of [[Mythalanir]], who would go on to become the Eternal Flame of the [[Flaming Brazier]] in [[Bezantur]]. However, this relationship evolved into that of an archrivalry and eventually into murderous hostility.\n\nHe was an ally of convenience with [[Mythrell'aa]], the [[Red Wizard]] [[Zulkir]] of [[Illusion]].",
        "History": "Prior to his appointment as Eternal Flame over the Burning House, Klanak was already an old man who had been the priest in charge of overseeing the temple's [[slave]]s. He served as the leader and high priest of the Burning House for decades, and as of {{Yearlink|1357}}, he was the highest-ranking [[Kossuthan]] priest in Thay and arguably the most important in all of the Realms. However, his temple burned down sometime shortly before {{Yearlink|1370}}, leading his former subordinate and protégé, Mythalanir, to usurp his role as the most prominent member of the Kossuthan faith. \n\nKlanak suspected that Mythalanir had orchestrated the destruction of the Burning House, and so swore revenge. To achieve this, he abandoned the rebuilding of his temple to his junior subordinates and allied himself with Mythrell'aa, an enemy of Mythalanir's ally, [[Aznar Thrul]]. The pair hatched a plot to manipulate [[adventurer]]s into bypassing the many defenses of the FLaming Brazier and slaying Mythalanir."
