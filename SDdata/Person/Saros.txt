'''Saros''' was the Lord of [[Turmish]] who rose to power in [[992 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|992}}, the Merchant Princes lost control of Turmish. An ambitious warlord and charismatic leader, Lord Saros, convinced the military forces of Turmish to support him as a potential ruler of the nation. Lord Saros proclaimed that the leadership of Turmish needed to be in the hands of the man who "knows what this country needs." Lord Saros, of course, became that man and took the throne. Under his leadership, Turmish rapidly became a naval force to be reckoned with. He sponsored construction of ports in the [[Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach]], namely in [[Hlath]] and [[Reth]], and forged an alliance with the city of [[Hlondeth]].

Lord Saros' legacy was Turmish becoming the guardian of the Vilhon's waterways and gaining security that allowed it to flourish. By the {{YearlinkName|1150}}, Turmish's population grew more than twice its size.
