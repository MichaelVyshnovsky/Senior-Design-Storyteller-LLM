He went with some dwarves to explore the Ironfist Stronghold, but they were stopped by bugbears.\nKhelgar Ironfist and the Kalach-Cha could have encountered Khulmar, but he would refuse their help, as he viewed Khelgar as deserting to pursue his own ideas. Khelgar and the Kalach-Cha could have explored the Stronghold themselves and found the Gloves of Ironfist, then returned to Khulmar to report their findings."
