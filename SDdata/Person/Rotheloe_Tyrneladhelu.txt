'''Rotheloe Tyrneladhelu''' was an inhabitant of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Rotheloe Tyrneladhelu was one of the wizards staying back in the hunt for [[Elminster Aumar]] in {{yearlink|241}}. [[Selgauth Cathdeiryn]] later related to the High Court Mage that though they'd prevailed, Rotheloe had completely lost his wits and could not stop crying.
