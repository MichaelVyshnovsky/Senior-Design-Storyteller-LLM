        "mainbody": "'''Fleabottom''' was a [[wererat]] and the leader of a cell of the [[Dead Rats]] gang in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Fleabottom decided to break the gang's agreement with the [[Nashers]] by kidnapping [[Gothwan Cooper]], the thief of the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'', in order to bargain his life for the crown. However, the Nashers abandoned Gothwan and ignored the issue, preferring to maintain the truce. Fleabottom kept Gothwan prisoner in the Dead Rats' hideout in the [[Blacklake Sewers]]. Ultimately, an [[adventurer]] recruited by Sergeant [[Knox]] to retrieve the crown infiltrated the lair and killed Fleabottom to free and question Gothwan."
