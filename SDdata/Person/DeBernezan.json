        "mainbody": "'''DeBernezan''' was a [[human]] resident of the [[Ten Towns]].",
        "Description": "He was described to be a short man with black hair.",
        "History": "In the 1350s [[DR]], the human lad betrayed the fighting people of Ten Towns for his own good. He ended up with [[Heafstaag]] and his [[barbarian]] kin, and gave them ways to defeat the Ten Towns that only one from the Ten Towns would know.\n\nDeBernezan was later slain, but not by the blade of a barbarian. In fact, the [[halfling]] [[Regis]] was forced to crush his skull with his [[mace]]."
