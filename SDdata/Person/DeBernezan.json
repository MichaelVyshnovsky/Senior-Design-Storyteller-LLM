        "mainbody": "DeBernezan was a human resident of the Ten Towns.\nHe was described to be a short man with black hair.\nIn the 1350s DR, the human lad betrayed the fighting people of Ten Towns for his own good. He ended up with Heafstaag and his barbarian kin, and gave them ways to defeat the Ten Towns that only one from the Ten Towns would know.\nDeBernezan was later slain, but not by the blade of a barbarian. In fact, the halfling Regis was forced to crush his skull with his mace."
