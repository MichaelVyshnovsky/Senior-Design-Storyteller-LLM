'''Xzar''' was an insane [[necromancer]] and a member of the [[Zhentarim]] who traveled the [[Sword Coast]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"I'm never quite so comfortable as when I'm at least six feet under."''|Xzar}}

==Personality==
Xzar was both intelligent and insane at the same time. He was quite unbalanced and would randomly spout gibberish at unpredictable moments; at one moment he could act like a frightened child while the next he may remark that he ate another person's liver paired with beans and a nice wine.

His treatment of others was usually coldly disdainful or derisive.

==Relationships==
The Zhentarim partnered Xzar with the [[halfling]] [[Montaron]], a pairing that was made against both their wishes. Xzar found 'Monty' to be quite insufferable, while he in turn thought Xzar completely mad. After some time however, it appeared as if the two had developed genuine care for one another.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Xzar and Montaron were tasked by the [[Zhentarim]] to investigate the [[iron crisis]] that plagued the [[Sword Coast]]. They traveled south along the [[Coast Way]] to the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Nashkel]].In the [[Baldur's Gate (novel)]], Xzar and Montaron rescue [[Abdel Adrian]] from a horde of [[gibberling]]s before joining him on his journey to the [[Friendly Arm Inn]] and [[Nashkel]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Xzar and Montaron had traveled to [[Athkatla]] to spy on the local group of [[Harpers]] led by [[Galvarey]]. At that time Xzar had employed a pair of apprentices, [[Prebek]] and [[Sanasha]]. The trio were conducting experiments involving the creation of horrific monsters.

Montaron was captured by the Harpers at some point and to Xzar's knowledge was taken to the local [[Galvarey estate|Harper Hold]]. While Xzar sought a means to rescue his friend, Montaron had in fact already been killed.<ref group="note"> In the same novel, Xzar and Montraon never make it to Athkatla, but are slain by [[Sarevok]] during the [[Iron Crisis]].
