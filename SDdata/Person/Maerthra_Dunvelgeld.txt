'''Maerthra Dunvelgeld''', more commonly known as '''Lady Monster''', was a monster breeder who resided on [[Tower March]] of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lady Monster was a tall and beautiful aging [[human]] woman. She had a cheerful demeanor and lush purring voice. Maerthra's most notable feature was her wild head of black hair, peppered with gray.

==Possessions==
Maerthra's home was located on the southfront Tower March, where it closed with [[Immar Street]]. The first thing visitors saw as they entered Lady Monster's parlor was a roomful of monster parts and trophies for sale. They included a wide variety of items such as antlered skulls, jarred tentacles, giant fangs, and other curios. Each item in Maerthra's collection was priced individually and heavily negotiated.

==Activities==
Maerthra's career was built around breeding and selling various exotic creatures. She often sought capable adventurers out, sending them up and down the [[Sword Coast North]] to capture living and "disassembled" monsters for her clients.

When more exotic living specimens were required, Lady Monster connected her clients with one of her many contacts who knew where to procure something like a living young [[gold dragon]].

==History==
In her youth, Lady Monster claimed to have been an adventurer who hailed from [[Chessenta]]. By the {{Yearlink|1479}}, Maerthra Dunvelgeld established her business and new home on Tower Marc. As of the {{Yearlink|1490}} and the decade that followed, Lady Monster still ran her business from the same base and was likely to remain active for 20 more years.

==Rumors & Legends==
*Waterdeep's rumor mill talked about [[doppelganger]], [[drow]], [[mind flayer]]s, and other strange late-night visitors to Lady Monster's parlor. Some especially preposterous telltales claimed that the woman's bedroom was guarded by a tamed [[grell]], while others insinuated Maerthra Dunvelgeld was in close relations with one of the [[Masked Lord]] of the City of Splendors and several heads of noble families.
