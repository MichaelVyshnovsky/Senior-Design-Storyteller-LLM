Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the [[mind flayer]]s in [[Faerûn]] shifted in balance. Teth'ka, loyal to her Kith'tak, was a warrior in training who was to become a sarth, leading her kin into battle. She and several of her kin ventured into the nearby [[shadow-cursed lands]], where they encountered a corrupted spirit of nature [[Thaniel]] who forced them to play games with him and his shadows and ended up killing Teth'ka and others."
