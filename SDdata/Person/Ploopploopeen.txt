Ploopploopeen was a kuo-toa archpriest and ruler of Sloobludop in the late 15 century DR.
Ploopploopeen was a good leader for his people, even tolerating occasional dissidents like Shuushar, but he was not forgiving of any who would destroy the peace of his community, even his daughter. He was also smart, capable of elaborating complex plans.
Ploopploopeen quietly ruled the village of Sloobludop on the Darklake as both their spiritual and temporal leader, until his daughter Bloppblippodd told him that she had been contacted by a new god, Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father (in truth, the demon lord Demogorgon), and began to spread her new religion among the kuo-toa. Soon, she had gathered so many followers to her that her father Ploopploopeen started to make plans to reclaim his position. He asked a party of adventurers who had escaped from drow slavers of Velkynvelve to help infiltrate Leemooggoogoons temple disguised as sacrifices to disrupt the upstart factions rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult.
Ploopploopeen and his son Glooglugogg, with some guards and the adventurers, went to Leemooggoogoons temple, telling Bloppblippodd that they had accepted her supremacy and offering the adventurers as sacrifices. She was pleased with her victory over her father and, after sacrificing the duergar Hemeth, she went to sacrifice the adventurers. At that time, the adventurers and Ploopploopeen and his warriors attacked her and her lieutenants. At this point, however, "Leemooggoogoon" rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present.
