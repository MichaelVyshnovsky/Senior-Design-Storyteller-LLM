'''Baba Lysaga''' was a [[hag]] who lived in [[Barovia]].
{{Quote|I am the mother of Strahd. Anyone who disputes this fact can rot.|Baba Lysaga.}}

==History==
Baba Lysaga was the midwife for Queen [[Ravenovia van Roeyen]], the mother of [[Strahd von Zarovich]].

Some time after the [[Berez]] was flooded and fully abandoned, its ruins became a home to Baba Lysaga who later on lived in a hut in the middle of the village.

''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|1491}}, Baba Lysaga with the help of the druids of Yester Hill stole a magic gemstone from the [[Wizards of Wines]] vineyard. She planned to use the gemstone as a bait for the wereravens protecting the vineyard.

==Possessions==
Lysaga had a number of [[scarecrow]] constructs at her disposal, which she used to harass the [[Martikov]] family. She was also known to fly around in the magic, hollowed-out skull of a [[hill giant]].

==Relationships==
Baba Lysaga believed she was the true mother of Strahd and continued to watch the deeds of Strahd from afar, although she had to leave [[Castle Ravenloft]].

Lysaga despised [[wereraven]]s, who were often members of the secret Strahd resistance group called the [[Keepers of the Feather]] and made it her mission to wipe them out.

She was known to be allied with the [[Barovian witches]] of Castle Ravenloft and the [[druid]]s of [[Yester Hill]], the latter of which sought to help her steal the gems of the Wizard of Wines winery.
