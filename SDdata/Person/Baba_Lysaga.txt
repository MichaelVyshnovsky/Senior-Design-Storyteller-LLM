Baba Lysaga was a hag who lived in Barovia.
Baba Lysaga was the midwife for Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen, the mother of Strahd von Zarovich.
Some time after the Berez was flooded and fully abandoned, its ruins became a home to Baba Lysaga who later on lived in a hut in the middle of the village.
Circa , Baba Lysaga with the help of the druids of Yester Hill stole a magic gemstone from the Wizards of Wines vineyard. She planned to use the gemstone as a bait for the wereravens protecting the vineyard.
Lysaga had a number of scarecrow constructs at her disposal, which she used to harass the Martikov family. She was also known to fly around in the magic, hollowed-out skull of a hill giant.
Baba Lysaga believed she was the true mother of Strahd and continued to watch the deeds of Strahd from afar, although she had to leave Castle Ravenloft.
Lysaga despised wereravens, who were often members of the secret Strahd resistance group called the Keepers of the Feather and made it her mission to wipe them out.
She was known to be allied with the Barovian witches of Castle Ravenloft and the druids of Yester Hill, the latter of which sought to help her steal the gems of the Wizard of Wines winery.
