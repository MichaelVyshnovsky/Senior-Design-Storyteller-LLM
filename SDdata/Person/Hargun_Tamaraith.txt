==History==
As of {{yearlink|1335}}, 22 years prior to {{yearlink|1357}}, Hargun and Fythuera's child, Narm, was born. They had been married for some time prior. While Narm was still a baby, they traveled to [[Triboar]] and then to [[Waterdeep]], up and down the [[Sword Coast]] in search of commerce opportunities. In {{yearlink|1346}}, 11 years prior to 1357 DR, they were slain in [[Baldur's Gate]] while in the crossfire of a duel between [[Kluennh Tzarr]] and [[Algarzel Halfcloak]]. Hargun's last act was to hurl Narm into the river, so that he would survive the fireball.
