        "mainbody": "'''Hogan Underwood''' was a kindly-looking, elderly [[halfling]], who was secretly a retired master [[thief]]. In {{yearlink|1356}}, at the time of Khalitarius' release, he was the owner of Happy Hogan's Igloo in the [[Oasis of the White Palm]], and sometimes a bartender during busy evenings.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|65}}",
        "Personality": "Hogan was suspicious of strangers, but loyal for life to his friends.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|67}}",
        "History": "Among the many aliases of Hogan Underwood were: Hogan the Happy, Hogan the Huckster, Shylo Slick, Aldo Chella, Rory the Ransacker, Negel Broos, and Sedgewick Paddington the Third. Shylo Slick, in particular, was an alias recognized by a great majority of thieves.\n\nBesides the bar, he owned the nearby stables. He had hired a stable boy,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|71-72}} a chef called [[Cookie]], and a bartender, a friendly [[Durpari]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|72}} Rose Underwood, his niece, was visiting him and bartended at his place.",
        "Possessions": "Hogan wore a very powerful ''[[cloak of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', and a ''[[ring of spell turning]]'', though the rings might fail to operate when a halfling used them. He also wielded an enchanted dagger and an intelligent short sword, ''[[Shylo's Slicer]]''.\n\nUnder his bed, he had a chest labeled with his own name. In it, he had 7.7 pounds of copper, 5 pounds of silver, and 1.8 pounds of gold.The contents are given by weight, as the 1st edition material employed coinage of different weight: 10 coins made a pound, rather than 50. To preserve edition neutrality, precious metal weights are employed instead.",
        "Abilities": "Hogan's agility was as good as it got for a human; it's possible that he had superhuman dexterity when he was younger. His thieving abilities were all but guaranteed to succeed, save for his ability to hear noise, climb walls, and read languages.",
        "Activities": "[[Tekuna Chand]] knew Hogan personally.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|14}} [[Zorath Blackblade]] used to drink at the bar, often bored.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|70}}",
        "Rumors": "For people he trusted, Hogan would volunteer the following during the time between Khalitarius' release and ultimate destruction:\nHe knew that Hassan knew how to pilot a sand sled.\nThe guildmaster of the sandvoyagers had not been seen for many days, although Hogan had received parchments with his signature, requesting libations.\nHe had observed that Corga Hazan was never seen before noon at his little place in the courtyard."
