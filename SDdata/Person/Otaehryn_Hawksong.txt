Otaehryn Hawksong was an Arms-Captain of the AkhVelahr in Myth Drannor in 650 DR.
Otaehryn born in 512 DR. At a very young age, he was chosen to become the AkhVelahrs second-in-command thanks to the loyalty of his troops and the trust of his mentor, Daratrine Xantrani (the commander of Semberholmes Moonshadows). This decision angered many sun elves of ancient Houses but Otaehryn was shielded by the favor of the coronal and the support of his troops.
Otaehryn was among the non-sun-elf clan heirs who in 666 DR, after the death of Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, tried to gain access to the Rule Tower but was killed together with the heirs of the Aunglor, Iliathor, Maerdrym, Nightstar, and Omberdawn clans.
Otaehryn was heir to the Hawksong clan despite born from an illicit liaison between his father and the wild elf mistress Axilya Laenye because he was the only son of the Clan Lord.
