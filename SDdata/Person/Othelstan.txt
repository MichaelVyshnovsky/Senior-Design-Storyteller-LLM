Captain Othelstan was a member of the Cult of the Dragon who supervised the Cult-controlled village of Parnast in the Greypeak Mountains.
The captain was a strong man with black skin.
In battle, Othelstan wore splint mail and fought with a shield and flail. If forced to use ranged attacks, he would throw a spear.
Othelstan controlled Parnast during the Tyranny of the Dragons when the mobile Skyreach Castle was just over the village. He briefly met with the Black Wyrmspeaker Rezmir when she arrived in the village in transit to the castle. He was likely defeated soon after by a band of adventures hired to stop the Cult.
