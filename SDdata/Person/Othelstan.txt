Captain '''Othelstan''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] who supervised the Cult-controlled village of [[Parnast]] in the [[Greypeak Mountains]].

==Description==
The captain was a strong man with black skin.

==Possessions==
In battle, Othelstan wore [[splint mail]] and fought with a [[shield]] and [[flail]]. If forced to use ranged attacks, he would throw a [[spear]].

==History==
Othelstan controlled Parnast during the [[Tyranny of Dragons|Tyranny of the Dragons]] when the mobile [[Skyreach Castle]] was just over the village. He briefly met with the Black Wyrmspeaker [[Rezmir]] when she arrived in the village in transit to the castle. He was likely defeated soon after by a band of adventures hired to stop the Cult.
