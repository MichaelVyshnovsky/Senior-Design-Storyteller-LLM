        "mainbody": "Two Llamas Running was a female tabaxi swashbuckler imprisoned by the evil barber Jooge Nopsmoth in Silverymoon.\nTwo Llamas had tan fur with gray stripes.\nBeing a tabaxi, Two Llamas could use her claws in combat, but preferred to fight wielding a dagger or rapier.\nIntrigued by her peculiar fur, Jooge Nopsmoth lured Two Llamas into his barbershop, intending to kill her. However, the tabaxi was not affected by the barbers magical mind-wiping blow-dryer. His modus operandi interrupted, Jooge opted instead for imprisoning Two Llamas in a thirty-foot-deep oubliette, with the hope of harvesting her remains for magical reagents.\nTwo Llamas may have been freed by a group of adventurers."
