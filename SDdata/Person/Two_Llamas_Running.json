        "mainbody": "'''Two Llamas Running''' was a female [[tabaxi]] [[swashbuckler]] imprisoned by the evil barber [[Jooge Nopsmoth]] in [[Silverymoon]].",
        "Description": "Two Llamas had tan fur with gray stripes.",
        "Abilities": "Being a tabaxi, Two Llamas could use her claws in combat, but preferred to fight wielding a [[dagger]] or [[rapier]].",
        "History": "Intrigued by her peculiar fur, Jooge Nopsmoth lured Two Llamas into his barbershop, intending to kill her. However, the tabaxi was not affected by the barber's magical mind-wiping blow-dryer. His modus operandi interrupted, Jooge opted instead for imprisoning Two Llamas in a thirty-foot-deep oubliette, with the hope of harvesting her remains for magical reagents.\n\nTwo Llamas may have been freed by a group of [[adventurer]]s."
