        "mainbody": "Tocka was a gnome holy slayer and member of the Gilded Palm in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nTocka was rescued by the future Sultana of Hiyal, Alurah bint Asrah, when her late-husband destroyed the Gilded Palm. Tocka became Alurahs personal servant and confidant. Those who knew of Tockas association with the Gilded Palm often pleaded to him about their problems to make them disappear.\nIt was rumored that Tocka played a part in the death of Alurahs husband, but nothing could be proven."
