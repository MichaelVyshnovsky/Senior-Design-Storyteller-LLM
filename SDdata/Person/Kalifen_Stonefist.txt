'''Kalifen Stonefist''' was a traveling [[monk]], [[cleric]], and a philosopher active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
His training gifted Kalifen with an introspective personality and a philosophical mind. He was a shy and donnish man.

==History==
By the age of eighteen, Kalifen had already spent a significant portion of his life traveling the world after departing his home, [[S'tung Monastery]] in the [[Hills of Quai]], in [[Bashan Do Province]] in [[T'u Lung]]. Throughout his life, Kalifen learned several types of martial arts, turning his body into a deadly weapon. One of the requirements of his faith, his religious duty, was roaming the world in order to learn the harsh realities of life.

Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, at the age of fifty-four, Kalifen Stonefist was among the ambitious adventurers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths.
