'''Merellan''' was a veteran amongst the [[Blades of the Old Man]]. On the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], {{yearlink|1374}}, he met up with [[Valmir]] at the door of the [[Tower of the Sun]] in [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]]. He relayed the situation, including that [[Talieth]] had been trapped by the vines, and that the vines were animate.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||38}}
