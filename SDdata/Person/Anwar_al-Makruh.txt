Anwar al-Makruh was a half-elven shair who lived in Medina al-Afyal on the island of Afyal in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Anwar was incredibly outspoken, a trait which had him falling into and out of favor with the Padishah on many occasions.
Anwar was the Arch-Vizier for the Padishah.
Anwar ran an impressive spy network within Afyal and beyond. His brilliant use of djinn spies ensured that his information was quick and accurate. It was rumored that any word uttered would be carried on the wind straight to Anwars ears.
