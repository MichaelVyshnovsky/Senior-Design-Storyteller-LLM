        "mainbody": "'''Kosef Demsk''' was a smuggler in the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Appearance": "He had keen features.",
        "Personality": "He was honorable enough to stand up for another who was not cheating. He believed Pavel had potential to be more than a librarian.",
        "Relationships": "Kosef Demsk had two lieutenants, [[Dor Stavask]] and [[Quendar Horn]]; the bravo [[Tana Farag]] was a fellow gangster who was loyal to him. He once struck an unlikely friendship with [[Pavel Shemov]], an initiate at the local [[Temple of the Dawn]].",
        "Possessions": "Kosef Demsk had an intrincately graven sword, the handle of which was set with a ruby; the weapon was known to be associated with him. His room near the [[Boot and Whistle]] was warded against many spells.",
        "History": "One summer, while at [[Rat's End]], Kosef vouched that [[Pavel Shemov]] had not cheated while throwing dice, and the two struck up a friendship.\n\nOne morning in 1359 DR or the 1360s DR<ref group=\"note\" name=\"NN\">The story is assumed to occur during the reign of Gareth Dragonsbane, as Pavel Shemov claims the king is \"a paladin of Ilmater\" and this happens prior to 1373. Gareth Dragonsbane rose to power in 1359 DR, with no other kings of Damara known to be such paladins of Ilmater. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the events of Silverfish occur during the 1360s DR. Kosef Demsk was arrested for the murder of [[Mivar Greyman]].{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|42}} Later, Pavel and Tana managed to strong-arm the magistrate [[Glar Chelenov]] into releasing him.{{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|48}}"
