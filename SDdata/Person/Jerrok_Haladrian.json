        "mainbody": "'''Jerrok Haladrian''' was a renowned [[bard]], musician, and a performer of [[Myth Drannor]] who build and enchanted his [[Jerrok's Concert Hall|Concert Hall]] but fell during the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Abilities": "Jerrok Haladrian was an accomplished spell-caster who masterfully enchanted the nodes of power in the concert hall's chorus stands, and later weaved a powerful protective spell in an attempt to save the Concert Hall from the invading [[Army of Darkness]].",
        "Possessions": "Jerrok was confident in the Concert Hall's defenses so this was where he kept his most valuable possessions such as his ''[[lyre of building]]''.",
        "History": "During the final stretch of the [[Weeping War]], Jerrok assembled the city's best surviving [[bards]] in his Concert Hall to weave a powerful protective spell to ward themselves off the invading Army of Darkness. As the bards' spell reached its crescendo, a powerful [[yugoloth]], [[Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke]], forced its way past the not-yet-solid barriers and started murdering the spell-singers. That caused the spell to backfire, petrifying all the creatures inside the hall.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], the statues inside the hall, including petrified Jerrok Haladrian himself, still held their note, loudly singing, even though the song was more reminiscent of a scream. Most treasure seekers that were brave enough to go inside Jerrok's Concert Hall faced a chance of going mad from the sound of arcane scream-singing and the possibility of being petrified."
