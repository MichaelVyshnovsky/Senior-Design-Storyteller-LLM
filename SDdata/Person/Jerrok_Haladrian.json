        "mainbody": "errok Haladrian was a renowned bard, musician, and a performer of Myth Drannor who build and enchanted his Concert Hall but fell during the Weeping War.\nJerrok Haladrian was an accomplished spell-caster who masterfully enchanted the nodes of power in the concert halls chorus stands, and later weaved a powerful protective spell in an attempt to save the Concert Hall from the invading Army of Darkness.\nJerrok was confident in the Concert Halls defenses so this was where he kept his most valuable possessions such as his lyre of building.\nDuring the final stretch of the Weeping War, Jerrok assembled the citys best surviving bards in his Concert Hall to weave a powerful protective spell to ward themselves off the invading Army of Darkness. As the bards spell reached its crescendo, a powerful yugoloth, Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke, forced its way past the not-yet-solid barriers and started murdering the spell-singers. That caused the spell to backfire, petrifying all the creatures inside the hall.\nIn 1369 DR, the statues inside the hall, including petrified Jerrok Haladrian himself, still held their note, loudly singing, even though the song was more reminiscent of a scream. Most treasure seekers that were brave enough to go inside Jerroks Concert Hall faced a chance of going mad from the sound of arcane scream-singing and the possibility of being petrified."
