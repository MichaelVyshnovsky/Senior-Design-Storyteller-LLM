He was responsible for the Arcane Brotherhoods operations in the western quadrant of Faerûn.\nBlaskar looked like a very ordinary, middle-aged man with a sturdy build and inexpensive clothes. But his looks were a tactic carefully crafted by Blaskar. He knew that looking ordinary gave him an advantage against an enemy that at first glance would not think him dangerous.\nBlaskar was a member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors of Waterdeep but was fired from the organization when his fellows discovered that he stole rare magical components for himself.\nSoon he become a mercenary wizard, known among smugglers and thieves for his complete amorality, willing to do anything for the right price. \nOne day he was employed by a group of smugglers to protect their ship from pirates. When Luskans pirates attacked the smugglers ship, Blaskar destroyed them all. Agents of the Brotherhood discovered that it was Blaskar who destroyed the pirates and approached him with an offer to join their ranks. Blaskar saw no reason to refuse, and accepted. \nBlaskar quickly become indispensable in the organization with his skill in the creation of magic artifacts. He quietly noticed that the Brotherhoods upper ranks destroyed themselves in civil war, leaving many positions empty, so it was no surprise when Arklem Greeth promoted him to the West Tower.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryMercenaries\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryMembers of the Arcane Brotherhood\nCategoryInhabitants of the Host Tower of the Arcane\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of Luskan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryMembers of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors\n75j26il02hbtdoqtjv3t3jh9j8cmfc9"
