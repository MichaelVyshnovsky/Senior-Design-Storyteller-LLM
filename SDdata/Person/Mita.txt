'''Mita''' was the [[raccoon]] [[familiar]] of [[No Ziar]], a notorious [[wu jen]] who dwelled in the [[Vorkani Mountains]] and in the settlement of [[Pan (town)|Pan]] in [[Koryo]] around [[1357 DR]].

Mita could swell to twice its natural size in a fight. It enjoyed eating fresh fish, namely the people that No Ziar transformed into fish.
