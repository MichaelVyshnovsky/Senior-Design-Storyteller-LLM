'''Argus Skeel''' was a [[vampire spawn]] in service to the [[necromancer]] [[Ularan Mortus]]. He spied for the [[Cult of Myrkul]] in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Skeel resided in the cellar of an abandoned hut on the outskirts of town, together with a horde of [[ghouls]] under his command. He frequently spied on the [[Stonehill Inn]]. Because of his sunlight hypersensitivity, Skeel almost never came out of hiding in daylight, and when he did, he covered his skin with heavy clothing to protect himself.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], following the attacks by the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the surrounding region, Argus Skeel came to Phandalin from the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. He pretended to be a prospector, but he was actually a spy for the [[Myrkul]] cultists.

At some point, a group of [[adventurers]] from [[Leilon]], who had previously thwarted the plans of the Myrkul followers, arrived in Phandalin to pick up supplies for Leilon. Before they could leave town, Skeel and his ghouls confronted them. At the same time, [[Velleen Firecrow]], a spy for the rivaling [[Cult of Talos]], confronted the adventurers with her [[kobold]]s, resulting in a three-sided battle.
