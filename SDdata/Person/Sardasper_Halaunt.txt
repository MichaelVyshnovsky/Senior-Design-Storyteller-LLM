'''Sardasper Halaunt''' was a noble of [[Cormyr]] in [[1487 DR]].

==Activities==
Sardasper was a noble and a businessman. He was known to hire the less-honorable adventuring parties to dispose of his [[Sembian]] rivals.

==History==
In 1487 DR, rumors said that in his mansion was hidden the fabled [[Lost Spell]]. Because of this, during a visit to the [[Dragon Rampant]] club in [[Suzail]], [[Manshoon]], [[Shaan]], and many other [[archmage]]s started a magic battle attempting to capture him.

The battle ruined his mind but he regained his senses once inside his mansion. However, a [[spellstorm]] hit the place, trapping all the archmages inside his house.
