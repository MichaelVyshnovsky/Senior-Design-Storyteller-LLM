Sardasper Halaunt was a noble of Cormyr in 1487 DR.
Sardasper was a noble and a businessman. He was known to hire the less-honorable adventuring parties to dispose of his Sembian rivals.
In 1487 DR, rumors said that in his mansion was hidden the fabled Lost Spell. Because of this, during a visit to the Dragon Rampant club in Suzail, Manshoon, Shaan, and many other archmages started a magic battle attempting to capture him.
The battle ruined his mind but he regained his senses once inside his mansion. However, a spellstorm hit the place, trapping all the archmages inside his house.
