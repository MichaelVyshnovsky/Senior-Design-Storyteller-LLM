Phandalyn was a paladin who lived in Baldurs Gate during the midâˆ’14 century DR.
Phandalyn was extremely judgmental. He would freely comment upon the moral outlook of passers-by. If Phandalyn sensed evilness in anyone, he would readily attack them.
He frequented a rather unremarkable inn found in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate.
Phandalyn owned and wielded a +1 enchanted spear.
