        "mainbody": "'''Stedd Whitehorn''' was a young boy [[Chosen]] and prophet of [[Lathander]] during the [[Second Sundering]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Stedd was chosen by Lathander to announce his return to the people of the [[Realms]]. Unfortunately, this attracted the ire of many factions that opposed this event.\n\nFirst, Stedd was captured by the [[Shadovar]] and imprisoned in a secret village in the [[Lost Peaks]], together with many other Chosen. He was freed from the camp by the [[Harpers]] and [[Farideh]].\n\nAfterward, in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Stedd was pursued by the Chosen of [[Umberlee]], [[Evendur Highcastle]] and the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. At last, Stedd fulfilled his mission of curing the leader of the [[Emerald Enclave]], [[Cindermoon]], from a [[Shar]]-induced-madness."
