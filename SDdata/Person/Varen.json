        "mainbody": "'''Varen''' was the leader of the [[Riders of Nesmé]] until [[1484 DR]].",
        "History": "Varen had been the Riders' leader from around [[1464 DR]] and was a powerful warrior.\n\nJust after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the young idealist [[Selinus]] accused Varen of managing a ring of horse thieves that stole Riders' horses, despite Selinus having no clear proof. This caused a schism among the Riders, but the accusation was true.",
        "Personality": "Varen was an able leader. However, the promise of wealth had twisted his mind and he agreed to join the horse thieves. He wanted to atone his sins but did not want to lose his reputation among his fellows.",
