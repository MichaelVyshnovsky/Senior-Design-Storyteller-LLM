        "Personality": "Nuial loved the city and, despite his position as a Scion, had no taste for getting into any adventures in the wilderness. He tended to get lost in his music and fellow bard [[Teseryne Truesilver]] considered him a bit vapid and touched in the head, but liked him nevertheless.",
        "Description": "His eyes were hazel and his hair was sandy blond. He wore a [[tunic]] that was powder blue and [[hose]] that were seafoam green. He played the [[lyre]] and was armed with a [[dagger]] at his belt. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Nuial bore the holy symbol of [[Mielikki]] upon his brow, glowing emerald."
