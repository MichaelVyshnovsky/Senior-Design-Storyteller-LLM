He tended to get lost in his music and fellow bard Teseryne Truesilver considered him a bit vapid and touched in the head, but liked him nevertheless.\nHis eyes were hazel and his hair was sandy blond. He wore a tunic that was powder blue and hose that were seafoam green. He played the lyre and was armed with a dagger at his belt. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Nuial bore the holy symbol of Mielikki upon his brow, glowing emerald."
