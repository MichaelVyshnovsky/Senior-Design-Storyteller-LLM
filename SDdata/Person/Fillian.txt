Fillian was an eccentric alcohol brewer and merchant, with his stall set up in Daggerfords River Quarter circa 1372 DR.
Fillian was often described as a skulking gnome, with eyes constantly darting around, in fear of something or someone.
Fillian was infamous for his extremely potent brews, and he often lied and exaggerated just to sell his brewed stock.
Fillians Brew was always in stock at the genomes stall and he sold it with a flare and a tale for only 30 gold coins.
Fillians stall was set up in Dagerfords River Quarter from where he was commonly seen pushing his wares to thirstily sailors and pirates circa 1372 DR. The gnome used herbs picked in the vicinity of the Boareskyr Bridge for his ungodly concoctions. During one such foraging expedition, Fillian encountered a hungry stone giant who was dead-set on eating the little gnome. The giant grabbed Fillian, getting ready to swallow him raw, but the gnome uncorked his strongest brew and pure down the stone giants maw. The giant instantly went comatose. Or so Fillian said. This adventure gave the eccentric gnome his main sales pitch, that his brew could bring down a giant and put hair on elfs chest.
