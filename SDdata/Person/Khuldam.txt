'''Khuldam''' the dwarf was a [[dwarf]] caravan driver in [[Aglarond]] as of {{yearlink|1375}}, alongside Ledroc and Corthandu. They joined [[Quent]]'s caravan from at least [[Telflamm]]{{cite book/Stardeep|82|8}} to [[Emmech]].{{cite book/Stardeep|124|11}} They refused a cup of [[Long Jing]] tea from [[Raidon Kane]], preferring to share a flask of something that smelled much stronger than tea.
