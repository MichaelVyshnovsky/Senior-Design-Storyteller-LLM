'''Bron''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] and [[paladin]] of [[Eldath]] and the Lord of [[Iriaebor]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He believed strongly in the city, feeling that if the in-fighting of his time were to stop, they could become a much greater power in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==History==
During [[1363 DR]], when [[Ravendas]] took over Iriaebor, Lord Bron was sent to the dungeons. After the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]] defeated Ravendas and the [[Shadowking]], Lord Bron was found in the dungeons, but one of the members of the Fellowship, [[Tyveris]], had become a well-known hero in Iriaebor by leading the charge in freeing the prisoners underneath the [[High Tower of Iriaebor]], so there was a disagreement on who should be the next lord, even though Tyveris didn't want that job. Bron proposed Tyveris take up a position as his advisor instead, helping him reestablish the city, so he agreed. Everybody in the city was thereby made happy.<ref>
