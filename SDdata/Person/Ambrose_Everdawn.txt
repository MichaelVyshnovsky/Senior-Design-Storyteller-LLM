Sir '''Ambrose Everdawn''' was a [[knight]] and devout follower of [[Kelemvor]] who patrolled the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
By [[1492 DR]]{{WDH-time}}, age had taken its toll on Sir Ambrose, and he was known for his grizzled demeanor.

==Activities==
Sir Ambrose worked for the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] on a night patrol of the City of the Dead.

He appeared unconcerned about the mystery of the ''[[driftglobe]]s'' that drifted from the inhabited areas of Waterdeep during the night into the City of the Dead, only to return to the city in the morning.

==History==
In 1492 DR{{WDH-time}}, Sir Ambrose volunteered to help the City Guard to catch a [[necromancer]] who was stealing bones from the City of the Dead and animating them as [[skeleton]]s.
