Sir Ambrose Everdawn was a knight and devout follower of Kelemvor who patrolled the City of the Dead of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
By 1492 DR, age had taken its toll on Sir Ambrose, and he was known for his grizzled demeanor.
Sir Ambrose worked for the City Guard on a night patrol of the City of the Dead.
He appeared unconcerned about the mystery of the driftglobes that drifted from the inhabited areas of Waterdeep during the night into the City of the Dead, only to return to the city in the morning.
In 1492 DR, Sir Ambrose volunteered to help the City Guard to catch a necromancer who was stealing bones from the City of the Dead and animating them as skeletons.
