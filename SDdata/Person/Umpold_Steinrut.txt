'''Umpold Steinrut''', mostly known as '''Grumpold''', was a [[dwarf]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
Grumpold was a regular customer at the [[Yawning Portal]] together with his brother [[Angus Steinrut]], where they ate and drank. They managed a booth together and very often also lived inside it.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Grumpold was mourning the disappearance of Angus. His brother had disappeared after an evening when they were both heavily drunk. Angus said he was employed by the [[Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild]] and noticed something strange. The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] declared Angus dead but Umpold did not believe it.
