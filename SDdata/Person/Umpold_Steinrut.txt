Grumpold was a regular customer at the Yawning Portal together with his brother Angus Steinrut, where they ate and drank. They managed a booth together and very often also lived inside it.
In 1479 DR, Grumpold was mourning the disappearance of Angus. His brother had disappeared after an evening when they were both heavily drunk. Angus said he was employed by the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild and noticed something strange. The City Watch declared Angus dead but Umpold did not believe it.
