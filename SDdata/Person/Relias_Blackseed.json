        "mainbody": "'''Relias Blackseed''' was a [[halfling]] master maker of [[musical instruments]] who lived circa early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Relias' renown came from his creation of the ''[[Cittern of War]]''. The instrument was blessed and [[enchanted]] by the [[cleric]]s of the [[Church of Arvoreen]], making it a truly remarkable magic item. Despite the ''Cittern of War'' being masterfully crafted, Relias did not create it for personal use. It was sold to the [[bard]] named [[Gallow Deely]], who used the [[cittern]] to compose many a song about adventurers and their heroic deeds."
