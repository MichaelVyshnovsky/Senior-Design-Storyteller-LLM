Shield was a merchant from the city of Everlund in Silver Marches in the 14th century DR.
Shield partnered with six other merchants—Alvund of Ormpetarr, Chond of Calaunt, Dzunn of Sheirtalar, Jhasso of Baldurs Gate, Nammna of Milvarune, and Pomphur of Almraiven—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Shields own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Shield and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
