'''Shield''' was a merchant from the city of [[Everlund]] in [[Silver Marches]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

Shield partnered with six other merchants—[[Alvund]] of [[Ormpetarr]], [[Chond]] of [[Calaunt]], [[Dzunn]] of [[Sheirtalar]], [[Jhasso]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Nammna]] of [[Milvarune]], and [[Pomphur]] of [[Almraiven]]—to form the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]]. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Shield's own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the [[coster]].

Shield and the Seven Suns were in business by [[1358 DR]], and still going by [[1374 DR]].
