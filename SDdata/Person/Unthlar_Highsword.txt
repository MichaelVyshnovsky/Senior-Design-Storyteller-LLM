'''Unthlar Highsword''' was a [[Zhentilar]] veteran in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
A veteran [[Zhentilar]], he could throw knives quite well.

==Possessions==
He wielded a "deathfang" [[dagger]], which was extremely [[poison]]ous.

==History==
In the fight at [[Irondrake Rock]] between [[Shandril Shessair]] and the [[Zhentarim]] forces of [[Gathlarue]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Unthlar Highsword hurled his deathfang at the [[spellfire]] wielder after the death of Gathlarue. His throw was parried by [[Mirt]]; moments later, [[Narm Tamaraith]]'s strongest [[spell]] blew up the top half of his body, slaying him instantly.
