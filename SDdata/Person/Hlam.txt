Prior Hlam () was a human monk and priest of Tyr who lived in Neverwinter in 1374 DR and in Waterdeep in 1492 DR.
Hlam was a staunch ally of the Order of the Gauntlet. The Blackstaff Vajra Safahr often sent members of Force Grey to him for advice. Hlam and the gold dragon Aurinax were friends and spoke to each other regularly.
Prior Hlam assisted Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar as he presided over the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter. Hlams duties included training those who worshiped Tyr in both the fields of justice and marshal ability.
In the late 15 century DR, Hlam lived in a cave on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep. As grand-master of the Order of the Even-Handed, he occasionally took up prospective students, who typically did not return for a second session of training.
