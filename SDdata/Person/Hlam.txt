'''Prior Hlam''' ({{Pronounce|huh|LAWM|refs=}}) was a [[human]] [[monk]] and priest of [[Tyr]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in [[1374 DR]] and in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1492 DR]].{{WDH-time}}

==Relationships==
Hlam was a staunch ally of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]. The [[Blackstaff]] [[Vajra Safahr]] often sent members of [[Force Grey]] to him for advice. Hlam and the [[gold dragon]] [[Aurinax]] were friends and spoke to each other regularly.

==History==
Prior Hlam assisted [[Oleff Uskar|Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar]] as he presided over the [[Hall of Justice]] in Neverwinter. Hlam's duties included training those who worshiped Tyr in both the fields of justice and marshal ability.<ref name="VoloN-p133" >

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Hlam lived in a cave on the slopes of [[Mount Waterdeep]]. As grand-master of the [[Order of the Even-Handed]], he occasionally took up prospective students, who typically did not return for a second session of training.
