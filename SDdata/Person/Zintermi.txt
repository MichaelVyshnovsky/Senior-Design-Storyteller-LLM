'''Zintermi''' was a scholar and a [[cleric]] of the [[House of Oghma]] from [[Suzail]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Grant me the knowledge I seek, great Oghma. For I have sought truth and recorded it in your name, bound the past for all to study and captured the fleeting lives of great men on parchment. Allow me the blessing of understanding, that I may exalt it in the transient world of mortals, that I may show others the light of reason...''|Zintermi}}

==Description==
Zintermi was a green-eyed brown-skinned man.

==Personality==
A devotee of [[Oghma]], Zintermi possessed troves of knowledge on religion, history, and culture. He was highly respected in Suzail, he remained undisturbed of harassed by crowds bumping into him, zealous merchants, town criers, and street urchins.

Zintermi was known for performing all tasks, even the most mundane ones, methodically and gracefully. He often talked in a pedantic manner, a habit he acquired from years of being a teacher.

==Abilities==
Zintermi also had access to ''[[divine]]'' spells, one of such was a rare in the pre--[[Second Sundering]] world ''divine'' version of ''[[identify]]''.

==Relationships==
Zintermi was a friend, confidant, and a teacher of a [[Harper]] agent and adventurer [[Artus Cimber]], meeting him when the hero-to-be entered the House of Oghma to study as a youth. Two men shared a deep respect for each other but enjoyed playful teasings.

==History==
Zintermi was an established teacher and a scholar from the House of Oghma ''circa'' [[1340 DR]] when Artus Cimber joined the school as a student. Zintermi's teaching of history and culture of [[Faer√ªn]] were the main inspiration for Artus' rich and long career.

''Circa'' [[1368 DR]], Zintermi assisted his old friend Artus in investigating a murder in the guildhall of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]], clearing the fiendish butler's, [[Uther (individual)|Uther]]'s name. During the investigation, Zintermi offered Artus his wise council, as well as his divine magical skills, preparing a ritual and summoning the Scribe of the Dead, [[Jergal]].

In [[1362 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} Zintermi once again answered his old friend's call for aid. On his recent expedition to the [[Stonelands]], Artus Cimber encountered a mysterious [[Mulhorand]]i artifact that attached itself to the adventurer, and he was worried the item was ''[[curse]]d''. The duo sat down in [[Suzail]]'s [[Black Rat]] tavern to use Zintermi's magic to identify the item. In the prices, the scholar of Oghma unleashed the artifact's dweller, a strange four-armed spirit, bound to protect his owner by any means. [[Skuld (phantom)|Skuld]], the guardian spirit could not be removed, and Artus was stuck with the artifact. In the end, Zintermi recommended his friend to search for [[Phyrra al-Quim]] of [[Tantras]] for her knowledge of rare Mulhorandi magic.
