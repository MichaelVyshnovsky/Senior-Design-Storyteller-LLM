        "mainbody": "Rassendyll Uoumdolphin was the High Blade of Mulmaster, ruling the city with cunning schemes.\nRassendyll was over 6 (1.8 m) tall with gray hair and a weathered face. He was in good shape for a man of his age.\nRassendyll was the twin brother of Selfaril.\nPersonally protected by Thurndan Tallwand and the rest of the Brotherhood of the Cloak, Rassendyll also relied on hiring others within his realm of influence, such as the assassin Branislav Semyon whom he used to remove anyone who might challenge his power.\nSelfaril was unable to risk keeping Rassendyll within the city, yet could not bring it upon himself to kill his brother. Instead he \"promoted\" the lesser son to the role of an ambassador to the city of Waterdeep, while in reality, the appointment was more of an exile.\nIn 1368 DR, Rassendyll seized power by removing his brother from office and replacing him. The removal of Selfaril had been devised by Fzoul Chembryl in a bid to gain control over Mulmaster. The story wen that Rassendyll was in \"exile\" at this time, assigned to a diplomatic post in Waterdeep. Selfarils soul was trapped in a gem in the hilt of his sword.\nRassendyll made an important change in policy after assuming control, making an alliance with the Zhentarim."
