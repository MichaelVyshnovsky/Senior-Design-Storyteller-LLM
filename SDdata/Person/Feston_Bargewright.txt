'''Feston Bargewright''' was an innkeeper and the founder of the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] within the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Once, he was the proprietor of a simple wayside inn standing alone atop a hill beside the ford. However, after numerous attacks from bandits and brigands, Feston elected to fortify the hill. This feat was accomplished with the help of several [[Waterdhavian]] merchants whom Feston had encouraged to join him to share the costs. Bargewright Inn was well-established by [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Feston owned and operated [[the Bargewright Inn]] itself. The Bargewright Inn sold a chilled green [[wine]] from [[Mintarn]]; given that it was an acquired taste, [[Volothamp Geddarm]] suspected Feston stocked it because he had a taste for it.

He also chaired the Council of Directors that served as the local government.

==Relationships==
His brother [[Aldon Bargewright]], was a [[ranger]] who led the local militia and worked as the stablemaster. By [[1370 DR]], Aldon had succeeded Feston as chairman of the Council of Directors.

A descendant and namesake, [[Feston Bargewright (descendent)|Feston Bargewright]], was innkeeper around [[1486 DR]].{{Cite dragon/430/The Harpers of Waterdeep|37}}
