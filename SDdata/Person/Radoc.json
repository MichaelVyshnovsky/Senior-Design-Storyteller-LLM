        "mainbody": "'''Radoc''', also known as '''\"The One\"''' and '''Doc of New Empyrea''', was a powerful [[archmage]] and [[cleric]] from another world dwelling in the [[Star Mounts]] deep in the [[High Forest]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was a mysterious and charismatic figure.\n\nHis faith was that of Tangg, an other-planar [[deity|power]].",
        "Description": "He was an old man. On his forehead, he had a glowing sigil, said to have been put there by the [[titan]] Sylla. It could be seen at all times, whatever make-up, disguise, or magic was used to hide it.",
        "History": "For reasons unknown, Doc was exiled from another [[Prime Material plane]], called New Empyrea, to the world of [[Toril]]. There, he adopted the name \"Radoc\".\n\nRadoc's goal was to return to his home plane and become the master of New Empyrea. Over the course of nearly twenty years, he built a power base in the remote Star Mounts, using tribes of [[mongrelmen]] for muscle while purchasing all of the [[mithril]] that the [[orc]]s of the [[Spine of the World]] could mine. Over time, he had amassed almost 75 mongrelmen, organizing them into a significant force in the High Forest, Outsiders had little idea what he did in the Star Mounts.\n\nIn [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Radoc aided victims of an [[orc]] raid and took them to [[Loudwater]], where he was seen as a great healer and cleric and he made allies there. Radoc declined to answer any questions and bought some supplies in exchange for clear, sparkling crystals before he departed.\n\nIn the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Radoc and his gathered forces were last seen leaving the Star Mounts, as rumors circulated that he had finally obtained enough power to transport them to an unknown destination. Rumors continued to circulate regarding his whereabouts, with some saying he had gone to the [[Fallen Lands]] to gather more followers and others speculating that they had all died on a battlefield on another [[plane]]. No-one knew where they were, only that they were no longer in the High Forest.''The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier'', \"The Wilderness\", page 52, says Radoc and his mongrelman \"disappeared without anyone's knowledge... over ten years ago\" from [[1370 DR]], that is, before [[1360 DR]]. However, page 58 contradicts this twice over by having them \"reported leaving the Star Mounts in the summer of 1366\". By [[1370 DR]], their fate remained unknown, and but a few mongrelmen remained in the forest.\n\nHis true fate was known only to the inhabitants of [[Hellgate Keep]] - having heard about the death of the Keep's ruler, Radoc had decided to lead his monstrous army out of the Fallen Lands and on an assault against the [[demon]]-infested fortress in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. His forces made significant headway, tearing through the demons and their [[undead]] minions and damaging the main gates and walls. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but finally the demons tore and hurled chunks of masonry off their battlements, crushing both Radoc and his [[siege engine]]s. The remaining forces of the mad wizard fled the battlefield, scattering back into the Fallen Lands and into the [[Far Forest]] and [[Nether Mountains]], while the deepspawn remained in Hellgate Keep's Deep Tunnels.",
        "Relationships": "He had no known enemies. In fact, Radoc considered [[Grintharke]], the former [[balor]] ruler of Hellgate Keep, to be one of his great foes.",
        "Possessions": "Radoc was known to wear ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[cloak of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'', and a ''[[ring of protection]]''. He fought with a ''+4 [[mace]]'' that doubled as a ''[[wand of lightning bolts]]''."
