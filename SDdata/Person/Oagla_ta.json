Both women were bigger, stronger, and much more kind-hearted than most males of their races, Nyzeil, among duergar, and Oaglata, among half-orcs. The couple traveled to the city of Silverymoon, where they became targets of harassment and bigotry from the towns watch. Sferia Ranul, a kindly drow Silverstar of Selûne, witnessed the treatment and got involved, sheltering the couple from prejudice. Grateful and realizing they shared faith and values, Nyzeil and Oaglata joined Sferia Ranuls adventure troupe  - the Sisters of the Blood Moon.\nOaglata and her partner were the groups muscles, being more formidable than most males in battle. One fateful night, the trip encountered a goblin ambush in a forest outside Silverymoon. Serendipitously, three adventuring heroes came along the site of the battle and rushed to their aid. The heroes were a rock gnome rogue Kylei Shadowhand, her twin sister wizard Hylei, and a ranger Half-elf Nevae Quar. The group dispatched bandits with ease, battling in synch, Sferia became enamored with the new allies battle prowess and convinced them to join her adventuring band.\nIn 1310 DR, Sferia Ranul received a letter – a plea for help from the town of Targos in Icewind Dale. Despite the promise of gold and fame, Sferia led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help."
