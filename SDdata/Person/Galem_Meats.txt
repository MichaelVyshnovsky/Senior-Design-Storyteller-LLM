Galem Meats was a smuggler who worked with the infamous Guild in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Meats was a mountainous grey-skinned half-orc with long wavy lush hair. He was dressed in a simple breastplate atop bright green cloth, and carried a massive two-handed axe.
In the , Jezzy worked as a muscle for a gruff hin smuggler named Big Huido, transporting weapons, drugs, and firewine into Baldurs Gate. The shipments were well defended by Galem and the rest of the crew – all were released into the hands of the members of the Guild only. One such shipment during the Absolute crisis was a chest containing essence of ether, dream mist, silkroot, and terazul – all illegal substances in the city.
