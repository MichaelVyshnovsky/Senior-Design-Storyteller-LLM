'''Sirith''' was a [[bird]]<ref group="note">Sirith was presumably a [[blue jay]] like [[Topaz (bird)|Topaz]] and [[Tinqmiaq]]. that nested in the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sirith was one of the birds trained and cared for by [[Nettie]]. He was used as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_post mail bird].

In the late 15{{th}} century, Sirith passed away and was buried under a stone. A [[tenday]] later, however, the dead body of Sirith delivered [[Apikusis]] a letter from the [[hag]] [[Ethel]], who had infiltrated the Emerald Grove in [[human]] disguise and dug up the bird's remains. The letter served as both a threat and an invitation for those who would dare to enter the [[Riverside Teahouse|hag's lair]].

According to the ''Correspondence Report'', Apikusis buried the bird once more, choosing a heavier stone to cover the grave.
