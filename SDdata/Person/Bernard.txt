Bernard was the innkeep at the Copper Coronet in Athkatla in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Bernard was a rather rotund individual.
In addition to offering rooms for rent and drinks on tap, Bernard had a number of magical items for sale at the Copper Coronet.
Bernard was an ally of several members of the Harpers, among them the druid Jaheira and her fellow agent Belgrade. He was somewhat wary of the Athkatlan Harpers who operated out of the Galvarey estate near the docks.
