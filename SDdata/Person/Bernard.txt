In addition to offering rooms for rent and drinks on tap, Bernard had a number of [[magic]]al items for sale at the Copper Coronet.

==Relationships==
Bernard was an ally of several members of the [[Harpers]], among them the [[druid]] [[Jaheira]] and her fellow agent [[Belgrade]]. He was somewhat wary of the Athkatlan Harpers who operated out of the [[Galvarey estate]] near the docks.
