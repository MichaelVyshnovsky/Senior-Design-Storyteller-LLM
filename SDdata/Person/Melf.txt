Melf was a male elf archmage and spell-inventor. Both his work and spells were known by many inhabitants of the Realms.
Melf developed two spells that were common in the Realms Melfs acid arrow and Melfs minute meteors.
As of the 15 century DR, Melf was over 200 years old.
Though he was opinionated and vain, Melf dedicated much of his life to fighting the forces of evil.
Melf fought with and owned a magical spear and shield, a cloak of illusions, elven chainmail, a spellbook, and an exploding meteor.
In 1364 DR, Robillard of the Sea Sprite and Harkle Harpell of Longsaddle engaged in a spellcasting competition. When Harkle took out the material components for Melfs acid arrow, Robillard recognized the spell instantly, and said that he knew Melf. Harkle was surprised and asked his age, and Robillard clarified that he didnt know him personally, but was familiar with his work. Robillard then cast Melfs minute meteors and Harkle commented "Better Melf".
In the late 15 century DR, Melf joined some noted champions of the Realms as they journeyed through the many places of Faer√ªn.
