'''Mizferac''' was a [[glabrezu]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Mizferac was described as stupid by the [[imp]] who'd provided his name to Cadderly.

==History==
Mizferac was summoned by Cadderly in the {{YearlinkName|1366}} to help determine the whereabouts of [[Jarlaxle]]. He did so on a regular basis for a [[tenday]] until he brought news of Jarlaxle, [[Artemis Entreri]], and [[Crenshinibon]] coming to see the priest. Immediately after, he was banished for a hundred years by Cadderly after threatening Cadderly's family.

However, he was later summoned again by Cadderly, rescinding the banishment.<ref>
