        "mainbody": "Audrec SeTourne was a duelist from Lantan who was in Mulmaster.\nThe gladiator was known for his evil nature. In fights, Audrec would backstab his fellow gladiators just to win the tournament gold, and he would kill innocents under the pretense of a \"duel of honor\".\nIn 1491 DR, Audrec fought in the gladiator matches held in the Boar Pit of the Black Blade and Bloody Boar tavern. At the same time, he extorted money from a noble of Mulmaster. However, his victim was an ally of the Zhentarim, who sent their agent Saerol Danonbryl to kill Audrec during one of the matches using a poison known as pale tincture."
