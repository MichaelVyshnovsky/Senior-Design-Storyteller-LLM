Pomphur was a merchant from the city of Almraiven in Calimshan in the 14th century DR.
Pomphur partnered with six other merchants—Alvund of Ormpetarr, Chond of Calaunt, Dzunn of Sheirtalar, Jhasso of Baldurs Gate, Nammna of Milvarune, and Shield of Everlund—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Pomphurs own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Pomphur and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
