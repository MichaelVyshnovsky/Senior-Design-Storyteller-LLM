Uthagrimnoshaarl, also known as the Dire Dragon, was a shadow dracolich who acted as the guardian of the Well of Dragons in Skull Gorge.
Uthagrimnoshaarl was a special kind of undead, a dracolich.
Around 1370 DR, the Cult of the Dragon approached him with a proposal of an alliance The Cults wizards would release the Dire Dragon from his role of guardian if, in exchange, he would permit the Cult to build a fortress inside the Well. 
He annihilated the village of Ladydove, with only Yajandra Dlathaeros house surviving.
Sometime after 1370 DR he was destroyed.
