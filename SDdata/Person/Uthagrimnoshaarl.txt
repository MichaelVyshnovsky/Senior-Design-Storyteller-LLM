'''Uthagrimnoshaarl''', also known as the '''Dire Dragon''', was a [[shadow dragon|shadow]] [[dracolich]] who acted as the guardian of the [[Well of Dragons]] in [[Skull Gorge]].

==Description==
Uthagrimnoshaarl was a special kind of [[undead]], a dracolich.

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] approached him with a proposal of an alliance: The Cult's [[wizard]]s would release the Dire Dragon from his role of guardian if, in exchange, he would permit the Cult to build a fortress inside the Well. 

He annihilated the village of [[Ladydove]], with only [[Yajandra Dlathaero]]'s house surviving.

Sometime after [[1370 DR]] he was destroyed.
