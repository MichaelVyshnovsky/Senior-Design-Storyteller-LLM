        "mainbody": "| class\nLady Quallem was a female human and once the head of the Quallem family before she arose as a ghost in the Dordrien crypts.\nLady Quallem had a regal look about her and dressed in gowns both elegant and long.\nAlthough not any great threat in life, she became quite a potent ghost in undeath. Any who viewed her were open to her horrific appearance that could weaken even hardy heroes. In addition, as a ghost, Lady Quallem had the power to possess and animate a statue bearing her likeness in her tomb, which she could put to crushing affect against would-be tomb robbers.\nSome time during the rule of Dordrien before its fall in , Lady Quallem rose to prominence as the head of the Quallem family. Eventually, she died and her body was interred in the family crypts amid the Dagger Hills along with her eccentric son, a noted wizard. However, Lady Quallem later rose as a restless spirit, prevented from passing on to the afterlife until her last descendant was buried beside her. Even as late as 1372 DR, her crypt had not been broken into thanks to a rather potent death-dealing spell trap.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryGhosts\nCategoryInhabitants of Dordrien\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dagger Hills\nCategoryInhabitants of Daggerdale\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dalelands\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryMembers of the Quallem family\nCategoryNobles\nCategoryAristocrats\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nkkd5uyq25b0jaz1w4k2abddmcsik2yr"
