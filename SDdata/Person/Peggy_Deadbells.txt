'''Peggy Deadbells''' was a [[night hag]] and a member of the [[Sewn Sisters]]. She operated in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], harvesting souls for the [[atropal]].

==Description==
Peggy Deadbells wore a necklace of children's teeth and fingers, and a bag made from [[gnome]] skin around her neck. She walked around on a wooden [[Prosthetic|peg leg]]. Whenever she laughed, yellow gas poured out of her ears and nose.

==Possessions==
Contained in her gnome skin pouch, Peggy Deadbells had a [[heartstone]] and five black marbles. Her [[soul bag]] was tied to her waist.

==Relationships==
Peggy Deadbells worked with [[Widow Groat]] and [[Baggy Nanna]] to complete the Sewn Sisters coven. She also was tasked with guarding and taking care of the ''[[Soulmonger]]'' in the lowest levels of the Tomb of the Nine Gods under a bargain with [[Acererak]].

==History==
She and the Sewn Sisters had a feared reputation in the [[lower planes]] before making a deal with the [[demilich]], Acererak.
