Peggy Deadbells was a night hag and a member of the Sewn Sisters. She operated in the Tomb of the Nine Gods in the late 15 century DR, harvesting souls for the atropal.
Peggy Deadbells wore a necklace of childrens teeth and fingers, and a bag made from gnome skin around her neck. She walked around on a wooden peg leg. Whenever she laughed, yellow gas poured out of her ears and nose.
Contained in her gnome skin pouch, Peggy Deadbells had a heartstone and five black marbles. Her soul bag was tied to her waist.
Peggy Deadbells worked with Widow Groat and Baggy Nanna to complete the Sewn Sisters coven. She also was tasked with guarding and taking care of the Soulmonger in the lowest levels of the Tomb of the Nine Gods under a bargain with Acererak.
She and the Sewn Sisters had a feared reputation in the lower planes before making a deal with the demilich, Acererak.
