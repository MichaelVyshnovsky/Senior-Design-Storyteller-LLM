Netheril was the name used by a wizard of Freedale town in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was old and bearded.
He was stuck-up, and really did not care for getting pushed around by anyone.
High Wizard Netheril was quite powerful, almost certainly far more than the adventurers he employed.
His abode was a tower in Freedale where he kept no end of trinkets and books. Sometimes, he carried some minor magic he could sell, such as a spell scroll, a dozen enchanted arrows, or a potion of giant strength, speed, invisibility, or fire resistance.
He was willing to identify magical devices for a fee and sometimes he sold enchanted wares, but did not offer many other services.
The man was attended by three warriors his manservant Major Domo, and the guards Fortu, and Deval. The elf Taran Goldenstar was his apprentice.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, High Mage Netherils apprentice Taran Goldenstar left for the Tomb of Damara, seeking an orb that an ogre was close to obtaining. After two days, Taran had not returned the wizard had the town crier call for adventurers in Freedale. He later recruited a party, most likely made up of Slinker, Delvar Ironfist, Lordan the Pure, Morganth the Mysterious, Beldar the Brave, and Silverleaf Halfmoon to find his apprentice Taran Goldenstar in the Tomb of Damara. He intended to pay 100 gold pieces, but may have paid up to twice that.
After the adventurers rescued Taran, if they returned to town, Netheril appealed to their sense of justice to stop the ogre Bonegnasher, who was close to attaining the orb of dragonkind, according to the elfs report. If the adventurers accepted, and returned with the orb, then Netheril almost certainly destroyed it.
To the adventurers, Netheril was too mighty in magic for any real contest. However, to Taran, he was too old to adventure.
