'''Netheril''' was the name used by a [[wizard]] of [[Freedale]] town in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was old and bearded.

==Personality==
He was stuck-up, and really did not care for getting pushed around by anyone.

==Abilities==
High Wizard Netheril was quite powerful, almost certainly far more than the adventurers he employed.

==Possessions==
His abode was a tower in [[Freedale]] where he kept no end of trinkets and books. Sometimes, he carried some minor magic he could sell, such as a ''[[spell scroll]]'', a dozen [[enchanted]] arrows, or a potion of ''[[potion of giant strength|giant strength]]'', ''[[potion of speed|speed]]'', ''[[potion of invisibility|invisibility]]'', or ''[[potion of fire resistance|fire resistance]]''.

==Activities==
He was willing to ''[[identify]]'' magical devices for a fee and sometimes he sold [[enchanted]] wares, but did not offer many other services.

==Relationships==
The man was attended by three warriors: his manservant [[Major Domo (Freedale)|Major Domo]], and the guards [[Fortu]], and [[Deval]]. The elf [[Taran Goldenstar]] was his apprentice.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], High Mage Netheril's apprentice Taran Goldenstar left for the [[Tomb of Damara]], seeking an ''orb'' that an [[ogre]] was close to obtaining. After two days, Taran had not returned; the wizard had the town crier call for adventurers in Freedale. He later recruited a party, most likely made up of [[Slinker]], [[Delvar Ironfist]], [[Lordan]] the Pure, [[Morganth]] the Mysterious, [[Beldar]] the Brave, and [[Silverleaf Halfmoon]] to find his apprentice Taran Goldenstar in the Tomb of Damara. He intended to pay 100 [[gold pieces]], but may have paid up to twice that.

After the adventurers rescued Taran, if they returned to town, Netheril appealed to their sense of justice to stop the ogre [[Bonegnasher]], who was close to attaining the ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'', according to the elf's report. If the adventurers accepted, and returned with the ''orb'', then Netheril almost certainly destroyed it.

==Rumors & Legends==
To the adventurers, Netheril was too mighty in magic for any real contest. However, to Taran, he was too old to adventure.
