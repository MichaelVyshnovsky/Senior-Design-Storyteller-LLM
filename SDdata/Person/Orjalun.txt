'''Orjalun''' was the kind and just High Mage of [[Silverymoon]] during the city's early days. He was one of the most polite and cultured [[wizard]]s ever known. Prior to being High Mage, he was Keeper of the [[Vault of the Sages]].<ref name=GHR>  

==History==
===Disappearance===
When Orjalun left his post, the city was entrusted to his treacherous apprentice. It was speculated that he sought his death or a quiet life of solitude. While he was believed to be dead, there were rumors of a mage befitting Orjalun's characteristics seeking a tome called the ''[[Arbatel]]''.
