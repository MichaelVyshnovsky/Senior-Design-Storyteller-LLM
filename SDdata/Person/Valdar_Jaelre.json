        "mainbody": "'''Valdar Jaelre''' was a [[drow]] priest of [[Vhaeraun]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Valdar was born to [[House Jaelre]] when it was still in [[Menzoberranzan]].\n\nValdar was one of the [[nightshadow]]s who joined [[Malvag]]'s plot in [[1375 DR]].\n\nValdar attacked a [[Eilistraee]]n shrine, claiming the soul of a priestess. Later, Malvag summoned his loyal agents [[Szorak]], [[Urz]], and Valdar to a designated location to cast a spell that would allow [[Vhaeraun]] to enter Eilistraee's domain undetected. However, Szorak was actually [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] in disguise. He managed to kill Urz before he was killed himself, ruining the rite that needed three spellcasters to act.\n\nBy resurrecting and forcing Q'arlynd to cooperate, Malvag and Valdar cast the spell successfully. However, just afterward, to his great surprise, he found he could create [[Moonfire (potion)|''moonfire'']].\n\nThank to Urz's resurrection, they had the answer: Eilistraee had slain Vhaeraun and claimed his portfolio. Valdar was devastated by the news and fled.\n\nIn [[1376 DR]], Valdar was taking refuge in [[Guallidurth]] in the [[Underdark]], and had come to believe that Vhaeraun had succeeded in his plan but deceived everyone by claiming to have instead been defeated. There, he was found by [[Kâras]], a former [[nightshadow]] who had joined the [[Church of Eilistraee]] and had orders to kill Valdar. However, Valdar convinced Kâras of his idea and the latter decided to spare Valdar for the moment.\n\nIn [[1379 DR]], he went in [[Llurth Dreir]] and saved Kâras's life from the fanatic [[Molvayas]]. In truth, Valdar had also apparently joined the Church of Eilistraee and he and Kâras were on a mission to investigate [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers.\n\nDuring an assault by Ghaunadaur's followers on the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]], Valdar explained to Kâras that his plan was to manipulate Ghaunadaur into destroying all drow. Realizing he was insane, Kâras managed to kill him but only by sacrificing himself."
