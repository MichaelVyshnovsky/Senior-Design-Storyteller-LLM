Rhammas Thann was a noble of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was the husband of Cassandra Thann and thus the patriarch of the Thann family, although in his later years, he retired from an active role in family affairs.
He was a hardworking and honorable man who was overshadowed by his wife, Cassandra. 
His son, Danilo Thann, remarked several times that Rhammas in particular disapproved of him and his foolishness.
In 1315 DR, Rhammas convinced his father, Erktos I, to stop the familys involvement in the slave trade.
Rhammas was the eldest son of Erktos I.
He once had an out-of-wedlock daughter named Lilly, who was killed by the Knights of the Shield.
