He ran a shipbuilding company out of both Suzail and Marsember that dealt in the repair and sale of ships, nets, and masts.\nHe had not been found to have broken the law but he was well known to be the person to speak to for silent passage on a ship. Although Maerun was caught by a War Wizard with two bound females, he hired a Sembian mage to claim they were creatures polymorphed into human form for safe transportation. Maerun spent his winters in Marsember.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryMerchants\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryShipwrights\nCategoryInhabitants of Suzail\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nCategoryMembers of the Stoutbold family\nt9ofszaihkgksejs4y0rbkcddtpeimc"
