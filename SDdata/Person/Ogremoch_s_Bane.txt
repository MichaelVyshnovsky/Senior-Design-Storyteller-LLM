'''Ogremoch's Bane''' was a cloud of evil, sentient, invisible magical dust that dwelled in the [[deep gnome]] city of [[Blingdenstone]] in the [[Northdark]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was named after the [[Ogremoch|lord]] of evil [[earth elemental]]s, to contrast it with the presence of [[Entemoch's Boon]] in the city.

==Activities==
As it drifting around the city, any creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] that it came into contact with were freed of any magical control. Moreover, if they were not of good nature, then they were driven into a violent destructive rage. The deep gnomes could not reverse the effects nor [[Banishment|banish]] the earth creatures back to their home plane, so they had to destroy them in order to get rid of them.

After the fall of the city and its abandonment by the gnomes, however, the cloud changed tack. Instead, it collected more and more earth creatures and [[outsider]]s, with dozens of [[earth elemental]]s, [[xorn]]s, [[mephit]]s, [[thoqqua]]s, and others. Rather than making them rage, it had them stand still as statues in the dark rear caverns that housed the city, while it hovered around and whispered words in [[Terran]] promising victory and glory for some unknown purpose.

==History==
It first appeared in Blingdenstone around [[1358 DR]]. The reason for its occurrence was unknown, but elder deep gnome priests theorized that the cloud's presence was somehow tied to that of Entemoch's Boon.

During the [[drow]] attack of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the cloud diverted quite a few of the svirfneblins' extraplanar allies from the defense of the city. It kept them as part of its stored army, but summoned and captured a few others in the years after.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}} a [[pech]] named [[Gallus]] identified Ogremoch's Bane as an atypical earth elemental.{{Cite digital book/Reclaiming Blingdenstone|8}}

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, it was confirmed to be a native of the Elemental Planes and was sent back by a party of adventurers escaping from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] hired by some [[deep gnome]] factions.
