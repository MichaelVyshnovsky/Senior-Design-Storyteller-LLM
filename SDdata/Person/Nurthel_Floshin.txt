'''Nurthel Floshin''' was a [[fey'ri]] who served the [[daemonfey]] leader [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] as her spymaster.

==Description==
Nurthel had only one eye, and it was green.

==Equipment==
Nurthel wore golden [[mail]].

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], he was responsible for stealing a shard of the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]'' from [[Tower Reilloch]]. He

Nurthel was killed on [[Tarsakh 11]], 1374 DR, in a white tower in the [[Elven Court]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]] when [[Araevin Teshurr]] used the magic he had learned from the ''[[Nightstar (selukiira)|Nightstar]]'' to invert Nurthel's magical protections. Araevin stabbed Nurthel through the throat with his own sword, stating that his death was a revenge for the killing of [[Grayth Holmfast]].
