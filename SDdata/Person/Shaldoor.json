Thus, when the shattering of the Ordning occurred, she felt it was a sign from Annam All-Father that they should go to war against their ancient enemies.\nShaldoor reveled in life on the battlefield, believing that war was an inherent aspect of life for giants and especially storm giants.\nShaldoor was a skilled animal handler, known for riding atop rocs and whales.\nShaldoor was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator Uthor in the Storm Kings assault on Iymriths lair. She fought alongside Nimir, Orlekto, and Vaasha.\nAdventures\n* Storm Kings Thunder\nCategoryBodyguards\nCategoryInhabitants of Maelstrom\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryStorm giants\nijjbgadx9n17s22imlfzu2p66r509ku"
