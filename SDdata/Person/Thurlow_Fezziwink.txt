Thurlow Fezziwink was a minor scam artist who worked with his cousin Tudor Fezziwink to find a way to cheat at the dog track in Westgate in the late 14 century DR.
Thurlow was a middle-aged gnome with balding head of graying hair.
In the , Thurlow and his cousin Tudor devised a plan to cheat at the highly guarded gambling establishment called The Track. The dog track and bar thoroughly searched all who entered for any items that could affect a racing hounds performance, such as potions of haste. But Thurlow concocted something he called a simple mixture of spices that could be smuggled past the Tracks bouncers. The gnome spotted a group of well-armed adventurers on the street and chased them down to hire for the simple task of bringing the vial of spices to his brother Tudor Fezziwink.
