'''Thurlow Fezziwink''' was a minor scam artist who worked with his cousin [[Tudor Fezziwink]] to find a way to cheat at the [[dog]] track in [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Right, I've actually hired you for my cousin. He's the one who's going to need the assistance, and he'll be the one to pay you. His name is Tudor Fezziwink, and you'll find him at a nearby tavern called the Track.''|Thurlow Fezziwink}}

==Description==
Thurlow was a middle-aged [[gnome]] with balding head of graying hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Thurlow and his cousin Tudor devised a plan to cheat at the highly guarded gambling establishment called [[The Track]]. The dog track and bar thoroughly searched all who entered for any items that could affect a racing hound's performance, such as ''[[potions of haste]]''. But Thurlow concocted something he called a simple mixture of [[spice]]s that could be smuggled past the Track's bouncers. The gnome spotted a group of well-armed adventurers on the street and chased them down to hire for the simple task of bringing the vial of spices to his brother Tudor Fezziwink.
