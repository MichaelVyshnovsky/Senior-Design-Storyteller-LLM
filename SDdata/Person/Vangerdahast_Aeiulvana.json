        "mainbody": "Vangerdahast Aeiulvana ( and the noble scion Ardhuval Raiserek the fire mage were Vangerdahasts students.\nHe was served by a magical raven-like creature named Myrcrest, who carried messages on his behalf.Though not specified, Myrcrest may be a familiar to Vangerdahast.\nVangerdahast possessed the staff of the High Wizard of Cormyr and the blade Symylazarr, both of which he was able to summon into his hand at will. He also carried a small silver whistle in his belt pouch, which made a loud shrill noise for gaining attention. There were several glowstones in Vangerdahasts belt, which he could use as sources of light. There was also a hollow metal sphere that, upon spoken command, could transform into a key to unlock a secret vault in the depths of the royal palace. It was one of only five, the others possessed by the king, queen, and princesses.\nVangerdahast was a shrewd yet paranoid man he simply had to know everything that was going on in the realm, all the time—and influence it, often using the War Wizards as a servant force in that regard. He influenced them too, removing the hierarchy that may have promoted internal competition and instead assigned them all to various task forces, all of which reported directly to him. His legacy lived on, even though he had retired, with many of the War Wizards remaining capable spies.\nIt was common knowledge in Cormyr that Vangerdahast had a longstanding grudge against Elminster, though the origin of the feud was unknown.\nVangerdahasts favorite chair was in his private library in Castle Obarskyr in Suzail. It was upholstered in the flesh of a sahuagin. He sometimes attended The Laughing Lass, a tavern, and festhall in Suzail, although he was careful to disguise himself.\nVangerdahast was born in 1224 DR. In his youth, he was a spell-slinging adventurer who gained significant fame in that vocation. One of the things that gained him attention of Cormyr was creation of master adventurers robes. These enchanted robes proved to be popular among wizards and sorcerer, protecting their owners from opponents who preferred brute strength over wit and the Art.\nVangerdahast was hired by king Rhigaerd II to tutor Azoun IV in heraldry and ethics.\nIn 1336 DR, when Azoun IV took the throne, Vangerdahast was appointed the Royal Magician of Cormyr and Master of the Council of Mages.\nFollowing the murder of kings envoy Grodoveth outside Ghars on Eleint 18, 1367 DR, Vangerdahast ordered (with a message via Myrcrest) retired War Wizard Benelaius to investigate, and furthermore that Captain Flim of the Purple Dragons garrison should immediately execute the killer. Benelaius speculated Vangerdahast had done this, independent of the king but within his authority, to avoid controversy because of Grodoveths familial relation to Azoun.\nIn the , he was responsible for the awakening of Nalavarauthatoryl and the returning of the goblins of Grodd.\nBy 1372 DR, Vangerdahast had decided to retire from public life and appointed the battle-sorceress, Caladnei, as his successor for the position of Royal Magician.\nBy 1373 DR, Vangerdahast had retreated into a hidden Sanctum so that he could devise a new ultimate defense for the kingdom, for he wanted the kingdom to be truly safe long after he had passed away. The only practical solution was to ensure that the protection would not be a purely magical defense (which might draw mages eager to learn the Mage Royals secrets), which he intended to do by the binding of willing dragons, who would slumber in stasis until they were needed, at which point they could be summoned using key words/phrases and certain gestures using certain objects that only the reigning monarchs and Elminster would know.\nWhen a song dragon named Ammaratha Cyndusk found out about the dragon-binding spell being made, she considered it too risky to allow anyone to develop the spell on the off chance that it was stolen and used to enslave the whole of the dragon race. She confronted Vangerdahast, who swiftly defeated her, but spared her life since he felt he had done too much killing in his life already. When a rogue War Wizard blasted Vangerdahast with a powerful spell, it momentarily shook Vangerdahast, allowing the dragon to break free. Ammaratha proceeded to ask why the wizard had not slain her, and when he explained, her heart softened. But, weighing the risk to dragonkind, she chose to flee and gather fully a dozen other dragons to kill the wizard.\nAt the same time, word had leaked of his experimentation, and a Master Red Wizard of Thay named Harnrim Starangh gathered a small army of other Red Wizards and launched an attack on the kingdom in hopes of distracting the War Wizards and Purple Dragons while he stole the spells of binding. Hearing about Vangerdahasts plan, a group of revolutionaries launched an assault on Castle Cormyr and the Royal family in the hopes of slaying them, further adding to the confusion.\nWhen the dragon host arrived and saw the Red Wizards, they realized that those Wizards might be able to figure out the spells and proceeded to eat, burn, and crush the Red Wizards who, after losing most of their force, proceeded to run screaming from the battlefield that was Cormyr.\nThe dragons then went to Vangerdahasts Sanctum and confronted him. Vangerdahast informed them that he had realized the risk involved in the binding spell, and had chained the spells to himself so that, when he died, the spells and all his notes would be instantly destroyed. Seeing this, Ammaratha told the other dragons to go off and divide her hoard amongst themselves and that she would take care of the problem. She revealed that she had talked to Vangerdahasts old mentor Elminster and had a solution that Vangerdahast become a dragon himself to help defend the realm. Ammaratha then said that she would be his Consort and that they would wait in stasis together. Through Elminsters magic (with the aid of Mystra), Vangerdahast was turned into a dragon (of an unknown type) and the two dragons were bound to the kingdom, waiting in stasis to be called back to defend the Kingdom of Cormyr.\nAs of 1479 DR, Vangerdahasts spirit lived in the royal palace in a wraith-like form.\nIn 1487 DR, Vangerdahast was returned to human form by Mystra.\nAs leader of the War Wizards, Vangerdahast kept tabs on retired members to ensure they did not misuse their magic, often making surprise visits to remind them of this. While some of these retirees, like Benelaius, he had nothing to worry about or were old friends, he didnt wish to appear to be playing favorites."
