'''H'Dang Li''', called the High One, the High Lama, and the High Lord of Oceans, was the first such ruler of the theocracy of [[Tabot]].

==History==
H'Dang Li was born in {{YearlinkConvert|2311|SY}} under a conjunction of [[constellation]]s. A shepherd found him crying in the wastelands just north of the [[Haraki Ridge]] and brought him to the lamas of [[Do'dzin Gompa]], where he would be raised The monks saw the child as pure, born enlightened, and fully at one with the [[Celestial Heavens]], as well as highly intelligent and capable of magical powers, Before long, the holy boy was recognized by all the [[monasteries]] and loved by the peasants, who gave him many presents.

Very soon, the monasteries were reformed and united under the rule of the High Lord of Oceans, H'Dang Li. Over the years {{YearlinkConvert|2317|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|2318|SY}}, they even pushed for control of Tabot itself. The nobles of Tabot mustered their armies against the monks, but H'Dang Li confronted them alone and wielded mighty magic against them. Using the Staff of Oceans, he brought a great flood to a frozen battlefield, and defeating the nobles' army. Unwilling to fight a six-year-old boy, the soldiers lowered their weapons and surrendered.

In the years following, the High Lord of Oceans assumed control of the government and established the Council Kashag and other systems. He took away the lands and powers of the nobles and allowed the monasteries to disband their armies, while arbitrating personally on disputed territories and objects.

In {{YearlinkConvert|2339|SY}}, [[yeti]] from the [[Wu Pi Te Shar Mountains]] attacked [[Frekang Gompa]] in the [[Kume Sa Yeti]]. They killed or kidnapped 280 lamas out of the total of 400. In response, H'Dang Li created the Gates of Ocean to protect the monks of Frekang Gompa. Many more tales were told about the High One, some of them almost unbelievable.<ref>

H'Dang Li reigned for 82 years before selecting a successor and walking away into the mountains. He would be followed by six more High Lords. After death, he was said to sit by the side of the [[Celestial Emperor]] himself.<ref>

===Legacy===
The monks of Tabot taught the common people the legends of the first High Lord. A play known as the [[Whi-yeu Nohg]] told of the life of H'Dang Li. It was performed at Do'dzin Gompa every year by {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, lightning blasted the image of H'Dang Li into an altar in the temple on [[Mount Shun]], during ceremonies at the end of an annual [[pilgrim]]age. Lamas who witnessed it declared it a sign of his special favor and thus demanded privileges, but rivals were suspicious of this miracle.<ref>

==Works==
H'Dang Li recorded his teachings, in his own hand, in a holy tome known as the [[Puvarna]]. This was kept secure in the libraries of [[U'Chan Gompa]]. A five-volume holy book he also wrote himself was stored at [[Pokarr Gompa]].
