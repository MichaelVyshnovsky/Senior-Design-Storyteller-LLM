There she befriended the renowned [[wizard]] [[Rhauntides]].\n\nIn the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], Rhauntides died and, to the surprise of all, bequeathed his tower in [[Highmoon]] to Teesha. She established a small monastery there in [[Rhauntides's Tower]], the first of the Old Order in the Dalelands. It was in operation by the [[1372 DR|Year of the Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. The Deepingdalesfolk were initially wary but soon warmed to them after learning the monks were good neighbors."
