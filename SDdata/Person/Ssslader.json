        "mainbody": "sslader was a lizardman gladiator who fought in the Arena of Hillsfar.\nThe lizardman warrior was a very strong combatant that often tried to fake out his opponents by opening his hand, and then attack with the opposite one. He was also skilled in using a quarterstaff, executing left-right combinations of moves and striking with his powerful tail. However, Ssslader would often get dizzy after using his energy to whip out his thick tail, allowing perceptive opponents to find a gap in his defenses.\nSslader fought in the arena circa 1358 DR."
