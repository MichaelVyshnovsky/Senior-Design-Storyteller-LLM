        "mainbody": "Thardek was a duergar fighter and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.\nThardek was a typically rude duergar who hated surface-dwellers. He claimed that if he had not been enslaved by the drow, his folk would have driven contestants out of the Underdark, or killed them. He believed that his dark elf master was impossible to escape from, as he had mastered the arcane arts, and used his djinni slave, Najim, to stop any rebels. He sold light weapons.\nHe was the cousin of Gorch the Armorer."
