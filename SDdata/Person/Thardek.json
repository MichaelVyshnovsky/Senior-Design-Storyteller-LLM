        "Description": "Thardek was a typically rude duergar who hated surface-dwellers. He claimed that if he had not been enslaved by the [[drow]], his folk would have driven contestants out of the [[Underdark]], or killed them. He believed that his dark elf master was impossible to escape from, as he had mastered the [[arcane]] arts, and used his [[djinni]] slave, [[Najim]], to stop any rebels. He sold light [[weapon]]s.",
        "Relationships": "He was the cousin of [[Gorch]] the Armorer."
