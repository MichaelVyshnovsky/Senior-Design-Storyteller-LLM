'''Urthag the Knife''' was a infamous [[pirate]] who preyed on the [[Dragon Reach]] in [[north Faerûn]] around the early 7th century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88–89}}

==History==
Urthag somehow got his hands on [[Galathos]], a magic sword forged during the ancient empire of [[Raumathar]] and lost many centuries before.

He spent some time in the city of [[Chessagol]] in [[the Vast]], and boldly caroused for several hours at the [[Bloated Gargoyle Inn]]. Finally, the [[Royal Constabulary]] discovered him and tried to arrest him. Urthag fled across the rooftops of Chessagol, but was forced to drop Galathos. Urthag escaped and his sword was given to King [[Lamoth]].

Legend had it that Urthag the Knife buried his treasure on the island of [[Two Rocks]] in the harbor of [[New Velar|Harrowdale Town]] in the [[Dalelands]]. However, not a trace of this hoard was found by the mid–14th century [[DR]].
