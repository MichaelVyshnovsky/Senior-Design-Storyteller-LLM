'''Kanjentellequor Biri''' was one of the few [[dragonborn]] [[wizard]]s of [[Tymanther]] and a member of [[Clan Kanjentellequor]]. She was also a member of the [[Lance Defenders]] and the lover of [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]].

==Description==
Biri was a rare albino dragonborn, with snow-white scales.

==History==
In her youth, the clan elders raised Biri to be an exemplar wife. However, Biri showed talent for [[magic]], and she defied her elders to study wizardry.

In [[1479 DR]], Biri was one of the wizards under the command of [[Kriv]]. She studied [[Nala]]'s documents, and discovered [[Skuthosiin]] was the one controlling the [[Stone giant|ash giants]]. She later assisted [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] and the [[Platinum Cadre]] during the siege of [[Ashhold]].

When Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about [[Tchazzar]] plan's to invade the dragonborn nation, Medrash was assigned to a mission to destroy [[Gestaniius]] and liberate [[High Imaskar]] from her forces, so the Imaskari would lend their aid to the [[thymari]].

After killing Gestaniius, Biri and her friends were sent to [[Luthcheq]] to escort ambassador [[Ophinshtalajiir Perra|Perra]], who wanted to reinstate the diplomatic relations between Tymanther and [[Chessenta]]. However, when they reached the city, the [[Battle of Luthcheq]] had already began. Biri took part in the battle.

She later went to [[Dracowyr]] alongside Balasar, Medrash, the Brotherhood of the Griffon and the surviving dragons of the Battle of Luthcheq. Together, they put an end to Brimstone's ''xorvintaal''. After that, she returned to Tymanther, were she intended to marry Balasar.
