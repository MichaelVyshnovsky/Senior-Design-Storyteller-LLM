'''Linsella''' was a [[hin]] [[True Soul]] of [[the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]]'s kitchens during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''That is the gift the Absolute gave me, when I stood before Her. To rewrite the lives of Her faithful - make them believe they are something better.''|True Soul Linsella}}

==Description==
Linsella was a halfling woman with dark skin and huge brown eyes. Her black hair was in locks, and her face was decorated with a simple chin [[tattoo]]. Linsella proudly wore an [[amulet]] of the Absolute atop her simple dark blue leathers.

==History==
Shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Linsella rose in the ranks of the Absolutists and stood before her "goddess", receiving her blessing. In reality, Linsella was a zealot and became infected by the Absolute with an [[illithid]] tadpole. This gave Linsella [[psionic]] abilities that allowed her to "rewrite the lives of her faithful" â€“ psychic control. Using these mental tethers, True Soul Linsella dominated three [[gnoll]]s. She renamed her new slaves to [[Tomelia]], [[Barnabus]], and [[Timothy]]. Linsella claimed that she'd quelled the gnolls' savage nature and showed them a "gentler way." The halfling cultist truly believed in the goodliness of her actions and believed in "Her Design." The monstrous humanoids were instructed to work in the kitchen, and Barnabus was put in charge of soups. Yet bloodthirstiness and rage still seethed underneath the painful mental domination.

When the gnolls and their mistress encountered a group of the True Soul heroes of [[Baldur's Gate]], they may had been helped by severing Linsella's mental leash, leading to the hin's swift death. Some said that the heroes could've dominated the gnolls themselves, while by other accounts, the three gnolls could've remained under the cult's control and perished with Linsella in an assault by [[Harper]]s and the True Soul heroes on the Moonrise Towers.
