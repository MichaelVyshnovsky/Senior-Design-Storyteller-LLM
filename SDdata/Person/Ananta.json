Skalnaedyr made her Guardian of Dracowyr.\nIn 1479 DR, she fought and lost against the vampiric smoke drake Brimstone when he appeared to parlay with the princes of Murghôm. However, he allowed her to live with the condition that she helped him to contact Skalnaedyr.\nAnanta was released from her service to Brimstone when the vampire dispelled the magic that bounded dragons to play xorvintaal."
