        "daterefs": "In the ebook version of Temptation, the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster theyre in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764 DR. Given Feldrins warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result.",
        "mainbody": "Anlavas Jhoavryn was a merchant in the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe dealt in brasswork and cheap sundries, but worked in bulk.\nThe merchant hailed from somewhere south of Nethra, across the sea.\nDuring the late , his throat was cut while at Nethra. Lord Elminster Aumar, then the Court Mage of Galadorna, made inquiries of the local guard captain, Rhoagalow, who admitted he suspected Limmator to be behind his death."
