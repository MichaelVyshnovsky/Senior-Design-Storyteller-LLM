        "daterefs": "In the ebook version of ''Temptation'', the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early [[Mirtul]]. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during [[Uktar]] of 764 DR. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result.",

        "Activities": "He dealt in brasswork and cheap sundries, but worked in bulk.",
        "History": "The merchant hailed from somewhere south of [[Nethra]], across the sea.\n\nDuring the late {{yearlinkName|764}}, his throat was cut while at Nethra. Lord [[Elminster Aumar]], then the Court Mage of [[Galadorna]], made inquiries of the local guard captain, [[Rhoagalow]], who admitted he suspected [[Limmator]] to be behind his death."
