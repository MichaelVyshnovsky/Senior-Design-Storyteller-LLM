        "Description": "In life, Abadda was a [[green elf]] who had the charisma and strong build of a true prince of [[Phalorm]]. In undeath, his skin and hair turned white, his eyes turned into sunken pools of darkness, and he hid his face with a skull mask.",
        "History": {
            "The Doppelganger": "The priests of Myrkul experimented on this newfound type of undead creature until the Uthtower and their temple sank below the waters of the Mere. They even went so far as to have a [[doppelganger]] eat the brain of the undead elf (which regenerated) and assume Adadda's former identity as a prince of Phalorm. The priests lost control of the doppelganger, however, and it fled to the area known as the [[Fallen Kingdom]] where Abadda once wandered. Once there it became a bandit leader. The false Abadda was later slain by [[Distyl|Distyl of Nesme]] at the court of [[Silverymoon]], where he recovered ''[[Susk|the Silent Sword, Susk]]'' in [[1338 DR]]. Somehow the body was never identified as a doppelganger."
