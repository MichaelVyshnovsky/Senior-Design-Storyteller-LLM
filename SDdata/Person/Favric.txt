'''Favric''' was the local group leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Thundertree]] ''circa'' [[1491 DR]].{{Phandelver-time}}
 
==Description==
Favric dressed in the typical garb of a dragon cultist, wearing a long dark robe and a black leather mask. He could speak [[Draconic]], as well as [[Common]]. The young leader was far more ambitious than others of his sect. Favric wore a necklace that was actually a ''[[potion of flying]]'' attached a band.

==History==
Around 1491 DR, Favric led five other members of the cult to Thundertree, where they hoped to parlay with the [[green dragon]], [[Venomfang]]. The group found a dusty, abandoned home to the southeast of the village. Since then, they tried to determine the needs of the young dragon, so they might broker a deal. Favric had brought three [[diamond]]s to appease the beast.
