Despite her being a mystery, her sword, aptly named ''Kachiko's wakizashi'' ensured that at least the warrior's name was remembered. At some point after the weapon left her hands, the wakizashi traveled to the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], and from there, was brought to the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}} to be sold to some wealthy adventurers."
