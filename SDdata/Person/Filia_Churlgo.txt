Filia Churlgo was one of many children of Millie Churlgo who produced the infamous Churlgo Cheese in the Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Filia was one of the older Churlgo siblings. She had long brown hair and pale milky complexion. Her clothes where covered in strands of old melted cheese.
Filia worked inside the farm building, rarely venturing outside. Her main role was seasoning of the huge cheese vats before it was portioned, solidified, and waxed.
Filia, along with the rest of her family, moved their farm from the Dalelands to Daggerford following a nasty extortion business with the Iron Throne. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably not lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.
