Yulhymbra Tesper was a wizard and noblewoman of the Waterdhavian noble house Tesper.
She lived within Tespergates located at the corner of Mendever Street and Delzorin Street in the central section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward.
Yulhymbra, along with her sister Silpara, was ostracized from the Tesper family for her pursuit of magic which was shunned by her family at the time. They were both later slain by assassins sent by a younger brother who believed she would use her arcane skills to claim power within the family. Her ghost remained within Tespergates, quietly haunting the family villa.
