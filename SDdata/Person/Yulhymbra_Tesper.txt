'''Yulhymbra Tesper''' was a [[wizard]] and noblewoman of the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian noble house]] [[Tesper]].

==Activities==
She lived within [[Tespergates]] located at the corner of [[Mendever Street]] and [[Delzorin Street]] in the central section of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}}

==History==
Yulhymbra, along with her sister [[Silpara Tesper|Silpara]], was ostracized from the Tesper family for her pursuit of [[magic]] which was shunned by her family at the time. They were both later slain by [[assassin]]s sent by a younger brother who believed she would use her arcane skills to claim power within the family. Her [[ghost]] remained within Tespergates, quietly haunting the family villa.
