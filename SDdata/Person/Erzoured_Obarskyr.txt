'''Erzoured Obarskyr''' was the bastard son of Prince [[Emvar Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]] and [[Solatha Boldtree]] in the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

Though raised alongside his cousin, [[Irvel Obarskyr]], in the capital, his place in the royal succession was only guaranteed in the {{YearlinkName|1450}}. Erzoured was known as a threat to the crown, considering his placement in the line of succession, but always feigned loyalty to his uncle King [[Foril Obarskyr I]], despite secretly seeking allies in [[Sembia]], [[Netheril]] and [[Thay]].
