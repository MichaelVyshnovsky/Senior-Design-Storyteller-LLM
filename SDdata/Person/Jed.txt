'''Jed''', also known as '''Old Jed''', was a fisherman who lived in [[Easthaven]] within the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
The aged fisherman was of normal build and dressed in a yellow [[tunic]] and dark [[breeches]].

==Personality==
Over the years, Old Jed became a alcoholic who needed [[wine]] in order to fish the banks of [[Lac Dinneshere]]. The owner of the [[Winter's Cradle Tavern]], [[Grisella]] refused to sell liqueur to Jed because he kept falling out of his boat while fishing.

==Relationships==
While being a drunkard, Old Jed had a kind soul and believed those who were kind to him belonged in the Eternal Brotherhood o' Fishermen.

==History==
Around [[1279 DR]], [[Pomab Ak'azmjir]], owner of [[Pomab's Emporium]], refused to sell Jed any more wine, so the angry fisherman tossed the [[Calishite]] into Lac Dinneshere. In [[ Eleasis]], [[1281 DR]], Old Jed fell out of his own fishing boat and nearly drown in the freezing waters of Lac Dinneshere until some townsfolk pulled him ashore. By [[Eleint]] of that same year, Old Jed was still barred from buying liquor from Pomab.
