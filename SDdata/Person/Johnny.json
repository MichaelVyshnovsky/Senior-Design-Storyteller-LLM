He raised the body of the slain innocents as [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s, including Johnny. Footy witnessed Basillus madly ranting to his undead, thinking they were his dead family. The cild recognized Johnny's knickers on one of the zombie but did not realize that the shambling dead was his brother."
