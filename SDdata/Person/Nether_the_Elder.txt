'''Nether the Elder''', also known as '''King Nether''', was the [[shaman]] king of [[Gers]], one of the seven towns whose coalition formed [[Netheril]].

==History==
Nether the Elder was born in {{Yearlink|-3889}} in Gers of the soon-to-be [[Alliance of Seventon]]. He became the shaman king of Gers sometime before forming the Alliance of Seventon and created Nether's Calendar to celebrate the formation of the coalition.

The shaman was assassinated by a poisoned [[dirk]] from an unknown killer, but Nether was succeeded by [[Nether the Younger]].
