'''Eragyn''' was a female [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] living in [[Zhent]]-occupied [[Daggerdale]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Circa [[1359 DR]], she started an eight-year-long plan to resurrect the evil [[wizard]] and ruler of the dale [[Colderan Morn]] after discovering his crypt.

In 1367 DR, her plan finally came to fruition but soon after the risen Colderan overpowered Eragyn and imprisoned her in the crypt, wanting himself to be the only ruler of the dale. He started spreading a magical illness.

An adventurers' band hired to stop the magical illness found the crypt and Eragyn but her fate was not clear.
