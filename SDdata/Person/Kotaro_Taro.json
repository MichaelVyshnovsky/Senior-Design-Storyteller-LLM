        "mainbody": "'''Kotaro Taro''' was a [[kensai]] adventurer in [[Kozakura]] in the 1350s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Taro was born to the [[Kotaro clan]] as a first son and scion. From his early years, he trained to wield the [[chijiriki]]. He occasionally clashed with local dam-builders when he thought that their actions would greatly weaken the power of his family.\n\nIn [[1355 DR]], a drought put his family in danger. They were saved only thanks to [[Ko Mei Kho]].\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], Taro was among the candidates considered by Ko for a mission in [[Akari]].\n\nIn [[1358]], thanks to the [[Ko clan]], his land was saved. Being the eldest son, Kotaro was expected to work off the debt his family owed the Ko clan. Taro sought to use this opportunity to one day travel to the mainland of [[Kara-Tur]] to see the great rivers there. Here, he may have been approached by [[Ko Ho San]]."
