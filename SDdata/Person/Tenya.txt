'''Tenya''' was a young and powerful [[priest]]ess of [[Umberlee]] who lived on the [[Sword Coast]], near the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate}}

==Abilities==
Despite her young age Tenya possessed tremendous power, which she drew from her patron deity Umberlee.

==Activities==
She and her mother lived in a house near the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge of [[Baldur's Gate]], on the opposite side of the [[River Chionthar]].

Tanya served as a priestess at the [[Water Queen's House]], located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] docks.

==Possessions==
The young girl wore pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]''.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Tenya's mother was robbed by numerous fisherman, including [[Jebodah]], [[Sonner]], and [[Telman]]. She spent weeks searching for the thieves, trying to recover her mother's lost ''[[bowl of water elemental summoning]]''.

During her hunt for the malicious fisherman Tenya repeatedly harried them, drowning two of them and sinking a ship with a dozen more.
