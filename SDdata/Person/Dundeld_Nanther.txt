Dundeld Nanther was the Lord Envoy of the Council of Lords in Melvaunt around 1367 DR. His death in 1373 nearly started a new civil war inside the city.
Dundeld was an old man. This fact had all three of the powerful families of Melvaunt hungry to fill his vacant seat on the council, in the event of his likely death, with one of their own.
