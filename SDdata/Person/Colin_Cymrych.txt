'''Colin Cymrych''' was High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the first half of the 6{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|32}}

==Relationships==
He was a member of the [[Cymrych Dynasty]] and the son of his predecessor, High King [[Carrig Cymrych III|Carrig III]], and of High Queen [[Abigail (queen)|Abigail]]. His successor was his son, [[Gordon Cymrych]].

==History==
Colin's father was assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|500}}, when Colin was only eight years old. His mother thus appointed [[Edmund Kincaid]] of [[Snowdown]] to rule as regent in his stead. Colin would eventually assume the throne of the High King in the {{YearlinkName|507}}.

Colin became famous for clearing [[werewolves]] from [[Torriage Wood]] in [[Callidyrr]]. However, he himself had contracted [[lycanthropy]] by the {{YearlinkName|549}}, and so he was slain by his son, Gordon, who assumed the throne that same year.
