        "mainbody": "'''Olothontor''' was an unusual [[blue dragon]] living near [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1373 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Olothontor wanted to find a female blue dragon mate who could sing (a nearly impossible task), heard the music of all the finest [[minstrel]]s on [[Toril]], and collected items and [[spell]]s that helped in his project. Often, he tried to approach [[song dragon]]s but always without results because Olothontor's personality always repelled those good-oriented dragons.",
        "History": "During the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Olothontor was courting the song dragon [[Karasendrieth]] but the good dragon, in order to distract him, gave Olothontor hints about a bardic spell able to suppress the Rage. Quickly, he started studying bardic music and thanks to this Olothontor managed to suppress and survive the Rage.",
        "Personality": "Olothontor, despite not being a good creature, had an obsession for fine music. He truly wanted to survive the Rage.",
        "Relationship": "Olothontor had some contacts with a large number of musicians and [[Harpers]] who gave some music to him in exchange for protection. He once mated with the adult blue dragon [[Ingeireirautha]] of [[Anauroch]] but their relationship ended badly and they occasionally skirmished."
