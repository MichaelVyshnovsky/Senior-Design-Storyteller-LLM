Luckily, Verner and the others were housed by [[Ebenz Farbough]] and [[Bea Farbough]], two farmers without children, in a farmhouse near the city.\n\nVerner lived there for two years, developing a bond with the goat [[Jovee]]. ''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Jovee was in an unusual state. Some adventurers who happened to come near the farmhouse were asked to help but Jovee give birth to [[demon]]ic goats.{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|10}}"
