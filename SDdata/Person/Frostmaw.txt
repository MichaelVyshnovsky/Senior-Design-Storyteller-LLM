'''Frostmaw''' was a great white wyrm that plagued the frozen tundras of [[Icewind Dale]] some years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].While it is implied to not be a true white dragon, it is unclear what this "white wyrm" actually is. It may be an albino [[remorhaz]], known as a polar worm, or a [[lesser dragon]] such as a [[tundra landwyrm]].

==History==
Frostmaw was a fearsome beast, almost as big and powerful as a true [[white dragon]]. It was slain by a [[ranger]] defender of the [[Ten-Towns]] named [[Kellem Longeyes]] some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. Even though the white wyrm perished at the ranger's weapons, it left disfiguring scars on Kellem's face, taking his eye and years with Frostmaw's icy breath. Subsequently, Frostmaw's skull was tuned into the elaborate [[enchanted]] [[helm]] Kellem Longeyes called ''[[Wyrm's Maw]]''.

In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Wyrm's Maw'' was recovered from a nest of two white dragons and their white wyrms in the [[River Caves]] just south of the Spine of the World, from whence the [[Black Raven River]] began and ran south across the [[Cold Marshes]].
