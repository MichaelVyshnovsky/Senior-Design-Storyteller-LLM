Jio was truly devoted to the Way, often unable to stop himself from lecturing followers of other religions about their wrong choice. He loved tournaments, seeing it as an opportunity to enlighten his opponents.

Many stories were told about his exploits, like when he defeated and subsequently healed and enlightened nine robbers on the Silver Road west of To Ming. The robbers afterward threw their weapons into the Hungste River and founded the Fei Het monastery.
