Merrik was a loyal warrior of the Zhentarim operating from around the town of Yûlash, active in the late 14 century DR.
Merrik showed no respect to Captain Haliator Mendara of the Red Plumes, thinking him to be a poor fighter.
In the , the Zhentarim became targeted by a mysterious Order of the Crippled Fang. The Shind Road that connected Hillsfar to the rest of the Moonsea region became swarmed by the fiends in service to the cult. The creatures relentlessly attacked Zhentarim patrols and agents. Merrik and his fellow men were among those who stood against the fiends, and a shadow dragon Gloomfang, leaving him bloodied, battered, and hurt but alive. The Zhent fighter reached the safety of Yûlash only to be arrested by Haliator Mendara and his Red Plumes as an enemy to the Red Plumes. Haliator toyed with the idea of executing Merrik where he stood but decided to take the Zhent prisoner, heal his wounds and have him stand trial in Yûlash.
