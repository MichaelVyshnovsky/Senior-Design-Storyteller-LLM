        "mainbody": "The Count of Duskmere was an elven nobleman of the Time of Dragons, living in the 25 millennium before Dalereckoning.\nAmong his activities as a minor ruler, he engaged in much treason.\nHe was the father of Winterflower Duskmere, and the head of House Duskmere.\nIn the year , the elven house of Duskmere was involved in a treasonous attempt to strike at the forces of King Orchtrien of Dawnfire. These rebel forces almost won, but were personally routed by Prince Bexendral, who teleported to their aid. To punish the elves for their treachery, King Orchtrien had them send their sons to his court, where they would be educated and serve as hostages to ensure no more treachery was attempted. One of the hostages he sent was Lady Winterflower Duskmere, his own daughter.\nLater, his daughter returned to their forest, carrying a trove of the Kings spellbooks. The King hid her and his court at a secret stronghold in response, biding some time to read the spellbooks. However, the stronghold was found by Orchtriens forces, which came in Winterflowers pursuit. The stronghold was razed the Count was almost certainly slain in the battle."
