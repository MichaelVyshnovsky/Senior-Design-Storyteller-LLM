'''One of Many''' was a creature of pure distilled malice, once imprisoned within the [[Death God's Vault]] in shadow [[Mulsantir]] until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I hear tell as far away as Rashemen that the spirits are stirring. Something has woken, something is hungry. That is all I have heard, all the voices here can teach me. It is mysterious.''|[[Tanerieh]] of [[Samargol]]}}

==Description==
One of Many appeared as a floating horned wraith-like mass of swirling shadows with massive humanoid hands. Its conscience consisted of a multitude of evil individuals, murderers, killers, and the criminally insane. These evil souls were trapped inside the Death God's Vault crematorium's incinerator in which their lives ended. The spirits were gradually driven mad over several decades by their imprisonment and their unending malice and hatred for the world.

==Personality==
One of Many radiated a palpable aura of power and malice.

==Possessions==
By some unknown means, One of Many came into possession of the ''[[First Imaskarcana]]'', which it carried with it into the jungles of [[Samarach]].

==History==
The creature was formed when the evil souls were unleashed from their torturous prison by some means between the {{YearlinkName|1373}} and the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. Driven by a hunger to consume sentient beings or to sow death and violence upon them, eventually, One of Many manifested in the jungles of the [[Samarlogh]] in the hidden kingdom of Samarach on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].
