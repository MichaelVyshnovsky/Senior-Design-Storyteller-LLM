        "History": "Kwan Ching Lo was appointed Minister of Public Works around [[1328 DR]]. For many years, he was embarrassed by the success of Governor [[Kawabi]] of [[Chu' Yuan]] province, who demonstrated a great ability in managing public works in his province.\n\nAt last, in 1358 DR, he understood the true potential of the [[Gathering of the Pearls]] proclamation and started sending adventuring party to all uncharted areas of the Empire and supported rebuilding projects. His dream became to restore the cursed city of [[Kuo Meilan]], an idea most of the [[Mandarinate]] were adverse to."
