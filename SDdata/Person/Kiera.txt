'''Kiera''' was a [[Faer√ªn]]ian female [[adventurer]] and founder of the [[Iron Maidens]] adventuring company in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kiera was a [[human]] that stood {{SI|5'9"|ft-in|long=yes}} tall and weighed around {{SI|129|lb|k}}. She sported attractive features, short blond hair, and an athletic build. She usually wore brightly colored clothing that had the symbol of her patron deity [[Helm]] embroidered on them.

==Personality==
Kiera was brave individual with great love for exploration and travel. She was incredibly loyal to her friends, willing to go any length to avenge them.

==Possessions==
She always had a ''+3 [[broadsword]] [[frostbrand]]'' had her side, which she named "Garavor." She also possessed a pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', ''[[splint mail]] +2'', and a ''[[potion of cloud giant strength]]''.

==History==
From an early age Kiera was trained in the art of warfare, winning her first fight at the age of thirteen. She went on to become an adventurer, traveling with a wide variety of adventuring companies over time. One day she decided to call up female adventurers she had traveled with the past, such as the [[thief]] [[Lyrissa]], and with them formed the adventuring company [[Iron Maidens]]. Over time she and the rest of her company became enemies of [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

One day a rich merchant hired the Iron Maidens for a mission, that turned out to be a set-up orchestrated by agents of Fzoul. All but Kiera and Lyrissa were killed in the process, with the two having escaped the trap with a valuable necklace from Fzoul's treasury. Later they exacted revenge upon the merchant, Kiera killing him, and  she went on to recruit the [[wizard]] [[Tiralia]] to their company.
