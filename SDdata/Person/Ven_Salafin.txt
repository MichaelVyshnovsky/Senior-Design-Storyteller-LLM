'''Ven Salafin''' was an [[Uthgardt]] [[human]] of the [[Elk tribe]] of the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Relationships==
He was the brother of [[Sven Salafin]].

==History==
In the conflict known as the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] sometime around [[1400 DR]],<ref group="note">The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The {{yearlinkName|1402}}, is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the [[Cult of the Dragon]] for control of the Helmet of Disjunction.

But as he escaped the battle with the helm, Ven was injured and lost his [[horse]]. He was forced to crawl to safety, then collapsed, and lay dying. At last, he was met by the heroic [[Thayan]] [[paladin]] [[Xenk Yendar]], who inspected his wounds but could not help him, and promised to keep safe the Helmet. Believing him, Ven gave up the helm and expired.

A century later, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the body of Ven Salafin was exhumed by [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Simon Aumar]], [[Doric]], and [[Holga Kilgore]] (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's ''[[deathly token]]'' to [[speak with dead|speak with the dead]], they questioned Ven's corpse over the fate of the Helmet of Disjunction, but Edgin was scornful, insisting to Ven that the Thayan had lied. They departed, but with more questions left, Edgin asked Ven what his favorite [[book]] was, but it would take him some time to decide. In fact, Ven's corpse would be left waiting quite some time for someone to ask him the final question.

==Personality==
Having an eclectic interest in historical works of [[the Art]], Ven listed ''[[The Fanged Tome of Lykanthus Szar]]'' and ''[[Galadaster's Orizon]]'' as among his favorites.
