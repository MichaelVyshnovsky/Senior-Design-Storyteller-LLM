Ven Salafin was an Uthgardt human of the Elk tribe of the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier in the late 14 century DR.
He was the brother of Sven Salafin.
In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors sometime around 1400 DR,The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of Honor Among Thieves, which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The , is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the Cult of the Dragon for control of the Helmet of Disjunction.
But as he escaped the battle with the helm, Ven was injured and lost his horse. He was forced to crawl to safety, then collapsed, and lay dying. At last, he was met by the heroic Thayan paladin Xenk Yendar, who inspected his wounds but could not help him, and promised to keep safe the Helmet. Believing him, Ven gave up the helm and expired.
A century later, in the late 1490s DR, the body of Ven Salafin was exhumed by Edgin Darvis, Simon Aumar, Doric, and Holga Kilgore (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simons deathly token to speak with the dead, they questioned Vens corpse over the fate of the Helmet of Disjunction, but Edgin was scornful, insisting to Ven that the Thayan had lied. They departed, but with more questions left, Edgin asked Ven what his favorite book was, but it would take him some time to decide. In fact, Vens corpse would be left waiting quite some time for someone to ask him the final question.
Having an eclectic interest in historical works of the Art, Ven listed The Fanged Tome of Lykanthus Szar and Galadasters Orizon as among his favorites.
