        "mainbody": "'''Cortarra''' was an [[evil]] [[enchantress]] who resided in the north of the [[Lord's Keep]] in [[Llorkh]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Cortarra was described as being a short woman with long, dark hair. She wore a red outfit that was fastened by a skull emblem. The enchantress was said to be fascinated with the protector of [[pilgrim]]s that lived by the [[Unicorn Run]], [[Lezoul]] of the Great Oaks. She dwelt in a luxurious room in the upper levels of Geildarr's keep.",
        "Possessions": "The [[magic-user]] owned a ''[[dagger]] +2'', a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'' and a set of ''[[bracers of defense]]''. She also owned a few [[dart]]s, which she fought with if not in a good position to cast [[spell]]s.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], a prisoner called [[Siulajia]] was captured by the [[Zhentarim]] and taken to meet with [[Geildarr Ithym]]. Cortarra, who was close to Lord Geildarr, became very jealous when she found out another woman was meeting with the lord. The frustrated mage chained Siulajia up, but did not kill her, keeping her locked up in her room instead.\n\nSome time later, Cortarra wrote a letter to Lord Geildarr, claiming that Siulajia knew nothing of important events that concerned the [[Zhentarim]]. However, she was interrupted by the [[Heroes of Ascore]], and at this point leaped upon her prisoner. After the struggle, both women stood to their feet, but appeared identical, the enchantress having transformed into Siulajia. They both claimed to be Siulajia in identical voices, but the heroes managed to tell them apart, and rescued the prisoner.\n\nThe enraged [[mage]] attacked the party with a contingent of Zhentarim soldiers and her [[cockatrice]]s, but was slain."
