{{Quote|Kel. You'll shatter the frail bonds of my ruse. I'm a regular guest in this establishment. A respected agent of arms and experienced talent to wield them. Speaking of that, I may have a little job for you...|Thurbrand, reuniting with his friend [[Kelemvor]].}}

==Description==
He had piercing, emerald-green eyes and fine, gold hair that thinned out by around his 30{{th}} year He lost what what hair he had left when he made an unwanted pass at a certain [[Cormyr]]ean [[Mystra (Midnight)|spellcaster]] that later became a goddess.

==Personality==
The jovial mercenary was very outgoing if a little disingenuous in his dealings.

He dreamed of building a stronghold in the [[Stonelands]] but he knew he did not have the power to defeat the [[Zhent]]s in the area so he waited for the right opportunity to carry out fulfill his ambitions.

==Abilities==
Thurbrand was exceptionally knowledgeable about the Stonelands, and knew many valleys and tombs in the area.

==Relationships==
The mercenary was friends with [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] even after the two had a falling out over some forgotten disagreement.

For a time he rode atop a black stallion with a dark red mane.

==History==
Having lived as a warrior from his earliest years, Thurbrand led numerous campaigns in the Stonelands to fight [[orc]]s, [[troll]]s, [[kobold]]s, bandits, and even more dangerous creatures. These expeditions were dangerous and led to few of his companions returning safely to civilization. On one occasion, when fighting a [[dark naga]], Thurbrand came back as the only survivor; while on another, the evil [[Zhentarim]] wizard [[Whisper]] killed seven of the Thurbrand's companions.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Thurbrand and his Company of Dawn accompanied his old friend Kelemvor, along with his traveling companions [[Midnight]], [[Adon]], and [[Cyric]], who recently fled Arabel accused of crimes they did not commit. While the mercenaries and adventurers traveled together through [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] to [[Shadowdale]], the Company of Dawn suffered many death by the forest's [[giant spider]]s. Despite their losses, Thurbrand helped Kelemvor and the others gain admittance into the dale, and even returned to Arabel to try and help clear his name in Arabel.

==Possessions==
During his adventuring career, Thurbrand amassed a large amount of treasure.
