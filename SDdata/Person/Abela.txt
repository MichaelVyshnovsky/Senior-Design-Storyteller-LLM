'''Abela''' was a [[nymph]] that lived in the region of the [[Sword Coast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I am not without fault, but 'tis my nature to breed obsession in people. A hazard of being just who and what I am.}}

==Abilities==
Abela had the inherent ability to elicit great feelings of passionate desire in others, to the point of unhealthy fixation.

While Abela was ageless like other nymphs, her spirit and essence faded away when she was not in her natural environment.

==Relationships==
The Baldurian mage [[Ragefast]] formed an unhealthy infatuation and obsession for Abela. Ragefast believed her to be the love of his life and the two were meant to be with one another.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Abela was abducted by Ragefast of [[Baldur's Gate]], and taken to his home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]]. Ragefast sought to make it a permanent home for the two of them, despite the fact Abela being away from her glade was slowly killing her. Fortunately, her confinement was observed by a local noblewoman named [[Lady Hannah]].

At the same time, the mage and acclaimed naturalist [[Ramazith Flamesinger]] sought out Abela, for the [[material component|spell components]] he could harvest from her body.
