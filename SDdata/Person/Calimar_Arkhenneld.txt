'''Calimar Arkhenneld''' was a [[drow]] [[lich]] [[enchanter]] of the city of [[Sshamath]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the Master Emeritus of the [[School of Enchantment and Charm]], as well as a former member of the ruling [[Conclave of Sshamath]]. 

==History==
Calimar was more than thirteen hundred years old by the late 14{{th}} century, putting his birth in the 1{{st}} century DR.

In time, Calimar became the leader of the School of Enchantment and Charm and so a member of the ruling Conclave. He later resigned and dedicated himself to magic.Calimar's retirement from the Conclave is not mentioned in ''Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark'' but may be inferred from his [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emeritus Emeritus] title.

In the {{YearlinkName|994}}, Calimar married [[Meiyaralea Santruvel]], a drow with the wild talent of shapeshifting and considered a monster by her own kin.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Elminster's Mysterious Drow Apprentice}}

==Relationships==
He was the father of [[Susprina Arkhenneld]], a mysterious apprentice of the archmage [[Elminster Aumar]]. She was born in the {{YearlinkName|996}}, the same year Calimar became a lich.

==Activities==
Calimar had little interest in the everyday politics of the city and the Conclave. Instead, he concentrated on studying the mysteries of magic, devoting himself to the goddess [[Mystra]].

He was also the top creator of [[magical item]]s in the city. In his long years of activity, Calimar had created hundreds of unique magical objects, some copied from examples brought back from fallen [[Netheril]].
