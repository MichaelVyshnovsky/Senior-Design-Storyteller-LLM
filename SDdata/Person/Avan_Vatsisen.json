        "mainbody": "Avan Vatsisen was a Thayan wizard active in the early 1370s DR.\nHe was originally based in Eltabbar. He was sent by his Red Wizard master to Scornubel to oversee the transportation of rare spell components, available only in the Western Heartlands, back to Thay. He was accompanied by two flesh golems.\nWhile on a trip to Baldurs Gate, Avan met Arahnar on the roadside, and used his magic to entice her to fall for him. They made their way off the road and into a grove of trees, where the werewolf transformed into her semi-human form and attacked him, giving him five large scars on his chest. She would have killed him if his bodyguards had not been close by. Since that event, Avan was obsessed with Arahnar to the point of following her whereabouts with a crystal ball and working on a spell which would make her fall in love with him.\nAvan shunned the traditional appearance of the Red Wizards and had dark hair and a full beard, although he still wore scarlet robes. He had five scars on his chest, inflicted by the claw of Arahnar. His skin was sallow, and he was aged about circa 1371 DR.\nAvan wore a ring of fire resistance and a ring of regeneration, and carried a wand of lightning and a wand of magic missiles. He also wielded a magical +2 dagger.\nAvan developed the spells charm lycanthrope, detect lycanthrope, and protection from lycanthropy in his bid to win Arahnars favour."
