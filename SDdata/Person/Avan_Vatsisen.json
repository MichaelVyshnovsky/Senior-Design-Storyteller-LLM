        "mainbody": "'''Avan Vatsisen''' was a [[Thay]]an [[wizard]] active in the early 1370s [[DR]].{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Four}}",
        "History": "He was originally based in [[Eltabbar]]. He was sent by his [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] master to [[Scornubel]] to oversee the transportation of rare [[spell component]]s, available only in the [[Western Heartlands]], back to Thay. He was accompanied by two [[flesh golem]]s.\n\nWhile on a trip to [[Baldur's Gate]], Avan met [[Arahnar]] on the roadside, and used his magic to entice her to fall for him. They made their way off the road and into a grove of trees, where the [[werewolf]] transformed into her semi-human form and attacked him, giving him five large scars on his chest. She would have killed him if his bodyguards had not been close by. Since that event, Avan was obsessed with Arahnar to the point of following her whereabouts with a crystal ball and working on a spell which would make her fall in love with him.",
        "Description": "Avan shunned the traditional appearance of the Red Wizards and had dark hair and a full beard, although he still wore scarlet robes. He had five scars on his chest, inflicted by the claw of [[Arahnar]]. His skin was sallow, and he was aged about ''circa'' [[1371 DR]].",
        "Equipment": "Avan wore a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'' and a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'', and carried a ''[[wand of lightning]]'' and a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]''. He also wielded a magical ''+2 [[dagger]]''.",
        "Magic": "Avan developed the [[spell]]s ''[[charm lycanthrope]]'', ''[[detect lycanthrope]]'', and ''[[protection from lycanthropy]]'' in his bid to win Arahnar's favour.{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Five}}"
