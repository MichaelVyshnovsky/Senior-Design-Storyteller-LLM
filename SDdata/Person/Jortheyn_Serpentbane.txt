'''Jortheyn Serpentbane''' was the High Sheriff of the village of [[Auvandell]], within the [[Silver Marches]], during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He received this title and authority from [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]], the ruler of [[Sundabar]] at the time, in gratitude for services he rendered to the fortress-city in [[Old Delzoun]].

==History==
Before he retired to his leadership role, Jortheyn was an adventurer.
