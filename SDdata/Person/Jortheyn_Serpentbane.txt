Jortheyn Serpentbane was the High Sheriff of the village of Auvandell, within the Silver Marches, during the late 14 century DR. He received this title and authority from Helm Dwarf-Friend, the ruler of Sundabar at the time, in gratitude for services he rendered to the fortress-city in Old Delzoun.
Before he retired to his leadership role, Jortheyn was an adventurer.
