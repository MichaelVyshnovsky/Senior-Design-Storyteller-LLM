        "mainbody": "'''Mirol III''' was the [[merfolk]] prince of [[Eadraal]] in [[Myth Nantar]].",
        "History": "Born in [[1345 DR]], he was a bookish [[cleric]] of [[Eadro]]. Then, after the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] and King [[Vhaemas]]'s injury, Mirol was chosen as temporary regent. Thanks to the help of his sister [[Arina]], he did a good job but in [[1370 DR]] he was still trying to recover [[Voalidru]], Eadraal's capital, from monstrous hands.",
        "Activities": "Mirol managed the necessities of his exiled people very well, though he previously cared more about the church of [[Eadro]]. Despite objections by some people, Mirol was firm in maintaining the [[Nantarn Alliance]] in respect for his father's decisions.",
        "Personality": "Mirol at heart was a shy and nervous individual. He managed to serve well thanks to the support of his wife and children.",
        "Powers": "Mirol had the ability to unleash an electrical touch, which was bolstered by his appointment as regent."
