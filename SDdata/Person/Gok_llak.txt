'''Gok'llak''' was a male [[grimlock]] [[barbarian]] who served the [[mind flayer]], [[Quthnorak]], in [[Vournoth's Mire]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Description==
Considered a fine example of his kind, Gok'llak was an enormously muscular grimlock. A thick mane of black hair clung to his head and tough grey skin covered his body. His particularly large ears were adorned with a mix of rings and gemstones.

==Personality==
While under the thrall of Quthnorak, Gok'llak would readily carry out his master's will, even until death.

==Abilities==
Strong and very tough even for a grimlock, Gok'llak was a particularly powerful barbarian. Chosen as Quthnorak's only thrall due to his martial prowess, the grimlock wasn't dependent on light, owing to his natural blindness, and wielded his [[battleaxe]] to great effect during his frenzied battle style.

==Possessions==
Gok'llak wore a set of ''[[hide armor]] +2'' and a pair of ''[[bracers of health]] +2'', both of which made him even tougher. In battle, the grimlock wielded a ''[[keen]] [[battleaxe]] +2'' with surprising prowess.

==Relationships==
Enthralled by Quthnorak, Gok'llak was completely subservient to the mind flayer, to the point that he would battle to the death to defend his master.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Gok'llak was the exclusive slave of the [[mind flayer]] [[psion]] [[Quthnorak]]. The illithid considered the grimlock to be a notably fine specimen and more than a match for the thralls of his rival, [[Sekrr]].
