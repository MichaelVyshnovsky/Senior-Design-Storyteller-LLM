        "mainbody": "'''Thrrothgrrowl''' was the son of the [[wemic]] [[Tenpaw]] tribe King [[Grrothgrrowl]], the most powerful king of the [[Shining Plains]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "King Grrothgrrowl fathered a son in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. The birth happened shortly before the visit of [[Adamar Session]], [[Bard]] of [[Starmantle]], during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The bard attended the annual remembrance vigil held at the [[Hill of Memories]] in the Shining Plains and witnessed several individuals, including a female member of the [[Emerald Enclave]] congratulating Grrothgrrowl with Thrrothgrrowl's birth. Adamar mused about the wemic prince in his guide to Vilhon Reach and speculated that at the time of writing, Thrrothgrrowl was likely an adult."
