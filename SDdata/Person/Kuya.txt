'''Kuya''' was an [[earth spirit]] from the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]] who resided on the [[Fire Mountain]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kuya, just like the terrain around his home, was made of rock. He was an earth spirit, a sentient type of [[earth elemental]]. When he chose to interact with other intelligent creatures, Kuya took on a vaguely [[humanoid]] shape, 3 [[Nubari]] tall, or {{SI|18'|'"|long=yes}} tall.

Being an ancient elemental creature, Kuya's perception of time differed from that of mortal species. A whole year was nothing but a moment for him. He spoke in an excruciatingly slow and wondrous way.

==History==
Kuya came into existence on the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau a millennia before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He had a brother, [[Yaku]], who lived far to the west of Kuya's home.

In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. When a band of Jungle's heroes traveled to stop the Mother of a Thousand Young, they came across the spirit. Kuya was curious about the strange creatures and felt overwhelming looniness since the mysterious disappearance of his brother "a moment ago," a cycle prior for the heroes, after the spider katanga took to inhabit the caverns underneath the Fire Mountain. When the poison started affecting the land, it caused the spirit great emotional pain. Kuya cherished life, and as it perished around him, he fell into despair. He was also disturbed by the tremors of the volcanic mountain.

When the heroes acted with kindness towards the elemental, he blessed their weapons made of rock or [[obsidian]], gifting them a temporary ''+1'' [[enchanted|enchantment]] to aid against the malicious spider katanga, allied with the planar force of evil known as the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]].
