Old Lenn was a lighthouse keeper and retired sailor that lived along the Raven Cliff Beach area of the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
Lenn was a regular patron of the Broken Crown inn on the High Road. He was considered a friend of the Harpers they sometimes paid him to light beacons as signals to their agents.
He claimed to have had a relationship with a "my sweet Rohini". He received a number of love letters from her while he was at sea.It is not entirely clear if Old Lenn was referring to the Prophet Rohini, the succubus that took over the city of Helms Hold, or another woman of the same name.
He had both lumbago and rickets, which naturally prevented him from dishing out whuppins.
In the , when the Harper mage Xalliana failed to make a rendezvous at the Broken Crown, fellow Harper agent Seven Toes requested the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to find Old Lenn and ask him if there had been a recent shipwreck. There hadâ€”Lenn said the Blackdagger Bandits had extinguished the warning beacons so they could loot stricken and wrecked ships, and had done so two nights before. At Lenns recommendation, the adventurer relit the beacons as a Harper signal and found Xalliana. Old Lenn also suggested the adventurer knock holes in the bandits boats to sabotage their efforts.
However, while he was away drinking at the Broken Crown one time, the bandits stole a chest of Old Lenns belongings and stashed it within the Hidden Cove on Raven Cliff Beach. He solicited the help of the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover his chest and Rohinis letters, and revealed the location of the Hidden Cove.
