'''Meo Li''' was a noble of the [[Meo]] family of [[Xai Chung]] in [[Koryo]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
Meo Li was the daughter of [[Meo Yungdo]] and sister of [[Meo Cha]].

==Activities==
Meo Li had spent her whole life in Xai Chung, raised at the family's ancestral mansion. She was kept cloistered with the women of the household: her mother and her maiden aunt, female servants, and tutors. She was taught the skills of calligraphy, poetry, languages, and courtly etiquette.

==History==
Although sheltered, when she was 14, she saw three dead bodies of members of Koryo's "night brotherhoods" in Lu Chan Street ''circa'' [[1347 DR]], apparently having slain each other for dark secrets.

Around [[1350 DR]], the [[king of Silla]] ordered "nameless ones" of one of these brotherhoods to kidnap Meo Li (then only 17) and Meo Cha and sell them into slavery. His reason was unknown; it may have been for leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. The [[ninja]] swung down from the rooftops, used [[green sleeping dust|magic sleep powder]] on her, and whisked her away from her guards.It is not clear which of the siblings Meo Li and Meo Cha is speaking in the "Races and Classes" section on page 124 in the Koryo chapter of ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms''. As Meo Cha's kidnapping in [[Tu Pe]] is slightly different (as mentioned on the same page), it is assumed to be Meo Li. Thus details of her kidnapping and events on Lu Chan Street are assumed to be in Xai Chung, not Tu Pe or [[Pyong-do]].

Fortunately, Meo Li and Meo Cha were reunited and managed to escape. They stowed away on a ship that, rather than being bound for Xai Chung as they'd thought, was in fact part of the king's own secret invasion fleet, now underway for [[Kozakura]]. But a tsunami wrecked the whole armada and the siblings were lost at sea. 

Surviving the disaster, the Meo children were washed ashore, alive and well, in distant [[Shou Lung]] at [[Yu Tai Shuni]]. The [[dragon]] [[Mei Lung]] found them and allowed them to live in [[Impossible Palace of the Silver Domes|his house]], where he gladly heard tales of their homeland. He later related their stories to [[Elminster]].

Meo Li and Meo Cha eventually returned safely to Koryo, where the tyrant king had abdicated and their father became advisor to the new king, [[Wanang Sun]].
