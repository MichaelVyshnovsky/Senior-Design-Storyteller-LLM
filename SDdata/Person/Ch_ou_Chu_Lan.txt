Chou Chu Lan was the Chamberlain of Shou Lung in 1358 DR.
Rumors said that Chou Chu Lan was originally a monk student of the Dragonfly school of kung fu and that he so impressed the young Kai Tsao Shou Chin with his clear thinking that the Emperor immediately appointed him to the Imperial household. Chou Chu Lans duties were to take care of all Imperial palaces, castles, and retreats, managing and paying the staff and even the guards. He was always calm and composed even in the most chaotic situation.
