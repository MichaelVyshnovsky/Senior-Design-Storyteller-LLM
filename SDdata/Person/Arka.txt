'''Arka''' was a female [[tiefling]] that lived in [[Elturel]] before being forced to live on the road for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Why do you care if a [[goblin]] lives or dies?|Arka to one of the [[True Soul]]s.}}

==Description==
The tiefling had mid-long black hair and horns that curled up and back. Arka wore a brown jerkin with rings sparsely positioned throughout it. The jerkin covered a blue long-sleeved garment.

==Posessions==
Arka carried her brother, [[Kanon]]'s handkerchief after his death at the hands of the Absolutists.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Arka's brother [[Kanon]] was killed by a [[goblin]] when her she and her fellow tieflings were taking refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] [[druid]]ic enclave.

A [[goblin]] known as [[Sazza]], who was part of the cult of [[the Absolute]], was captured at the grove, and Arka wished to take her anger out on her. She grabbed a [[crossbow]] and considered shooting her dead.

Arka may had ended up dead with her corpse overlooking the bridge to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] in 1492 DR.
