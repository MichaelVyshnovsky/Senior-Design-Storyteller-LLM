'''Garrik Oakspear''' was an [[elf]] [[thief]] who served as the chief spy of the [[archmage]] [[Halaster Blackcloak]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Garrik regularly traveled throughout the city of [[Waterdeep]], at least once per week, and collected information for his master Halaster. He patrolled the various levels of Undermountain, stalked trespassing adventurers, and reported upon their various activities to any of the "Mad Mage's" apprentices. He was granted a personal allowance and was not above taking down lone interlopers to free them of their wealth and possessions.

He frequented establishments in [[Skullport]], but made his home in [[Wyllowwood]]. His simple abode was filled with many [[paper]] sketches of the same woman.

==Relationships==
Garrik was infatuated with the [[druid]] [[Wyllow]] and felt exceptional joy whenever she paid him the slightest amount of attention. Halaster knew any potential romance was an impossibility, While Wyllow was aware of his feelings, the two maintained a semblance of friendship.

==Possession==
Among Garrik's possessions were a ''+2 [[short sword]] of quickness'', a ''[[wand of flame extinguishing]]'', a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', a ''[[horned ring]]'', and a ''[[brooch of shielding]]''.

==History==
Some time during the 14{{th}} century, Garrik was forced to flee to Undermountain after he earned the enmity of [[Xanathar]], leader of the eponymous [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. While he believed his exceptional skills would keep him safe within the deeper reaches of the dungeon, he was stopped and apprehended by [[Muiral]], one of Halaster's apprentices. Seeking to punish Garrik and make him suffer, Muiral brought the thief before his master Halaster. Rather than kill the intruder, Halaster cast a number of ''[[charm]]'' [[spell]]s upon the elf until his natural [[magic]]al resistance was penetrated and he came under the archmage's sway.

Garrik revealed all he knew about Xanathar's Thieves' Guild to Halaster and quickly became his lead surface scout.
