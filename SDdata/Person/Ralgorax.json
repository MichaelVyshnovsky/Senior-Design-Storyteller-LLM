        "mainbody": "Ralgorax, known as the \"Sword of Tyr\", was a mighty paladin who lived sometime before the mid&ndash14 century DR.\nHe fought with a great sword and shield.\nRalgorax died in battle alongside his horse, yet many years later&mdashwhen both were little more than shriveled corpses&mdashthey rode again as undead to defend Ralgoraxs home village from a nighttime attack by a horde of orcs. He rode through the village while banging his sword and shield to rouse and warn the people, and then fought off the orcish scouts until dawn. But in the light of day, the villagers were disgusted to see his undead appearance, so he sadly saluted them before charging to meet the horde head-on."
