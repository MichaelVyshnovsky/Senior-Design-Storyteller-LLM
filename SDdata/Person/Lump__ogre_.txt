Lump the Enlightened was a particularly canny and articulate ogre mercenary that worked on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.
Lump was quite well-spoken for an ogre and did the speaking for his group of three. While he displayed eloquence and a discerning taste for food not often found among other ogres, Lump was just as greedy and gluttonous as they came.
He could be considered one of the faithless as he did not worship any particular deity.
While Lump maintained his exceptional intelligence originated from his healthy appetite and varied diet, it was likely the effect of the headband of intellect he wore.
He also kept with him a war horn, that allowed employers to call for he and his companions in battle.
He worked alongside two less-intelligent ogres, Chock and Fank.
As of the , Lump and his subordinates worked for the cult of the Absolute, keeping post at the ruined town of Moonhaven on the Risen Road. In exchange for gold and their choice of goblins to eat, the trio were responsible to ensuring that anyone that passed through town was marked with the brand of the Absolute, lest they venture too near the cults outpost at the Shattered Sanctum.
Lump had no loyalty to the Absolute beyond his love of the gold and food they offered.
