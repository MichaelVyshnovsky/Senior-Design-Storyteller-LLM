The two woman were [[mage]]s&mdash;a rarity in Teshburl&mdash;and with his blessing they practiced their skills in the secret basement level of the tower.",
        "History": "Atiq had previously lived in [[Memnon]], until he learned that he had inherited a wizard's tower from his uncle. So he moved his family south to the isolated town of Teshburl and converted the former magic school into an inn and tavern. He had never fully understood all the secrets the tower had to offer.",
