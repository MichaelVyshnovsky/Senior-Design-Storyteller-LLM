Elyril Hraven was a secret priestess of Shar and one of the architects of the Sembian Civil War in 1374 DR.
In 1374 DR, Elyril was the main advisor to her aunt Mirabeta Selkirk. Under orders of Shar, she worked with one of the Princes of Shade, Rivalen Tanthul, in order to start a civil war in Sembia. In truth, she was a follower of Volumvax. She immediately disliked Abelar Corrinthal.
In her youth, Elyril killed her parents and devoted herself to Shar.
In the , under orders of Rivalen Tanthul of Thultanthar, but unknown to Mirabeta, Elyril poisoned Overmaster Kendrick Selkirk. Later, she manipulated Mirabeta and the Sembian High Council to elect Mirabeta as acting Overmistress, receiving with the open hostility of Saerb and Selgaunt led by Endren Corrinthal of Saerb.
During a diplomatic mission to Yhaunn, Elyril found instructions from Shar herself in The Leaves of One Night.
After the alliance between the Shadovar and Selgaunt was secure, Rivalen decided they no longed needed Elyril, who had been an unnecessary witness to his plots. So the Prince used a spell to kill Elyril from a distance, but she was saved by Volumvax, unknown to Rivalen. So Elyril focused on The Leaves of One Night and learned to unleash the Shadowstorm.
On Nightal 1, Elyril Hraven at last summoned the Adumbral Calyx upon Ordulin, unleashing the Shadowstorm. But on dying she understood that Volumvax also considered her only a pawn and she asked for the goddess for comfort. Shar only congratulated her on the success of her mission and sent Elyril into oblivion.
