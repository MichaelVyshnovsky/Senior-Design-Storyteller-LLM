'''Elyril Hraven''' was a secret priestess of [[Shar]] and one of the architects of the [[Sembian Civil War]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Relationship==
In 1374 DR, Elyril was the main advisor to her aunt [[Mirabeta Selkirk]]. Under orders of Shar, she worked with one of the [[Princes of Shade]], [[Rivalen Tanthul]], in order to start a civil war in [[Sembia]]. In truth, she was a follower of [[Volumvax]]. She immediately disliked [[Abelar Corrinthal]].

==History==
In her youth, Elyril killed her parents and devoted herself to Shar.

In the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, under orders of Rivalen Tanthul of [[Thultanthar]], but unknown to Mirabeta, Elyril poisoned Overmaster [[Kendrick Selkirk]]. Later, she manipulated Mirabeta and the [[Sembian High Council]] to elect Mirabeta as acting Overmistress, receiving with the open hostility of [[Saerb]] and [[Selgaunt]] led by [[Endren Corrinthal]] of Saerb.

During a diplomatic mission to [[Yhaunn]], Elyril found instructions from Shar herself in ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''.

After the alliance between the [[Shadovar]] and Selgaunt was secure, Rivalen decided they no longed needed Elyril, who had been an unnecessary witness to his plots. So the Prince used a [[spell]] to kill Elyril from a distance, but she was saved by Volumvax, unknown to Rivalen. So Elyril focused on ''The Leaves of One Night'' and learned to unleash the [[Shadowstorm]].

On [[Nightal 1]], Elyril Hraven at last summoned the [[Adumbral Calyx]] upon [[Ordulin]], unleashing the Shadowstorm. But on dying she understood that Volumvax also considered her only a pawn and she asked for the goddess for comfort. Shar only congratulated her on the success of her mission and sent Elyril into oblivion.
