'''Bren Tallsword''' was a male [[human]] [[fighter]] and the commander of the forces stationed at [[Castle Crag]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Tallsword was a rigid and strict disciplinarian. He also had no qualms about holding the fort at all costs, even to the loss of all lives, including his own.

==Activities==
Answering to the [[Warden of the Eastern Marches]] in Arabel, Bren Tallsword commanded the garrison at Castle Crag, comprising 500 [[Purple Dragons]] and a detachment of [[War Wizards]]. He had a standing order to hold the castle against invaders, at all costs, but was confident reinforcements from Arabel would arrive or rout invaders before any got past him, provided he gave them time. The Crown considered him ideal for his role in the kingdom's defense.

Unusually, Bren hired [[psionicist]]s to instantly transmit secure messages via [[telepathy]] to Arabel in the event the castle was attacked. The leadership in [[Suzail]] studied the system and considered implementing it throughout the realm, but some conservatives feared it would trigger an arms-race with [[Zhentil Keep]] and the Stonelands and would be costly and difficult to manage. Furthermore, they feared the psionicists themselves and giving them such a vital role in the kingdom's defense. However, Bren's plan proved its worth when one of his psionicists, [[Ormion Bowbreaker]], predicted a vicious [[gnoll]] raid. [[War Wizards]] interrogated Bren's psionicists and declared them trustworthy, and a recruitment drive began.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

He was known to call for frequent drills and inspections. He gave no welcome to adventurers, sending them away as soon as he could. He even had taverns and hostels near the castle demolished to prevent distractions to the soldiers, but soldiers and adventurers regularly rebuilt them.

==History==
Bren Tallsword was serving as commander of Castle Crag by [[1367 DR]]. He remained in the post by [[1372 DR]].
