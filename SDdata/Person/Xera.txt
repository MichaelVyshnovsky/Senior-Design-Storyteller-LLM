'''Xera''' was one of ten guards stationed at the [[Hinnar's Red Wizard enclave|enclave]] run by the young [[Red Wizard]] [[Hinnar]].

==Abilities==
Xera was tough, strong, and dexterous.

==Possessions==
Like the other guards at the enclave, Xera was trained in the expert use of the [[bastard sword]] and possessed a finely crafted example. Xera also carried a [[longspear]] and a [[composite longbow]] and was trained in ranged combat at short range.

==Activities==
Xera worked in alternating shifts guarding the six watch platforms, observing the sales booth, or patroling the compound grounds.

==History==
When adventures came to the enclave, seeking information about the kidnapping of [[Talf]] and [[Elonn]], Xera was completely ignorant of the fact that the two young men had been taken by the [[wizard]] [[Kizzaf]].
