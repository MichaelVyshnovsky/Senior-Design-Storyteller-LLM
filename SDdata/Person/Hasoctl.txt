Hasoctl was a human fighter in Maztica.
Hasoctl gained everything in life thanks to his connection with his great-uncle, the Revered Counselor Caxal. He entered into the service of Lord Drakosa but secretly worked for Caxal.
In 1362 DR, he was tasked with accompanying an adventuring party hired by Drakosa to find the Cloak of One Plume. In truth, he would deliver it instead to his great-uncle.
Hasoctl was always worried about something his health, his wealth, the respect of others, the place of the gods in the universe, etc. At heart, he was a coward, always escaping from danger. However, he considered himself a practical philosopher, particularly in dealing with others.
