'''Fodel''' was an infiltrator from the [[Cult of the Dragon]] at the [[Damaran Gate]] of [[Bloodstone Pass]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/The Rite||prologue}}

==History==
Fodel was born and raised in [[Damara]], but became devoted to the teachings of [[Sammaster]].

On the night of [[Mirtul 2]], in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Fodel and his comrade, [[Avarin]], opened the Damaran Gate for the [[Bandit Army]] of [[Vaasa]]. The man slew one of his fellow soldiers, [[Natali (soldier)|Natali]], to prevent her from warning the rest of the garrison about an incoming [[flight of dragons]]. He was almost found out by a [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] because of the gore on his chest where his war cloak did not cover. He and Avarin were almost stopped by the garrison, but an arriving [[Malazan]] slew them, allowing the two cultists to open the gate.
