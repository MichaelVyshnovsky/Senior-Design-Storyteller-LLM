Tosker Nightsword was the owner and proprietor of the Calling Horns inn by 1370 DR.
The inn was given to him by an adventuring group known as the Bored Swords. As a retired guide and hunter, Tosker was as familiar with the Evermoors and the western region of the High Forest as well as anyone else in Faerûn.
