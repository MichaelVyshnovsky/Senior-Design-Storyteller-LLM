'''Aulagol''' was an [[illithilich]] [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Concord of Elders]] that governed the [[illithid]] city of [[Ch'Chitl]] in the [[Northdark]] of the [[Underdark]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During a visit to the [[Astral Plane]], Aulagol allowed a raiding party of [[githyanki]] to discover his ''[[astral projection]]'' and to pursue him to the astral portion of the city's [[elder brain]]. 

Taking desperate measures, the [[ulitharid]] [[Thalynsar]] transformed himself and several other [[illithid]]s, including Aulagol, into [[lich]]es so they could devour the elder brain, preserve its knowledge and powers, and take its place. Successful in their endeavor, the illithiliches formed a [[Conclave of Elders]], with Thalynsar as the most powerful among them. He tried to retain much of the elder brain's knowledge for himself, but the excessive information steadily turned him insane, a trait that Aulagol noted. 

Nevertheless, Thalynsar ruled Ch'Chitl for over a hundred years. Finally, around [[1370 DR]], Aulagol and the other Elders united and were obligated to kill the insane Thalynsar. However, they struggled to lead in his place and divide the elder brain's lore.
