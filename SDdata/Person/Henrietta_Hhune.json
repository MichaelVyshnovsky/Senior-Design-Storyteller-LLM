        "mainbody": "'''Henrietta Hhune''' was the daughter of [[Hurlbut Hhune]] of the [[Hhune]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''If I kick up a fuss, it might blow back on Hen. She's got troubles enoughâ€”Derque Rillyn is a major arsehole.''|Manip [[Leythim]]}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Henrietta Hhune became romantically involved with handsome Manip [[Leythim]] of the [[Flaming Fist]]. Despite their tryst, Henrietta was already betrothed to [[Derque Rillyn]] of the [[Rillyn]] patriar family, a man of a notoriously poor attitude. Henrietta's father, Hurlbut, organized Leythim to be beaten up by a group of thugs to scare away the manip's affections and secure Henrietta's highborn marriage. Leythim accepted the physical threat and the marriage, being afraid of any blowback against Henrietta."
