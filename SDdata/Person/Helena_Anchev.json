        "mainbody": "Helena Anchev was a Bhaalspawn and a devoted follower of Bhaal who served her god during the 15 century DR.\nHelena was born to an unknown female doppleganger and Sarevok Anchev, a Bhaalspawn. Helena worshiped and loved Sarevok and had a child, Orin, with her own father. Sarevok in turn claimed to love Helena and Orin, presumably as the \"heritors of his essence\".\nHowever, Sarevok told Helena that Orin must be her offering in order to become Bhaals Chosen. Helena attempted to kill her daughter, but Orin killed Helena first. Helenas corpse was put on display in Orins room in the Temple of Bhaal and was still there by 1492 DR."
