'''Drizfryn Oblodra''' was the weapon master of [[House Oblodra]] circa [[1358 DR]].

==Personality==
Drizfryn was a violent psychopath, kept in check only by his mother. He cared nothing for his underlings and their deaths.

==History==
Drizfryn was the fourth son of [[Matron Mother]] [[K'yorl Odran]] but held the position of second boy thanks to the deaths of two of his older brothers. He was always in search of new methods to test himself and his warriors, putting them in impossible situations and not caring for casualties.
