'''Lady Quallem''' was a female [[human]] and once the head of the [[Quallem]] family before she arose as a [[ghost]] in the [[Dordrien|Dordrien crypts]].

==Description==
Lady Quallem had a regal look about her and dressed in gowns both elegant and long.

==Abilities==
Although not any great threat in life, she became quite a potent ghost in undeath. Any who viewed her were open to her horrific appearance that could weaken even hardy heroes. In addition, as a ghost, Lady Quallem had the power to possess and animate a statue bearing her likeness in her tomb, which she could put to crushing affect against would-be tomb robbers.

==History==
Some time during the rule of Dordrien before its fall in {{Yearlink|-75}}, Lady Quallem rose to prominence as the head of the Quallem family. Eventually, she died and her body was interred in the family crypts amid the [[Dagger Hills]] along with her eccentric son, a noted [[wizard]]. However, Lady Quallem later rose as a restless [[spirit]], prevented from passing on to the [[afterlife]] until her last descendant was buried beside her. Even as late as [[1372 DR]], her crypt had not been broken into thanks to a rather potent death-dealing [[spell]] trap.
