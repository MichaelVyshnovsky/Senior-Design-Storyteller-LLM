        "mainbody": "'''Jandar Ilbaereth''' was an [[moon elf|elven]] [[wizard]] who venerated [[Lathander]] and served within the military branch of the deity's [[church of Lathander|church]], the [[Order of the Aster]].",
        "Description": "Even for a moon  elf, Jandar was tall and slender. His fair skin was so pale it appeared as if it were tinged with blue. He had silver hair and gold eyes that were flecked with purple.",
        "History": "In the [[1361 DR|Year of Maidens, 1361 DR]] Jandar joined the [[vampire]]-slaying group known as the [[Foes of the Fang]]. This band was determined to defend their people against the growing [[undead]] threat that was previously all-but-unheard of to the people of [[the North]]. It was during his adventuring years that Jandar met [[Corinna Lathankin]], the woman whom he would later marry.\n\nWhen traveling through [[Mirabar]], Jandar briefly disappeared from the group. After a short absence he returned to them, with warning about a group of vampires that had infested the city. After defeating the undead, the Foes of the Fang discovered that Jandar had been turned and were forced to slay him as well. He made a complete recovery however and was successfully ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' with no ill-lasting effects.\n\nJandar and Corinna were the only members of the group to survive their expedition into [[Castle Khommel]] several years after Jandar's death. While the couple emerged with their lives, their comrades all perished in the stronghold within the [[Greypeak Mountains]]. Upon their return to the city of [[Waterdeep]] the couple joined the Order of the Aster, continuing their crusade against the vampiric scourge of the North."
