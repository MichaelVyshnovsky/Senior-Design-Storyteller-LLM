Vesryn Aelorothi was a feyri sorcerer of House Aelorothi of Siluvanede and a member of the daemonfey in the early 1370s DR .
He was incredibly tall but also so slender as to be skeletal. He had dark copper-hued hair. Although quite fiendish in his true form, he adopted a mundane appearance more of the time. He favored a moon elf of noble aspect and quiet manner and human sorcerer with portly build and wild, white-blond hair.
As a feyri, Laelran had the powers to cast detect thoughts and suggestion once a day each, and was resistant to fires and mundane weapons.
Following the liberation of the daemonfey in 1369 DR, Vesryn quickly pledged himself to House Dlardrageth and the daemonfey, and swore his obedience to Countess Sarya Dlardrageth.
In the early 1370s DR, he was based at a daemonfey bolthole along the northern edge of the High Forest along with Teryani Ealoeth and few other daemonfey of their scouting party.
After the death of Nurthel Floshin in 1374 DR, Sarya promoted Vesryn as her new spymaster, thanks to his knowledge about modern Faerun.
After losing the Cormanthor War, he, alongside most of the remaining feyri, tried to escape inside the Waymeet but at last was killed in the fighting.
He readily made himself available to serve the Dlardrageths plans, usually taking part in raids or scouting missions.
Vesryn possessed gracious and courteous manners but also exquisite cruelties. He believed fully in Sarya Dlardrageths plans and enjoyed carrying out her orders.
Vesryn wielded a magical +1 longsword, wore +1 elven chain and a ring of counterspells (magic missile), and equipped with two potions of cure moderate wounds, a potion of neutralize poison, a scroll of flashburst, a scroll of lesser ironguard, a wand of Melfs acid arrow, two waterstars (500 gp each), and a hand-drawn map of the North kept in a leather scroll case.
He had a bat familiar.
