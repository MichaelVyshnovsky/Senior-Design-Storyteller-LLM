        "mainbody": "Coriolis Rillevay was a rock gnome sorcerer, clockwork sculptor, and adventurer who was active around Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR. She drew her power from wild magic, and was versed in a wide range of spells.\nCoriolis had fair skin, red hair, and green eyes. She stood about  and weighed about .\nAs a driven craftswoman specializing in clockwork and sculpture, Coriolus took great pride in her work and was not shy about demolishing a piece if she found flaws in it. She was quick to pick up expertise, and had a knack for adopting the strengths of others, especially those who put challenges in her way. She aspired to not only be the best at her craft, but to be recognized as such. This attitude spilled over into the rest of her personality, making her something of a perfectionist. She believed that there was great power in impossible dreams, and this beleif served to inspire some of her art.\nAlthough she was prone to being moved into action by need, opportunity, or inspiration, she was cool and calm under pressure as a result of her experiences dealing with unpredictable wild magic surges.\nShe owned a set of worn machine tools which she called her \"instruments of art\" and which she used to carve fine details into her sculptures. Her spellcasting focus&mdashboth in combat and while sculpting&mdashwas a shard of silver known as the seal of invention, which replaced the wand of tinkering with which she had begun her adventures.\nShe wore the boots of relentless motion, the gems of endless variety, and a ring of spell turning, and she also carried a number of magic items, including a wind fan, a wand of wonder, a centered gear, a ghost lantern, and the unique wand of essential adaptation.\nCoriolis often went into battle with a unique style of weapon which she crafted herself a hovering and orbiting set of objects which she could direct to attack. She had at least four variations of this weapon the intricate rings, the molten orbs, the coalescing cores, and the constellation of power.\nAs an adventurer, Coriolis helped to protect her city of Waterdeep at the behest of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand. She fought alongside and counted as allies Halbenet Soladonel, Naomlen Girdaur, Shevarith Kendia, and Tommus Tallstep.\nCoriolis was born in the mid&ndash15 century DR into a family of clockwork artisans in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep. From the time she was very young, she dreamed of travelling among the stars.\nAs both a natural-born spellcaster and artist, she would spend her free time using magic to construct sculptures using leftover parts. One day, she experienced a wild magic surge which caused her to plane shift into the Astral Plane and back. This experience broadened her horizons in terms of magic, and led her on the path to becoming an adventurer.\nWhen she was around 40 years of age, she was working with Open Lord Laeral Silverhand to combat threats to Waterdeep. She also continued with creating clockwork sculptures, and would work on them between her adventures. By this time, she had developed a signature style using her blend of craftsmanship and sorcery, and would put her art on display accompanied by magical light shows.\nAt some point in the late 15 century DR, a mysterious patron gave her a ring of spell turning, stating that it was meant as an advance payment to secure some unspecified future work, and at the same time, to keep her safe so that she would live to make said work."
