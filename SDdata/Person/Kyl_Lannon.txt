{{quote|''Look at me, I'm a dragon too. Rarrr!''|Kyl Lannon}}

==Description==
In his youth, Kyl had a buzz-cut brown hair, bright blue eyes, and achene. He was a cheerful and happy child.

==Relationships==
Kyl was son to [[Ginni Lannon]] and [[Pitney Lannon]], two soldiers and defenders of West Harbor. He had several siblings including [[Pitney Junior Lannon|Pitney Junior]], [[Kiri Lannon|Kiri]], and [[Kaye Lannon]], as well as two much older siblings.

==History==
After the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, soon after the [[Mere of Dead Men]] was briefly consumed by a short but deadly conflict known as the [[Second War of the Shadow]], Kyl's parents volunteered to go on a rescue mission to retrieve the village [[mage]], [[Tarmas]], from the lair of [[black dragon]]s [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]]. Kyl Lannon was still too your to understand the danger and ran around the village pretending to be a terrible black dragon himself.
