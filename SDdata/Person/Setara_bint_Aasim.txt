Setara bint Aasim was a money-changer living in Hawa in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR.It is possible that there are two people with the same name, but because the timelines do not overlap and there are no obvious contradictions, it is assumed that these two publications refer to the same person until proven otherwise.
Setara was an attractive woman, and she would openly flirt with men to gain information.
Setaras money-changing business was merely a front to mask her true purpose for the Cult of Istishia as a holy slayer for the Dark Wave. Setara would flash a special coin used by the cult for recognition by their members. If anyone wished to keep the coin they would be marked for assassination. She also made note of solitary children roaming the market, targeting them for kidnapping.
In Waterdeep, she bought the Marblehearth rental villa on the north spur of the mountain and converted it into a festhall that quickly gained popularity around the city.
Setara was the sister of her fellow Dark Wave members Shadha and Sahlah.
She made an enemy in Rokkek Ingerr by taking control of his business. He wallowed in self-pity but looked for ways to have her assassinated.
A rumor circulated around Waterdeep that Setara had two genies for servants.
