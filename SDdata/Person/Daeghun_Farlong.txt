'''Daeghun Farlong''' was a male [[Elf|elven]] inhabitant of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Following his wife's death, Daeghun was grim and harsh, especially to his foster child, the [[Kalach-Cha]]. He expects his orders to be respected and completed. Nevertheless, he was shown to be sensitive, as he defended the Kalach-Cha from being attacked by the [[undead]] and went to search for his foster child after the attack on the [[Mere of Merdalain]].

==Abilities==
An eminently skilled [[ranger]], Daeghun was considered to be one of the finest archers around the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. He favored the use of the [[longbow]] in combat and was not above using [[poison]] on his arrows.

==Activities==
Daeghun often went into the swamp to hunt animals, to trade their fur with the merchants. He attended the Archery Contest at the [[Harvest Fair]]. Finally, he joined the defense at [[Crossroad Keep]], to scout out the enemy.

==Relationships==
He was the adoptive father of the Kalach-Cha, and the half-brother of Duncan.

==History==
===Early Life===
Daeghun was a scout of West Harbor, who was skilled with the bow. He was a friend of the Kalach-Cha's mother, [[Esmerelle]], and had a wife, [[Sheila (West Harbor)|Sheila]]. However, both women were lost in the [[First Shadow War]]. Due to this, Daeghun adopted the Kalach-Cha, but remained grim.

===During the Shadow War===
He raised the Kalach-Cha as a villager. During the Harvest Fair of [[1374 DR]], he tasked the Kalach-Cha to trade with [[Galen]] for a [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] bow. He also oversaw the Archery Contest, where people could shot bottles as targets. When [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] attacked, he attacked the last wave, then healed the surviving villagers. He ordered the Kalach-Cha to retrieve a [[silver shard]], then to go to [[Neverwinter]] to Deaghun's half-brother, [[Duncan Farlong|Duncan]].

When the Kalach-Cha became a Knight Captain, Daeghun enlisted himself for the aid of Crossroad Keep, scouting on the enemy. He also aided his adoptive child when [[Black Garius|Garius]] ordered the undead to attack. After hearing about the news of the fate of the [[King of Shadows]] and his adoptive child, Daeghun went to search for the Kalach-Cha.

===Mask of the Betrayer===
When the Kalach-Cha returned to the village, Daeghun was glad his adoptive child was alive. And may attend the wedding of his child with [[Gannayev-of-Dreams|Gann]]/[[Safiya]].
