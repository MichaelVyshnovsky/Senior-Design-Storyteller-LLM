        "mainbody": "elith Auvryndar was a drow member of House Auvryndar in the drow settlement in the Sargauth Level in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nMelith was frustrated to command only a few troops and to need to rely on Trissa. For this, she welcomed adventurers that could change the situation in the level.\nMelith led the Auvryndar offensive inside the Twisted Caverns and was waiting to challenge the victor of the conflict between the local aboleths and kuo-toa. Meliths strategy was to first destroy the kuo-toa and later eliminate the aboleth, however she commanded only a few drow troops and did not have enough soldiers for large-scale-attacks.\nShe was usually praying in front of a shrine of Lolth with her wife Thirza nearby.\nMelith was a priestess of Lolth and a daughter of Matron Mother Vlonwelv Auvryndar.\nIn 1492 DR, under orders of her elder sister Trissa Auvryndar Melith lead a small Auryndar contingent inside the Twisted Caverns.\nMelith was in love with the drow mage Thirza, who however was more interested in prestige than Meliths love."
