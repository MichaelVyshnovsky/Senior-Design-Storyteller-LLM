Durlim was one of the bandits under the Iron Fox in the midâ€“8 century DR.
The men of the Iron Fox wore light armor and brought no lances or horses.
When Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, carried out a scouring of the bandits in Buckralams Starn, Durlim remained with his boss, the Iron Fox, until moments before his death at Fox Tower. They were ambushed at the mess hall, where Elminster almost struck him down with a crossbow quarrel to the face moments after he was ordered to the gallery as a veteran, Durlim managed to block the quarrel with his gauntlet.
