        "mainbody": "Gobo was the myoshu of a very small village in Kozakura in 1357 DR.\nIn 1357 DR, Gobos village was visited by sohei of the Black Temple, who asked for a payment of rent. Gobo had never heard of this temple and refused to pay, and sent a message to the jito of Tosa for support. Afterward, despite the presence of some adventurers in the village, a large group of sohei attacked and executed Gobo for his lack of cooperation.\nGobo was by nature stingy and manipulative. He was subservient to rich people or local officials, but to all others he was stern and inhospitable."
