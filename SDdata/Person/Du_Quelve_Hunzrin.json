Iccara promised to DuQuelve a load of arandur and the service of a deep gnome slave, Symvyn Rivenstone. However, Zaknafein, Jarlaxle, and Kimmuriel Oblodra suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara was revealed to be a yochlol. In the end, Zaknafein destroyed Iccara, injured DuQuelve and freed Symvyn.\nIn later years, DuQuelves career stagnated despite her claim to having been in league with two yochlols, as all knew she had only been tricked by the handmaidens."
