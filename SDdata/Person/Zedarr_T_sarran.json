        "Description": "Although Zedarr was of average height for a male [[drow]], he was an imposing figure in his black [[Plate mail|full plate armor]]. He kept his visor down most of the time (especially in combat) due to terrible scars across his face. Zedarr's dark skin was mottled with pink burns marks.",
        "Personality": "After Zedarr was captured and hideously scarred by [[ranger]]s of the [[Dalelands]] he became consumed by the retributive tenets of his goddess, [[Kiaransalee]]. The [[blackguard]] fully embraced the virtue of \"''answer any slight a thousandfold''\" to the extent he held an eternal grudge against all the people of the Dales. He took a fierce delight in battle and had an appreciation of fine furnishings.",
        "Relationship": "Zedarr had developed a strong bond with the [[fiend|fiendish]] [[displacer beast]], [[Ripper]].",
        "Abilities": "A skilled [[fighter|warrior]] and commanding leader, in combat Zedarr whirled both ends of his double-ended [[dire flail]] faster than the eye could see, often crippling his foes weapons with his blows. He had also cultivated a dirty fighting style that took advantage of the weak points of his enemies.\n\nZedarr's favor with his goddess granted him powers beyond the ken or ordinary soldiers, suffusing him with a despairing aura. These powers also enabled him to command undead and even smite goodly folk.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Born to [[Irae T'sarran]], Zedarr grew up in the [[drow]] city of [[Maerimydra]] alongisde his sister [[Dorina T'sarran]]. At some point, Zedarr was captured by [[ranger]]s of the [[Dalelands]] during a raid on the surface. He managed to esacape but not before suffering horrific burns in the process. Consumed by a thirst for vengence, the [[blackguard]] of [[Kiaransalee]] hunted down and killed the realatives of the men that captured him.",
            "Silence of Lolth": "In [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]], Zedarr and Dorina were sent by their mother to hunt down refugees fleeing the recent fall of Maerimydra. By [[Marpenoth 12]] they had the refugees to the outpost of [[Szith Morcane]] where they slaughtered ruling [[House Morcane]]. A few days later, under the urgings of Zedarr they commenced new raids against the lands of [[Daggerdale]] from the overthrown Szith Morcane."
