        "mainbody": "he King of Feathers was a magical tyrannosaurus rex that reigned supreme as the monster lord of the ruins of Omu in Chult in the late 15 century DR. He was feared by all the other creatures that dwelt within the remnants of the Forbidden City.\nHe made his lair within the ruined amphitheater located in the former city, usually resting there during the day and heading out to hunt at night. The sizable footprints in the mud there warned of his presence to all who explored within. While most wise creatures of Omu avoided the amphitheater, five deinonychuses laired in the stands, and ventured out to hunt whilst the King of Feathers was away.\nTrue to his name, the King of Feathers had brilliant plumage that differed from others of his species. His feathers were long and slender and came in green, orange, and scarlet hues. The huge dinosaur had feet over  in length from heel to toe, and dropped dung piles bigger than a dwarf. His coming was presaged by his thunderous footfalls, his shape in the mist, and his terrible roar rolling over the city.\nCompared to a regular tyrannosaurus, the King of Feathers was extraordinarily resilient and resistant to harm. Furthermore, the King of Feathers had numerous supernatural abilities. It could readily see invisible beings and objects and walk through mist at will and appear a short distance away. In addition, it could breathe out a swarm of wasps that attacked on behalf of the King of Feathers."
