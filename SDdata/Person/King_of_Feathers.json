        "mainbody": "True to his name, the King of Feathers had brilliant plumage that differed from others of his species. His feathers were long and slender and came in green, orange, and scarlet hues. The huge [[dinosaur]] had feet over {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} in length from heel to toe, and dropped dung piles bigger than a [[dwarf]]. His coming was presaged by his thunderous footfalls, his shape in the mist, and his terrible roar rolling over the city.",
        "Lair": "He made his lair within the ruined amphitheater located in the former city, usually resting there during the day and heading out to hunt at night. The sizable footprints in the mud there warned of his presence to all who explored within. While most wise creatures of Omu avoided the amphitheater, five [[deinonychus]]es laired in the stands, and ventured out to hunt whilst the King of Feathers was away.",

        "Abilities": "Compared to a regular tyrannosaurus, the King of Feathers was extraordinarily resilient and resistant to harm. Furthermore, the King of Feathers had numerous supernatural abilities. It could readily see invisible beings and objects and [[misty step|walk through mist]] at will and appear a short distance away. In addition, it could breathe out a [[swarm]] of wasps that attacked on behalf of the King of Feathers."
