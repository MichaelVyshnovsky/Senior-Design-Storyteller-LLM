However, a bulette freed itself and other monsters. Tanaroo hired some adventurers, including the soon-to-be-famous Gareth Dragonsbane, to capture the monsters before they killed someone.\nIn 1359 DR, after capturing new monsters, Trundles went back for a new tour in Impiltur. Tanaroo acted as ringmaster with Trundles staying behind the scenes.\nTanaroo always traveled with Doctor Trundles."
