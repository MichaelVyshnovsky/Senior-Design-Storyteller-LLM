Nocturne was a tiefling follower of Shar who performed the role of quartermaster in the Cloister of Somber Embrace hidden under the House of Grief in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
Both her hair and eyes were of purple color. She had pale white skin and two black, medium-sized horns.
Nocturne was very loyal, both to her goddess and her friends. She was sildur, and had renounced her former name, Rennald.
Her closest companion whilst being trained in the cloister was Shadowheart. She did not hesitate to protect her whenever in trouble, even when facing odds not in her favor.
Sometime in the late 15 century DR, she joined the Church of Shar and started training as an initiate under Mother Superior Viconia DeVir. 
When Shadowheart eventually joined the cloister as well, she and Nocturne became close friends and protected each other from trouble, such as when being bullied by other initiates. The two had a hiding place behind the storage area, where they would play, read, and style each others hair. This was also where Nocturne would take Shadowheart whenever she was stripped of her memories by the Mirror of Loss, in order to remind her of everything that has been taken away from her mind. When Viconia sent Shadowheart off on a mission to claim the Astral Prism and disappeared without a trace, Nocturne became sick with worry over her fate.
Nocturnes diligence and hard work at the cloister eventually earned her the position of quartermaster.
