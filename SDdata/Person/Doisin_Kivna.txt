'''Doisin Kivna''' was a [[gnome]] member of the [[Silver Sails Trading Company]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Doisin could often be seen dressed in navy blue finery. He had slightly crossed eyes and appetite for [[coin]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, following the end of the deadly [[Wailing Death]] epidemic, Doisin manned the Silver Sails Trading Company's warehouse in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]]. The gnome supervised arriving and departing cargo as well as offered Silver Sails's goods for sale. Doisin was working at the warehouse when sailors from the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' were stricken by terrifying visions of all-consuming oceans while loading up an ancient statue excavated in the [[Anauroch]].
