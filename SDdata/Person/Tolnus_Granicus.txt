Tolnus Granicus was the guildmaster of the Sandvoyagers Guild. As of the time of the release of Khalitharius in , he had been a captive of a slaver ring for some time.
Tolnus had made all of the genuine records on the Ledger of the Sandvoyagers Guild.
Although abused and tortured, Tolnus had told the slavers nothing. He was reluctant to tell his rescuers much, but would be won over to their cause soon.
Sothal, a slave of the sheik Kassim Arslan, believed strongly that the reason he had not been seen for some time was that he had been a victim of foul play. Another slave working in the kitchen of the Sandvoyagers Guild knew that he had not been just ill, but that he was held captive beneath the guildhall. Though she believed he was held in a cellar, she was otherwise correct.
Tolnus learned that the cultists had wanted to capture the princess because she had some power over an efreet they worshiped, and that they had sought a deal with the slavers because of this. He believed the princess mustve been kept in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak, since the efreet had been raising an army of restless spirits.
