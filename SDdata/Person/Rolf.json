        "mainbody": "guide\nRolf was a guide and later portmaster of Phlan in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThis kind man had blond hair and wore a red shirt and apron.\nCirca 1340 DR, Rolf was appointed by the council of Phlan to accompany newcomers and show them around the city. He greeted a group of adventurers who would become famed across the Realms, and gave them a tour of the main buildings.\nTen years later, circa 1350 DR, he happily reprised his tour for the adventurers arriving in Phlan, even though he had by now achieved the role of portmaster of the city.\nthumb|221x221px|Rolf, ten years later."
