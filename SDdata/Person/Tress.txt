"Tress" (given name unknown) was the owner of the Dragonriders Club in Suzail, Cormyr, in the late 15 century DR.
Tall and urbane, when at work, Tress dressed in leathers that resembled a dragon costume. After the Open Feast, she painted sinuous dragons on her cleavage that became visible when she leaned.
She was sympathetic to fellow servants.
Tress was uncanny in her abilities to know who was who.
Tress kept a chapbook by Flarm about an event from the , which she lent to Amarune Whitewave, one of her dancers, in preparation for the Open Feast.
Though not a dancer, she was in charge of the Dragonriders Club.
Although she was more properly called "mistress", not even the Watch called her anything other than "Tress". and their health.
At the Dragonriders Club in the , Tress personally ushered in Arclath Delcastle and his friends, Halance Tarandar and Belnar Buckmantle, whod come as his guests, and saw them seated and attended to.
Despite this, she later burst into the dancers room, with guards, to find the dancer, Amarune Whitewave, attacking Arclath Delcastle with his own dagger. He claimed quickly that it was a roleplay hed paid for, which reduced the danger to Amarune. Tress brought them some drinks afterwards.
At a later date, Tress was present on the evening when Kathkote Dawntards retinue came to the Dragonriders Club looking for trouble she ran out to find the Watch. She returned, with some improvised weapons, and the Watch in tow, which helped pacify and evict Dawntard and his cronies. After the closure of the club, Tress remained behind to clean up.
On another occasion, Tress, while working in the club, helped up Rorskryn Mreldrake, who was blackout drunk there. He briefly accused Amarune of being the Silent Shadow.
Tress later had to drag Amarune out of bed so she could perform.
