'''Hafiz bin Watat''' was a [[gnome]] [[wizard]] who lived in the [[Sword Coast]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In addition to being a [[spellcaster]], he was also a [[:category:seers|seer]], scientist, and [[astrology|astrologer]].

When Hafiz met [[Gorion's Ward]] in [[1368 DR]], he said that he had met them previously in their dreams. He also offered them some cryptic advice about a [[Sarevok Anchev|future menace]].
