Mosk was a bugbear who worked for Nezznar circa 1491 DR and led the goblinoids under his employ.
The bugbear leader more a jeweled leather eyepatch just for aesthetics, instead of practical purposes, as he had both eyes intact. He also carried 33 sp.
Mosk led the goblinoids that worked towards the Black Spiders cause. He was a given a master key to the complex beneath Tresendar Manor.
In 1491 DR, Nezznar sent Mosk and his contingent of bugbears to Tresendar Manor to keep Iarno Albrek and the Redbrands under control.
