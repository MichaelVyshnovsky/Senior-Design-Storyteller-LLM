'''Grash Crackbacker''' was a slow-witted [[priest]] of [[Bhaal]].

==Description==
A pale-skinned [[half-orc]], Grash dressed in an intricate red-and-black robe. Atop his head rested a golden crown with two red gemstones, and his wide-nosed face bore an aggressive scowl.

==Personality==
Grash had an inclination towards cruelty. He was sorely lacking in intelligence, to the extent that it was considered doubtful he would rise further in the clerical hierarchy of Bhaal.

==Abilities==
Grash possessed incredible strength, which he used to his advantage when employing the "bear hug", his favorite attack.

==Possessions==
Among Grash's possessions were a suit of mundane [[plate mail]], as well as an un[[holy symbol]].
