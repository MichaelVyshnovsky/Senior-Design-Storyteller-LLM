'''Nalva Imthree''' was the high priestess of the [[Church of Chauntea]] in [[Iriaebor]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Nalva was a tiny woman who dedicated her life to growing flowers. She was passionate about good farming and fertility.

She distanced herself from the worldly affairs almost entirely&mdash;the only services she offered the townsfolk was giving out flowers grown in her temple, even in the midst of winter.
