Degasus Tarensun was a minor assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR.
Degasus was born in the Caravan Cities but grew up in Westgate after being abandoned at the citys docks at the age of six. He was adopted by a Night Masks cell that used him as a runner and lookout while teaching him all they knew about living on the streets.
Later, Degasuss natural charisma impressed the wizard Tersonm, who taught him to read, write, and to recognize spells. Degasus made a series of very difficult assassinations and became a rising star assassin among Westgates nobles.
