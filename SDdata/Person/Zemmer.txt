Captain Zemmer was the leader of a mercenary company that served Lord Neverember in the city of Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.
She held a particularly strong hatred for gnolls.
Zemmer owed her Thayan heritage to her father a noted practitioner of necromancy. The two had a great falling out when Zemmer revealed to her father her devotion to Tempus, the Lord of Battles. They wound up never speaking to each other again, as the senior Zemmer was eventually sucked into the Shadowfell.
Growing up she had a zombified dog as a family pet.
While Zemmer led her company as captain, the activities of her father prevented her from ascending the ranks of the military organization.
In the , Captain Zemmer had a number of her soldiers turn against the city, selling their services to the Cult of the Dragon. In response to their lack of loyalty, Zemmer hired some local adventurer to teach the deserters a lesson by means of violence.
To secure better contracts with the city and the Neverwinter Guard, Zemmer hired that same adventurer to destroy her fathers old lab in the Neverdeath graveyard to quell any rumors about his dark past.
