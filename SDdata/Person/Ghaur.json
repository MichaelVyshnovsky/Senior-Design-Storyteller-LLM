        "mainbody": "'''Ghaur''' was a [[goblin]] of the [[Spine of the World]].{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}\n\nNotably, he wielded the [[enchanted]] sword ''[[Namarra]]'', the Sword That Never Sleeps, which the goblins had looted in {{Yearlink|753}}.It is unclear when Ghaur lived. The sources say the goblins had the sword \"for almost two hundred seasons\", but it is unknown if this is meant to be 200 years (''e.g.'', 200 winters) or only 50 years (four seasons per year). Moreover, Namarra's timeline has been stretched by later dating, so it can only be some time before the 1270s DR.\n\nGhaur was killed by [[adventurer]]s of the [[Company of the Gryphon]]. One of those adventurers, a warrior named [[Flar]], claimed Ghaur's sword."
