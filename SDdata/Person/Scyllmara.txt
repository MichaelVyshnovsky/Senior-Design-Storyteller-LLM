Scyllmara was a dragon turtle that dwelled within the flooded ruins of Soorenar in Chessenta. It claimed the flooded city for its lair sometime following the Spellplague, and remained there as of the mid–to–late 15 century DR.
The great dragon turtles presence in the ruined city greatly imperiled any attempts made to recover the immense wealth within.
