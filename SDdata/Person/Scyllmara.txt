'''Scyllmara''' was a [[dragon turtle]] that dwelled within the flooded ruins of [[Soorenar]] in [[Chessenta]]. It claimed the flooded city for its lair sometime following the [[Spellplague]], and remained there as of the mid–to–late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
The great dragon turtle's presence in the ruined city greatly imperiled any attempts made to recover the immense wealth within.
