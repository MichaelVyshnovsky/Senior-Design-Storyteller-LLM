'''Larrel''' was a [[baelnorn]] and former [[elven]] [[archmage]] of great power. He was the founder [[Severed Hand]] fortress in [[Icewind Dale]], that remained there for hundreds of years leading up to the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=IWD">

{{Quote|...free...my...people....astrolabe...whirls...twirls....|Larrel, left incoherent and babbling.<ref name=IWD" />}}

==Description==
In his undead state, Larrel was entirely blind.

==Personality==
He was an exceptionally prideful individual who could not be reasoned with when made up his mind about a situation.<ref name=IWD" />

==Abilities==
Larrel was a powerful archmage that developed his own spells and tapped into magics inaccessible to others. He crafted a ''[[Larrel's sending|unique spell]]'' to project his own image beyond his physical form, and was one of the few beings that could access the powerful [[scrying]] powers of the ''[[Heartstone Gem]]''.<ref name=IWD" />

==Relationships==
Larrel had one known daughter [[Evayne]]. She was loving and loyal elf of the Hand but believe her father irrational at times.<ref name=IWD" />

==History==
===Mortal Life===
In the 10{{th}} century DR, Larrel led his community of [[sun elves]] north to the lands of Icewind Dale. It was there that they founded the fortress known as the Hand of the Seldarine.<ref name=IWD" />

When a great host of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s amassed in [[the North]], Larrel led the elves of the Hand into an alliance with the [[dwarves]] of [[Dorn's Deep]]. Together the two peoples forged new [[artifact]]s of tremendous power, ones marked by the beauty of elven craftsmanship and power of dwarven artisans. This alliance served both peoples well for decades, until a rift appeared between them. [[Human]]s appeared before the alliance requesting to purchase some of their newly-crafted artifacts; the dwarves were amenable to trading with the humans, while Larrel and the elves were not. Despite their disagreement, the dwarves agreed to continue as they had and not open up trade.<ref name=IWD" />

As the allied forces engaged goblin and orc horde, Larrel and his fellow elves were aghast to witness them using those elven-dwarven weapons. Believing the dwarves had broken their agreement, Larrel became entirely irrational, and refused to discuss the situation with dwarven leaders. The distrust that formed between the once-allied people became too much to bear and the alliance was broken.<ref name=IWD" />

The elves of the Hand attempted to hold back the horde of Icewind Dale without their dwarven allies but were ultimately unsuccessful. Larrel's daughter Evayne traveled to Dorn's Deep to plead with the dwarves to re-forge their alliance, but became trapped within the fortress as the horde overwhelmed it. She died during the invasion of Dorn's Deep.<ref name=IWD" />

When the monstrous horde overran the Hand of the Seldarine, Larrel and his fellow [[mage]]s attempted to raise a ''[[mythal]]'' over the imperiled elven fortress. The ritual did not go as planned however. Larrel and the others inadvertently cursed everyone inside the Hand—elves and invaders alike—with the eternal [[undeath]]. For his hubris, Larrel was cursed by the god [[Labelas Enoreth]] as a baelnorn. He was afflicted with a form of madness that left him babbling incoherently, incapable of communicating with others.<ref name=IWD" />

===Existence as a Baelnorn===
{{Quote|For the punishment I suffered for my arrogance and pride, Labelas be damned if he thinks I will forgive them for what they did! I would stay in this cursed form, never to see Arvandor, if it means I could make the dwarves pay for their crime.|Larrel, upon being awakened from his stupor.<ref name=IWD" />}}

Years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, a group of adventurers from [[Easthaven]] ventured into the Severed Hand and worked with [[Gelarith]] to repair and rebuild the room-sized [[astrolabe]] within the [[Labelas Tower]]. Witnessing that great feat restored Larrel's sanity. Larrel agreed to help the adventurers with their quest to investigate the evils that loomed over Icewind Dale. He used the ''Heartstone Gem'' to see that their path led next to Dorn's Deep itself and directed them to its location in the [[Spine of the World]].<ref name=IWD" />

Larrel was not sure why he remained within the ruins of the Severed Hand―as it was then called―but supposed he could put to rest the [[spirit]]s of the elves within and help shepherd them to their [[afterlife]] on [[Arvandor]].<ref name=IWD" />
