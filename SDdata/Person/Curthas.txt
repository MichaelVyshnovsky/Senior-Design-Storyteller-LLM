Curthas was a guard in Glymril Gard during the midâ€“8 century DR.
One of Curthass fellow guards at his post was Halglond. They both served Klandaerlas Glymril.
During the night of the destruction of Glymril Gard late in the ,In the ebook version of Temptation, the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster theyre in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764 DR. Given Feldrins warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. Curthas and Halglond were protecting the bridge between the Masters tower and the keeps battlements. They saw a strange mistlike entity that swept through the air, tinkling with a sound like bells. The entity drew the attention of the Master, who came out with a wand to menace it. Their battle was quick, and the Master died almost on the spot Curthas and Halglond were killed by the ensuing collapse of Glymril Gard, as the Masters spells died with him.
