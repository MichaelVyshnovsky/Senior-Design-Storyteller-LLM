'''Curthas''' was a guard in [[Glymril Gard]] during the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
One of Curthas's fellow guards at his post was [[Halglond]]. They both served [[Klandaerlas Glymril]].

==History==
During the night of the destruction of Glymril Gard late in the {{yearlinkName|764}},In the ebook version of ''Temptation'', the Realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early [[Mirtul]]. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in Part 1 must happen at most during [[Uktar]] of 764 DR. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. Curthas and Halglond were protecting the bridge between the Master's tower and the keep's battlements. They saw a [[Saeraede Lyonora|strange mistlike entity]] that swept through the air, tinkling with a sound like [[bell]]s. The entity drew the attention of the Master, who came out with a wand to menace it. Their battle was quick, and the Master died almost on the spot; Curthas and Halglond were killed by the ensuing collapse of Glymril Gard, as the Master's spells died with him.
