'''Sir Griswald''' was a minor nobleman and a knight from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Despite her unusual story, many knights competed for [[Soliana]]'s hand in marriage. My greatest rival was a young lording named [[Feldran Exeltis]]. That cheating coward poisoned Soliana's mind with lies! He turned her against me and stole her away from Baldur's Gate like a thief in the night!''|Sir Griswald}}

==Description==
Sir Griswald was a distinguished, tall, and lean man with a lush beard and dark eyes.

==Personality==
Sir Griswald was known to be an honorable and kind-hearted man who loved birds and often traveled with his collection of beloved [[songbird]]s.

==Possessions==
One of the most valuable items in Sir Griswald's possession was an [[enchanted]] [[Griswald's belt|belt]] one worn by his grandfather, [[Grisbane the Great]]. Griswald wore the precious item into the siege of the [[Exeltis]] estate and was ready to part with the treasure no save his lover from captivity. Despite his status, Sir Griswald did not have a castle, nor did he have servants. His family rose to prominence through knightly honor.

A small band of mercenaries was led by the noble. They were called the Griswald Knights and were adorned in tattered green colors atop mismatched arms and armor.

Apart from the belt, Sir Griswald wore ''[[gloves of animal handling]]'', ''[[boots of hardiness]]'', and carried a massive ''+1'' enchanted [[greatsword]].

==History==
In the winter of {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Sir Griswald met a kind and enigmatic young woman who had recently arrived in the city of Baldur's Gate. The lady called herself Princess Soliana from the distant land of Fanloc. In reality, Soliana was a naive and romantic young woman, not a princess but the adopted daughter of the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]]. Searching for a grand fairytale romance, Soliana created a story for herself and of her distant wealth and nobility. Several nobles quickly found themselves fascinated with the "princess" competing for her hand in marriage. Two main competitors were Sir Griswald, a noble and honorable knight, and conniving Feldran Exeltis, who lusted after the woman's wealth. Young Exeltis tricked Griswald into venturing away from the Gate and quickly swept in and convinced the gullible young woman that Sir Griswald abandoned Soliana, leaving for the [[Moonshae Isles]] for good. Feldran lured Soliana to his family's holding â€“ [[Castle Exeltis]] on the [[Blade Cliffs]] outside the city of [[Daggerford]], where she became unknowingly imprisoned. When Sir Griswald discovered his beloved gone, he assembled his family's mercenaries and laid siege on Castle Exeltis but could not cross the cliffside moat. Lord Exeltis informed Griswald that Soliana loved him not and did not wish to see him. The honorable knight refused to believe the outrageous lie and demanded "princess" to tell it to his face. Desperate for help and growing overwhelmed with despair, Griswald sent his page to fetch a hero was recently gifted holdings in the town of [[Liam's Hold]].

Soliana fell in love with Griswald in the spring of {{YearlinkName|1372}}, but with his perceived abandonment, she gave into young Exeltis' affections. Soliana did not realize she was in captivity as she trusted Feldran because of his wealth, education, and promise to teach her to be truly noble, like in the fairytales her mother told her. When Sir Griswald started the siege, Feldran Exeltis announced that a monstrous barbarian horde was outside the castle moat and locked the "princess" in her tower "for her own safety."

Sir Griswald implored the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to sneak into the impregnable castle and lower the drawbridge, allowing the Griswald Knights to storm the stronghold. Even though it was unknown if the Hero was successful, some stories claimed that he managed to sneak inside the castle through old sewer cavers underneath the cliffside castle. If that were true, Sir Griswald was sure to have had confronted the Exeltis lordling putting an end to his life, and reuniting with his beloved.
