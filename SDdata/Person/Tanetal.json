        "mainbody": "'''Tanetal''' was a [[pit fiend]] and servant of [[Bane]].",
        "History": "In the [[1350 DR|Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR]], Tanetal was ordered by Bane into the service of the [[Red Wizard]] [[Marcus]] in order to aid him in his task of bringing more power to the dark god by sacrificing [[human]] souls to the ''[[pool of darkness]]''. Vastly more competent than his nominal master, Tanetal was used as a scapegoat by Marcus. Even though he brought power to the wizard and brought thousands of troops into his service, Tanetal was stymied by the inept wizard.\n\nEventually, Tanetal assumed the form of the human [[bard]] '''\"Latenat\"''' in an effort to convince the people of [[Phlan]] to abandon the stolen city and leave the safety they enjoyed there. His plot almost succeeded until Marcus summoned him to his defense at a most inopportune moment.\n\n[[Evaine]] finally managed to banish him to the [[Nine Hells]] by figuring out his true name.",
        "Trivia": "Tanetal had a habit of saying \"Latenat\" at the beginning or end of his speech."
