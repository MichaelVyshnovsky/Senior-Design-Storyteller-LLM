Durvastra was a cloud giant who met an untimely end in the depths of Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR.
During the operation of the Wheloon Prison, the ruthless Night Brigade gang enjoyed a period of ascendency above other gangs. One of their officers, Agarta the Breaker, operated a series of arenas where gladiatorial beasts and prisoners were pitted against each other. She was more than willing to spend big to fulfil the bloodlust of both the crowds and herself, and had more exotic creatures and people smuggled into the prison so that they could be used in her bloodsports. The most extraordinary of her prizes was the cloud giant Durvastra, who was somehow kidnapped and smuggled into the prison, where he served as a champion gladiator for some time. Unable to escape his Night Brigade captors, he became resigned to his fate and crushed any contestants he was placed against. This grim winning streak was ended when the Riverside Rats gang sent a team into the prison to fight the Night Brigade, eventually meeting Durvastra in his arena and slaying him and Agarta as well.
