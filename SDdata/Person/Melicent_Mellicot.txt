'''Melicent Mellicot''' was a woman of the [[village]] of [[Swords Pool (village)|Swords Pool]] in [[the Vast]] in [[1370 DR]].

Melicent was a member of the [[Mellicot]] family, and sister to [[Meliors Mellicot|Meliors]] and [[Melusine Mellicot|Melusine]]. Together, the three sisters owned the [[Inn of the Nine Swords]], a high-quality establishment.

The Mellicot sisters stocked the pond of [[Swords Pool (pool)|Swords Pool]] with [[trout]] and a type of fish they called "[[manyfins]]". They discouraged fishing, but some people did it anyway on dark nights.
