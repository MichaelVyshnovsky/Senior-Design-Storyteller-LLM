'''Pheldred''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the mid-14{{th}} century.

==Description==
For a long time, his arms kept changing into [[manacles]]. He had dark hair and glittering black eyes.

==Abilities==
During his duel with [[Aumlar Chaunthoun]], Pheldred cast a number of spells, including one which launched a shimmering sword, one which created an advancing strip of drifting silver sparks, apparently called ''deathwall'', and another of his spells generated a spiraling silver energy that closed around its target, with unknown effects; the spiral was vulnerable to some wands. He used some manner of shieldings, which blocked numerous spells from wands, but worked ablatively, being slowly worn down by volume. Some of his shieldings could be made to expand and turn away magic. Another of his spells drank the power from spells around him and even wands, powering new spellblades with them.

==Relationships==
He sought revenge against Aumlar Chaunthoun, a [[Zhentarim]] mage.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|310|18}} [[Korthauvar Hammantle]] and [[Hlael Toraunt]] were aware of him and his history.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|271|16}}

==Possessions==
He wore two rings, dark maroon robes, and a richly made belt, in which he held two daggers and a whip.

==History==
Pheldred had been cursed at some point by Aumlar Chaunthoun, so that his arms kept changing into manacles. He spent some years with this handicap, until he was finally able to find the names by which he could command the [[fiend]] into which Aumlar Chathoun had bound the curse. The Zhentarim knew he'd managed to slip out of too many deadly situations unscathed.

In late {{yearlink|1357}}, Pheldred ambushed Aumlar Chaunthoun, who was undercover in a caravan under [[Orthil Voldovan]], en route from [[Scornubel]] to [[Triel]], on the way to [[Waterdeep]]. He was eventually overmatched and forced to flee.
