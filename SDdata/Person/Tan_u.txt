Tanu was a butu "warrior", better described as a rogue, that hailed from the Courage tribe of the Malatran Plateau and the slopes of the Fire Mountain, active in the late 14 century DR.
Tanu was a boastful man, but it was just a cover for his fearfulness.
In the late 14 century DR, the Tribe of the Wise Ones became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Tanu was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with Temenu Farseer of the Wise Ones, caimian katanga Roq Silent Hunter, tamhi Allanna, and Koshiva tribesman named Green Spirit. Tanus group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced hunting spider katangas who guarded previously captured adventurers.
It was unknown if Tanu survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing.
