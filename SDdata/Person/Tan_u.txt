'''Tan'u''' was a [[butu]] "warrior", better described as a [[rogue]], that hailed from the [[Courage tribe]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] and the slopes of the [[Fire Mountain]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Tan'u was a boastful man, but it was just a cover for his fearfulness.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the [[Fire Mountain]]. Tan'u was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with [[Temenu Farseer]] of the [[Wise Ones]], [[caimian katanga]] [[Roq Silent Hunter]], [[tam'hi]] [[Allanna]], and [[Koshiva]] tribesman named [[Green Spirit]]. Tan'u's group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced [[hunting spider katanga]]s who guarded previously captured adventurers.

It was unknown if Tan'u survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the [[Village of the Wise Ones]] for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.
