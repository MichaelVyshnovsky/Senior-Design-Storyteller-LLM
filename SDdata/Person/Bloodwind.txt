==History==
In [[1491 DR]], after his fellow cultists infiltrated the monastery, Bloodwind went there to commence an elemental ritual. He dismissed the local cultist leader.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|5}} He and his [[genasi]] assistants arrived at the monastery disguised as a group of sages{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|33-34}} and established themselves at the [[Tower of the Winds]]. There they started the ritual, generating a strange storm around the monastery.

At last, thanks to [[Lana]]'s report, an adventuring party hired by the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], the [[Lords' Alliance]], and Zor [[Garwyl Gos]] of [[Mulmaster]] stopped the ritual and defeated him.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|46-47}}
