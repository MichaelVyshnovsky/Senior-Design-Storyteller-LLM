Bloodwind was a high-member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
In 1491 DR, after his fellow cultists infiltrated the monastery, Bloodwind went there to commence an elemental ritual. He dismissed the local cultist leader. He and his genasi assistants arrived at the monastery disguised as a group of sages and established themselves at the Tower of the Winds. There they started the ritual, generating a strange storm around the monastery.
At last, thanks to Lanas report, an adventuring party hired by the Order of the Gauntlet, the Lords Alliance, and Zor Garwyl Gos of Mulmaster stopped the ritual and defeated him.
