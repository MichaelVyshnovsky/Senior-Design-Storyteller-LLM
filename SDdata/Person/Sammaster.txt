'''Sammaster''' was an immensely powerful [[human]] [[mage]] and a former [[Chosen of Mystra]]. Sammaster was known for founding the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and discovering the process that turns a [[dragon]] into a [[dracolich]]. After being killed in a great battle, he returned several hundred years later as a [[lich]], but was destroyed once more.{{Fact}}
{{quote|Back to your graves...|Sammaster to an army of undead.}}

==Description==
Sammaster was a tall handsome man with dark brown hair. His hair was usually long and straight. Mnethos recorded him, around 817 DR, as tall and thin to the point of being gaunt, with a nervous, excitable disposition, and a pale complexion. He had large, "somber" brown eyes.

==Personality==
Mnethos noted, around 817 DR, that Sammaster had a nervous, excitable disposition, with acute senses that often led to his agitation. He had an "uneasy stomach" and was ill often, from coughing, sneezing, and difficulty breathing, for which he received herbal treatments.

He described Sammaster as a quick study, having a fierce intellect, and Sammaster would often miss meals or sleep in order to fulfil his driving ambition to learn and master the art of magic.

==Abilities==
[[File:Elminster vs sammaster.jpg|thumb|''Sammaster's spellbattle with Elminster.''|550x550px]]
In the  course of his final battle, despite being caught largely unprepared, Sammaster proved to have a tarnished silver ring, which he could use to call on a host of planar dragons, including ''[[hellfire wyrm]]s'', ''[[howling dragon]]s'', ''[[pyroclastic dragon]]s'',{{cite book/The Ruin|289|12}} and ''[[chaos dragon]]s''{{cite book/The Ruin|290|12}} as well as [[abyssal drake]]s.{{cite book/The Ruin|297|13}} He could call those dragons with his spells, and he also had a number of other, more specific spells, including ''[[fleshshiver]]'',{{cite book/The Ruin|293|13}} ''[[flesh to stone]]'' and ''[[backblast]]''.{{cite book/The Ruin|294|13}} He also knew ''[[flensing]]'', ''[[acid rain]]'', and ''[[black blade of disaster]]''.{{cite book/The Ruin|309|13}} He also knew a spell to create dozens of shadow jaws to attack a target.{{cite book/The Ruin|316|13}} Another spell, ''[[Power word, kill]]'', was almost certainly in his repertoire.{{cite book/The Ruin|318|13}} He also knew a shapeshifting spell, almost certainly ''[[shapechange]]''.{{cite book/The Ruin|322|13}} Finally, he knew at least one spell that teleported him a short distance. Another of his spells, likely ''[[Ghorus Toth's metal melt]]'', could destroy magic items, splashing their metal parts around.{{cite book/The Ruin|329|13}}

One of his spells granted him invisibility, and many were wards concentrated on a spot rather than on himself.{{cite book/The Ruin|308|13}} One of those wards created concentric spheres that attacked anyone intersected with them; at least one of these spheres blocked breath weapons. The spheres could also be willed to expand, so as to attack those who stood within their possible range.{{cite book/The Ruin|308-309|13}} These wards also generated a variety of effects, blocking people in ''[[gaseous form]]'', passing through the [[ethereal plane]], and even ''[[teleportation]]'', going so far as to harm those who attempted as much.{{cite book/The Ruin|311|13}} Those who penetrated the concentric spheres were subject to ever greater torments and damage.{{cite book/The Ruin|317|13}}

He could create traps that caused tumors to grow inside people, which resonated with external energies to afflict even the most warded person, in a manner akin to the ''[[necrotic cyst]]'' spell.{{cite book/The Ruin|328|13}} He had also extensive knowledge of construct crafting, allowing him to build [[dragonbone golem]]s,{{cite book/The Ruin|173|7}} [[drakestone golem]]s, and [[ironwyrm golem]]s.{{cite book/The Ruin|324|13}}

==Possessions ==
As of 851 DR, Sammaster possessed a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of free action]]'', and ''[[boots of striding]]'' and ''[[boots of springing|springing]]''.

By 855 DR, Sammaster had acquired a ''[[Robe of the archmagi]]'' and a ''[[staff of the magi]]''.

By 905 DR, Sammaster possessed a ''[[staff of power]]'', a ''[[ring of human influence]]'', a ''[[ring of wizardry]]'', ''[[potion of evil dragon control|potions of evil dragon control]]'', a ''[[pearl of power]]'', and ''[[wings of flying]]''.

==History==
===Early Life===
Sammaster was born in [[800 DR]],Most sources give the date as 800 DR, but ''Cult of the Dragon'' p. 7 notes that the exact date is lost, but that is it on or near 800 DR. and not much has been discovered about his early life. He might have been born in [[Sembia]], the [[Dalelands]], or the [[North Faerûn|North]]. It is believed that his parents were killed, circumstances unknown, when Sammaster was still very young. His father is said to have been a nobleman, a [[necromancer]], or a pirate. His mother is said to have been a [[fiend]] from another plane, an escaped slave, a [[wood nymph]], a priestess from [[Mulhorand]], or an incarnation of [[Sharess]].

It is believed that after his parents' deaths, Sammaster was raised by relatives or friends, but that his life was not pleasant, contributing to his behaviours later in life.

===Apprenticeship===
At age 17, Sammaster was taken on as an apprentice by a traveling mage named [[Mnethos]]. During this period, Mnethos visited [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Berdusk]], [[Iriaebor]], [[Marsember]], [[Nimoar's Hold]], [[Saerloon]], [[Scornubel]], [[Silverymoon]] and [[Yartar]]. Not long into his training, Sammaster was introduced to the goddess [[Mystra]], whom he soon began worshiping.

After just 8 years under the guidance of Mnethos, Sammaster had learnt all he could and began a path of his own.

===Journeyman ===
Sammaster traveled a lot during this period following his apprenticeship, and his own eccentricities led to chaotic behaviour. He is believed to have had many relationships and possibly borne children, but there is no record of who these individuals are.

Prior to the age of 40 (prior to 840 DR), Sammaster had discovered, rediscovered, or improved a number of spells, including ''[[lower resistance]]'' and ''[[squaring the circle]]'', and had advanced knowledge of [[metamagic]]. He began to refer to [[Mystra]] as the "Mother of All Magic".

===Chosen of Mystra ===
Not long after, he began traveling [[Faerûn]] in search of knowledge and wisdom. During this time he made numerous advancements in [[metamagic]] through detailed research.

In [[851 DR]] the goddess Mystra appeared to Sammaster in the [[Dalelands]], not far from [[Myth Drannor]], Sammaster fell to his knees and wept upon Mystra's feet. They ended up spending ten days together. This made him the first Chosen of Mystra since the [[Seven Sisters]]. When he asked for the reason that Mystra had chosen him, she replied that she had foreseen that one of her Chosen would be killed in battle, and he would be the replacement. He left this encounter feeling as though he and Mystra were in love.

===Elminster===
Sammaster began meeting regularly with [[Elminster]], in order to understand his new powers. Although both archmages worked together and Sammaster learnt from Elminster, the two did not get along well, as their personalities grated on each other, and Elminster repeatedly pointed out that Mystra's true love was [[Azuth]], not Sammaster.

During one lesson with Elminster, Sammaster had to defeat an army of undead without destroying a single monster. He was instructed to force them to return to where they had come from. Although he struggled at first, he ultimately succeeded. Mystra appeared to Elminster shortly after this, and Elminster expressed his distaste at having to "forge" Sammaster, but Mystra reassured him that it was something that must be done.

=== Turning point===
A few years later, Sammaster began researching the processes of life, death and [[undeath]]. This research lasted several years and resulted in the creation of several original [[necromancy|necromantic]] enchantments.

Sammaster encountered a [[Zhent]] caravan between [[Cormyr]] and the Dalelands, and saw that they were keeping slaves in cages. He engaged the Zhent forces, but when they began killing prisoners, he flew into a rage. He killed many of the Zhent, but his magic also killed many of the prisoners, and his psyche could not cope with having committed this act. He continued until he had killed all of the Zhent forces, but the prisoners were in a state of panic, many still confined, causing them further injury, and many would not leave their cages for fear of Sammaster.

Sammaster was rendered unconscious from the exertion, but a [[Harper]] was present at this event, and carried him away to safety, giving him a place to camp, as well as food and water. The news of this event reached the Master Harpers, as well as [[Storm Silverhand]] and Elminster, who chose to do nothing about it. This single event is widely attributed as turning Sammaster mad, and turning him towards evil.

===The "Dark Path"===
Sammaster went on to learn to command and reanimate the innocent dead, forming relationships with [[vampire]]s and [[lich]]es. Mystra was only concerned with his furthering of the theories of magic, and did not prevent him from deeds perceived as evil. This is within Mystra's character as a much more neutral deity of the time, unlike the form she assumed later.

In 861 DR, after ending his research, Sammaster once again began traveling Faerûn. On his travels he met and began a relationship with another Chosen of Mystra, [[Alustriel Silverhand]], who had been leader of [[Silverymoon]] since [[857 DR]]. Sammaster's interest in Alustriel was to dominate and master her, and to unravel her secrets. The relationship lasted for a few years, but it came to an end, Alustriel particularly disturbed by Sammaster's interest in necromancy, and Sammaster's emotional and mental well-being were permanently damaged.

===Later life ===
Sammaster soon met and befriended [[Algashon Nathaire]], in or around the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Algashon was a mage and dedicated priest of [[Bane]] (Mystra's enemy). For the next few years the two mages traveled far and wide together, Sammaster converting to worship Bane, and Algashon, seeing an opportunity to create a powerful tyrant, slowly turned Sammaster more bitter, resentful and evil.

Algashon began to instil in Sammaster the idea that all of his recent failings had been the fault of others, including the battle with the Zhents, and his relationship with Alustriel. He also began to encourage Sammaster to use his ''[[silver fire]]'' as much as possible, so that he could study it, for the benefit of Bane. Sammaster began to believe that all of his problems had began when he accepted his role as Chosen of Mystra.

By [[875 DR]] Algashon had convinced Sammaster to attack his former lover, Alustriel, in the [[Evermoors]]. Algashon aimed to steal Alustriel's ''silver fire'' rather than kill Sammaster to gain his. Although wounded by Sammaster's initial assault, Alustriel survived and summoned two more Chosen, [[Khelben Arunsun]] and [[Laeral Silverhand]], to help her. In the ensuing battle, Sammaster was stripped of his Chosen powers by Mystra and would have been killed if not for Algashon. The battle destroyed what was left of Sammaster's sanity and from that point on, he fully embraced [[evil]]. He was also still in possession of limited powers of the Chosen of Mystra: the ability to heal very rapidly, and to avoid aging.

He soon began translating ancient prophecies and distributing his findings, most notably his translations from the ancient text, [[Maglas]]'s ''[[Chronicle of Years to Come]]'', in [[887 DR]]. The validity of these translations is highly speculated, and it is suspected that they were just a means for him to promote his new ideals. From his research he quickly became convinced that 'dead dragons' would one day rule over Toril. This belief became known as the ''Scaly Way''.

===Cult of the Dragon===
In [[902 DR]], having set up in [[Saerloon|Chondathan]] (later to be renamed Saerloon) with Algashon and their followers, Sammaster successfully created the first Cult [[dracolich]], named [[Shargrailar]]. He was not the first to undergo the transformation, but was the first known to have survived it. He compiled accounts of the rituals and components necessary to create a dracolich in a book entitled ''[[Tome of the Dragon]]''. This holy relic is still used by the many members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to raise their own dracolich allies.

By [[905 DR]] Sammaster finished his principal work on the ''Tome of the Dragon'', and copies started appearing all over Faerûn. His philosophy and beliefs of the Cult of the Dragon also began spreading across Faerûn, and it was at this time that the name "Cult of the Dragon" became widely adopted.

The Cult began to spread from Chondathan and soon attracted enemies such as the [[Harpers]]. When they demanded protection money for Zhent caravans, they made enemies of [[Zhentil Keep]], and the dracolich Shargrailar began to raid Zhent caravans between [[Shadow Gap]] and the [[River Tesh]]. This led to an influx of wealth for the Cult, and Sammaster went on to create more dracoliches in the following years.

===Death===
In the {{YearlinkName|916}}, Sammaster and a group of his followers were traveling to visit two [[green dragon]]s in southern Cormanthyr, in order to convince them to become dracoliches. However they were ambushed by the [[Harper]]s and [[church of Lathander|clergy of Lathander]] near [[Hap]]. Algashon had prior knowledge of this ambush but, instead of letting Sammaster know, he made plans to be far from the scene. A battle broke out and Sammaster was forced to fight an [[avatar]] of the god [[Lathander]] himself. During the chaos Sammaster was killed and seemingly obliterated. It also generated a holy relic of Lathander known as the ''[[Blood of Lathander]]''.

===Adenthia===
{{quote|''Is this the disparity between mortals and deities? They seize the supreme authority, whilst I'm merely an insect squashed under foot? Are you content with this, Elminster? I am not! My fate shall be my own!''|''Sammaster to Elminster''}}
[[File:Elminster vs Sammaster DHSG.png|thumb|350px|right|''Elminster finally confronting Sammaster in spell-battle on the far-off world of Adenthia.'']]
At some point after his death, Sammaster somehow resurrected himself on the far-off world of [[Adenthia]], where he hoped to use necromancy and chaos power, a local form of magic, to achieve a chaotic state between life and death without the need for a phylactery for himself and his newly created dracoliches. After seeing his early experiments, a local cult called Penultima found Sammaster and proclaimed him to be their long-dead Child of Chaos, who'd also raised undead dragons and was involved in a Dragon Rage, and Sammaster came to believe it himself. They venerated him and shared with him the Child of Chaos's magical techniques and he turned them into a kind of Cult of the Dragon cell, sharing with copies of the ''Tome of the Dragon'' and Cult of the Dragon rituals. However, the new dracoliches were unstable, prone to madness, rage, and spontaneous disintegration, likely due to the chaos power and the use of long-dead dragon bones originating in the Dragon Rage. They continued creating dracoliches whilst they tried to stabilize the process and sought to conquer Adenthia. [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] sent [[Elminster]] to Adenthia to investigate the "diminished" dracoliches terrorizing its southern lands; Elminster suspected that world's chaos power was infecting her own magic. Elminster enlisted the aid of a local adventurer, [[Gerana]], and they tracked the dracoliches to the cult, before Sammaster summoned them to their fortress. Elminster confronted Sammaster, who railed against Mystra withdrawing his powers and Lathander obliterating, and against gods in general for holding authority and power over him. He desired to control his own fate and wield the powers of a god himself. Ultimately, they fought and Elminster and Gerana once again destroyed Sammaster in a lengthy battle, though Elminster feared he would eventually return through his magic.<ref group="note">In ''Dragonheir'', Sammaster talks about his battle with Lathander and his death as though it was recent, rather than one of his later destructions as a lich. Moreover, he appears to be a living human, not an undead lich. Therefore, this is presumed to occur in the three-century-long period between his death and his return as a lich. ''Cult of the Dragon'' pp. 19–20 discusses how his phylactery and remains were passed through numerous hands for much of this time before he returned as a lich, leaving ample opportunity for his Adenthian misadventure.

===Resurrection and Destruction===
336 years later in [[1282 DR]], a lich calling itself Sammaster was found in the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]]. The creature began forming an army from humanoids, undead, and dragons.

In [[1285 DR]] an adventuring group of paladins known as the [[Company of Twelve]] attacked Sammaster's stronghold. Of the twelve, nine were killed, but the lich's physical form was destroyed. The survivors confirmed that this creature was in fact Sammaster.

Almost another one-hundred years later in [[1373 DR]] Sammaster completed his transformation of the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]'' binding his [[phylactery]] within. This precipitated a [[Rage of Dragons]] independent of the [[King-Killer Star]].<ref>

Under the alias of the [[Zhengyi|Witch-King]] reborn, Sammaster then raised an army of [[orc]]s and giants in [[Vaasa]]. The army took the [[Bloodstone]] gates and flooded into [[Damara]]. Within the year, despite his immense power, Sammaster was destroyed along with his phylactery, and the Rage came to an end.
