Jlacathra Vorn was a powerful sorceress in ancient Myth Drannor.
Jlacathra was one of the most powerful mages of the city before its fall. However, during the Weeping War, believing it impossible that some fiends could cause the ruination of the city, she disappeared from the war. Instead, she focused on creating a very powerful spell together with the Circle of the Flame cabal. At the moment of the Myth Drannors fall, Jlacathra was planewalking and nobody saw her again.
However, some time after the citys fall, the Circle of Swords became operative. The magic was kept in the custody of a unique magical construct, the Floating Face.
In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, somehow the magic activated, calling to it some adventurers via their dreams.
