'''Jlacathra Vorn''' was a powerful [[sorceress]] in ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Jlacathra was one of the most powerful mages of the city before its fall. However, during the [[Weeping War]], believing it impossible that some [[fiend]]s could cause the ruination of the city, she disappeared from the war. Instead, she focused on creating a very powerful [[spell]] together with the [[Circle of the Flame]] cabal. At the moment of the Myth Drannor's fall, Jlacathra was [[planewalker|planewalking]] and nobody saw her again.

However, some time after the city's fall, the [[Circle of Swords]] became operative. The magic was kept in the custody of a unique magical [[construct]], the [[Floating Face]].

In the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], somehow the magic activated, calling to it some adventurers via their dreams.
