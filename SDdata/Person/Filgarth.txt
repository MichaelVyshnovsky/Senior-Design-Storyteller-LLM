'''Filgarth''' was a former warrior from [[Tethyr]] who enjoyed retirement on an isolated farm in the kingdom's countryside during the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
In his later years, Filgarth rarely if ever spoke. If he did, he would have revealed an entirely toothless mouth. His arms and face were laced with scars, received from his years in battle.

==History==
For a few months in the {{YearlinkName|1468}}, Filgarth watched over [[Evonne Linde]]'s children, [[Teague Linden|Teague]] and [[Ysabel Linden|Ysabel]], following the death of their father [[Garion Linden]]. He then took them back to their mother's home in [[Darromar]], about a [[tenday]] before the coronation of Queen [[Anais Rhindaun]].
