In his later years, Filgarth rarely if ever spoke. If he did, he would have revealed an entirely toothless mouth. His arms and face were laced with scars, received from his years in battle.
For a few months in the , Filgarth watched over Evonne Lindes children, Teague and Ysabel, following the death of their father Garion Linden. He then took them back to their mothers home in Darromar, about a tenday before the coronation of Queen Anais Rhindaun.
