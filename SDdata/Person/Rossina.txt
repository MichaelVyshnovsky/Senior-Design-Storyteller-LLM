==Description==
Rossina was a [[forest gnome]] with a pale skin tone, icy blue eyes, and long straight brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Rossina and several other citizens of Baldur's Gate were randomly attacked by a gang [[sahuagin]] who emerged from the [[Gray Harbor]] as Rossina was strolling along the shore. Serendipitously, a band of adventurers known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]] were nearby as the attack commenced.
