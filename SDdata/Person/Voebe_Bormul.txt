Lady '''Voebe Bormul''' was a member of the noble [[patriar]] [[Bormul]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] sometime before or in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lady [[Allice Bormul]] became a prisoner of the secret [[Sharran]] cloister below the [[House of Grief]] of Baldur's Gate. She was incarcerated in the Chamber of Loss and died before ever seeing freedom. Allice died holing her ''Last Will and Testament'', written in her own blood, leaving possessions to her beloved daughter, Voebe Bormul. Her skeletal remains and the will were still within the undergoing cloister during the [[Absolute crisis]].
