        "mainbody": "'''Imrae''' was a handmaiden of [[Lolth]] who lived in [[Ust Natha]] around [[1368 DR]].",
        "Description": "She was a typical female [[drow]], cruel and ruthless. She would get maddened if spoken to by a male without permission. Imrae believed that foreigners had no place in Ust Natha, and would usually sell them to slavers, or to the [[Ust Natha tavern|tavern]] for amusement. The handmaiden gave [[Solaufein]] a blessed item of Lolth that would pull [[illithids]] from their astral travels.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], she may have assigned both Solaufein and the party of [[Gorion's Ward]] to intercept a group of mind flayers who had captured a [[matron mother]]'s daughter, called [[Phaere Despana|Phaere]]."
