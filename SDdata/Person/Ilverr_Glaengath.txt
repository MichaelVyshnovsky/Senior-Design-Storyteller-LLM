'''Ilverr Glaengath''' was one of the founding members of the [[Great Goblet]] crime syndicate in [[Scornubel]]. ''Circa'' the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], he was the unofficial leader of the organization.

==Description==
Ilverr was the oldest member of the cabal, with white hair and facial lines sculpted by many years on the road. Even though he was short and burly, his posture and mannerisms immediately gave the impression of aristocracy or of someone in authority.

==Personality==
Glaengath was an astute businessman and leader. He commanded respect from his associates and some also feared him. By all appearances, he did not seek power or prestige for himself within the inner circle of the Great Goblet, but seemed to have the safety of the Lords of the Goblet as his first priority. Because of this, the other Lords allowed him to chair meetings and take the lead on most of the cabal's efforts.

==Possessions==
Ilverr was wealthy by most standards. He had offices and residences in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep]], [[Elturel]], and his hometown of Scornubel. He loved [[horse]]s and, by the 1370s DR, he owned some stables and breeding farms and their herds.

Each of the Lords was in possession of a [[gold]]en goblet that contained a finger or toe that once belonged to [[Halonidas Dreie]] (whose assassination marked the founding of the Great Goblet) as a reminder and warning against treachery.

==Activities==
Ilverr made his fortune as and was primarily known as a textile merchant that dealt in rugs and window drapes. He loved to ride horses and expanded this passion into the business of breeding and selling them. He started out trying to become the supplier for many mercenary companies in the region, but was aiming to become a major supplier of warhorses for [[Amn]], [[Cormyr]], and [[Tethyr]].
