Wolmad Eaglewing, or the self-appointed Lord of the Vale, was the acting war-leader of the Sky Pony Tribe of Uthgardt barbarians living on the northern side of the Nether Mountains. He harbored a deep grudge against the dwarves, especially those from Citadel Felbarr.
Wolmad was known as a reckless but charismatic leader.
Sometime around 1372 DR, War-leader Wolmad usurped power from the dying chieftain and led the Sky Ponies in a campaign of banditry in Old Delzoun. He singled out the dwarves of the region, often raiding their passing caravans.
After years of fighting with the orcs of the Nether and Rauvin Mountains, Wolmad developed a twisted sense of ownership of the valleys between and demanded monetary tribute for anyone passing through what he referred to as "his lands".
