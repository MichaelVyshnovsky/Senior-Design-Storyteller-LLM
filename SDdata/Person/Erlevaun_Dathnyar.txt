'''Erlevaun Dathnyar''' was a [[moon elf]] [[wizard]] from [[Evereska]], murdered in [[1348 DR]] by [[Horaundoon]], the Eater-of-[[Mantle (spell)|Mantles]].

==History==
Erlevaun Dathnyar was a spell-caster of average prowess among the elves of Evereska. He used his magic to flatten rocks in his garden into pleasant and appealing forms of waves and swirls with glowing beautiful [[moonflower]]s planted in them. The garden was the first place Erlevaun created after his arrival to the Hidden Realms and since then, the wizard could often be found there, lingering and musing. His death came in 1348 DR, when Erlevaun's spell ''mantle'' was affected by Horaundoon's magics. The [[Zhentarim]] agent developed a unique spell that allowed him to steal arcane spells and knowledge via ''mantles'', incinerating the target in the process.
