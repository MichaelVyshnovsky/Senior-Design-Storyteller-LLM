The Shepherd of the Damned was a unique devil that delighted in converting the most ineffectual and vulnerable people into zealous followers of a terrible cause.
Her red skin continually burned with bright orange-red flames.
She wielded a fiendish sword and kite shield in battle.
The Shepherd was a long-time ally of the succubus Rohini.
Circa the , the Shepherd of the Damned joined Rohini on Toril during the succubus-prophets occupation of Helms Hold. Rohini enlisted her ally to convert the lowly creatures that dwelled within the citys underground Warrens, and bring them over to the cause of the Ashmadai.
That same year the Shepherd was slain by an adventurer dispatched from the city Neverwinter, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge.
