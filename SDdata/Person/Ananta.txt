'''Ananta''' was a [[dragonborn]] who served as the Guardian of [[Dracowyr]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Abilities==
Ananta was able to breathe acid.

==Equipment==
Ananta possessed a powerful magical [[staff]] granted to her by the [[dragon]] [[Princes of Murghôm]]. It gave her access to [[spell]]s powerful enough to subdue any dragon and enhanced her acid breath.

==History==
Ananta was rescued from a presumably nasty fate by the [[blue dragon]] [[Skalnaedyr (dragon)|Skalnaedyr]], and she swore fealty to him ever since. Skalnaedyr made her Guardian of Dracowyr.

In 1479 DR, she fought and lost against the [[vampiric dragon|vampiric]] [[smoke drake]] [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] when he appeared to parlay with the princes of Murghôm. However, he allowed her to live with the condition that she helped him to contact Skalnaedyr.

Ananta was released from her service to Brimstone when the vampire dispelled the magic that bounded dragons to play ''xorvintaal''.
