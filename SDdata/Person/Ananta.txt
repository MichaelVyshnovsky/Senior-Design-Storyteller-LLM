Ananta was a dragonborn who served as the Guardian of Dracowyr in 1479 DR.
Ananta was able to breathe acid.
Ananta possessed a powerful magical staff granted to her by the dragon Princes of Murghôm. It gave her access to spells powerful enough to subdue any dragon and enhanced her acid breath.
Ananta was rescued from a presumably nasty fate by the blue dragon Skalnaedyr, and she swore fealty to him ever since. Skalnaedyr made her Guardian of Dracowyr.
In 1479 DR, she fought and lost against the vampiric smoke drake Brimstone when he appeared to parlay with the princes of Murghôm. However, he allowed her to live with the condition that she helped him to contact Skalnaedyr.
Ananta was released from her service to Brimstone when the vampire dispelled the magic that bounded dragons to play xorvintaal.
