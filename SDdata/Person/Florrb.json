        "mainbody": "Florbb was the mud mephit who \"ruled over\" the Mud Pits of Florrb on the Snout of Omgar during the late 15 century DR.\nDue to the circumstances in which he found himself, Florbb was extremely anxious.\nFlorbb spent much of his time attracting and encouraging tortles to bathe in muddy pits, hoping they would trigger some magical effect.\nCenturies before the Second Sundering, Florbb and two other mud mephits were transported from their home in the Elemental Plane of Earth to the Mud Pits on Toril. While Florbbs companions were able to return home by playing in the mud of their new surroundings, Florbb was not so lucky. He spent decades upon decades trying to return to his friends."
