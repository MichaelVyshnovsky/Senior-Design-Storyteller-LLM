The Watcher, or He Who Watches and Waits, was a yikarian inhabiting the body of Makin al-Mutrattab in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Watcher was extremely patient and cautious, making him the perfect fit for a spy within the Court of Enlightenment.
The Watcher possessed Makins body after he was subdued and kidnapped by a pair of earthservants working for the Unspeakable. The Watcher gained access to all of Makins memories, and used his position as the Grand Caliphs favorite cousin to learn vital information about the royal family. The Watcher reported everything he learned by communicating telepathically with the Unspeakable.
