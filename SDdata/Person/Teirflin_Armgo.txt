Teirflin Armgo was the son of Sinnafain and Tosun Armgo.
Teirflin kept his head shaved. He fought with two swords.
In 1484 DR, Teirflin and his sister Doumwielle Armgo held a duel to see who would inherit their fathers sentient sword, Khazidhea. Doumwielle won the duel by using a spell, which Teirflin considered cheating. Enraged and fueled on by the swords psychic intrusions, Teirflin stole Khazidhea and tried to kill Doumwielle with it as she slept. She awoke and managed to wrest the sword from his hands, but, at the urging of the sword, impaled her brother.
