'''Ollarent Hillgreen''' was the assistant to [[Old Night]] [[Shalara Swordshigh]] at the main library of the [[Heralds of Faerûn]], known as [[Herald's Holdfast]], around the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].

He was the senior sage in charge of the Library of Man. He fiercely guarded the knowledge under his care and would only give secrets away if directed by Old Night. He required a trade of some historic work or artifact for his information&mdash;it was never for sale.
