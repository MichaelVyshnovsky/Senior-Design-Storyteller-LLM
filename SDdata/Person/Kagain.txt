{{Quote|''"Gold runs the world, kid. Faster ya learn that, the better life will treat ya'."''|Kagain}}
'''Kagain''' was a [[dwarven]] merchant and [[fighter]] that lived in the town of [[Beregost]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He owned and operated a mercenary company that specialized in protecting caravans.

==Personality==
Kagain was determined to gain as much wealth as possible. This desire reached a level of obsession in his mind. As such he was very anti-social and had a particular dislike for [[elves]].

==Abilities==
Even for a dwarf Kagain had an impressive fortitude. He was so hearty that he slowly [[regenerate]]d injuries over a period of time.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, one of the caravans under the protection of Kagain's mercenaries disappeared while en route to [[Baldur's Gate]]. He would normally not care, but it was uncommon for caravans to disappear entirely.
