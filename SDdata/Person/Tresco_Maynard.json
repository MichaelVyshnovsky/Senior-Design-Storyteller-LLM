        "mainbody": "resco Maynard, also known as the Practitioner or the Ermine, was a mage, scholar, and advisor who lived in Tethyr during the mid-to-late 15 century DR.\nHe was a rather handsome man, with graying hair and a powerful build, that belied his advanced age.\nIn his youth, Tresco had a keen mind and was prone to obsessive studying. His mind tended to wander in his later years and he had lost much of his mental acuity. He was a noted misogynist who greatly underestimated the intellect of the women in his life, and treated them as objects to merely protect.\nFor a very brief time, Tresco remained in possession of the artifact known as the Torque, a single link in the chain that imprisoned the being known as the Captive.\nTresco spent much of his time in his familial estate of Kinnard Keep. He served as the personal instructor for the young lad Daviel, After Evonne and Teague were slain in two terrible murders on the same night, Tresco took on Ysabel, Evonnes daughter, as his own ward. Unfortunately for the young girl, Tresco kept her locked away, purportedly for her own safety.\nThe old mage lived a second life away from the court of Tethyr. As the Practitioner, Tresco oversaw Vankila Slab prison, which sat atop an earthmote floating over the realm of Muranndin. There he performed horrific magical experiments on hapless prisoners, carrying on the research of his dear patron, the late Evonne Linden.\nHe had a fondness for black leaf, and enjoyed playing Scaffold Knights and Routacelle.\nHe was especially close to Evonne Linden, and considered part of his lifes work to carry on her vision for the nation of Tethyr.\nIn the years before her passing, Evonne Linden offered to Tresco her research on ancient sarrukh magic. She encouraged him to lead an expedition to Chult, in order to find a powerful artifact and unknown wealth in the lost city of Hisari.\nTragedy struck Tethyr in the , when elves of the Wealdath attacked the Winter Palace at a gathering of nobles and members of the royal family. Tresco was one of three people who survived the killing, along with Ysabel Linden and her \"rescuer\", Declan Cardew. Evonne Linden was killed that same night in the village of Celleu.\nDetermined to carry on her legacy, Tresco Maynard bided his time for the right moment to act. He continued Evonnes research by experimenting on the prisoners of Vankila Slab. \nUsing Evonnes notes, Tresco uncovered the location of an artifact known as the Torque, hidden within the lost sarrukh city of Hisari. Tresco would then depose Queen Anais from the throne, before installing Cardew and Ysabel as king and queen, regents he could manipulate from behind the scenes.\nThe conspiracy was successful in part. Where Cardew failed in his quest, a group of adventurers led by Harp Levesque succeeded. Unfortunately for them, Tresco seized the Torque from their possession, and portalled himself back to Kinnard Keep. Once home, Tresco discovered he had been artfully out-maneuvered. The girl he knew as Ysabel held the soul of his former patron, the girls own mother, Evonne Linden. Evonne had manipulated Tresco and Cardew into retrieving for her an elixer containing the blood of the Captiveâ€”a task at which they had miserably failed. Ysabel-Evonne viciously killed Tresco for his incompetence."
