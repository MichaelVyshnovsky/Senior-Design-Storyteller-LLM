        "mainbody": "Pilot Demitrick was a warrior and famed guide from Targos in Icewind Dale who traveled northwest Faer√ªn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nPilot was born to a family of fishers in the fishing village of Targos. His parents owned and operated three small boats, but their catches were good and were shipped as far away as Triboar and Leilon in the south in the 1350s DR.\nBut during the Battle of Icewind Dale, in the , Akar Kessells army surrounded and then occupied Targos. While many citizens were frightened into hiding, Pilots father, a man known as the Old Scout, and three trusted comrades carried out guerrilla strikes on Kessells forces. In retaliation, Kessell took Pilots mother hostage and her husband was forced to surrender. They were both killed as an example to the town, leaving Pilot orphaned before the occupation was ended.\nIn response to the loneliness and loss of being orphaned, Pilot felt compelled to be open and honest with everyone he encountered so that he might make good friends with them. Pilot would do anything for his friends and his friendship was a lifelong bond.\nHe found work as a caravan leader, a guide for tourists and travelers, a hunter, a sage, and an all-purpose mercenary. He guided miners, survivalists, and adventurers and the like into some of the most dangerous regions of the Savage Frontier, earning him renown as a guide across the North."
