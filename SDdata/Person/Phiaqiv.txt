Phiaqiv was one of the leading ixzan members of the Xendreth, the ruling council of Malydren, in 1370 DR as well as the citys archmage.
Phiaqiv was born in the year of Malydrens founding, 602 DR, and together with Zekaqux was transformed into a greater vampire by an avatar of Ilxendren. In time, thank to their experience, she and Zekaqux become the leading members of the Xendreth. 
Phiaqivs field of study was necromancy and she had a coterie of lesser ixzan wizard vampires as attendants and apprentices.
