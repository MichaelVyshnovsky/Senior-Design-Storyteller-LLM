'''Kez''' was a [[half-orc]] [[paladin]] in service to a merciful [[goddess]]<ref group="note">Kez's goddess is left unnamed. sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He possessed a holy [[amulet|medallion]] gifted to him by his goddess, which was said to contain a [[spell]] powerful enough to vanquish the most powerful of [[undead]] creatures.

==History==
At some point while he was still quite young, Kez ventured to the ruins of [[Omu]] within the jungles of [[Chult]] to confront [[Ras Nsi]], whom he saw as a fallen fellow paladin. Believing Nsi to have been warped into something undead and unnatural, he planned to use the power of his goddess's medallion to vanquish the villain. However, during his confrontation with Nsi, a [[flying monkey]] managed to steal his sacred medallion. This left Kez panicked, torn between his oath to slay Nsi and his doubt that he could do so without his goddess's treasure.
