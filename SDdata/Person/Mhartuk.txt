'''Mhartuk''' was a [[human]] [[sorcerer]] and the Overking of [[Lapaliiya]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|21}}

==Relationships==
His son was the proud and willful Prince Royal [[Shaliim Wyrmslayer]].

==History==
In his younger days, Mhartuk wielded mighty magics and was considered one of the best battle-mages in [[Faer√ªn]]. He was described as a [[lion]] of a man.

However, he not only survived, he got old, and senile. By [[1357 DR]], the aged monarch had gained a reputation as a gentle scholar who passed his days playing games.

Finally, in the {{yearlinkName|1371}}, he died of [[heartstop]] and Shaliim succeeded him as Overking of Lapaliiya.

==Activities==
Mhartuk enjoyed playing board games.
