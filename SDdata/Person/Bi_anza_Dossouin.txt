'''Bi'anza Dossouin''' was a [[drow]] wizard of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bi'anza hailed from the long-destroyed [[House Dossouin]] and had joined Bregan D'aerthe.

In [[1488 DR]], Bi'anza was the spellcaster of the patrol led by [[Braelin Janquay]] sent to monitor the [[demon]] army of [[Zhindia Melarn]]. However, Bi'anza reported that thanks to his [[spell]] he had identified a very large drow army approaching, composed of all major houses except [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] and their allies [[House Hunzrin]]. So Braelin decided to gather more information about this new development.
