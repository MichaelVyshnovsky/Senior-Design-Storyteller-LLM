Bianza Dossouin was a drow wizard of Bregan Daerthe in the late 15 century DR.
Bianza hailed from the long-destroyed House Dossouin and had joined Bregan Daerthe.
In 1488 DR, Bianza was the spellcaster of the patrol led by Braelin Janquay sent to monitor the demon army of Zhindia Melarn. However, Bianza reported that thanks to his spell he had identified a very large drow army approaching, composed of all major houses except House Melarn and their allies House Hunzrin. So Braelin decided to gather more information about this new development.
