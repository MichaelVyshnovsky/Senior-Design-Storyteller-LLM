'''Rulisqer of Tyr''' was a [[human]] male [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]], god of justice, who policed the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]] around [[1370 DR]].

Rulisqer and his fourteen followers believed that public safety and lawful behavior would bring happiness and prosperity to all. Through diligent, expert policing, they broke up brawls in the streets and kept out thieves' guilds. Those who drew a weapon would soon find themselves subdued, disarmed, and marched out of town. The Tyrrans seemed to always know when and where there was going to be trouble. Thanks to their efforts, Mossbridges saw very little crime.
