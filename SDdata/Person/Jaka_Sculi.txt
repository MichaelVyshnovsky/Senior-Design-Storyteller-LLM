'''Jaka Sculi''' was a rash young man in the town of [[Auckney]], nestled along the [[Cold Run]].

==Description==
Jaka was rather self-centered and felt he was better than everyone else. He "fell in love" with [[Meralda Ganderlay]] only after learning of Lord [[Feringal Auck]]'s interest in her. He spent a lot of time away from the town cursing his lot and life, particularly when it came to his "love."  

==History==
Jaka originally came from [[Luskan]] but moved to Auckney with his mother in [[1365 DR]]. He and his mother were distant descendants of the mercenary princes of the [[Blade Kingdoms]].

Around [[1369 DR]], being possessive of his love-interest Meralda, he vowed to the gods that he would take her virginity, for the sole reason that the Lord, who's eyes she had caught, wouldn't get it. He fathered one child but died before it was born. He fell off the sea cliffs during Meraldas wedding to the Lord of Auckney, [[Feringal Auck]] while shouting Meraldas name. Meralda wedded Lord Feringal in order to save her mother's life. The child was named [[Colson]] after being adopted by [[Wulfgar]] and [[Delly Curtie]].
