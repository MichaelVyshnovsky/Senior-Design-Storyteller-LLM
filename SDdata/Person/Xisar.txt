Xisar, or simply the Blue Kraken, was a powerful kraken of history in Ser√¥s.
A very unusual sapphire-blue-tinged kraken, Xisar attacked Espurr and the Hills of Eralis multiple times, trying to enslave the eastern locathah tribes.
In 1297 DR, Xisar began its last terror campaign. In 1304 DR, the storm giant hero Volar confronted the Blue Kraken at the Bymmal Trench. Neither hero nor villain were seen since.
By 1370 DR, most beings considered Xisar a creature of legend.
Usually it was awake for six years of every twenty-four.
