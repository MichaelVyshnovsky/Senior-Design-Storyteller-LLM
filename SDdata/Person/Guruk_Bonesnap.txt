'''Guruk Bonesnap''' was the leader and self-proclaimed "King" of the [[ogre]] gang that inhabited the old tollhouse in the [[Wild Hills]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|''You know what happen to them not pay toll? We put them in big pot, cook them up, and give them to kings ogres, Guruk Bonesnap?''|Ogre Bridgekeeper}}

==Description==
Like many of his kin, Guruk Bonesnap was quite ugly and had poor [[hygiene]] and stank of rotten milk and foul body odor. He had misshapen yellowed broken teeth and an arrogant disposition.

==Possessions==
While under Guruk Bonesnap's control, the tollhouse's ogres demanded 3000 [[gold]] pieces in exchange for safe passage. Alternatively, the ogre "king" offered free passage to anyone willing to slaughter his hatred [[gnoll]] adversaries. The ogre king wielded an [[enchanted]] ''+2'' [[double axe]].

==History==
At some point before 1372 DR, Guruk Bonesnap inherited the title and the "crown" from [[Kolgok Skullcrush]], after smashing the ogre chieftain's head. Under Guruk's leadership and aided by a cunning [[oni mage]], the ogre tribe pushed a gnoll community from the old toll house in the Wild Hills. Ogres wanted to become rich off the tolls collected via strength and intimidation. The gnoll chieftain - [[shaman]] [[Rattlefang]], retreated with his tribe to a ruined structure and a cavern nearby and called it their fort. The gnolls looked for the opportunity to take back the toll house while Guruk's ogres - to slaughter the gnolls. Both parties requested help from the [[Hero of Daggerford]]; however, the end result remained unclear.
