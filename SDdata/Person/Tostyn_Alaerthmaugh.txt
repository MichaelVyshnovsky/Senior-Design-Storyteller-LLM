'''Tostyn Alaerthmaugh''' was a [[mercury dragon]] living in the [[Evermoors]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Tostyn usually liked to wander around the area more than remain in his lair.

==History==
During the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], during a trip to the [[High Forest]], Tostyn was attacked by two very young [[green dragon]]s who'd succumbed to madness. He killed one and injured the other and later retreated to his lair with a severe injury.

==Personality==
Tostyn was curious, proud, and reckless. He was totally unpredictable, changing ideas at any moment. Sometimes he fought larger dragons only to abandon the fight soon after.

==Relationship==
Tostyn's unpredictability made it hard for him to have friends. ''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], his only friend was the [[sorcerer]] [[pseudodragon]] [[Laeralyn]], whom he saved from the [[black dragon]] [[Cheleen]] in the [[High Moor]]. During the Rage, unknown to him, Tostyn gained an enemy in the green dragon [[Chloracridara]], who wanted vengeance for the death of one of her offspring and the wounding of the other.

==Hoard==
Tostyn's hoard was full of strange curiosities from all around the [[Realms]], like a mummified [[beholder]], a [[green dragon]] skeleton in a [[Nimbral]]i glass armor, many kinds of strange [[golem]]s and [[automaton]]s, and many other strange things. In his wanderings, Tostyn sometimes helped adventurers, chased [[wyvern]]s, destroyed pirate ships, or simply dodged among the storm clouds.
