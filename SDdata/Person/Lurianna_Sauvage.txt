'''Lurianna Sauvage''' was a [[werewolf]] servant who lived in the kennels of [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''My Darling Dufay, despite all your promises that when we went to the afterlife we'd go together, you went without me.  Or did you? I found your body and the empty bottle - I know you took a potion, but was it poison or something else? Here are two more identical bottles - I'm going to drink one of them and then I'll join you, one way or another. I love you for eternity.''|Lurianna's letter}}

==History==
Lurianna entered [[Cazador Szarr]]'s service some time before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, where she met Chamberlain [[Antwun Dufay]], one of Cazador's [[vampire spawn]] servants. The werewolf and the vampire spawn became lovers. When, in 1492 DR, Cazador Szarr decided to perform a ritual that would elevate him to being a [[vampire ascendant]], Antwun was ordered to become part of the ritual. However, Dufay knew of what would happen to him in the ritual and made a plan to avoid that grim fate. He purchased a potion from [[Bonecloak's Apothecary]] that would knock the imbiber out, giving Dufay the appearance of death and to make sure the illusion was believable, he also purchased lookalike potions of [[acid]] [[poison]].

It was unknown if Antwun Dufay consumed the potion and outlived his master. By the time the ritual began, his body was found in the Szarr Palace, showing evidence of acid poisoning, implying he accidentally drank the wrong vial. Lurianna Sauvage, was not informed of the her lover's plan as he was unsure if she could be trusted not to betray him to Cazador. When Lurianna found her beloved's body, she wrote a goodbye note and drank another deadly potion, following Dufay into the afterlife. He body was turned to slush from the inside by the poison.
