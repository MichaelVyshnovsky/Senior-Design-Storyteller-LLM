        "History": "Esmerandanna made her lair within the Emerald Crater shortly after the eruption of the volcano in the {{YearlinkName|77}}. She lived there ever since.<ref name=tGHotR-p61>\n\nEsmerandanna was something of a sage and she took a keen interest in the traditions and history of the [[wild dwarves]], who wandered the surrounding jungles. Although at first she feared they would only desire to steal her hoard, with the customary emerald dragon paranoia, this gradually faded over the centuries and was replaced with a firm friendship with the various priests of their god, [[Thard Harr]], the Lord of the Jungle Deeps. Esmerandanna even accepted them storing their most sacred [[runestone]]s within her lair and under her protection.\n\nThus, the Emerald Crater, or Morndin Vertesplendarrorn to the wild dwarves, remained one of their most sacred sites, rather than abandoning it in a generation or so as was their habit. They returned often to worship Thard, make their carvings, and leave them in the care of their guardian dragon, whom they held in their mythology to be the daughter, or ''[[Dwarvish_dictionary#D|daul]]'', of Thard Harr.\n\nShe was known to still be alive after the [[Dracorage]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}."
