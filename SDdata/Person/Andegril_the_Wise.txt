'''Andegril the Wise''' was an [[orc]] [[shaman]] and leader of the armies of [[Hlundadim]].

==History==
In [[111 DR]] Andegril led an army of orcs and [[goblinoid]]s to invade [[Anauria]]. His campaign was a success and Anauria was destroyed, but the defenders put up such a fight that the orc host was annihilated as well, reducing the orcish population of the [[Goblin Marches]] for centuries.
