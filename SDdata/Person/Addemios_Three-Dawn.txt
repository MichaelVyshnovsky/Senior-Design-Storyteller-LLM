'''Addemios Three-Dawn''' was an [[high elf]] priest and secret devotee of [[Asmodeus]] who masqueraded as a follower [[Corellon]] at the [[Temple of Leaves]] in [[New Sharandar]].

==Personality==
As was befitting his patron deity, Addemios was a duplicitous individual, fully capable of living a double-life among those who placed their trust in him.

==Abilities==
Addemios was capable of bringing down the wrath of his god, afflicting his foes with magical energy that was both radiant and necrotic in nature. He could also shoot out bursts of ''eldritch'' energy, in a manner that was similar to [[Eldritch blast|those created]] by [[warlock]]s.

==Possessions==
He worse a suit of [[chainmail]] armor, and carried both a [[short sword]] and magical [[rod]] on his person.

==Activities==
Addemios' true goal was more nefarious than rebuilding the ancient elven empire. He wanted to start a war between the Iliyanbruen [[elves]] and the people of [[Neverwinter]], under orders of his god Asmodeus.

==Relationships==
Addemios served as the assistant to [[Emrae Firesky]], head priestess of the [[Temple of Leaves]] in New Sharandar. As such he was considered as one of the leaders of the community, working under [[Merrisara Winterwhite]] who sought to bring back glory to the [[Iliyanbruen]] [[high elf|eladrin]] of Old Sharandar.
