Peieyrie Taskaloath (pronounced PEER-ee) was the co-owner of the Swinging Sword inn in Red Larch with her sister, Jhandlatha Taskaloath.
Like her sister, Peieyrie was venerable and down to earth.
Elminster Aumar once stated that Peieyrie inherited unknown magical items from her father.
Peieyrie and her sister loved to hear tales of adventurers exploits. If threatened, she would defend herself with fireball and lightning bolt spells.
Originally from Luskan, Peieyrie and her sister lost their father who opposed the Arcane Brotherhood.
