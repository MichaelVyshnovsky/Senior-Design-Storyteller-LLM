Swordcaptain Mhaelorin was a half-elf (moon elf and Illuskan) ranger, who served Baron Erthaer Javilarhhsson in Starshadow Vale.
Erthaer once saved Mhaelorins life during a fierce battle with orcs. Mhaelorin later followed Erthaer as his Swordcaptain to the new settlement of Starshadow Vale, acting as his faithful cohort. They both perished in 702 DR when the Horned Horde burst from the High Forest and laid waste to the Vale, before proceeding on to the rest of Delimbiyran.
