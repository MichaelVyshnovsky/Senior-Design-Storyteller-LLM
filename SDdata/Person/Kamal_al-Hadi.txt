Kamal was an ancient and skeletal man. He outlived several wives, children, and even grandchildren. Kamal spoke and moved slowly, but this behavior masked the incredibly sharp mind he possessed.
Kamal was a half-elven shair of great skill. He was a master planner and was usually several steps ahead of anyone looking to gain advantage over him.
All of Kamals wives were human women, leading to all of his offspring being human as well.
