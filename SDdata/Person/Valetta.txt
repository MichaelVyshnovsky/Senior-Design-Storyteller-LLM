'''Valetta''' was a [[dragonborn]] priest of [[Gond]] at the [[House of Inspired Hands]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} Valetta was in charge of taking care of the [[nimblewright]] [[Nim]]. Following the detonation of a ''[[fireball]]'' in [[Trollskull Alley]] that killed the [[gnome]] [[Dalakhar]], Valetta discovered that a nimblewright of Nim's own creation was involved in the attack and decided to strip Nim of all his construction materials.
