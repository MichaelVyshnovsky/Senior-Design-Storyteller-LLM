        "mainbody": "'''Zalathorm Kirkson''' was the [[Netyarch]], or [[wizard]]-king, of the nation of [[Halruaa]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "As of [[1367 DR]], Zalathorm served as the leader of Halruaa and head of the [[Council of Elders (Halruaa)|Council of Elders]]. Zalathorm's tower in [[Halarahh]] served as the seat of his rulership. When meeting with the Council, he would use a magical crystal orb that allowed him to contact all 400 Elders of the Council if needed.\n\nAt some point, Zalathorm enlisted the Halruaan wizard [[Dwalimar Omen]] and the crew of the [[Halruaan skyship|skyship]] ''[[Realms Master]]'' to hunt down dangerous [[artifact]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Among Zalathorm's vast collection of [[magical item]]s was a special carriage that radiated a ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'' upon command. This wondrous carriage was a true rarity in the arcane world since a ''globe of invulnerability'' was stationary when cast. Zalathorm never parted with the secret by which he was able to accomplish the magical feat of a mobile ''globe of invulnerability''.",
        "History": "In their youth, Zalathorm and [[Akhlaur]] worked together to develop a [[spell]] that granted them both everlasting life.\n\nAklhaur was rescued in [[1373 DR]] thanks to the efforts of the [[wild elf]] [[halruaan magehound|magehound]] [[Kiva]] and the [[sorceress]] [[Tzigone]]. After being released from the portal, Aklhaur launched an attack against Halruaa, triggering the [[Wizardwar]]. During the battle, Aklhaur faced Zalathorm, and both killed each other."
