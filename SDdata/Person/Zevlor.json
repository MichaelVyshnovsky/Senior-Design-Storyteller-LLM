        "mainbody": "ommander Zevlor was a member of the Hellriders of Elturel that came to lead a group of fellow tiefling refugees across the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.\nZevlor had mid-long black hair, some of which was tied up at the back. He had two large horns and bright yellow eyes, and fought with a pair of swords.\nEven after leaving Elturel, Zevlor held onto the enchanted gauntlets he wore, a pair known as Hellriders Pride.\nBefore the Descent of Elturel the , Zevlor was a proud member of the Hellriders of Elturgard. When the city returned to the Prime from Avernus in the Nine Hells, newfound bigotry against tieflings led to them being expelled from their home. \nZevlor arose as a leader of the group and led them west along the Risen Road towards Baldurs Gate. Eventually they were given shelter at the Emerald Grove, by the grace of Archdruid Halsin.\nSome time later, the adventurer Aradin led a pack of goblins led by Zakrug towards the groves main gates. After expressing his disapproval about the groups entrance, Zevlor tried to let them in but were stopped by the assaulting goblins. As a result, the tiefling Kanon was shot dead with an arrow. Zevlor was presented with a dilemma, he had to keep the peace with some druids who did not approve of his groups presence, while simultaneously getting his kind ready for a long trek to Baldurs Gate."
