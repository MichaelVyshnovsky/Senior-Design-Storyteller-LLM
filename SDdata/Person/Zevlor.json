        "mainbody": "Commander '''Zevlor''' was a member of the [[Hellriders]] of [[Elturel]] that came to lead a group of fellow [[tiefling]] refugees across the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Zevlor had mid-long black hair, some of which was tied up at the back. He had two large horns and bright yellow eyes, and fought with a pair of [[sword]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Even after leaving Elturel, Zevlor held onto the [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[gauntlets]] he wore, a pair known as ''[[Hellrider's Pride]]''.",
        "History": "Before [[the Descent]] of Elturel the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Zevlor was a proud member of the Hellriders of [[Elturgard]]. When the city returned to the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]] from Avernus in the [[Nine Hells]], newfound bigotry against tieflings led to them being expelled from their home. \n\nZevlor arose as a leader of the group and led them west along the [[Risen Road]] towards [[Baldur's Gate]]. Eventually they were given shelter at the [[Emerald Grove]], by the grace of [[Archdruid]] [[Halsin]].\n\nSome time later, the adventurer [[Aradin]] led a pack of [[goblin]]s led by [[Za'krug]] towards the grove's main gates. After expressing his disapproval about the group's entrance, Zevlor tried to let them in but were stopped by the assaulting goblins. As a result, the tiefling [[Kanon]] was shot dead with an arrow. Zevlor was presented with a dilemma, he had to keep the peace with some druids who did not approve of his group's presence, while simultaneously getting his kind ready for a long trek to [[Baldur's Gate]]."
