Burgaun Malsim was a human hostler at the Yawning Portal inn in Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.
Circa 1375 DR, the lad worked for the stablemaster Tarlgarth Vathar alongside Rory Starkbuckle. They sought his respect above all. If trouble broke out at the inn and Durnan was unavailable or incapacitated, he would get Durnans horn and blow it to summon the Red Sashes.
