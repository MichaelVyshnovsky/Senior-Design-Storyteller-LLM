==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Filbur tried to get more [[Amaunatori]] [[priest]]s to aid the Purple Dragons in battle. The fellow organizing their efforts, [[Anazar Narroun]], instead put his attention into investigating the outbreaks at the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]], [[Uthe Lodge]], and the druid [[Halsaime]] of [[Thorngap]].
