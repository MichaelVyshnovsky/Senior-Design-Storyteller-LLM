'''Hetha''' was the student of [[Neverwinter Academy]].

==Biography==
Hetha was a wizard of [[Neverwinter Academy]], who was [[Qara]]'s enemy. When Qara burned the stables at the Academy and went off, Hetha and [[Glina]] tracked her to [[Sunken Flagon]] inn.

==Gameplay==
When the Kalach-Cha and the companions persuaded the City Watchmen to work with the thieves or stay with the Watch, they would encounter Qara trading insults with Hetha and Glina. The Kalach-Cha could've resolved the matter, causing Hetha and Glina to walk away.
