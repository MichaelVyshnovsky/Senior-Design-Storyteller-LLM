Daern claimed to have discovered a lost dwarven city beneath the [[Mosstrunks]], an area deep within the woods of the [[Elven Court]] of [[Cormanthor]]. He entreated the dwarven community of [[Tasseldale]] with tales of how well preserved the ruins were, but declined to share how he had found them in the first place. News of his discovery quickly spread as far as [[Mulmaster]], and it became rumored that he had found great wealth, powerful artifacts, or both."
