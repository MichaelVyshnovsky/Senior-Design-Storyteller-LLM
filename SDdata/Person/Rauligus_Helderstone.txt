Rauligus Helderstone was a lord of Cormyr, who later left for Sembia and died there in the late 15 century DR. He was briefly impersonated by Mirt.
Elminster Aumar reasoned that Lord Helderstone mustve loved money. Lord Traevyn Illance believed him an honest man in life.
The man owed an impressive sum to Traevyn Illance.
According to Elminster Aumar, a fugitive mage, Lord Helderstone had spent a score, or twenty, years living as a recluse in Sembia. He had also died recently as of late Mirtul in the . Per the more precise Traevyn Illance, Rauligus Helderstone had spent twenty-nine summers in Sembia. Before his parting, Lord Illance had loaned him 700,000 golden lions, with a clause that on the year-day, 10,000 more would be owed. The sum was to be repaid in full upon return to Suzail.
An impersonator, Mirt the moneylender, was caught in Suzail during late Mirtul, by armsmen under the mages Scarmar Heldeth and Morligul Downdagger, themselves working for Traevyn Illance. The latter, rather than believe it was an impersonator, believed some threat had arisen out of Sembia and frightened the man.
Despite his extensive plans on what to do to punish the man, they could not come to fruition, as Mirt was rescued and Traevyn knocked out.
