Arlagh Deathclaw was the "Old Gut", or chieftain, of the Ripped Gut orc tribe that lived in the stronghold of Baraskur, in the Nether Mountains during the 14 century DR.
While Arlagh typically led the tribe with the help of a council of elders, his authority was overshadowed in the presence of the ghost of the sorceress, Aumathra. When her spirit would periodically possess a body brought to her by the orcs, her commands superseded all others and she treated the orcs as slaves.
Chief Arlagh had a son, Ragrath Deathclaw, who was a cleric of Gruumsh who was greatly influenced by Orauth Skullstone, another faithful of the One-Eyed God.
