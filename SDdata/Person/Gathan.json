        "mainbody": "Gathan was a male lizardfolk ranger and the chieftain of the Sharptooth tribe in the Vast Swamp of Cormyr in the early 1370s DR.  \nIn early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Gathan appeared to be killed during fighting with the attacking Shadowscale tribe, but was captured alongside others.Cormyr The Tearing of the Weave page 40 says \"They captured the old chieftain\", but later says \"the death of the previous chieftain at the hands of the Shadowscales\", and he is later found alive as a prisoner. It is not clear whether he was thought dead or not. He was held prisoner in the tower of the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp, along with Ashala, Gruss, Kurash, and Sithen. The ordeal left them weary and emaciated. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to Mystra investigating Sharran activities there.\nAfterward, Gathan was displeased to learn that he was believed dead and had been replaced as chieftain by the priest Kessessek. Desiring an honorable death, Gathan tried to die fighting alongside the adventurers against his Sharran captors as they continued their quest he would even challenge them if they tried to stop him.\nGathan was a practiced ranger, specializing in the hunting of magical beasts."
