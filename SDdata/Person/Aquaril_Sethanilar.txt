Aquaril Sethanilar was the Delphine Regent of the Istishian faith.
Sethanilar was a young aquatic elf who lived in great secrecy in the Castle of the Dancing Dolphin. He was protected by numerous guardians of both typical and monstrous nature.
Some time in the midâ€“14 century, the firstborn of a descendent of the Grand Oracle Seldeetha Darinaalis ascended to the position of Delphine Regent.
