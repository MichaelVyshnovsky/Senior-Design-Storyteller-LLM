'''Chitikas''' was a [[couatl]] servant of [[Qotal]].

==History==
Chitikas was the main agent of Qotal in preparation for his god's return. He appeared to [[Erixitl]], the girl prophesied to call back Qotal, and gave her the ability to speak with [[Faerun]]ian people.

Chitikas appeared again during the [[Night of Wailing]], just after the death of [[Naltecona]], to guide Erixitl and [[Halloran]] in fighting the [[Ancient Ones]]. During the fighting against the [[drow]] at the [[Highcave]] in [[Mount Zatal]], he sacrificed himself in order to kill the Ancestor and destroy the [[Darkfyre]].
