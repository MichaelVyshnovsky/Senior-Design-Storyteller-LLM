Chitikas was a couatl servant of Qotal.
Chitikas was the main agent of Qotal in preparation for his gods return. He appeared to Erixitl, the girl prophesied to call back Qotal, and gave her the ability to speak with Faerunian people.
Chitikas appeared again during the Night of Wailing, just after the death of Naltecona, to guide Erixitl and Halloran in fighting the Ancient Ones. During the fighting against the drow at the Highcave in Mount Zatal, he sacrificed himself in order to kill the Ancestor and destroy the Darkfyre.
