        "mainbody": "Count '''Krimmon Amethystall''' was the Fleet Chancellor of [[Tethyr]] and the ruler of [[Vintor|County Vintor]] in the [[Purple Marches]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Count Amethystall was short, even for a [[halfling]].",
        "Personality": "Krimmon was a grumpy halfling man who lost his temper easily. He was greedy to a fault, but his diligence and talent for handling large sums of money made him well-suited for his job as the country's Fleet Chancellor.\n\nDespite being in charge of the navy's finances, Krimmon was phobic of water and could not swim.\n\nHe was extremely disliked by King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Haedrak's]] [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]], [[Purlakhonthiis]].",
        "Activities": "As Fleet Chancellor, Krimmon was responsible for the management of the finances of the royal navy.\n\nKrimmon was bothered by that only one halfling sat on the [[Zaranda Star|queen's]] Privy Council in 1370, while the [[Elf|elves]] had three seats, despite that five times as many halflings lived in Tethyr as did elves. He was hoping to be appointed a seat to improve his social status.\n\nKrimmon had been unable to find a wife suitable to his stringent tastes after two years of actively searching. His requirements for a wife were the following:\n* a native Tethyrian halfling woman,\n* a woman of \"poise, grace, and beauty\",\n* a woman to improve his standing at court,\n* a woman to increase his riches, and\n* a woman with foreign connections.\nIn 1370, Krimmon began to consider eliminating his first requirement to seek for a spouse outside of Tethyr.",
        "Holdings": "Krimmon's official estate as the Count of Vintor was [[Amethyst Hall]], though he disliked the high ceilings of this former home of the wicked Count [[Romar Miklaas]].",
        "History": "In 1370 DR, Krimmon Amethystall was nominated by [[Pehllus Tanislove]] of [[Amn]] to join the [[Knights of the Shield]] as a halfling representative.",
