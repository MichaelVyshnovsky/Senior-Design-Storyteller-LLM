'''Dhourn Ba'Tol''' was the third son of [[House Ba'Tol]], a [[drow]] initiate of the [[Gravenhollow]]'s Living Library, and a first-rank [[evoker]] who lived in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
He was a drow elf with long white hair.

==Relationships==
Before becoming rivals, Dhourn was a friend of [[Filro]] and [[Xargrim]].

==History==
Dhourn Ba'Tol was born in the noble House Ba'Tol and sought glory, which he couldn't achieve as he was not the primary heir of his house. He studied at Gravenhollow.

In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Dhourn, Filro and Xargrim began to search out the legendary [[Adamantine Forge]]. They divided their responsibilities in searching for clues. Dhourn was responsible for finding the location of the Forge. He locked his findings away in a memory shard, which he was carrying with him. The shard answered to the pass-phrase "Dhourn, Lord Archmage", marking his self-esteem and ambitions.

Later, however, the three didn't want to share the information they found and became rivals, aiming to get all the glory for themselves. Dhourn found a group of drow mercenaries and vowed to share his fortune with them in exchange for protection if they found the Adamantine Forge. The group consisted of [[Arcagh]], [[Artimezt]], [[Izwae]], [[Moy]], and [[Tecothy]]. 

Once, Dhourn and his rival Xargrim met. The rivals were both planning to ambush each other, but began to talk of a pact, ultimately arguing until their words turned to screams. Xargrim summoned an unusual [[spectator]] adept at [[petrification]] and fled. Dhourn and his companions were all petrified for so long that Dhourn's memory shard faded. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, their petrified bodies still stood near a [[Shattered Sanctum|Sel√ªnite outpost]].
