        "History": "Iorn lived with his brother [[Bhún Ludwakazar]] and the rest of his clan in the Earthspur Mountains, acting as custodians of the mystical [[Chamber of Falling Stones]].\n\nIn his youth, he had a bad argument with his brother about a sword they had found hidden in the mine. In the end, Bhùn was exiled. In time, Iorn had a daughter, [[Lherzona Ludwakazar]].\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], after a recent mining excavation by miners from [[Mulmaster]], a [[medusa]] and her [[gargoyle]] minions took control of the Chamber. In a battle, King Iorn was mortally wounded. Lherzona and the others remained to await the death of Iorn, keeping out intruders. Then an adventuring party hired to clear the mine arrived.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|13}} After the adventurers solved the matter, Iorn finally died and Lherzona was crowned queen of her people. Iorn also had the chance to reconcile with Bhùn thanks to the adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|21}}"
