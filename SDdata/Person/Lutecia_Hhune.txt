'''Lutecia Hhune''' was a matron of the mercantile [[Hhune]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], who lived in the city during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Lutecia had little in the way of family in her golden years. With a deceased husband and no children of her own, the only family she knew was a few siblings to whom she did not speak.

She was well-served by her personal valet [[Kaddrus]], a [[cambion]] that took the visage of a particularly attractive younger man. She believed him to be quite capable in carrying out her wants and orders.

==History==
In the early 1490s [[DR]], Lutecia sought out scholars at [[High Hall]] in order to track down family members who she would find more amenable to being heir to her family's city estate.

When the ''[[Shield of the Hidden Lord]]'' was stolen from the family crypts, in the {{yearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Lady Lutecia tasked Kaddrus and his lackeys with its retrieval.
