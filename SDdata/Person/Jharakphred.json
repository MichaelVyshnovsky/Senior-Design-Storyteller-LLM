        "mainbody": "Jharakphred was a painter in Suzail during the late 15 century.\nHe was runty.\nJharakphred was nervous, whimpering and simpering.\nThe man was perhaps the best painter-for-hire in Suzail.\nHe was a painter for hire.\nJharakphred was hired by Marlin Stormserpent to paint the likenesses of Draskos Crownsilver and Gariskar Dauntinghorn, whom the painter followed for days until their retinues beat him away. He then painted their likenesses and brought them to Marlin. After being paid, he was quickly skewered by two blueflame ghosts, Relve Langral and Treth Halonter, who threw his body into a furnace, again, on Marlins orders."
