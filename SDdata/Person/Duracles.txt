'''Duracles''' ({{Pronounce|DUH|uh|cleez|ref={{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|32}}}}) was the [[pit fiend]] of the [[Nine Hells]] that oversaw the domain of [[Mirror Maelstrom]] on the plane of [[Avernus]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|15-16}}

==Personality==
Duracles was derisive towards his lessers and arrogant about his powers in combat. He always picked a fight whenever possible in order to demonstrate his martial prowess to others.

==Abilities==
He was quite adept at uncovering how best to provoke his victims and draw out their most deep-seated insecurities and fears.

==Relationships==
To carry out his duties, Duracles worked alongside the mortal [[Lysander Sallowbone]], a [[Red Wizard]] [[zulkir]] from the world of [[Toril]]. As a gesture of good faith, he gifted the [[wizard]] an ''[[oathbow]]'' crafted from hardened lava.

He was accompanied at all times by two [[kyton]] minions.

==History==
Some time during or after the 1480s [[DR]], Duracles was directed by [[Asmodeus]] to watch over the imprisonment and torture of the [[soul]] of King [[Hekaton]] of [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|23-24}}
