Duracles () was the pit fiend of the Nine Hells that oversaw the domain of Mirror Maelstrom on the plane of Avernus.
Duracles was derisive towards his lessers and arrogant about his powers in combat. He always picked a fight whenever possible in order to demonstrate his martial prowess to others.
He was quite adept at uncovering how best to provoke his victims and draw out their most deep-seated insecurities and fears.
To carry out his duties, Duracles worked alongside the mortal Lysander Sallowbone, a Red Wizard zulkir from the world of Toril. As a gesture of good faith, he gifted the wizard an oathbow crafted from hardened lava.
He was accompanied at all times by two kyton minions.
Some time during or after the 1480s DR, Duracles was directed by Asmodeus to watch over the imprisonment and torture of the soul of King Hekaton of Faer√ªn.
