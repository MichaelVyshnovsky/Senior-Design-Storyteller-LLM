        "Relationships": "Imphras was the only heir of Queen [[Ilmara]], and he was crowned as king at birth in [[1169 DR]]. His father, [[Rilaun]] of [[Sarshel]], was angered by this and tried to seize the throne instead, but he was defeated. Ilmara then ruled as regent until Imphras' sixteenth birthday in [[1185 DR]].\n\nImphras married one [[Lasheela]] of [[Dilpur]], and she bore him two sons, [[Talryn]] and [[Lashilmbrar]]. She died in [[1204 DR]], and Imphras immediately married his mistress [[Rebaera Osterhown]]. They had four more sons, [[Kuskar]], [[Velimbrar]], [[Elphras]], and [[Fylraun]].",
        "History": "In [[1196 DR]], Imphras founded the [[Knights of Imphras II|Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike]] after claiming to have seen a little [[wikipedia:en:Shrike|shrike]] attack and kill a small [[demon]] while on a hunt. This order of knights followed the traditions of the older [[Order of the Triad]] and served the throne of Impiltur.\n\nDuring the later part of his reign, shortly after he had taken Rebaera as his second wife, Imphras suffered from mental illness. (The first signs of it occurred in [[1204 DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|70}}) His oldest son, Talryn, tried to take power, claiming his father was unfit for rule, but he was exiled for this. Imphras' second son, Lashilmbrar, effectively controlled Impiltur during this time, until his father died in [[1225 DR]].\n\nKing Imphras II died in the year [[1225 DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}"
