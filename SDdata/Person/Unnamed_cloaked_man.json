        "mainbody": "A '''cloaked man''', who signed his messages as '''\"a friend\"''', was an unnamed agent active in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter}}\n{{quote|Move along now. You're drawing attention.}}",
        "History": "Following the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the cloaked man worked for an unidentified power in Neverwinter who desired for people to resettle the devastated [[Blacklake District]]. To this end, he worked to disrupt and eliminate the gangs that plagued it, the [[Nashers]] and the [[Dead Rats]], by turning them against each other. He hired a [[rogue]] adventurer to raid a Dead Ratsâ€“held house, kill the [[wererat]]s, and Nashers propaganda pamphlets by a bedroll to make it appear that a double agent was behind it.\n\nLater, in [[Neverdeath]] graveyard, he asked a rogue to recover a [[Lucanis]] family heirloom from [[Gorim Tomb-Raider]].\n\nFinally, the cloaked man learned of a plot to assassinate Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], by a group better equipped than the Nashers. Resolving to deal with it quietly to avoid embarrassing the city's ruler, the cloaked man located their hideout in [[Protector's Enclave]] and hired an adventurer to enter through a window and defeat the conspirators."
