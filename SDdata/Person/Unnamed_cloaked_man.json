To this end, he worked to disrupt and eliminate the gangs that plagued it, the Nashers and the Dead Rats, by turning them against each other. He hired a rogue adventurer to raid a Dead Ratsâ€“held house, kill the wererats, and Nashers propaganda pamphlets by a bedroll to make it appear that a double agent was behind it.\nLater, in Neverdeath graveyard, he asked a rogue to recover a Lucanis family heirloom from Gorim Tomb-Raider.\nFinally, the cloaked man learned of a plot to assassinate Lord Dagult Neverember, by a group better equipped than the Nashers. Resolving to deal with it quietly to avoid embarrassing the citys ruler, the cloaked man located their hideout in Protectors Enclave and hired an adventurer to enter through a window and defeat the conspirators."
