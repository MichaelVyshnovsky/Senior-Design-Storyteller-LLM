Shalmaneser, also called the Senile, was a lich and Arch-Vizier of the necromancer rulers of Ysawis in 1367 DR.
Shalmaneser stood a hair over  tall. The lich always wore a rotting turban inset with an enormous emerald. His eyes gleamed with the dark light of undeath.
Shalmaneser was extremely forgetful, a trait gained from centuries of magical sleep. As such he relied heavily upon his scrolls for all of his information. Without them he would be utterly helpless.
Shalmaneser served as vizier in Ysawis centuries before the citys demise. His dabbing in necromancy led him to believe he discovered the secret transformation into lichdom, but the ritual only partially succeeded. Instead Shalmanseser drank a potion of immortality that plunged him into a deep sleep for centuries. He awoke only when stirred by the call of Kazerabet and Sumulael in the 14 century DR. The centuries of sleep degraded Shalmaneser, once a powerful archmage, into a weak forgetful shadow of his former self.
Shalmaneser recalled mention of a powerful weapon called Lifedrinker, capable of destroying his new masters, and spent much of his time questioning the undead inhabitants of Ysawis to determine the weapons location.
Shalmaneser wore a robe of many pockets, slippers of soft movement, a stone of good luck, and carried many quills and nonmagical scrolls.
The lich was bound to serve Kazerabet and Sumulael, whom he hated passionately.
