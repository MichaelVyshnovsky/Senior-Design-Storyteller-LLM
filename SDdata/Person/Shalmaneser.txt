'''Shalmaneser''', also called the '''Senile''', was a [[lich]] and Arch-Vizier of the [[necromancer]] rulers of [[Ysawis]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Shalmaneser stood a hair over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. The lich always wore a rotting [[turban]] inset with an enormous [[emerald]]. His eyes gleamed with the dark light of undeath.

==Personality==
Shalmaneser was extremely forgetful, a trait gained from centuries of magical sleep. As such he relied heavily upon his scrolls for all of his information. Without them he would be utterly helpless.

==History==
Shalmaneser served as vizier in Ysawis centuries before the city's demise. His dabbing in [[necromancy]] led him to believe he discovered the secret transformation into lichdom, but the ritual only partially succeeded. Instead Shalmanseser drank a ''[[potion of immortality]]'' that plunged him into a deep sleep for centuries. He awoke only when stirred by the call of [[Kazerabet]] and [[Sumulael]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The centuries of sleep degraded Shalmaneser, once a powerful archmage, into a weak forgetful shadow of his former self.

==Activities==
Shalmaneser recalled mention of a powerful weapon called ''[[Lifedrinker]]'', capable of destroying his new masters, and spent much of his time questioning the [[undead]] inhabitants of Ysawis to determine the weapon's location.

==Possessions==
Shalmaneser wore a ''[[girdle of many pouches|robe of many pockets]]'', ''[[boots of elvenkind|slippers of soft movement]]'', a ''[[stone of good luck]]'', and carried many quills and nonmagical scrolls.

==Relationships==
The lich was bound to serve Kazerabet and Sumulael, whom he hated passionately.
