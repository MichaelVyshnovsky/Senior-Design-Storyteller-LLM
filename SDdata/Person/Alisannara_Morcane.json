In death, she looked much the same although she manifested as a hazy and insubstantial version of her living self.\nCategoryClerics\nCategoryGhosts\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryHigh priests and priestesses\nCategoryWorshipers of Lolth\nCategoryMembers of House Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of the Fane of Lolth\nCategoryInhabitants of Szith Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\ndl3u4svhtuq1u9aqqj63wpm985tu4x5"
