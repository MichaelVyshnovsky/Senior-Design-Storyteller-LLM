Yarash was a wizard and alchemist who busied himself with creating new species in his pyramid near Phlan in order to dominate the Moonsea. He created many mutants that lived in rooms of the pyramid.
Yarash was busy for 30 years in trying to create a race of freshwater sahuagin, despite never seeing a true sahuagin in his life. At last, in 1340 DR, an adventuring party killed him.
