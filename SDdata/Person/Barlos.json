        "mainbody": "Barlos was one of ten guards stationed at the enclave run by the young Red Wizard Hinnar.\nBarlos was tough, strong, and dexterous.\nLike the other guards at the enclave, Barlos was trained in the expert use of the bastard sword and possessed a finely crafted example. Barlos also carried a longspear and a composite longbow and was trained in ranged combat at short range.\nBarlos worked in alternating shifts guarding the six watch platforms, observing the sales booth, or patroling the compound grounds.\nWhen adventures came to the enclave, seeking information about the kidnapping of Talf and Elonn, Barlos was completely ignorant of the fact that the two young men had been taken by the wizard Kizzaf."
