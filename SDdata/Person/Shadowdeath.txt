'''Shadowdeath''' was a young [[shadow dragon]] who got trapped inside the [[Tower of Ruin]] while looting it in [[1353 DR]].

==Personality==
Shadowdeath was a cunning and intellectual dragon, but had no qualms about using violence to get what he wanted.

==Possessions==
He managed to gather up a respectable hoard, including thousands of [[gold piece]]s worth of coins and [[gems]]. The heap of magical items was made up of a ''+5 [[holy avenger]]'', a ''+1 [[flame tongue]] [[shortsword]]'', a ''[[mace of disruption]]'', a ''+2 [[shield]]'', a suit of ''+1 [[Blending (quality)|blending]] [[splint mail]]'', a suit of ''+2 [[chain mail]]'', a suit of ''+1 [[leather armor]]'', a ''[[staff of thunder and lightning]]'', a ''[[wand of wonder]]'', a ''[[Bucknard's everfull purse]]'', a ''large [[bag of holding]]'', and a ''[[talisman of Zagy]]''. He also gathered up potions of ''[[potion of healing|healing]]'', ''[[potion of extra-healing|extra-healing]]'', ''[[potion of speed|speed]]'', ''[[potion of longevity|longevity]]'', ''[[potion of fire resistance|fire resistance]]'', and ''[[potion of plant control|plant control]]''.

==History==
Some time after [[1352 DR]], he invaded the [[Tower of Ruin]] but was cursed by [[Torm]], trapped alongside the defenders and their assailants inside a time-locked version of the tower even as it crumbled into nothing.

Shadowdeath remained unaware of the passage of time, and finally encountered a group of adventurers in [[1369 DR]] who had sought out the mystery of the ruined tower. He probed them for information on the outside world and how to break the curse, then attacked, only to be killed and have his treasure hoard looted.
