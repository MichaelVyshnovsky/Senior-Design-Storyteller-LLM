She met interrogations with fatalism.\nBy Uktar 9 of , Cylla could not yet cast wall of force. On Ches 2 of , she cast an illusion to fool Taegan Nightwind into an ambush, for which she acquired the aid of several abishai, presumably with magic. In the same fight, she employed some legerdemain to steal the avariels strength from a device, and then a different spell to escape, presumably dimension door.

Before the Cult, she was just a teacher of minor magic employed to safeguard ships at sea.\nAfter Gorstag Helder stole Sammasters notes and took them to Taegan Nightwind, she attempted to buy them off of him, and then bully them off of him, on Ches 2 of 1373 DR.\nShe was captured by Taegan Nightwinds party while in some catacombs beneath Lyrabar on Ches 14. After some interrogation, she relayed upon them what she had experienced with Sammaster on Uktar 9 of the previous year, in the Gray Forest. As the maestro vowed to reveal her involvement in the Cult, she was forced to flee Impiltur, never to be seen again."
