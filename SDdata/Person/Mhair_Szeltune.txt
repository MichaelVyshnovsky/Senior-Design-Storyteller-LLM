Mhair Szeltune was the leader of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Mhair was a serene yet persistent and efficient lady with an iron will. She was an uncanny judge of character and was never mistaken about someone involved in the guild politics of Waterdeep.
Mhair often wandered the city while magically disguised as an old crone, in order to check the attitudes of people toward her.
