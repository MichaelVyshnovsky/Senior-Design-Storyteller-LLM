        "mainbody": "'''Hrolf the Unruly''' was a [[human]] captain of the [[Ruathym|Ruathen]] pirate ship ''[[Elfmaid (ship)|Elfmaid]]''.",
        "Description": "The captain was a large, broad-shouldered man with skin tanned by the sun and wind. His extremely light-colored braided hair was streaked through with light gray. He had blue eyes, a large mustache, and a beard.\n\nHe apparently had a terrible singing voice.",
        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], he was imprisoned in [[Skullport]] but he escaped from jail with the help of [[Liriel Baenre]]. \n\nHrolf was killed as part of a conspiracy against [[Ruathym]] in [[1361 DR]]. His funeral consisted of a large ceremony featuring a funeral bonfire intended to send him and the ''Elfmaid'' into the halls of [[Tempus]]. In honor of him, Liriel changed the figurehead of the ''Elfmaid'' into a figure of Hrolf.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Moira": "[[Moira]] was Hrolf's wife. She was short and stout with gray eyes and red cheeks and lived alone on [[Tetris]], a small island in the [[Moonshaes]]. She and Hrolf only ever saw each other during his brief stops there, but that suited them both just fine.",
            "Xzorsh": "When the [[sea elf]] [[Xzorsh]] was a child, Hrolf saved his life. He pledged to always protect the ''Elfmaid'' and her crew, usually by following it. Hrolf's relationship with Xzorsh was revelatory of Hrolf's particular care for [[elves]]."
