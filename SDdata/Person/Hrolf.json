        "mainbody": "rolf the Unruly was a human captain of the Ruathen pirate ship Elfmaid. \nThe captain was a large, broad-shouldered man with skin tanned by the sun and wind. His extremely light-colored braided hair was streaked through with light gray. He had blue eyes, a large mustache, and a beard.\nHe apparently had a terrible singing voice.\nIn 1361 DR, he was imprisoned in Skullport but he escaped from jail with the help of Liriel Baenre. \nHrolf was killed as part of a conspiracy against Ruathym in 1361 DR. His funeral consisted of a large ceremony featuring a funeral bonfire intended to send him and the Elfmaid into the halls of Tempus. In honor of him, Liriel changed the figurehead of the Elfmaid into a figure of Hrolf.\nMoira was Hrolfs wife. She was short and stout with gray eyes and red cheeks and lived alone on Tetris, a small island in the Moonshaes. She and Hrolf only ever saw each other during his brief stops there, but that suited them both just fine.\nWhen the sea elf Xzorsh was a child, Hrolf saved his life. He pledged to always protect the Elfmaid and her crew, usually by following it. Hrolfs relationship with Xzorsh was revelatory of Hrolfs particular care for elves.\nNot long after Liriel Baenre freed Hrolf from prison in Skullport and joined his crew in 1361 DR, the two began developing a close relationship. In Ruathym, Liriel stayed with Hrolf at his house and viewed him as a father, as he viewed her as a daughter. She greatly mourned his death.\n*Tangled Webs\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryPirates\nCategoryInhabitants of Ruathym\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryWorshipers of Tempus\nCategoryCaptains\nCategoryNorthlanders\nel6ixbvqjfh4ln2c20tyndaihwf45zs"
