'''Ansimmer Belold''', who was known locally as '''Father Allfaiths''', was a religious fellow inhabiting [[Suldolphor]] in the far eastern reaches of [[Calimshan]] in [[south Faer√ªn]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Despite his nickname, Ansimmer was a devout follower of [[Ilmater]], the Broken God. He oversaw a small chapel located in [[Corondor's Tower]]. Beloved by all, he spent the majority of his time tending to the Golden City's sick and wounded regardless of their race. Ansimmer also collected donations placed among the many small shrines to other gods located along Suldolphor's outer wall, distributing the funds to citizens of other faiths as he saw fit.
