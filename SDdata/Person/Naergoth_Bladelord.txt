'''Naergoth Bladelord''' was one of the [[Wearers of Purple]] in the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He was the warrior lord of the cult and the leader of the ruling council. He usually resided in [[Saerloon]].

He was one of the leaders that ordered the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]] in [[1357 DR]].

By [[1479 DR]], Naergoth had become a [[death knight]] and the co-ruler of the [[Well of Dragons]].

During the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], he was the sole commander of the Well of the Dragon and the oldest living member of the Cult. Although he did not like the new direction of the Cult under [[Severin Silrajin]], he served loyally.
