        "mainbody": "'''Coran''' was a wandering [[adventurer]] and womanizing archer of dubious virtue who traveled around [[Tethyr]] and across the Realms throughout the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He enjoyed a second, decades-long life as a politician and wealthy man-about-town in the great metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\n{{Quote|I wasn't born a rich idler; I started out as a poor adventurer, like you.|Coran, the politician.}}",
        "Description": "While most [[elves]] were slender or athletic, Coran's exuberance for luxury and excess lent his appearance a certain \"pudginess\". This was exceptionally apparent in his later years of life. \n\nHe wore garish outfits that always drew even more attention to the spectacle that was himself. He decorated himself with rather stylist [[jewelry]].",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|Go manipulate some other wide-eyed thief with a taste for gold tinged with your own special brand of regret.|Krydle, to his father Coran.}}\n\nThroughout his life, Coran had a number of romantic entanglements and flirted shamelessly with any woman he met.\n\nAs Coran settled down with age, he settled into the role of a wise, world-weary advisor.",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|Before I was a politician, I was a warrior...before that, I was a thief.|Coran, before stabbing [[Burgust]] through the chest.}}\n\nWhile his younger years were full of adventures and daring escapades, Coran's later years were spent enjoying a certain level of celebrity. He was always invited to lavish parties thrown by the [[Baldurian]] [[patriar]].\n\nHe enjoyed \"guiding\" adventurers in a manner that garnered him more wealth and offered him some form of entertainment. He had the audacity to profit off the crime that plagued Baldur's Gate, making bets on the manner that illegal activities played out.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Minsc, Coran.png|thumb|right|400px|''Coran had friends from all walks of life, including hamsters and their berserker-steeds.'']]\nSome time after the end of the [[Iron Crisis]] he began a rather tumultuous relationship with the sultry [[thief]] [[Safana]]. Some time during or after this time, be became acquainted with the famed [[Rashemaar]] adventurer [[Minsc]].\n\nCoran unknowingly fathered a [[half-elf]] child [[Namara (half-elf)|Namara]] with a young [[sorceress]] named [[Brielbara]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] after a brief fling. He also had a son named [[Krydle]], who wound up becoming a great adventurer in his own right.\n\nAs a politician, Coran had a good working relationship with Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]]. While not necessarily close, they worked together for the betterment of Baldur's Gate and were not beyond calling in favors from each other.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|19}}",
        "History": {
            "Adventuring Life": "{{Quote|Luck is always on the side of the romantic.|Coran.}}\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}} Coran was hired by [[Kelddath Ormlyr]] of [[Beregost]] to hunt a \"great winged [[dragon]]\" in the [[Cloakwood]] forest. After given the description of the beast having a barbed tail, Coran knew he was actually hunting [[wyvern]]s but accepted the bounty regardless.\n\nAfter spending some time in Baldur's Gate again, he ventured south to [[Tethyr]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He relocated back to his cabin in the [[Forest of Tethir]] and reconnected with his love Safana. Having eloped at her request, Safana attempted to use her and Coran's acquaintance with [[Abdel Adrian]] to draw the [[Bhaalspawn]] to a trap involving [[Lanfear]] and her pack of [[wolfwere]]s.",
            "Political Career": "Over the years Coran came to become a permanent resident of Baldur's Gate. He garnered a number of favors from among the Baldurain patriars. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Coran became an upstanding citizen of the city, having joined the [[Parliament of Peers]]. \n\nAt some point during the 1480s [[DR]], Corn briefly reunited with mysteriously resurrected Minsc at a revel thrown by some Baldurian nobles. At the same party, Coran was confronted by his son Krydle, who presented him with blackmail information from some unknown individual, by means of the [[Fetcher]] of the [[Undercellar]]. The reunion was not a joyous one for father or son.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5}}\n\n[[File:Coran Burgust.png|thumb|right|400px|''Coran, getting revenge for the death of his son's mother.'']]\nCoran's past caught up with him again when the [[Blades of Burgust]] stormed into a meeting of parliament at [[High Hall]]. The gang's leader [[Burgust]]―who had slain Coran's former lover―led the attack in order to assassinate the former adventurer, in an act of cold vengeance against his son Krydle. Coran's life was spared when Krydle and his partner [[Shandie Freefoot|Shandie]] joined the melee. During the fight, Coran got the upper hand on Burgust and stabbed him through the chest, in honor of Krydle's mother. Coran and Krydle shared moment together, and left on much better terms than their last meeting.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|12-17}}",
            "Last Adventure": "{{Quote|We both made so many mistakes...but there's no time left, so grab your poison blade, and we'll figure it out on the other side.|Krydle, to Coran.}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Coran was openly attacked again in High Hall, that time by [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]] of [[the Absolute]]. Fortunately for Coran, his son Krydle and his friend [[Delina]] were approaching him for aide against the cult at precisely the same time. The trio managed to to defend themselves against the cultists for a time, until they were subdued by the [[illithid]] cultist [[Uddron Blass]].{{Cite comic/Mindbreaker 2|14-19}}\n\nThe three heroes were imprisoned [[Flaming Fist]] dungeons beneath High Hall, and both Coran and Krydle infected with [[mind flayer]] tadpoles, initiating the process of [[ceremorphosis]].{{Cite comic/Mindbreaker 5|1-5}} Uddron ''[[portal]]led'' Delina away, leaving Coran and Krydle to his pet [[displacer beast]]. Krydle deftly slipped out of his bonds, killed the beast, in defense of his father, and managed to break them both out of the dungeon.{{Cite comic/Mindbreaker 5|11-17}}\n\n[[File:Coran final.png|thumb|right|350px|''Coran's final moments with his son in Baldur's Gate''.]]\n{{Quote|Well now...that sounds...splendid.|Coran's last words.}}\n\nKrydle's efforts were largely in vain. Coran was overcome by the effects of ceremorphosis, and he rapidly began the process of transformation into a mind flayer. Coran and Krydle shared one last moment together, before they both plunged his [[poison]]ed dagger into body, ending his life while preventing transformation."
