Unfortunately, the druid Halsaime became corrupted by the powers of his strange staff and became a destructive and malevolent force of nature. Garick was one of the druids that joined his cause, either of his own accord or the powerful will that Halsaime exerted, and guarded Thorn Hollow with his companion dire bears until they were overcome by Harper agents sent from Eveningstar by Kirinel Zay."
