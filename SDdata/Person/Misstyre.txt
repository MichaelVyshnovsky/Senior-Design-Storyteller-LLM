Misstyre was a drow wizard and merchant who lead a tribe of a hundred or so of his brethren in the western region of the High Forest.
The drows group would capture female elves from the nearby area under Misstyres leadership. To maintain a strong military presence, Misstyre would order his men to regularly waylay nearby travelers and woodsmen.
