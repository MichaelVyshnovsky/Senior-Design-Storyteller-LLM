His dirty blond hair contrasted sharply with those of his zakharan neighbors. His eyes were deep blue, appearing violet at times.\nFascinated by genies, Nicolai traveled far across Faer√ªn to Zakhara in order to learn the mystical ways of the shair.\nNikolai was the lead apprentice of Akim al-Kalaas."
