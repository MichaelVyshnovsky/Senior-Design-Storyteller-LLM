        "mainbody": "Nikolai Nikopolis was a member of the Unclean in 1367 DR.\nNikolai was a repugnant pig. As a favored student, he felt he could get away with anything, including pestering the low-ranking holy slayers, guards, and farisan who lived in Sarahin.\nNikolai was a tall man with pale skin. His dirty blond hair contrasted sharply with those of his zakharan neighbors. His eyes were deep blue, appearing violet at times.\nFascinated by genies, Nicolai traveled far across Faer√ªn to Zakhara in order to learn the mystical ways of the shair.\nNikolai was the lead apprentice of Akim al-Kalaas."
