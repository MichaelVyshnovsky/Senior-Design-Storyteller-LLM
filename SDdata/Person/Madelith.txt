'''Madelith''' was a [[succubus]] from the [[Nine Hells]] who was searching for the [[Infernal Stone]] in [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1490 DR]], Madelith was pursued by the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]] after they were made aware of the fiend by [[Bryn Lightfingers]]. Bryn used to belong to a band of [[ranger]]s in [[Ardeep Forest]] that had guarded the Infernal Stone, until the ranger's leader, [[Corissa Windroot]], was seduced and killed by Madelith. However, Corissa had taken the advice of Bryn and hidden away the stone before her death.

In Luskan, Madelith seduced [[Thesian]] and ordered him to procure the Infernal Stone for her. It was recovered by a band of mercenaries led by [[Kevros]] and delivered to Thesian and Madelith shortly before they were confronted by the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]].
