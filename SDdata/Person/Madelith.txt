Madelith was a succubus from the Nine Hells who was searching for the Infernal Stone in Luskan in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1490 DR, Madelith was pursued by the Order of the Burning Dawn after they were made aware of the fiend by Bryn Lightfingers. Bryn used to belong to a band of rangers in Ardeep Forest that had guarded the Infernal Stone, until the rangers leader, Corissa Windroot, was seduced and killed by Madelith. However, Corissa had taken the advice of Bryn and hidden away the stone before her death.
In Luskan, Madelith seduced Thesian and ordered him to procure the Infernal Stone for her. It was recovered by a band of mercenaries led by Kevros and delivered to Thesian and Madelith shortly before they were confronted by the Champion of the Burning Dawn.
