        "mainbody": "lonther was a wizard and a high-ranking member of the The Riders of the Sword mercenary company based at The Hold of the Sword in Turmish early in that nations history.\nHe was known to have had his quarters and workplace in a series of secret rooms somewhere within either the castle or the tunnels in the rock outcrop below it. He also built dozens of battle horrors to defend the castle.\nBy the late 14 century DR, it was thought possible that some of Olonthers battle horrors remained hidden within the castle or the tunnels, waiting to be reactivated. Furthermore, it was speculated that Olonthers spellbooks, magic items, and treasure might be with them too, and even the old mage himself in some state."
