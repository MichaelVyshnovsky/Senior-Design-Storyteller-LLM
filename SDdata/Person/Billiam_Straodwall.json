Billiam was slaughtered in gruesome fashion, his throat slit and a strange marking was made on his chest in blood. The murderer was a secret [[cult of Zariel|cultist of Zariel]] who hid amongst the refugees, [[Vollis Foote]]. Billiam's journal included a heroic description of their journey, but ultimately stopped on the night of his death.{{Cite adventurers league/Escape from Elturgard|21-23}}"
