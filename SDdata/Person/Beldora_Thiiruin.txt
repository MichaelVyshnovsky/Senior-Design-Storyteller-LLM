'''Beldora Thiiruin''' was the quiet and well-liked owner of the [[Maid of the Moors]] restaurant in [[Mornbryn's Shield]] ''circa'' [[1356 DR]]. She was known to invest heavily in any venture that was endeavored upon by her neighbors.

==Personality==
Beldora was a quiet woman and cared about her hamlet's community making her a loved part of Mornbryn's Shield.

==Possessions==
Beldora kept pet [[bat]]s and, allegedly, used them as a means of pest control. She allowed her flying critters to move about her restaurant freely.

She wore her magic ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and was armed with a [[mace]] and a [[morning star]]. She wielded her weapons in defense against [[troll]]s that were a common threat for the hamlet. In case of the dire need of her divine magic, she had spell-casting supplies tucked away: twelve blocks of ''[[incense of meditation]]'' and four ''[[Candle of invocation|candles of invocation]]''.
