'''Hama Pashar''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and [[adventurer]].

{{Quote|Someone took the time to carve these inscriptions. The least we can do is care enough to read them.|Hama Pashar}}

==Personality==
She had a keen interest in both ancient and modern cultures, though she preferred a hand-on approach to her studies rather than poring through [[book]]s. Hama was especially fond of exploring ruins and methodically uncovering their secrets, and was far more interested in acquiring knowledge than treasure.

==Activities==
Hama was part of an adventuring troupe with the [[bard]] [[Ellywick Tumblestrum]], the [[paladin]] [[Nadaar]], and the [[ranger]] [[Varis]].{{Cite MTG|AFR|213|You Find a Cursed Idol|[[Sidharth Chaturvedi]]}}
