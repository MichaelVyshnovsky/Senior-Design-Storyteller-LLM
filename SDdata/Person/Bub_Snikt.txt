Bub Snikt was a lone hunter from Beregost on the Sword Coast, active in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Bub was armored with a chain shirt and armed with a longbow and a simple short sword.
In the , Bub Snikt could be found hunting to the south of Beregost. He considered himself to be better than anyone else at what he did and what he did was not pretty. He insisted on hunting alone as others only slowed him down. Bub had a well-developed sense of smell that he used to avoid hungry ogres in the area.
