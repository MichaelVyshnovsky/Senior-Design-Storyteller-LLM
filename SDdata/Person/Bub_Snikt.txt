'''Bub Snikt''' was a lone hunter from [[Beregost]] on the [[Sword Coast]], active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Bub was armored with a [[chain shirt]] and armed with a [[longbow]] and a simple [[short sword]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Bub Snikt could be found hunting to the south of Beregost. He considered himself to be better than anyone else at what he did and what he did was not pretty. He insisted on hunting alone as others only slowed him down. Bub had a well-developed sense of smell that he used to avoid hungry [[ogre]]s in the area.
