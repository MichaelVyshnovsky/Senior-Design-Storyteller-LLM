He claimed that he had come to hunt. His arrival was on the eve of Cormyr's [[Battle with the Witch Lords]] and during the battle, Othorion's elves arrived to aid [[Galaghard III]]'s humans, swinging the battle in their favour and bringing them a victory. Othorion stated that he had felt like hunting [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s. Othorion gave his approval of the kingdom of Cormyr after the battle."
