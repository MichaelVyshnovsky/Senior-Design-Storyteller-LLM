'''Garth''', also called the '''Gimble''' or the '''Snake of Selgaunt''', was a thief in [[Cormyr]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Garth operated in [[Selgaunt]], [[Suzail]], and [[Marsember]], drifting from one to the other to dodge angry victims, pursuers, and creditors. Garth had an efficient intelligence network in those cities and often wealthy citizens asked for information from him for the right price.

He had many contacts in the area, especially among criminals dealing with warehouse fires and the resale of slightly fire-damaged goods. He could be contacted at [[The Black Stag]] in Selgaunt, the [[Roaring Griffon]] in Marsember, and any tavern in Suzail's docks.
