Teyileri Siwifi was a wealthy young woman in Port Nyanzaru, Chult, during the late 15 century DR.
She had a bold sense of style and sought to impress those to whom she spoke, if not stun them into silence.
Her father was a close associate of the merchant prince Wakanga Otamu, and she was known to spend time at the princes villa to enjoy his menagerie.
During the events of the death curse, Teyileri was embarrassed while giving a toast when a man rudely interrupted her. Seeking to make sure it did not happen again, her best solution was to acquire three magnificent necklaces&mdashfashioned from rubellite, silverspruce, and sphene&mdashbelieving that wearing such items would clearly convey her importance. She therefore contacted the Master of the Market to commission the pieces.
