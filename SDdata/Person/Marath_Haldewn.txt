'''Marath Haldewn''' was the leader of a circle of [[Chauntean]] [[druid]]s active on the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the middle of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}}

==History==
Marath was the last worshiper of [[Chauntea]] to watch over ''[[Earthmother's Weapons]]'', a book containing several spells unique to her faith. She protected the book while her order passed knowledge of its spells by oral tradition.

During the {{YearlinkName|1278}}, Marath was attacked and brutally murdered by a force of [[Malarite]] [[berserker]]s who found her hidden tree-home. While she managed to dispatch half of her assailants, she was ultimately overpowered and offered as a sacrifice to the Beastlord.
