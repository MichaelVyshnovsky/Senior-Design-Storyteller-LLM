'''Baern Harbrow''' was a [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] in [[Suzail]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was rather smug and unpleasant.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|152-154|16}}

==Possessions==
He carried a ''[[wand of sleep]]'' and likely some [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s.

==History==
In the aftermath of the calamitous [[Council of the Dragon]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Baern Harbrow, alongside no less than eight [[Purple Dragons]] and four more [[Wizards of War]], was guarding the [[Hall of Victories]].

Just as [[Glathra Barcantle]] was about to order the capture of the [[mask dancer]] and [[coinlass]], [[Amarune Whitewave]], and the Marchioness [[Immerdusk]], [[Storm Silverhand]], Baern Harbrow magically farspoke to Glathra and reported to [[Glathra]] that Lord [[Arclath Delcastle]], one of the guests at Council, had cut through his defenses with the aid of the [[ghost]] of the princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. She ordered him to continue defending his post, and after a brief struggle with Storm Silverhand, ordered him to capture the two of them, as they were headed his way. She also warned him that Storm Silverhand could reflect spells.

Once Amarune and Storm arrived, Baern Harbrow put her to sleep with his wand; the war wizards with them then converged on Storm Silverhand, but she reflected their sleep magic with a special ring that allowed her to reflect all five spells on Harbrow himself, putting him out of commission. She later stole his wands and rings.
