Yargildas of Altumbel was an adventurer of the mid-14 century DR.
Prior to his death on , Yargildas had reported on the interconnected underground chambers beneath the Barrowlands, the magical, impenetrable darkness within, and though he found no sign of fiends or undead, he had found rune circles that he suspected were portals.
Yargildas had been known to have Adriyanas Garter as of  in Impiltur, where he used it to walk up to a wizard and cut them down in spite of their spells. Other adventurers later found his possessions soaked with blood in pedestals on a tor in the desolate wilderlands north of Impiltur, with each pedestal bearing a chalked symbol a circular spot devoid of blood in one empty pedestal suggested that Adriyanas Garter had been placed there.
