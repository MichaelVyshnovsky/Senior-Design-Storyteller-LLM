'''Yargildas''' of [[Altumbel]] was an adventurer of the mid-14{{th}} century DR.

==History==
Prior to his death on {{yearlink|1356}}, Yargildas had reported on the interconnected underground chambers beneath the [[Barrowlands]], the magical, impenetrable darkness within, and though he found no sign of [[fiends]] or [[undead]], he had found rune circles that he suspected were portals.

Yargildas had been known to have ''[[Adriyana's Garter]]'' as of {{yearlink|1356}} in [[Impiltur]], where he used it to walk up to a wizard and cut them down in spite of their spells. Other adventurers later found his possessions soaked with blood in pedestals on a tor in the desolate wilderlands north of [[Impiltur]], with each pedestal bearing a chalked symbol; a circular spot devoid of blood in one empty pedestal suggested that ''Adriyana's Garter'' had been placed there.
