Jobinov was a spacefaring halfling bounty hunter.
A somewhat rotund man, Jobinov had slicked-back, black hair, and wore purple and black clothing.
Jobinov owned and carried a lasso.
After running away from his childhood home at the age of thirty-two, Jobinov was kidnapped by neogi slavers. He eventually escaped, but never thought of returning to a "groundling" existence again. On a visit to the world of Toril, Jobinov was taught to master the use of a lasso by a group of Tuigan warriors.
