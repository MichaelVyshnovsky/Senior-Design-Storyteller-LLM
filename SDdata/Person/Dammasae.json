As their trip began when she was eight months old, assuming Dammasae died less than eight months after starting the trip, her death would've occurred between Ches of 1340 and Ches of 1341; that span lies largely in 1340, and thus she's mostly certain to have died on that year.",

She was an enemy of the Cult of the Dragon, which sought to abduct her in order to explore and understand her spellfire.",

The pair adventured together for a time, fell in love, and married in [[Baldur's Gate]]. She settled down in [[Elturel]] during her pregnancy, birth, and raising the infant Shandril until she was eight months old. The couple and their baby left for [[Shadowdale]] afterwards, together with Gorstag, in order to look for [[Syluné]]. However, they were ambushed by forces from the Cult at the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]], where Dammasae was mortally wounded, almost certainly in the {{yearlinkName|1340}}.\n\nGorstag saw to it that she received some healing in [[High Horn]] afterwards, but it was insufficient; they could not reach Syluné in time.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|58}} this was a little knoll on the north side of the road, close to the road west of [[Toad Knoll]] that was sacred to Mystra.{{cite book/Hall of Heroes|47}}"
