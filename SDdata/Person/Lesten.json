Over a century prior, Buoyance had already proven his worth in another spell battle, where he slew Kartaklys. Lestens battle with Buoyance, however, was one of epic proportions. Elemental magic was fired this way and that, until there was only one victor Buoyance. Lesten had crumbled to ash. Following his demise, the other archwizards of Netheril talked about the grand spell duel until their empire fell."
