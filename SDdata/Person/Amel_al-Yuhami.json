        "mainbody": "Caliph Amel-al Yuhami, also called the Humble Servant of the Enlightened Gods, was the ruler of Fahhas in the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nThe caliph was an imposing figure with chiseled features. His height and broad shoulders made him appear more like a warrior than a moralist priest. He was believed to be one of the strongest men throughout the Pantheist League.\nAmel was temperamental and reclusive. He believed his fits of depression and melancholy were the result of the sins of the world and the death of his trusted mentor Jamila al-Muhib.\nAmel viewed everything, especially religious matters, in absolutes. Any crimes against the Law of the Loregiver within Fahhas were punished with the maximum sentence. He spent most of his time meditating in isolation.\nAmel wore an enchanted broach that prevented any genie from approaching within .\nThe caliph was quite close with his friend and mentor, Jamila, whose death greatly affected him."
