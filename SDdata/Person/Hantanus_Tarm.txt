'''Hantanus Tarm''' was the castellan of [[Goldenfields]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], like all castellans of Goldenfields, Tarm was appointed by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to lead the defense of the place, despite having no military experience. His position was a political and ceremonial one and he had no influence outside the gatehouse.
