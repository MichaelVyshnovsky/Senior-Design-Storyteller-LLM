        "mainbody": "'''Ottar''' was the first of the [[frost giant]] race.",
        "Description": "As [[jarl]] of the frost giant kingdom of [[Ostoria]], he wore a golden crown and bejeweled rings.",
        "Relationships": "Ottar was one of the many terrestrial sons of [[Annam All-Father]] and his wife [[Othea]]. His many siblings were his elder brothers [[Lanaxis]], [[Vilmos]], [[Nicias]], and [[Masud]], his younger brothers [[Obadai]], [[Ruk]], and [[Arno and Julian]], He had a half-brother through his mother named [[Dunmore]], as well as three other half-brothers through his mother whose names are forgotten to history. Through his father, he was half-sibling to the [[Giant pantheon|giant gods]] [[Stronmaus]], [[Hiatea]], [[Grolantor]], [[Iallanis]], [[Memnor]], and [[Skoraeus]]. He was likely related to the gods [[Surtr]] and [[Thrym]] as well.\n\nOttar was the father of [[Hrotun]], the first [[skald]] of the frost giants, and [[Hjurgen]], who went on to father the great hero [[Hjurnur Wyrmrever]].",
        "History": "Ottar was born sometime around {{Yearlink|-30000}}. When he and his terrestrial brothers came of age, Ottar's father, Annam, granted each of them an inheritance in the great giant empire of Ostoria.While it is not explicitly stated in the [[Perilous Gateways]] web source, it is reasonable to assume that [[Jhoth√ªn]] was the name of the sub-empire of [[Ostoria]] founded by Ottar. ruling as jarl, and his offspring became the frost giants.\n\nAfter many millennia, it was revealed that Ottar's mother Othea had had an affair with the sea god [[Ulutiu]] and that his younger brother Dunmore was probably not a full brother.\n\nWith all his poisoned brothers, Ottar was buried in a drumlin outside of Voninheim. There his body lay for about 3000 years until the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, when the [[firbolg]] [[Tavis Burdun]] unveiled the [[Twilight Vale]] and challenged Lanaxis. Lanaxis used powerful magic to reanimate Ottar's corpse as a [[zombie]], and he did the same with all of the other brothers. The [[undead]] giant kings attacked Tavis with the full fury of their magics, but he and his companions were protected by Annam's axe [[Sky Cleaver]]. Tavis then used the magic of Sky Cleaver to reveal to them, even in their undeath, that Lanaxis, their older brother, had betrayed them. Ottar was the first of the giant brothers for whom the magic was effective, and he immediately turned and charged at Lanaxis instead. His undead brothers then followed him. Lanaxis created a magic shield to protect the portico from their onslaught. Nicias was able to shatter the shield with his morning star, but then Lanaxis killed each of them a second time with his sword."
