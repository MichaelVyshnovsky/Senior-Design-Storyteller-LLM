        "mainbody": "Lorngar Roaringhorn was a member of the Roaringhorn noble family of Waterdeep in the early-to-mid 14 century DR.\nLorngar Roaringhorn once fought a spontaneous duel with Kelvar Helmfast in the Great Library of the House of the Moon temple to Sel√ªne in the late 1330s DR. They did substantial damage to the library, for which their respective families made reparations at many times the cost of the damage.The text of Powers & Pantheons discusses the prohibition of magic in the library, followed by talk of past duels, implying they were fought with magic. Since Kelvar is a fighter, it seems likely that Lorngar is a spellcaster."
