        "mainbody": "Umar al-Fennec was an orphan and street urchin who lived in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nUmar survived by stealing what he needed. He was wise in the ways of the streets and clever in general, allowing him to avoid serious confrontations with the city watch. He was eager for any information relating to the death of his parents.\nUmars parents were killed while adventuring when he was eight years old. After their death he lived with his uncle until the man abandoned him for parts unknown."
