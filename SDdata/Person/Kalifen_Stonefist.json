        "mainbody": "Kalifen Stonefist was a traveling monk, cleric, and a philosopher active in the 14 century DR.\nHis training gifted Kalifen with an introspective personality and a philosophical mind. He was a shy and donnish man.\nBy the age of eighteen, Kalifen had already spent a significant portion of his life traveling the world after departing his home, Stung Monastery in the Hills of Quai, in Bashan Do Province in Tu Lung. Throughout his life, Kalifen learned several types of martial arts, turning his body into a deadly weapon. One of the requirements of his faith, his religious duty, was roaming the world in order to learn the harsh realities of life.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, at the age of fifty-four, Kalifen Stonefist was among the ambitious adventurers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
