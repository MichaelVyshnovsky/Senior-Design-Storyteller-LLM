Rhammos was a member of the Risen Cult of Bane in the mid-14 century DR.Dragon #362 provides an exact date for the events of Halls of the High King, which did not give an exact date within itself.
Rhammos was capable of casting the spells  blindness, dispel magic, fireball, invisibility, magic missile, spider climb, wall of fire, and web.
Like his fellow wizards at the time, Rhammos possessed a set of robes, two daggers laced in sleep poison, and a ring of protection +4.
In 1359 DR, Rhammos was sent by the High Hands of the Risen Cult of Bane to kidnap High King Tristan Kendrick. He was accompanied by his fellow wizards, Thaundyl and Zelgos, as well as twelve priests, fourteen orcs, and eight battle horrors. However, their plans were thwarted by a group of adventurers and Harpers.
