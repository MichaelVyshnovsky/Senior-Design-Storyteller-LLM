        "mainbody": "'''Alavar''' was a [[harp]]ist of some renown, active sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "At some point before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Alavar was known for owning the ''[[Instrument of the Winds]]'', a unique [[enchanted]] [[musical instrument]] of sinister power. The magic harp captured souls of its past players, making the sounds produced by it especially haunting. At some point, the ''Instrument of the Winds'' captured the souls of both Alavar's parents, and he spent the rest of his life using the instrument and searching for a way to free the souls trapped within. It was unknown of Alavar's fate,"
