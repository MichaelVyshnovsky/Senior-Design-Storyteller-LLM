{{Quote|Uncle, you may have retired from the Fists, but your influence lives on â€“ today, your favorite nephew finally got his long-overdue promotion to Gauntlet!|Vildo}}

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Vildo followed his uncle's example and joined the [[Flaming Fist]] of Baldur's Gate. When the [[Absolute crisis]] struck the Gate, Vildo received his long-awaited promotion to the rank of Gauntlet, of which he eagerly informed his now-retired uncle via a letter. The nephew and his uncle were to meet at the [[Singing Lute]] in the Lower City to celebrate Vildo's promotion and watch the scenic sunset over the [[Seatower of Balduran]]. Vildo promised to get the "old man" back to his home before the uncle's bedtime.
