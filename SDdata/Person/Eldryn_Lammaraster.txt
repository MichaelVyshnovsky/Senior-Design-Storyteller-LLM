Eldryn Lammaraster, a Zulkir of Abjuration sometime circa late 1300 DR.
Eldryn was an old human Thayan man. He was bitter and paranoid. He was afraid of being back-stabbed by his many wanna-be successors. He was said to be more prepared for an attack and betrayal than a beholder.
The Zulkir of Abjuration layered his robes with many woven defensive magics. Eldryns specialization were automatically-triggered counterspells, many of which were unique spells developed by the bitter old man, and their secret formulae were taken to the grave with Eldryns death.
Eldryn Lammaraster took the position of the Zullkir of Abjuration sometime before the late . His name was among several zulkir names that became widely known after being named and described in the book called Twelve Winters Under the Lash, penned by an anonymous slave and smuggled out of Thay sometime in late 1300 DR.
