        "mainbody": "'''Guerik''' was an [[orc]] [[zombie]] in  [[Sildëyuir]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Guerik was an orc mercenary captain. He was recruited by the [[nilshai]] sorcerer [[Tolg'byri]] to conquer the [[Night Realm]] from [[Mourel Duskwalker]]. He became the second-in-command of the mercenary army after [[Savera]] took control of the group, killing Tolg'byri. However, continued exposure to the Night Realm's energies drove Guerik mad and he fled from the mercenary camp.\n\nHe decided to go alone to fight Mourel but was defeated and transformed into a zombie guarding the entrance point to the Night Realm."
