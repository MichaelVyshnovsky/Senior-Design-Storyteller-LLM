        "mainbody": "'''\"The krakentua\"''' was a [[krakentua]] who posed as the goddess of the village of [[Shinkintin]] on the [[Fochu Peninsula]] of [[Wa]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">No personal name or title has been given for this or any other krakentua.",
        "History": "Several centuries before, she was attacked and defeated by [[Za-Jikku]], a [[pan lung]] [[dragon]] and rogue officer of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] who caused much destruction in [[Kara-Tur]]. Za-Jikku also took one of her tentacles, which had been severed during the fight. The krakentua could not find her way to [[Qui]] to recover the valuable member.\n\nLater, around [[1347 DR|Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR)]], the krakentua had a titanic battle with more powerful spirits of the ocean. Badly wounded, she escaped to the [[Isle of Gargantuas]] to heal and recuperate.Using very similar wording, ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' page 180 gives the exact same event at around the same time for the [[krakentua (Isle of Gargantuas)|krakentua ruler]] of the Isle of Gargantuas, apparently implying it to be the same being. However, that krakentua is male, while the subject of this article is female, so here they are assumed to be separate beings. Taken together, it appears the two krakentua were companions in the battle before going separate ways. [[krakentua (Ito-jo)|A third krakentua]] (gender unknown) appears in the earlier ''[[Night of the Seven Swords]]'', also fleeing \"more powerful guardian spirits of the deep ocean\", but centuries earlier and going instead to [[Ito-jo]] in [[Kozakura]].\n\nAround [[1358 DR|Wa Year 1776 (1358 DR)]], she left the Isle and went to the Fochu Peninsula, seeking [[human]]s to worship her. There she enslaved the village of [[Shinkintin]], where the [[shoya]], a powerful [[wu jen]] transformed a stream to flow with cherry tree [[milk]] for her. But a rebellion quickly emerged and the krakentua destroyed the village. The surviving villagers offered their total devotion. They paid homage and tribute to \"the lady of the ocean\" when she visited their refugee camp on the beach twice a month.\n\nAfter six months, in 1776, if [[Osari Minhiro]] and his foreign adventuring party discovered Shinkintin and stayed to see her, she would offer her help against Za-Jikku, but not before testing them through a series of dangerous dreams."
