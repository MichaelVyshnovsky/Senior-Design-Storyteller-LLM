        "mainbody": "The '''Cosalla Huin To''' were two powerful spirits, appearing as twin children, who dwelt in the northern glades of the [[Quang Muku Forest]] in [[Koryo]], [[Kara-Tur]].\n\nThey lived and moved among the upper branches of the trees much like monkeys did, but often followed travelers in the forest. They merely played pranks on those who meant no harm to the wood, but punished those who invaded or despoiled the forest they watched over.\n\nWith their song, they could charm any animal or person, and they could summon any creature of the wood to the aid.",
