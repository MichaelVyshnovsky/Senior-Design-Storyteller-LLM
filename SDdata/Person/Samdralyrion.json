        "History": "In 1373 DR, Samdralyrion was among the [[metallic dragon]]s who wanted to find a cure for the Rage. He was a good ally of [[Chatulio]] and [[Karasendrieth]]. He decided to join a cabal of humanoid wizards in [[Thentia]] to study the Rage. However, when the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]] and the [[faerie dragon]] [[Jivex]] arrived in the city, Samdralyrion succumbed to the Rage and started attacking the wizards. The intervention of Taegan and Jivex saved the wizards but only at the cost of the brass dragon's life."
