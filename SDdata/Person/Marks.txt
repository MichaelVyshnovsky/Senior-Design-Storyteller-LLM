'''Marks''' was a [[human]] [[thief]] who was the proprietor of the [[Broken Pike]] tavern in the subterranean city of [[Skullport]] in [[Undermountain]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was short and mousy.

==Activities==
He had a habit of looking the other way when his regulars plotted their crimes in his tavern. In addition to running the tavern, Marks occasionally operated as a fence for the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] and was a crony of his regular patron and fellow fence, [[Thurn Blackskull]]. He was also reputed to be one of the few humans in Skullport who knew how to contact the [[Unseen]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1371}}, while searching for a [[greater doppelganger]] posing as [[Eidola Boareskyr]], [[Miltiades]] and [[Belgin Dree]] alongside [[Aleena Paladinstar]], forced their way into the Broken Pike in search of answers about the Unseen. They captured Marks with a ''[[lasso of truth]]'' and used its magical compulsion to have the man lead the paladins to a safe house of the Unseen. After Marks revealed the location of warding traps, he was knocked out by Miltiades.
