Marks was a human thief who was the proprietor of the Broken Pike tavern in the subterranean city of Skullport in Undermountain in the late 14 century DR.
He was short and mousy.
He had a habit of looking the other way when his regulars plotted their crimes in his tavern. In addition to running the tavern, Marks occasionally operated as a fence for the Xanathar Thieves Guild and was a crony of his regular patron and fellow fence, Thurn Blackskull. He was also reputed to be one of the few humans in Skullport who knew how to contact the Unseen.
In the , while searching for a greater doppelganger posing as Eidola Boareskyr, Miltiades and Belgin Dree alongside Aleena Paladinstar, forced their way into the Broken Pike in search of answers about the Unseen. They captured Marks with a lasso of truth and used its magical compulsion to have the man lead the paladins to a safe house of the Unseen. After Marks revealed the location of warding traps, he was knocked out by Miltiades.
