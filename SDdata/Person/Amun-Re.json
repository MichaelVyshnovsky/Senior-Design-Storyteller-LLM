        "mainbody": "Amun-Re was the last Pharaoh of the land of Bakar in the Raurin up until approximately the year . He had commissioned a theft-proof tomb, the Pyramid of Amun-Re. He called on Osiris to curse the river Athis out of existence upon his death though the god felt bound to carry out his bidding, he also cursed the Pharaoh not to enter heaven until his tomb was plundered.\nPer the Book of Amun-Re, the Pharaoh believed tomb accoutrements were necessary to make it possible to complete his trip to the afterlife. He often had nightmares as a boy that, were his tomb to be plundered, his funerary arrangements would not be sufficient to satisfy Osiris judgement. After personally examining the damage to his beloved fathers plundered tomb, he became traumatized, weeping tears of fury.\nThis led him to make war on his neighbors and heavily tax his own people in order to finance the construction. During a riot in the capital, approximately on the year , the Pharaoh called down a curse to threaten the rioting mob. In the name of his ruling staff, Osiris, and the Star of Mo-Pelar, were his heart to stop, then so would the spring of Athis.\nA spear came from the mob, striking the Pharaoh dead. Osiris was required to fulfill the Pharaohs curse, as it had been called in his name, but he did not accept his soul in the afterlife, for Amun-Res monument was supposed to be his people, not his tomb. He would not be able to enter his tomb and pass on until a mortal soul had taken away the implements by which he had called down this curse.\nAfter his death, Amun-Re was considered the greatest of the gods in heaven westward, for he manifested his own power in his own temple per the Tale of the Years of his priests, sacrifices of gold and food were made daily into the temple, and all that was placed in the Eastern temple disappeared, presumably claimed by Amun-Re.\nBy the mid-14 century DR, Amun-Re was an apparition in the area once covering the Kingdom of Bakar. Hed approach travelers every night, requesting that men of valor plunder the Ruling Staff and the Star of Mo-Pelar out of his tomb, so that he may pass on to the afterlife. The odds of being approached by the pharaoh were slim, but they were increasingly cumulative for as long as one remained in the area. Once one had been visited by the pharaoh, the apparition would repeat every night until they left Bakar. If they were within sight of the pyramid, the apparition would raise its arm to point that way.\nThe wizard Martek had given Amun-Re the Star of Mo-Pelar."
