        "mainbody": "Miquiztl Manik (roughly meaning \"hand of death\") was a Jaguar Knight of Kultaka in Maztica who led the Jaguar Guard mercenary company operating in Myratma in Tethyr in the mid–14 century DR.\nAfter the Kultakans aided in the Golden Legions conquest of Nexal in the , the leaders of Kultaka realized the continent of Maztica had been opened to foreign explorers and invaders. Therefore, they sent a group of their Jaguar Knights, led by Miquiztl Manik, to Faerûn to learn more about this new continent. Gar Hollan, a Myratman merchant, gave them transport and promised glorious battle if they went to Tethyr to fight as mercenaries for the Council of Myratma.\nAfter nearly the entire Council was assassinated by the Four in the , as part of the rise to power of Yusuf Jhannivvar, more than half of the Guard were also slain. Miquiztl had his warriors join the Loyalist Army of Zaranda Star. They battled the forces of the Pretender Prince, both by themselves and with the Loyalists.\nAfter the end of the Reclamation Wars in 1369 DR, the Jaguar Guard moved to garrisons around the ancient ruins of Shoonach and helped defend Tethyr against that evil place. They were still based in Myratma around 1372 DR.\nMiquiztl was a talented warrior and tactician. As a Jaguar Knight, he had various magical powers, such as transforming into a jaguar and enchanting stone weapons with talonblade. He fought with maca and shield and wore distinctive jaguar-skin armor.\nMiquiztl hoped to acquire land in Faerûn that they could settle and bring family and allies over from Maztica."
