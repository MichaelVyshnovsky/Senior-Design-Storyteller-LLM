'''Lessa Amyselnar''' was a [[human]] female [[priest]]ess of [[Tymora]] at [[The Lady's Favor]] temple in the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] in [[the Vast]].{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}

==History==
Lessa's father was a priest of Tymora, instilling his faith into daughter since she was young. Lessa followed him into the priesthood. She became a priestess at the temple of The Lady's Favor, which was built in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], under high priest [[Randolph dul Umast]].

On the [[Eleint 1]] in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], one of the hamlet's wells was [[poison]]ed, killing a few villagers and sickening twenty-two more. Lessa joined the other priests of Tymora in treating them but found that their magic could do nothing to identify or cure the poison, and they were forced to rely on non-magical treatments. Lessa trusted that Tymora and Umast would heal the sick.

==Abilities==
Lessa was a priestess of Tymora.

==Description==
Lessa had strawberry blonde hair, long enough to reach her waist, and dark blue eyes, but an otherwise unremarkable appearance. She was 5 feet and 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall.

==Possessions==
In combat, Lessa wore [[chainmail]] and fought with a footman's [[mace]]. She kept five vials of [[holy water]] and a holy symbol of Tymora.
