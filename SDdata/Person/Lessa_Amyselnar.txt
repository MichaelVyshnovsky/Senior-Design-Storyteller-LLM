Lessa Amyselnar was a human female priestess of Tymora at The Ladys Favor temple in the hamlet of Sevenecho in the Vast.
Lessas father was a priest of Tymora, instilling his faith into daughter since she was young. Lessa followed him into the priesthood. She became a priestess at the temple of The Ladys Favor, which was built in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, under high priest Randolph dul Umast.
On the Eleint 1 in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, one of the hamlets wells was poisoned, killing a few villagers and sickening twenty-two more. Lessa joined the other priests of Tymora in treating them but found that their magic could do nothing to identify or cure the poison, and they were forced to rely on non-magical treatments. Lessa trusted that Tymora and Umast would heal the sick.
Lessa was a priestess of Tymora.
Lessa had strawberry blonde hair, long enough to reach her waist, and dark blue eyes, but an otherwise unremarkable appearance. She was 5 feet and 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall.
In combat, Lessa wore chainmail and fought with a footmans mace. She kept five vials of holy water and a holy symbol of Tymora.
