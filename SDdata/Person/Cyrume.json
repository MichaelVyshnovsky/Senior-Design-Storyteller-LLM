        "mainbody": "Cyrume was a potter in Yhaunn who was secretly a member of the temple of Shar.\nIn early Eleasis of 1373 DR, he was sent on a mission by Variance Amatick to poison Stonecutters Well in the Stiltways, the goal being to cause the Sel√ªnites of Moonshadow Hall to become fearful of a Sharran cell in the city, as well as spread general chaos and death.\nBefore he could complete his task, he was caught by the priestess Feena Archwood, who ambushed him in her werewolf hybrid form. Knowing that escape was impossible, he chose to drink the flask of poison, dying in seconds while glorifying Shar.\nWhile Feena took the empty flask as proof of a Sharran presence in the city, Variance stripped Cyrumes corpse of its holy symbol of Shar and summoned a shadow mastiff to savagely maul it."
