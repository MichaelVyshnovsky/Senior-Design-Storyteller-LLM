        "mainbody": "Belkram was a member of the Harpers and one of the Rangers Three.\nBelkram was born in Baldurs Gate to sailors on the Dancing Dolphin ship. His parents were killed by pirates when Belkram was twelve years old and he decided to go adventure. He became the battle-buddy of Itharr, fighting some members of the Cult of the Dragon in Daggerford.\nAfter that battle, the Master Harper Osryk proposed that they join the Harpers and they agreed. They went to Berdusk for training but they did not fit well with Obslin Minstrelwish and decided to go on solitary adventures.\nIn 1358 DR, he was training together Itharr under Storm Silverhand in Shadowdale when Elminster Aumar and ranger Sharantyr entered a mysterious gate. Worried, Storm asked Itharr and Belkram to follow and lead them. They joined forces with El and Shar first to fight the Zhentarim in High Dale and later with the Rangers Three to contest the malaugryms plots during the Time of Troubles.\nBelkram was the hot-head of the group. He liked brawls and his preferred weapons were tables and chairs."
