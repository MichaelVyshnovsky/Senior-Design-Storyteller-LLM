Skittle, also known as the Great Collector or the Merchant of Mysteries among his furry kin, was a simple rat who prided itself for collecting great artifacts from the Flaming Fist prison and the barracks in the Basilisk Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Skittle was an unassuming male rat with brown coat.
The vermin merchant collected various spell scrolls and thieves tools, as well as a key from one of the Counting House secure vaults, and a single elixir of universal resistance.
In the , the rodent Merchant of Mysteries inhabited the Flaming Fist prison in the Basilisk Gate of Baldurs Gate. The rat scurried along the nooks and pipes of the prion and collected items it thought to be artifacts. Those capable of speaking with animals could convince the Great Collector to part with some of its erasure for coin.
