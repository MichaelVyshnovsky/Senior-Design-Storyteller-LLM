        "History": "Foxe was appointed as secretary and aide to the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] while he was a guest at the temple. In the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], he helped him with the writing of ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]'', negotiated with [[Forgemaster]] [[Inkstain]] for its printing, and kept his appointments with people such as Duke [[Jozul Piniago]]. During their time together, Foxe developed an interest in Koja's faith and learning inner harmony, but was not very good at it. He also had trouble understanding Koja's desire to have his book mass-published.\n\nWhen Koja decided to travel to [[Waterdeep]], he invited Foxe to accompany him.",
        "Relations": "Foxe was the eldest in his family. The [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] could not pronounce his family name, and so called him \"Firstborn Foxe\" in honor of this position.",
        "Description": "He was a portly man.",
