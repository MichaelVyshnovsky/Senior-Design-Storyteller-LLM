In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR, he helped him with the writing of A History of the Tuigan, negotiated with Forgemaster Inkstain for its printing, and kept his appointments with people such as Duke Jozul Piniago. During their time together, Foxe developed an interest in Kojas faith and learning inner harmony, but was not very good at it. He also had trouble understanding Kojas desire to have his book mass-published.\nWhen Koja decided to travel to Waterdeep, he invited Foxe to accompany him.\nFoxe was the eldest in his family. The lama Koja of Khazari could not pronounce his family name, and so called him \"Firstborn Foxe\" in honor of this position.\nHe was a portly man.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWorshipers of Deneir\nCategoryPriests of Deneir\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryAttendants\nCategoryInhabitants of the temple of Deneir in Procampur\nCategoryInhabitants of Procampur\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n43wq470ji9j0qzx02jvuvafv0izrbes"
