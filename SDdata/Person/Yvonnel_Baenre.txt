'''Yvonnel Baenre''', often known only as '''Matron Baenre''' or simply '''Baenre''', was the [[matron mother]] of [[House Baenre]] in the city of [[Menzoberranzan]]. She led her house and the city itself with an uncanny strength bred from deceitful ambition.

==Description==
Matron Baenre had lost much of the beauty she possessed while young; at the end of her life, she looked haggard, with a patchwork of wrinkles across her face and her hair was thin.

==History==
Yvonnel Baenre was born in {{Yearlink|-685}}.

Some time in the past, she encountered [[Gandalug Battlehammer]], the first king of [[Mithral Hall]], and his bodyguard [[Crowmower Pwent]]. During this confrontation, she managed to entrap Gandalug's soul in one of his teeth that had been knocked loose.

During the following two thousand years, she had many children and became the most powerful matron mother known to Menzoberranzan, with influences stretching across the [[Underdark]] and with so much of Lolth's favor bestowed upon her that she may have been rightly seen as Lolth's chosen prophetess. Several decades prior to her death, she oversaw the rise to power of [[House Do'Urden]], even going out on a limb (by drow standards) to help them defend their home while they continued their search for their blasphemous son [[Drizzt]] when they had little to no favor with Lolth.

At the very end of her life, she put into motion the plan she had been nurturing for two thousand years: an all-or-nothing assault upon Mithral Hall, the location, layout, and old defenses having been gleaned from the tormented spirit of Gandalug. Initially, things seemed to be going well. In [[1357 DR]], she ended up with Drizzt Do'Urden as her prisoner, but then [[Catti-brie]] rescued him with the aid of [[Artemis Entreri]] (and [[Jarlaxle]]). As a parting gift, they sent a heavy stalactite crashing through the house chapel during a ceremony wherein Lolth's blessing was asked for the invasion of Mithral Hall.

After that, the [[Time of Troubles]] hit [[Toril]] in [[1358 DR]], further stalling Matron Baenre's plans. During this time, she came close to losing her life when [[House Oblodra]] decided to abandon Lolth and attempted to conquer Menzoberranzan. With the [[balor]] [[Errtu]]'s aid (courtesy of a deal made by the goddess Lolth), she managed to wipe House Oblodra off the map (and into the [[Clawrift]]).

After the Time of Troubles ended, she led an army gathered from all houses in the city on her long-awaited conquest. Though they might have succeeded had drow not been drow, her plans were ruined by the valor of the defenders, dissent and desertion in her ranks, and by the unexpectedly successful headhunt by Drizzt's party. When Errtu's appointed general opened a chest with a [[Dead-magic zone|dead-magic]] [[gem]] inside, all magic failed and Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre fell to the floor from her [[glowdisc]] and was killed by an enraged [[Bruenor Battlehammer]].

In [[1484 DR]], Yvonnel's body was in the possession of her son, [[Gromph Baenre]]. Her head had been given to Gromph by Jarlaxle; the [[illithid]] [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]] used it to psychically absorb her personality and pass some of it on to Matron Mother [[Quenthel Baenre]], Yvonnel's daughter.

Gromph's child (with [[Minolin Fey]]) was to be named Yvonnel after his mother and groomed as Quenthel's (and thus Yvonnel's) successor.

==Relationships==
Yvonnel Baenre had twenty children in her life, fifteen of whom were priestesses. Her most notable children included Quenthel, the mistress of Arach-Tinilith and her eventual successor; [[Gromph Baenre|Gromph]], the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]]; [[Triel Baenre|Triel]], her immediate successor; and [[Jarlaxle]], her rogue son and leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. Other children included [[Doquaio Baenre|Doquaio]], [[Dantrag Baenre|Dantrag]], [[Bladen'Kerst Baenre|Bladen'Kerst]], [[Vendes Baenre|Vendes]], [[Sos'Umptu Baenre|Sos'Umptu]], and the youngest son [[Berg'inyon Baenre|Berg'inyon]].

During the last decade of her life, the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp served as Yvonnel's ''duvall'' (secret advisor).
