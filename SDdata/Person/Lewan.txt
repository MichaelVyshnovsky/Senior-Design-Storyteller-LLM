'''Lewan''' was [[Berun]]'s apprentice. An orphan from [[Murghom]] and a follower of [[Silvanus]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||1}}

==Appearance==
Lewan's skin was weathered by exposure to the elements and darker than [[Alaodin]]'s{{cite book/Sentinelspire||23}} but not as rich as [[Talieth]]'s.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||15}} He was tall and lean, but also strong.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||25}} Per [[Valmir]], he resembled a [[Murghom|Murghomi]] or [[Mulhorandi]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||7}}

==History==
Lewan was originally the child of farmers from Murghom. He was saved by Berun and [[Chereth]] after raiders from the [[Ganathwood]] slew his family on {{yearlink|1369}}.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||2}} The raid put him in a position where he mercy-killed his mother, which traumatized him intensely.

He remained with Berun until the age of seventeen,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||5}} while pursuing a tiger that had killed a shepherd.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||12}} Lewan fell unconscious from multiple injuries, and was taken to Sentinelspire for treatment.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||13}} He was treated as a guest of Lady Talieth there, even granted an opportunity to leave.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||14}} Talieth sought his aid in unlocking the powers of ''[[Erael'len]]'', an artifact that one of her hunters had taken from Berun, which the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] intended to use to destroy civilization throughout [[Faerûn]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||17}} Lewan remained unswayed, until he bonded with the servant [[Ulaan]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||19}}

However, after numerous days of attempting, he suspected that having lain with Ulaan on the night of the Jalesh Rudra may have rendered him unclean in the eyes of Silvanus.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||21}} Though he apologized to Ulaan for the implications,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||24}} he requested Lady Talieth that he be allowed to try and purify himself outside the fortress, and that Ulaan be freed from service once he succeeded.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||22}} While attempting a rite of purification, he was approached by the Old Man of the Mountain.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||23}} That night, he had a dream that Sentinelspire exploded in a supervolcanic eruption, decimating civilization throughout Faerûn. Before he could try again to unlock the power of ''Erael'len'', the fortress came under attack by Berun.

Lewan made an attempt to escape in the conmotion; he got into a fight with several Blades of the Old Man. In the process, Ulaan revealed was one of the Blades of Lady Talieth;{{cite book/Sentinelspire||37}} Nonetheless, he was brought to the Tower of the Sun by the [[killoren]] serving the Old Man.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||35}} There he learned that the Old Man of the Mountain he had spoken to while purifying himself was Chereth, Berun's master.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||37}} Chereth was frustrated that neither Lewan nor Berun would abide by his plans to destroy the world using the power of the fortress and ''Erael'len'',{{cite book/Sentinelspire||37}} and almost killed Ulaan to punish Lewan for this.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||40}}
