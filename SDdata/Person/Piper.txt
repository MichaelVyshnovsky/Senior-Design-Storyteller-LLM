'''Piper''' was a self-proclaimed prophet residing in [[Hilltop]].

He would constantly rant about prophecies that never seemed to come trueâ€”causing a great deal of stress to Mayor [[Veraunt Shuttlescomb]] and the village guards.

In [[1372 DR]], when [[Hol Halstrom]] called Piper a fool for claiming that death was coming to Hilltop, Piper was angered by this and proclaimed that Hol would die within the week. Halstrom turned up dead on the outskirts of the village just a few days later, nearly decapitated. Piper discovered Halstrom's body and added several wounds to the corpse, hoping to attract followers by claiming Hol's death was the cause of a new, unnamed god. In the wake of this and a [[kobold]] attack on Hilltop shortly after Halstrom's death, Piper attracted a small following and spread fear among the populace of the Hilltop.<ref>
