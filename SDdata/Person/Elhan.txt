Elhan was a commander of the armed forces of Suldanessellar.
The elf was a great fighter, making full use of his very high dexterity in combat. He owned Shazzellim, the intelligent scimitar, and an enchanted set of elven chainmail. He had many elven sages at his command, who he used to tell whether his enemies were telling the truth, or not. Despite wielding an evil sword, he hated those that associated with evil, such as vampires and drow.
In 1369 DR, when Gorions Ward came out of the Underdark, General Sovalidaas led him to Elhan. Elhan, naturally suspicious of the ward, made use of his sages to determine his intentions. After, he assured the ward that they were on the same side, and asked the ward to find the Rhynn Lanthorn.
