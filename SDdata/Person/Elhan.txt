'''Elhan''' was a commander of the armed forces of [[Suldanessellar]].

==Description==
The [[elf]] was a great fighter, making full use of his very high dexterity in combat. He owned ''[[Shazzellim]]'', the intelligent [[scimitar]], and an enchanted set of [[elven chainmail]]. He had many elven [[sage]]s at his command, who he used to tell whether his enemies were telling the truth, or not. Despite wielding an [[evil]] [[sword]], he hated those that associated with evil, such as [[vampire]]s and [[drow]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], when [[Gorion's Ward]] came out of the [[Underdark]], General [[Sovalidaas]] led him to Elhan. Elhan, naturally suspicious of the ward, made use of his sages to determine his intentions. After, he assured the ward that they were on the same side, and asked the ward to find the [[Rhynn Lanthorn]].
