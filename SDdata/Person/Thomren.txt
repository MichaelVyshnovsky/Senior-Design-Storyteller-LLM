==History==
Sometime around the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], Thomren lived as a druid at the circle of Thorngap. Unfortunately, the respected druid [[Halsaime]] became corrupted by the powers of the [[Halsaime's staff|strange staff]] that he received from [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]], becoming a destructive and malevolent force of nature. Thomren was one of the druids that joined his cause, either of his own accord or the powerful will that Halsaime exerted, and guarded [[Thorn Hollow]] with the local [[dire bear]]s until overcome by [[Harper]] agents sent from [[Eveningstar]] by [[Kirinel Zay]].
