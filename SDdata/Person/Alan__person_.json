He was buried in the [[Daggerford Graveyard]] just a couple of hours outside of the city walls, in the [[Eastern Farmlands]]. His grave was topped with a monument of a bigger size than the most in the south-eastern corner of the gated land a stone's throw away from a stream that eventually joined [[Delimbiyr River]]. By 1372 DR, Alan's grave marker was still in good condition with the engravings clearly readable."
