        "mainbody": "Lord Irlar was a servant of Bane and a suitor to Alustriel. After he attempted to kidnap her, she slew him.\nIrlar was forceful, scornful, and demanding. Per Alustriel, he was almost certainly a coward, too.\nHe had a dagger.\nHe wanted Alustriels hand in her appreciation, it was mostly so he would inherit Bluetower from her uncle, as he had often been cruel and dismissive with her.\nWhile Alustriel was living in her uncles manor, Irlar was a guest at least once. In a shieldmeet of either 770 or 774, he already hated Harpers, and Alustriel for having the blood of one, as well as for practicing magic.\nOn Uktar 10 of , Lord Irlar rode to Bluetower to court Alustriel, together with a pomp of men in finery. He found no objection from her uncle Thamator, and remained their guest for two evenings on Uktar 12 he announced over dinner his intention to take her in the evening she assumed it was to a temple of Bane, where he would force her forswear Mystra and then conceive Irlars child.\nWhen he came to her room in the middle of the night, Alustriel struck him first, using her magic (which was meager at the time). Rather than flee her chambers he fought her, and after a long and deadly struggle, she finally threw him out of the window. That killed him."
