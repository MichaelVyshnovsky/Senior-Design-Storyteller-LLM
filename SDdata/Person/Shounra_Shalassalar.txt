Shounra Shalassalar was the "Night Fingers", or ruler, of the thieves guild known as the Worms in Zhentil Keep in 1358 DR.
All members of the Worms reported to Shounra in one way or another. To keep her identity hidden from the public eye, Shounra posed as a pleasure queen.
The Night Fingers reported all relevant information they collected to certain lords of the Council. Shounras real master was Manshoon.
After the fall of Zhentil Keep in 1368 DR, the Worms eventually disbanded but Shounra tried to recreate the organization.
 In 1370 DR she worked under Lord Payradar.
