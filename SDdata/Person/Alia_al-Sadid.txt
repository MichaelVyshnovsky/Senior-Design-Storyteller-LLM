Alia al-Sadid was a half-elven kahin and member of the House of Thawr tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Disturbed by her fathers obsession with his vision of sweeping through the Pearl Cities, Alia confronted the tribes elders about the possibility of new leadership with the best interests of the tribe at heart. This suggestion was received with mixed emotions. Alia even offered to do this task herself and vowed to lead the tribe back to safety deeper in the desert.
Alia was the only surviving child of her father.
