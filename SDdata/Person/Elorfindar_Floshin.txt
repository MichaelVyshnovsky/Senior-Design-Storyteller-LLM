'''Lord Elorfindar Floshin''' was a [[sun elf]] who spent most of his life guarding the ''[[portal]]s'' of the [[Ardeep Forest]]. He lived in a [[Floshin Estates|grand estate]] close to the [[House of Long Silences]], not far from the settlement of [[Daggerford]].

==Possessions==
Though he rarely had reason to enter battle, Elorfindar owned many [[magic item]]s. He owned a suit of ''[[Chainmail|elven chain mail +4]]'', a ''[[shield|shield +2]]'', a [[ring of protection|''ring of protection +2'']] as well as a ''[[ring of wizardry]]'', a massive collection of [[ioun stones|''ioun stones'']], and a [[luckstone]].

Elorfindar additionally owned several magical weapons, including a ''[[longbow]] +3,'' along with several [[arrow|magical arrows]], a ''[[dancing sword|dancing longsword]]'', and even a ''[[staff of the magi]]''. One of his most prized possessions was his [[Intelligent item|sentient]] longsword which was called ''[[Elfhost]]''.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|4}}

==Activities==
Throughout his tenure as protector of the ''portal nexus'' of the Ardeep, Elorfindar established a network of [[ward]]s and spells that offered him advanced notice of anyone attempting to intrude upon his woods.

==Relationships==
Elorfindar remained with his elven wife for over six hundred years, until her death some time before the late–12{{th}} century [[DR]]. [[Shalendra Floshin|Shalendra]], and [[Elorshin Floshin|Elorshin]].

In the two centuries after her death, Elorfindar married three different [[human]] women from among the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]], and has had a number of [[half-elven]] children with them.

He was the great-grandfather of [[Kiratha]]. 

He was a distant relative of [[Araevin Teshurr]].

==History==
In his youth, Elorfindar experienced the formation of [[Phalorm|Phalorm, the Realm of Three Crowns]], the great 6{{th}} century kingdom of the [[West Faerûn|west]] that united elves, [[dwarves]], and [[human]]s. His fellow elves of the Ardeep remained untied with the dwarves of [[Dardath]] and the men of [[Delimbiyran]] for over a century. After the armies of the kingdom were destroyed by the [[lich]] known as [[Iniarv]], the elves of the Ardeep abandoned considered their trial of a racially diverse kingdom to be ill-advised.

Elorfindar did not leave his home and held on to the hope of a united realm  that comprised elves, dwarves, and men. He led the efforts for hundreds of years to create a new Phalorm, but ultimately failed as the human kingdom of Delimbiyran broke apart and the nearby dwarfholds were abandoned.

Elorfindar genuinely believed it was his duty to guard the ''portal nexus'' in the House of Long Silences within the Ardeep Forest as penance for the betrayals of his ancestors. The actions of his forebears led to the formation of one of the groups of [[fiend]]ish [[Fey'ri]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}}

In an effort to still aid the humans of the region, Elorfindar spent his many years dedicating himself to the remaining human settlement in the region, the small town of Daggerford. For over 400 years he served as advisor and friend to the numerous noble dukes that led the town,

During his later years, in the 14{{th}} century DR, Elorfindar rarely left Floshin Estates.

Circa the {{YearlinkName|1468}}, Elorfindar died and the estate was left to his eldest son Darfin. His final actions involved the study of the forsaken House of Long Silences, believing he had one last attempt to restore the glory he had experienced in his youth.
