'''"The Father of Spiders"''' was the nickname given to a [[deepspawn]] speculated to exist within [[Adhe Wood]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|13}}

The [[sage]] [[Alither]] studied the legends of Adhe Wood and believed that the many mutant [[spider]]s there were produced by a diseased or magically altered deepspawn, which was dubbed "the Father of Spiders".
