Gib Reltub was a powerful elven thief and champion, active in the 14 century DR.
Reltub was an average man in appearance, who wielded a sword and wore a set of chainmail armor.
Beyond his impressive roguish skills, Reltub was a powerful arcane spellcaster and an earthwalker, who could freely traverse different lands and worlds. He had access to such powerful magics as the wish spell, which could not be countered or turned by his opponents.
