Renim was a drow from Szith Morcane in the late 15 century DR.
In the late 15 century DR, Renim was one of the drow that needed to meet the smuggler Arrizz in order to receive the shipment of supplies procured by Arrizz.
However, at the meeting point, an abandoned shrine to Blibdoolpoolp near the Waydown, she and her fellows were attacked by mad kuo-toa worshipers of the cambion siblings Gattash and Rashara.
Renim and three other drow were captured in order to use them as sacrifices.
