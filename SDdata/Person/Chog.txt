Chog the Yellow was one of the two Cloakmasters of Keczulla for the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Previously, Chog was the guildmaster of fences for the Shadow Thieves in the city.
However, he proved absolutely inept in the Cloakmasters role Chog so badly mismanaged his half of the town that the Shadow Council was likely to soon eliminate and replace him. To avoid this outcome, Chog considered many wild schemes to somehow discredit the other Cloakmaster or "rescue" the city from a calamity engineered by himself.
