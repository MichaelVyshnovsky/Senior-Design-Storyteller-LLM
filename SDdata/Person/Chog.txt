'''Chog the Yellow''' was one of the two Cloakmasters of [[Keczulla]] for the [[Shadow Thieves]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Previously, Chog was the guildmaster of fences for the Shadow Thieves in the city.

However, he proved absolutely inept in the Cloakmaster's role: Chog so badly mismanaged his half of the town that the [[Shadow Council]] was likely to soon eliminate and replace him. To avoid this outcome, Chog considered many wild schemes to somehow discredit the other Cloakmaster or "rescue" the city from a calamity engineered by himself.
