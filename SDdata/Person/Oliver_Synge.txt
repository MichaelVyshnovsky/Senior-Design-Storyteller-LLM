'''Oliver Synge''' was a merchant who operated on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Synge was of the [[Calishite]] ethnicity.

==History==
On [[Eleasis 26]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},<ref group="note">While this year is not explicitly stated, it is inferred from the date given in the "Dark Journal" and the "Moonhaven Logbook". Presumably, Ilyn Toth wrote each document over the course of the same time. Synge spent one day in the small village of [[Moonhaven]]. The merchant returned later on [[Nightal 14]], but merely passed through the town. Synge's activities were observed by the paranoid, exiled [[Red Wizard]] [[Ilyn Toth]].
