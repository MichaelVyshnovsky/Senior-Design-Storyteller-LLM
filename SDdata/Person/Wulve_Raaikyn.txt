'''Wulve Raaikyn''' was a [[halfling]] [[thief]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Wulve was a recent addition to Waterdeep as of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. He came to the city posing as a textiles trader, but really only wanted to pocket some [[gold]] and [[magic item]]s before returning east with a wagon full of [[turnip]]s. Wulve often targeted sleeping [[adventurer]]s and had multiple escape routes planned in the rare event that he was caught picking one of their pockets.
