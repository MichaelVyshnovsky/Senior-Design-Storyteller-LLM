'''Dubilitop''' was the leader of a group of [[brownie]]s that were originally nomadic within the [[Pasocada Basin]] in [[Maztica]], but settled in [[Kin Elbhaz]]. Unknown to the settlement's inhabitants, the brownies took care of the crops and ensured that the area was kept as disease-free as possible, in exchange for taking grain from the store via a secret passage.

==Equipment==
Dubilitop fought with a tiny [[bow]] or a [[shortspear]].
