        "Activities": "Pan Chu, a [[Kozakuran]] of [[Shou]] ancestry, was the most feared of the wako pirate admirals. He usually took no prisoners and saved only captured ship adapted for war. His ship was the ''[[Golden Lily]]'', a [[junk|war junk]] with a mixed crew of wako from Kozakura, [[Wa]], and [[Shou Lung]]. Pan Chu was very efficient in his pirate raids and nobody had yet captured him.\n\nThe ''Golden Lily'' regularly docked in [[Yoetsu]]. Captain Pan Chu and other wako captains were often be found in the [[sake]] shops and establishments along the waterfront, making them accessible for contact and business dealings."
