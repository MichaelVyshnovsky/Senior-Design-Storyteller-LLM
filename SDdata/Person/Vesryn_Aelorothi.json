        "mainbody": "'''Vesryn Aelorothi''' was a [[fey'ri]] [[sorcerer]] of [[House Aelorothi]] of [[Siluvanede]] and a member of the [[daemonfey]] in the early 1370s [[DR]] .",
        "Description": "He was incredibly tall but also so slender as to be skeletal. He had dark copper-hued hair. Although quite fiendish in his true form, he adopted a mundane appearance more of the time. He favored a [[moon elf]] of noble aspect and quiet manner and [[human]] sorcerer with portly build and wild, white-blond hair.",
        "Powers": "As a fey'ri, Laelran had the powers to cast ''[[detect thoughts]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]'' once a day each, and was resistant to fires and mundane weapons.",
        "History": "Following the liberation of the daemonfey in [[1369 DR]], Vesryn quickly pledged himself to [[House Dlardrageth]] and the daemonfey, and swore his obedience to Countess [[Sarya Dlardrageth]].\n\nIn the early 1370s DR, he was based at a daemonfey bolthole along the northern edge of the [[High Forest]] along with [[Teryani Ealoeth]] and few other daemonfey of their scouting party.\n\nAfter the death of [[Nurthel Floshin]] in [[1374 DR]], Sarya promoted Vesryn as her new spymaster, thanks to his knowledge about modern [[Faerun]].\n\nAfter losing the [[Cormanthor War]], he, alongside most of the remaining fey'ri, tried to escape inside the [[Waymeet]] but at last was killed in the fighting.",
        "Activities": "He readily made himself available to serve the Dlardrageths' plans, usually taking part in raids or scouting missions.",
        "Personality": "Vesryn possessed gracious and courteous manners but also exquisite cruelties. He believed fully in Sarya Dlardrageth's plans and enjoyed carrying out her orders.",
        "Equipment": "Vesryn wielded a magical ''+1 [[longsword]]'', wore ''+1 [[elven chain]]'' and a ''[[ring of counterspells]]'' (''[[magic missile]]''), and equipped with two ''[[potion]]s of [[cure moderate wounds]]'', a ''potion of [[neutralize poison]]'', a ''[[scroll]] of [[flashburst]]'', a ''scroll of [[lesser ironguard]]'', a ''[[wand]] of [[Melf's acid arrow]]'', two [[waterstar]]s (500 gp each), and a hand-drawn map of the [[North]] kept in a leather scroll case.\n\nHe had a [[bat]] [[familiar]]."
