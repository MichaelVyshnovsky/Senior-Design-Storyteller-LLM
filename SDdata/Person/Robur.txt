==History==
Robur served the maddened [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] and oversaw the plant overgrowth in Uthe Lodge, around the time of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]]. It was accompanied by the wood woads [[Falcata]] and [[Prinus]], and the [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]], who was the source of the plant growth in the building.
