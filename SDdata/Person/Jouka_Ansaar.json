        "mainbody": "'''Jouka Ansaar''' was a wainwright from the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]] who worked for the town's farm goods distributor, [[Sejellus Krimp]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Jouka Ansaar was a muscular and stoic fellow who worked hard and diligently.",
        "History": "By [[1372 DR]], Jouka Ansaar was a busy and well-paid wainwright, working day and night preparing Sejellus Krimp's trade wagons, patching up passing caravans, and building new wagons out of old parts. He was deeply appreciated by all of his clients and they gladly paid him highly for his hard work.\n\nWith [[Gillian's Hill]] often being raided by the [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Lizard Marsh]], Jouka's workshop was often affected as these wild humanoids grabbed anything to affixed to place and things that even remotely resembled weapons. During one of lizardfolk raids, Jouka Ansaar's family \"heirloom\" of sorts, a [[silver]]-plated awl, was snatched and carried away. The wainwright was not a daring fighter, so he asked the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to retrieve the item in case they were heading into the Marsh."
