        "mainbody": "Lai \"Line\" Antolio was a giantslayer and skilled maker of contraptions who roamed around the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.\nLai was quite a high-strung individual, being a perfectionist when it came to his contraptions. Most of his time was spent thinking his next trap or technique for giantslaying.\nSome time after the shattering of the Ordning in 1485 DR, when the Savage Frontier became a hotbed of squabbling giant activity, Lai joined up with two other adventurers to form a giantslayer organization &mdash Hook, Line, and Sinker."
