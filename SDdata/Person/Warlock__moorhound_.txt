'''Warlock''' was a large, strong [[moorhound]] owned by [[Angus Blackstone]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, [[Currag Blackstone]] set Warlock and the pack of moorhounds on an old man who had approached the gate of the manor. With a spoken command, the man was able to stop the pack of moorhounds and with another, they fled, inexplicably jumping a {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes}} tall palisade.
