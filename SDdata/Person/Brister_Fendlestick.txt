Brister Fendlestick was a human wizard of the early 14 century DR.
He traveled the Underdark in his magical iron tower (a Daerns instant fortress), which he carried with him wherever he traveled.
In the , Fendlestick polymorphed a pech into the hook horror known as "Clacker." Clacker was then returned to Brister by Drizzt DoUrden and Belwar Dissengulp in order to reverse the spell, but before the transformation could be completed, Clacker lashed out and killed Fendlestick.
The cave where Fendlestick was killed had a fast-moving stream and was known as Fendlesticks Folly.
