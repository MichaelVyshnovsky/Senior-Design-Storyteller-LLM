        "mainbody": "Lord Ildool was the Crowns representative in Marsember, Cormyr. He was widely distrusted because of his alleged dishonesty about taxes, and the Harpers were keeping him in check. Ildool lived at the Kings Tower. He often met with trade delegations from other states such as Sembia, and he was rumoured to be on friendly terms with Thay. Ildool was also rumoured to use the apparently disused shrine to Waukeen as a covert meeting place. He was replaced by Bledryn Scoril after he died sometime between 1368 DR and 1372 DR.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants of Marsember\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryLords and ladies\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\niq3wjiwa14wkiq17p1g07vbspwmymth"
