He was widely distrusted because of his alleged dishonesty about taxes, and the [[Harpers]] were keeping him in check. Ildool lived at the [[King's Tower]]. He often met with trade delegations from other states such as [[Sembia]], and he was rumoured to be on friendly terms with [[Thay]]. Ildool was also rumoured to use the apparently disused shrine to [[Waukeen]] as a covert meeting place. He was replaced by [[Bledryn Scoril]] after he died sometime between [[1368 DR]] and [[1372 DR]].",
