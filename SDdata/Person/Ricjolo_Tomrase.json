        "mainbody": "'''Ricjolo Tomrase''' was the Baron of [[Sespech]] whose reign ended in [[1364 DR]], succeeded by Baron [[Thuragar Foesmasher]].",
        "History": "Ricjolo Tomrase was notoriously known for being a puppet leader of Sespech, a barony of Chondath, before its secession in the ballot of the [[Rotting Wars]]. The man was controlled by [[Arrabar]], to the great displeasure of his subjects. In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Ricjolo's reign ended after ex-adventurer Thuragar Foesmasher rose to power through a series of bloody assassinations and courtly intrigues. When the new Baron's grab or power was successful, Foesmasher ordered Ricjolo Tomrase to return to his masters in Arrabar. Ricjolo's exile led to a small battle between the armies of Sespech and Chondath in a small village of [[Arranford]] but resulted in Sespech's long-desired true independence."
