Ali ben Ali was an inhabitant of the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire in 1367 DR.
Ali was just as famous for his somber demeanor as he was for his magical prowess.
Ali was a pauper. As such he was quite disheveled and filthy.
Renowned in Zakhara for his precise visions of the future, Ali traveled to the City of Brass 20 years ago with the hopes of becoming the Great Sultans personal councilor. It wasnt until then that Ali discovered his abilities as an accomplished mystic did not work for genies. Amused by Alis antics, the Sultan had him blinded and cast out of his court.
Ali wandered the streets and markets of the City of Brass, struggling to earn a living by telling travelers fortunes.
