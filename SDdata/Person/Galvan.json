        "mainbody": "'''Galvan''' was the Blue Dragon Wyrmspeaker in the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] of [[Severin Silrajin]].",
        "Personality": "Galvan thought very much like a scheming [[blue dragon]]. He was also [[Talis Kasterel]]'s mentor and saw Severin as a man of great vision and destiny, and thus would never act against him.",
        "History": "Galvan was born in [[Thay]] and had aspirations to be a [[Red Wizard]] but his magic skill was not great enough. He joined the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and served for a long time. When Severin entered the Cult, Galvan saw him as a charismatic leader and soon allied with him. He always maintained contacts among the Red Wizards and under Severin's leadership Galvan acted as a link between the two groups. There was a secret family connection between him and [[Rath Modar]], the lead Red Wizard allied with the Cult. Galvan also plotted against [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] hoping to acquire or destroy her [[dragon's orb]]."
