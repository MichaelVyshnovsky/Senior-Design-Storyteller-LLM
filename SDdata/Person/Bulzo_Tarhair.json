        "mainbody": "'''Bulzo Tarhair''' was a master [[thief]] who lived in the city of [[Tyraturos]], within the [[Tyraturos (tharch)|tharch of the same name]], in [[Thay]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a knowledgeable older rogue, who possessed at least a little bit of information about the most of the important personalities of southern Thay and had very strong opinions about the nations lack of laws.",
        "Description": "Bulzo kept a cheery disposition and had the annoying habit of moving just out of the eye line of whomever he was around. As of [[1357 DR]], his hair had begun to go gray.\n\nHe was not particularly happy with the sort of lawlessness that was prevalent in Thay. As any good thief should, Bulzo wanted to know exactly which laws he was breaking in his activities.",
        "Activities": "The slightly older thief had a strong fascination with adventurers and their lifestyle. He regularly offered his services to aid any adventurers he met throughout his travels, and genuinely helped their endeavors. However, he always left with a small memento from them, in addition to any payment offered, as a reminder of the experience.",
        "History": "Prior to his career in crime, Bulzo spent time as an adventurer, and went on a number of expeditions with the [[tharchion]] of [[Pyarados (tharch)|Pyarados]], [[Valerios Theokillos]].\n\nDuring the 1350's, Bulzo and his fellow halflings engaged in a healthy competition with the human thieves of Tyraturos. Fortunately for the [[Hin]] rogues, they had allies in the city of [[Bezantur]].",
        "Possessions": "Among his other possessions, Bulzo had a ''[[ring of invisibility]]''."
