'''Three-Piece''' was a member of [[the Guild]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Guild reinstated tethered knife fights to its members delight. The fights were held until the first blood. [[Babyjowls]] and Three-Piece had at least one fight and were scheduled for a rematch sometime during the [[Absolute crisis]] in Baldur's Gate. Bursar [[Uktar (The Guild)|Uktar]] collected bets and dispensed winnings.
