'''Forestarm Trienne''' was a [[ranger]] of [[Mielikki]] in [[Quaervarr]] in [[1484 DR]].
 
==History==
After [[Highharvestide]] of 1484 DR, a supposed [[phantom]] started to appear in the village. Trienne was greatly concerned about it and her ranger friends of [[Glimmerwood]] told her that the phantom had also appeared outside Quaervarr and mostly followed a path to the ruin of [[Methegrist]].
