'''Elissa Tarixon''' was the mysterious Queen who ruled the [[amazon]] isle of [[Ixinos]] off the coast of the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Elissa ruled her island of reclusive amazon warriors ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. However, her total reign length was a mystery, like so many other things about Ixinos. The port city of [[Tazixor]] was the only known settlement under Queen Elissa's control, and during her rule, the island did not allow visitors and did not participate in diplomatic relations with any other nations of the Vilhon Reach.
