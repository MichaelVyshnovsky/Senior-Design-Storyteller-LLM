Ysgarda was a page of Candlemas, the High Steward of Delia, in the Netherese Empire circa .
The girl had deep blue eyes and short black hair.
Ysgarda acted very flighty and nervous around powerful figures, such as Candlemas.
When working for the High Steward, Ysgarda wore a white and black outfit.
Her father managed the dovecotes in Delia for Lady Polaris.
During the Shadowed Age, the nine-year-old page informed Candlemas that members of the Beneficent Traders Guild of Dalekeva, also known as Oberons Hold, wished to speak to him about a growing problem.
