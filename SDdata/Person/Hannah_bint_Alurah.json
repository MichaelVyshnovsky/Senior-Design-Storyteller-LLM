        "mainbody": "Hannah bint Alurah was a paladin and princess of Hiyal around 1367 DR.\nConsidered by many to be the white sheep of the royal family, Hannah was both caring and considerate. Because of her siblings manipulations, Hannah was inherently suspicious, bordering on hostile, toward strangers.\nHannah was the Marshall of the City Guard. As a whole, the citizens of Hiyal admired Hannahs just demeanor and quest to keep the city in order.\nHannah was the daughter of Sultana Alurah bint Asrah. She feared her mother would pass away without naming an heir, plunging the city into chaos."
