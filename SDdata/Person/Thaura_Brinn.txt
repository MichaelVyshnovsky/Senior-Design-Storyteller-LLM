{{Quote|And yes, I say again, whether the High House will sanciton it or no â€• to study the very flame of creation is worth it, even should the fires consume us.|''Excerpt from Thaura's contribution to [[Fringe Philosophy]]''.}}

==Personality==
She subscribed to some theories regarding magic and arcana that were deemed unconventional and too extreme by others.

==History==
Before her rise within the [[church of Gond]], Thaura lived a simple life on a farm. She spent some of her time watching the earthmotes pass across the sky, daydreaming about their nature and origin.

Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, High Artificer Brinn contributed some of her theories to the fifth volume of ''[[Fringe Philosophy]]''. In the publication, she theorized that the [[earthmote]]s of the Realms were connected to the ancient [[Netherese enclave|flying cities]] of ancient [[Netheril]]. She believed that her fellow Gondar devotees were trying to censor her writings, specifically for publishing them outside official Gondar journals.
