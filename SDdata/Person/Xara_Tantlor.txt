Xara Tantlor was a wizard and shopkeeper of the Shining Scroll in Silverymoon in 1370 DR.
Xara worked as a wizard-for-hire but also managed a potion shop. All this was to fund her explorations of ruins and tombs in interior Faer√ªn.
Xara lived with a faerie dragon companion named Villynk, who considered herself the true owner of the shop.
Xara wore a mithral shirt that allowed her to move silently.
