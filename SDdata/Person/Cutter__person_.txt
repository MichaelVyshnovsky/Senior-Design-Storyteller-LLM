'''Lord Cutter''', previously known as '''Ravendas''', was a ruthless and power hungry agent of the [[Zhentarim]] and briefly the puppet tyrant of [[Iriaebor]]. 

==History==
After traveling to [[Baldur's Gate]] in order to learn martial skills, Ravendas's lust for power led her to [[Darkhold]], where she sought membership in the Zhentarim. [[Sememmon]] himself gave her a task that she completed with ruthless efficiency, rising quickly through the organization's ranks.

In about [[1355 DR]], the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]], which included her sister [[Kera]] and her lover [[Caledan Caldorien|Caledan]], captured Ravendas after defeating her army at [[Hluthvar]]. Once she was alone with Kera, Ravendas convinced her [[Harper]] sister to release her and then strangled her with the bonds that previously held her.https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1229054227776966661

In [[1362 DR]], Cutter and her Zhentish forces conquered the city of [[Iriaebor]], gaining control of the city and its trade routes. While looting Iriaebor of its valuables, Cutter sought and eventually found the crypt of the [[Shadowking]] deep beneath the city.

==Description==
Cutter was beautiful and tall with pale skin, dusky eyes and pale gold hair cut to shoulder-length.

==Relationships==
While she counted the rest of the Zhents among her allies, Cutter's enemies included [[Caledan Caldorien]], [[Mari Al'maren]], and the rest of the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]].
