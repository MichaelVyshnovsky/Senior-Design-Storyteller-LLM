        "mainbody": "'''Harfang''' was a sailor and the Captain of the ''[[Lustrous Lass]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Harfang was gaunt-faced [[half-orcish]] woman with a clean-shaven head.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Captain Harfang sailed the ''Lustrous Lass'' to the [[Crone Island]], where she made a deal with the [[Gloom Crone]]. For days after, Captain Harfang was the hairiest she'd ever been. She was granted \"enough gold to last the rest of her life,\" but soon enough, the Captain realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold [[coin|pieces]] among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, Harfang came down with an illness. She heard a creature scurrying and scratching in her baggage that sounded bigger than just a [[rat]]. Harfang locked herself away in her cabin trying to stay away from the creature, in reality a cursed [[imp]] that spread the [[disease]], and to isolate the sickness. But that was no use as the [[sea plague]] ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a [[tenday]] after the hag deal was made.\n\nThe bodies of the dead, including Captain Harfang, were left aboard the ''Lustrous Lass'' and quarantined by the [[Flaming Fist]] after the ship drifted into the harbors of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
