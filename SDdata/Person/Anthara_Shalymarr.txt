'''Anthara "Softangles" Shalymarr''' was a [[Mulhorand]]i woman living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. She was a former [[thief]] and later a [[tavern]]keeper and proprietress of the [[Scarlet Sheath]] tavern.

==Description & Personality==
Anthara was tall and sinuous of build, with dark eyes. She was also hot-tempered, and often hurled a dagger into too-lusty patrons.

She operated it under three firmly held principles: that a tavern should provide comfortable furniture and swift service; that tapestries could conceal holes or burn marks in the walls; and that it should be separate from daily matters, where people could talk freely. Anthara had an agreement with Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]], ruler of Wheloon, that no one could be held accountable for things said in the Scarlet Sheath.

==History==
Anthara was once a thief in Mulhorand, but retired and later came to Wheloon in Cormyr. There, she took over an abandoned, ruined building, turning it into the Scarlet Sheath tavern by [[1358 DR]]. She still ran it by [[1369 DR]].
