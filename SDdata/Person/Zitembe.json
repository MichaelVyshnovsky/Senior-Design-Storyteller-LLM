        "mainbody": "Zitembe (), known as Grandfather Zitembe, was the head priest of the temple of Savras in Port Nyanzaru during the late 1480s or early 1490s DR.\nZitembe could conduct a ritual which could grant him visions from Savras relating to questions asked by visitors to the temple. He referred to this as \"consulting the guides\".\nDuring the events of the death curse in the late 15 century DR, Zitembe was granted visions that allowed him to know that the curse stemmed from the city of Omu. At the same time, he had to contend with pressure from agents of the Zhentarim who wanted his help to scry the location of Artus Cimber and the Ring of Winter, however he refused for fear of helping such evil individuals.\nFollowing the end of the death curse, Zitembe was granted a vision from Savras which alerted him to the machinations of the yuan-ti abomination Kressvoon, who was plotting to recreate the death curse in Orolunga with a device called the Death of the Sun."
