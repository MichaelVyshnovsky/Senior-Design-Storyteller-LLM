        "mainbody": "Uncle was what some called a particular reclusive wizard who owned a keep in the Kryptgarden Forest on the Sword Coast North. After his death, he left his keep to a relative who was either his niece or nephew.\nThe wizard known as Uncle was a recluse who did not maintain contact with people outside his keep, even family. He was also conscious about security, as he filled his moat with invisible spears and had a secret escape route out of his keep.\nThe wizards most significant possession was Uncles Keep, a modestly sized but well-decorated building in the southern end of the Kryptgarden Forest. In his keep, he kept a number of guards and servants. He also had a stable full of livestock, which included a pony.\nHe owned a magical mirror that could cause someone to be enthralled by their own reflection. He owned many other magic items, including enchanted weapons.\nBefore his death, the wizard lived a somewhat solitary life in his keep although he made regular visits to Red Larch.\nThe wizard had few relatives. He was married to a woman from Red Larch,\nHe occasionally thought about his distant niece or nephew, to whom he was considered long-lost, and who inherited his estate after his death.\nHis keep made him a target of the Lostafinga tribe of hobgoblins.\nAbout five years before his death, the wizard saved the life of a lord of Waterdeep, who repaid him by granting him a tract of land in the south end of the Kryptgarden Forest, as well as a keep there and money.\nSome time after, the wizard became married to a woman from Red Larch. His wife and their unborn child both died during childbirth.\nTwo years after the death of his wife, the wizards keep was raided by a patrol of the Lostafinga tribe of hobgoblins. They killed his hirelings, and the wizard as well. As he bled out from a fatal arrow wound, his last act was to write a will in ink and his own blood, leaving the keep to a particular niece or nephew of his."
