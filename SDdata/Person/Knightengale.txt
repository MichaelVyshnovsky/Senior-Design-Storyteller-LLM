Knightengale was a human paladin of Cormyr in the mid–14 century DR.
During Gondegals short-lived war of conquest of Cormyr in the , the so-called Lost King slaughtered much of Knightengales order before his downfall and flight from justice. Naming herself his arch-nemesis, she tracked him down—perhaps the only person to do so—and suffered the same fate, as she too was swallowed by the Mists and caught in the Demiplane of Dread.
There, Knightengale continued to hunt Gondegal while he dwelled within the grim domain of Falkovnia.
Knightengale wielded a +5 holy avenger sword and wore +4 full plate armor of blending with a ferroniere of brilliance.
