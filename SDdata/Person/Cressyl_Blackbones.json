        "mainbody": "'''Cressyl Blackbones''' was a male [[orc]] and a [[red dragon|red]] [[half-dragon]] from the [[Thunder Peaks]]. He led a small army of orcs near the eastern edge of the [[Hullack Forest]].{{Cite dungeon/88/The Door from Everywhere|30}}",
        "Description": "Standing 6'10\" (2.08 meters), Cressyl towered over most and with his red skin and ashen scent it made him stand out from the other [[orcs]] in his tribe. This accompanied by his yellow fangs and empty left eye socket compounded his baleful visage.",
        "Possessions": "Cressyl made use of a [[magic]] [[dire flail]] whenever he went into battle and was outfitted in [[magic|enchanted]] half-[[plate mail]] armor. In addition, Cressyl was at all times with his pet [[howler]], [[Spike (howler)|Spike]].",
        "History": "In the summer of [[1372 DR]], members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] inadvertently opened a [[portal]] near where Cressyl Blackbone's orcs were resting. The ensuing combat was quickly finished by the orcs and they learned the secret of opening the portal from one of the cultists. Over the next few days, the orcs slowly explored the portal nexus that the cultists had come from, expanding their raiding until they met more resistance and counterattacks by the cultists."
