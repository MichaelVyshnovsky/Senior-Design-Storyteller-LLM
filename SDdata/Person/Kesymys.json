        "History": "Kesymys was a priest of [[Labelas Enoreth]] in Cormanthor.\n\nIn [[1344 DR]], at the start of the [[Retreat]], Kesymys agreed to remain in [[Faerûn]] to protect the [[Eventide Abbey]] like [[Meira Faerenduil]]. Like her, her oath was so strong that, after the natural end of her life, Kesymys rose as a ghost to continue to protect the ruins of the abbey, but she became trapped in a mural.\n\nShe remained in that state until ''circa'' [[1486 DR]] when she met an adventuring party hired by [[Elanil Elassidil]] trying to bring peace to Meira's spirit. The ghost was curious about the world in this new era."
