He raised [[lacedon]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie|sea zombies]], [[ju-ju zombie]]s, and [[bone shark]]s, who boarded an impressive six pirate vessels and tore both their crews and the ships themselves apart.\n\nThough notorious for the deed, Delthrin gained great respect, fame, and popularity. However, uncomfortable with this attention, he became a recluse by [[1358 DR]]. He devoted himself instead to his continuing necromantic experiments with drowned undead. His dwelling was supposedly guarded by many of his undead creations.\n\nBy [[1369 DR]], one of Delthrin's rumored creations was an aquatic undead like a giant predatory [[shark]]. It was a monstrosity fashioned from the body parts of many different dead creatures, with multiple jawed heads, claws, and a massive set of main jaws."
