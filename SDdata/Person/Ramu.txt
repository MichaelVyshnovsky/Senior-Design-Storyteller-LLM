Ramu was a hunting spider katanga archer, and the best sharpshooter who served the Mother of a Thousand Young within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Like other hunting spider katanga, Ramu possessed a venomous bite and could easily scale any surface. He was a capable escape artist and a dextrous foe. Ramu was considered to be the best archer among spider katanga of the Fire Mountain.
The creature was armed with bone daggers, his enchanted hand-carved mighty shortbow, and bone-tipped arrows.
In the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14 century DR, the Wise Ones tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of evil spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Ramu was stationed within the katangas web room, alongside Taru. The room was draped in thick spiderwebs with desiccated bodies of small animals tangled up in them as well as immature spider katanga and ordinary spider young.
It was unknown if Ramu survived the confrontation with a group of heroes of the Living Jungle when they infiltrated the katanga caves. However, it was possible Ramu escaped death as he preferred to stay out of sight of enemies, shrouded in darkness.
