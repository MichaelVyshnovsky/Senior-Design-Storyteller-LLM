Dreamstone was the only name known of a priestess of Mystryl and a creator of spells from the ancient empire of Netheril.
Dreamstone lived in the days of the ancient Netheril. She enrolled aid from the clerics of the Church of Jannath to help her create several powerful earth-based spells. In gratitude, she created a powerful enchanted item she simply gave her own name â€“ the Dreamstone. The stone was to be used by the Church of Jannath to protect itself from everyone who wished the clergy harm. Dreamstone also created a unique type of spell that allowed two individuals to communicate through imagery and symbolism in their dreams. It was believed that the Dreamstone artifact was imbued with the same type of dream magic. However, the ways of activating it were thought lost or completely speculative. Dreamstones Dreamstone survived into the late 14 century, securing her magical legacy.
