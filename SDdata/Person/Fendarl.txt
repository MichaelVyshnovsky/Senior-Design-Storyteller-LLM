'''Fendarl''' was a former warrior and the founder of the village that bore his name, [[Fendarl's Gate]], in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==History==
Tired of the warrior's life, Fendarl settled here to start a farm, but would have to defend against [[troll]]s for the rest of his life. His descendants would continue to lead the village.

In the 1360s DR, his eccentric descendant [[Eldebuck Thorm Fendarl]] declared himself High Knight-Emperor of the Vale. He boasted of Fendarl's heroism with the same tales each day.
