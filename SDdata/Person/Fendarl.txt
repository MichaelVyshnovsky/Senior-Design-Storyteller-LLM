Fendarl was a former warrior and the founder of the village that bore his name, Fendarls Gate, in the Western Heartlands.
Tired of the warriors life, Fendarl settled here to start a farm, but would have to defend against trolls for the rest of his life. His descendants would continue to lead the village.
In the 1360s DR, his eccentric descendant Eldebuck Thorm Fendarl declared himself High Knight-Emperor of the Vale. He boasted of Fendarls heroism with the same tales each day.
