'''Pip Stonehill''' was a young [[human]] boy who lived in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Pip liked to imagine himself as a hero, and idolized [[adventurer]]s who helped his family and friends. He also enjoyed playing in the fields southeast of Phandalin.

==Relationships==
Pip was the son of [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] and [[Trilena Stonehill]], the owners of the [[Stonehill Inn]], and he had a younger sister named [[Tamara Stonehill|Tamara]]. He was friends with [[Carp Alderleaf]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} Pip's friend, [[Carp Alderleaf|Carp]], told him that he had found a secret tunnel in the woods. The child barely escaped from the [[Redbrands]], who had been terrorizing the town. Pip would sometimes talk to patrons of the Stonehill Inn, and may have informed them about the secretive place his friend had found.

Not long after, Pip went missing while off playing on his own in the fields outside of town. He had spotted three [[encephalon gemmule]]s and, thinking he should keep on eye on the strange monsters, he followed them for {{SI|2|miles|k|long=yes}} until they became trapped in an old ruin known as [[Marthungrim's Home]]. Pip became worried that if he went home and left them there, they might escape and&mdash;at the same time&mdash;he might get in trouble for wandering so far from home. He ended up hunkering down behind a boulder to wait until nightfall to wait for help.

By [[1496 DR]],{{AI-time}} Pip was old enough to help his parents run the family inn.
