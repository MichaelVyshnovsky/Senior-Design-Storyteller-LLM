        "mainbody": "'''Heleen''' was an opportunistic [[tiefling]] delinquent who resided in [[Skullport]], under [[Waterdeep]], ''circa'' 1490s [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''It's nothing personal.''|Heleen}}",
        "Description": "Heleen had sharp fangs, result of her [[lower planes]] tiefling descent., even though her unarmed strikes were just as deadly.",
        "Personality": "Even though Heleen and her buddies had adversarial relationship with the local pirate crew of the ''[[Molly Roger]]'' and were ready too aid someone in trouble, one thing they valued the most was coin, or promise of bounty.",
        "History": "Sometime in 1490s DR, Heleen, along with her shady friends [[Ssslasssh]] and [[Fundunsun]] resided in Skullport and frequented the tavern not far from the docks called the [[Blind Fish]]. The trio encountered the [[halfling]] [[thief]] who was on the quest to retrieve [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s baby [[griffin]] from [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. They fished the halfling out of [[Sargauth]] waters and took him to the Blind Fish to dry off. The thief unwisely asked questions about the [[Xanathar]] which prompted the shady friends to attack the thief. Xanathar offered bounty for anyone who showed curiosity in the crime lord. The little halfling managed to escape the trio with the aid of his wit and dexterity... and the [[orc]] bartender's heavy [[club]]."
