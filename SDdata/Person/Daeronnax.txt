{{quote|Umf… More interlopers? Didn't the string of bodies hung along the entrance make it clear that I don't want visitors? You don't show the slightest bit of respect or common sense.<br/>So typical of your kind! I will end this travesty quickly, for your own sake.|Daeronnax}}

==Description==
Daeronnax was a massive red wyrm who felt nothing but disdain for humanoids and adventurers, using their bodies to decorate the entrance to his lair. He experienced no fear of heroes, only disgust.

==Location==
Daeronnax laired in a volcanic magma-filled cavern beneath the Stonelands, surrounded by his Clan Daeronnax minions. Above his lair was an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient Netherese tomb]] close to the surface, and deeper below in the [[Underdark]] was a [[Drow outpost (Stonelands)|drow outpost]] connected by ''[[portal]]'' to [[Sschindylryn]].

==Possessions==
[[File:Daeronnax treasure pile.jpg|thumb|''Daeronnax's treasure hoard. Look, don't touch.'']]
The great red dragon kept an impressive hoard of treasure in a non-molten corner of his lair, which included many relics stolen from the nearby Netherese tomb. Some of the items found included ''[[heartwood]]'' and ''[[festering mummy wrappings]]''.

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]], a band of [[adventurer]]s made up of [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Helayna]], [[Tristran of Daggerford]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], and [[Liantor Stoneborn]] discovered an ancient tomb at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands. They fought through some [[undead]] and found the deeper tunnels below it, eventually earning the attention of the Clan Daeronnax kobolds who launched an attack that scattered the interlopers. Jarus, Helayna, and Kirina were separated and lost in the caverns, Liantor was caught and killed by the kobolds, and Popkin escaped to the surface to get help. The unlucky Tristran was caught and taken alive, then delivered to Daeronnax who kept him chained up in the treasure pile as a snack for later.

The adventurers that Popkin recruited proved more than able, and they were able to fight their way through the Netherese tomb and into the Clan Daeronnax tunnels, rescuing her companions as they went. They finally found the lair where Tristran was kept, and overcame the threat of the massive red dragon to rescue him. The remaining kobolds were heartbroken and terrified, and Daeronnax's hoard was rummaged through before the dragon-slayers departed, possibly with one of his ''[[empowered dragonscale]]s''.
