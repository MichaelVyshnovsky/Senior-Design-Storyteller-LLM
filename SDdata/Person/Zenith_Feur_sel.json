His journey was ultimately cut short however in in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. He was killed by a group of raiders aligned with the [[cult of the Absolute|cultist of the Absolute]]. Zenith was among the dozen individuals chosen by the entity [[Withers]] to aid in his campaign against the [[Dead Three]]. It may be implied that Zenith was the son of another elven Greycloak of Evereska, [[Xan]], having his father noted as being a dour mannered man who (rightfully) claimed that Zenith was 'doomed'."
