==Description==
Bustlebury was a [[hin]] man with bronze skin, dark brown eyes, and short red hair. The halfling wore good quality clothes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, the gates between the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] were closed, monitored by the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries and allowing only the wealthy and current residents of the Upper City through. Bustlebury was among the Baldurians who sought passage to the Upper City, suffering through the long lines and rude Fists.
