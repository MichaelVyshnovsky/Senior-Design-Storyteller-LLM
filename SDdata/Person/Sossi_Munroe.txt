'''Sossi "Munroe"''' was a [[kobold]] ne'er-do-well, who along with the rest of the Munroe family harassed inhabitants of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Sossi appeared to be an average [[kobold]] who did not look particularly intelligent.

==Possessions==
Sossi was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[warhammer]].

==History==
In 1372 DR, Sossi "Munroe," along with his "family members," [[Jethro Munroe]], [[Yage Munroe]], [[Methro Munroe]], and [[Fang (dog)|Fang]], camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liam's Hold along the [[Trade Way]]. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor [[Wilsey]] listed the help of the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the [[Wild Pastures]] and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero a stronghold - a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of [[Bhaal]], in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed.
