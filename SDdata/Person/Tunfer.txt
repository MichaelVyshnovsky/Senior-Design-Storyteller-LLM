Tunfer the Stout was a male human cleric who resided in Dagger Falls and advised Lord Randal Morn.
As an experienced cleric, Tunfer could pray for spells capable of raising the dead, if needed. 
Besides his duties as a priest of Tyr at the Temple of Tyr in Dagger Falls, Tunfer would also counsel Lord Randal Morn. During the occupation of Daggerdale by the Zhents, Tunfer displayed talent with the healing arts and would regularly tend to wounded soldiers.
By 1368 DR, Tunfer the Stout was a firm ally of Randal Morn and worked as a trusted advisor to the Lord. The priest of Tyr would help the wounded freedom fighters of Daggerdale that still fought against the dales Zhent rulership.
After Randal Morn had reclaimed Dagger Falls and assumed his place as its ruler once again, Tunfer the Stout eventually became a resident of the town. In 1372 DR, Tunfer was arguably the most experienced cleric in Dagger Falls and was still one of Randal Morns closest counselors.
