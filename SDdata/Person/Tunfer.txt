'''Tunfer the Stout''' was a male [[human]] [[cleric]] who resided in [[Dagger Falls]] and advised Lord [[Randal Morn]].

==Abilities==
As an experienced [[cleric]], Tunfer could pray for [[spell]]s capable of [[raise dead|raising the dead]], if needed. 

==Activities==
Besides his duties as a [[priest]] of [[Tyr]] at the [[Temple of Tyr (Dagger Falls)|Temple of Tyr]] in [[Dagger Falls]], Tunfer would also counsel Lord [[Randal Morn]]. During the occupation of Daggerdale by the [[Zhent]]s, Tunfer displayed talent with the healing arts and would regularly tend to wounded soldiers.

==History==
By [[1368 DR]], Tunfer the Stout was a firm ally of Randal Morn and worked as a trusted advisor to the Lord. The priest of Tyr would help the wounded freedom fighters of [[Daggerdale]] that still fought against the dale's Zhent [[Tren Noemfor|rulership]].

After Randal Morn had reclaimed Dagger Falls and assumed his place as its ruler once again, Tunfer the Stout eventually became a resident of the town. In [[1372 DR]], Tunfer was arguably the most experienced [[cleric]] in Dagger Falls and was still one of Randal Morn's closest counselors.
