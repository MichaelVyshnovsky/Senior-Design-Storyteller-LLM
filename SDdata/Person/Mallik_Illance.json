        "mainbody": "Captain Mallik Illance was a shipowner and nobleman of the Illance family of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR. He was based at the Cormyrean Embassy in Calimport around 1370 DR.\nHe was seventh in line for the clans lordship and an elder cousin of Jhartos Illance, who was third in line.\nMallik was one of the clans few ship owners. Owing to this fact and his responsility to the family, he was forced to bring Jhartos to the Cormyrean Embassy, but hated the city and remained only because it was his duty. He established trade ties with honest merchants whose goods could be sold in Cormyr."
