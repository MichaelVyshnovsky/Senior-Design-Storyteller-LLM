Asgerlan Burtrann was an author that resided in Cormyr at some point before the 1370s DR. He was killed for publishing his controversial work Cormyrian Customs And Scandals.
Asgerlan described his work as "a brief and tasteful inquiry into interesting social pastimes and their effects." but members of the Cormyrian nobility judged the work to be treasonous in its revelations. Throrton Marliir had Asgerlan put to death by being dragged behind a horse.
