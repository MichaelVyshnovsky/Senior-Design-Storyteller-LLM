        "mainbody": "Gugak Thul was the hobgoblin chief of a small tribe around 1369 DR, who was subservient to the fire giant Oghalis as they operated in the Hullack Forest.\nGugak was rather upset and short-tempered about the state of his tribe and its new direction under Oghalis.\nGugak wielded a +2 longsword and a spear, and carried a potion of healing. He had a significant stash of gems and coins.\nUnder Oghalis direction, he managed much of the tribes internal matters and oversaw the production of copper and lumber at their work camp.\nHe wasnt particularly fond of Oghalis, but was willing to work for her if it meant benefiting his tribe. He sought spiritual advice and wisdom from his shaman Hakaakatar the Wise.\nIn the , Gugaks tribe suffered many losses as they attempted to live in the Hullack Forest. Hoping to improve their fortunes, he accepted the leadership of the fire giant Oghalis, who had the tribe turn to aggressive woodcutting and exploratory copper mining. To expedite this, they began enslaving the local satyrs and centaurs, but they proved unsuitable for copper smelting. The tribe then began kidnapping humans from the nearby town of Thunderstone, forcing their satyrs to abduct Troyappa, Kenhart, Joelem, and Jonren. This finally drew the attention of Cormyrean adventurers, who raided the camp and freed the slaves."
