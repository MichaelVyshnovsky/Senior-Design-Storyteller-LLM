Sheila, or the Thief, was a rogue and an adventurer from Earth and the Realm (no relation). She was a companion of the monk Diana, the fighter Eric, the wizard Presto, the ranger Hank, and her younger brother the barbarian Bobby.
Sheila was very friendly, open, and sensitive, and she cared deeply about her friends and especially her younger brother, to whom she tried to be a good role model. She feared losing them and also being alone, which her so friendly to others. However, this manner also made her appear gullible, and got her into trouble. She feared to speak up in public. However, she was a capable leader of the group.
An adept rogue, she dual-wielded her rapiers. She was quite intelligent.
Most notably, Sheila wore a cloak of invisibility, which naturally enough turned her invisible.
Sheila and her friends were originally from Earth, They were later in some place they called "the Forgotten Realms", evidently not knowing the difference. Aiding by a mysterious entity known as the Dungeon Master, they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous Venger and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home.
Living long before the mid-to-late 14 century DR, she was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat, together with their miniature unicorn. By 1369 DR, the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla, Amn, displayed paintings of her two friends, Hank and Bobby.
In the 1360s DR, Sheila and her friends visited the town of Shadowdale in Faer√ªn so that Presto could ask the great sage Elminster to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the Old Skull Inn, they spotted Elminster, but Presto lost his nerve and Sheila encouraged him to at least ask. She stood beside him to declare his suitability to Elminster.
Thus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.
In her adult years, the rogue still looked somewhat similar. Sheila had ginger hair of similar length and style to that which she had as a child. She wore a red robe.
In the late 1490s DR, Sheila and her friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the High Sun Games in the newly built arena in Neverwinter. They evaded the displacer beast and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina used the horn of beckoning death above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The beckoning death smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.
Aged only 13, Sheila and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried potatoes they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth he had a new plan, but Sheila and the others were tired and were accepting their new life and she debated with Hank over it. But then driders and darkmantles ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious portal that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of Waterdeep, now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.
