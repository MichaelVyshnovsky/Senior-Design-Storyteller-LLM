Krivvin Shamblestar was the tavernmaster of the Stag-Horned Flagon in Amphail circa the .
In the , he had lived through 67 winters, had silver hair and beard, and was still sturdily built from his days as a fighter. He was of Illuskan descent, generally spoke softly, and had an economy of movement.
Along with being an exceptional knife-thrower, Krivvin had an extensive memory for faces and knew the favorite drinks of his clientele. He also had excellent hearing and made sure that he knew most of the business that went on inside his tavern, whether the patrons realized it or not.
He was a friend of the Harpers and had contact with the Lords of Waterdeep through Mirt the Moneylender, both of whom consulted him for news and views on local situations.
By 1370 DR, Krivvin had trained the six serving girls that worked in his tavern to be expert knife-throwers.
Mirt was an old friend of Krivvins and visited the tavern regularly.
