        "mainbody": "'''Durm Goroy''' was a convicted criminal from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Durm Goroy was accused of an assassination attempt on Lord [[Enver Gortash]] during [[The Absolute]] Crisis. Whether this was truth or a political setup, Durm was arrested, tried, and condemned to public execution. As the Absolutist army marched on Baldur's Gate and unbeknownst to all, Lord Gortash being one of the Absolute's leaders, Durm, alongside a fellow prisoner named [[Vince Torell]], was to be transferred from the [[Stonyeyes Precinct]] of the [[Flaming Fist]] to the [[Basilisk Gate]] prison on the orders from Manip [[Farthingale]]. Basilisk Gate had a handy plaza with a hanging stage set up for public executions at the time."
