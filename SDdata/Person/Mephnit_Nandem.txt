'''Mephnit Nandem''' was a bookstore owner and book collector{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|139}} in [[Skuld]] in [[Mulhorand]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The man would've been tall if he weren't stooped with age, but he had black hair and dark skin.

==Abilities==
Mephnit claimed to have wards in his home, capable of summoning the Guard.

==Possessions==
Besides the book store he owned, Mephnit carried a [[wand]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1372}}, Mephnit Nandem was the owner of a bookstore. One night, he discovered [[Saura Umakra]], a [[Red Wizard]] who had broken into his store and stolen ''[[The Scalamagdrion]]'' from his collection. She attempted to buy the book from him, but as he didn't respond quickly enough, and threatened that the Guard may have been called, she slew him with a knife.

==Personality==
Though the man ultimately didn't deal with Saura Umakra, he hesitated to attack her and was visibly tempted by the money.
