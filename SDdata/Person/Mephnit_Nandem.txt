Mephnit Nandem was a bookstore owner and book collector in Skuld in Mulhorand in the late 14 century DR.
The man wouldve been tall if he werent stooped with age, but he had black hair and dark skin.
Mephnit claimed to have wards in his home, capable of summoning the Guard.
Besides the book store he owned, Mephnit carried a wand.
In , Mephnit Nandem was the owner of a bookstore. One night, he discovered Saura Umakra, a Red Wizard who had broken into his store and stolen The Scalamagdrion from his collection. She attempted to buy the book from him, but as he didnt respond quickly enough, and threatened that the Guard may have been called, she slew him with a knife.
Though the man ultimately didnt deal with Saura Umakra, he hesitated to attack her and was visibly tempted by the money.
