        "mainbody": "'''Gullwyn''' was a sailing merchant-[[mage]] who lived centuries before the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Gullwyn was the creator of the famous blade called the ''[[Dagger of Safe Harbor]]'', an [[enchanted]] blade that protected its wielder from all harm. In his long sailor's career Gullwyn witnessed countless men being swept off the ships during deadly storms all because of a split second of fear. In the years that followed the weapon's creation, the ''Dagger of Safe Harbor'' saved Gullwyn's life on at least three occasions. At the end of his career, Gullwyn entrusted the famed dagger to his friend â€“ [[Valkur]] of [[Mintarn]]."
