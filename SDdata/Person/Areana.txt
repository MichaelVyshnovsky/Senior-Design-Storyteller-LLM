'''Areana''' was a noblewoman who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was an acquaintance of the mercenary [[Tor Lobo]].

==History==
Some time in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Areana had an affair in the [[Undercellar]] beneath Baldur's Gate. A man by the name of [[Cyrdemac]] became aware of the tryst and started blackmailing Areana in order to keep his silence.

Areana in turn sought out individuals to kill Cyrdemac, offering a sum of 2,000 [[gp|gold pieces]].
