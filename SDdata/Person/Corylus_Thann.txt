'''Corylus Thann''' ({{Pronounce|KOR|eh|luss|refs=}}) was a noble of the [[Thann|Thann family]] and a [[Lord of Waterdeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
 
==Personality==
Corylus lacked the moral values typical of the Thann family. He was also a racist, focusing on the welfare of [[human]] citizens only. He refused to be in debt to anyone and was suspicious of people who tried to curry favor with him.

==Activities==
Corylus was one of the most prominent vintners of [[Waterdeep]]. He however preferred focusing on his duties as Lord while other family members managed the family wine business. Corylus usually traveled through the city by coach with six guards as protection. He could also call on eight members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] at his disposal as reinforcements. 

==History==
In the past, Corylus hired some [[Zhentarim]] thugs to harm some non-humans that sought positions of political power in the city.

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} [[Manshoon]] blackmailed Corylus and forced him to use his political power to cover the activities of the Zhentarim loyal to Manshoon.
