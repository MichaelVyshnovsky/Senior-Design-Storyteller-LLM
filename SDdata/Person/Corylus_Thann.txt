Corylus Thann () was a noble of the Thann family and a Lord of Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR.
Corylus lacked the moral values typical of the Thann family. He was also a racist, focusing on the welfare of human citizens only. He refused to be in debt to anyone and was suspicious of people who tried to curry favor with him.
Corylus was one of the most prominent vintners of Waterdeep. He however preferred focusing on his duties as Lord while other family members managed the family wine business. Corylus usually traveled through the city by coach with six guards as protection. He could also call on eight members of the City Watch at his disposal as reinforcements. 
In the past, Corylus hired some Zhentarim thugs to harm some non-humans that sought positions of political power in the city.
In 1492 DR, Manshoon blackmailed Corylus and forced him to use his political power to cover the activities of the Zhentarim loyal to Manshoon.
