'''Overlord Flamespar''' was the leader of the [[firenewt]] raiders who took over the [[Mines of Selgol]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Flamespar was a [[humanoid]] bipedal lizard with large black eyes, a tail, and claws. He was a significantly larger specimen than his kin.

==Possessions==
Overlord wore an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[chainmail]] and was armed with a ''[[greataxe of flame]]''. The creature also wore a ''[[Snaketongue amulet]]'', indicating it as a member of the [[Zehir]]-worshiping [[Snaketongue cult]] ran by the [[House Se'Sehen]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the [[salt]] Mines of Selgol were attacked by a tribe of firenewts led by the massive lizard Overlord Flamespar. The creatures and their pet [[hell hound]]s rose from the deeper underground and poured into the mining tunnels. The creatures dragged workers away and took the mines as the surviving workers fled. [[Torich]]'s militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. [[Essien]], one of the mine's foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation after meeting the man drinking his sorrows away at [[The Broken Pick]] in [[Torich]].
