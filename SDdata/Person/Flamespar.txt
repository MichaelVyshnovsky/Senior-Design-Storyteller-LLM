Overlord Flamespar was the leader of the firenewt raiders who took over the Mines of Selgol in the late 14 century DR.
Flamespar was a humanoid bipedal lizard with large black eyes, a tail, and claws. He was a significantly larger specimen than his kin.
Overlord wore an enchanted +1 chainmail and was armed with a greataxe of flame. The creature also wore a Snaketongue amulet, indicating it as a member of the Zehir-worshiping Snaketongue cult ran by the House SeSehen.
In the , the salt Mines of Selgol were attacked by a tribe of firenewts led by the massive lizard Overlord Flamespar. The creatures and their pet hell hounds rose from the deeper underground and poured into the mining tunnels. The creatures dragged workers away and took the mines as the surviving workers fled. Torichs militia was informed of the attack but failed to act in a timely manner. Essien, one of the mines foremen, was desperate for help against the fiery monsters. Some said that a group of adventurers who worked with merchant SaSani of Samargol volunteered to help with the situation and eradicate the infestation after meeting the man drinking his sorrows away at The Broken Pick in Torich.
