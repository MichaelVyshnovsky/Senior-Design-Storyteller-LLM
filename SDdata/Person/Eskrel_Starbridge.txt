'''Eskrel Starbridge''' was a [[Highknight]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Appearance==
He was stern-looking.

==Relationships==
During the Tethgard raid, Eskrel Starbridge was part of the same squad as [[Merlar]] and [[Therlon]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|332-334|32}}

As head of the Highknights, his Clerk of Vigilance was [[Talonar Winter]].

==Possessions==
He carried a ''[[teleport ring]]'' that belonged to [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]], until he yielded it unto [[Storm Silverhand]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|337-340|32}}

==Activities==
He was a veteran [[Highkight]] by {{yearlink|1479}}, when he became the Head Highknight. Per Storm Silverhand, he was one of the few that could be trusted to do much of anything.

==History==
Eskrel Starbridge had been part of the raid on [[Tethgard]] in [[Mirtul 5]] of {{yearlink|1479}} against the fugitive wizard [[Elminster Aumar]]. During the raid, [[Storm Silverhand]], an accomplice of Elminster's, snuck up on him and knocked him unconscious with [[longsleep herb]] before the confrontation.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|41|3}}

After the raid, Eskrel became the new head of all highknights. Acting on information from [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]], he decided to go seek out Elminster in [[Shadowdale]], personally.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|273, 275-278|26}} He came across a [[doppelganger]] pretending to be him,{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|335-336|32}} whom they initially mistook for the Old Mage, until they saw her bare chest as she introduced herself as the Marchioness of [[Immerdusk]]. She convinced him to yield up his ''teleport ring''.

He was unable to return in time for the [[Council of the Dragon]]. Later, Talonar Winter and him were the ones who reported the death of everyone in [[Staghaven House]] to Glathra, including [[Rorstil Hallowdant]], who wasn't supposed to be there.

Eskrel was among the retinue protecting King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] during the [[Festival of Handras]], when the Wizards of War became aware of a plot to draw out the [[blueflame ghost]]s and anticipated a dangerous situation for the King. Foril insisted in a different tactic, where the ghosts would be lured out of the palace; they succeeded on that.
