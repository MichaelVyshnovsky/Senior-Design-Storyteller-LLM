Eskrel Starbridge was a Highknight of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was stern-looking.
During the Tethgard raid, Eskrel Starbridge was part of the same squad as Merlar and Therlon.
As head of the Highknights, his Clerk of Vigilance was Talonar Winter.
He carried a teleport ring that belonged to Filfaeril Obarskyr, until he yielded it unto Storm Silverhand.
He was a veteran Highkight by , when he became the Head Highknight. Per Storm Silverhand, he was one of the few that could be trusted to do much of anything.
Eskrel Starbridge had been part of the raid on Tethgard in Mirtul 5 of  against the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar. During the raid, Storm Silverhand, an accomplice of Elminsters, snuck up on him and knocked him unconscious with longsleep herb before the confrontation.
After the raid, Eskrel became the new head of all highknights. Acting on information from Rorskryn Mreldrake, he decided to go seek out Elminster in Shadowdale, personally. He came across a doppelganger pretending to be him, whom they initially mistook for the Old Mage, until they saw her bare chest as she introduced herself as the Marchioness of Immerdusk. She convinced him to yield up his teleport ring.
He was unable to return in time for the Council of the Dragon. Later, Talonar Winter and him were the ones who reported the death of everyone in Staghaven House to Glathra, including Rorstil Hallowdant, who wasnt supposed to be there.
Eskrel was among the retinue protecting King Foril Obarskyr I during the Festival of Handras, when the Wizards of War became aware of a plot to draw out the blueflame ghosts and anticipated a dangerous situation for the King. Foril insisted in a different tactic, where the ghosts would be lured out of the palace they succeeded on that.
