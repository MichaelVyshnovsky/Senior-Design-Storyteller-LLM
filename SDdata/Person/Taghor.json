        "Possessions": "The fighter donned [[chainmail]] and a dwarven [[helmet]], and fought with an [[axe]].",
        "History": "Taghor was a warrior of King [[Teirgoh]], and fought with him against the dark elves beneath [[Waterdeep]]. Whilst trying to stop the drow from assaulting the royal family, he almost met his death at the blade of a drow. He may have later been healed by the party setting out to slay [[Xanathar]], and if so, he informed them that his king was grievously wounded, and Prince [[Keirgar]] had been kidnapped. He thanked the adventurers for saving him from death, but could not offer them a reward, as he had become separated from his clan during the battle. The fighter offered to join the adventurers, and told them whereabouts his clan had settled on the lower level."
