Jenila was a noble marid who inhabited Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Jenila spent a good deal of time within the White Agates Tower, associating with the White Agate and helping him guard his possessions.
She enjoyed spending time with the White Agate because she believed him to be one of the few humans who approached her level of intelligence. They were close friends because of this.
It was widely rumored among the students of the tower that the White Agate and Jenila were lovers.
