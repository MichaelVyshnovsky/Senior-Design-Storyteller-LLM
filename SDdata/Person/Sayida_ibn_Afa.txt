Sayida ibn Afa was a rawun who lived within the fortress of Sarahin in 1367 DR.
Contrary to those with whom she lived, Sayida despised killing.
Sayida was well-connected within Sarahin, serving as confidant to both the Shadow Caliph and the leader of the Loyalists, Yusuf bin Ayyub.
She remained confident that Yusuf would appoint her as leader of the Loyalists upon Marwans death.
Sayida was the niece of the Shadow Caliph.
Sayida owned a dagger of quickness and a qanun of quiet.
