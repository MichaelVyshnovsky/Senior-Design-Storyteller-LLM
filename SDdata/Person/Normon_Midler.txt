Normon Midler was a young member of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.
Normon was a young man with brown hair, and wore a brown tunic.
Normon was the first son of Ricnan and Jandove, and older brother of Thoben.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the cook Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.
Normon was held captive in the kitchen of the house, alongside his father Ricnan and aunt Quilynn, guarded by several drow invaders who kept them magically paralysed.
