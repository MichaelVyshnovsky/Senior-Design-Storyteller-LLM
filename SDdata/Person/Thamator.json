        "History": "In {{yearlink|767}}, Thamator the Old was already a Harper and on his fifth decade of life. On that year, or not long before it, he had lost some family to the evil wizard [[Gulthund]], including his younger brother, [[Rarleniir]] the Raven, Rarleniir's wife, the sorceress [[Selûneshar]], and their two daughters. A disguised [[Mystra]] brought two of her children to him, disguising them as his kin; so, Thamator became the foster father to two of the [[Seven Sisters]], Alustriel and Sylune, after the death of their birth mother, [[Elué Shundar]], and their abandonment by [[Dornal Silverhand]]. Sylune was later educated by [[Hauliyr]], another Harper, while Alustriel remained under his care.\n\nHe hired the mage [[Thurduil]] to educate her, and later on, [[Gaerd]]. On {{yearlink|778}},{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}} with their relationship tightly strained by Alustriel's lack of progress in the art, Thamator refused Alustriel entry in the Harpers, and then allowed Lord [[Irlar]] to court her. On the night of [[Uktar 12]] of that year, he found that Alustriel had slain Lord Irlar by throwing him off a window; he was disturbed, but still quite pleased by that."
