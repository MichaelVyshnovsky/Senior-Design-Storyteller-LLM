Algorind was a paladin of the Knights of Samular in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Algorind was a man whod lost his way. His unquestioning willingness to follow superiors orders had led him far from Tyrs path, although he remained a sincere, earnest, and dedicated man. Full of confusion, he asked for advice from Gareth Cormaeril, who was secretly the man responsible for Algorinds troubles. Thus he followed without question the orders of his tormentor.
Algorind, starting out as a very zealous paladin, was for years deceived by Gareth into trying to fulfill many futile quests. Becoming Gareths pawn, he had orders to avoid Bronwyn Caradoon, who had worked for the opposing faction in the Thornhold affair.
