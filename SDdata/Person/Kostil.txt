'''Kostil''' was an elder [[malaugrym]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
In 1358 DR, regarding the hunt for [[Elminster Aumar]], Kostil joked to the younger malaugrym, provoking them to attack the human wizard without preparation. The young [[Taernil]] accepted Kostil's challenge.

Kostil later suggested they kidnap Elminster, instead of killing him, and take him to the [[Castle of Shadows]]. However, [[Dlagim]] reminded Kostil that last time El had gone to the Castle of Shadows he slew forty malaugrym and only Dlagim and two others survived.
