Kostil was an elder malaugrym in 1358 DR.
In 1358 DR, regarding the hunt for Elminster Aumar, Kostil joked to the younger malaugrym, provoking them to attack the human wizard without preparation. The young Taernil accepted Kostils challenge.
Kostil later suggested they kidnap Elminster, instead of killing him, and take him to the Castle of Shadows. However, Dlagim reminded Kostil that last time El had gone to the Castle of Shadows he slew forty malaugrym and only Dlagim and two others survived.
