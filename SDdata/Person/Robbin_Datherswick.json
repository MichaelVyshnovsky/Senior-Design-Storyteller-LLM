        "Description": "Robbin was a [[strongheart halfling]] with a light skin tone, blonde hair, and dark brown eyes.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Robbin Datherswick could often be seen visiting [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. The halfling was an aspiring competitor of the [[fireworks]] seller, who considered [[Avery Sonshal]] to be a genius salesman. Robbin concluded that it was an ingenious business decision to be the only licensed fireworks vendor in the entire city. The halfling was inspired to find something unique that only he could produce, and that was hard to replicate, in order to establish his own monopoly."
