'''Arderiel''' was a Champion of [[Sune]] from the town of [[Skull Crag]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Arderiel was a polite male [[half-elf]] with pale skin and long blonde hair. He was a devoted follower of his goddess, a talented [[fighter]], and a capable [[mage]].

==Possessions==
The half-elf champion was armed with a [[long sword]] and a [[composite longbow]]. He was protected by an [[elfin chain]] and a [[helmet]].

==Relationships==
Arderiel was a trusted companion of [[Kallithrea Starbrow]], a daughter of the [[Roadwarden]] [[Arelin Starbrow]].

==History==
In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], when Arderiel was 27 winters old, Arelin Starbrow perished in a treacherous monster ambush on the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]]. Her set of [[enchanted]] arms â€“ the symbol of the office, were lost to the monsters. Subsequently, Kallithrea Starbrow was tasked by her father in the recovery of the ''[[Shield]] of the Roadwarden'' in her stead, Kallithrea sent Arderiel, who was to join a group of caravan guards in the arms' recovery.

The search of the ''Shield of the Roadwarden'' led the group to an [[ogre]] cave village in the [[Storm Horns]]. Arderiel witnessed image of Arelin Starbrow in a crystal ball, alive and well, and he immediately rushed to what he thought was the Roadwarden. The woman he found looked like the hero but in reality was just a trick of the mastermind behind the ogre and ogre magi alliance, a [[fiend]]ish [[rakshasa]] who claimed the ''Shield of the Roadwarden''. A second rakshasa joined the fray, but both were slain by the adventurers who claimed the enchanted item and returned it to Kallithrea Starbrow.
