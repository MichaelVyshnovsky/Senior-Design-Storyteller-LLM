'''Light of Heavens''' was an [[aasimar]] [[divine champion]] of [[Lathander]] of the [[Sword Coast North]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
She was the twin sister of [[Joy]].

==Description==
She was tall and beautiful, with the scars of battle. She carried herself with confidence.

==History==
When she was born, the priests that delivered her exclaimed "light of heavens" (for reasons not revealed), and they decided to name her that. Her twin sister was named Joy.

Both sisters were raised by priests of Lathander and were determined to bring happiness and light to [[Faerûn]]. However, their methods of doing so were radically different: Joy decided that dancing was the best way to bring happiness to people, and became a traveling minstrel, while Light of Heavens, believing that fighting evil wherever it could be found was the best way, swore an oath to serve as a Knight of Lathander.

During the evacuation of [[Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Light of Heavens encountered the [[Kalach-Cha]] and party in the [[Neverwinter/Protector's Enclave|Merchant's District]], where she tried to get a feel for the now-Knight-Captain of [[Crossroad Keep]]. She challenged the Kalach-Cha to a duel to test their resolve in the fight against the shadows. When the Kalach-Cha beat her, she left, but not before saying she would challenge them two more times.

The Kalach-Cha and companions next encountered Light of Heavens at [[Port Llast]], where she revealed how she got the name "Light of Heavens". She then challenged the Kalach-Cha again, this time using a larger portion of her strength. Again, the Kalach-Cha defeated her.

Light of Heavens then made her way to Crossroad Keep. There she challenged the Kalach-Cha again, this time at full strength; again, the hero bested her. Impressed, Light of Heavens offered her services as a sergeant in the [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter]]. Evidently she left the Graycloaks following the [[King of Shadows]]' defeat.{{Speculation}}

Later that year, Light of Heavens would be encountered by another hero whilst traveling, and offer to spar with them.<ref>{{cite game/Storm of Zehir}}
