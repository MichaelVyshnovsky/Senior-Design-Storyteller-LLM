Vosh the White was a miller in the village of Toralth in Tethyr in 1370 DR.
Very few in Toralth knew that Vosh was a half-orc, thanks to his long beard. The only orcish traits he inherited were a pug nose and features that he could hide underneath a thick beard.
He often went to the Blue Badger Inn, being an old friend of the owner Jorid.
On Uktar 10, 1370 DR, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the Blue Badger Inn, seeking the Sondarr Scepter. When Bramas Thorntree accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Vosh was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers.
