'''Mhai Prittee''', or '''Mhai the Mage''', was an adventuring mage who gained the favor of a Hillsfaran noblewoman in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], that jumpstarted his heroic career.

{{quote|''I'll help you. Come on, do you really enjoy sleeping on [[horse]]-[[manure]] pillows every night?''|[[Dodo (familiar)|Dodo]] to Mhai{{Cite document/Hillsfar/Clue Book|23-24}}}}

==Description==
Like many other mages, Mhai wore wizard's [[robe]]s.

==Personality==
Mhai hated [[rat]]s and gladly used them for his [[spell]] target practice.

==Possessions==
At some pint before the events of [[1358 DR]], Mhai acquired several ''[[knock ring]]s'' during an adventure.

==Relationships==
Mhai's trusted [[familiar]] was the [[frog]] named [[Dodo (familiar)|Dodo]]. The eloquent amphibian was one year old, or seventy in frog years. Dodo verbosely communicated with Mhai via ''[[telepathy]]''.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, young Mhai the Mage spent his entire life within the city walls of Hillsfar. Without ever venturing outside, Mhai often dreamt of what he thought the farm life outside was like: [[dwarf|dwarven]] maidens with parted beards, churning [[milk]] into [[butter]] with their hairy feet amidst a pastoral countryside setting. One night, such great changed into a strange vision of two feminine arms luring him towards a woman's face for a kiss and then towards a magic shop Mhai recognized as the establishment always holding a "Going Out of Business Sale."

Mhai discussed the vision with his aged wide frog familiar. Obviously, the vision commanded the mage to break into the magic shop under a cover for the night. They theorized that there was something important in the show, or maybe the vision was a command from the [[Hillsfar Mages' Guild|Mages' Guild]] of Hillsfar, of which Mhai was a member of. The young mage thought it to be his big break, an opportunity to abandon his life of sleeping in Hillsfar's stables. Despite his history of being captured by the [[Red Plumes]] while trespassing in the past and being sent to the [[Hillsfar Arena]] and receiving a whooping from [[Lefty]] the [[orc]], Mhai decided to risk it.

Mhai entered the shop via one of his ''knock rings'' and quickly began to search for whatever the "Arm and Lip Lady" from his vision wanted. Eventually, Mhai discovered an item he'd never seen before – a faintly-glowing [[pick]], carved with ornate designs and inscribed with its name – ''[[Stonemaster]]''. Still unclear on the vision's purpose, the mage and his familiar decided that the pick needed to be returned to its master, as it was obviously out of place in a wizard's miscellany store. Mhai thought that it belonged to the master of a rock quarry west of Hillsfar.

The young mage was terrified of the wilderness outside of town – all the [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[bear]]s. On his way across the town back to the stables, Mhai was confronted by [[Wak Rathar]], who appeared out of nowhere on the [[Market Street (Hillsfar)|Market Street]]. The old wizard offered to show the youth a magic trick, but Mhai declined as he once before fell for the man's trick and ended up fighting Lefty in the Arena. As the sun began to rise, Mhai tracked down the stable master – [[Darnin]], and convinced him to land the youth a horse for the journey to the quarry west of Hillsfar, past a roadside trading post. Mhai decided to stop at the trading post along the way to gather information. There, he purchased a map of the quarry that managed to only show its approximate location, past the hermit's place.

Mhai did stop at the hermit's hut, but to his annoyance, the old man took a vow of silence and offered no help apart from his maniacal humming. The mage and his familiar proceeded to move through the woods for the next hour and finally reached the quarry, swarming with dwarven and [[human]] miners. The quarry master was an extremely irate dwarf who, indeed, was the owner of the ''Stonemaster''. A woman named [[Diane]] promised the dwarf that someone would be bringing the pick soon and left an elixir to give to the young mage as a reward. Mhai decided to show the mysterious bottle to the guildmaster of the Hillsfar Mages' Guild.

By dusk of the same day, Mhai was back in Hillsfar and at the stables.{{Cite document/Hillsfar/Clue Book|25-26}}

[[Tanna's Archery Range]] was the next stop on Mhai's strange journey. The range offered those not proficient with ranged weapons, like Mhai, magic [[wand]]s to shoot the targets with. After a long session of hitting targets and scoring well across four scoreboards, Mhai's task was completed. [[Tanna]] handed the mage his winnings and, in secrecy, told him that Diane was sending him on the next part of the quest – to the [[Wizard's Labyrinth]] outside of Hillsfar, where more ''elixirs of Diane'' were hidden. The journey continued on the back of another of Damin's horses.

Using another one of his ''knock rings'', Mhai gained entrance to the Wizard's Labyrinth. After several hours of searching about the hallways and headends, the mage found a vial of the reddish potion, another vial of the ''elixir of Diane''. Another potion was uncorked, and red mist showed the daughter of Dianne once again, and once again, she left Mhai with a puzzle: "The second honor is one of freeing the [[Mages' Tower]] from a malevolent spirit. You need to open a special chest within the room it inhabits."

Mhai was set to finish the quest, even if it meant angering a malevolent spirit; the reward was a position in the guild. The Mages' Tower was an abandoned structure in Hillsfar. Inside, Mhai was assaulted with the feeling of palpable evil. Soon after entering, the mage began the search for the chest, pursued by the spirit. At the very moment, Mhai opened the chest, he was grasped by the spirit was ready for his cold grave, but in a blast of brilliant light, a goodly spirit rose from the chest and repelled the young mage's doom. It uttered, "You are honored this day with the second honor of Diane," and disappeared, leaving an ''elixir of Diane'' behind. The last and final message for the young mage was, "The last honor, my daring mage, is one of defeating the proud [[minotaur]], [[Taurus]], in the Arena. He is the instigator of my imprisonment."

The next day Mhai rose full of determination to finish his strange quest and defeat the bovine [[gladiator]] of the Hillsfar Arena.{{Cite document/Hillsfar/Clue Book|27}}

Finding the ''mirror'' was an easy task; Mahi found it in the first chest he came across. With the ''mirror of life trapping'' smashed, Diane's daughter was freed at last. His reward was a hug from a beautiful young woman whose name he never learned. Lady Diane did leave a kind word with the Mages' Guild. Glinda, the Master of Mages, thanked the wizard youth and awarded him a sack of 21,500 [[gold]] [[pieces]] from Lady Diane. The reward from Glinda was magic from the ''[[ring of wishes]]'' that made Mhai sturdier, stronger, and able to withstand more damage.

The strange adventure ended with Mhai using the earnings to purchase one of Damin's horses, Magesteed, and galloping away to [[Tilverton]].
