Asref was a saint of the Church of Ilmater established in the 14 century DR, though by 1370 DR they had yet to be officially sanctioned by the Church. They were considered by the Nadhari &mdash an organization dedicated to freeing slaves in Calimshan &mdash to be their patron saint.
Around 1370 DR, a personal shrine and mission dedicated to Asref were established in the Hook Ward of Calimport by the Tethyrian priest Brother Dolmas.
