Silpara Tesper was a wizard and noblewoman of the Waterdhavian noble house Tesper.
She lived within Tespergates located at the corner of Mendever Street and Delzorin Street in the central section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward.
Silpara was slain by assassins sent by a younger brother who believed she would use her skills with magic to claim power within the family. Her ghost remained within Tespergates, quietly haunting the family villa.
Silpara once appeared directly next to a Harper named Nleera who was impersonating her ghost during a party at Tespergates, foiling the Harpers disguise and leading to her discovery by Armult Tesper who later married the Harper.
Silparas sister was Yulhymbra.
