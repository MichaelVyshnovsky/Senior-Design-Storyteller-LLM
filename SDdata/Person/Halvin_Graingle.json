His mission was to make a new bargain with the dark fey who had helped Cvaal Daoran to save Phlan from the shadovars ire a century before. Thus he started living in the Kabels Hill community, searching for lore about the fey of the forest. In the end, Halvin went out to meet with the hag Jeny Greenteeth, but the negotiation did not go well and she killed him.\nHalvin had an imp familiar called Pypyap."
