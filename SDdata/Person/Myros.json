        "mainbody": "Myros was a Red Wizard operating out of the Thayan Enclave in the Shadowfell city of Evernight during the late 15 century DR.\nShe had devised a ritual to transform the essence of slain Shadovar spellcasters into \"Keys of Night\" that could be used to bypass Netherese defenses.\nAs a member of the Thayan mission in Evernight, Myros worked to undermine Netherese activities in the city, and in particular, she targeted the Shadovar ambassador.\nDuring the crisis appearance of the Cloaked Ascendancy in Neverwinter, a hero from Neverwinter was directed to Myros for help in accessing the Shard of Night. Myros agreed to help fashion a Key of Night to get the hero inside, but required that they slay the Shadovar ambassador in Evernight, Kaross, and collect her \"essence\". Myros neglected to tell the hero that slaying Kaross would cause the hungry undead of the city to turn on them."
