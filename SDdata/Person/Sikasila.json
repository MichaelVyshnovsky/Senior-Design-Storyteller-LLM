        "mainbody": "Sikasila was a marilith Commander of the order who served Lolth in the Demonweb Pits in the late 15 century DR.\nLike others of her kin, Sikasila was a fiend with a lower body of a green-scaled serpent and six-armed amazonian warriors torso. She had green hair and glowing yellow eyes.\nSikasila was known as one of the most skilled member of her order in wielding deadly blades. Her swordsmanship was made deadly by the use of defensive magics in combat, such as mirror image.\nIt was said that Sikasilas battle prowess and military mastery left many long-forgotten civilizaions in ruin. In the late 15 century DR, Gromph Baenre, the drow Archmage of Menzoberranzan, successfully activated the Realm Engine in order to summon Lolth to the City of Spiders. Even though the summoning failed, Abyssal incursion of the Demonweb Pits began spilling into the Prime Material plane, threatening to swallow Menzoberranzan. Sikasila was one of the ranking Commanders who led the invading fiends into Narbondel."
