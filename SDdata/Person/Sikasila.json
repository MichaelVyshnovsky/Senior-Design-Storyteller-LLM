        "mainbody": "'''Sikasila''' was a [[marilith]] Commander of the order who served [[Lolth]] in the [[Demonweb Pits]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Like others of her kin, Sikasila was a [[fiend]] with a lower body of a green-scaled [[serpent]] and six-armed [[amazon]]ian warrior's torso. She had green hair and glowing yellow eyes.",
        "Abilities": "Sikasila was known as one of the most skilled member of her order in wielding deadly blades. Her swordsmanship was made deadly by the use of defensive magics in combat, such as ''[[mirror image]]''.",
        "History": "It was said that Sikasila's battle prowess and military mastery left many long-forgotten civilizaions in ruin. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Gromph Baenre]], the [[drow]] [[Archmage]] of [[Menzoberranzan]], successfully activated the ''[[Realm Engine]]'' in order to summon [[Lolth]] to the City of Spiders. Even though the summoning failed, [[Abyssal]] incursion of the Demonweb Pits began spilling into the [[Prime Material plane]], threatening to swallow Menzoberranzan. Sikasila was one of the ranking Commanders who led the invading fiends into [[Narbondel]]."
