{{Quote|Never put your trust in a conman.|Forge Fitzwilliam}}

==Description==
{{quote|''He has those soulful eyes and that face that's a little bit swoony, but at the same time I kind of want to punch him. You ever know anyone like that?''|Edgin Darvis on Forge}}
Even as an older man, Forge was handsome and had a bright smile. In his former days as a thief and confidence trickster, he made do with well-worn and unremarkable clothing. But as Lord of Neverwinter, he favored finer and elegant attire, typically loose white shirts, flowing capes, waistcoats or vests, and neckerchiefs, under a gold-brocaded coat, with an ornate belt and rings and a [[gold]] [[amulet]] set with an [[emerald]] gem on a chain about his neck.

==Personality==
{{quote|''Oh, look how you glow. I can see the envy that claws at your heart, though you try to hide it. Such lovely flaws and weaknesses and hidden truths...''|Drueena the green hag to Forge}}
His morality was malleable, if not absent altogether, and he used a charming smile, flattery, and lies to manipulate people—and backstab them given the opportunity. Even when caught lying, he would keep on lying to disorient and divide people. He had a taste for wealth and its trappings, especially that which he'd won himself, and would complain extravagantly if things were not just how he preferred them, such as if his [[tea]] was too hot. He was audacious in his schemes and never satisfied, instead growing ever more ambitious.

==Abilities==
[[File:Honor Among Thieves publicity image 9.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Also style, swagger, and a complete lack of shame.'']]
With his charm, Forge could disarm his foes, appearing less of a threat in combat, and he could also easily dodge attacks and evade harmful effects. He would cunningly escape to advantageous locations from which to strike back. However, he was most deadly to his own former allies whom he'd double-crossed and taken by surprise. His weapons were coated with [[poison]].

Skilled in the arts of the thief, he was agile and stealthy, persuasive and deceptive, and also skilled in investigation and sleight of hand.

==Possessions==
He fought with a [[dagger]]

==History==
===Early Life===
Forge would later blame his crooked ways on his mother's strictness and temper, such as berating him when he broke a jug. It is arguable if this is true or not, however.

Over decades in the latter 1400s DR, Forge had carried on his dishonest trade in cities up and down the [[Sword Coast]], pulling a variety of heists and scams under many false identities, and leaving as broken promises and thefts in his wake.

===Thief===
[[File:Simon and amazing thieves.png|thumb|left|250px|''Forge, Edgin, Simon, and Holga, alleged heroes.'']]
In the early 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Forge had a chance meeting with two other thieves, the [[bard]] Edgin and [[barbarian]] Holga, at the [[Trip and Shuffle]] tavern in [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. With Holga's encouragement, the out-of-practice bard Edgin attempted to sing for the audience, but consumed too much liquid courage, leading to his performance being a public failure. This was when Forge pranced in, seeing an easy mark. The thieves played [[Three-Dragon Ante]], but Edgin was better at noticing cheating while drunk, and Forge quickly recognized a fellow hustler. The competition between two cheats was cut short by a raiding party of [[gnoll]]s, who started a fight but got away with the thieves' gold. Edgin, Holga, and Forge pursued the raiders to retrieve their stolen [[coin]]. The group ended up saving a Targossan child, [[Sief Talvick]], Edgin's neighbor's kid, who'd been taken by the gnolls. This rescue made the trio heroes in the eyes of the locals.

Soon after, Forge waltzed into Edgin's life once again, having found two villagers whose drinking buddy had gone missing, along with several other people. The villagers were offering a hefty donation for the rescue, and Forge thought the job to be easy money. Forge convinced Edgin to travel to a "haunted" island just off the Sword Coast. There, Edgin, Holga, and Forge found a single survivor: the [[sorcerer]] Simon, who'd been hired by the villagers but had gone missing. The young [[half-elf]] convinced the thieves to rescue him in exchange for intel that would lead them to a greater mark: the estate of the wealthy and eccentric [[dragonborn]] [[wizard]] [[Torlinn Shrake]]. Subsequently, a [[green hag]] named [[Drueena]] was revealed to be responsible for the disappearances. With the sorcerer's help, the group ended the creature's life but received no reward.

Finally, one night whilst they were celebrating a score at the Trip and Shuffle tavern in Targos, a mysterious hooded figure calling herself "Lady [[Sofina]]" met the team. She wanted to hire them to help her steal the treasures of [[Korinn's Keep]], a Harper storehouse that only a Harper could enter—Edgin. He refused, however, still having some standards. But Forge promised they would find there a ''[[tablet of reawakening]]'', a magical relic capable of [[resurrection|resurrecting one deceased soul]]. Against his better judgement but with hopes of restoring his wife [[Zia]] to life, Edgin relented and acquiesced to Forge's and Sofina's scheme.

Donning his old Harper uniform, Edgin led the team to Korinn's Keep and gained admittance. While the thieves helped themselves to the treasures of the vault, and Sofina claimed a strange red horn, Edgin went for the ''tablet of reawakening''. But the poor thief triggered an alarm, summoning Harper guards, whom Sofina struck with ''[[chain lightning]]'', to Edgin's dismay. She then cast ''[[time stop]]'', trapping the guards, Holga, and Edgin while she, Forge, and Simon made their escape. Edgin's last act was to throw the Tablet to Forge and beg him to take care of Kira. Forge gave his word, for what that was worth. In fact, he'd always planned to double-cross them, having thrown his lot in with Sofina. As Forge watched, Sofina tried to kill Simon, as they'd never intended for him to escape Korinn's Keep, and the sorcerer only just got away with his life.

===Lord of Neverwinter===
{{fq
| text   = But there are things I need to accomplish first before I really think about settling down, and one particular mountain I have yet to climb, so to speak. Neverwinter. That's the prize I've always coveted. The wealth in that city is staggering, and it’s all just ripe for the taking.

Afterward, Forge collected Kira from Targos and together they moved to Neverwinter. For two years, dear 'Uncle Forge' lied to the girl and turned her against her father, until Kira thought he'd just abandoned her to seek more riches, that is, the so-called "Tablet of Riches". Forge kept the real ''tablet of reawakening'' hidden and never shared Edgin's true reasons. He presented himself as having turned over a new leaf.

When Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] suddenly took ill—Forge seized the opportunity. He waged a political campaign for lordship of Neverwinter financed with his ill-gotten gains, in which he described Neverwinter's leaders as "corrupt and inept". Successful, he became Lord of Neverwinter

However, not all were swayed. The [[wood elves]] of the [[Neverwinter Wood]] resisted his rule, so Forge painted them as enemies and traitors. He sent his forces to capture and execute them and dispatched loggers who cut ever deeper into the woods, abandoning sensible logging practices. Doric, a druid of the [[Emerald Enclave]] would lead the fightback.

But Forge and Sofina's real scheme was far larger and more terrible in scope. One of the Forge's main acts was to revive the [[High Sun Games]], a monster-filled bloodsport that had been banned by Lord Neverember as he considered them too brutal. Forge also ordered the construction of the [[Neverwinter arena]] to host the Games.{{speculation}}<ref group="note">As no structure of the kind has been seen or mapped in Neverwinter before, the arena is presumed to be new and built by Forge. The timber from the Neverwinter Wood may have gone into its construction. The first Games were to be held in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} allegedly as a way of bringing the city together. It also brought many visitors from outside Neverwinter, including rich, powerful, and unscrupulous people—people like [[Din Caldwell]] and [[Porb Piiradost]], two of the wealthiest men of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Waterdeep]] of the day, who wanted to bet big on the Games and brought their riches with them. He even raised a [[hot-air balloon]] over the city with his own grinning face on it.

[[File:Honor Among Thieves Sofina, Forge, and Kira.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''In fact, this meeting went colder than Forge's tea.'']]
Meanwhile, after two years imprisoned in [[Revel's End]], Edgin and Holga escaped and came to Castle Never to retrieve Kira and the ''tablet of reawakening'', but they had a less-than-warm reception. Lord Forge kept them waiting, spent more time complaining about his tea, and Kira was now eleven years old and estranged from her father. But Sofina told Blackwood to kill them in secret, though they would escape. Afterward, Forge met with Kira, pretending to console her, but lied to her still, cruelly claiming he'd given Edgin and Holga the 'Tablet of Riches' and they'd simply left without her.

Later, Forge and Sofina showed Din Caldwell and Porb Piiradost around Castle Never, boasting of its upgraded security and suitability for storing their wealth in its vault, which was protected with a powerful ''[[Mordenkainen's arcane seal]]''. However, they were interrupted when Sofina sensed the presence of a [[wild shape]]d [[druid]]—Doric, now an ally of Edgin and Holga—spying on them, but she escaped Sofina and the castle guards. Forge was correct in his suspicion that this was Edgin's doing, but Sofina vowed to send her own forces to get rid of the gang.

[[File:Forge Fitzwilliam.png|thumb|right|250px|''Forge basks in the applause of the arena crowd, no doubt relieved there is no white wyrm.'']]
Finally, Forge opened the High Sun Games at the Neverwinter arena from atop one of the moveable pillars, though he was not comfortable with the height of it. Addressing the crowd and announcing the rules of the competition, he asked that no one leave the arena until the very end, promising "a wonderful gift" to each of the spectators. However, at the same time, Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric had returned to Neverwinter with a plan to rob Forge of his fortune, retrieve the ''tablet of reawakening'', and rescue Kira. They infiltrated Castle Never and broke into the vault, but found Forge had already stolen all the riches within, including those of his guests, having had it loaded aboard an armored ship. The would-be thieves were captured by guards and Sofina's ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'' spell. Forge met the captive Edgin in Kira's room in the castle and taunted him and abandoned him to die, but Edgin pleaded for a fighting chance, that is, to compete in the High Sun Games. Though Forge was reluctant, perhaps to spare Edgin a fate worse than death, Sofina agreed that they should suffer for defeating her assassins and Forge's guards.

===Betrayer of Neverwinter===
Afterward, Forge took his place in the luxury balcony over the arena, with Sofina and Din Caldwell, Porb Piiradost, and the other wealthy gamblers. At last, their respective schemes had come to fruition: Forge had stolen the riches of the castle and his wealthy guests and had it all loaded aboard a ship for his getaway as he abandoned the city, and Sofina had all the people gathered together in the arena—a perfect target for the [[Beckoning Death]], turning the whole city into [[undead]], and bringing about [[Szass Tam]]'s plan to seize control of Neverwinter. Though Forge tried an amiable farewell, Sofina coldly ordered him to get out of her city, in a hurry to be rid of him now their partnership was at an end.

Forge collected Kira and hastened with her to the city's docks to abscond on the treasure ship. But Edgin and his friends had escaped the arena and got there first, seized the treasure ship from the guards, and ambushed Forge. Edgin apologized to Kira and called her to him, which was when Forge showed his true colors and took her hostage, threatening the child with a knife. Fortunately, a well-thrown [[potato]] from Holga took care of him, smashing into Forge's face. Kira fled back into Edgin's care and the team sailed away on the boat. Simon cast ''[[control water]]'' to create a big wave to aid their escape aboard the ship, incidentally washing over the docks and Forge, leaving him soaked.

Once Forge recovered, he tried to get Harbormaster [[Jimn]]—or, as he called him, "harbormaster person"—to organize a boat to pursue. However, Jimn was distracted by the sight of Sofina invoking the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the Neverwinter arena and just then the treasure ship drifted out of control back into port, crashing into a boat. Looking inside, Forge saw all his precious treasure draining away into a ''[[portal]]'', out of his hot-air balloon, and over the streets of Neverwinter, all part of Edgin's plan to save the people and thwart Sofina. All Forge could recover was an oversized [[gold]] chalice.

===Prisoner===
With the cumbersome chalice still under his arm, Forge fled the city. Stumbling through a forest one night, the fugitive lord was encountered by the [[paladin]] [[Xenk Yendar]], who returned him to face justice. While Lord Dagult Neverember resumed his rule of Neverwinter, Forge was incarcerated in Revel's End. A year later, the [[Absolution Council]] considered him for pardon, but summarily rejected him after hearing only a part of his statement with all of his excuses. That was when Forge made a sudden escape attempt, grabbing the [[aarakocra]] councilor [[Jarnathan]] and trying to use him to fly out the window, just as Edgin and Holga had done over a year before, only to find the window now bricked up and leaving the pair of them stunned.
