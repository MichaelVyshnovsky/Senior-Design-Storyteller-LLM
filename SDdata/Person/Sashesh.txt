Lady '''Sashesh''' was a powerful and influential merchant, as well as the representative of [[Sembia]] in [[Scardale]] in [[1368 DR]].

==Activities==
Sashesh was a trade liaison that was the principal agent of a cabal of wealthy merchants that wanted to make Scardale part of Sembia. She worked toward this goal by dominating trade and with occasional brides, using the [[Sembian garrison (Scardale)|Sembian garrison]] as her headquarters.
