Khafaz ibn Dahz was a trader and caravan master in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Khafaz had handsome features and appeared well groomed. Though in his mid-40s, his lean frame made him appear much younger.
Khafaz was a devious man. He often blamed others for misfortunes.
His basic equipment included leather armor, a dagger, some darts, and a short sword. Khafaz owned a valuable brooch shaped like a camels head and two silver bracelets. He also carried a flask that had two doses of a potion of healing.
Khafaz learned his skills as a teenager on the streets of Tajar. He eventually saved enough money to purchase ships to carry goods to Huzuz and send caravans across the High Desert. He was very knowledgeable with the geography of the High Desert.
