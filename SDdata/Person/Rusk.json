        "mainbody": "Huntmaster Rusk was a cleric of Malar.\nRusk once loved Maleva.\nRusk was born as a natural werewolf in a community where people worshiped all nature gods Silvanus, Chauntea, Malar, and Eldath. For many years, he was welcomed among both humans and wolves, gaining a reputation as a ranger in the Dalelands and Sembia.\nHe was in love with Maleva, a powerful cleric of Selûne. She told Rusk about the Black Wolf prophecy, a heresy shared by both worshipers of Selûne and worshipers of Malar.\nRusk later became a hunter of renown. He was hired by Vilsek Malveen of Selgaunt as a guide. Soon he gathered followers and started arguing with Maleva, who wanted him to convert to Selùnes faith. Breaking with Maleva Rusk, he instead joined the People of the Black Blood.\nIn 1372 DR, Stannis Malveen contacted Rusk, offering a rare copy of the Black Wolf Scroll in exchange for infecting with lycanthropy a member of the Uskevren family.\nRusk feared he would no longer be the chosen vessel of Malar, and even that he might never have been. He feared he had himself created the individual that would become the new champion of Malar."
