        "mainbody": "Ylveraasahlisar, also known as the Rose Dragon, was an infamous red dragon that ruled Calimshan for more than a century.\nYlveraasahlisar was a great wyrm who laired in the Cloud Peaks. In , a group of Calishite adventurers crept into her lair to steal some of her treasure hoard, killing one of her brood in the process.\nAfter this incident, an enraged Ylveraasahlisar attacked Calimport, destroying two-thirds of the city including the Calephs Court and the Raor bakkal, along with most of Calimshans army. After the bloodbath, she seized the throne and her first edict was to reconstruct all she had destroyed. In a hurry to comply, her terrified subjects merely leveled the rubble enough to support new construction and began anew, thus creating much of the Muzad.\nYlveraasahlisar ruled until  when Rafak el Cajaan organized her demise. He gathered a group of dragonslayers, including a bronze dragon named Cadasalmpar, that attacked the Rose Dragon by surprise in her court. After a fierce battle, she escaped from Calimport gravely wounded. Cadasalmpar tracked her down and administered the killing bite."
