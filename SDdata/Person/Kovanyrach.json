        "mainbody": "'''Kovanyrach''' was a mighty [[white dragon]] who laired in the [[Frozenfar]], and who proved powerful enough to unite many of their fellow white dragons in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Kovanyrach was descended from white dragons who had fought a war with the [[frost giant]]s of [[Thrymstone]] and perished after destroying the giants' fortress in the catastrophe that created [[Dragonscar Gorge]]. Because of this, they were very sensitive about any efforts to reclaim or unearth the ruins of Thrymstone.",
        "History": "When [[Shattercrown]], the supposed original builder of [[Thrymstone]], returned in the late 15{{th}} century DR to excavate that fortress's ruins with the labor of the [[Frosthunger Horde]], Kovanyrach was roused to unite their normally solitary white dragon brethren to thwart the  frost giant's plan. The engaged dragons descended on Dragonscar Gorge, scarring the land and forcing the Horde to abandon most of its excavation sites aside from the main gate of Thrymstone itself. This fight alarmed the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Laeral Silverhand]], who already had [[adventurer]]s in the area working to drive the Frosthunger Horde out of [[Shimmersky Valley]]. She feared that if Kovanyrach's white dragons and Shattercrown's frost giants were to fight directly, the conflict could spiral into a new war between [[dragon]]s and [[giant]]s which could threaten all of [[Faerûn]].\n\nKovanyrach and their allies finally flew to attack the frost giant camp on a stormy day, but were intercepted by Silverhand's adventurers. The two groups battled within sight of the frost giants, who seemed content to let their enemies destroy each other. Meanwhile, Kovanyrach made the mistake of holding back their strength in anticipation of battling the giants, and was forced to retreat by the adventurers. With the dragons out of the way, the adventurers turned their attention on the giants and slew Shattercrown. They then allowed Kovanyrach and the dragons to harry the frost giants as they fled the Gorge."
