Tsabanor Oblodra was the house patron of House Oblodra and the mate of Matron Mother Kyorl Odran circa 1358 DR.
Tsabanor was a pathetic figure in his house, and lived only with Kyorls permission. She taunted and tormented him constantly. He often considered hurling himself into the Clawrift to end his suffering.
Tsabanor was chosen by Matron Mother Kyorl as patron for his latent psionic powers. He was once a skilled speaker, but Kyorl cut his tongue out because he had spoken to her too often. From that point on he lived a pathetic life.
He had latent psionic powers.
