'''Hadrion''', who recently changed his name from '''Hadiron''', was a [[half-elf]] [[thief]] inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Rumors abounded that Hadrion had [[dwarf]] blood running through his veins. He changed his name from Hadiron with the hopes that the removal of the "iron" from his name would dissuade such rumors, but it ultimately proved to make no difference.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
