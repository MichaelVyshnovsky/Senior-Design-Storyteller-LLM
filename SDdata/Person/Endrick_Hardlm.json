        "mainbody": "Commander Endrick Hardlm was the Amnian Council Army officer in charge of Citadel Amnur during the mid-14 century DR, until his untimely death by dragon.\nHardlm was an indecisive and incompetent commander, unable to set his mind on a goal and follow through. He wavered between wanting his soldiers to love him, fear him, and respect him, and as a result got nothing.\nEndrick Hardlm had a very expensive set of armor, including +4 scale mail and a +4 shield. It was widely regarded as the best thing about him.\nHardlm won his posting at the prestigious Citadel Amnur sometime before 1356 DR thanks to his familys political connections and wealth. Once in charge of the fortress, he proceeded to mismanage it horrendously and badly degraded the morale and discipline of the troops. As no emergencies erupted which required his efforts, his incompetence went largely unnoticed by the world outside of his command.\nHardlms moment of glory came in 1369 DR when a huge red dragon suddenly erupted from its lair nearby and attacked Citadel Amnur. Instead of ravaging the disorganized fortress, the creature toyed with its food, eating seven horses and a few brave crossbowmen who had rallied to fight it. Hardlm finally emerged from hiding and surrendered to the dragon, and was quickly eaten, fancy armor and all. Moments later, the blue dragon Araugauthos arrived and killed the other wyrm, then met with Captain Arilan Krimmevol to discuss historical events. Naturally, Hardlm did not witness Krimmevols subsequent tenure as commander of the fortress."
