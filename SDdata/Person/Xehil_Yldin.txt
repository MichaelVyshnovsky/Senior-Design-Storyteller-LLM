'''Xehil Yldin''' was a [[lich]] inhabiting the [[Battle of Bones]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Personality==
Xehil possessed an uncanny ability to work with others to further his own goals. He was known to associate with [[drow]] and the [[Zhentarim]] on occasion.

==Abilities==
A wide array of magical [[spell]]s was at Xehil's disposal.

==Possessions==
Xehil was known to possess a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'' (containing ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', and ''[[hold monster]]''), a ''[[wand of enfeeblement]]'', a ''[[cloak of the manta ray]]'', and a [[dagger]] coated with [[drow poison]]. 

==Activities==
Xehil was rumored to collect many of the wandering [[undead]] of the Battle of Bones and to add them to his personal army.

==History==
At one point, Xehil worked with the drow occupying the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]]. He disappeared from those lands long before the rise of the [[Lords of Shadowdale]].
