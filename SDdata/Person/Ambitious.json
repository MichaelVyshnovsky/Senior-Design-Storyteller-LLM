        "Activities": "The cage that Ambitious lived in featured an artificial dirt bank, with a hole to serve as his shelter. It also featured trays full of tall [[grass]]es that were frequently changed and put outside to keep them fresh. His body frequently bristled whenever visitors stopped by his cage, seemingly enjoying the attention.",
        "History": "Over the course of time he lived in Marigold's Menagerie, Ambitious was not once known to fire his quills at anyone."
