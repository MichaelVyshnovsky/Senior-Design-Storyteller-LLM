        "mainbody": "Ambitious was a porcupine who lived in a corner cage in Marigolds Menagerie in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe cage that Ambitious lived in featured an artificial dirt bank, with a hole to serve as his shelter. It also featured trays full of tall grasses that were frequently changed and put outside to keep them fresh. His body frequently bristled whenever visitors stopped by his cage, seemingly enjoying the attention.\nOver the course of time he lived in Marigolds Menagerie, Ambitious was not once known to fire his quills at anyone."
