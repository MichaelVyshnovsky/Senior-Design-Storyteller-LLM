Sirhan min Hajama was the Imam of the Midnight Mosque in Liham in 1367 DR.
Sirhan was a cheerful individual.
He desperately wanted to retrieve a relic rumored to be the heart of the Lion of Suja. He believed that successfully retrieving the relic would bring him enough prosperity to fend off attacks from holy slayers.
