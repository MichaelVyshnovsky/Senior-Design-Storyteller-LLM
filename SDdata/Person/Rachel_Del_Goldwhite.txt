'''Rachel Del Goldwhite''' was the [[raven]]-haired princess of the [[Del Goldwhite]] noble family from the town of [[Longsaddle]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Rachel became the target of [[Falhnen Battlescar]]'s affections. The lowly descendant of slaves and peasants was not worthy Rachel's hand in the eyes of her father. The patriarch of House Del Goldwhite swore to kill Falhnen on sight. To gain coin and reputation, Falhnen left Longsaddle with the hopes of becoming worthy of Rachel Del Goldwhite's affections.
