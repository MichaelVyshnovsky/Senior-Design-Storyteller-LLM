==Description==
Balgor was a stout well-dressed [[dwarf]] with golden-brown skin and reddish brown beard and blue eyes. He wore a quality jacket and a simple wide-brimmed hat.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Unlike his friends [[Sylvie Summerworth]] and [[Randalf]], Balgor was worried over the looming army. While Sylvie ranted over missing mail, Balgor was annoyed by her caring more about post rather than possible description of Rivington in a war with the Absolute.
