        "mainbody": "Hoond, known as the \"Despoiler of Tombs\", was a notorious thief of Shussel in Unther, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nWhen Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur and her dowry went missing in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Hoond of Shussel was one of three thieves named as suspects by High Suikh (king) Helbareim Alanasker, but was innocent. Hoond could well have gone looking for the real thief, perhaps deciding to have the loot as well as the blame."
