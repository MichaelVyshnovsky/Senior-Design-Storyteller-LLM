'''Hssthak''' (Eeesss-TAK)

==Description==
At first glance, Hssthak appeared human under his loose wrappings, but the bony tail and dry, snake-like skin drawn taut over his skeleton quickly dispelled that impression. Having been sealed in a tomb for thousands of years, his features were distorted, withered, and dry.

==Abilities==
Hssthak was a "greater" mummy, having volunteered to undergo the mummification process; thus, he retained all the spell casting abilities he had in life and gained all the abilities of a mummy. In addition, he was enchanted to be [[resist fire|fire resistant]]. With millennia to brood and watch the world through his [[scrying]] device, he was generally aware of world events and could converse haltingly in most languages.

==Possessions==
Hssthak had a magic mirror that functioned as a ''[[crystal ball]]'' with ''[[Clairaudience/clairvoyance|clairaudience]]'' and a scroll inscribed with the ''[[geas]]'' spell. He was the custodian of two powerful ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'': ''[[awaken intelligence]]'' and ''[[alter beast]]''. 

==Activities==
He waited patiently in the [[Crypt of Hssthak]] for the day when he would be called upon to teach magic to lesser [[lizardfolk]]. In his crypt he kept two of the ''Golden Skins of the World Serpent'', aka the ''Nether Scrolls''.

==Relationships==
Hssthak considered all non-reptilian races to be marginally better than lowly beasts.

==History==
Around {{Yearlink|-6000}}, [[elf|elves]] from [[Evereska]] discovered the crypt but judged its contents too dangerous for the world to know. Thus, a half-dozen elves volunteered to be made into mummies so to guard the crypt for eternity. Afterward, the door was resealed and the tomb reburied with elven magic. The [[Netherese]] never discovered Hssthak due to it being beneath unremarkable flatlands.

In [[1372 DR]], a deep sinkhole occurred near an oasis by the eastern end of the [[Frozen Sea]], revealing the entrance to the tomb. Soon after, lizard folk and an adventuring party delved into the new find.
