Angaar, son of Raag, was a Reghedmen warrior of the Tribe of the Wolf in the late 13 century DR, who joined the Tribe of the Great Wyrm under the leadership of reanimated King Wylfdene to wage war on the Ten-Towns.
In the , Icasaracht, an ancient undead dragon, reanimated the course of a great barbarian leader, Wylfdene Wylfdene and Icasaracht raised a great army to conquer Icewind Dale and destroy the settlements of the Ten Towns. The new tribe was named the Tribe of the Great Wyrm and assembled members of other tribes of the north.
When Wylfdenes Tribe of the Great Wyrm moved south towards Kelvins Cairn and set up a war camp near Lonelywood, the speakers of Ten Towns saw the looming war â€“ a familiar sight and hired an assassin to pose as a Ten Towns representative. Angaar was the camp guard who stood watch of the main gate. He went to the "representative" and witnessed what would soon occur. The assassin was discovered, tortured, and murdered during a meeting with Wylfdene, his head placed on a pike as a warning, and the security was tightened. Angaar witnessed the meeting and torture, and it unnerved him. He believed that under torture, the representative of the Ten Towns wouldve confessed to anything just to end the suffering. When the Heroes of Icewind Dale were summoned to aid the Ten Towns, Angaar coldly greeted the heroes and accompanied them to the camp in their attempt to negotiate. The meeting ended poorly, and Wylfdene ordered them to be executed, and Angaar was to see it done along with six other Reghedmen. It was unknown if the heroes and Angaar battled eachother, resulting in his death, or if they negotiated their way out of the cruel order. However, one thing was sure Angaar told the heroes of where Wylfdenes shaman was exiled to, the Burial Isle, stating that eventually, Hjollder would either starve to death or die of cold.
