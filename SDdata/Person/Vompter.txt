'''Vompter''' was an employee of [[Sorcerous Sundries]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Vompter was one of the assistants to the [[mage]] [[Lorroakan]] of Sorcerous Sundries in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. At some point before 1492 DR, Vompter and [[Miklaur]], another one of Lorroakan's assistants, were involved in an incident with a three-eyed man, after which Miklaur refused to talk to Vompter, prompting further communications via letters. One such letter was an order from the master conveyed by Vompter. Miklaur was to collect the newly-acquired inhabited ''[[genie lamp]]'' and place it within the vaults of [[Ramazith's tower]] behind a protective wall as the [[lamp]] was too dangerous to be openly displayed in Sorcerous Sundries.
