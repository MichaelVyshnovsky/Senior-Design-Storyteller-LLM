Dmetrio Extaminos was a male yuan-ti pureblood sorcerer or fighter of Hlondeth in the Vilhon Reach in the late 14 century DR.
He served as the ambassador of Hlondeth to the nation of Sespech.
Dmetrio was also the leader of the Cult of the Dragon in Hlondeth.
He was the son of Dediana Extaminos, ruler of Hlondeth. He was also courting Glisena Foesmasher, the daughter of Baron Thuragar Foesmasher of Sespech, making the relationship between Hlondeth and Sespech somewhat tense, as neither Glisena nor Thuragar were interested, but dared not offend Hlondeth, so they did not completely rebuff his advances.
