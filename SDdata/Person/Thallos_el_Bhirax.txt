'''Thallos yn Sarsor el Bhilax yi Almraiven''' was a [[Calishite]] weaponsmaster and a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Thallos inherited his position in the Knights from his grandfather, [[Tahir el Bhirax]]. However, Tahir's son, [[Sarsor el Bhirax|Sarsor yn Tahir el Bhirax]] became a crazed cultist of [[Umberlee]], losing all his money in devotion to the Sea Bitch. So Tahir transferred the Knights' position to Sarsor's son, Thallos. Thallos fled his home city, and after a time as an adventurer, settled in [[Keltar]], gaining a name as weaponsmaster for the [[Laamil]] clan. A series of good business deals made together with his employer and friend [[Alzhedo dictionary#A|Amhir]] [[Rabi el Lammil]] gave Thallos for the first time the will to use his Knights' connections for more lucrative business dealings.
