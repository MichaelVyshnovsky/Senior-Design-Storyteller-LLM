        "Description": "Zorkh was mute; he could understand the [[Giant language]] but could not speak.",
        "Activities": "Zorkh lived as hermit in the [[Greypeak Mountains]]. He was always followed by six [[goat]]s. He reacted friendlily to people.",
        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], the stone giants of Thane [[Kayalithica]] destroyed every building of the village [[Orlbar]]. Afterward, Zorkh decided to collect all the stones of the destroyed buildings, stacking them in creative ways, thus obtaining a \"forest\" of piled-up stones."
