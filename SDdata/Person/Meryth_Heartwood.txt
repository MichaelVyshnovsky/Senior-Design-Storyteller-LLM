Meryth Heartwood was a spellscarred resident of Helms Hold and a member of the Heirs of Azure political movement that arose in the city during the late 15 century DR.
Unlike the more extreme followers of the movement, Meryth advocated for peaceful resistance against the anti-spellscared sentiments that were so strong among her fellow citizens.
Meryth held the culture of Illefarn with great reverence, particularly the form of artistry known as song paths, portal networks associated with performances of hours-long poems.
Meryth was a devout believer in the movement led by the half-elf spellscarred Halas, as well as the all-inclusive oration offered by the Prophet Rohini. She was wholly disillusioned when Rohini revealed herself to be the leader of the Ashmadai, and cleansed Halas and many of his followers of their spellscars, in exchange for their devotion to the devil-worshiping Ashmadai. 
During the Siege of Helms Hold, circa the , Meryth joined a resistance group operating at a camp at the edge of the Watchers Forest. She found comrades among the group, including her fellow elf Dassar Truebow, a hedge wizard named Nottin, and the merchant Kella the Fair-Dealing. She worked with fellow elven adventurers to help recover stolen relics from Illefarn, and prevent the Ashmadai from opening asong paths within the city.
