Shex is an angel of decay, an undead monstrosity — an avatar, the very essence of rot.
Shex is as tall as an ogre and has wings and claws. Her body constantly decomposes, slime oozing down her frame to pool at her feet. She speaks with a slurred, muddy voice.
Together with the Nighthaunt Ysval, Shex was a field commander for an army of undead trying to conquer Thay in 1375 DR. She was slain by the ghost Mirror at the fight of Thazar Keep. Whether she was ultimately destroyed or just sent back to her home plane is not known.
