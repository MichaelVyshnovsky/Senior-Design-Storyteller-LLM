'''Shex''' is an [[angel of decay]], an [[undead]] monstrosity — an avatar, the very essence of rot.

==Appearance==
Shex is as tall as an ogre and has wings and claws. Her body constantly decomposes, slime oozing down her frame to pool at her feet. She speaks with a slurred, muddy voice.

==History==
Together with the [[Nighthaunt]] [[Ysval]], Shex was a field commander for an army of undead trying to conquer [[Thay]] in [[1375 DR]]. She was slain by the [[ghost]] [[Mirror (ghost)|Mirror]] at the fight of [[Keep of Thazar|Thazar Keep]]. Whether she was ultimately destroyed or just sent back to her home plane is not known.
