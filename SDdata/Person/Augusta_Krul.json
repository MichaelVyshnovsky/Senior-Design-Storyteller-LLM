Together with Aubrey Silverspun and Ogri Ninebeards, the other two members of the Swords of Leilon, Augusta protected Leilon before its fall. The Spellplague of 1385 DR broke the magical wards of the High Tower of Thalivar and released all of the monsters within, who then killed the towers wizard, Thalivar, and rampaged through the village. The Swords battled to cover the townsfolks escape. They died, becoming bound to Leilons ruins as ghosts.\nBy the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild both Leilon and the High Tower of Thalivar. Augusta kept a close eye on the towns reconstruction, hoping that the repaired tower would not cause another calamity. When Thalivars ghost began haunting the tower, Augusta watched over a group of adventurers who laid the ghost to rest.\nAugusta and the other Swords of Leilon helped defend Leilon during the Battle of Leilon, a three-way battle in which Leilon was besieged by both the Cult of Talos and the Cult of Myrkul. Together with a group of adventurers, they fought against Ebondeath, who had possessed the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar."
