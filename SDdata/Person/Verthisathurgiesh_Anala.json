        "mainbody": "'''Verthisathurgiesh Anala''' was the [[dragonborn]] matriarch of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]] in [[1486 DR]]. She was a direct descendant of [[Khorsaya]].",
        "Description": "Anala was lithe and loose-limbed, with damp brick-colored scales and black plumes hanging neatly to her shoulders. She was tall for a female dragonborn.",
        "Relationships": "Anala was the younger sister of [[Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed|Pandjed]], and the aunt of [[Mehen]]. She was the mother of [[Verthisathurgiesh Baruz|Baruz]].",
        "History": "In [[1486 DR]], Anala became the matriarch of the clan after the death of her brother, Pandjed.\n\nTo save her clan's reputation, Anala asked [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]] for permission to recall all the exiled members and offered them to reinstate them into the clan.  She also arranged the marriages of the young members of the clan with promising members of the other well-of Thymari clans, to ensure strong alliances in the future.\n\nOn [[Nightal]] of 1486 DR, Anala invited her nephew Mehen to [[Djerad Thymar]] in hopes to convince him to rejoining the clan. However, her third son, Baruz, was found dead the same day Mehen reached the city. Anala hired Mehen to help her uncover the assassin of her son.\n\nAs a \"reward\" for his services Anala lifted Mehen's exile and chose him as the candidate of Clan Verthisathurgiesh for the elections to chose the new [[Vanquisher]], that were expected to be celebrated in [[1487 DR]].\n\nIn the wake of the [[First Tymanther-Unther War]] and after Mehen's refusal, however, she changed her tactics and chose [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]] instead, allying with other clan elders, such as [[Yrjixtilex Vardhira]] and [[Fenkenkabradon Ishkhanak]], to accomplish her goal of forcing Mehen to return to Clan Verthisathurgiesh, and to outmaneuver her rivals, [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]]. She also arranged for [[Havilar]] to be allowed into the ranks of the [[Lance Defenders]]."
