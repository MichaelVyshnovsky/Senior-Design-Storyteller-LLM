On Eleint 7, Mibor and his war party came across Taegan Nightwind and Jivex. They attempted to slay them, but the two foreigners just barely escaped. Later, the war party was entranced by the song dragon Karasendrieth opportunistically attacked by the vampiric dragon Brimstone, they broke from the spell and attacked. They only broke from the attack once her party drove off the undead smoke drake, and offered their help in healing its victims.
