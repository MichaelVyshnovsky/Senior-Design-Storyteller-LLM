'''Mibor''' was a chieftain of the [[Far Quey]] tribe of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] in [[Narfell]] as of {{yearlink|1373}}. He was hulking, with a coarse face, and had a voice as deep as [[Dorn Graybrook]]'s.

==History==
On [[Eleint 7]], Mibor and his war party came across [[Taegan Nightwind]] and [[Jivex]]. They attempted to slay them, but the two foreigners just barely escaped. Later, the war party was entranced by the [[song dragon]] [[Karasendrieth]]; opportunistically attacked by the [[vampiric dragon]] [[Brimstone]], they broke from the spell and attacked. They only broke from the attack once her party drove off the undead [[smoke drake]], and offered their help in healing its victims.{{cite book/The Ruin||1}}
