'''Pavisi the Prophet''' was a person in the [[Utter East]]. 

Regarding the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]), Pavisi the Prophet remarked "Fate deserves the greatest acclaim. A victory loses its wonder when simple planning is given the credit." and "The Mage who has never known failure may be crushed with a single defeat."
