        "mainbody": "'''Dame Guisarme''' was a [[fighter]]-adventurer and a mercenary patron of the [[Elfsong Tavern]] from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|From one warrior to another, I must say, it's just embarrassing the way the [[Flaming Fist]] lets this murderer go around killing people and getting away with it. You don't need subtlety to sort these matters out, just persistence. That's what I told [[Liara Portyr|Commander Portyr]], anyway.|Dame Guisarme}}",
        "Description": "Guisarme was a [[gold dwarf]] woman with pale skin, brown eyes, and long blonde hair. She kept her face clean-shaven and her hair styled. She wore a set of mundane [[half plate armor]] and was armed with a simple [[longsword]] and a [[shield]].",
        "Relationships": "[[Dame Guisarme]] was [[barbarian]] [[Bombasto]]'s traveling companion, with whom he seemed to have a flirtatious and friendly-antagonistic relationship. She thought the barbarian's schemes and ideas were crazy but ended up getting involved in them anyway, but not before receiving a compliment from Bombasto and responding to it with a slap.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Dame Guisarme was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She was often seen dining or enjoying drinks with her mercenary adventuring companion, Bombasto. They liked to discuss the Flaming Fist mercenaries and commander Liara Portyr's inability to stop the rampant murders in the Gate. Dame Guisarme offered Commander Portyr her services but, evidently, was turned down. Guisarme was sure that the Flaming Fists would eventually fail to stop the murders and Liara Portyr would end up asking Guisarme's help.\n\nOne of Bombasto's adventures was his and Dame Guisarme's stand against [[hobgoblin]] raiders who held a wagonload of [[beer]]. Bombasto was thirsty and suggested the adventurers trade a wagonload of [[donkey]] [[shit]] for the hobgoblins' beer. Despite Dame Guisarme considering the idea crazy, Bombasto went on pushing a wagon of manure off a hill. It rolled down and pushed the hobgoblins' cart of beer forward, slaying in its place. Guisarme grabbed the beer wagon down in a ravine.\n\nDuring their time at the Elfsong Tavern, Bombasto and Guisarme contemplated accepting a job in East [[Chult]], guarding extractive safari out of [[Fort Beluarian]] with bonuses paid to all survivors."
