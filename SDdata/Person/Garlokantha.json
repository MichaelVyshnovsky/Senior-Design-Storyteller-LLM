She was saved by the [[Company of Eight]] in [[1354 DR]] from the hands of some evil adventurers, including the [[drow]] [[Tleobar]].\n\nGarlokantha preferred isolation and lived alone in her cave in the northeastern region of the forest, but about once every four years, she would take a [[humanoid]] form and travel through [[Tethyr]] and [[Amn]] to observe other races."
