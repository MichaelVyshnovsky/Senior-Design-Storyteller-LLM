        "mainbody": "l Narysr, which means \"The Phoenix\" in Alzhedo, was one of the most prolific prophets ever to live on Toril, with greater divinatory power than even Alaundo the Seer, famous for many thousands of predictions later recorded in a multi-volume work entitled The Phoenix Prophecies.\nThe Narysr, whose real name was lost to history, was one of the Abbalayar, He had reddish skin and golden-colored hair.\nThe Phoenix was a quiet man who rarely spoke, but when he felt a prophecy coming upon him, he spoke with boldness.\nThe Narysr was known to have had descendants, though only a few of these inherited his prophetic powers or distinct physical traits.\nThe Narysr lived in the time of Calimshans ancient past before even the end of the Calim Empire.This is known because it is explained in Empires of the Shining Sea that he foretold the Genie Wars. During his life, he gave thousands of cryptic prophecies.\nHis prophecies were recorded sometime in the tenth century DR by the Herald Swordswreath. She composed a seven-volume work from source fragments and a manuscript passed on by the Abbalayar prophet Kadh yn Ororm al Mjol. This opus was titled The Phoenix Prophecies. Among these more than 8,000 prophecies, the Narysr predicted the deaths of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul, the nine Ages of Calimshan, the Eye Tyrant Wars, the Time of Troubles, and the attack of the Tuigan Horde."
