'''Carras''' was a smuggler based in [[Amkethran]] in [[Amn]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
The smuggler owned a large amount of equipment with every single piece being enchanted. He used a [[longsword]], [[shortbow]], and arrows, as well as a very strongly enchanted returning [[throwing axe]], named ''[[K'logarath]]''. He also wore a pair of ''[[gargoyle boots]]'' and ''[[Enkidu's full plate]]''.

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], Carras was confronted by [[Balthazar]]'s monks, who demanded that he forfeit his merchandise to their monastery. They threatened to arrest and interrogate him if he didn't tell them where the chief smuggler [[Saemon Havarian|Esamon]] was. [[Gorion's Ward]] may have stepped in and saved the smuggler from the zealous monks. If so, Carras let the ward see his gear, at a discount. The day after, he and his band packed up his bags, in order to not be compromised by the death of Balthazar's mercenaries.
