        "mainbody": "Tobias was a guard at the Revels End prison on the Frozenfar in the late 15 century DR.\nOne day in the late 1490s DR, Tobias oversaw a chain-gang of prisoners as they cut blocks of ice from a river. He ordered Holga Kilgore and Edgin Darvis to shut up and get back to work. Then, when a prisoner fell through the ice into the river below, threatening to pull the whole chain-gang in after him, Tobias broke the chain with his longsword, sacrificing the prisoner to save the others. Tobias just told them to return to work. Edgin opined he was in a bad mood that day.\nHe was huge."
