'''Andrath Dragonarl''' was a patriotic Knight of [[Cormyr]] active ''circa'' [[430 DR]].

==History==
Even though little of Andrath's life was recorded in the annals of history, he was remembered for the ''A Call to Arms'' pamphlets found pinned to trees in Cormyr in the {{YearlinkName|430}}. Knight Dragonarl called his fellow able-bodied Cormyreans to pick up [[iron]] and [[shield]] in defense of their homes. The pamphlet called all willing men to be assembled by the old [[oak]]. Andrath Dragonarl and all those willing to join his cause were well aware of the death that awaited them. Nevertheless, they joined together as one Cormyr in spite of the kingdom's dark days.
