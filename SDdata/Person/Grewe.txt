'''Grewe''' was a male [[human]] and the king of [[Konigheim]] in the [[Utter East]] in the midâ€“7{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the [[648 DR|Year of the Dancing Daggers, 648 DR]], King Grewe was the first to discover the ancient [[bloodforge]]s of the Utter East. These ancient devices of war could mass-produce entire armies of [[basal golem|golems]], eliminating overnight the cost of mustering and maintaining armed forces. Within [[tenday]]s, Ffolk across all the Five Kingdoms had discovered bloodforges of their own, and immediately burst into the [[Bloodforge Wars]].
