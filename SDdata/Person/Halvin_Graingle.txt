'''Halvin Graingle''' was a member of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the [[Quivering Forest]] near [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]]. 

==History==
Under the orders of his masters, Halvin went to the Quivering Forest posing as a woodworker. His mission was to make a new bargain with the dark [[fey]] who had helped [[Cvaal Daoran]] to save [[Phlan]] from the [[shadovar]]s' ire a century before. Thus he started living in the [[Kabel's Hill]] community, searching for lore about the fey of the forest. In the end, Halvin went out to meet with the [[hag]] [[Jeny Greenteeth]], but the negotiation did not go well and she killed him.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|6}}
