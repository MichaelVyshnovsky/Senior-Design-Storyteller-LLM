        "mainbody": "'''Mrune Moontan''' was a [[half-elf]] [[sorceress]] and adventurer. The deliberate mispronunciation of her name as \"Moon Mountain\" gave the [[Moon Mountain Brewery]] its name.",
        "Abilities": "Mrune was an accomplished sorceress of great power and dabbled in brewing [[ale]].",
        "Activities": "She was known to cavort and dance under the light of the [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon]] with \"strange monstrous visitors\".",
        "History": "On her travels, Mrune met and fell in love with a [[halfling]] named [[Oblar Minstrelwish]] who, at the time, was a well-known adventurer from [[Secomber]]. They eventually married, and she and Oblar started a brewery using her recipe and method for making ale.  Oblar's friends and admirers from Secomber affectionately corrupted Mrune's name to \"Moon Mountain\" and it became the name of the brewery, and [[Moon Mountain Ale]] became her legacy. As of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the brewery was owned and operated by two intermarried families of halflings, the [[Minstrelwish]] and the [[Borulglar]]."
