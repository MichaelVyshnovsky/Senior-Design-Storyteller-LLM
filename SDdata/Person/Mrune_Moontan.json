        "mainbody": "Mrune Moontan was a half-elf sorceress and adventurer. The deliberate mispronunciation of her name as \"Moon Mountain\" gave the Moon Mountain Brewery its name.\nMrune was an accomplished sorceress of great power and dabbled in brewing ale.\nShe was known to cavort and dance under the light of the moon with \"strange monstrous visitors\".\nOn her travels, Mrune met and fell in love with a halfling named Oblar Minstrelwish who, at the time, was a well-known adventurer from Secomber. They eventually married, and she and Oblar started a brewery using her recipe and method for making ale.  Oblars friends and admirers from Secomber affectionately corrupted Mrunes name to \"Moon Mountain\" and it became the name of the brewery, and Moon Mountain Ale became her legacy. As of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the brewery was owned and operated by two intermarried families of halflings, the Minstrelwish and the Borulglar."
