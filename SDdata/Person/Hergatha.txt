Hergatha, commonly known as the Storm Maiden, was a young woman who led most of the Northlanders on the isle of Norland in the late 15 century DR. She believed herself to be the reincarnation of Viledel, an ancient Northlander warrior, although her belief was false.
Hergatha was blessed by two deities. The goddess Umberlee made it impossible for her to drown but also gave her a compulsion to drown living creatures. The god Tempus, meanwhile, made her a mighty warrior,  
Hergatha was born to a young woman on Ruathym. About to give birth, the woman sheltered under Yggdrasils Child in the forest. She carved her daughters name into the tree and asked the god of war Tempus to bless her child. The god answered her prayer but so did the sea goddess Umberlee, who struck down the woman with a lightning bolt and carried the child to the shore of Norland island in the Moonshae Isles. She was found by fishermen and raised by a childless couple.
Hergatha showed great martial prowess at an early age and by the late 1400s DR a large number of Northlanders swore fealty to her. By 1479 DR, she had begun a campaign to drive the firbolgs of the South Jotunhammer Mountains from their lands, allowing the Northlanders access to the entire island of Norland. 
Shortly afterward, she went mad with the power of Umberlee and led her followers in an effort to conquer the Sea of Swords. Battles on Norland resulted in the deaths of all male heirs of King Rault the Wise and weakened the Northlanders control over the northern Moonshae Isles. Hergatha was ultimately defeated at sea when her ship was sunk, although she was assumed to have survived as she could not drown.
