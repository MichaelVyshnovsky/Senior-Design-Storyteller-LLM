        "mainbody": "Hlaavin was the leader of the Unseen in Waterdeep in 1372.\nHlaavin was born in the illithid city of ChChitl in the Underdark, as one of the mind flayers experiments.\nIn 1349 DR, the ulitharid Thalynsar sent Hlaavin to Waterdeep as leader of a druuth, a band of doppelgangers sent by illithids to infiltrate enemy cities. Soon after, however, ChChitl suffered a crisis caused by the killing of the elder brain by a githyanki party in 1362 DR. Thalynsar and the mind flayers of ChChitl could pay little attention to Hlaavin and his subordinates.\nHowever, thanks to his half-illithid nature, a secret to all, Hlaavin managed to gather together the other doppelgangers and even recruit new members, founding the Unseen. Hlaavins plan was to subtly and slowly gain control of Waterdeep and afterward expand to all the Sword Coast.\nAt one point Hlaavin may have lived amongst the garbage in the Rat Hills. \nThe half-illithid part of Hlaavin surpassed the cowardly nature common to all doppelgangers.\nHlaavin usually used the guise of the Lord of Waterdeep Nindil Jalbuck but had more identities, such as Chievel, major-domo of the Kothont family villa and right-hand-man of Lord Kothont Lady Cyrtue, owner of the Hanging Lantern festhall and Thad Ruchel, rogue leader of the Luskan-based adventuring band Masks Conscripts."
