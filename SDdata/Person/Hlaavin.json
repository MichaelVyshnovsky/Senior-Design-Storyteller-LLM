        "mainbody": "'''Hlaavin''' was the leader of the [[Unseen]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372]].",
        "History": "Hlaavin was born in the [[illithid]] city of [[Ch'Chitl]] in the [[Underdark]], as one of the mind flayers' experiments.\n\nIn [[1349 DR]], the [[ulitharid]] [[Thalynsar]] sent Hlaavin to [[Waterdeep]] as leader of a ''[[druuth]]'', a band of [[doppelganger]]s sent by illithids to infiltrate enemy cities. Soon after, however, Ch'Chitl suffered a crisis caused by the killing of the [[elder brain]] by a [[githyanki]] party in [[1362 DR]].{{Ch'Chitl-event}} Thalynsar and the mind flayers of Ch'Chitl could pay little attention to Hlaavin and his subordinates.\n\nHowever, thanks to his half-illithid nature, a secret to all, Hlaavin managed to gather together the other doppelgangers and even recruit new members, founding the Unseen. Hlaavin's plan was to subtly and slowly gain control of Waterdeep and afterward expand to all the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nAt one point Hlaavin may have lived amongst the garbage in the [[Rat Hills]]. {{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}}",
        "Personality": "The half-illithid part of Hlaavin surpassed the cowardly nature common to all doppelgangers.",
        "Aliases": "Hlaavin usually used the guise of the [[Lord of Waterdeep]] [[Nindil Jalbuck]] but had more identities, such as '''Chievel''', major-domo of the [[Kothont]] family villa and right-hand-man of Lord Kothont; Lady '''Cyrtue''', owner of the [[Hanging Lantern]] festhall; and '''Thad Ruchel''', rogue leader of the [[Luskan]]-based adventuring band [[Mask's Conscripts]]."
