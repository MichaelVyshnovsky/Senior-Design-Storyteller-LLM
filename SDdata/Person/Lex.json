She was a bone-slender woman with a shock of close-cropped hair, purple like dead flowers; she carried a number of tomes, wands, and scrolls on her belt.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|215-217|22}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|254-258|27}} While fighting [[Marrec]]'s party, Lex was protected by a spell akin to ''[[shield]]'', and she employed a spell that threatened to hold [[Marrec]] and paralyzed [[Elowen]], most likely ''[[mass hold person]]'', but she was backstabbed by [[Fallon]] before she could finish off the ranger she enspelled.\n\nShe had been the one to pen her mistress' scroll of escape.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|260-262|28}}"
