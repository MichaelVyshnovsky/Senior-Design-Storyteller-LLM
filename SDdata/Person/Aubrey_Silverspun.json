        "mainbody": "'''Aubrey Silverspun''' was a member of the [[Swords of Leilon]], a group of [[adventurer]]s based in [[Leilon]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. After his death, Aubrey's [[ghost]] remained in Leilon, running [[Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Description": "Aubrey Silverspun was a bizarre [[Illuskan]] man.",
        "Activities": "As a member of the loosely organized Swords of Leilon, Aubrey Silverspun protected Leilon until its fall in [[1385 DR]].\n\nLater, Aubrey's ghost sold trinkets and [[magic item]]s in his shop. Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe only appeared for certain individuals.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century DR, Aubrey Silverspun was an adventurer in the region around Leilon. Together with [[Augusta Krul]] and [[Ogri Ninebeards]], the other two members of the Swords of Leilon, Aubrey protected Leilon before its fall. The [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] broke the magical wards of the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] and released all of the monsters within, who then rampaged through the village. The Swords battled to cover the townsfolk's escape. They died, becoming bound to Leilon's ruins as ghosts.\n\nBy the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild both Leilon and the High Tower of Thalivar. Aubrey and his companions kept a close eye on the town's reconstruction, hoping that the repaired tower would not cause another calamity. In Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe, he sold magic items to new adventurers so that they could protect Leilon in the future. The Swords of Leilon also helped defend Leilon during the Battle of Leilon, a three-way battle in which Leilon was besieged by both the [[Cult of Talos]] and the [[Cult of Myrkul]]."
