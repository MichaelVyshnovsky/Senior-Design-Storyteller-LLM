        "mainbody": "Szass Tam was a powerful lich and a member of the eight Zulkirs who ruled the country of Thay and, after the War of the Zulkirs, he reigned as the Regent of Thay. Szass Tams seat of power was the Citadel on the Thaymount.\nSzass Tam was thin and  with dark eyes, a wispy black beard, and thinning black hair. He wore a vermilion robe with voluminous sleeves trimmed with gems and gold. He was gaunt and pale, but only his withered hands and the hint of dry rot occasionally wafting from his person truly attested to his lichdom. Szass Tam implemented illusions and the preservation spell to maintain his human appearance. He often took on the appearance of a fine-featured sixty- or seventy-year-old scholarly man with deep black eyes.\nHe often had an ebony staff with him. During the Spellplague, Tams undead nature was apparent to every onlooker since the chaos rendered his magical powers close to useless, thus preventing the lich from altering his burned and ruined appearance.\nleft|thumb|Szass Tam and his undead sentry.|805x805px\nSzass Tam embraced the traditional habits of the Red Wizards. He was a talented manipulator and planner, working from the shadows through agents, servants, and a vast number of undead minions, including skeletons, zombies, juju zombies, ghouls, ghasts, wights, and vampires,\nThe lich kept his study always filled with lit candles. He liked to keep his home shrouded in the dim light of candles, which he preferred to daylight. Tam kept the curtains closed even during the day.\nAs for religion, Tam did not worship any one deity. As years passed, the lich found no drive to venerate any deity that promised him eternal life. Whatever deity received mortal Szass Tams worship, the undead wizard had no patron god. He showed respect to some gods, such as Cyric, but others were not worth attention in Tams eyes. Even the goddess of deceit Leira received no attention nor respect from him.\nAs a creature of undeath himself, he came to despise those life and stated that the living defiled the world.\nAfter achieving lichdom, Tam gained all abilities and immunities that came with the new existence. He was completely unaffected by cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting magics. Like all other undead, he was immune to diseases, poison, sleep, paralysis, could not be stunned, and could not be affected by death magic. Negative energy healed him and he possessed darkvision. The lichs touch could paralyze creatures, and Tam could cast spells that required a touch from as far as  away. He was always shrouded in a powerful aura of fear.\nAs a powerful necromancer and a lich who had centuries to collect powerful magics, Szass Tam had a vastly powerful arsenal of spells, both common and extremely rare. Some of the spells always available to Tam were circle, dazzle, preservation, fire lance, proof from teleportation, Beltyns burning blood, negate magical weapon, animate dread warrior, imbue undead with spell ability, Simbuls synostodweomer, flensing, unlife, mage tunnel, and spell-lash.\nApart from his impressive mastery of the Art, Tam wielded daggers, darts, and staves. He was knowledgeable on the topics of ancient and modern Thayan history, astrology, engineering, etiquette, heraldry, gem cutting, naval navigation, and herbalism.\nTam also spoke the Common, ancient Thorass, Abyssal, Draconic, Elven, Infernal, and Mulhorandi languages.\nDue to his power, age, and status, Tam had a vast vault of numerous powerful magic items. Some said that his collection was one of, if not the largest in Faerûn. Potions, scrolls, wands, staves (including a staff of power)\nA magical tome of knowledge—The Tome of Blasphemous Magic—was loaned to the Red Wizard of Daggerford, Arvik Zaltos, during the Second Sundering. A Harper hero, Artus Cimber, stole a magical journal with infinite pages from Szass Tams library at some point before 1362 DR.\nBefore claiming the Citadel, Tam had owned four sizable keeps, all located in Thay. The largest was his favorite home and stood between Amruthar and Eltabar. The keeps lands were filled with graveyards where his armies slept until summoned, while regular patrols of various undead creatures ensured Tam was uninterrupted in his plans and research. Underneath the Citadel lay the Paths of the Doomed, the labyrinthine cave system and powerfully enchanted dungeons lorded over by Tam. The tunnels had rich deposits of crimson gold and kings tears gems, while the dungeon hid elaborately secured chambers where Tam hid the most valuable magic items guarded by summoned elemental creatures, gem golems, and enslaved fiends.\nHe was considered an accomplished sage. Sometime before 1372 DR, Szass Tam authored a famous anatomical work known as the Aesthetics of Human Anatomy.\nTam was also a spell inventor. Most notably, he developed the spell animate dread warrior, a type of undead created by Tam. He used these dread warriors to unleash attacks on Rashemen. It was believed that Szass Tam also was the inventor of the mage tunnel spell however, in reality, the lich learned it from some mysterious source. Tam found a way to \"recycle\" leftovers from necromantic experiments. Discarded bodies, unusable for anything else, were transformed by the lich into bloodhulks. Another unholy creation of Tams necromancy was the Omen of Despair, a unique black unicorn that siphoned hope and joy from all living things around it.\nSzass Tam had a deal with Larloch and searched for ancient magic items and artifacts for him in exchange for some of Larlochs prized enchanted possessions. Both powerful artifacts, the Death Moon Orb and Thakorsils Seat, were gained by Tam from this agreement with Larloch.\nEven though Szass Tam had dozens of attendants over the years, one—Charmaine—had served the lich for several decades as of 1364 DR in exchange for food and a promise of immortality. Tam appreciated a loyal servant and anticipated making her his loyal servant forever. However, she died at the fangs of a fledgling vampire. Furious, the lich incinerated the vampire with a mere thought. It was too late to raise her as a vampire herself, and Szass Tam hated the idea of raising her as a mere zombie or a ghoul. In the end, he decided to let her rest in peace. Tams next chambermaid was Neera, who replaced Charmaine and was a much less liked and competent servant.\nDespite his desire for absolute rulership over Thay, Szass Tam took in apprentices whose number and names were kept a secret. Another apprentice of note was Frodyne, Tams favorite for her drive and immense talent. Not surprisingly, she was punished for her hubris and her masters betrayal. The last known apprentice was a fiercely loyal woman named Undumora who was appointed the governor of Emmech in the 15 century DR. After her death, Tam was \"wildly beyond rage\" that there was nothing left of her to be returned as an undead. Living Thayans speculated that Tam desired Undumora as some sort of consort.\nSzass Tam once showed interest in finding someone worthy of sharing his lichdom. One such individual was Thazienne Uskevren, whom Tam considered intriguing and felt something akin to attraction. However, Thazienne was morally opposed to slavery, while the lich firmly stated that it would always be part of Thay.\nThe lich had many enemies. The Zulkir of Alteration, Maligors plans to claim power over Thay through monetary means were thwarted by Szass Tams manipulations. If Maligor was ever to return, surviving the collapse of Thayvian gold mines or through undeath, as archmages were notoriously hard to kill, Tam would be Maligors main enemy and target of vengeance. People and defenders of Thays neighboring nations—Rashemen and Aglarond—were Tams enemies, as well as the pesky Harpers. Fellow Red Wizards and Zulkirs were not Tams allies either, always plotting and grasping for power.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, Tam was a high-ranking secret sponsor of Dennatons gladiatorial pits in Thay. During the same period of time, Vicross commanded a small team of Thayan Knights, Thayan Fighters, and Red Wizards in Tethyr. Secretly, Vicross was a wild mage, and an aberration in the eyes of the Zulkir. When her nature was revealed, Tam sought to end her life for concealing the wild magic gift.\nApart from making an enemy out of Leira,\nthumb|250px|Szass Tam, in his preserved human disguise, with the Death Moon Orb.\nSzass Tam was born in the . As Tam accumulated power in secrecy, he used the name of Tarloth Narmandur. As Tarloth, Tam sponsored adventuring companies to procure enchanted items for him, and once the bands brought \"enough\" magic, they were destroyed by the future lich before they could become dangerous or hold some things back.\nAt some point in his youth, Tam inherited his favorite polished, enchanted, several-hundred-years-old crystal ball that belonged to his mentor after the future lich killed him. Tam increased his arcane powers after wresting all sorts of arcane devices, elixirs, and books from his dead teacher. The teachers body was reanimated by Tam and kept within his lair, patrolling the Citadels halls as a simple skeleton. This was done not as an act of malice or proof of superiority but simple practicality. No body should go to waste, according to the lich. In the , he led a group of Red Wizards to slay \"the Vampire Zulkir\" Nyressa Flass, the Zulkir of Necromancy at the time. Afterward, Tam was named her successor, becoming the new Zulkir of Necromancy. \nBefore becoming a lich, one of his bitter rivals was a fellow Red Wizard, master of the school of evocation whom Szass Tam faced in a spell-slinging duel. The other Red Wizard was prepared to face Tams necromancy spells and was caught off-guard when the future lich flung twelve fireballs into his face using a necklace of fireballs. This prompted Tams opponent to waste most of his spells in deflecting and defending against the infernal onslaught, while Szass Tam had his entire repertoire of memorized spells at his disposal. Needless to say, the future undead emerged victorious.\nIn the , Szass Tam became a lich after leading an unsuccessful invasion of Rashemen.\nIn the , Szass Tam joined the newly elected Zulkir of Invocation, Narvonna Kren, and the Zulkir of Illusion Nymor Thrul, to invade the nation of Aglarond. The trio developed an elaborate plan a feint attack on the Watchwall using Tams zombies allowing the other two zulkirs to attack the nation from the flank, at the forest of Yuirwood. The initial attack was successful, and Tams forces performed their part. However, the mortal troops of Narvonnas and Nymors were disorganized and cared more about looting and pillaging rather than following the battle plan. This cost the zulkirs the element of surprise, and the invasion was a failure. Tam blamed Zulkir of Illusion, Nymor Thrul, for the fiasco, and after a heated argument, the lich killed Nymor with the suffocate spell.\nSome time in the late 12 or early 13 century DR, Szass Tam became involved in the Harpstar Wars when he met the corrupt and ambitious Harper Rundorl Moonsklan. With Rundorl desiring to be the power behind every throne in the North and Szass scheming to destroy his rivals in Thay, the two made a dark deal Szass would funnel Rundorl information on his rivals and Rundorl would gain prestige by sending Harpers to win victories over them. To justify this focus on Thay, Rundorl spread the story of \"the spell of Undeath\". According to information hed discovered, the Red Wizards were developing a new spell capable of instantly turning the populations of whole cities into undead slaves in order to quickly produce armies and threaten and enslave all of Faerûn. The plan went perfectly and Rundorl sent his fellows against those Red Wizards and even zulkirs whom he claimed had involvement in \"the spell of Undeath\". They killed many and both he and Tam advanced in power. Eventually, though, Red Wizards were being replaced but not weakened overall and had begun to reach beyond Thay to retaliate against the Harpers. Worse, Rundorl realized more Harpers were dying than Thayans and his exhausted men were being assassinated and reanimated as unique undead themselves, and he rightly suspected that Tam had betrayed him. He broke off the alliance, then made a worse deal with another lich, Thavverdasz, to deal with his undead Harper problem. Thavverdasz took control of Tams undead Harpers and Rundorl alike and got into a war with the Cult of the Dragon.\nMeanwhile, Szass Tam was annoyed at how easily hed lost his undead to the other lich, but bided his time until the Cult of the Dragon was almost on Thavverdaszs lair in the Vast Swamp. Then, in the , Szass Tam struck, surprising Thavverdasz in his lair. The two fought a great spell battle, but both had cunning magical ruses. Rather than appear in person, Szass sent a magical image of himself that could cast spells and had a material form, while he remained safely in Thay, unhurt and undistracted, so Thavverdaszs spells merely damaged his own lair. However, Thavverdaszs lairs defenses redirected all Szass Tams magical assaults into the Vast Swamp against Harpers and Dragon Cultists. Neither could harm the other, until Thavverdasz utilized some potent magical item to obliterate Szass Tams image. It was powerful enough to even affect him back in far-off Thay—the Zulkir of Necromancy lost his senses for many years, defeated again by the superior lich. (Worse still, Elminster had popped in, surprised and destroyed Thavverdasz in his moment of victory.)\nHowever, Szass Tam would go on to do exactly what the Harpers had feared, as in time he acquired or developed the spell known as beckoning death...\nIn the , Tam developed his animate dread warrior spell, and began using it to amass an army.\nTam became a prominent and widely known power in the mid–14 century DR after he and three other Red Wizards plotted to overthrow the governments of the cities on the Sea of Fallen Stars. The lich and his Red Wizards summoned an army of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire efreeti and salamanders. The elementals were promised a payment, namely a permanent magical gate between Toril and the Elemental Plane of Fire, a promise the zulkirs never intended to honor. When the deception was revealed, Red Wizards failed to banish salamanders, leading to the Salamander War of the . Tam sent his undead forces to aid the three wizards against the salamanders, but the war still lasted for almost a year.\nIn the , Tam and several fellow Red Wizards approached the Grand Army of the Tuigan, following the breaching of the Dragonwall. Bewildered Tuigans informed the Zulkirs that the leaders of the recent battles were Yamun Khahan, Illustrious Emperor of All Peoples, and General Chanar. With a demonstration of Thayan powers, Tam transported both Yamun Khahan and Chanar using his magic to the meeting, leaving the Tuigan leaders no say in the matter. The lich showed Yamun Khahan a vision of the Grand Army clashing with Thayan forces and their defeat under the onslaught of Red Wizards magic. To avoid the war, Tam cemented an alliance between Thay and the Tuigans through flattery, intimidation, and demonstration of his strategic leadership. The horde was rerouted towards the lichs much-hated enemies in Rashemen. Together, two armies attacked Tuigans from the east and Thayan forces from the south. Tam loaned Yamun Khahan the Red Wizards that arrived with him to the negotiations to lead the attack on Rashemen. The Grand Army of the Tuigan ravaged Rashemen, and as payment for the alliance, Tam used Thayan magic to part the Lake of Tears,The novels describe this as parting the waters of the Lake, while the The Grand History of the Realms simply states Szass Tam opened a portal for the Tuigans. allowing the horde to move west across Faerûn, until stopped by a united army led by King Azoun Obarskyr IV in the .\nAt some point before the confrontation with his nemesis Maligor, Tam had an apprentice named Frodyne. She attempted to claim a powerful magic item from a temple of Leira in Delhumide, despite the lichs claim to the artifact. When Tam arrived at the site to personally claim the crown of Leira, he realized that his favorite apprentice Frodyne was the first to descend into the temples vaults. It was revealed that the treasure was a trap laid by the goddess Leira for a lich who refused to show her respect as a goddess deserved. The crown granted mortals who wore it eternal life, but if worn by the undead, it became a source of eternal pain and torment. Szass Tam allowed Frodyne to be captured by the temples monstrous guardian and granted her eternal life as punishment for her insolence. Frodyne was left in the temple only to be killed by the guardian over and over again, endlessly, until the end of time.\nBy the , Tams arch-rival among the Zulkirs was Maligor, the Zulkir of Alteration. Maligors personal army was comparable to Tams, so instead of war, Maligor hatched a plan to take over the Thayvian gold mines and, through it, the production of gold in the country. Willeth Lionson, the tharchion of Thaymount, was slain and replaced by Maligors shapeshifting commander, the spirit naga Asp. The Zulkirs plan to outsmart Tam was foiled with the aid of the lichs unwilling allies the Harper agent and druid Galvin, a politician from Aglarond named Brenna Graycloak, and the centaur Wynter. The trio was sent to Thay to investigate Maligors activities, suspecting a looming war against Aglarond. Seeing an opportunity, Tam put the Harpers in charge of his undead army that clashed with Maligors darkenbeast and gnoll forces. The confrontation resulted in the collapse of the Thayvian gold mines, with Maligor seemingly swallowed by the tunnels. However, the Harpers made themselves an enemy when they intentionally decimated Tams army in the process.\nIn Marpenoth of the ,The Spellbound book does not specify when these events take place but states that the Throne of Deceit precedes The Runes of Chaos adventure that involved Tams attempt to bind Eltab to his will. To match with the timeline established in The Grand History of the Realms, this article uses 1367 DR as the adventures date. Szass Tam manipulated a group of adventurers into delivering a box filled with plans for the Thayan invasion of Rashemen. Tam sent an anonymous warning to the Simbul, the ruler of Aglarond, leading to the box falling into her hands and the adventurers being tried as Thayan agents. The Simbul, ever-prepared, had spies watching the adventurers and knew of their innocence. She tasked them with traveling to Rashemen, warn the huhrong, and aid in defending the country from Thay. Tam used the invasion to discredit his main opponents among the zulkirs Lauzoril, Aznar Thrul , and Nevron. This stunt drew some zulkirs to support Tam, namely Mythrellan, making him a major power in the Thayan government.\nthumb|370px|The demon lord Eltab, trapped by Tam on Thakorsils Seat.\nThe same year, a powerful earthquake shook Thay, destroying a big part of Eltabbar. The disaster was caused by Szass Tam releasing the demon lord Eltab, who had been imprisoned under the city for centuries since the early days of Thay. The group was evidently successful as Eltab slithered out of Tams clutches and hid underneath Thaymout, within its demoncyst. Tam used magic to trap the demon lord within the demoncyst but the spell had a tiny flaw the tanarri would exploit with time.\nAnother attack on Aglarond was helmed by Tam in the winter of . The lich unleashed an army of undead that marched across the Umber Marshes. Waves of Tams undead crashed against the Watchwall but ultimately failed to breach it.\nIn the , he was aided by Thazienne Uskevren of Sembia against an assassination attempt by Naglatha, Thays Spymaster. Thazienne was forced by Naglatha to retrieve Tams hidden scrolls and unwittingly unleashed Eltab and his minions on Thaymount.\nthumb|center|827px|Szass Tam versus the defenders of Rashemen.\nthumb|left|350px|Szass Tam has the worst party horn.\nAccording to history books a century later, and as Xenk Yendar would recall, in the mid-1370s DR, Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of the Thaymount tharch, Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on the eve of the summer solstice. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.Honor Among Thieves only says \"the capital\" of Thay, which at the time should be Eltabbar. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tams tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead.Honor Among Thieves mentions only the eve of the solstice due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god Amaunator has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass interrupted Zulkir Dmitra Flass as she addressed the crowd and produced a red horn from under his robes. With it, he cast the beckoning death, thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and following conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain by Red Wizards in his service, among them Sofina.It is difficult to reconcile Xenks account and the scenes in Honor Among Thieves with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tams betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in The Crimson Gold in 1373 DR the meeting of the Council of Zulkirs in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tams takeover of Thay in Unclean in 1375 DR and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenks childhood memories, its presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization.\nIn fact, in the , Tam orchestrated the murders of the Zulkirs Druxus Rhym and Aznar Thrul and betrayed a Thayan army, under the command of tharchions Azhir Kren and Homen Odesseiron, to the Rashemi to create a climate of fear within the Thayan population. He hindered the proper investigation of the murders and solved these issues by himself. He thus tried to convince the nobles, legions, and common people that he was the only one who could deal with these problems, in order to get himself elected supreme ruler of Thay. When Zulkir Dmitra Flass rallied other Zulkirs originally loyal to him to stand against his aspirations, Tam decided to achieve rulership by force and declared war on all opposing Zulkirs. When Dmitras council achieved a great victory against his undead army at the Keep of Thazar, Tam called upon the united armies of Gauros and Surthay to march south toward the great city of Bezantur.\nBy the , Szass Tam had solidified his seat of power in the Citadel at Thaymount by evicting his enemies from their estates on the plateau. Some of the Zulkirs switched sides during the war and ended up as Tams allies. One of them was the diviner Yaphyll. However, after realizing that Thay under the lichs reign would be a nation of undead, she decided to switch sides again in favor of the council of Zulkirs. As a result, Tam took her prisoner in the , binding her with the Death Moon Orb and Thakorsils Seat, powerful artifacts of domination. He forced Yaphyll to perform the most powerful divination known to her order, no matter the consequences to her own well-being, and to tell him how to arrange for a decisive victory over the other Zulkirs. She performed the task and told Tam to lay a trap at the Keep of Sorrows. Then she left him with another cryptic vision.\nAt the end of the vision, Yaphyll was surrounded by a blue flame and broke free of Szass Tams power. The lich killed her with his poisonous touch, while trying to regain control over the diviner. Later, it became apparent that Yaphyll saw what became known as the Spellplague, the blue flames being a result of the event. As Yaphyll predicted, the fight at the Keep of Sorrows turned in Tams favor. With the help of the Death Moon Orb, he tried to coerce his former ally Dmitra Flass into fighting for his side. But then the Spellplague hit. The Death Moon Orb exploded in Tams hand, freeing Dmitra of its power. The lich was hit by a wave of azure fire, rendering his magic close to useless and burning the illusory flesh off his face and hands. The lich fled from the scene with the help of his atropal ally Xingax.\nBy revealing to Malark Springhill, a monk of the Order of the Long Death, why he killed Druxus Rhym, the lich convinced the spymaster to switch sides and work for him and his greater cause henceforth. In order to learn more about the ways of magic in the time of the Spellplague, Tam summoned Bane, the Lord of Tyranny, by sacrificing the enthralled tharchion Pyras Autorian in the ritual. Bane made a bargain with the lich he would reveal to Tam his knowledge about the chaotic magic, grant the lich the ability to raise more dead for his cause, and augment the lichs powers. Szass Tam, in turn, agreed to surrender his soul after 1,000 years had passed when his quest of conquering Thay was completed. Tam knew that the mystical strength lent to him by Bane would gradually fade, so he chose to exploit it immediately. \nWhen it came to another fight at the Keep of Sorrows, Szass Tam summoned a dream vestige to turn the tide in his favor. He succeeded in beating the legions of the Zulkirs, chasing them all the way to Bezantur. His undead legions and loyal priests of Bane further forced the Zulkirs to leave the town aboard vessels. Tam summoned the bodies of drowned men and undead aquatic beasts for a final and lethal victory over the Zulkirs. Accompanied by a fleet of warships made from darkness, he followed the fleeing Zulkirs, entangling them in a marine war. His enemies and the Zulkir of Conjuration Nevrons conjured denizens of the infernal oceans proved quite adept at sea fighting, thus beating back his undead minions. Tam conjured the dream vestige again, finally exhausting his magical powers bestowed by Bane. When Bareris defeated the dream vestige, and the Zulkirs forces beat Szass Tams minions, the lich and Malark Springhill withdrew to the Thaymount, the lich being content with his conquered lands. \nTam didnt bother chasing the remaining Zulkirs anymore, leaving Alaor and the Wizards Reach to them, as he did not fear any retribution by the Zulkirs depleted forces. He revealed to Malark that he found a book once in the possession of Fastrin the Delver.\nBy the , Thay was a country under Tams absolute control. The lich regent set his eye on the fortress of Emmech in the much-hated nation of Aglarond. Tams attack was swift and relentless. The first wave was made up of undead that attacked from the Shyvar Pass as Red Wizards teleported angry monsters straight onto Aglarondan troops to sow chaos. Tams living soldiers marched behind golems, yet the attack was repealed before the troops reached the Tannath Mountains, which was exactly what the Thayan strategists planned for. As the defenders were distracted, a small strike force infiltrated Emmech and turned down the fortresss defensive magics and wards, exposing it to Red Wizards teleportation spells that brought in hundreds of less powerful Red Wizards. Battles on the streets lasted for a month, fueled by barges full of undead soldiers shipped down River Umber from Nethentir and Nethjet, until all resistance quelled. Thay exterminated all civilians and Aglarondan soldiers. However, the conquest came at a price – lives of thousands of lesser Red Wizards under the zulkirates command, several thousand living Thayan soldiers, and tens of thousands of undead, all were lost in this short war. This hefty price curbed Szass Tams ambitions for decades, forcing him to focus on recovering his military numbers. This win also convinced Tam that undead legions were the best military force one could have. The \"lean years\" of weakened Thay caused the living Thayans to lose the last vestiges of respect for Tam as a leader, and fear was the only thing that kept them in check.\nTam appointed a personally-loyal apprentice, governor Undumora, who began to transform Emmech into a formidable Thayan fortress with a sizable garrison of undead forces. In spring of the , Undumora was disintegrated by a guerrilla spell attack by the Simbarch Council of Aglarond. The attacks goal was to disrupt and delay any offensive plans Thay mightve had against Aglarond. Tam was enraged at the loss. The keep soon was renamed to Undumor in her memory.\nIn the , Tam, as the absolute ruler of Thay, attempted to ascend to godhood and unmake the world with the use of the Dread Rings his minions constructed in Thay. Even though the plan failed in 1478 DR, with the help of several zulkirs who died in the process and a group of heroes, the lich was adamant in expanding the borders of Thay to attempt the ritual once again as the Dread Rings of Thay were unusable.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Tam had reestablished the zulkirate by elevating powerful arcanists loyal to his rule. Tharchions and autharchs were allowed to run the territories of Thay under his control. The main army of Thay and Szass Tam became known as the Dread Legions, a horde of undead, orcs, and gnolls, as well as other monsters, all serving mainly as the defensive force of Thay.\nAt some point, however, the Harpers seem to have acquired or stolen Szass Tams red horn, perhaps preventing him from casting the beckoning death. They stored it within the vault of Korinns Keep, far from the lichs reach.From Honor Among Thieves, it is unknown how the horn managed to pass from Szass Tams possession and into the Harpers, and when this occurred. Most likely, they stole it to prevent him using it again. While speculative, the event is included here for context.\nFinally, in the mid-1490s DR, Szass Tams apprentice Sofina allied with the confidence trickster Forge Fitzwilliam and, in disguise, hired his partner the ex-Harper turned thief Edgin Darvis to steal the treasures of Korinns Keep. They, together with Holga Kilgore and Simon Aumar, infiltrated the vault and Sofina claimed back the red horn of Szass Tams beckoning death, betrayed the thieves, and escaped with her prize.\nHowever, Szass Tam did not merely want his horn back, but instead set Sofina a greater task. From the shadows of her office in Castle Never, Szass sent whispering images of himself to communicate with her, giving counsel and encouragement. In time, Sofina used the red horn and cast the beckoning death over the Neverwinter arena to turn its people into undead. However, the plan was a failure. The arena was emptied as citizenry was distracted by Forge Fitzwilliams wealth being dispensed over the streets of Neverwinter. Furious over the spells failure, Sofina dropped her mortal disguise and engaged in a spell-battle with Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, Simon Aumar, and Doric, but was defeated and incapacitated via an antimagic cuff.\n* It was rumored that Szass Tam was the original creator of boneclaws on Toril. Stories said these monstrous undead beings were used to protect Thayan enclaves across Faerûn."
