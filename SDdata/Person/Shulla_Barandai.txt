Shulla Barandai was a retired adventurer who worked at the Dryads Dreams of Mosstone in Tethyr.
Shulla had a slender body, the product of her adventuring career and acrobatic talents. She was said to be able to avoid a volley of elven arrows unscathed.
Shulla Barandai was one of the female escorts who worked at Dryads Dreams in the late mid-to-late 14 century DR after retiring from adventuring, along with several men and women who offered their services and companionship at the only festhall in Mosstone.
