        "mainbody": "estur Laklantur was the Royal Cook of the Low Kitchen in Castle Obarskyr, Suzail, during the late 15 century DR.\nHis backside was generously ample.\nThe Low Kitchen had at one point, a cream sauce with mushroom which smelled of nutmeg and lion meat which had been spit-seared and cut thickly, likely made under his supervision. It took him several hours to make a glazed manymeats pudding, and his sauce was lumpy, strongly implying those may have been the feats testing his abilities as a cook.\nHe was the Royal Cook of the Low Kitchen in Castle Obarskyr.\nNestur Laklantur was working in the Low Kitchen one day in , when the fugitives Storm Silverhand and Elminster Aumar accidentally fell into it, slipped all through the table, and bounced off his backside, pushing him into a pudding and ruining his cooking. He turned around with a ladle, against which Storms sword bounced, saving his life, and unleashing a blast of wild magic that converted the ceiling into a solid slab of sapphire. The slab shattered and fell, stunning everyone in the room."
