        "Possessions": "''[[Elena's pewter locket]]'' was a delicate magical amulet that she gifted to her beloved at some point before their deaths. The item possessed enchantment that increased the wearer's wisdom and intelligence.",

        "History": "Along with countless souls, Elena perished in the [[Weeping War]], ''circa'' [[714 DR]].\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Elena encountered the adventurers from [[Phlan]] seeking to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]] plan of corrupting the elven city's ''[[mythal]]''. She let them to [[Turgild's Square]] and asked for their aid in returning her favorite magic fountains from the lost days of the city's glory, back to function. The magical mechanism that powered the fountains was in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]' [[Deep Halls]] and guarded by a powerful [[dwarven statue golem]] called the [[Lifespring Guardian]].\n\nWith Elena's cryptic advice, the adventurers found her beloved's final resting place, disturbed and defiled. They restored dignity to Garras' dead body, receiving his ghost's gratitude. They did the same to Elena's defiled tomb in the Deep Halls. Both restless spirits, Elena and Garras lent their strength to the battle with the Guardian. Subsequently, the heroes defeated the [[golem]], freeing Elena and her lover from their ghostly existence."
