Flamdar was an adventurer of the Bloodshields Band in the late 15 century DR.
He carried peace-strings for his weapon.
He was a veteran adventurer.
The Bloodshields Band numbered six, including him, Rornagar Breakblade, Gaerond, Malkym and Lylar.
Flamdar was part of the Bloodshields Band when it ventured into Shadowdale in , on commission from a rich Sembian who had paid a large amount upfront, looking for Elminster Aumar, the ancient archmage. They came first upon the Old Skull Inn, where Gaerond commissioned the youngster Thal, actually a doppelganger, to lead him to Elminster. Thal took them to a cave, where they met a doppelganger pretending to be Elminster when they revealed they actually intended to decapitate Elminster and carry his head as a trophy to Sembia, a number of hidden doppelgangers fired a volley of crossbows into the band, slaying them almost on the spot.
