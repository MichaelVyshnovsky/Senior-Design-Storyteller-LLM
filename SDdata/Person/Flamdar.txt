'''Flamdar''' was an adventurer of the [[Bloodshields Band]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He carried peace-strings for his weapon.

==Activities==
He was a veteran adventurer.

==Relationships==
The [[Bloodshields Band]] numbered six, including him, [[Rornagar Breakblade]], [[Gaerond]], [[Malkym]] and [[Lylar]].

==History==
Flamdar was part of the Bloodshields Band when it ventured into [[Shadowdale]] in {{yearlink|1479}}, on commission from a rich [[Sembia]]n who had paid a large amount upfront, looking for [[Elminster Aumar]], the ancient archmage. They came first upon the [[Old Skull Inn]], where Gaerond commissioned the youngster [[Thal]], actually a [[doppelganger]], to lead him to Elminster. Thal took them to a cave, where they met a doppelganger pretending to be Elminster; when they revealed they actually intended to decapitate Elminster and carry his head as a trophy to Sembia, a number of hidden doppelgangers fired a volley of [[crossbow]]s into the band, slaying them almost on the spot.
