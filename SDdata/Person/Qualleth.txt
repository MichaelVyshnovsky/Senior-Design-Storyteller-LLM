'''Qualleth''' was a red-haired [[ranger]] in [[Nesmé]] in [[1484 DR]].
  
==History==
Just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Qualleth was appointed leader of the town's rangers in preparation for the imminent [[troll]] attack. He was greatly depressed by the [[Darkening]] and believed that only a miracle could save his hometown.
