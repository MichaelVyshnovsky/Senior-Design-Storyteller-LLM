'''Ozomar Do'Urden''', formerly '''Ozomar Druu'giir''', was the house wizard of [[House Do'Urden]].

==History==
Ozomar was formerly a member of [[House Druu'giir]]. He attended [[Sorcere]], the drow academy of magic, and was a "promising graduate". After the death of his rival (and the Do'Urden house wizard) [[Nalfein Do'Urden]], Ozomar happily defected to House Do'Urden to serve as house wizard, presumably until its destruction in [[1339 DR]].
