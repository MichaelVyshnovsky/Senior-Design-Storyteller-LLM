        "mainbody": "ukan was an illusionist wizard in the River District of Neverwinter.\nBefore the Spellplague of 1385 DR, Lukan was a member of the Many-Starred Cloak in Neverwinter. When the Spellplague hit, he was pulled into the Far Realm along with many of his fellow wizards. The wizard Gyrion took charge and tried to helped them survive until they could escape. The time spent in the Far Realm badly damaged Lukans mind, reducing him to a cowardly half-wit who had difficulty properly discerning reality from illusion.\nEventually, Lukan and three other wizards (Kabal, Nostura, and Gyrion) managed to escape the Far Realm and return to Neverwinter. Gyrion was angered by what he saw as the illegitimate rule of Dagult Neverember, and believed that as the last survivors of the Many-Starred Cloak it was their duty to rule Neverwinter. The four formed the Cloaked Ascendancy, and Gyrion used a replica of the Crown of Neverwinter to make himself appear as though he was the true heir of Nasher Alagondar. Secretly, however, he was planning a ritual that would open a gateway to the Far Realm within the city.\nWhile the other three members worked in Neverwinters River District to enact their ritual, Lukan was commanded to secretly create a fourth ritual site on the beach just outside the city walls, masking it with illusions as a backup in case their efforts in the River District failed. When his ritual site was discovered, the Neverwinter Guard attacked and clashed with the Cloaked Ascendancys Nasher allies. Lukan became distraught, panicking at the sight of so much blood and violence. When confronted by the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge, he told them that Gyrion insisted his rituals would save Neverwinter and that he never wanted to hurt anyone, begging them to stop the bloodshed.\nWhile the heroes slew his three compatriots, Lukan fled into one of the crypts below Neverwinters River District. There he found a stone door covered with \"pretty symbols\" (warding runes) and opened it, unleashing \"scary shadows\" (wraiths) upon the surface and causing a shadowy tower out of sync with the Prime Material Plane to appear in the sky. Kavatos Stormeye swiftly apprehended and imprisoned him for his actions."
