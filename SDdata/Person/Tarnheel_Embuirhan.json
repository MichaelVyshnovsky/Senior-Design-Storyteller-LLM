        "History": "Tarnheel was intrigued when the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'' of Captain [[Deudermont]] arrived in Mintarn in search of information about the mythical isle of [[Caerwich]] because he knew that [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was onboard. Drizzt was considered by many the best swordsman in the Realms and Tarnheel wanted this title. He thought this was the perfect occasion to decide the matter.\n\nThus Tarnheel sent his ambassador, [[Dunkin Tallmast]], offering goods and information in exchange for a duel between Tarnheel and Drizzt. Drizzt accepted the offer and confronted Tarnheel in a secret fight. When [[Catti-brie]] asked Drizzt about the outcome, he remained evasive. However, [[Robillard]] and [[Harkle Harpell]] used magic to watch the battle and assured Catti-brie that Drizzt won."
