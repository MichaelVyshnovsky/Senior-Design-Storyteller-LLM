        "Description": "Unlike most gnolls, Bort was neither chaotic nor [[evil]], but was instead [[lawful]] and [[neutral]]ly aligned. His adventuring party consisted of several of the goodly races, from [[halfling]]s to [[human]]s. The barbarian fought with a [[halberd]], and wore [[leather armor]]. He also carried a ''[[potion of healing]]''.",
        "History": "Bort and his party were taken from a \"shabby saloon\" to the [[Black Pits]]. They were killed by the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits]] and their party in the Black Pits arena."
