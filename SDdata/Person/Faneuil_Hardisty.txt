Captain
Baron Faneuil Hardisty was a warrior of Tethyr who attempted to bring an end to the anarchy within the region by any means available to him.
Baron Hardisty was handsome, with brown eyes and square-cut, graying hair. He kept his face clean-shaven.
Along with Zaranda Star, Faneuil was a captain in King Azouns crusade against the Tuigan Horde. They met again later when he became the most prominent member of the Council of Lords. Faneuil sought to restore the order within Tethyr by placing himself on the nations throne. As it turned out, he was being used as a pawn by a creature known as the deepspawn. Allied with the Lords Council and the bureaucracies of Zazesspur, Faneuil crowned himself king and became prey for the deepspawn.
