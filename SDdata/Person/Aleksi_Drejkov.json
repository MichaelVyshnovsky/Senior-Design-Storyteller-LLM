        "Personality": "Aleksi saw his allegiance to the Howling Hatred only as another method by which he could damage his rivals.",
        "History": "Aleksi's family once ruled a great trading empire, but he had no ability to rule it, and soon his rivals outmaneuvered and betrayed him. So Aleksi joined the Cult of the Howling Hatred and became leader of a cell in the city.\n\nIn 1491 DR, after many schemes had been ruined, the high leaders of the cult decided to wipe out the Drejkov's cell and sent a cadre of assassins led by [[Little Wing]] to silence them. After killing Drejkov's steward, [[Niko Sevek]], the cultist assassins burned Dreikov's mansion. Aleksi managed to escape in time, but was confronted by an adventuring party who'd been falsely accused of one of the cultists's assassinations. He was sniped at by the assassins."
