As his name implied, he typically walked around without any footwear.The color of Barefoot Holtmans beard is only apparent on the cover of the book.\nHoltman was aligned towards good and held a strong conviction to only fight those who were aligned towards evil.\nA quarterstaff was carried by Holtman wherever he went.\nWhen King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth and treasure. During their journey to claim the throne, the would-be heirs of King Mertwig met Barefoot Holtman and hired him for 40 gold pieces to join them on their adventure."
