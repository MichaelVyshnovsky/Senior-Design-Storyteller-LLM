Even though his power was limited he still commanded the respect of most Ffolk and Northlanders in the isles and hoped to reassert his authority over the entire archipelago.Shawn Merwin\"Backdrop  Moonshae Isles\" Dungeon  #196. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, November, 2011. \nIn 1489 DR he hoped to foster an alliance with the dwarven clans of the Fairheight Mountains, but was frequently rejected. Around this time he also sought to reclaim the ruins of the small Ffolk city Caer Corwell and rebuild it as an embassy to the kingdom of Sarifal, whose territory the city was then under, but struggled to obtain permission from their ruler Lady Ordalf.\nDerids youngest son, Owaren, was kidnapped by Lady Erliza Daressin and taken to Snowdown as a hostage."
