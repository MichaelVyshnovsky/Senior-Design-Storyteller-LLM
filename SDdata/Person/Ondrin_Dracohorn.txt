'''Ondrin Dracohorn''' was a member of the [[Dracohorn]] noble house of [[Cormyr]].

==Appearance==
Ondrin was short with ordinary looks and pale blue eyes. He always dressed in current fashions, and possessed a large metal brooch with a two-headed serpent and three swords.

==Background==
Ondrin rose to prominence by buying up property in Cormyr using the money from his shipping business based in [[Marsember]] and [[Saerloon]]. There were rumors that Ondrin partook in smuggling, piracy and slaving to make a bigger profit. Ondrin was known for not being able to keep his mouth shut.

In [[1369 DR]], during the [[abraxus affair]], Ondrin met secretly with High Wizard [[Vangerdahast]] to discuss his proposal to transfer the power of Cormyr to a council of noble houses, making Vangerdahast into a regent, via a voting system.
