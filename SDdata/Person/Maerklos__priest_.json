        "Personality": "He was a man of ferocious nature.",
        "History": "Considered to be the first and the greatest of the Storm Lord's warrior-priests, Maerklos was renowned for summoning storms, obliterating whole cities, and looting their wealth, all in devotion to his god.\n\nBut one of his greatest acts was creation—that of the ''[[Sword of Storms]]'', an [[artifact]] of great destructive power. Maerklos worked with over a dozen [[wizard]]s in its forging and [[item enchantment|enchanting]]. The sword was later lost, long before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], but thought to be somewhere in [[Alaghôn]], [[Turmish]]."
