        "mainbody": "amara Stonehill was the daughter of Toblen and Trilena Stonehill, the proprietors of the Stonehill Inn in Phandalin during the late 15 century DR. \nTamara was precocious and perceptive. She talked freely, but only if she was not engrossed in some activity.\nOnce each tenday, Tamara accompanied her mother to the Shrine of Luck to pray to Tymora. She was well versed in the traditions of the shrine, and would offer her help if needed to Sister Garaele.\nIn addition to her parents, Tamara had a brother named Pip.\nIn 1491 DR, when Tamara was ten years old, she and her mother witnessed a trio of goblins cause the Shrine of Luck to collapse. Tamara helped clean up the rubble by searching for still-usable pieces of the structure, and by herself managed to surmise that the collapse had been caused by the removal of the central stone in the structures archway."
