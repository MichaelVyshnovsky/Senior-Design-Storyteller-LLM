        "mainbody": "'''Delcan''' was a laborer and a delivery man of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette'' in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|''I keep telling you animals. If you want to buy a gazette, talk to the loud little shits screaming headlines. I deliver the papers. I do NOT sell them.''|Delcan}}",
        "Description": "Delcan was a pale-skinned [[human]] man with blue eyes and shaved head. He wore simple garb of a wraparound tunic, brown pants, and a hat.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Delcan was employed by Baldur's Mouth and could be found outside the [[broadsheet]] publisher's office picking up deliveries. The man had a foul attitude thanks to customers' incessant requests to purchase the gazette. His temper often boiled over as he preemptively shouted at folk that he did not sell the [[broadsheet]]s."
