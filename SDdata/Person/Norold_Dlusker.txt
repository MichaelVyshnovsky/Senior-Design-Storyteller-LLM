Lord Norold Dlusker was a patriar that lived in Baldurs Gate in the 15 century DR.
Norold was the patriarch of the disgraced Dlusker family.
This lord made his income from animal products. Specifically, his income came from a textile mill in the Lower City, slaughterhouses in the Outer City, and sheepfolds outside of Baldurs Gate. He sold his wares in the Wide, close by the Beloved Ranger statue.
Norold had both an older and younger sister. His older sister contracted mummy rot and passed away, and his younger sister, Guinever, was happily married to a young noble of the Caldwell family. This left Norold without an heir.
Dlusker had relations with the patriars of the Gate, as well as both the Flaming Fist and the Guild. The leader of the Guild, Nine-Fingers, under the name "Lady Keene", had been paying his stall fees for almost 4 years. Dlusker would, if necessary, lie about her identity and claim she was his accountant.
In the 15 century DR, Norold and his family supported Duke Valarken prior to Valarkens failed coup. This caused him to become disgraced. His older sister mysteriously passed away, and her husband took most of Norolds wealth to Waterdeep, leaving him poor and in severe debt. In 1482 DR, Dlusker was investigated by Duke Torlin Silvershield for his potential links with the Guild.
