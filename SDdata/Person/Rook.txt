Rook was an allegedly female drow revenant who lived in Araumycos. She was one of the fabled Morndin of Clan Ironstar. Rook wasnt her true name, but a nickname Daffyd gave to her since he never asked her true name.
Rook was a thin drow with an odd body and white hair. Her hands only had three fingers who looked like hooks.
She had the ability to temporarily kill the fungi of Araumycos.
Rook was originally one of the dwarves of Delzoun. When she was killed, her bones were scattered by orcs around Araumycos as a final offense to the dwarves. She was later revived as a drow revenant and her task was to recover her bones and ask for adventurers exploring Araumycos to give her bones a proper dwarven burial.
