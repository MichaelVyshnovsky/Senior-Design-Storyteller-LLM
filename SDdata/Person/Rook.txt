'''''Rook''''' was an allegedly female [[drow]] [[revenant]] who lived in [[Araumycos]]. She was one of the fabled [[Morndin]] of [[Clan Ironstar]]. ''Rook'' wasn't her true name, but a nickname [[Daffyd]] gave to her since he never asked her true name.

==Description==
''Rook'' was a thin drow with an odd body and white hair. Her hands only had three fingers who looked like hooks.

==Abilities==
She had the ability to temporarily kill the fungi of Araumycos.

==History==
''Rook'' was originally one of the [[dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]]. When she was killed, her bones were scattered by [[orc]]s around Araumycos as a final offense to the dwarves. She was later revived as a drow revenant and her task was to recover her bones and ask for adventurers exploring Araumycos to give her bones a proper dwarven burial.
