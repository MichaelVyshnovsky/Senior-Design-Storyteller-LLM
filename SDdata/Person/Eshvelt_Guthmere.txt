==Description==
Eshvelt was a [[human]] woman with a tan skin tone, gray eyes, and short black curly hair. Eshvelt wore an expensive duplet and a fanciful hat with two decorative feathers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, shortly before the armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lady Eshvelt Guthmere was a Parliamentarian of the Gate and voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the city's Archduke. Lady Guthmere was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of [[Wyrm's Rock]]. Following the coronation, Eshvelt voiced her trust in Gortash's commitment to securing Baldur's Gate.
