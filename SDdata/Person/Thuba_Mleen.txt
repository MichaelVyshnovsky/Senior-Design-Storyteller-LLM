'''Thuba Mleen''', also called the '''King in Yellow''', was a powerful [[psionicist]] living in the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|380|Thuba Mleen}}

==Description==
Thuba favored wearing yellow robes.

==Relationships==
Thuba commanded a pair of [[efreet]] by use of an [[genie prison|enchanted bottle]]. He was particularly cruel to the [[genie]]s, but spoke wisely when commanding them so they could not twist his words against him. The efreet planned and waited for the day when vengeance against their master would be theirs.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|465|Thuba's Efreeti Bottle}}

==Activities==
Little was known about the "King in Yellow" as few who entered his presence escaped with their lives or sanity intact. He led a secretive life within the vast Haunted Lands.

Thuba acquired the ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' from a priest who visited him and tried to usurp his throne. Thuba enjoyed having prisoners read from the book so he could learn more about it.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|466|Thuba's Book of Vile Darkness}}
