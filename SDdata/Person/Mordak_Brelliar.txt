Mordak Brelliar was the current apprentice of First Lord Maalthiir, often serving in the role as his most prolific agent. Mordak believed that the powers of Hillsfar should align with the Zhentarim, believing their combined power capable of reigning over the entire Moonsea region.
It was said that Mordak resembled a younger, less charismatic version of Khelben Arunsun.
Despite the possibilities of Mordaks ambitious scheme, his master did not share his view, not wanting to bow to Manshoon and the other Zhents. Mordak planned for years to eventually overthrow the First Lord, though the latter eventually caught wind of the plans. When the time came for Mordak to enact his treacherous coup, Maalthiir stopped his apprentice and reversed the attack. Maalthiirs powerful magics put Mordak directly under his control among these were dominate person, geas, and suggestion. From that time on, Mordak was unwillingly and unwaveringly faithful to his master, unable to progress by any of his own means.
