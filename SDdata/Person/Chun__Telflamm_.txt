'''Chun''' was a mid-level thug for the [[Nine Golden Swords]] in [[Telflamm]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Stardeep|32-37|4}}

==Possessions==
As of {{yearlink|1375}}, Chun had a pet bird he took to tea houses, and a [[daito]].

==History==
Chun had taken a daito sword from [[Raidon Kane]]'s father for a debt not owed. In {{yearlink|1375}}, Raidon Kane infiltrated the Nine Golden Swords looking to shame Chun and take back his family heirloom; Chun anticipated this, and went to a tea house that Raidon frequented, making a spectacle of bringing his pet songbird, bodyguards, and a woman with him.

Raidon rose to the bait and stood up to Chun; the thug told him that his application to the Nine Golden Swords was accepted, but instead of mollified, Raidon brought up his family's honor. Refusing to be placated by simply having the daito returned, Raidon got called a mongrel dog and they got into a fight. The monk fled after bloodying Chun's face and stealing back his daito.
