Kyland Lind was a Shadow Druid from the dark druid circle in Amn, located in the northeast of Trademeet in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Kyland was a human male with fair skin and brown hair who wore black druidic garb.
As a druid, Kyland had access to natures divine magic. Some of commonly used spells of his were chant, invisibility purge, defensive harmony, and mass cure. And Kyland wielded flame blade and summon insects spells offensively.
In the , Kyland Lind and his fellow Shadow Druids dispersed natures cruel punishment to civilized people of the southern edges of Amn. At some point, the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian was asked to solve the dire animal attacks on Trademeet. Subsequently, the adventurer and his companions uncovered that the onslaught was the doing of the Shadow Druids. Spite having little goodwill for civilized races, Kyland and a small group of drained found themselves following Faldorn and her aggressive ways. That allegiance was said to had Kyland face Abdel Adrian in battle and be slain. However, some claimed that the confrontation took place after Faldorns defeat, leaving Kyland and the Bhaalspawn part ways peacefully and the Shadow Druid vowing to work tirelessly fixing the nature balance broken by Faldorn.
