        "mainbody": "Korus Eikoth was the younger twin of Hassan Arslan, and second in the line of succession to the Oasis of the White Palm, as of . Resentful of his older twin brother, he had conspired to have both him and his father assassinated.\nKorus was basically dishonest and could not be counted to keep his word. He would lie and cheat to get his way.\nKorus was the youngest twin by minutes this made him ineligible to become the next Sheik. Because of his jealousy and lust for power, he let himself be used by the underground dervish cult within the Oasis of the White Palm.\nKorus wielded an enchanted scimitar, and a stronger, enchanted chain mail. He also carried six enchanted arrows, an a potion of ESP. He had three enchanted maces to turn over, should the adventurers agree to go to him first on finding the princess.\nThe prince kept a chest in his tent. There was a poison needle in the lock, and inside the tent, there were 20 pounds of silver,As Desert of Desolation is a 1st edition adventure, in which coins are 10 to a pound rather than 50, values are presented in pounds for the sake of edition neutrality. 5 pounds of electrum, and 5 pounds of gold alongside an unmarked bottle of poison. The real treasure was buried in the sand, one foot beneath the chest wrapped in a rug, there was another chest containing 30 pounds of gold, 10 pounds of platinum, and 8 gems, each of which was worth as much as 20 pounds of gold. There were also two potions a potion of brass dragon control, and a red liquid that seemed to glow slightly. This liquid ignited and exploded when exposed to air.\nKorus favourite slave was an elven woman named Kerina.\nWhile physically more resilient and far stronger than his brother, Korus nimbleness still fell short of his twins.\nHe sought to find his brothers missing bride, but not out of goodness rather, he knew that she was key to seizing power in the oasis. Korus wasnt above pretending to be his broter for the sake of concealing his activities and used this stratagem when he offered payment beyond what the sheik had offered to the adventurers for finding the princess, if only they would turn her over directly to him. He planned on having them killed as soon as he had the princess.\nThe prince was secretly a member of the dervish cult operating within the Oasis. Per his favourite slave, he donned a black robe in preparation for these evening services. He knew that the leader of the dervish cult planned on turning the missing princess over to a powerful spiritual ally.\nKorus was aware someone had taken over the Sandvoyagers Guild."
