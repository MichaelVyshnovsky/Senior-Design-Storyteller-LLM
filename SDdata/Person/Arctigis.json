        "mainbody": "'''Arctigis''' was a [[white dragon]] servant of [[Zhengyi]] in [[Vaasa]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Zhengyi subdued Arctigis centuries before when the wizard was still a living being.\n\nIn 1357 DR, Arctigis was protecting the walls of [[Castle Perilous]] when [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party infiltrated the castle.",
        "Personality": "Arctigis was a cruel and vicious being, who loved tormenting the weak. He truly enjoyed making illusions that had a captive believe they had the possibility of escape and then snatching that hope away. However, Arctigis had learned to be cautious in approaching powerful enemies.",
        "Relationship": "In his twisted way, Arctigis loved Zhengyi and he would do anything to avenge his death, not caring for his own safety."
