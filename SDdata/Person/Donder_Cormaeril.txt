Donder Cormaeril was Lord of House Cormaeril in Cormyr around the turn of the 13-century DR.
Donder was a tall man with green eyes and brown hair. For facial hair, he favored a mustache. He dressed smartly, ready for action.
He was a man of few words and had a pithy sense of humor.
Donder was an expert at swordsmanship and at breeding and training horses.
According to famed explorer and historian Volothamp Geddarm, Donder and his friend Althallan Crownsilver instigated a scheme to undermine the holdings of western Sembia and point the blame toward the Lord of Hullack.
While visiting House Jarthoon, Donder was cornered by Lord Ongmar Jarthoon and forced to make a choice between siding with him against King Pryntaler Obarskyr or death. Donder swiftly drew his sword, wounded Ongmar, and then used him as a shield to make his way over to a window above the courtyard. He then jumped from the high window and escaped on one of his prize horses.
As reported by Volo, Cormaeril was likely one of the creators and promulgators of the legend of the Hullack Hawkâ€”a notorious bandit that preyed on merchants from Sembia. He and co-conspirator Althallan led a search party organized by Chanthar Huntsilver away from the hiding place of the Hawk, allowing the brigand to escape.
