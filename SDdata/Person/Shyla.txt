'''Shyla''' of [[Damara]] was a [[barbarian]] hero from the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]] who died before the city's destruction in the [[Weeping War]], [[714 DR]].

==Possessions==
Shyla carried her prized large polished white ''[[shield of purity]]'', the item she took to the grave.

==History==
Shyla, along with her [[enchanted]] [[shield]], was laid to rest inside a heroes' crypt in the [[Elven Catacombs]]' First Cellar. The catacombs of the [[Castle Cormanthor]] were disturbed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] who invaded the ruins, and their [[drow]] allies who took to calling these dungeons their base in [[1369 DR]]. Alongside [[Arianna]] the Archer, [[Erik Sliphand]], [[Magister]] [[Luther]], [[Bannoc]], and [[Sindar]] the Warrior, their graves were corrupted by the wild magics unleashed during the Weeping War, cursing the fallen heroes with the [[undead]] existence as [[wraith]]s, forever guarding the artifacts they cherished in life.
