Shyla of Damara was a barbarian hero from the ancient city of Myth Drannor who died before the citys destruction in the Weeping War, 714 DR.
Shyla carried her prized large polished white shield of purity, the item she took to the grave.
Shyla, along with her enchanted shield, was laid to rest inside a heroes crypt in the Elven Catacombs First Cellar. The catacombs of the Castle Cormanthor were disturbed by the Cult of the Dragon who invaded the ruins, and their drow allies who took to calling these dungeons their base in 1369 DR. Alongside Arianna the Archer, Erik Sliphand, Magister Luther, Bannoc, and Sindar the Warrior, their graves were corrupted by the wild magics unleashed during the Weeping War, cursing the fallen heroes with the undead existence as wraiths, forever guarding the artifacts they cherished in life.
