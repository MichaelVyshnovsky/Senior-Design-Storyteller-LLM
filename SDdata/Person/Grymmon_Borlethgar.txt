'''Grymmon Borlethgar''' was a the [[Olembarlar]] of [[Tulmon]] in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faerûn]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a gruff individual with a large mustache. Grymmon stood well over {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. He was 80 years old ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Activities==
As Olembarlar, Grymmon was the head of Tulmon's armed forces—the [[Stone Spears]].

==Possessions==
He wore a splendid suit of [[plate armor]] and wielded a massive [[two-handed sword]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Many in Tulmon believed Grymmon was sustained to his advanced years by aid from [[Torm]] or [[Tempus]], but the truth was that his [[armor]] could fully ''[[heal]]'' him every few days as needed. Grymmon used this power when uninjured to rejeuvenate his body to that of a younger man.
