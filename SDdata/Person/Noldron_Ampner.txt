Noldron Ampner was the patriarch of the Ampner noble family of Ravens Bluff, following the death of his father Raedrin.
During the early 1370s DR, when the rest of his family seemed to lose interest in running their commercial holdings, Noldron took great initiative in keeping his familys wealth intact. After coming into a sudden influx of gold, he invested his windfall into local businesses and properties within the city.
There were some in Ravens Bluff that believed Noldron acted as a fence for smugglers who brought stolen goods into the city.
