'''Noldron Ampner''' was the patriarch of the [[Ampner]] noble family of [[Ravens Bluff]], following the death of his father [[Raedrin Ampner|Raedrin]].

==Background==
During the early 1370s [[DR]], when the rest of his family seemed to lose interest in running their commercial holdings, Noldron took great initiative in keeping his family's wealth intact. After coming into a sudden influx of [[gold]], he invested his windfall into local businesses and properties within the city.

There were some in Ravens Bluff that believed Noldron acted as a fence for smugglers who brought stolen goods into the city.
