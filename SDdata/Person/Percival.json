        "Description": "Although he was a squirrel, Percival was incredibly perceptive, able and loyal to Cadderly and his friends. The white squirrel could comprehend some words and phrases of [[Common]]. He was said to be a \"most excellent beast\" by [[Arcite]], a visiting druid to the [[Edificant Library]].",

Perhaps Cadderly’s closest friend.\n|source=[[Danica Maupoissant]]\n}}\nThe small creature enjoyed the company of Cadderly, as well as the cacasa nuts, butter and acorns the young priest would feed him.\n\nCadderly's bond to Percival became so strong that the priest gained abilities of the creature, and could even sprout white squirrel limbs to climb and leap across terrain, which a human would usually find impossible to traverse, with ease and speed.",
        "History": "Percival had a wealth of achievements during his life, including directly, and indirectly, saving the lives of hundreds of good people, if not more.\n\nPercival saved Cadderly's life from that of his rival, [[Kierkan Rufo]], when he confronted Cadderly with a knife. The squirrel had dexterously hopped from window to window to plant his body into Rufo's face as a distraction, giving Cadderly time to act.\n\nThe squirrel greatly aided in the effort to save the Edificant Library from the evil [[cleric]], [[Barjin]], who wished to release the ''[[Chaos Curse]]''. To do this, he watched the suspicious movements of those in the library, particularly the groundskeeper, [[Mullivy]], whom the squirrel despised. Furthermore, he led [[Danica Maupoissant|Danica]] and the druid [[Newander]] to the tunnels where Mullivy had been lured; Newander commented how remarkable the squirrel was. The squirrel then sniffed out the path to [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]], who was resurrected by the druid, and then to Cadderly, who with the help of the others, defeated Barjin. When the first threat was dealt with, Percival hibernated until about a year later. Here, Percival investigated the corruption of the library by [[undead]], and traveled to [[Shilmista]] forest to get the help of [[Shayleigh]], the [[elf|elven]] ranger. He led her to the library, which helped end the final threat.\n\nPercival also saved Cadderly's lover, Danica, from death several times: first during Barjin's assault on the library, and secondly from Rufo in his vampiric form."
