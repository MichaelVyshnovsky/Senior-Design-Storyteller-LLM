        "mainbody": "Mamood Kalin was a member of the Riders of Blood in 1367 DR.\nOriginally from Huzuz, Mamoods father was accused as being a traitor to the Grand Caliph and beheaded. Mamood carried hatred for the Grand Caliph and his misuse of justice since the day of his fathers execution.\nMamood used his magical abilities on raids against caravans traveling along Dihl al-Taif. He delighted in slaying as many living targets as possible, a behavior that often riled Fasim Kaldur who believed the animals should be left alive for use or resale.\nMamoods brother was Alai Kalin."
