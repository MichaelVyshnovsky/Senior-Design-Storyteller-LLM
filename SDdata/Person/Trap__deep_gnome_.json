        "mainbody": "Trap was a deep gnome child that lived in a community near the ruins of Dolblunde during the 15 century DR.\nWhile she was was somewhat impulsive, Trap cared deeply for her family and demonstrated much bravery.\nTrap and her sister Tricks family included their loving parents. Their pap told them stories about powerful items, specifically items of profound power.\nthumb|right|225px|Trap proved to be the hero that Xenk believed he could be.\nAt some point during the 1400s DR,Tricks story related to the helmet of disjunction occurs some time after the Battle of the Evermoors.The battle is undated but is \"a century ago\" from the date of Honor Among Thieves. Trap and Tricks gnome village were taken captive by a group of illithids led by the elder brain Zuphelithid. \nThe two sisters managed to escape danger by hiding in the ruins of Dolblunde, located near their village. They searched after the powerful helmet of disjunction, which was in the possession of a traveling paladin, Xenk Yendar. The duo manipulated Xenk by pretending they were in trouble, entrapping him beneath a sleeping earth elemental. They managed to steal the helm for a few moments, before the paladin caught up with them. The girls appealed to Xenks sense of justice and right, explaining that they needed the artifact to save their people. Xenk vowed that he would intervene on their behalf.\nXenk the paladin ventured into the lair of the elder brain Zuphelithid. Trap and Trick followed some ways behind, carrying with them the helm of disjunction. Unfortunately for the trio, Xenk was overwhelmed by the elder brain and subdued by his psychic powers. Zuphelithid stole the helm from Trick, and enthralled her just as it had done to her family.\nTrap and Xenk were distraught by their defeat, but undeterred from saving Trick. Xenk marched off to fight Zuphelithid once again, and Trap piloted a massive, earth-moving vehicle into the lair behind him. Trap drove the machine through the elder brains lair, and used it to pierce the fortified bubble that surrounded its brain. This gave Xenk the opportunity to cleave the massive elder brain in half. \nThrough their efforts, Trick was freed from the mental domination, and the gnome villagers were freed. In exchange, the grateful Trick offered to help Xenk hide away the helm of disjunction, as he sought to do when he met her and Trap. The three heroes bid each other well Xenk left for the surface world, and the two sisters reunited with their parents."
