'''Mindi''' was a child fan of the dancer known as [[Shimmer]] from the [[Blushing Mermaid]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Mindi was a young girl with curly blonde hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Shimmer was a regular performer who entertained the customers of the shady Blushing Mermaid tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. Shimmer was a popular performer known for his loud [[makeup]], glittering outfits, and impressive dancing. He had one devoted fanâ€”the young Mindi, who was in fact too young to frequent the Blushing Mermaid, according to her father. The child passionately begged Shimmer to become his apprentice, believing him to be the best dancer she'd ever seen, and she already was a great dancer, in her own words, able to do two cartwheels in a row. She offered the services of a makeup artist, outfit washer, and a hairstylist in exchange for apprenticeship.
