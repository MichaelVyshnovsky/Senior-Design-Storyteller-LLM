        "mainbody": "Capn Gyudd, who went by no other name, was a former adventurer and a shopkeeper in the city of Bral in the mid–14 century DR.\nCapn Gyudd was a lean and strong dwarf, but in his later years, he walked with a limp on a polished ivory peg-leg—although he claimed that it was carved from the \"eye-tooth\" of a radiant dragon.\nIn his retired years, Capn Gyudd weighed  and stood  tall.\nThe Capn owned a shop on the leading edge of the Rock of Bral called, fittingly, Capn Gyudds. Located on the border of the Dwarven District, it was a very popular store and sold all manner of mundane spacefaring gear at reasonable prices. It was such a popular store that tour guides often brought people there.\nCapn Gyudd loved beer it was his first love and was stronger than his love for women. He also smoked a great deal of tobacco, such that his store reeked of it.\nThe Capn also enjoyed sharing stories and legends with customers, and his shop attracted many—as he called them—\"breakfast table commandos\", who wished they could travel into wildspace but never had the courage to do so. (He happily sold such folk \"space souvenirs\" and small nautical trinkets.)\nCapn Gyudd owned a magical throwing warhammer, a suit of magical chainmail, and a ring of protection and a ring of protection against charm.\nCapn Gyudd was good friends with Gamalon Idogyr, and the two once adventured together. While both men were retired in Bral, they sent potential customers to each others stores.\nCapn Gyudd was once enslaved as \"cattle\" by a group of illithids. The Capn managed to escape and also rescued nearly three dozen other hapless souls.\nHe is most famous for the manner in which he lost his leg. In a wildspace battle, he voluntarily placed himself into a heavy catapult and launched himself onto an enemy spelljammer. Part of his foot got caught in the ships rigging and was ripped off. His body tumbled to the deck, and he was knocked unconscious and almost bled to death. His crew performed an amputation and cauterized the wound to stop the bleeding, and their next stop was the Rock of Bral. Capn Gyudd retired from adventuring that day."
