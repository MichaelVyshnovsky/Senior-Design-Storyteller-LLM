        "mainbody": "Elvar the Grainlord was the ruler of Triel in the mid-14 century DR. He was impersonated a lot throughout the rest of the century.\nElvar had true terror at the idea of running out of food, and devoted intense energy to protecting his stocks of food. He was also unusually given to change the focus of his worship, and had rotated through the entire Faerunian pantheon twice. He was a simple soul, and refused to travel away from Triel.\nHe changed his religion almost once a tenday, occupying two carpenters almost full-time. However, he was a competent leader for the farming community. He gave good advice, and got paid well.\nA local priestess of Chauntea, Antriera, kept hiding his accoutrements of Loviatar when he converted to another god again. For all his excentricities, he was well-loved locally.\nAccording to Arauntar on , Elvars madness had begun a score of years prior (approximately ) and had since grown so obsessed with making sure there was enough food to survive the winter that he had every rat caught and pickled, and he also allowed no outsiders in the place. He also claimed Elvar converted to a new religion every four days since- faster by then. He also claimed that Elvar was something of a thief himself.\nUnknown to anyone, Elvar had been dead for some time by the end of that year when Orthil Voldovans caravan reached Triel. He was supplanted by an imposter since."
