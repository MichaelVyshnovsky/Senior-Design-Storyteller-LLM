Called Alemander the Spellbinder, he was regarded as one of the Hero-Kings of Tethyr.\nAlemander was a wizard before he became a monarch.\nAlemanders sword, the Lions Sword, was forged by a dwarven ally. Alemander later enchanted the blade, granting it the power of flame, a magical power that was rare at that time for weapons in Tethyr.\nAs king, Alemander I gave royal contributions to support the orders of Tormish and Ilmatari priests at Barakmordin, who had supported him in his rise to power. With these funds, the fortified abbey received its outer walls and a new central keep.\nAlemander I was the oldest grandson of King Coram I. and a younger brother named Coram II, who for some reason lost to scholars, took the throne before him.\nAlemander was born in 1038 DR.

His father Natan died saving all of them.\nIn 1070 DR, Teremir Bormul started a coup against King Coram II, Alemanders brother. In the month of Kythorn, after a personal duel, Coram II was killed by Teremir, who took the throne as Teremir II and restored the dynasty of his great-grandfather. Before a year had passed, however, Alemander avenged his death and retook the throne for the Lions Dynasty by the month of Ches.\nIn the first year of his reign, Alemander had all of Teremirs heirs executed.\nIn 1090 DR, King Alemander forced a treaty with King Imnel IV of neighboring Amn. As part of the treaty, Amn ceded all of its lands south of the Tethir Road to Tethyr in exchange for a large sum of money and military support against monsters in the region.\nAlemander lived an exceptionally long life for a human, over 100 years, dying at last in 1145 DR. He was succeeded by his third-oldest great-grandson, Coram III."
