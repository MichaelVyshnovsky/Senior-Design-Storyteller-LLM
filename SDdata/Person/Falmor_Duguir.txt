'''Falmor Duguir''' was a reader of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette'' [[broadsheet]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Falmor Duguir came across an issue of ''Baldur's Mouth Gazette'' on his recently passed uncle's desk. The issue's puzzle section titled "Win a Peek at [[Candlekeep]]" was half finished. Falmor put some time and effort into the puzzle and eventually completed it. He penned a letter for the Puzzle Editor of the ''Gazette'' and enclosed the solved puzzle, asking who he would need to talk to claim the prize. Falmor also asked if he were to come to the Baldur's Mouth building in the Lower City, would [[Ettvard Needle]] be the person to talk to, as he also had a piece of his mind to give to the Editor-in-Chief.
