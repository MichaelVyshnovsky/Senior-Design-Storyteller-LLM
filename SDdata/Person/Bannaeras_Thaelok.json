        "mainbody": "'''Bannaeras Thaelok''' was the operator of [[Thaelok's Fine Leathers]], a tannery operating out of a small bay south of the main harbor of [[Port Llast]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Aside from his main occupation, Thaelok also farmed [[squid]] and [[octopus]]es.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Monster Breeding for Fun and Profit}}",
        "History": "Prior to settling in Port Llast, Thaelok operated out of [[Athkatla]], until business took a turn for the worse after some bad deals. He relocated to the north to get away from rivals and creditors.\n\nHaving set up shop in Port Llast, Thaelok's Fine Leathers primarily worked with [[roth√©]] hides, but also with [[ox]]en, [[Cow|cattle]], and [[deer]].\n\nAs a result of pumping boiling water used for tanning into the bay for years, Thaelok inadvertently cultivated a thick bed of algae, attracting a population of squid and predatory cold-water octopi. Seeing an opportunity, Thaelok started catching and farming the molluscs and selling them as fertilizer or food. Some unsavory patrons, including [[Niklor the Masked]] of [[Waterdeep]] and [[Ulbaerl Taraskus]] of Athkatla, even bought the animals as live specimens for the purposes of breeding and magically transforming them to keep as guardians."
