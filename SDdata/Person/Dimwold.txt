Dimwold was a fire mephit in the service of Orcus in the Abyss in 1357 DR.
Dimwold was bored of his work. He considered himself a genius, destined to rule like a demon lord. He waiting for the right occasion to advance himself. He hated Ter-soth. He always acted for his self-interest, betraying anyone.
Dimwold acted as a messenger between the balor commander Ter-soth and the palace of Orcus but often he was very lazy.
Dimwold typically carried on his person twelve platinum pieces, a +1 dagger, and a mirror of opposition that he stole from Ter-soth.
At one point, Ter-soth reported that Dimwold was bad in his work and the mephit was punished being confined to the mountains. In 1357 DR, he was waiting for the occasion to avenge this and maybe advance himself.
