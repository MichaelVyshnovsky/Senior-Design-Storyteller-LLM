        "mainbody": "Relchoz Hriiat was a baker in the city of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR, owner and operator of Hriiat Fine Pastries, as well as the public contact for the citys Bakers Guild.The book Adventurers Guide to the City in the City of Splendors boxed-set states that the Hriiat Fine Pastries is run by \"the master of the Bakers Guild\". This would make the owner Dundold Buldharroaz. However, other sources, including the two other books included within that box-set, clearly state that the owner is Relchoz Hriiat.\nRelchoz was a rather short and portly human male.\nRelchoz had a jolly demeanor to him, but a gluttonous streak, often sampling his own wears.\nIn addition to sampling his own wears, the jolly baker often offered sample bites of his pastries to customers. Beyond the realm of bakery, however, the popularity of Hriiat Fine Pastries endowed Relchoz with such an extent of wealth that he was able to be an investor in about a fifth of all business concerns in Waterdeep that werent exclusive to one of the citys guilds. This widespread investing went unbeknownst to most Waterdhavians."
