        "Possessions": "After he and his fellow goblins abducted the famed writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Piddle got his hands on a copy of his latest unpublished manuscript, ''[[On Goblins: My Life Among the Conquering Host]]''.",
        "Relationships": "He was subordinate to Priestess [[Gut]] and was in awe of the tremendous power bestowed upon her by the Absolute.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the goblinoid cultists of the Absolute sacked the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn and made their way back to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] to celebrate. Piddle kept away from drinking, fighting, and chasing [[chicken]]s, preferring to pass his time deep in study."
