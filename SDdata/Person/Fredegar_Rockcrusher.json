        "mainbody": "'''Fredegar Rockcrusher''', also known as '''Fret''', was a [[dwarf]] sage under the charge of [[Alustriel]] in [[Silverymoon]]. He was a trusted advisor to both Alustriel and her sister [[Dove Falconhand]].",
        "Description": "Fredegar had a snow-white hair and beard. He dressed in the finest cloth and had an [[elf]]-like musical voice.\n\nFret was a very clean and tidy dwarf, who liked things and people around him to be clean and tidy also. While [[Catti-brie]] was in Silverymoon, Fret helped her to clean herself up.\n\nDespite his curious and awkward nature of being the most pampered and clean dwarf in all of [[Faerûn]], he proved himself more than once in battle when his favorite vestments were dirtied by a [[mind flayer]]'s brain matter after going into a fit of rage against a drow onslaught.",
        "History": "Fret was born in [[Citadel Adbar]], but spent many years in Silverymoon.\n\nAround [[1340 DR]], Fret was one of the members of a group alongside Dove Falconhand who hunted [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] when he first came to the surface.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Fret aided [[Companions of the Hall]] Catti-brie in tracking down Drizzt when he returned to the [[Underdark]] on his journey to [[Menzoberranzan]] and gave her Lady Alustriel's [[Cat's Eye]] circlet. Later, Fret also assisted the dwarves of [[Mithral Hall]] in their preparation and fight in the war with Menzoberranzan.",
        "Scholarship": "Fret was a well-known scholar and proclaimed himself the \"'best-loved sage' of Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon.\" His most influential work involved inter-species relations, particularly [[humanoid]]s and [[demihuman]]s and he was considered the foremost expert on this subject in all of [[the North]] and perhaps even all of Faerûn."
