        "mainbody": "redegar Rockcrusher, also known as Fret, was a dwarf sage under the charge of Alustriel in Silverymoon. He was a trusted advisor to both Alustriel and her sister Dove Falconhand.\nFredegar had a snow-white hair and beard. He dressed in the finest cloth and had an elf-like musical voice.\nFret was a very clean and tidy dwarf, who liked things and people around him to be clean and tidy also. While Catti-brie was in Silverymoon, Fret helped her to clean herself up.\nDespite his curious and awkward nature of being the most pampered and clean dwarf in all of Faerûn, he proved himself more than once in battle when his favorite vestments were dirtied by a mind flayers brain matter after going into a fit of rage against a drow onslaught. \nFret was born in Citadel Adbar, but spent many years in Silverymoon.\nAround 1340 DR, Fret was one of the members of a group alongside Dove Falconhand who hunted Drizzt DoUrden when he first came to the surface.\nIn the , Fret aided Companions of the Hall Catti-brie in tracking down Drizzt when he returned to the Underdark on his journey to Menzoberranzan and gave her Lady Alustriels Cats Eye circlet. Later, Fret also assisted the dwarves of Mithral Hall in their preparation and fight in the war with Menzoberranzan.\nFret was a well-known scholar and proclaimed himself the \"best-loved sage of Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon.\" His most influential work involved inter-species relations, particularly humanoids and demihumans and he was considered the foremost expert on this subject in all of the North and perhaps even all of Faerûn."
