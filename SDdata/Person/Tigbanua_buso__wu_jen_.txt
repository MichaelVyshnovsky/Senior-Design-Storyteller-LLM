His name unknown, a mighty human wu jen of Wa was once cursed by the gods to take the form of a tigbanua buso. He lurked in the forests of Aru Province in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar.
Once, he had been a human man and a wu jen of both incredible power and incredible ambition. Growing mad, he even tried to challenge the Eight Million Gods for control of Toril. For anyone else, the gods might just have ignored him, but for a wu jen of his power, they dared not. Thus, an alliance among the gods cursed him and transformed into a tigbanua buso. This didnt exactly eliminate his threat, however as a tigbanua buso, he attacked innocents and could turn them into tagamaling busos.
Several centuries later, in the summer of , while a group of samurai were hunting in the forest, the tigbanua buso ambushed Takako Shimizu when she became separated. She barely had time to scream before it knocked her out. The alerted samurai rushed to her side, and Tazumi saw it crouched over her, but the monster escaped them, and none could identify it. But with no more than a scratch and a bump, Takako confidently dismissed this incident as just another monster attack.
But, several weeks later, Takako suffered a nightmare of being helplessly swallowed by a hideous one-eyed monster. In a strange bout of sleepwalking, she also transformed into a tagamaling buso and murdered a samurai in the Donjon of Aru, before awaking with no memory of the experience. Adventurers in service to the daimyo likely investigated the incident Upon learning of the condition, they sought a cure or a cause. A powerful shukenja found it was no normal busos disease, but a spiritual taint. With Tazumi to guide them, the adventurers returned to the forest and likely hunted down the unusual tigbanua buso, though it proved a cunning and dangerous prey, and at last slew it, ending Takakos and others afflictions.
Having once been a man, this tigbanua buso retained some intelligence, above that of the busos normal animal-like mentality, but it was just as chaotic and evil.
Though he lost all his wu jen magic, he had all the powers of a tigbanua buso, and the victims of his infected claws could turn into tagamaling busos. However, because he wasnt a true buso, it wasnt a real infection but a kind of spiritual taintâ€”those turned into tagamaling busos couldnt be cured normally but would be cured as soon as the tigbanua buso was slain. This was likely little comfort to his victims after his centuries of existence.
