        "mainbody": "'''Bran Skorlsun''' was a well-respected member of the [[Harper]]s of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He dared to love an elven princess, [[Amnestria Moonflower]], and was the father of [[Arilyn Moonblade]] and was also a key driver in the [[Harper Schism]] that led to the creation of the [[Tel'Teukiira]]. He was known as '''the Raven''' (as ''bran'' means \"[[raven]]\" in an ancient Moonshae language).",
        "Description": "Bran was a tall man who had a weathered but square-jawed, healthy-looking face.",
        "Personality": "Bran was known to be hot-headed, stubborn and unreasonable. His desire for a 'pure' Harper organization was supposedly formed during his forty years as a tracker of spies and turncloaks. He generally had a grim outlook and preferred to be alone.\n\nBran disliked magic being used on him.",
        "Abilities": "Bran was a very strong warrior. He could hold a man aloft with only one hand but he also possessed the grace and stealth of a cat. He was highly skilled in the use of [[dagger]]s, [[longsword]]s, and [[longbow]]s and likely other weapons too.\n\nHe was an exceptional tracker. His tracking skills were matched by few in the Harpers.",
        "Possessions": "Bran's arrows were all marked with ravens, his namesake.",
        "History": {
            "The Trial of Khelben": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Bran discovered that the ''[[Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings]]'', a powerful [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[artifact]], had been stolen from the [[Catacombs of Ordulin]], where the Harpers had hidden it for the past century. Bran reported this to the Harpers at [[Twilight Hall]] on [[Ches 7]]. Over the next two months, the Harpers investigated and by [[Tarsakh 15]] discovered that Khelben had been the one who had stolen the artifact, thirteen years previously. This artifact had since ended up in the hands of the [[Zhentarim]]. With this, Bran had finally discovered the evidence that proved Khelben a traitor.\n\nBran was among several senior Harpers present at Twilight Hall to discuss the next course of action. Bran was one of three Harpers chosen to preside over Khelben's trial, along with [[Obslin Minstrelwish]], Seneschal of Twilight Hall, and [[Belhuar Thantarth]], who ran the Harper stronghold in the absence of [[Cylyria Dragonbreast]], who was severely ill at the time. The Twilight Trio, as they came to be known, kept the proceedings from Cylyria at the urging of Obslin, who was in love with her and didn't want the stress to affect her recovery. Bran seized on every piece of evidence that showed Khelben to have acted inappropriately, while choosing to ignore most evidence that suggested otherwise. His single-mindedness spurred the Trio to accuse Khelben of corruption and conspiracy, charges which, when brought to trial, Khelben readily admitted to without remorse. Khelben and [[Laeral Silverhand]] both resigned from the Harpers, immediately returning to their home in [[Waterdeep]]. In the aftermath, Bran was chosen to succeed Khelben as a Master Harper, leading some to suspect him of ambition and vendetta in accusing Khelben.",
            "The Harper Schism": "Having been unable to punish Khelben for his admitted guilt, Bran and Belhuar spread the word that Khelben was a traitor to the Harpers. Within two months, all Harper holds had been warded against entry by Khelben and Laeral while Obslin continued to keep the news from Cylyria. Twilight Hall became a center for anti-traitor sentiment and investigations were made into all Harper activities. Bran's aim of keeping the Harpers 'pure' gained the support of a great many of Those Who Harp and a witch hunt began among the ranks for traitors. Cylyria, when she recovered from her illness, was powerless to stop events already in motion while Obslin and Belhuar, although having only the best intentions at heart, had been caught up in Bran's zeal like many others.\n\nThe Harpers were divided. Many Harpers who weren't caught up in Bran's witch hunt continued with their lives as if nothing had happened, while the rest trusted Khelben implicitly and either took no action against him or resigned too, joining his new rival organization, the Tel'Teukiira."
