'''Heidar Qan''' was an Amir of the [[Jann of the Haunted Lands]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|22}}<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p44">

==History==
Heidar Qan was credited with constructing the great fortress of [[Sarahin]] within the [[Haunted Lands]].

During a hunting trip, he released his prized golden eagle. The eagle settled on a rock, drawing the Amir's attention to the tranquil beauty and inherent strength of the site. He commanded his servants to build his fortress upon that very site, later naming it Sarahin, which meant ''wolves' den''.

After the construction of his fortress, Heidar stopped paying fealty to the [[Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]] and disappeared without a trace. As of [[1367 DR]], Heidar Qan had not been seen for 50 years, causing much unrest among the [[jann]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In reality, the rumors of Heidar's illness or death were false. Heidar was captured and held by the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] and their sinister master, [[Nar-Aidiya|The Bonfire]]. The motive behind his kidnapping remained unclear.
