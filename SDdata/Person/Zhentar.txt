'''Zhentar''' was a skilled [[wizard]] invited to help govern the quickly growing settlement that would later be known as [[Zhentil Keep]].<ref name=FRA-p121">

==History==
Zhentar was hired by [[Elephstron]] and the other ruling merchants of the settlement. Zhentar began stealthily slaying the other merchants and replacing them with his own puppets. When Elephestron discovered what was happening he confronted Zhentar in a battle that resulted in both of their deaths. However, Zhentar's seeds had already been planted and the settlement would later be named in his honor.<ref name=FRA-p121"/>

Before his death Zhentar also introduced the worship of [[Bane]] to the city.<ref name=FRA-p121"/>
