Awang possessed a ring of teleportation.
Awang Sophir was a mysterious monk who arrived in Suijeng with four students from Petan to participate in the Komite. He was a master of the mystical style of silat but knew nothing about Chu Yuan. Awang Sophir managed to finish among the tournaments finalists. 
In one of the final rounds of the tournament, he competed against an adventurer but Awang was disqualified for his use of a magical lucky charm. Awang promised vengeance against the adventurer.
Later, Awang tricked some villagers into believing that his adventurer opponent and their companions were demons and sent them to kill them, but with no success.
Soon after, Awang took control of the leaderless taring village of Gigit in Kutuk Valley. He ruled there until his adventurer opponent and their companions and/or the previous vampire ruler Xi-Chu came to Gigit. Awang quickly escaped using his ring of teleportation to avoid a confrontation.
Following again his adventurer opponent and their companions, Awang was attacked by tigers and injured. However, he was nursed back to health by a barbarian tribe. Again he tricked the barbarians into believing that his adventurer opponent and their companions were demons and led them to Tempat Larang to have vengeance.
At Tempat Larang, he attacked the adventurers and Osari Minhiro just before they entered the demiplane of Qui but Awang was defeated. Nevertheless, he followed his enemies into the demiplane.
In Qui, however, Awang couldnt manage to find the exit and at last was killed and eaten by a pack of jackals.
