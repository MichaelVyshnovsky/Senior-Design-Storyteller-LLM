}}'''Nchaser''' was a powerful mage who was famous for creating ''[[glowing globe]]s'' and the spell ''[[Nchaser's glowing orb]]''.{{Cite dragon/62/Pages from the Mages|17}}<ref>

==Relationships==
Nchaser's tutor in [[the Art]] was [[Nulathoe]], from whom he learned the unique spell ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]''.

==History==
Nchaser was known for actively exploring the world, seeking out new [[magic]] and only twice settling down to act as an advisor for local rulers, the second time being for the [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captains]] of [[Luskan]]. During this stay in Luskan, he penned a [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Nchaser's Eiyromancia]]'', which he gifted to High Captain [[Taerl]] before departing the city.<ref group="note">Nchaser's personal spellbook is referred to as ''Nchaser's Eiyromancia'' in all materials except the 2nd edition ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV]]'' (1995), where it is listed as ''Nchaser's Elyromancia''. The book was subsequently stolen, and would become the subject of a folk legend which claimed (not without some truth) that everyone who opened it was doomed to die.

He disappeared sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1337}}{{cite book/Magic of Faer√ªn|11}}

===Legacy===
The explorer [[Darnell the Unfearing]] claimed to have come upon a tower on an island suspended above [[Abeir-Toril]]'s north pole by a 300-foot-tall (90 meters) stalagmite of perfectly smooth ice. When he climbed up it, he reported it being surrounded by hundreds of glowing globes, which promptly shot at him as he drew closer to the top. The magical beams fired at him disintegrated the otherwise indestructible ice of the island and Darnell reportedly slid back down the ice so fast that he broke both of his legs when he reached the bottom. However, some doubted Darnell's story.

Apart from his glowing globes and possibly this tower, the only remaining legacy of Nchaser in the Realms were two [[spellbook]]s: his ''Eiyromancia'' as well as a collaboration with the [[archmage]] [[Tulrun]] entitled ''[[Luminescence and Coloration]]''.{{Cite dragon/82/Spells between the covers|58}} His ''Eiyromancia'' found its way into the possession of the likes of High Lady [[Alustriel]] of [[Silverymoon]] and Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] of Neverwinter, where it killed one of Nasher's courtiers. It was thus placed in Nasher's library as of the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, but was stolen during one of the riots known collectively as the [[Five Fires Rising]].
