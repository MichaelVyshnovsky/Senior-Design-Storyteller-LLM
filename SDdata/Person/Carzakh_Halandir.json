Carzakh quickly promoted an other trusted assassin and thief with wizard ability to the commands chain and the Three (as they were dubbed) proceeded to the transformation and reformation of the guild.\nThe Three decided to move in south Faerûn and change the guilds focus from assassin and thieves to wizard and priests those proved good moves and the guild began to infiltrated the government of Amn. After 1341 DR, when Shadow thieves had control over criminal operation in most South Faerûn, Carzach and the Three decided to reformed their-self as Shadow Council adding more members to the commands chain, but all Bhaal-worshiping assassins.\nThis proved a setback, because in 1358 DR the avatara god Bane deduced to absorb the souls of all the assassins of the Realms and so Carzarkh and all the Shadow Council died, open the gate of the modern Shadow Council.\nCategoryAssassins\nCategoryThieves\nCategoryRogues\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWorshipers of Bhaal\nCategoryMembers of the Shadow Thieves\nCategoryInhabitants of Athkatla\nCategoryInhabitants of Amn\nCategoryInhabitants of the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Zehoarastria\n218u01o5h6879fl8dns9hvrqpjxjj64"
