        "mainbody": "'''Annathorn Rose''' was a female [[drow]] inhabitant of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Annathorn Rose and five other [[Lolth]]sword drow women were targeted and eventually murdered by Orin the Red, a [[Bhaalspawn]] member of the [[Murder Tribunal]] that hid its ugly carcass under the streets of Baldur's Gate. In her depraved commitment to [[Bhaal]], the deity of murder, Orin hunted down individuals who came to represent other Bhaalspawn, who pressed a century earlier in the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]], in this case â€“ the drow Bhaalspawn [[Sendai]]. Annathorn Rose and the other drow were turned into gory dark effigy to the Lord of Murder in the cave basement of the groundkeeper of the [[Bloomridge Park]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]."
