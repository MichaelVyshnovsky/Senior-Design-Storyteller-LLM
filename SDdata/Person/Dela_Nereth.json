        "mainbody": "'''Dela Nereth''' was a black marker merchant and a taskmaster of the [[Bloodsailors]] gang of the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|Either way, Dela's kept her ear to the door and her nose to the ground, sniffing out all sorts of goods that the Bloodsailors might find useful.|Dela Nereth}}",
        "Description": "Dela was a pale-skinned young [[half-elven]] woman with blonde hair and a stern demeanor, wrapped in black [[leather armor]] with an [[Dela's rapier|enchanted rapier]] at her side at all times.",
        "History": "Dela Nereth joined the Bloodsailors sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. She and her gang survived the strife of that year: the [[plague]] of the [[Wailing Death]] that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between [[Luskan]] and Neverwinter. The war brought a short occupation of Neverwinter, and with the occupation, many valuable items began popping up on the market: magic equipment, family heirlooms, and valuables brought to Neverwinter by Luskanites. Dela acquired many such spoils of war and resold them to the friends of Bloodsailors. Later that year, Bloodsailors found themselves in a gang war against the [[Blackriver Bandits]]. A sailor adventurer known as [[Eater-of-Garm]] had to pick a side in the gang war and either stand against Bloodsailors, slaughtering the gang's leaders or doing the same for the Blackriver Bandits. Were the adventurer to oppose the Bloodsailors, Dela would lure Eater-of-Garm to her shop in the [[Seedy Tarven]] and attempt to assassinate them. Were the adventurer to set off against the Blackriver Bandits, Dela would offer her black market goods to the adventurers to aid them in the war."
