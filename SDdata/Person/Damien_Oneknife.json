        "mainbody": "Damien Oneknife was a halfling thief and assassin operating in Faerûn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nA highly skilled assassin, Damien would journey across Faerûn to hunt down his victims. He was known for his cunning and he always tried to benefit from the assets of his enemies, whatever they were.\nOne battle saw him barely survive against a group of ghouls. In a bid to improve his chances in subsequent battles, Damien skinned one of them and had the hide crafted into armor by a halfling armorer who was adept in enchanting leather. The grisly result, called the skin of the ghoul, provided heightened protection against the ghouls signature paralyzing attack.\nHe never refused a contract, bar one. Damien was at one stage approached by an individual known as the Dockman and asked to assassinate the legendary drow warrior Drizzt DoUrden. He first refused, knowing of Drizzts superior prowess. However, the next day, the Dockman gifted him with an incredibly enchanted dagger called Risktaker, which, unbeknownst to Damien, impaired his reasoning and judgment, and a polite request soon persuaded him otherwise. In time, Damien was killed by Drizzts companions, never even reaching him.\nThe skin of the ghoul was in the possession of the ghoul Theshal, mayor of Ghoul Town in the sewers of Athkatla in Amn by 1369 DR. Risktaker, meanwhile, eventually fell into the clutches of a drider assassin on the island of Shaoris Fell in the Underdark by 1372 DR."
