'''Raamilat''' was a powerful [[drow]] [[wizard]] who allied himself with [[Jon Irenicus]].

==History==
When Irenicus attacked his former home, [[Suldanessellar]], he struck a pact with the dark elves of [[Ust Natha]]. Raamilat, along with a summoned [[nabassu]], joined in on this assault and blocked access to the house of the elven high priestess [[Demin]]. It was essential to block access to Demin, as she had information for [[Gorion's Ward]] about Irenicus. Raamilat attacked the party of the ward with an array of spells, summoned creatures, and an enchanted [[quarterstaff]]. Eventually, he was slain by the party, and the priestess was saved.
