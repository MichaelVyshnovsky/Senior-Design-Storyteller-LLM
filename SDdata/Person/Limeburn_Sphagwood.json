        "mainbody": "'''Limeburn Sphagwood''' was a cultist of [[Bane]] who served the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Limeburn was a [[human]] man who wore dark hooded Baneite robes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of Bane]] joined forces with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], led by the [[Chosen]] of Bane, Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Limeburn Sphagwood was a part of the Cult's operations that targeted the countless refugees that flooded Baldur's Gate. His branch of the Cult assembled donations and toys rigged with [[blackpowder]] explosives in the [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shop's third floor. Presumably, Limeburn perished during or shortly before the Cult attacked Baldur's Gate."
