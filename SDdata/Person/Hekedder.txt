'''Hekedder''' was an infamous [[barbarian]] [[shaman]] from the [[Frozen North]] and the creator of the ''[[Blood Iron]]'' [[short sword]] who was active many years before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Hekedder was a man of wicked morals who created the crude [[enchanted]] blade imbued with [[necromantic]] magics. He gifted the sword to his cousin and, in the years that followed, the cousin and all subsequent wielders of the blade found themselves hated because of the ''Blood Iron's'' necromantic taint, which was much reviled by the barbarian tribes of the North. Hekedder's creation became infamous among his people long before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, with them thinking even uttering the sword's name to be a curse.
