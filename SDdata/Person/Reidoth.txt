Reidoth was a druid who spent much time in the village of Thundertree and was a member of the Emerald Enclave in the late 15 century DR.
The druid had a white beard, and was lean and haggard. He was said to know a lot about the land and locations in the nearby area. He did not receive many adventurers, and was rather tight-lipped. He was able to take the form of a squirrel if attacked, allowing him to swiftly scamper away.
He was old friends with Qelline Alderleaf.
Circa the , Reidoth set out from Phandalin to the ruined village of Thundertree. After discovering the village was teeming with ash zombies and twig blights, he put up a sign near the entrance, warning adventurers of the horrors.
Reidoth made camp in a building to the southwest of the village. The building was in much better condition than the others, and had iron bands and wooden shutters lining the windows. The druid had seen cultists and even a green dragon in the area, and he wished it would clear out of Thundertree.
