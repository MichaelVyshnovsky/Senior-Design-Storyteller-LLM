        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century, weapons forged by Gerzan were considered some of the best examples of dwarvish craftsmanship as well as valued for Gerzan's skills as a weapon [[enchanted|enchanter]]. In the {{yearlink|1370}}, an adventurer and explorer of the [[Undermountain]], [[Tolem Grandelwood]], owned one of the legendary master's [[sword]]s. He cherished his thrice-enchanted blade and refused to trade it for any treasure from the great dungeon underneath [[Waterdeep]]."
