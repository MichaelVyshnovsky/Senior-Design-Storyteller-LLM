'''Xazax the Eyemonger''' was a [[beholder]] in the [[Underdark]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Xazax was an unusual beholder who, with the help of his servant and surgeon [[Peebles]] the [[deep gnome]], grafted onto himself the eyestalks of other beholders after killing them.

During the [[demon]]ic crisis that struck the Underdark ''circa'' [[1486 DR]], he sent Peebles to [[Mantol-Derith]] to search for more beholders from which to take new eyestalks.

==Relationship==
Xazax had a trusted attendant in the form of the deep gnome Peebles.

==Abilities==
At the time, Xazax had eighteen eyestalks but couldn't fire rays from the grafted eyes; they were purely cosmetic.
