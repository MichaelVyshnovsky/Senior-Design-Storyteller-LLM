'''Len-jes''' was the harbormaster of the [[Docks District (Neverwinter)|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Description==
Len-jes was known for her scars.

==Personality==
Len-jes appeared to be calm and collected, but actually the fury of the [[Elemental Chaos]] burned in her.

==Activities==
Len-jes was Neverwinter's habormaster, chief exchequer and accountant. As the master of trade of Neverwinter, she was vital to keep commerce flowing into the City.

==Abilities==
Len-jes was a "hydromancer", and so her abilities were stronger that those of the standard [[Watersoul genasi|watersoul]] [[genasi]]. She had a reputation of being a powerful combatant.

==History==
Years before [[1479 DR]], Len-jes was a [[corsair]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. However, her enemies forced her to flee and hide in [[Waterdeep]]. In the City of Splendors, Len-jes was contacted by [[Dagult Neverember]], who hired her to be the harbormaster of Neverwinter.

In 1479 DR, she became a semi-permanent resident of the [[Beached Leviathan]]. 

During the civil unrest caused by the supposed "[[Seldra Tylmarande|Lost Heir]] of [[Alagondar]]", Len-jes took sides with Neverember's loyalists.

==Rumors==
People were unsure of Len-jes true allegiances. Many believed she was working undercover for the [[Thay]]ans, the [[Ashmadai]], or for [[pirate]]s from [[Laerakond]], while others believed she was a [[Harper agent]] instead. For other people, however, she was just a power-hungry lackey of Neverember.
