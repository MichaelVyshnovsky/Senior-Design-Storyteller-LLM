        "mainbody": "ngot was a gnoll bandit who once dwelt in the Gnoll Stronghold on the Sword Coast, to the south-west from Nashkel in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIngot carried a unique enchanted halberd - the Chesley Crusher.\nBefore 1368 DR, Ingot, along with his gnoll tribe, occupied the old abandoned keep on the coast that came to be known as the Gnoll Stronghold. In 1368 DR, the gnolls of the stronghold captured Dynaheir, a Rashemaar wychlaran. Ingot expressed a desire to roast the witch and taste her flesh instead of keeping her in the strongholds cellars. As a result, he was banished by his fellow gnolls. Embittered, Ingot wandered the area of the Dryad Falls to the strongholds east and encouraged adventurers to conquer the Gnoll Stronghold."
