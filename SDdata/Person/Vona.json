        "mainbody": "Vona the Black was a mysterious dragonborn member of Clan Vkriss in 1479 DR.\nLittle was known about Vona the Black. Many believed \"Vona\" was a title given to female dragonborn members of Clan Vkriss rather than a name. The individual who had earned the title became the leader of the assassins of the clan.\nIt was unknown whether the Vona who lived in 1479 DR was the same person as the first woman who took the title, as nobody who met her lived to tell the tale."
