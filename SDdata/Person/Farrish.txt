Farrish was a priest of Lathander in Freedale during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was an old man.
Farrish was described as kind and gentle.
He could cast spells.
Of note, he had chain mail and a mace.
He cast spells for money at the Temple of Lathander to help with the upkeep. He would not do this for the malevolent or false, however.
He was the master of Lordan the Pure, and would have a place of succor and healing for him as long as Lordan remained in good standing with their shared beliefs.
Farrish had built the Temple of Lathander in Freedale on his own, over the years.
