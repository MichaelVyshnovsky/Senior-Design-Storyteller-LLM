'''Grit''' was a [[half-dwarf]] [[half-orc]] rogue of [[Clan Ironeater]] residing in [[Illefarn]] around [[1480 DR]].

==Relationship==
Grit was the son of the [[dwarf]] [[Thord Ironaxe]], who was one of the few [[dwarves]] to fall in love with an [[orc]], [[Tulug]]. Grit did not much like his parents, especially his mother.

==History==
Around 1480 DR, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Arvik Zaltos]] asked for volunteers for a mission outside. Grit proposed himself, immediately followed by his father Thord.

So Arvik instructed Thord Ironaxe, his son Grit, and the [[ogrillon]] [[Lump]] to go to [[Daggerford]] to help his apprentice [[Darwa Dalion]] to recover the [[earth key]] from inside the [[Ambergul Crypt]].

However, when Darwa, Thord, and the others found the altar to [[Ogremoch]], she tried to unlock the earth key by force and a magical trap turned her into stone.

So Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some [[minotaur]]s who wanted cook and eat him.

Only Lump and Grit returned to Illefarn with the earth key.

After giving the key to the Red Wizards, Grit went to his room to listen to a singing stone he had recently found at [[Laughing Hollow]].

==Personality==
Grit basically hated everyone in his life: he did not consider himself like other [[half-orc]]s because it was like looking in a mirror, he disliked the orcs that wanted him to become a fighter, and disliked the dwarves because they tried to expel the orcs from Illefarn. Grit dreamed of leaving Illefarn and seeing the world.
