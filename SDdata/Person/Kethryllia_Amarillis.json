        "mainbody": "'''Kethryllia Amarillis''' also known as '''Flame-Flower''' was a [[moon elf]] who founded [[House Amarillis]]. Her body resided in the [[Hall of the Ancients]] in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]]. She lived long before the [[Crown Wars]] as the [[archmage]] of [[Sharlarion]]. When the city was attacked by an [[orc]] horde, she lead its army in battle. Two nights before that she finished in creating the [[Magic|magical]] sword [[Dharasha]] and she took the [[dagger]] with her, which centuries before was a gift from [[Ka'Narlist]] for [[Cornaith Moonflower]]. During the battle she fought together with her consort [[Anarallath]]. It was this [[Cleric|priest]] who banished the leader of the orc horde, the [[demon]] [[Haeshkarr]]. Before the demon was thrown back to the [[abyss]] he got hold of the priest and took him with him. Kethryllia followed them and landed in the [[Demonweb Pits]]. She fought the minions of [[Haeshkarr]] and met the goddess [[Kiaransalee]]. The [[evil]] [[Deity|goddess]] was intrigued by the wish for revenge and helped her to find [[Haeshkarr]] and her lost love, if she would only hail to [[Corellon Larethian]] for each kill. At least she managed to kill the hunted demon and freed [[Anarallath]]. But [[Lolth]] was aware of her doings and she followed Kythryllia to [[Faer√ªn]], where she began to gather new followers, the [[dark elves]].",
