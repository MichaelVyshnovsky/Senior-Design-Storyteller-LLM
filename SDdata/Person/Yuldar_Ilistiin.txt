'''Yuldar Ilistiin''' was a young [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He grew a beard and wore the robes of a druid.

==Activities==
Originally from [[Tethyr]] where he was forced to flee for his life because of his blood relation to Lord [[Ilistiin]], Yuldar was newly arrived in Waterdeep as of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. He initially dressed as a druid to disguise himself, but Yuldar discovered a childhood love of nature while doing so that lead him to the shrine of Silvanus where he sought guidance. Yuldar was advised to explore the north with a band of [[adventurer]]s in order to hear Silvanus' calling for him.

By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, he had returned to Tethyr after being convinced by then-Prince [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] to support his claim for the throne.
