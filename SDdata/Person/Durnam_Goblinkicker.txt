The [[dwarf]] '''Durnam Goblinkicker''' was the owner of the [[Laughing Goblin Inn]] in [[Phlan]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|9}} 

==Personality==
For a while Durnam was mostly absent from his inn, leaving the day-to-day operations to his employee [[Imizael]]. He was forced to take a more hands-on leadership after Imizael's departure during the events of the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], which left him quite grumpy.{{Cite adventurers league/Escape from Phlan|8}}

==History==
When his city was taken over by [[Vorgansharax]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Durnam was one of the few business owners who secretly rebelled against the [[dragon]].
