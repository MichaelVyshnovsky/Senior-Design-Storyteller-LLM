Lord '''Rivior''' was a bandit leader who commissioned [[dwarves]] to construct what would later become known as the [[Haunted Halls]] near the village of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Activities==
Rivior lived during the 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was slain by [[Enchara]] of [[Esparin]] when she tricked him and his starving followers into leaving the safety of the Haunted Halls during the heart of winter.

Roughly two-hundred years later, in [[1348 DR]], the [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Swords of Eveningstar]] found a collection of unused [[Potion of healing|healing potions]] hidden inside the Haunted Halls that were addressed to Rivior.{{Cite digital book/Swords of Eveningstar}}
