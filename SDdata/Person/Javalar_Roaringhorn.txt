'''Javalar Roaringhorn''' was the leader of the [[Knights of the Unicorn]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name="PaP-p39" >

==Activities==
Javalar led a group of [[adventurer]]s during the exploration of the [[elven]] castle of [[El'lahana Raikeil]] deep within the [[Moonwood]]. After discovering and experimenting with the ''[[Crown of Joy and Tears]]'', Javalar exited the castle in the moonlight and declared "May none again find the ''Crown of Joy and Tears'' unless they enter with the heart of a child and the laugh of a [[dryad]] or wish to regain that which they have lost." Intrigued by these events, an [[avatar]] of [[Lurue]] appeared and took the adventurers on an exhilarating ride through the forest with her [[Silver Herd]]. The group chose to name themselves the Knights of the Unicorn in Lurue's honor and pledged their service to the Unicorn Queen.

Following the [[Time of Troubles]], Javalar became a commander of one of the bands of the [[Order of the Unicorn]], one of several smaller bands split from the Knights of the Unicorn with the hopes of doing good deeds over a larger area.
