Fernigold the Younger was a naive adventurer and son of a fishmonger from Daggerford, Fernigold the Older circa 1372 DR.
Fernigold the Younger was a naive and foolishly brave according to his father.
Fernigold the Younger was a son of a simple fishmonger who was not content with the life of hard labor. Along with his two mischievous halfling friends, Rugmax and Klevtor, Fernigold the Younger was pestering trades, caravaners, and adventurers for old maps, scrolls, and letters that possibly contained information of long lost riches.
In 1372 DR, Fernigold the Younger came across a scroll talking about an ancient ruler Telarthirs tomb. The map was fake, a practical joke that Rugmax and Klevtor played on naive Fernigold. They did not expect the young man to actually pursue the treasure and just did it to make some coin off of him. The fake map led to a waterfall in the area to the east from Liams Hold.
Surprisingly enough, the "fake" map turned out to be real and led the ambitious youth to Brush of Barbs and into Telarthirs tomb. However, Fernigold perished soon after he entered the crypt. He was slain by the undead guardians. Subsequently, his body was discovered by the Hero of Daggerford who was asked to find the missing young man. When Fernigolds body was discovered, his flesh was gaunt and his face was frozen in a grimace of terror. The youths body was retrieved and returned to the the boys grieving father.
