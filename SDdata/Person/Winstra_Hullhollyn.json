Ravengard was quite the dullard. I hope the new Archduke throws more parties than Ravengard. He was too serious for my liking.''|Lady Winstra Hullhollyn}}",
        "Description": "Winstra Hullhollyn was a [[human]] woman with dusky skin. She wore a diadem atop styled arm drown hair. The lady wore a tight embroidered blue blouse and quality [[leather]] pants.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, shortly before the armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lady Winstra Hullhollyn was a Parliamentarian of the Gate and voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the city's Archduke. Lady Hullhollyn was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of [[Wyrm's Rock]]. Following the coronation, Lady Winstra Hullhollyn conversed with a fellow Parliamentarian Lord [[Randolf Vammas]], lamenting cancelations of social events die to the armies of the [[Absolute]] advancing on the Gate. She believed that the new Archduke would be a more fun leader and a charismatic, unlike boring old [[Ulder Ravengard]]."
