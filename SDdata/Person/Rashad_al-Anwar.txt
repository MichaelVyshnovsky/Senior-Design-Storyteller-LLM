Rashad al-Anwar was an unskilled halfling shair who relied on his gen to keep him out of trouble. He traveled Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Rashad dressed like a typical Zakharan, wearing a long aba. He carried a jambiya and a small staff.
Rashads lack of practical knowledge regarding his chosen profession was evident in his words and actions. His gen Sallah needed to constantly correct him. Rashads lack of guile landed him into trouble with influential people during a trip to Qudra.
