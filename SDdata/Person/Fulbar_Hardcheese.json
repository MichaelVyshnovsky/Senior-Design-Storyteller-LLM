        "History": "Fulbar was an adventurer in his youth. He settled down in Daggerford after he acquired a [[dragon]]'s hoard buried deep under his tavern. Thanks to this treasure, Fulbar became a kind of landlord, with considerable holdings in [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Neverwinter]] and a farm just outside Daggerford managed by his son [[Dickon Hardcheese]].\n\nHis tavern, called the [[Happy Cow]], was located in north Daggerford near the [[Farmer's Gate]] along [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] and the [[Farmer's Road]]. His home was the neighboring building to the south of the tavern.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}\n\nHe wanted to become a quiet power in the [[North]] but unknown to him he was watched by the [[Lords' Alliance]], the [[Harpers]], and, from 1370 DR, also the [[Zhentarim]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], Fulbar Hardcheese could most frequently be seen behind the bar of the Happy Cow, while his partner [[Demetira Landscraper]] was handling more daily activities, such as purchasing, inventory, and accounting, as well as being a tireless advertiser of Fulbar's [[Knee-Cracker]] [[cider]]."
