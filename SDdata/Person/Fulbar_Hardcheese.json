        "mainbody": "Fulbar Hardcheese was a strongheart halfling tavern owner in Daggerford around 1370 DR. \nFulbar was ashamed of his former life as a thief.\nFulbars normal wear was typically a shirt, trews, and a taverners apron.\nHe possessed a set studded leather armor, a ring of chameleon power, a ring of feather falling, and a unique enchanted, sentient shortsword named Quietstrike.\nFulbar was an adventurer in his youth. He settled down in Daggerford after he acquired a dragons hoard buried deep under his tavern. Thanks to this treasure, Fulbar became a kind of landlord, with considerable holdings in Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter and a farm just outside Daggerford managed by his son Dickon Hardcheese.\nHis tavern, called the Happy Cow, was located in north Daggerford near the Farmers Gate along Wall Street and the Farmers Road. His home was the neighboring building to the south of the tavern.\nHe wanted to become a quiet power in the North but unknown to him he was watched by the Lords Alliance, the Harpers, and, from 1370 DR, also the Zhentarim.\nCirca 1372 DR, Fulbar Hardcheese could most frequently be seen behind the bar of the Happy Cow, while his partner Demetira Landscraper was handling more daily activities, such as purchasing, inventory, and accounting, as well as being a tireless advertiser of Fulbars Knee-Cracker cider."
