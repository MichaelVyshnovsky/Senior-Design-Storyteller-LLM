'''Malimak''' was a whimsical [[mage]] who lived some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Malimak was known for creating a ''[[wand of wonder]]'' to be presented as a prank gift to his rival. It was unknown if anything harmful came out of it, but Malimak quickly relocated soon after the ''wand of wonder'' was gifted. The ''wand'' eventually ended up in the [[illithid]] lair underneath [[Athkatla]]'s [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
