        "Description": "Z'rell kept her hair in plaits that ran back along her head. She lost her right eye, and had a large scar running down that side of her face.",
        "Personality": "She was exceptionally intelligent and had a mind like a steel trap.",

        "Activities": "Z'rell directly served [[Ketheric Thorm]], [[chosen]] of the Absolute, at the cult's outpost of [[Moonrise Towers]].",
        "History": "At some point, Z'rell visited the [[Shattered Sanctum]], one of the strongholds maintained by the cult of the Absolute. Z'rell \"complimented\" its [[goblin]] members, saying they may not be worthless if they killed [[human]]s as well as they chased [[chicken]]s. This garnered Z'rell the affections of [[Klagga]], a goblin raider with a stumpy leg and a bad eye.\n\nUnder the orders from Ketheric Thorm, Z'rell handpicked an envoy to establish contact with the [[Shadow Druids]] â€“ an important tool in distracting, weakening, and corrupting the [[Emerald Grove]] and the [[Cloak Wood]] [[druidic circle]]s. Z'rell's pick was to coerce, threaten, and bribe the Shadow Druids, and eventually, infecting them with illithid tadpoles."
