'''Varriel''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
In 1479 DR, Varriel discovered notes about a [[necromancer]]'s laboratory inside [[Undermountain]]. Not suited for adventure, she hired [[Aizel Treemaine]], a female [[elf]] wizard, to explore on her behalf. However, Aizel joined the doomed [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]]'s party and disappeared. Soon after, some [[undead]] with a symbol associated with the laboratory started wandering the dungeon. So Varriel decided to hire a second adventuring party in order to uncover the matter.
