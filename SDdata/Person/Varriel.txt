Varriel was a Red Wizard of Thay in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, Varriel discovered notes about a necromancers laboratory inside Undermountain. Not suited for adventure, she hired Aizel Treemaine, a female elf wizard, to explore on her behalf. However, Aizel joined the doomed Rutherford Urmbrusks party and disappeared. Soon after, some undead with a symbol associated with the laboratory started wandering the dungeon. So Varriel decided to hire a second adventuring party in order to uncover the matter.
