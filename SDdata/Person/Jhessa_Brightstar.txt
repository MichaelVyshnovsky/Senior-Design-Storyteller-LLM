'''Jhessa Brightstar''' was a [[priest]] of [[Lathander]] in the town of [[Idyllglen]].

==Description==
A descendant of [[Solndor Brightstar]], Jhessa was just as dutiful and humble a servant of Lathander.

==History==
Jhessa was present in Idyllglen when it was nearly entirely destroyed by [[Yeenoghu]] and his band of [[gnoll]]s and [[demon]]s. She led her congregation in prayer, imploring Lathander to send the [[angel]] [[Zariel]] to save the town as she did once before.
