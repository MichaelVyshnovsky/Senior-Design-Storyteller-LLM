'''Alastra Hathwinter''' was a wizard in [[Longsaddle]].

==History==
In her youth, Alastra was a wide-wandering adventurer: she went from [[Nimbral]] to [[Malatra]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and from [[Zakhara]] in the distant south to the castles of the [[cloud giant]]s above the endless ice of the [[North]]. Finally, Alastra settled in Longsaddle near her friend [[Auglyth Harpell]].

Alastra opened a festhall in the village and continued her business even after Auglyth died in [[1358 DR]].

She was rumored to be a [[Harper]] or a Harper ally.

Alastra resurfaced around [[1487 DR]] as a fully Harper, and secret lover of [[Malchor Harpell]], and competed with other archmages for the possession of the [[Lost Spell]] during a [[spellstorm]]. Alastra was however killed by [[Maraunth Torr]].
