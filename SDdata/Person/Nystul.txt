{{quote|We bled [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|His Majesty]], then enchanted the blood we collected. A simple spell–''Nystul's magic aura''–that would just turn the blood magical. Except, of course, the parts of the blood surrounded by ''[[dead-magic zone]]s''.|[[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]]}}

==Description==
Nystul's true appearance was hidden even from his fellow members of the Circle of Eight. At the age of forty-three years old, Nystul was a plain-looking, lanky man who weighed {{SI|184|lb|k|long=yes}}, a noticeably lightweight for someone {{SI|6'7''|ft|long=yes}} tall. He had messy, lank hair of pale brown and brown eyes.

==Personality==
Nystul had a sharp and unerring mind but also was a lover of tactics, jokes, and puns.{{Cite dragon/405/History Check: Rary the Traitor|2}} Using magic, Nystul often took on the guise of a fair elven maid when traveling, knowing that brave knights and stalwart paladins eagerly offered protection to such a delicate creature. He believed that a mage was never to meet an enemy in close combat, preferring greatly to control the battlefield with illusory magics.

==Relationships ==
Nystul's group, which included [[Mordenkainen]], [[Otto]], Rary, [[Drawmij]], [[Otiluke]], [[Bigby]], and [[Tenser]], was known as the famed Circle of Eight. Nystul's jokes and puns proved to be quite an annoyance to Mordenkainen, Bigby, and Drawmij.{{Cite dragon/296/Living Greyhawk Journal|108}} [[Dwarf]] [[fighter]] from the Duchy of Tenh named Yars Blud-Sigul was Nystul's acquaintance and aided him against [[lich]] [[Vecna]].

==Possessions==
Nystul often carried such defensive magic items as ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', and a ''[[cloak of displacement]]''. However, he was armed only with a simple [[dagger]], which he seldomly used for anything but peeling an [[apple]]. Other wondrous items in Nystul's possession were ''[[boots of levitation]]'', ''[[dust of disappearance]]'', a ''[[hat of disguise]]'', a ''[[helm of telepathy]]'', a ''[[wand of enemy detection]]'', a ''[[wand of illusion]]'', and a ''[[wand of illumination]]''. As an additional method of protection, Nystul was always under the effects of a permanent ''[[protection from evil]]'' spell.

==Activities==

Nystul was known for creating a number of spells, ''[[Nystul's magic aura]]'' and ''[[Nystul's undetectable aura]]'' being extremely common and found on many worlds, and ''[[Nystul's nullifier]]'' was a spell used by law enforcement of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]]. ''[[Nystul's crystal dirk]]'' was brought to Toril in the late 14{{th}} century DR from a cross the planes by the [[Order of the Eternals]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Impendant Symposium|27-28}}

Other spells, unknown on [[Toril]], included ''Nystul's blacklight burst'', ''Nystul's blackmote'', ''Nystul's blazing beam'', ''Nystul's crystal dagger'', ''Nystul's dancing werelight'', ''Nystul's enveloping darkness'', ''Nystul's expeditious fire extinguisher'', ''Nystul's flash'', ''Nystul's golden revelation'', ''Nystul's grue conjuration'', ''Nystul's lightburst'', ''Nystul's magical mask'',{{Cite dragon/229/Illusions of Grandeur|23}} ''Nystul's radiant arch'', and ''Nystul's radiant baton.''{{Cite dragon/175/Sage Advice|76}}

Apart from spellcrafting, Nystul also penned the ''Libram of the Great Paravisual Emanations'', which contained a variety of spells, including that of his own making,{{Cite dragon/82/Spells between the covers|58}} as well as ''The Metaphysics of Mathematics''.

==History==
Nystul was born to a wealthy noble family in the capital city of the Duchy of Tenh. In later years, Nystul showed concern for his homeland and often felt others did not show enough concern for the Duchy of Ten. He spent much of his time collecting intel on the goings-on at Tenh's borders, supplying it to the country's rulers without asking for accolades or recognition.
