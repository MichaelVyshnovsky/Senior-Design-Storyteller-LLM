        "mainbody": "'''Najim''' was a [[djinni]] and [[slave]] of [[Baeloth Barrityl]].",
        "Description": "The djinni Najim was bound by an undying ''[[geas]]'' in service to Baeloth. He sympathized with the combatants of the [[Black Pits]], but could not aid them in escaping and killing the pit master, due to the ''geas''.",
        "History": "When the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits|leader of a new party]] was summoned to the pits, Najim told them of their misfortune, and was forced to give them spending money to purchase fighting equipment. After the champion had defeated Baeloth in the final battle, Najim came to the arena and opened up a portal for the victors. They took the portal, and arrived on the surface.\n\nAfter the party had won their freedom, Najim overheard that [[bounty hunter]]s were after them. However, when he went to inform them, they had fallen into a trap and were sent to [[Dennaton]]'s fighting arena."
