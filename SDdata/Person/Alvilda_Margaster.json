        "Relationship": "Alvilda was the cousin of Lady [[Inkeri Margaster]].",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1488}}, the [[halfling]] [[rogue]] [[Regis]] met Alvilda and Lady [[Inkeri Margaster]] at the [[Driftwood Tavern]] near [[Neverwinter]]. The Margasters held a party there and during the dances Regis gained from his dance partner Alvilda some useful information about Inkeri's plots.\n\nLater that year, Alvilda gave birth to a baby girl named [[Charon|Sharon]], who appeared somehow corrupted, perhaps as a result of the family's trade in [[demon]]ic [[phylactery|phylacteries]], Their conflict came to a head when Alvilda and Inkeri managed to capture Regis and [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], who had infiltrated the Margaster estate in [[Waterdeep]]. Instigated by Sharon, the two cousins fully transformed into demons and fought each other, until Alvilda beheaded Inkeri."
