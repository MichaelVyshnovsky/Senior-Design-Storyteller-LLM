'''Sressa''' was an [[erinyes]] in service to [[Tasnya]] in the mid-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sressa was commanded by [[Tasnya]] to watch over [[Elminster Aumar]] while he was captured by [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]], and fetch the human if possible. An erinyes later attempted to snatch Elminster during [[Mystra]]'s own scouring of [[Avernus]], accidentally shielding him from collateral damage at the cost of her own life. That erinyes may or may not have been Sressa.
