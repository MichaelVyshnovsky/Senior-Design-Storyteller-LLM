'''Sibonseni''', known as '''Mother Sibonseni''' or the '''Mother of Prosperity''', was the chief [[priest]] of [[Waukeen]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was a prominent and revered figure who held a great amount of influence among the city's residents. She was also one of the city's wealthiest citizens.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|12}}

{{Quote|I am not one to venture far from the city.|Sibonseni}}

==Description==
Mother Sibonseni was a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] [[noble]]woman{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|48}} with heavy-lidded eyes{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|15}} who was often surrounded by entertainers and servants. She was known to wear a [[silver]] [[tiara]] inset with [[moonstone]] and to have a [[silk]] [[handbag]] in which she carried [[Bo Bo]], a [[toy terrier]]. She wrote her correspondences using rare and expensive [[ink]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|36}}

==Personality==
She was a big lover of music and other entertainment, hence she surrounded herself with dancers, [[drum]]mers, singers, fire-swallowers, and [[snake]] charmers.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|14}}

==Activities==
From the [[Hall of Gold]] temple, Mother Sibonseni arranged charitable events and projects that helped improved conditions within the city. When she traveled through the streets, she did so in an opulent [[sedan chair]], accompanied by musicians and assistants that distributed alms to the city's poor citizens. Despite the traffic this created, she was much beloved for her charity.

In addition to her religious and charitable activities, Mother Sibonseni operated her temple as one of Port Nyanzaru's largest banks. Such was her influence that she was known to negotiate trade deals directly with the [[Lords' Alliance]]. Such business meetings were often held in a private office in her villa.

She furthermore maintained the single largest army of mercenaries out of any individual within Port Nyanzaru.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|35}}

==Possessions==
[[File:PN map - Sibonseni villa.png|thumb|250px|''Location of Sibonseni's villa on Temple Hill.''<ref group="note">This location is taken from the [[Adventurers League]] module ''[[Peril at the Port]]'', however the map in this adventure indicates two different locations for Sibonseni's villa. The location marked aligns most closely with the villa's description in the text of that adventure, specifically the emphasis on exterior walls enclosing the villa and its gardens. The alternative location was further north, and is the first building on the left within the walls entering Temple Hill from the [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]].]]
She lived in a grand stone villa atop [[Temple Hill]] in the city's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]], with high ceilings and windows, polished [[marble]] floors, and [[teak]] doors. She kept her home filled with light&mdash;from [[oil lamp]]s and [[torch]]es&mdash;and with the fragrances of [[incense]] and of the jungle. The walls were adorned with [[taxidermy|stuffed]] [[dinosaur]] heads, [[silver]] [[cage]]s containing red [[sorcery crow]]s, Chultan relics and stone tablets, [[map]]s, and polished [[cabinet]]s containing Chultan antiques, [[spear]]s, and [[mask (object)|masks]] as well as chunks of [[meteorite]]s. Twin staircases led to a second floor from the entrance hall, and a complete [[tyrannosaurus]] skeleton stood between them. The villa itself was surrounded by lush gardens&mdash;filled with [[lime]] and [[palm tree]]s as well as ornamental pools containing [[lilies]] and [[crocodile]]s. The gardens were in turn surrounded by a {{SIAdj|15|foot|long=yes|adj=high}} stone wall topped with shards of jagged [[glass]] to deter intruders.

Visitors to the villa entered through a [[iron|wrought iron]] gate and were searched for weapons before meeting with Sibonseni in an open atrium lit by hanging [[lantern]]s on painted columns surrounding a rectangular pool. The priestess sat upon a [[leopard]]skin [[divan]] and guests sat on cushions, where they were offered [[hookah]].

Within her villa's library, Sibonseni maintained an extensive collection of maps, [[almanac]]s, histories, and navigational charts of the perilous shipping lanes along Chult's [[Wild Coast]]. These were so valuable to foreign sailors and traders that she was able to use them as leverage in trade negotiations, much to the consternation of groups like the Lords' Alliance. Naturally, the most valuable pieces were kept in a locked [[chest]] outfitted with a [[trap]] designed to put out a [[thief]]'s eye.

==Relationships==
Sibonseni's popularity and influence transcended class divides, making her perhaps the most influential figure in Port Nyanzaru who was not among the seven [[Merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]]. However, some speculated that she aspired to join the princes' ranks, attracting the suspicions of at least some of them, notably [[Jessamine]] and [[Zhanthi]].

The master-at-arms of her personal mercenaries was [[Kwalu Mosi]]. Unbeknownst to her, he was actually loyal to the merchant prince Zhanthi.

She was owed a favor by the jungle guide [[Azaka Stormfang]].

==History==
Mother Sibonseni was involved in negotiating a trade agreement between Port Nyanzaru and [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.

}}
When the [[Running of the Saurs]] was held during the time of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} a group of pirates tried to take advantage of the chaos to rob the Hall of Gold. Their captain tried and failed to intimidate Mother Sibonseni.

When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the [[fiend]]ish pirates of Captain [[Idrianne Smoke]], Sibonseni refused to lend her mercenary army to the fight, claiming that the city's defense was the responsibility of the merchant princes. This prompted the princes to send agents to subvert her control over her troops and to mobilize them without her consent.
