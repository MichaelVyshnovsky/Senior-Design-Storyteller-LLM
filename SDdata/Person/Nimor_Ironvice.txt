Nimor Ironvice was a member of a group of duergar followers of Asmodeus under Fire-Speaker Kholzourl who mined hellthorn in the depths of Gauntlgrym around 1480 DR.
He scouted the surface and there Nimor met and befriend Mordai Vell, leader of the Ashmadai. Vell also wanted hellthorn, so Nimor started smuggling the mineral to the ashmadai for a very high price. He was very careful, knowing that Kholzourl would kill him if caught, but he hoped that Asmodeus would send a sign of approbation for his actions.
