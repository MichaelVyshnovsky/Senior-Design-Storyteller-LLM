        "mainbody": "'''Oraphelia Mayne''', nicknamed '''Burkins''' after an old family name, was a [[tiefling]] merchant who operated along the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15th century.",
        "Description": "Oraphelia was a red-skinned tiefling with long black hair and prominent red horns. She often wore ornate gold-embellished robes.",
        "Personality": "She had a sarcastic personality, and was not at all concerned about the morality of supplying pirates and criminals.",
        "History": "Oraphelia originally operated in [[Neverwinter]], but moved her business to [[Luskan]] sometime around [[1487 DR]], citing excessive competition in Neverwinter. She encountered the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] on her journey from Neverwinter to Luskan, and requested their aid in delivering a package that, unbeknownst to them, contained poison.\n\nShe was later warned by the Champion that a mysterious figure in the sewers had told them to let her know that her business was now being watched. She assumed the mysterious figure to be of [[Bregan D'aerthe]]."
