        "mainbody": "Oraphelia Mayne, nicknamed Burkins after an old family name, was a tiefling merchant who operated along the Sword Coast in the late 15th century.\nOraphelia was a red-skinned tiefling with long black hair and prominent red horns. She often wore ornate gold-embellished robes.\nShe had a sarcastic personality, and was not at all concerned about the morality of supplying pirates and criminals.\nOraphelia originally operated in Neverwinter, but moved her business to Luskan sometime around 1487 DR, citing excessive competition in Neverwinter. She encountered the Champion of the Burning Dawn on her journey from Neverwinter to Luskan, and requested their aid in delivering a package that, unbeknownst to them, contained poison.\nShe was later warned by the Champion that a mysterious figure in the sewers had told them to let her know that her business was now being watched. She assumed the mysterious figure to be of Bregan Daerthe."
