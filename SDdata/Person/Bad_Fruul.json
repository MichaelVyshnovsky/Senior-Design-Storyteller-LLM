        "History": "At some point after the rise of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their attempted summoning of [[Tiamat]]{{ToD-time}}, Bad Fruul came into possession of the enchanted headband containing the soul of Narcellia Varam'myr. He wore the headband and increased his intelligence. From inside the headband, Narcellia began orchestrating Bad Fruul's rise to power.{{Cite adventurers league/Parnast Under Siege|5}}\n\nAfter the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] was broken, Bad Fruul called for other [[giant]]s and [[giant-kin]] to join his army. Upon hearing of this, all but five of the half-ogres who worked for [[Mama Manyknuckles]] deserted her and joined Fruul's army.\n\nHobgoblins, bugbears, and goblins working for Bad Fruul set up a crude gate on the [[Black Road]], two days out of [[Parnast]]. Under his banner, they charged tolls and attacked travelers. These goblinoids encountered a caravan of [[adventurer]]s led by [[Azam]], transporting a statue of [[Angharradh]] for the [[Shrine of Axes]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Black Road|12}}\n\nFruul also sent some hobgoblins to the [[Marsh of Chelimber]] to find the ruins of the [[Wizard of the Crag]]'s tower. He hoped to recover some powerful magic from there, but his hobgoblins were attacked and killed by a [[water weird]] that laired in the marsh.{{Cite adventurers league/Beneath the Fetid Chelimber|4}} In an attempt to protect Parnast from Bad Fruul, [[SEER]] of the [[Lords' Alliance]] tasked adventurers with recovering manuscripts from the ruins of the wizard's tower.{{Cite adventurers league/Chelimber's Descent|5}}\n\nFruul tried to bully his rival, the [[ettin]] [[Gralm]], into submission and to subsume his army. Azam sent adventurers from Parnast to convince Gralm not to join with Fruul.{{Cite adventurers league/Giant Diplomacy|4-6}}\n\nAs he amassed his armies to the south,{{Cite adventurers league/Bad Business in Parnast|4}} Fruul sent Kagrota Threeteeth to Parnast with a force of goblins, orcs, and ogres. She attacked farms, and captured Parnasters as slaves.{{Cite adventurers league/Bad Business in Parnast|7}}\n\nHowever, Fruul heard from these farmer slaves about the statue of Angharradh and [[Chandra Stol]], the priestess at the Shrine of Axes.{{Cite adventurers league/Parnast Under Siege|4}} Fruul was influenced by the soul of Narcellia Varam'myr that inhabited his headband. She suspected that Chandra was a relative of [[Luistarra Stollereil]], the one who imprisoned her in the headband. In response, Bad Fruul sent spies to Parnast and identified a pendant that Luistarra had owned now in the possession of Chandra. This confirmed the suspicions. Fruul resolved to attack Parnast, destroy the Shrine of Axes, and kill Chandra Stol.\n\nWhile Fruul organized his forces, SEER hired adventurers to protect Chandra and the town. Bad Fruul sent the captive Parnasters [[Mazzy]], [[Jarlor]], and [[Larrish]] back into Parnast as spies. He was holding their families captive to blackmail them into his service. He also sent a non-blackmailed [[half-orc]] spy from the Spine Ripper Clan. Meanwhile Gralm, aware that Bad Fruul was mounting an attack, was deciding whether to abstain from the fighting or attack Bad Fruul outright.\n\nAfter some days of preparation had passed, Bad Fruul began his attack on Parnast with a night raid. He sent orc devotees of [[Shargaas]] riding on [[giant bat]]s to the Shrine of Axes to capture Chandra. Following this, Bad Fruul, riding his mammoth, led his armies in a siege of Parnast."
