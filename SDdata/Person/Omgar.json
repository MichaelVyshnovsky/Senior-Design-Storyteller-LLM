        "Activities": "Omgar laired in a cave on the peninsula's southern tip in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Omgar exacted heavy tolls on passing ships depending on his mood. Most of the sailors would rather pay his toll that risk bypassing his lair and foundering on the [[Beacon Rocks]] nearby.",
        "History": "It was unknown what became of Omgar after the peninsula that bore his home was split apart from [[Chult]] following the [[Spellplague]], and transformed into an isle onto itself."
