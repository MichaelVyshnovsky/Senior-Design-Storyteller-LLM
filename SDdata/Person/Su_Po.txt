Su Po was a member of the Society of the Purple Lotus in Shou Lung.
As with all members of the Society of the Purple Lotus, Su Po wished to destroy the Mandarinate that ruled Shou Lung. He was seized by the Emperors agents for writing documents speaking out against the bureaucracy. He was found guilty of crimes against the state and sentenced to the Valley of Exiles. Only his distant blood relation to the Emperor saved him from harsher punishment.
Before committing his crimes, Su Po was a popular poet and scholar. Since his exile, the Emperor ordered that all of his written documents were to be destroyed.
