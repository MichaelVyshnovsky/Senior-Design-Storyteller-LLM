        "mainbody": "'''Harmantle''' was a shady merchant from [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, merchant Harmantle became involved in criminal tax evasion. [[Tathanter Doarmond]], a [[Wizard of War]] placed in charge of the investigation, was presented with two massive letters, one from Harmantle and another for a fellow merchant. Both letters heavily contradicted each other. The final discussion in the case was voiced by [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], the Royal Magician of Cormyr. Both merchants lied in their letters, however, Harmantle was the one sent to the dungeons."
