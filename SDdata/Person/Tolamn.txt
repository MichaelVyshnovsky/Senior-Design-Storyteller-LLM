Tolamn was a wizard from [[Shussel]] during the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. Between {{yearlink|1204}} and {{yearlink|1221}}, he went to a [[Magefair]] attended by the [[Magister]], [[Haelvar Ildagh]]; there, he attempted to attack the other mages, starting a brawl that was stopped by [[Azuth]] and [[Mystra]] themselves, ''[[feeblemind]]ing'' him and a couple other mages, then restoring to life and health all of their victims. This was shocking to the Magister.
