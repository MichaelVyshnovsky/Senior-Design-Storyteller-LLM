        "mainbody": "ady Jeanelle was a wealthy inhabitant and a member of the upper crust of the Jewel of the North, Neverwinter, in the late 14 century DR.\nLady Jeanelle was a middle-aged human woman who was still beautiful. According to people around her, she was a stunning beauty in her youth. She had blue eyes, fair skin tone, and blonde hair gathered in a proper bun. She always wore quality clothes.\nIn the , the city of Neverwinter was under martial law. Still, the bard of some renown named Finch managed to set up a huge performance in the Blacklake District, where Lady Jeanelle resided in her husbands mansion. A short while before the performance of a lifetime, Finch performed at Lady Jeanelles estate, and afterward, slightly tipsy, Jeanelle patted him on the rump for a job well done. Her husband saw the scandalous deed and took it to mean more than it did. The end result was Finch had his martial law pass papers suspended, unable to reenter Neverwinter.\nSoon after, Finch made acquittance with a group of adventurers who worked with the merchant SaSani of Crossroad Keep and persuaded them to try and get his papers restored. As a payment, Finch offered his services to the group as well as offering to immortalize their journey as only a professional bard could. Whilst with the adventurers, Finch may have had his papers reinstated at the request of Ser Nevalle after the adventurers convinced Lady Jeanelle, who frequented Tyrs Eye plaza near The Wailing Wench Tavern, to speak in favor of Finch and against her husband in court, and allowing Finch to perform in Neverwinter once again."
