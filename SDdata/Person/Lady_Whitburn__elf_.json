        "mainbody": "'''Lady Whitburn''' was the [[high elven]] wife of [[Lord Whitburn]], a member of a [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Old lady Whitburn, the mother-in-law, never comes down to the Lower City. I'm glad I'm not such a snob.''|Lady Whitburn}}",
        "Description": "Lady Whitburn was a pale-skinned woman with delicate elfin features, straight blond hair, and icy blue eyes. She could often be seen wearing embroidered finery, such as tailored jackets, undercoats, and trousers.",
        "History": "Lady Whitburn married into the [[Whitburn]] patriar family sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lord Whitburn received a hefty inheritance, presumably after the death of old Lord Whitburn, who was survived by Madeline's mother-in-law â€“ Old Lady Whitburn. During the same period of time, Lady Madeline Whitburn was known to frequent the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], hunting for fanciful hats, like those worn by her dear friend [[Penni]]."
