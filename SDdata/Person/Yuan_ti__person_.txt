Yuan ti was the commanding officer of the Shou soldiers stationed at the Ginger Palace on the Dragon Coast of Faer√ªn.
A young man while in service to the empire, Yuan had a rounded face that had not hardened with age.
He was a dutiful and obedient soldier, willing to carry out any orders given to him by Shou nobility.
Like his fellow soldiers, Yuan wore scale mail armor and gold-trimmed helmet that resembled the shell of a tortoise, and wielded a long halberd in battle.
Yuan was tasked with defending Prince Kao Chou Tang, son of Lady Feng and Emperor Kao Tsao Shou Tang.
The young officer received his cushy position at the Ginger Palace from direction of his father, General Fui Dhang.
In the , Yuan accompanied his father and Prince Tang on an expedition into the nameless swamp near the Ginger Palace, in order to slay the dracolich Hethcypressarvil. During the journey along the waters of the swamp, Tang ordered the execution of General Fui on grounds of insubordination, which was inadvertently brought on by the consumption of lasal leaves. Not recognizing Yuan at first, Tang directed the young officer to slay his own father. When Yuan hesitated, Fui himself ordered his son to follow the princes commands, as they were considered wholly unquestionable. Yuan carried out the task and continued to follow the prince for the rest of the mission.
The rest of the expedition just as disastrous, as all of the Shou soldiers were slain and and their corpses scattered across the swamp. Yuans exact fate was unknown.
