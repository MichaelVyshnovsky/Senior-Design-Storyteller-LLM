|Helayna}}

==Description==
Helayna had pale grayish skin and black hair. She had half of her hair shaven, and the rest set in dreadlocks. She also had some [[tattoo]]ed designs on the right side of her face, ring piercings along the bridge of her nose, and a piercing beneath her lower lip. She wore light armor and a [[buckler]], and carried a pair of serrated [[dagger]]s.

==Personality==
Helayna had a rather flat and stoic manner, not showing much emotion.

==History==

|Oh, we were ambushed by a large party of kobolds. They were a lot tougher than we expected them to be, and had access to magics I never would've expected them to be able to use. It was, rather embarrassing, actually.
|Helayna}}
Around the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Helayna and her friends [[Popkin Shortshanks]], [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Liantor Stoneborn]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], and [[Tristran of Daggerford]] discovered an [[Netherese tomb|ancient tomb]] at the bottom of a crevasse in the [[Stonelands]]. They initially fought their way past some [[undead]] inhabitants, then discovered a hidden passage leading into deeper caves. After passing deeper underground, the group was ambushed by the [[kobold]]s of [[Clan Daeronnax]], whose sudden attack separated the members. Popkin alone escaped to the surface and returned to [[Eveningstar]] to get assistance.

After losing her comrades, Helayna scouted the tunnels in search for the rest of her group, but didn't meet any success. Thanks to Popkin's actions, Helayna was among the survivors recovered by a second party of adventurers who were able to use ''[[word of recall]]''-imbued trinkets to instantly send her to safety in Eveningstar.
