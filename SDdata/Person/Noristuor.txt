}}'''Noristuor''' was a [[tiefling]] [[wizard]] who took up residence in the city of [[Ashabenford]], some time before [[1372 DR]], in order to further his [[magic]]al research. He was known around town for his frightening appearance, caustic temperament and profane response whenever he was interrupted by townsfolk.

Although he wasn't well-liked by the folk of [[Mistledale]] he did on occasion lend his efforts to magically aid them and the city.
