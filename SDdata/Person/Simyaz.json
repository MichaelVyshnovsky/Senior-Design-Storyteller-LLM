        "History": "The silver blade was passed onto the sailor [[Saemon Havarian]], who knew it could only bring trouble and was anxious to be rid of it. Simyaz's group went after him in a [[levitate|levitating]] ship, but it was somehow capsized, possibly by the same [[sahuagin]] who may have attacked Havarian's ship. Simyaz and a few other githyanki ended up taken prisoners by the [[illithid]]s living near [[Ust Natha]], forced to fight for their amusement.",
        "Rumors": "It was rumored that [[Gorion's Ward]] encountered Simyaz and his group at sea upon [[Saemon Havarian]]'s ship, [[the Galante]]. They wished to come aboard his ship and sail out after Irenicus. The githyanki may have attacked the ship, and were interrupted by sahuagin sinking it.\n\nThe other time Simyaz may have been encountered by the party of Gorion's Ward was in the illithid caverns near [[Ust Natha]]. Both parties found themselves captured and were put into adjacent prison cells. Simyaz offered to cooperate with Gorion's Ward to escape from the illithids. The ward's party was set to fight the in the illithid's pit. The githyanki teleported out and left the party to fight the mind flayers.\n\nIt was further rumored that Gorion's Ward had obtained the Silver Sword, and Simyaz's group faced them for the final time in the main cavern outside the illithid compound. There, Gorion's Ward was given an option to simply relinquish the blade, but the githyanki may have still decided to attack."
