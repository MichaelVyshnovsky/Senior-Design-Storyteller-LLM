The '''Spider that Waits''' was a [[demon]] that had been bound by the [[wizard]]s of [[Almraiven]] in the [[Plain of Stone Spiders]] since the [[Time of Troubles]].

==History==
The Spider had previously been banished to the [[Abyss]] for one thousand years by an Almraiven wizard.

The demon constantly strained to break its bonds but was unable to do so. In [[1479 DR]], the [[Alzhedo dictionary#V|vizar]] of Almraiven, [[Munaa el Jhotos|Munaa yr Oma el Jhotos]], loosened the bonds so that the Spider could track [[Corvus Nightfeather]].	

==Description==
The Spider that Waits had a bloated body and many eyes.
