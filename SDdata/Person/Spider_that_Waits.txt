The Spider that Waits was a demon that had been bound by the wizards of Almraiven in the Plain of Stone Spiders since the Time of Troubles.
The Spider had previously been banished to the Abyss for one thousand years by an Almraiven wizard.
The demon constantly strained to break its bonds but was unable to do so. In 1479 DR, the vizar of Almraiven, Munaa yr Oma el Jhotos, loosened the bonds so that the Spider could track Corvus Nightfeather.	
The Spider that Waits had a bloated body and many eyes.
