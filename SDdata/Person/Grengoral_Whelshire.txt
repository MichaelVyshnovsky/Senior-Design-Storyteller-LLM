'''Grengoral Whelshire''' was the leader and co-founder of [[Perfectone Mercantile]], based in [[Longsaddle]] in [[north Faerûn]], in the 1360s DR.

==History==
Grengoral was an adventurer who retired to become a merchant. He worked for six years with the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] but grew bored of losing around almost a third of his goods to bandits and having his salary docked because of it. So he went to his friend, the mage [[Samuel Longspeak]] in Longsaddle, to propose an idea for a new kind of business: transporting goods with magic from one city to another. Samuel thoroughly approved of the idea and recruited other mages in different cities to form a network that ''[[teleport]]ed'' goods and people between some prominent cities in [[Faerûn]].

In [[Flamerule]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Grengoral and Samuel were kidnapped and killed by the [[Night Masks]] while in [[Westgate]] to solve problems with recent deliveries. The [[Wagonwheel Cloak Society]] was behind the plot to bring down Perfectone Mercantile, and they were successful—the company collapsed when its leaders could not be found.
