Grengoral Whelshire was the leader and co-founder of Perfectone Mercantile, based in Longsaddle in north Faerûn, in the 1360s DR.
Grengoral was an adventurer who retired to become a merchant. He worked for six years with the Seven Suns Trading Coster but grew bored of losing around almost a third of his goods to bandits and having his salary docked because of it. So he went to his friend, the mage Samuel Longspeak in Longsaddle, to propose an idea for a new kind of business transporting goods with magic from one city to another. Samuel thoroughly approved of the idea and recruited other mages in different cities to form a network that teleported goods and people between some prominent cities in Faerûn.
In Flamerule of the , Grengoral and Samuel were kidnapped and killed by the Night Masks while in Westgate to solve problems with recent deliveries. The Wagonwheel Cloak Society was behind the plot to bring down Perfectone Mercantile, and they were successful—the company collapsed when its leaders could not be found.
