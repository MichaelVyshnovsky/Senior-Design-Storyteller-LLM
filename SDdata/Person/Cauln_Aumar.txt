'''Cauln Aumar''' was a [[wizard]] and the third of the Warring Princes of [[Athalantar]] in the early 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|27,28}}

==Relations==
Cauln was the third eldest of the seven sons of King [[Uthgrael Aumar]] and Queen [[Syndrel Hornweather]]. Via his brother [[Elthryn Aumar|Elthryn]], the fourth, Cauln was the uncle of the infant [[Elminster]].

==Personality==
Cauln had a sour disposition and was suspicious and secretive in his habits. He had a natural affinity for magecraft and enjoyed watching wizards work magic.

==History==
Born in the {{YearlinkName|191}}, Cauln was tutored in [[magic]] by the court wizard [[Theskyn]]. He proved adept in the Art and rose swiftly in power. 

However, he was killed in the {{YearlinkName|217}}, by a [[Calishite]] wizard, [[Rhangaun]] of [[Almraiven]], whom his brother [[Elthaun Aumar]] had hired for the deed. Rhangaun baited Cauln into a [[spell]]-battle, and Cauln was not nearly as great a mage as he believed. Rhangaun turned Cauln into a [[snake]] and caused him to explode from within with an unidentified spell. [[Belaur Aumar]]'s [[magelord]]s slew Rhangaun in turn "for the safety of the realm". [[Helm Stoneblade]] told the young Elminster of Cauln and his other uncles years after.
