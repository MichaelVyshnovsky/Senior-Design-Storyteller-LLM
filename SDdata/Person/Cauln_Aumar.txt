Cauln Aumar was a wizard and the third of the Warring Princes of Athalantar in the early 3 century DR.
Cauln was the third eldest of the seven sons of King Uthgrael Aumar and Queen Syndrel Hornweather. Via his brother Elthryn, the fourth, Cauln was the uncle of the infant Elminster.
Cauln had a sour disposition and was suspicious and secretive in his habits. He had a natural affinity for magecraft and enjoyed watching wizards work magic.
Born in the , Cauln was tutored in magic by the court wizard Theskyn. He proved adept in the Art and rose swiftly in power. 
However, he was killed in the , by a Calishite wizard, Rhangaun of Almraiven, whom his brother Elthaun Aumar had hired for the deed. Rhangaun baited Cauln into a spell-battle, and Cauln was not nearly as great a mage as he believed. Rhangaun turned Cauln into a snake and caused him to explode from within with an unidentified spell. Belaur Aumars magelords slew Rhangaun in turn "for the safety of the realm". Helm Stoneblade told the young Elminster of Cauln and his other uncles years after.
