        "mainbody": "Gremma was an annis hag in Undermountain in 1375 DR.\nGremma resided with her four ogre minions in a small forest created by her powers inside Undermountain. Often, during enemy attacks, she disguised herself as an ogre. Gremma always empowered the ogres with her potions if she had the time.\nGremma, like her ogres, liked playing with her food—adventurers—before eating them. She preferred to attack unarmed because she liked tearing the adventurers apart with her claws and using her bare hands was easier.\nGremma possessed a magic cauldron."
