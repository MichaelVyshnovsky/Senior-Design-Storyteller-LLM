Merialeth "Merry" Loriamanthor was the elven owner of Merrys Mounts and More in Halfhap in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Merry was a fair elven maid.
Merry had a deep love of animals, and greatly valued their welfare.
Around 1369 DR, she operated her stables in Halfhap. It was known that she was interested in finding a romantic partner of the elven, human, or half-elven variety, with the stipulations that they respected animals and werent a druid.
At one point, Merry was harassed by a man while having dinner at the Marching Myrmidon, who suggested that the "and More" of her stables included certain disreputable services. He followed her home, continuing his harassment, until Merry reached home and shot him through the eye with her longbow. She was not arrested.
