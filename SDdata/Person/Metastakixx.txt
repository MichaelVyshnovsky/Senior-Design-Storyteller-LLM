'''Metastakixx''' was a strange creature that was created as a sentient guardian untold millennia before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by a forgotten deity.

==Description==
[[File:Metastakixx temple.png|thumb|''The interior of Metastakixx's prison.''|260x260px]]
[[File:Metastakixx's temple.png|thumb|''The prison's exterior.''|260x260px]]
Metastakixx was a mysterious and alien creature wrapped in a humanoid and somewhat feminine winged form. Their skin was a chrome-like mirror, and their body was shrouded in glowing light, worn like clothes. Metastakixx stood in the middle of the temple, unmoving like a metallic statue with intelligence sparking from behind their cloudy eyes.

Those who saw Metastakixx struggled with keeping their eyes on the creature, finding the winged form hard to comprehend, as if subconsciously making a discussion not to risk looking at their reflective shape for too long. Observers of the strange statuesque being felt an uncontrollable, overwhelming sorrow as if their hearts wept. When they spoke, they radiated waves of sadness and melancholy.

==Personality==

Metastakixx's mind was affected by their unknowable age and seeming constant pain. They could not speak easily as each word was a tremendous raspy-sounding effort. When Metastakixx had enough strength to try and remember anything, it was clear that everything in the creature's memory was gone, if it ever was there. Metastakixx did show signs of sentience and desire to know that or who they were and hoped to one day find out. The creature did not know of the "world." They have never seen what lies outside of their prison.

==Possessions==
The temple where Metastakixx stood was hidden in an ancient cave deep in the cliffs of the [[Crab's Claw Coast]]. The small domed temple rose from behind an ancient ornamental gate in a flooded cavern on an island. The chamber was filled with shadow-like mists. Unknown to all but the guardian, the mists were [[Fragment of a Corrupt God|Fragments of a Corrupt God]], a form of primordial evil suspended in a temporary form to be sealed away and rendered harmless. The shadows were kept in a harmless state by strange floating globes – ''Mirrored Vaporizers'' that projected rays of red light up towards the temple's dome.

The hidden temple held several artifacts that held echoes of the lost gods. The ''Last Remaining Pillar'' was a column that radiated old memories. When touched, bygone echoes of indeterminate gender sounded directionless in one's mind. The voice whispered, "Sssshhhhhh, we are sleeeeeeping...", then another voice joined in, joined by another, until it was a mental roar "Don't  lissssten, free usss, desssstroy them!"

Strange ''Sea Creature Statues'' decorated the temple. The creatures had some resemblance to [[dolphin]]s but were somehow different, making it apparent that the depicted creatures were likely long lost to the world. Like other things in the temple, the "dolphins" projected a mental message "Whisperers in the darkness. Ancient evil. Hideous hissing. Violence unchained. Peaceful shores under a silver sky. So it shall be, so has it has ever been."

A strange ancient artifact, the ''[[Dreamstone]]'', that dated back to the goddess [[Mystryl]], could be found on the temple's floor, possibly a remnant of some unfortunate soul trapped in the temple.

Lastly, the creature's shimmering glowing clothes were an [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] - the unique ''[[Cloak of Mists]]''.

==Relationships==
Metastakixx remembered almost nothing from their past apart from the name of a single being destined to release them from the unending sentry duty. The mirror figure did not remember how they knew of that person, nor did they ever wonder how they knew that name. Without Metastakixx and the destined individual knowing it, in some strange way, they've always loved each other, long before one was born and long after the other lost all of their memory.

==History==
{{fq
| text = ''For in this brief time we have had with each other, I have also known hope and I have known fulfillment, and I do not think that a life with these moments is a poor one. You made this possible for me without even knowing it. And finally, I know myself, for I see myself reflected in your eyes. I have lived an eternity and never known what I look like. I am beautiful... I am going now. Thank you, I love you.''

Everything about Metastakixx was a mystery. They knew that they were not born nor trapped in the lost chamber. Instead, Metastakixx was created inside the prison and tasked with the sentry duty over Fragments of a Corrupt God. It was unknown if Metastakixx was a woman, despite their feminine shape, and it was unknown if they were created to be sentient or if the sentience was developed over the course of countless centuries Metastakixx stood guard. "Forever" by their own accord.

Metastakixx waited for their creators to return, but they never did. The winged being stood guard, unmoving as centuries passed. Memories of who and what the masters were became clouded and then forgotten, just like the world around the temple forgot the creators. Memories disappeared one after the other until nothing remained in Metastakixx's mind but the sentry duty and the name of one individual not yet born.

Occasionally, moments of lucidity sparked in Metastakixx's mind, and they remembered ancient evil–shadows that came to swallow everything. Metastakixx's maker was in danger, and the sentry sealed the shadows, these  Fragments of a Corrupt God. The mirror being was tasked with keeping the shadows sealed in the hidden prison until the makes returned. They never did.

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an ancient key that unlocked the gates to Metastakixx's lost temple could be found in a pile of junk in [[Torleth's Treasures]] curio store in the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]].

Those who entered Metastakixx's chamber became trapped by the creature. The temple became sealed off until the mirrored being was released from their infinite task or the trapped Fragments of a Corrupt God were secured from being unleashed on the world. Metastakixx waited for the individual whose name was etched in their mind, the one who could defeat the shadows and help Metastakixx fulfill their purpose.

Unbeknown to Metastakixx, keeping the shadows imprisoned was the only thing, the only purpose, that sustained the winged guardian's life. If released, Metastakixx died, possibly due to expending all of their strength over the millennia or because the magical prison and Metastakixx were one and the same. The individual whose name Metastakixx remembered was destined to release them, leaving the savior swallowed by sadness and grief, crying over Metastakixx's lifeless body.
