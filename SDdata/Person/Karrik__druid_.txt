'''Karrik''' was a [[druid]] and a member of the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a grateful man that felt shame when his group did not live up to their fullest.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Archdruid Halsin granted sanctuary to [[tiefling]]s that were expelled from the city of [[Elturel]] following [[the Descent]], but was subsequently called to action when he discovered mysterious goings on surrounding the newly-formed [[Cult of the Absolute]]. His departure led to the rise of leadership [[Kagha]], a fellow druid that did not share Halsin's magnanimous nature. She called for the removal from the tieflings from the grove and the commencement of the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'', a ritual that would hide them away from the surrounding dangers of the Sword Coast.

While Karrik was one of the druids assigned to carry out the ritual he had strong misgivings about the entire situation.
