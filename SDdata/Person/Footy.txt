'''Footy''' was a precocious [[human]] child from [[Beregost]] ''circa'' midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1368 DR]], Footy was still an innocent child when his mother and brother [[Johnny]] disappeared, leaving Footy alone and homeless. The child searched for his missing family far and wide by all he could find were [[zombies]]. Footy did not realize that his family was murdered and raised by a mad [[cleric]] of [[Cyric]] in the [[Red Canyons]], named [[Basillus]]. After spying on the mad priest, the child witnessed him rambling at this [[zombie]] minions, seemingly thinking that they were his family. In response, the under just shuffled about and groaned. Soon after, Footy rushed away to tell his friend [[Netty]] about the funny man..
