Vulpomyscan was a brown dragon who dwelt in the Citadel of Black Ash in Unther.
Around , a clan of dwarves from the Brightstar Lake region began digging into the cliffs along the edge of the Black Ash Plain when they awakened Vulpomyscan, who ate their leaders and enslaved the remaining dwarves. He put them to work excavating and mining, and over the centuries, the dwarves and their descendents began worshiping him in the Citadel of Black Ash.
Sometime after , the human city of Unthalass began encroaching on Vulpomyscans territory. He flew out and ransacked the human empire, thus angering the Untheric pantheon. They challenged Vulpomyscan, and Marduk fought him in the skies over the Black Ash Plain, eventually slaying him.
