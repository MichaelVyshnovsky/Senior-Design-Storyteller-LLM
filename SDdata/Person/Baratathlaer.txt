'''Baratathlaer''', also called '''''Tayyib-kher''''', was a male [[Dragon aging|ancient]] [[brass dragon]] who made its lair somewhere in the [[Scimitar Spires]] in [[Anauroch]]. He was known to be still alive by [[1373 DR]].

The [[Bedine]] consider him to be a good-natured protector of the Scimitar Spires and he has been known to hold-up an entire tribe's travel by engaging in long conversations with their elders.
