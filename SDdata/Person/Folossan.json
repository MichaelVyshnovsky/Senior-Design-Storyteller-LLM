In the main room, they spotted a [[Elminster Aumar|decrepit corpse]] floating up near the ceiling, and four pillars in a large room. As Iyriklaunavan cast a spell to bring down the corpse, the pillars sprouted hundreds of eyes and attacked them.\n\nAfter managing to get away from the pillars of eyes, which the corpse attacked sand destroyed, the body approached the adventurers and asked what year it was. Nuressa replied with the date, to which the corpse immediately ''teleported'' away. The team decided to flee the tomb and leave it unexplored.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|517-518|Prologue}}\n\nLater, it turned out that Amandarn had gambled all their money away shortly afterward; Folossan nearly killed him for it. The two stole back some of their coin, got caught, and fled. After spending the evening under an altar to [[Mystra]], they found a small fortune and a deed to a castle by morning, which they presented to the rest of the team. Iyriklaunavan magically verified their account, but Nuressa only found out in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, during the bout of chaos of [[The Art]] that year.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|735-736|19}}"
