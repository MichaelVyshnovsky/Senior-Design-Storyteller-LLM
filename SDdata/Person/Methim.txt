}}'''Methim''' was the [[beast of Malar]] companion of [[Alaffinel]], a disgraced [[half-celestial]] of a noble line that fled from his kin and was on the run ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Methim was in the hunting panther form, with glossy black fur and red marks resembling blood splatter, on the face, shoulders, and paws.

==Personality==
Methim was an aggressive creature, fiercely loyal to Alaffinel. Only the half-celestial's influence could stop the Beast of Malar from rending their opponents on sight.

==Abilities==
Like other Beasts of Malar, Methim was a shapechanger able to switch between the hunting panther, claw slayer, and bat forms. The creature was resistant to non-magical damage and immune to ''fear''. Methim was also gifted with ''true seeing'' and ''regeneration''.
==Relationships==
Methim was Alaffinel's loyal companion, traveling across the planes with him.

==History==
Methim accompanied Alaffinel who fled justice of his kin across the planes after an unrevealed crime that disgraced him and the one he refused to atone for. ''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], Alaffinel's shelter was discovered by the group of adventurers investigating unrest in [[Daggerford]]. He confronted the unwanted guests, suspecting them being sent to capture or kill the half-celestial. Alaffinel felt he had no choice but to kill them to protect himself with loyal Methim by his side.
