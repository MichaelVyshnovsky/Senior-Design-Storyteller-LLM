Methim was the beast of Malar companion of Alaffinel, a disgraced half-celestial of a noble line that fled from his kin and was on the run circa 1370 DR.
Methim was in the hunting panther form, with glossy black fur and red marks resembling blood splatter, on the face, shoulders, and paws.
Methim was an aggressive creature, fiercely loyal to Alaffinel. Only the half-celestials influence could stop the Beast of Malar from rending their opponents on sight.
Like other Beasts of Malar, Methim was a shapechanger able to switch between the hunting panther, claw slayer, and bat forms. The creature was resistant to non-magical damage and immune to fear. Methim was also gifted with true seeing and regeneration.
Methim was Alaffinels loyal companion, traveling across the planes with him.
Methim accompanied Alaffinel who fled justice of his kin across the planes after an unrevealed crime that disgraced him and the one he refused to atone for. Circa 1370 DR, Alaffinels shelter was discovered by the group of adventurers investigating unrest in Daggerford. He confronted the unwanted guests, suspecting them being sent to capture or kill the half-celestial. Alaffinel felt he had no choice but to kill them to protect himself with loyal Methim by his side.
