        "History": "Shortly before the Chaos of [[the Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Hulder Phelbellow and other merchants made [[Thessamel Arunder]] an offer for his lands and tower, which consisted of 200,000 [[gp]], his continued tenancy, and twelve [[dee]]r a year, dressed for the table; in return, he was not to work [[magic]] against them. He responded to the offer by turning them into [[pig]]s for the evening.\n\nLater, [[Faeya]], Thessamel's apprentice, came to them and begged for them to try the offer again, as he was now unable to work magic. Faeya got Thessamel to sign the contract through a little bedroom trickery; on the morning, Hulder Phelbellow and other merchants came to Thessamel's door. There, after trading some barbs, they gave him the money and he received an explanation of what he'd signed."
