        "Personality": "Ongraunnathan had such a fondness for [[whiteworm]]s in [[wine]] that he often wound up in stupor lasting for hours after devouring a jar of them.",
        "Abilities": "Ongraunnathan had the ability to create flying [[zombie]]s, presumably from magically competent people. He was also blind.",
        "Possessions": "Ongraunnathan possessed a crown that allowed him to see the world out of two ''[[wizard eye]]s''.",
        "History": "Ongraunnathan the Blind was the court wizard of [[Pasha]] [[Eiruidin Ondaru]] in upland [[Calimshan]] until the year {{yearlink|1275}}, when he killed the Pasha and employed magic to make him appear to be alive. His deception lasted until {{yearlink|1286}}.\n\nAfter slaying his Pasha, Ongraunnathan routinely examined the slaves in his home for magical potential, making them perform various tasks for him. Those he found to bear magical potential, he slew, using them to create flying [[zombie]]s.\n\nHe was killed at some point between {{yearlink|1286}} and {{yearlink|1294}} by a sorcerer who dwelt not far away, who employed magic to turn those flying zombies against their master. They rose from the cellars and went to his bedchamber, where they tore him limb from limb."
