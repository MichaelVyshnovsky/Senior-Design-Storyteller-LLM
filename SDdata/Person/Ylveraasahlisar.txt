'''Ylveraasahlisar''', also known as the '''Rose Dragon''', was an infamous [[red dragon]] that ruled [[Calimshan]] for more than a century.

==History==
Ylveraasahlisar was a [[great wyrm]] who laired in the [[Cloud Peaks]]. In {{Yearlink|-1838}}, a group of [[Calishite]] adventurers crept into her lair to steal some of her treasure hoard, killing one of her brood in the process.

After this incident, an enraged Ylveraasahlisar attacked [[Calimport]], destroying two-thirds of the city including the [[Caleph's Court]] and the [[Raor Dynasty|Raor]] [[bakkal]], along with most of Calimshan's army. After the bloodbath, she seized the throne and her first edict was to reconstruct all she had destroyed. In a hurry to comply, her terrified subjects merely leveled the rubble enough to support new construction and began anew, thus creating much of the [[Calimport#The Undercity|Muzad]].

Ylveraasahlisar ruled until {{Yearlink|-1726}} when [[Rafak el Cajaan]] organized her demise. He gathered a group of dragonslayers, including a [[bronze dragon]] named [[Cadasalmpar]], that attacked the Rose Dragon by surprise in her court. After a fierce battle, she escaped from Calimport gravely wounded. Cadasalmpar tracked her down and administered the killing bite.
