'''King Melair I''' (then known only as '''Melair''') first discovered [[mithral]] ore beneath [[Mount Waterdeep]] in {{Yearlink|-1288}} and set about rallying together [[shield dwarves]] who would eventually create [[Melairbode]] and form [[Clan Melairkyn]] on that site. Although he passed away at an unknown time in the distant past, his ghost still occupies the royal crypt deep within the [[Undermountain]] and he firmly believes Clan Melairkyn is still a living clan.{{fact}}
