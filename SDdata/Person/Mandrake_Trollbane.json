Due to the precise catering to his client's needs, Mandrake's wagons easily sold for twice the normal asking price.\n\nMandrake built water-tight wagons used for river crossings, wagons sporting special springs for those carrying delicate cargo, and he could even add secret compartments used for smuggling or in case a caravan was attacked by bandits.\n\nCustomers who had the coin could expect their custom wagon within one week.",
        "History": "Originally from the distant [[Faerûn|barbarian north]], Mandrake moved to Huzuz in the early 1360s [[DR]]."
