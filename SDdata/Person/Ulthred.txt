'''Ulthred''' was a member of the [[Flaming Fist]] who served Counselor [[Florrick]] and Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ulthred had pale skin, [[Kara-Tur]]an features, and long straight black hair. He wore a set of [[scale mail]] with a [[tabard]] adorned with the Flaming Fist insignia. He wielded a [[greatsword]] in battle.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Ulthred was a member of the Flaming Fist cadre, which accompanied Counselor Florrick and Duke Ravengard on a trip outside of [[Baldur's Gate]]. They stopped over at [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, where they fell victim to the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s ambush in which Ulder Ravengard was kidnapped. Florrick and her Fists marched towards the [[Moonrise Towers]] to rescue the Duke but were waylaid by the dangers of the [[Shadow-cursed lands]]. Fist Ulthred and the rest found shelter in the [[Last Light Inn]], where they met High Harper [[Jaheira]] and her [[Harper]]s who sought to end the life of General [[Ketheric Thorm]], the leader of the Absolute's army.

When a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the Last Light Inn, Ulthred was among those present for the events that followed. Shortly after their arrival, [[gnome|gnomish]] Harper [[Essius]] was locked in an argument with Ulthred over their next actions and whether the new arrivals were trustworthy. Ulthred also sarcastically noted that Fists were not given rooms at the inn, unlike the Counselor, something Ulthred seemed to be bitter about. It was unknown if Fist Ulthred survived the war with the Absolute; he might've perished after the darkness consumed the Last Light Inn, or else he survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.
