'''Flink Thunderbonk''' was a [[deep gnome]] apprentice wizard of [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Flink was an apprentice wizard of [[Yantha Coaxrock]], leader of the [[Stoneheart Enclave]] in Blingdenstone. He went with his mistress to [[Mantol-Derith]] around [[1486 DR]], but there Yantha argued with [[Krimgol Muzgardt]], a [[duergar]] merchant, about [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]'s gem.

Flink, also influenced by the madness spread by the [[demon lord]] through the gem, hid it, and went to the [[drow]] section to buy some [[spell component]]s he believed Yantha needed. There, however, a [[gargoyle]] guard stole the [[gem]] from him. He remained hidden in the drow section in order to find the gargoyle and recover the gem. 

==Personality==
The arrival of the demon lord inflicted him with a madness that caused him to both want to please his mistress and greatly fear her.
