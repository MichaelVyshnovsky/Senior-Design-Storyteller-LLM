        "History": "Indeera gained acclaim and became a highly decorated member of the Mist of Shadows sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, achieving the rank of an officer and the second-in-command. Under her leadership, the Mist of Shadows protected the great ancestral forest of Cormanthor from monsters and bandits. She famously wore an [[enchanted]] set of [[leather armor]], later named ''[[Protector of the Second]]'', in her honor. Indeera's armor left her possessions under unknown circumstances."
