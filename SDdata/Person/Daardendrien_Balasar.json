        "mainbody": "aardendrien Balasar was a dragonborn warrior member of Clan Daardendrien and a high-ranking member of the Lance Defenders in 1479 DR. \nBalasar was considered a runt, for a dragonborn and ocher colored scales.\nHe was capable of breathing frost.\nHe was a close friend of his clanmate Daardendrien Medrash and the husband of Kanjentellequor Biri. \nBalasar was described as frivolous, immature and irresponsible. Like most dragonborn, Balasar didnt followed the teachings of any deity.\nIn 1479 DR, Balasar was sent to Luthcheq as member of a diplomatic party sent to assist ambassador Ophinshtalajiir Perra. This became a problem when, soon after, the Thymari diplomatic delegation was kicked out of Chessenta as the dragonborn had no evidence to prove their innocence, and Balasar was forced to return to Tymanther.\nDuring the travel back home, a topaz taaldarax (one of the players of Brimstones xorvintaal) attacked Perra and her delegation, but with the help of Medrash, Khouryn, and his men, the dragonborn were able to drive away the dragon.\nUpon arriving in Tymanther he found his native land under attack by ash giants from the Black Ash Plain. Medrash, Balasar and Khouryn led a small unit of Daardendrien warriors in an expedition to investigate the giants motives, but they were overwhelmed. As they fled, they encountered members of the Platinum Cadre in an operation to exterminate ash giants, and seeing what the followers of Bahamut were capable of, they joined them until they returned to Djerad Thymar.\nBalasar became suspicious of Nala, the Platinum Cadres cleric, and decided to infiltrate the order. He was initiated into the orders rites although he didnt fully open himself up to Bahamuts power (which was actually Tiamats). \nBalasar was part of the Platinum Cadre forces during Vanquisher Tarhuns joint military operation against the giants. Although Nala didnt wanted to attack at the same time the other Thymari military forces did it, Balasar was able to convince his \"brothers-in-arms\" to join into the fray. Balasar, Medrash, Nala and Patrin fought toe to toe in order to save Tarhuns life.\nAfter following Raiann, Balasar found Nalas secret apartments in the catacombs beneath Djerad Thymar. Later, he returned to the site with Khouryn and Medrash and discovered an altar to Tiamat, uncovering Nalas true role as a priestess of Tiamat. Balasars accusations led to a duel between Medrash and Patrin, the Cadres leader, that Medrash won.\nBalasar also took part in the operation to laid siege to Ashhold and to kill the green dragon Skuthosiin. During the battle, Balasar killed Nala. As a reward for his deed, he was reassigned to the Lance Defenders and promoted to the rank of knight, a high-ranking position within the military.\t\nWhen Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about Tchazzar plans to invade the dragonborn nation, Balasar was assigned to a mission to destroy Gestaniius and liberate High Imaskar from her forces, so the Imaskari would lend their aid to the Thymari. Balasar and his friends were sent to Luthcheq to escort ambassador Perra, who wanted to reinstate the diplomatic relations between Tymanther and Chessenta. However, when they reached the city, the Battle of Luthcheq had already begun. Balasar took part in the battle, helping the helping the Chessentan forces to destroy the dracolich Alasklerbanbastos.\nHe later went to Dracowyr alongside Medrash, Biri, the Brotherhood of the Griffon and the surviving dragons of the Battle of Luthcheq. Together, they put an end to Brimstones xorvintaal. After that, he returned to Tymanther, were he intended to marry Biri, although reluctantly."
