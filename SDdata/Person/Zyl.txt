'''Zyl''' was a fire spirit in the service of the [[Stag King]], a dark [[fey]] lord who lived in [[Ashenwood]] forest.  

He was sent by the Stag King to spy on a stronghold in the [[Feywild]] that belonged to a tribe of [[cyclops]] and their [[fomorian]] queen.  Zyl had shapechanged into the form of a [[giant rat]] but was captured by the cyclops' [[goblin]] servants who were about to prepare him to eat.  [[Aoth Fezim]] rescued Zyl who agreed to take Aoth to meet the Stag King.{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|1974}}
