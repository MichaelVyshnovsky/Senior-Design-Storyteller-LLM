'''Llombaerth Starym''', sometimes known as '''the Masked''', was a male [[elf]] [[wizard]] and the Lord Speaker of the [[Starym|Starym House]] of [[Cormanthyr]].

==Description==
He had a thin voice, and was coldly handsome.

==Powers==
He was able to teach [[Elminster]] of [[spell-web]] practice, and later, the [[lifequench]] spell. He was also able to collect magical objects from afar with a spell, including [[ghosts]] and of embodying ghosts back to flesh through a series of spells.

When in combat, he was able to launch a spell that resembled a white-hot bolt.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|338|19}} Another of his spells could compel another to cast spells, even against other targets.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|342|19}}

==History==
Llombaerth was one of the most prominent members of Starym House and was fierily against the [[History of Myth Drannor|Opening]] promised by the [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]]. He soon started to conspire to stop the project, forming part of a meeting at [[Castle Maendellyn]] in {{yearlink|241}}.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|259-263|13}}

That same year, Llombaerth discovered the phantom form of the [[human]] [[armathor]] [[Elminster Aumar]] after the failure of [[Haemir Waelvor]] and several [[Starym]] mages at slaying Mythanthor. He soon bound the human{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|303-305|16}} and, introducing himself only as The Masked, offered him a body and an apprenticeship. Elminster accepted{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|310-312|16}} and studied alongside the [[half-elf]] [[Nacacia]] after she was brought into the fold.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|317-320|17}}

In [[261 DR]], he finally found the hiding place of [[Mythanthar]], the architect of the promised ''[[mythal]]''. In a complex plot, he used his apprentices and even some [[drow]] to kill the mage. When Llombaerth later appeared before the [[Coronal]], [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], and framed Elminster for the assassination, he was exposed by the [[Srinshee]] and the still-alive Mythanthar.

Llombaerth summoned his forces and started a battle, intending to kill the coronal and all his allies but in the end was killed.

==Possessions==
He derived his nickname from his constant use of the artifact known as ''[[Andrathath's Mask]]''. He also possessed a ''[[storm-sword]]'', and as of {{yearlink|261}}, had been for some years in possession of some nondescript device that fit in the palm of his hand, but which he considered to be unstoppable by any Cormathan and capable of slaying Mythanthor.

==Relationships==
Though he was known as The Masked, he was not known to the Coronal as such.
