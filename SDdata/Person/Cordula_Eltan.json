My [[Eltan (family)|family's]] duty is to Baldur's Gate. I won't have the [[Nine Hells|Hells']] errand boy [[poison]] my city!''|Cordula Eltan}}",
        "Description": "Cordula was a [[human]] woman with chestnut hair gathered in a tight bun, a light skin tone, aquamarine eyes, and a stern demeanor.",
        "Abilities": "As a [[wizard]], she was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[quarterstaff]] and had a collection of deadly [[spell]]s ready: ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[otto's irresistible dance]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', and others. She was also trained in the use of [[medium armor|medium]] and [[heavy armor]], wearing a set of plates that did not restrict her movement when casting magics.\n\nCordula was always accompanied by two bodyguards: [[Pollo the Muscle]] and [[Wanda Tullermoor]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Cordula Eltan served the city of Baldur's Gate under Counsellor [[Florrick]], taking over her role were something to happen to the [[elf]]. She prided her family's history, and was fiercely loyal to the Dukes, including Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]]. When Duke Ravengard was abducted by the [[Cult of the Absolute]], he sent out a word of the looming cult and its dangers that reached Cordula. Desperate to save the city from a war, she could've passed ''[[The Legend of Ansur]]'' to the adventurers, also known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]], if she trusted them to defend the city and a confrontation with [[Wyll Ravengard]] had not turned bloody. Cordula Eltan believed that the legend of [[Ansur]] was true and the [[dragon]] could rise one time and only once time if called to defend the city of Baldur's Gate."
