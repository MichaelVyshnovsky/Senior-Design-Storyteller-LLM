'''Sintre''' was a [[malaugrym]] seeking [[spellfire]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sintre's own form was mutable. Amongst other disguises, she bore the form of a warrior in a mule train from the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and a wandering priestess of [[Oghma]].

==Abilities==
Either Sintre or her bother were capable of launching magic without any of the usual tells, surprising even other malaugrym.

==Relationships==
Sintre wandered with her sibling [[Architrave]].

==History==
Sintre and Architrave were the children of [[Amarune]], an exiled malaugrym. Their mother went missing at some point in their lives.

In {{yearlink|1357}}, Sintre and Architrave accidentally revealed themselves to two other malaugrym who were seeking entry into the [[Gates of Doom]]. The encounter quickly turned violent, with the other two fleeing after either Sintre or Architrave struck them with deadly magic, on [[Mirtul 20]].

Some time later, after [[Manshoon]] went missing from Zhentil Keep, both Sintre and Architrave met anew while disguised as priests of [[Bane]]. They attacked each other, stopping only after realizing their true identities. Architrave revealed he had acquired a ''[[doomstar]]''.

Sintre was slain at [[the Rising Moon (inn)|the Rising Moon]], where she demanded to see a private letter from [[Elminster]] to [[Gorstag]]. Gorstag refused. When she attacked him, he retaliated with an [[enchanted]] axe, killing her nigh-immediately on [[Flamerule 9]].
