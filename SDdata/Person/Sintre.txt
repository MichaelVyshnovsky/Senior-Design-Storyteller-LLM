Sintre was a malaugrym seeking spellfire in the mid-14 century DR.
Sintres own form was mutable. Amongst other disguises, she bore the form of a warrior in a mule train from the Cult of the Dragon, and a wandering priestess of Oghma.
Either Sintre or her bother were capable of launching magic without any of the usual tells, surprising even other malaugrym.
Sintre wandered with her sibling Architrave.
Sintre and Architrave were the children of Amarune, an exiled malaugrym. Their mother went missing at some point in their lives.
In , Sintre and Architrave accidentally revealed themselves to two other malaugrym who were seeking entry into the Gates of Doom. The encounter quickly turned violent, with the other two fleeing after either Sintre or Architrave struck them with deadly magic, on Mirtul 20.
Some time later, after Manshoon went missing from Zhentil Keep, both Sintre and Architrave met anew while disguised as priests of Bane. They attacked each other, stopping only after realizing their true identities. Architrave revealed he had acquired a doomstar.
Sintre was slain at the Rising Moon, where she demanded to see a private letter from Elminster to Gorstag. Gorstag refused. When she attacked him, he retaliated with an enchanted axe, killing her nigh-immediately on Flamerule 9.
