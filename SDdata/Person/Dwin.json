        "mainbody": "'''Dwin''' was an adventuring [[priest]] of [[Tymora]] who traveled alongside famed [[Bard]] of [[Starmantle]] and author [[Adamar Session]] for a decade in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Even though it was not recorded when Dwin joined Adamar Session's adventuring troupe, their travels were detailed in a guide to the Vilhon Reach, published by Adamar after he settled in Starmantle as a history teacher at a college there by the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. Other members of the band included [[fighter]] [[Anathet]],and [[Sarun]] the master of [[the Art]].\n\nOne of the ventures of note was the group's trip through the islands on the [[Eyes of Silvanus]], [[Wavecrest]], and [[Ilighôn]], aboard Captain [[Hanshet]]'s vessel. During their trip to the thick and dangerous jungle island of Wavecrest, Dwin's healing magics proved to be invaluable after Anathet was gored by a {{SI|7'|'\"|long=yes}} tall [[jaguar]]-like creature. Dwin approved of the danger Adamar exposed the team to stating that \"fortune favors the bold.\" After the jungles, they explored the island of the [[Emerald Enclave]] – Ilighôn. As the ship approached the [[Eldath's Ring]] that encircled the island, Dwin was the only passenger who noticed what guided them safely into the harbors of [[Sapra]]. She shared with her comrades that it were [[water elemental]]s who gently picked up the vessel and carried it through the dangerous ring of reefs. The elementals were known as [[Seven Sentinels of Silvanus]]. Dwin was in awe of the creatures, while Adamar Session believed that it might've been Tymora's aid, thanks to Dwin's presence, that let them pass the reefs without trouble.\n\nThe group's travels through [[Turmish]] were quite informative. The group observed and learned the rich traditions of the land. Dwin and Adamar Session witnessed a Turmishian man digging up a [[gemstone]] that was left in the ground as a traditional offering to the land. The act was considered to be highly illegal, and the man fled just as the guards whose up. With the help of Dwin's spell, the criminal was apprehended while the group received accolades for the act. They also visited the capital of [[Alaghôn]] during the travels. In one of the city's many passages, they encountered an {{SI|8'|'\"|long=yes}} tall cloth-wrapped monster who fled after giving the bard and the warrior a major walloping. Dwin found her healing to be useless in the recovery, and the group spent two weeks healing and resting in one of Alaghôn's inns. The guard only laughed at the group's claims of a monstrous attack, simply saying that \"monsters don't live in Turmish.\"\n\nAnother adventure of note was during the band's trip through the [[Shining Plains]]. During their stop in the [[Thunderhoof Lodge]] drinking establishment in the town of [[Ormath]], the troupe witnessed a monster attack across the street from the tavern. Three powerful [[manticore]]s attacked the local militia, and Adamar's group rushed into battle. Dwin showed her dexterity in avoiding the manticores' as she cast protective magics on her friends. The spell attracted the creatures, and they launched a volley of deadly tail darts at the cleric. Subsequently, the group persevered as Dwin incinerated one of the creatures with a well-placed ''[[flame strike]]'' incantation. The group was celebrated, and Thunderhoof Lodge offered them free lodgings. The same night, the band participated in a Planesmen's ceremony where the adventurers had their hands cut, dropping several drops of blood onto the earth, making them honorary citizens as per the local tradition. Dwin and the group spent the rest of the night celebrating and feasting."
