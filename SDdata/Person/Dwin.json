        "mainbody": "win was an adventuring priest of Tymora who traveled alongside famed Bard of Starmantle and author Adamar Session for a decade in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nEven though it was not recorded when Dwin joined Adamar Sessions adventuring troupe, their travels were detailed in a guide to the Vilhon Reach, published by Adamar after he settled in Starmantle as a history teacher at a college there by the . Other members of the band included fighter Anathet,and Sarun the master of the Art.\nOne of the ventures of note was the groups trip through the islands on the Eyes of Silvanus, Wavecrest, and Ilighôn, aboard Captain Hanshets vessel. During their trip to the thick and dangerous jungle island of Wavecrest, Dwins healing magics proved to be invaluable after Anathet was gored by a  tall jaguar-like creature. Dwin approved of the danger Adamar exposed the team to stating that \"fortune favors the bold.\" After the jungles, they explored the island of the Emerald Enclave – Ilighôn. As the ship approached the Eldaths Ring that encircled the island, Dwin was the only passenger who noticed what guided them safely into the harbors of Sapra. She shared with her comrades that it were water elementals who gently picked up the vessel and carried it through the dangerous ring of reefs. The elementals were known as Seven Sentinels of Silvanus. Dwin was in awe of the creatures, while Adamar Session believed that it mightve been Tymoras aid, thanks to Dwins presence, that let them pass the reefs without trouble.\nThe groups travels through Turmish were quite informative. The group observed and learned the rich traditions of the land. Dwin and Adamar Session witnessed a Turmishian man digging up a gemstone that was left in the ground as a traditional offering to the land. The act was considered to be highly illegal, and the man fled just as the guards whose up. With the help of Dwins spell, the criminal was apprehended while the group received accolades for the act. They also visited the capital of Alaghôn during the travels. In one of the citys many passages, they encountered an  tall cloth-wrapped monster who fled after giving the bard and the warrior a major walloping. Dwin found her healing to be useless in the recovery, and the group spent two weeks healing and resting in one of Alaghôns inns. The guard only laughed at the groups claims of a monstrous attack, simply saying that \"monsters dont live in Turmish.\"\nAnother adventure of note was during the bands trip through the Shining Plains. During their stop in the Thunderhoof Lodge drinking establishment in the town of Ormath, the troupe witnessed a monster attack across the street from the tavern. Three powerful manticores attacked the local militia, and Adamars group rushed into battle. Dwin showed her dexterity in avoiding the manticores as she cast protective magics on her friends. The spell attracted the creatures, and they launched a volley of deadly tail darts at the cleric. Subsequently, the group persevered as Dwin incinerated one of the creatures with a well-placed flame strike incantation. The group was celebrated, and Thunderhoof Lodge offered them free lodgings. The same night, the band participated in a Planesmens ceremony where the adventurers had their hands cut, dropping several drops of blood onto the earth, making them honorary citizens as per the local tradition. Dwin and the group spent the rest of the night celebrating and feasting."
