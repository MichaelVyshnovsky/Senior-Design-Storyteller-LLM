        "mainbody": "'''Xargithorvar''', better known by his nickname '''Foilsunder''', was a [[green dragon]] of unknown age who laired in the [[Winterwood]] near the [[Wintercloak River]] of the [[Lake of Steam]] region in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Even though the exact location of Foilsunder's lair was unknown, it stood somewhere around {{SI|20|mile|long=yes}} away from the Wintercloak River.",
        "History": "Rumors of Xargithorvar lairing in the Winterwood started appearing several years before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}; however, not many took them seriously. Despite that, the wyrm had been calling the forest his home for several decades by that point. At least three groups of [[adventurer]]s ventured into Winterwood to find Foilsunder's lair, but none returned.\n\nDuring the [[Dracorage]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Xargithorvar became affected by the event and went into a frenzy across Winterwood, destroying everything in his path. Local [[ranger]]s counted around a hundred [[orc]]s to have been displaced by the rampage, sending the horde towards [[Ilmater]]'s [[Monastery of the White Willow]].\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Xargithorvar came into conflict with the Winterwood cell of an [[elf|elven]] extremist groupâ€”the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]]. The elves sought a way to drive the green dragon from the woods the cell considered their own."
