        "mainbody": "lairdrin Mellwith was a womanizing mage who resided in the Star Mounts of northwest Faer√ªn long before the late 14 century DR.\nElairdrins claim to fame was the creation of the first amulet of metaspell influence, which he called the Amplifier. His motivations were far from scholarly as the scoundrel used the Amplifier to aid his womanizing habits. Sometime later, the original Amplifier was taken from Elairdrin Mellwith by a wizard who planned to use the amulet to harness destructive magics. How the item was claimed remained unclear as historic accounts of that event varied wildly."
