'''Nihal''', sometimes called the '''Serpent Star''', was a star-like [[Elder Evil]] from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Nihal didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

== Description ==
Nihal was a red star,{{Cite dragon/403/Class Actsâ€”Warlock: Strange Constellations|2}}

==History==
Nihal, and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, were somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Nihal writhed around the position it should hold in the sky,{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|18}} and because of that it was called the Serpent Star. Sometimes Nihal sent its agents to [[Toril]], the [[Serpent of Nihal|Serpents of Nihal]], to feed on living things so Nihal could sate its hunger. Some scholars believed Nihal was the brother of another elder evil, [[Kyuss]], or even the same being observed from two different points in time.

Nihal was one of the stars the [[warlock]] [[Japheth Donard]] sought out in [[1396 DR]], after having lost his pact with the [[archfey]] [[Neifion]].
