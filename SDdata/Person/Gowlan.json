        "Description": "Gowlan was a [[human]] man with a light skin tone, brown eyes, and a shaved head.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Absolute crisis]] ravaged the Gate, Gowlan's fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the [[Gray Harbor]]. Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up [[net]]s filled with fish covered in black [[oil]]y goo. Not just his catch, but also [[Fleer]]'s and Gowlan's boat was soiled by the oil, leaving him frustrated and unable to lean the gunk off. To make things worse, Fleer and Gowlan fished a dead [[waveservant]] from the Gray Harbor. In reality, the fish were smothered in oil pollution left behind by a [[submersible]] used by the [[Cult of Bane]] to transport [[Lord Gortash]]'s prisoners into the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]] prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor."
