'''Squch''' was a [[scaladar]] and self-proclaimed leader of the mechanical entities that populate [[Trobriand's Graveyard]]. He was created by Trobriand as one of his "most intellectually stimulating experiments in this century" (century not known). He aimed to break free from the graveyard and control the city of [[Waterdeep]] for himself. He used the other inhabitants to help him discover this exit. Squch could speak both [[Common]] and [[Drow (language)|Drow]]. Unusually for a scaladar, Squch had independent will.
