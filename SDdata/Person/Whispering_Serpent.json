Believed to be the [[ghost]] of a [[couatl]], in truth he was a living couatl using ''[[ethereal jaunt]]''. He advised Lady [[Ilnara Mremman]] around [[1373 DR]].\n\nHis main duty was to ready the forces of western Lapaliiya to defend against the [[yuan-ti]]. Sometimes he hired adventurers to thwart yuan-ti plots, by manifesting before them."
