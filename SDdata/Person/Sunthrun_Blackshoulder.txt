Sunthrun Blackshoulder was a high-ranking Zhentilar warrior in High Dale, known for his cruelty and his habit of butchering women and younglings if possible.
In 1358 DR, Sunthrun was the second-in-command of Constable Heladar Longspear in the secret Zhent occupation army in High Dale. When an insurrection against the Zhents started, thanks to Elminster Aumars and the Rangers Threes actions, Heladar was killed and Sunthrun became the acting Zhentilar commander.
However, when the Dalesfolks led by Irreph Mulmar invaded the High Castle Sunthrun confronted the Harpers Itharr and Belkram inside but, with the timely arrival of Sharantyr, the Harpers managed to kill Sunthrun.
