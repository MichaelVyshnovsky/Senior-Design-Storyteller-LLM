'''Sunthrun Blackshoulder''' was a high-ranking [[Zhentilar]] warrior in [[High Dale]], known for his cruelty and his habit of butchering women and younglings if possible.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Sunthrun was the second-in-command of Constable [[Heladar Longspear]] in the secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. When an insurrection against the Zhents started, thanks to [[Elminster Aumar]]'s and the [[Rangers Three]]'s actions, Heladar was killed and Sunthrun became the acting Zhentilar commander.

However, when the Dalesfolks led by [[Irreph Mulmar]] invaded the [[High Castle]] Sunthrun confronted the [[Harpers]] [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]] and [[Belkram Hardeth|Belkram]] inside but, with the timely arrival of [[Sharantyr]], the Harpers managed to kill Sunthrun.
