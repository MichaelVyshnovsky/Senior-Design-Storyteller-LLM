Mitre LeMond was a moon elf adventuring ranger obsessed with the color yellow in the 14 century DR.
Mitre was a silent and reserved man with an eccentric obsession with the color yellow. He often dyed his clothes and weapons yellow, matching his hair. He preferred to stay silent to the point where he was drawing complex and intricate maps in the dirt to communicate with his teammates.
Mitre LeMond wore his magic +1 elven chainmail and carried a decanter of endless water.
