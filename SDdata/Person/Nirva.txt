'''Nirva''' was a [[cloud giant]] on a quest sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], after the disappearance of King [[Hekaton]], Nirva and sibling [[Jaral]] went on a quest in order to place the cloud giant stripe (and themselves) at the top of the renewed [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]]. They followed a legend and found pieces of a fallen [[cloud castle|cloud giant's castle]] in the [[High Moor]]. Nirva and Jaral went to [[Secomber]] in order to find more about regional history in order to find the exact resting place of the castle.
