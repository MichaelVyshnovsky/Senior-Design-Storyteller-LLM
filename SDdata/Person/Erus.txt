Erus was a tan-skinned [[human]] woman with light brown eyes. As a Cashguard, she wore a set of uniform [[breastplate]] [[armor]] and a [[helmet]]. Erus was armed with a two-handed [[heavy crossbow]] but also carried a [[shield]] and a [[rapier]] for close combat.

==History==

Se stood shoulder-to-shoulder with a fellow Cashuard Artillerist â€“ [[Jacko]]. Erus was mostly annoyed with Jacko and his tendency to talk on the job, complaining about strange sounds, discussing the bank's clients, and asking about Erus's lunch plans.
