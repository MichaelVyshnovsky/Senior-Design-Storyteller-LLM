Snooki was a belabra who guarded the cottage belonging to the wizard Winterthur Redberry in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Snooki was highly protective of her children. She was also not intelligent enough to discern between friendly and unfriendly creatures, and she often attacked violently and unthinkingly.
Snooki acted as pet and guardian at the forest cottage of Winterthur Redberry, an elderly wizard. She was known to rest in his garden, disguised as a rock. She used her tentacles to hold trespassers in place.
After many years of service to Winterthur, Snooki gave birth to six baby belabras.
