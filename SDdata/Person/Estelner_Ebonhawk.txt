Baron '''Estelner Ebonhawk''' was the head of [[Ebonhawk]] noble family of [[Cormyr]] in [[1371 DR]].{{Cite dragon annual/2000/After the Dragon: The Kingdom of Cormyr Today|66}}

He was young and unsure of himself, and widely thought to be a dunderhead trying to look good to the Crown. He led a troop of lancers, but had no skill with the weapon himself.
