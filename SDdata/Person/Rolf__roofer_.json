        "mainbody": "olf was a roofer of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was a young man, but big.\nRolf had his heart only on Mayella Meadowbrock, whod been his friend since childhood. However, she was the daughter of Barthelm Meadowbrock, who disapproved of the lowborn laborer.\nThe bully Dovo knew Rolfs temper was his weak spot and so liked to insult him and make him jealous by pestering Mayella to get a rise out of him.\nRolf had a short, hot, and violent temper. He got into fights just about every tenday, so much so that his father worried about him.\nIn around Ches of the , Rolf was hired by Lukas Spoondrift to repair the roof of the Sheaf of Wheat inn. However, one midnight, heavy boxes of wood shingles left on the roof fell through the floors and rained shingles down on Spoondrift and his wife in their bed. While Spoondrift blamed Rolf, Rolf denied the already rotten beams were his fault. Rolfs father, also a roofer, offered to share the cost of rebuilding, but Spoondrift refused. They took the matter to a magistrate in Wheloon, and argued about it through the rest of the year. Lukas maintained a grudge against Rolf thereafter.\nRolf once apparently almost killed a man in a brawl in Thunderstone. While the other guy started it, Rolf finished it.\nAfter a hard days work, Rolf and a pair of fellow roofers went to the Bold Bard tavern on the evening of Eleint 16, boasting he could expose the culprit behind recent sightings of Fastreds ghost. When he saw the lecherous Dovo harassing Mayella, he intervened, and lost his temper when Dovo insulted him. The two got into a tavern brawl while Barthelm ordered Mayella to leave with him. Tavernkeeper Shortshanks broke it up, Rolf got the blame for starting it, and was roughly thrown out and even billed for the mess.\nWhen Dovo was found dead the next morning, after impersonating Fastreds ghost, Rolf was briefly considered by some as a suspect.\nOn Eleint 19, Rolf was again trying to enjoy a night at the Bold Bard when he and Shortshanks were forced by four Purple Dragons to go with them to a midnight meeting at Benelaiuss cottage. Naturally, they were angry about this. There, Benelaius revealed the murderer of Dovo and Grodoveth Rolf was cleared of involvement, despite his hot-tempered interruptions and boldly declaring hed die to defend Mayellas honor."
