        "mainbody": "'''Ryxfith''' was the leader of a group of [[ettercap]]s who occupied the upper floors and spires of [[Castle Never]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ettercap thought of itself as a mystic or prophet.",
        "History": "The ettercaps of Castle Never had once dwelt deep in the dungeons while the building was still in use, but following its abandonment after the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century DR, they claimed the ruined castle as its new rulers. However, when the [[undead]] servants of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] arrived, it forced Ryxfith's ettercaps to flee to the upper floors, where they proceeded to fill the halls and spires with their webs.\n\nAs long as they stayed away, the [[Thayan]] undead left the ettercaps alone, and so they soon grew complacent. Then, a [[beholder]] known as [[Talgath]] arrived in Castle Never, and began attempting to subjugate the ettercaps. As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Ryxfith was declaring a prophecy that strangers from outside the castle would soon arrive to liberate them from the menace posed by Talgath."
