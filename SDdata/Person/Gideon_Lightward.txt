'''Gideon Lightward''' was a corrupted priest of [[Lathander]] in [[Elturel]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Despite being corrupted, Gideon still viewed himself as a bastion of good because his objective was only to destroy all demons. However he was filled with hatred for those that did not obey his commands.

==History==
Gideon was a very zealous priest of Lathander. [[Zariel]], believing him a very useful asset, in the {{YearlinkName|1492}} sent various [[devil]]s posing as [[angel]]s to slowly corrupt him by offering great power to battle [[demon]]s.

In time, Gideon gave his free will completely to the [[archdevil]] and when Elturel was dragged down to the [[Nine Hells]] he was Zariel's most loyal servant. Gideon died during the fall but rose as an [[undead]] creature.

Thanks to the dark energies of [[the Companion]], he began to assemble all the dead of the city's cemetery into a undead army to battle the demons.

He barricaded himself inside the Chapel of Mourning together with two [[mezzoloth]]s while waiting to resurrect his army of undead.
