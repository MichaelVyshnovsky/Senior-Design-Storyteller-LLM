        "mainbody": "'''Hanno Minstrelsong''', not his original name, was a [[half-elf]] [[rogue]] living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was the proprietor of [[Hanno's Herbs and Medicines]].<ref group=\"note\">Hanno Minstrelsong is stated on the map of the ''[[Waterdeep (adventure)|Waterdeep]]'' adventure to be a [[halfling]], while the ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' adventure says he is a half-elf. This article assumes the latter case by using the more recent source, and because the accompanying image in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' apparently shows a full-sized man, not a halfling.",
        "Personality": "Hanno was described as always smiling.",
        "Activities": "Hanno Minstrelsong sold a variety of mundane healing supplies, including [[herb]]s, poultices, medicines, and [[alchemy|alchemical]] mixtures, as well as magical [[potion]]s. He also bought bulk quantities of powdered and bottled herbs from [[halfling]] [[hamlet]]s along Cormyr's southern coast and eastern farming belt, and sold them to caravan merchants who distributed them in markets in [[Suzail]], [[Sembia]], and [[Westgate]].\n\nHe even sold nonlethal [[poison]]s to those who inquired discreetly and appeared trustworthy. However, Hanno didn't sell any lethal poisons, and those who asked for them could end up being watched by the [[Purple Dragons]].",
        "History": "Once, he was a highly successful thief. He was so successful, in fact, that a whopping six [[assassin]]s were individually sent after him. He was forced to flee [[Amn]] with [[magic]]al assistance.\n\nRetiring from a life of crime and adopting the name \"Hanno Minstrelsong\", he settled down in Wheloon in Cormyr. He set up as a herbalist and physician, selling a variety of healing goods from Hanno's Herbs and Medicines.\n\nHe was in business by [[1358 DR]], and continued through [[1369 DR]]. He was still in business in [[1374 DR]]."
