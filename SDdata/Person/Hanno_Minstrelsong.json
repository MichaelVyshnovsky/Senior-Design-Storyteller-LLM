        "mainbody": "Hanno Minstrelsong, not his original name, was a half-elf rogue living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was the proprietor of Hannos Herbs and Medicines.Hanno Minstrelsong is stated on the map of the Waterdeep adventure to be a halfling, while the Cormyr The Tearing of the Weave adventure says he is a half-elf. This article assumes the latter case by using the more recent source, and because the accompanying image in Volos Guide to Cormyr apparently shows a full-sized man, not a halfling.\nHanno was described as always smiling.\nHanno Minstrelsong sold a variety of mundane healing supplies, including herbs, poultices, medicines, and alchemical mixtures, as well as magical potions. He also bought bulk quantities of powdered and bottled herbs from halfling hamlets along Cormyrs southern coast and eastern farming belt, and sold them to caravan merchants who distributed them in markets in Suzail, Sembia, and Westgate.\nHe even sold nonlethal poisons to those who inquired discreetly and appeared trustworthy. However, Hanno didnt sell any lethal poisons, and those who asked for them could end up being watched by the Purple Dragons.\nOnce, he was a highly successful thief. He was so successful, in fact, that a whopping six assassins were individually sent after him. He was forced to flee Amn with magical assistance.\nRetiring from a life of crime and adopting the name \"Hanno Minstrelsong\", he settled down in Wheloon in Cormyr. He set up as a herbalist and physician, selling a variety of healing goods from Hannos Herbs and Medicines.\nHe was in business by 1358 DR, and continued through 1369 DR. He was still in business in 1374 DR."
