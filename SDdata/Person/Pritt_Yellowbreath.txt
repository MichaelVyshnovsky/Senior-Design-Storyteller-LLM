==Description==
Pritt Yellowbreath was a golden-scaled [[dragonborn]] woman with eyes of orange flames. She was dressed in quality finery.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Pritt became a loyal reader of the ''Baldur's Mouth Gazette'' and a connoisseur of its puzzle section. When the [[broadsheet]] began publishing the overwhelming number of articles in support of the new lord â€“ [[Enver Gortash]] and updates on the raging [[Absolute crisis]], Pritt's beloved puzzles had to be dropped. She spent her days walking around the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, ranting about the failing new direction of the ''Gazette''.
