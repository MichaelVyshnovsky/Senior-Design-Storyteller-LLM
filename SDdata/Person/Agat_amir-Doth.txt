Agat amir-Doth was a middle-aged elf and the Chief Vizier of Jumlat in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
Agat relished intrigue and had a craving for human women.
Agat maintained a vast spy network, primarily among the poor citizens of Jumlat. One of Agats favorite forms of entertainment was eliminating an attractive female targets family members one at a time until she had no other option but to join the harim. Because of this veils were used more often in Jumlat in an attempt to mask beauty from Agats predatory eyes.
