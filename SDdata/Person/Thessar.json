        "mainbody": "'''Thessar the Warrior''' was a famous former mercenary in [[1370]].",
        "History": "Thessar worked as a mercenary for a long time on the [[Dragon Coast]], having many adventures. Once retired in [[Westgate]], he settled in a modest house where many young and old mercenaries gathered to listen to Thessar's stories. Secretly, he joined the [[Men of the Basilisk]] and thanks to his skills Thessar increased the society's power in the city. After the turmoil inside the [[Night Masks]] in [[1368 DR]], Thessar and his fellows gained more power but they remained cautious and did not openly challenge the guild."
