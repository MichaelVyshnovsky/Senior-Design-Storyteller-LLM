{{quote|''I just wanna go home.''|Drongo Bixworth}}

==Description==
Drongo was a young [[human]] man with a dark brown skin tone, black eyes, and black hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Drongo Bixworth and his husband, Florean, found themselves unjustly detained by [[Flaming Fist|Fist]] [[Elthira Gossen]] during what was meant to be a promenade through the Lower City of the Gate. The couple, taking a rest due to Florean's lame leg, appeared suspicious to the overzealous Fist patrolwoman. Despite their innocence and only wanting to return home, Florean and Drongo were subjected to unwarranted accusations and harassment for simply loitering.
