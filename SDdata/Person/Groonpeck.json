        "mainbody": "'''Groonpeck''' was a scholar who authored the obnoxiously named [[book]] ''[[Groonpeck's Field Guide to Terrifying Denizens of the Air, with special appendices for Acheron, the Elemental Planes, and the Abyss]]'' sometime long before [[1217 DR]].",
        "Description": "Groonpeck's reputation was that of not the greatest scholar.",
        "History": "In 1217 DR, ''Groonpeck's Field Guide to Terrifying Denizens of the Air'' was used by [[Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomarta]] and his love interest Princess [[Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria]] to identify a strange huge seemingly intelligent bird they befriended by accident. The huge bright orange-plumed beast named [[Tekorriikii]] was a [[firebird]], a \"sacred, untouchable, and extremely dangerous\" beast to be avoided at all cost. Even though the book claimed firebirds to be such, the reality proved otherwise."
