        "Relationships": "Zoey had a good working relationship with her fellow Neverwintan guardsman Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] and even served alongside her sister [[Abbey Fargo|Abbey]].\n\nShe had a history with [[Karzov]], the second-in-command of the violent splinter faction of the [[Sons of Alagondar]] known as the [[Nashers]]. He put a bounty on her head and she sought payback.",
        "History": "Following the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Zoey Fargo was stationed in the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] of Neverwinter. She was tasked with stopping the efforts of the the violent splinter faction of the [[Sons of Alagondar]] known as the [[Nashers]] within the district, working with Private [[Hawthidon Faalwun]].\n\nZoey was staking out a known safehouse occupied by Karzov when Hawthidon sent an intrepid adventurer seeking the stolen ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'' to work with her. When the Nashers realized the Guard were onto them, they set fire to the building to cover their escape. Zoey and the adventurer pursued them through the burning building, defeated Karzov's guards, but Zarzov escaped to the Nashers' warehouse headquarters. For a distraction, Zoey had the adventurer burn the Nashers' smuggled supply shipments. The pair then cornered Karzov in his headquarters, killed him, and recovered the ''Crown of Neverwinter''.\n\nA short time later she joined up with the adventurer again, along with her sister Zoey and their fellow guardsmen Sergeant Knox, [[Dell McCourt]], Hawthidon Faalwun, and [[Josef Linkletter]], in order to rescue [[Dorothea Linkletter]] from the evil [[wizard]] [[Rhazzad]]."
