'''Kaross''' was an ambassador for the [[Shadovar]] of [[Netheril]] in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
She was a powerful spellcaster in the Netherese tradition.

==Activities==
She resided in the [[Dark creeper enclave|Shadovar Embassy]] of Evernight and had a handful of [[Shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] bodyguards.

One of her responsibilities was to safeguard the secrets of the [[Shard of Night]] and its use by the Netherese to spy on [[Neverwinter]]. She slew many Neverwintans who came close to learning of this.

==History==
Kaross was granted citizenship by the [[Tribunal (Evernight)|Tribunal of Evernight]], which allowed her to operate safely within the city despite the many ravenous [[undead]].

During the crisis appearance of the [[Cloaked Ascendancy]] in Neverwinter, Kaross was slain in a plot orchestrated by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Myros]] in which a [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge|hero]] from Neverwinter was sent to kill her and claim her essence. The hero did so, and unwittingly negated the protection that had been granted to them by the Tribunal upon killing the likewise protected Kaross.
