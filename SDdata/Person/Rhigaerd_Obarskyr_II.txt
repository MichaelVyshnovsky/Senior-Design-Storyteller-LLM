'''Rhigaerd Obarskyr II''' was a king of [[Cormyr]] and son of [[Azoun III]].

==Relatives==
Rhigaerd II was the father of [[Azoun IV]] and had a daughter named [[Sulesta Obarskyr|Sulesta]]. He was married to [[Tanalusta Truesilver]].

==History==
Rhigaerd was renowned for his spies. He gave them all ''[[Worn Whispers|boots of stealth]]'' and sent them off to map all castles and towns. Eventually the order of spies was betrayed from within and the boots were dispersed into the realms so that nobody could amass such a band again.The item description given in ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' doesn't specify whether the king in question was [[Rhiigard Obarskyr]] (sometimes spelled "Rhiegard") or [[Rhigaerd Obarskyr II]]. Due to the inconsistent spelling of Rhiigard, this article assumes Rhigaerd II had the boots commissioned.

==Background==
When Azoun III died, prince Rhigaerd II was only six years old, so [[Salember Obarskyr]] took the throne of Cormyr as regent. Salember plotted to kill Rhigaerd and take the throne, leading Cormyr into civil war.
