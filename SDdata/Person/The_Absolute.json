        "Abilities": "Enhanced by the Crown of Karsus, the Elder Brain 'laid' modified [[mind flayer]] tadpoles that induced a suspended [[ceremorphosis]] that left the host susceptible to the telepathic influence of the Absolute. Two key features of this were that the host remained unaware of its manipulated state and that this control persisted even at distances beyond the usual range of the elder brain. These tadpoles allowed for paused ceremorphosis and facilitated the covert spread of infection in those known as [[True Soul]]s. Moreover, the tadpoles were irremovable by both physical and magical means; attempts to remove them risked severe cranial trauma or death.",
        "History": "Sometime in the 11{{th}} century DR, the yet-to-be-subjugated elder brain was at the helm of a mind flayer colony beneath [[Moonrise Towers]], capturing various beings for transformation into its own kind. Among the captives was an [[adventurer]] known as [[Balduran]]. At some point, owing to a lack of food, the elder brain entered a dormant state to preserve its life, until the [[Dark Urge]], Bhaal's Chosen, and Bane's Chosen [[Enver Gortash]] found it and subdued the elder brain with the [[Crown of Karsus]].\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], many tribes began to swear allegiance to the Absolute, and other creatures became united and rallied to the cause. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] heard about this and sought out any who made contact with the zealots of the Absolute. He claimed to have interrogated a [[goblin]] captive, who told him that they had forsaken [[Maglubiyet]] \"in favor of someone called 'The Absolute'.\" Volo noticed that, since their loyalty was now with the Absolute, they had become \"informed by a kind of strategy anathema to their kind.\" The well-known storyteller intended to get to the bottom of the matter.\n\nThe Absolute had an interest in finding a \"weapon\", specifically, a [[githyanki]] [[Astral Prism|artifact]] that [[Shadowheart]] (a follower of [[Shar]]) obtained through a suicidal mission in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The Absolute appeared to be guiding a set of leaders of the Cult of the Absolute: [[Minthara]], [[Dror Ragzlin]], and [[Gut]].\n\n[[File:Psyche of the Netherbrain.png|thumb|177x177px|''The psyche of the Netherbrain.'']]\nIt was later revealed that the elder brain had been a key figure in the behind-the-scenes manipulation of the Cult of the Absolute. Initially thought to be controlled by the Crown of Karsus, it was revealed that the crown was actually a catalyst for its machinations. It chose to play along with the three Chosens and their commands, offering them just enough power to play their part in its intricate plans, which involved building an illithid army.\n\nAt first, the elder brain was completely controlled by the Crown of Karsus through the Netherstones held by the three Chosen. However, when the Dark Urge was assassinated and replaced by [[Orin|Orin the Red]], this control weakened. Seizing the opportunity, the elder brain orchestrated a plan to overthrow its masters. It inserted a vision of the Astral Prism into Gortash's dreams and instilled in him a fear of its potential power. In response, Gortash commanded the elder brain to send lackeys to retrieve the Prism. Among them, the elder brain purposely sent a mind flayer known as [[Balduran|the Emperor]], a formal thrall who had escaped earlier. It had foreseen that the Emperor would find the Prism first, regain its free will, then bring other powerful allies with him, who would eventually kill the Chosen, setting the stage for its own emancipation.\n\nEvolved through the transformative powers of the Crown of Karsus and later becoming the '''Netherbrain''', it was no longer a pawn. It demonstrated its strategic genius by manipulating not only the leaders of the Cult, who had thought they were using it for their own ends, but also the Emperor. Unbeknownst to them, the Netherbrain had meticulously anticipated their actions. Contrary to their belief that it could be dominated or controlled, the elder brain required just the loosening of a single Netherstone to secure its freedom. They inadvertently played into its hands by eventually bringing all three Netherstones, setting the stage for its ultimate emancipation."
