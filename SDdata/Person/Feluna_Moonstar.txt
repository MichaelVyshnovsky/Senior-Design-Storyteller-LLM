Feluna Moonstar was a female human werecat cleric of Sel√ªne in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Feluna had many of the traits of felines, like a strong sense of independence, nocturnal habits, and a hunters mentality.
Feluna was the youngest sister of Rober Moonstar. Felunas feline power appeared during the Time of Troubles when, after being kidnapped and gagged and left in the sewers for several days, she begged the moon goddess for help and was transformed into a cat.
