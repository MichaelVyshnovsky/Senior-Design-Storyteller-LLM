'''Feluna Moonstar''' was a female [[human]] [[werecat]] [[cleric]] of [[Selûne]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Feluna had many of the traits of felines, like a strong sense of independence, nocturnal habits, and a hunter's mentality.

==History==
Feluna was the youngest sister of [[Rober Moonstar]]. Feluna's feline power appeared during the [[Time of Troubles]] when, after being kidnapped and gagged and left in the sewers for several days, she begged the moon goddess for help and was transformed into a [[cat]].
