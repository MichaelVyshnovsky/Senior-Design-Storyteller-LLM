'''Kissikit'a''' was a [[thri-kreen]] of the [[Krakk't]] tribe dwelling in the [[Rushing Hills]] on the [[Shining Plains]].

==History==
In [[Tarsakh]] in [[1370 DR]], Kissikit'a was the representative of the Krakk't to the annual meeting with representatives of the [[human]] cities of [[Assam]], [[Lheshayl]], and [[Ormath]]; the [[Emerald Enclave]]; and the centaur and [[wemic]] tribes of the Shining Plains, held on the [[Hill of Memories]]. There were reportedly tense moments between Kissikit'a and the ruler of Lheshayl, [[Entawanata]], but they and the other rulers mostly discussed trade routes, local monsters, and so on.
