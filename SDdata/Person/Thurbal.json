He was the Captain-of-Arms and Warden of Shadowdale.\nIn his role as leader of the guards of the Twisted Tower, Thurbal briefly met the young Shandril Shessair, the bearer of spellfire, when she stayed in Shadowdale for a time.\nLater, during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra, fearing the threat of the god Bane in Zhentil Keep, ordered Thurbal to go and spy on the evil city. Thurbal discovered that Bane wanted to invade Shadowdale, but he was greatly injured in his escape from Zhentil Keep. He was trapped in a recuperative sleep throughout the second battle of Shadowdale.\nAfter the battle, he awoke recovered. Thurbal was chosen by his lord to be the defendant of Adon and Midnight in a trial over the presumed death of Elminster. Thurbal was convinced of the innocence of Midnight and Adon, but the mob believed his judgement to be twisted from his time in Zhentil Keep. In the end, Midnight and Adon were condemned to death."
