        "mainbody": "'''Thurbal''' was a [[human]] commander of the guards of the [[Twisted Tower]] in [[Shadowdale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the Captain-of-Arms and Warden of Shadowdale.",
        "History": "In his role as leader of the guards of the Twisted Tower, Thurbal briefly met the young [[Shandril Shessair]], the bearer of ''[[spellfire]]'', when she stayed in Shadowdale for a time.\n\nLater, during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], fearing the threat of the god [[Bane]] in [[Zhentil Keep]], ordered Thurbal to go and spy on the evil city. Thurbal discovered that Bane wanted to invade Shadowdale, but he was greatly injured in his escape from Zhentil Keep. He was trapped in a recuperative sleep throughout the [[second battle of Shadowdale]].\n\nAfter the battle, he awoke recovered. Thurbal was chosen by his lord to be the defendant of [[Adon]] and [[Midnight]] in a trial over the presumed death of [[Elminster]]. Thurbal was convinced of the innocence of Midnight and Adon, but the mob believed his judgement to be twisted from his time in Zhentil Keep. In the end, Midnight and Adon were condemned to death.{{cite book/Tantras|15-29|1}}"
