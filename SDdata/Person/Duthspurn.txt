Duthspurn was a Zhentilar swordsman in the mid-14 century DR. His legs were recognizable.
He was known to have multiple legs, almost certainly two. His legs were easily recognizable.
He was wearing boots prior to his death. Those were not needed to recognize him.
He was under the command of Lyrkon, in a squad including the mageling Fimril. The swordmaster Lyrkon could easily recognize him by his legs.
In , Duthspurns squad struck at Shandril Shessair, with intent to capture, in Hullack Forest. As a countermeasure for her spellfire, Fimril used a spell of all-consuming darkness, which generated a slowly advancing dark band ahead of his men. Shandrils spellfire could not penetrate the barrier, but by striking under the band, she managed to disintegrate one of the mens legs he tripped forward, screaming, and fell into the band of darkness, which annihilated selectively the top half of his body.
Though their capture initially succeeded, it was at the cost of five casualties of their own, including Duthspurn himself, who had been reduced to a pair of legs. This was sufficient for his identification.
