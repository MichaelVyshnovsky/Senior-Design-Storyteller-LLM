        "mainbody": "askyr (\nMaskyr was said to be an archmage of great patience, having learned to be in his many years questing for and experimenting with magic.\nHe possessed a staff of power.\nMaskyr was already a powerful archmage when he came to explore the newly opened Vast in the 7 century DR, seeking a place well beyond human affairs where he could build himself a tower. Dwarves ruled the Vast and orcs and goblinoids were driven out and quiet, while ogres dominated Thar beyond the Moonsea to the north. Thus, humans were few in number north of the Sea of Fallen Stars, bar a few bold and cautious folk who came to explore and settle, as Maskyr did.\nOne morning in the Year of the Costly Gift, 645 DR, in the very northern end of the Vast, Maskyr came upon a wooded vale that he found quite beautiful, veiled in mountain mists and most serene. He decided to make his home there, and nowhere else.\nthumb|left|250px|Maskyr pays King Tuirs price.\nBut it was already claimed by the kingdom of Roldilar. Maskyr therefore went to Mount Grimmerfang to seek audience with Deep King Tuir Stonebeard and asked his price for the vale. The Roldilarren Court fell silent but Maskyr waited patiently, quietly leaning on his staff and meeting the kings gaze, as Tuir thought it over. Tuir did not want to yield any land to any human, particular wizards whom he distrusted, but he feared the archmages power. At last, he made his offer \"The vale is yours, from rim to rim and beneath the grass as deep as four men stand upon each others shoulders, so long as ye dig so as to remain within the valleys borders, upon one condition only. Pluck out thy right eye and give it to me, here and now, and the vale is thine.\" To the shock of all present, without hesitation, Maskyr did just that. Tuir respected Maskyr for that deed, having thought that no-one would ever do it. He kept the bargain and granted him the land. He also ordered that no dwarf trespass in the vale nor disturb the archmage. Maskyr then went and dwelled there, erecting Maskyrs Tower for his home.\nOthers followed, and this marked the beginning of permanent human settlement in the Vast.\nthumb|right|A woodcut of Maskyr the One-Eyed later in life.\nMaskyr, meanwhile, lived peacefully and alone in his tower in his vale for several centuries. Finally, he went on a journey to the planes and disappeared, and was presumed to have been slain. Elminster declared this to be false, however.\nIn time, adventurers whod heard of Maskyr and his deal with Tuir, and of his supposed absence, came to Maskyrs Tower to explore or plunder. Yet its wards proved impenetrable, so they left with nothing. Eventually, one retired adventurer of Maskyrs Eye named Gathen Swiftsword hired a crew to simply tunnel through the walls. They succeeded, sighted many oddities, Gathen was never seen again, and the tower exploded as a dragon burst out of it and flew away. That was all anyone knew, except for the thief Khonduil Ammargath, who was part of Gathens expedition, knew the truth of what happened within the tower, and escaped alive with Maskyrs staff of power. The mage Loathren of Phlan planned to build a new tower on the site, but was killed when rocks rose up and fell on his camp, and a fear of a curse on the place spread.\nBy the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Maskyr and his tower were long gone with only his name and legend surviving. His name lived on in Maskyrs Eye, the name given to the vale and the village there in The Wizards Hand inn in the village\nDespite the destruction of his tower, local tales maintained Maskyr had had much treasure and mighty magic and that it could still be concealed somewhere nearby. Yet there was also a warning, that Maskyr the One-Eyed would someday return and hunt down all those who had taken from him, even a single copper piece."
