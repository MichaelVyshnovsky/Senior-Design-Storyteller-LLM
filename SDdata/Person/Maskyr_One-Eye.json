            "Legacy": "In time, [[adventurer]]s who'd heard of Maskyr and his deal with Tuir, and of his supposed absence, came to Maskyr's Tower to explore or plunder. Yet its wards proved impenetrable, so they left with nothing. Eventually, one retired adventurer of Maskyr's Eye named [[Gathen Swiftsword]] hired a crew to simply tunnel through the walls. They succeeded, sighted many oddities, Gathen was never seen again, and the tower exploded as a [[dragon]] burst out of it and flew away.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}} That was all anyone knew, except for the thief [[Khonduil Ammargath]], who was part of Gathen's expedition, knew the truth of what happened within the tower, and escaped alive with Maskyr's ''staff of power''. The mage [[Loathren]] of [[Phlan]] planned to build a new tower on the site, but was killed when rocks rose up and fell on his camp, and a fear of a curse on the place spread.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Maskyr and his tower were long gone with only his name and legend surviving. His name lived on in [[Maskyr's Eye]], the name given to the vale and the village there; in [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn in the village;"
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Despite the destruction of his tower, local tales maintained Maskyr had had much treasure and mighty magic and that it could still be concealed somewhere nearby. Yet there was also a warning, that Maskyr the One-Eyed would someday return and hunt down all those who had taken from him, even a single [[copper piece]]."
