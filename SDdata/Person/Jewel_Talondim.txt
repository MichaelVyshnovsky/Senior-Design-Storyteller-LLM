}}'''Jewel Talondim''' was the matriarch of the [[Talondim Clan]], an independent thieves' clan in the city of [[Iriaebor]] not allied with any guild.

==Activities==
Typically, freelancers were disposed of by larger, territorial guilds, such as the [[Purple Masks Guild]]. But, due to Jewel leadership, other thieves' guilds sought to ally themselvesÂ instead.

==Personality==
She had a sharp mind and was quick-witted. She led her clan with a strong hand.

==Description==
She was a beautiful woman. She had short onyx-black hair, burnished amber skin, and dusky violet eyes.

She looked to be the same age as [[Mari Al'maren]], in around her 30s, when she was in fact 93 in [[1364 DR]]. She claimed that this was not due to magic, but good blood.
