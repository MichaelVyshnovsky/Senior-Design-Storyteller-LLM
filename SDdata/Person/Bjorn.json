        "Description": "Bjorn, son of his father of the same name, commanded a village of around 500 people. He was fairly bad tempered, but treated the citizens of Bjorn's Hold as his own family. Bjorn despised [[Luskan]], despite being a Northman, and preferred to sell his village's catches to [[Calishite]]s in [[Port Llast]].\n\nThe Northman had greying hair and a beard, and wore a green tunic that was fastened by a studded belt.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], he met with the [[Heroes of Ascore]]. Bjorn rallied his villagers and they wished them the best of fortune on their mission."
