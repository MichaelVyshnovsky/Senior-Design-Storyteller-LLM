Tharman was a human farmer from the village of Pengallen in the Silver Marches in the midâ€“14 century DR.
In the winter of the , a band of ogres and orcs attacked the village and carried off captives, including Tharmans wife and son. Tharman joined with the village leader, Rico Pengallen, and three other farmers to hunt down the group and rescue the prisoners.
The next day, the group was discovered by the drow ranger Drizzt DoUrden. Despite their fear, Tharman told the others to call off their shots and greeted Drizzt, whom hed heard of, with a handshake, and they joined forces to rescue the captives. At the raiders camp, fighting broke out, and Drizzt stopped an orc from executing Tharmans wife, while Tharman and the rest slew the remaining orcs. Tharman was happy to be reunited with his family.
Later, Tharman silently discouraged Drizzt from confronting Rico Pengallen over the death of Nojheim.
Tharman was around fifty years old in 1357, and though he was the most senior of the band, Rico Pengallen was the leader. Tharman was bothered and saddened by Ricos actions.
