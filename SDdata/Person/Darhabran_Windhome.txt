'''Darhabran Windhome''' was a caravan guard in the [[Sword Coast]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Darhabran was old.

==Personality==
He was loyal.

==Relationships==
He was an old, loyal guard of Orthil's.

==History==
Darhabran Windhome had been an old hand by {{yearlink|1357}}. Late that year he was one of [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s guards for the trip between [[Scornubel]] and [[Waterdeep]]. Before they reached [[Triel]], he was already suggesting slaying [[Shandril Shessair]], the [[spellfire]] wielder who joined their caravan, so that all those who came snatching after her would not attack it anymore. Orthil told him he'd considered it, but he needed spellfire in case of more bandits.
