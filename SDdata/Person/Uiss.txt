'''Uiss''' was the leader of the [[Order of the Snake]] in [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].

==History==
Around [[1158 DR]], the [[yuan-ti]] infiltrated the Order of the Snake.

In [[1358 DR]], the [[yuan-ti abomination]] Uiss was the leader of the clan. That year, the Snakes ordered a hunt against some people of the foreign adventuring party that accompanied [[Osari Minhiro]], as the adventurers housed the souls of members of the [[Order of the Mouse]].

At last, the adventurers confronted Uiss and his minions in their lair and defeated them.
