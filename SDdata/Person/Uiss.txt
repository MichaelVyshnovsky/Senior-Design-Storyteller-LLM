Uiss was the leader of the Order of the Snake in Fochu Peninsula in Wa.
Around 1158 DR, the yuan-ti infiltrated the Order of the Snake.
In 1358 DR, the yuan-ti abomination Uiss was the leader of the clan. That year, the Snakes ordered a hunt against some people of the foreign adventuring party that accompanied Osari Minhiro, as the adventurers housed the souls of members of the Order of the Mouse.
At last, the adventurers confronted Uiss and his minions in their lair and defeated them.
