'''Villonah Leadstopper''' was an agent of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] that lived in [[Phlan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
After the passing of her mother, Villonah regularly got into trouble with the law, albeit in cases involving minor crimes. She was often saved by her father [[Rillo Leadstopper]], who paid for the damage she caused. In truth, she had joined secretly the Order of the Gauntlet and worked for them.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|27}}

One day in the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Villonah and her fellow [[Yllivia]] allowed themselves to be captured by [[Knights of the Black Fist]] in order to find a map that showed a secret [[white dragon]] lair. However, they were transported to a secret prison where corrupt Black Fists tortured prisoners for sport. Villonah was saved by adventurers hired by her father.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|29}}
