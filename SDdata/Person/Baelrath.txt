Baelrath the Vile was a pit fiend that was summoned to Faer√ªn by the Ashmadai during the late 15 century DR.
In battle, Baelrath would hurl balls of fire and conjure columns of flame around its foes.
In addition to his cultist servitors, the great pit fiend was attended by dozens of fluttering imps.

After Ashmadai cultists had taken over the city of Helms Hold during the 1470s DR, several of the devil-worshipers made their way to the crypts found beneath the Cathedral of Helm. Just after their Prophet Rohini was slain upon the cathedrals altar, the Ashmadai in the catacombs managed to complete the ritual to bring forth Baelrath to the Prime Material Plane, warping the stone and earth around their summoning circle.
The great pit fiend enjoyed a short stay on the Prime however, as it was nearly immediately slain by the same heroes that struck down the cults prophet moments earlier.
