'''Elizabeth Clawthorn''' was an inhabitant of in the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was called '''Mother Clawthorn''' or '''Looney Liz''' by the townsfolk; they thought she was a witch, but she was only very old and absentminded.

==Description==
She was very frail and slow-moving, and shrunken to almost a [[dwarf]]'s height. Her teeth were yellow or black or absent and her hair long and dirty. She had [[cataract]]s that clouded her eyes and obscured her sight. She wore an unwashed smock.

==Personality==
At her great age, her wits were said to be wandering; at times she was lucid, but at others she acted strangely, and she mistook people and things for others.

==Relations==
She once had a husband and a son named [[Jamie]].

==Home==
She lived about {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} to the south of Ghars, in a small cottage that had become dilapidated. The walls needed painting, greasy hides were used to cover the windows, and [[wreath]]s of dead flowers hung on the walls and door. While Liz had an [[apple]] tree and grew vegetables such as [[lettuce]], [[potato]]es, and [[tomato]]es in a small garden by the side, the drought that struck Ghars in 1367 DR meant these grew poorly or died. A dead [[dog]] lying by one withered tree completed the bleak appearance. The inside was little better, being  unclean and smelly.

==History==
On the night of [[Flamerule 8]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Liz saw the axe-wielding ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]] that had been appearing to townsfolk that summer. She fled at first but then returned, having mistaken it for her long-deceased husband and wanting to remind him to mend a [[bucket]]. After following the apparition, she realized her error when she saw it had a "golden hand" and hid in case it ate her. She watched this ghost wave to another golden-handed ghost in the Vast Swamp. She later told her story in town. And of course few believed her.

Some time after, Liz offered a dead [[cat]] in trade for a [[linen]] tablecloth at [[Bryn Goldtooth]]'s store, but he declined. She did share some of the story of her ghost sighting, however.

Later that year, on [[Eleint 18]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] visited Liz at her cottage to ask about her sighting, as part of his investigation into the killings of [[Dovo]] (who was impersonating the ghost) and [[Grodoveth]]. He brought her [[bread]] and vegetables (she mistook the [[carrot]]s for [[orange]]s) and briefly mistook him for her son Jamie. From her account, he realized the ghosts' golden hands were actually [[lantern]]s seen through her obscured sight.
