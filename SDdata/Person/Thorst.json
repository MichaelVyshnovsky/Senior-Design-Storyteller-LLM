Orthil also knew he had been between Shandril Shessair and the burned body of the late guard Storstil, which helped him figure out Shandril hadnt been the killer. He fought alongside Shandril in protecting their wagon afterwards. He was badly injured during the fight, but spoke up in Shandrils defense, as she resorted to spellfire to fight back against his assailants and protect him."
