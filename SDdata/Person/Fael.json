He wore a set of enchanted +1 leather armor and wielded a war hammer.\nFael traded in his humble stock of common potions and a small collection of books, including tomes about Halruaa, Zhentarim, waterdeep, and the Drow. In the , the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances, and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary Umar Witch. Fael was worried by the disappearances but, even more so, was alerted by the disappearance of the local ranger protector Merella, who disappeared after venturing into the hills in search of the first victim of disappearances. However, in reality, he cared naught for local peasants and was working discreetly with Rejiek Hidesman, a serial killer, to create a heinous enchanted item on behalf of the Twisted Rune â€“ a set of armor called the Human Flesh. It was, indeed, made out of human flesh."
