        "Description": "Fael was a [[human]] man with light skin and light chestnut hair. He wore a set of [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[war hammer]].",
        "History": "Fael traded in his humble stock of common [[potion]]s and a small collection of [[book]]s, including tomes about [[Halruaa]], [[Zhentarim]], [[waterdeep]], and the [[Drow]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances, and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary [[Umar Witch]]. Fael was worried by the disappearances but, even more so, was alerted by the disappearance of the local [[ranger]] protector [[Merella]], who disappeared after venturing into the hills in search of the first victim of disappearances. However, in reality, he cared naught for local peasants and was working discreetly with [[Rejiek Hidesman]], a serial killer, to create a heinous enchanted item on behalf of the Twisted Rune â€“ a set of armor called the ''[[Human Flesh]]''. It was, indeed, made out of human flesh."
