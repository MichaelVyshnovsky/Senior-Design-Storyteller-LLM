        "mainbody": "'''Arrayan Faylin''' was a female [[half-orc]] [[wizard]] who lived in [[Palischuk]], in the northeastern region of [[Vaasa]].<ref>",
        "Description": "Arrayan's appearance favored her human half of her heritage, however, her features combined the most attractive qualities of all her racial aspects. Her reddish-brown hair was long and soft, flowing as if her face was framed by a soft red halo. She was short, like many orcs, but because of her mixed blood, Arrayan was far from stocky, and had delicate shoulders. Her face was somewhat orc-like, but set with human-like large emerald green eyes, thick lips, narrow angled eyebrows and a button nose.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], she was in her mid-twenties. She often wears leather [[breeches]] and a vest, and a thin belt with several pouches for her spell components, as well as a set of writing components. Sometimes she dons a blue robe of light material over her clothes, held together at her waist by the belt.",
        "History": "Arrayan had human and orc blood in her, and also some elf, so her mother told her. As a teenager, Arrayan learned her wizardly craft in a wizard's tower in [[Damara]].<ref>\n\nAround [[1368 DR]], Arrayan received one of [[Zhengyi]]'s writings from her uncle, [[Wingham]], to study.<ref> However, her life-force triggered the unleashing of the Witch-King's power and the book started to create a replica of [[Castle Perilous]] in due course draining Arrayan of her life-force. Arrayan, along with her companion [[Olgerkhan]], and a troupe under command of [[Ellery Dragonsbane]] set out to unravel the mystery of book and castle and save her life. Her uncle gave her and Olgerkhan [[ring of arbitration|rings of arbitration]] so that the drain of her life-force could be compensated by Olgerkahn's own. After the defeat of the castle and its dweomers, Arrayan and Olgerkhan returned to Palischuk.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "Arrayan had known Olgerkhan for all her life but only during the crisis within the construct of Zhengyi had she come to understand the truth of her feelings for him."
