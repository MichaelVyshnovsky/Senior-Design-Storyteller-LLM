        "Description": "Khorrl was bald and wielded an [[orc double axe]].",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Clan Xornbane was hired by the [[Ched Nasad]]an [[drow]] [[House Zauvirr]] through a liaison named [[Zammzt]] (secretly an agent of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]). The band was to fight and destroy [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]]. However, Zammzt instructed them to attack too early. They successfully killed [[Matron Mother]] [[Drisinil Melarn]] but House Zauvirr's captives escaped and the duergar contributed to the chaos in Ched Nasad that led to its ultimate destruction. Matron Mother [[Ssipriina Zauvirr]] attacked Khorrl, killing him; the band fled the city."
