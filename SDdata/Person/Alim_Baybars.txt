Alim Baybars lived on the island of Kaff in the Djinnis Claws in 1367 DR.
Alims face and body were ruined from constant exposure to humid air, dark magic, and his own obsessive pursuit of power.
Alim was a rare Zakharan in that he willingly departed the Land of Fate in search of powerful magic to give him mastery over the dead.
Alim left Zakhara at a young age in search of dreadful magic. He returned to Zakhara centuries later to the island of Kaff where he could practice his dark art in secrecy.
Alim was skilled in the use of the sword and necromantic magic.
Alim owned a ring of mind shielding, a wand of fire, a caftan of protection , a crystal ball, and a ring of regeneration.
Alim had one daughter, Melisende Baybars, who wished to kill him.
