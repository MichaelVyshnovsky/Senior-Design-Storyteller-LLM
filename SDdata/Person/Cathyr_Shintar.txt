Cathtyr Shintar was a half-elven priestess and eventually the first Queen of Dambrath during the 9 century DR.
Cathtyrs daughter was named Filina.
Cathtyr Shintar, along with a large group of fellow priestesses, appeared to come to the rescue of Reinhar IX while he was corned by drow in the city of Malduir.
Cathtyr offered the support of her priestesses. Reinhar IX believed this to be a sign from the gods and had a priestess assigned to each of his remaining companies. When the drow attacked, the priestesses within each company betrayed the Arkaiuns. Cathtyr slew Reinhar IX herself during the betrayal. 
The drow, weakened by decades of war, realized their victory was only possible because of the aid from Cathtyrs priestesses. Cathtyr recognized an opportunity and made a deal with the drow that her group of priestesses would rule the surface land of Dambrath in exchange for free trade with the drow.
Tired from war, and having no interested in the surface territory, the drow gladly agreed. The drow departed, taking the best Arkaiun males as their slaves.
Cathtyr ruled as Dambtraths queen for 205 years, transforming the kingdom into the Nation of Pain. She added thousands of members to the clergy of her god Loviatar. The worship of ancient beastlords by the Arkaiun was all but wiped  out. Small groups of Arkaiun were able to escape to the Swagdar where the resumed their nomadic lifestyle.
Cathtyr was killed by her daughter, Filina Shintar in the .
Many priestesses of Loviatar mated with the drow, eventually creating a race of half-elves known as the Crinti, or Noble Ones.
