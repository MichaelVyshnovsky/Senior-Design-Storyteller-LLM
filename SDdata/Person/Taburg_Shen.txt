'''Taburg Shen''' was a farmer who lived in the village of [[Eveningstar]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a respectful, quiet, and introverted man.

==Activities==
Tabard's farm and [[apple]] orchard were located along the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] on the western outskirts of Eveningstar. Apart from apples, Taburg grew [[mushroom]]s, various food crops, and hay. Apart from apples, he dealt in tree grafts and [[herb]]s. The farmer's home was elevated above the ground on pilings, and underneath was the entrance to the extensive cellars used for mushroom farming. The farm's herbs and local wildflowers were used in distilling a potent medicinal [[wine]] that possessed impressive pain-killing properties.

==History==
Long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the Shen family migrated to [[Cormyr]] from [[Durpar]], by way of [[Chessenta]]. Tabard's father was [[Thontravur Shen]] and mother â€“ [[Velveira Almarrand]], a [[Sembian]] merchant noblewoman. Taburg's sister, [[Randarla Shen]], was an adventuring sort who eventually met her end on [[Zhentarim]] blades, after joining [[Harpers]]. Taburg met and moon married [[Shalarla Shen|Shalarla]], a strong Dalesfolk, with whom they sired three daughters: [[Haethe Shen|Haethe]], [[Raedaerle Shen|Raedaerle]], and [[Tarsarra Shen|Tarsarra]].

Taburg died first between the spouses. Shalarla outlived the man and survived well into her twilight years. Still, eventually, both were buried on the farm by the Shen daughters, who decided to stay unmarried and run the farm while aiding elves of [[Cormanthor]] against Zhents in their spare time.
