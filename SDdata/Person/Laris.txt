Laris was a merchant and the proprietor of Lariss Curios within the city of Hillsfar during the midâ€“14 century DR. He dealt in art, gems, and all sorts of curios.
He was known for being a particularly rude and all-around unpleasant man.
Shortly after the Thayan enclave was established in Hillsfar in 1371 DR, Laris reportedly greatly offended either the Red Plumes or Maalthiir himself in some manner, and was thrown into the citys arena. The behir he faced proved to be quite the deadly opponent.
Laris used his ring of golem control to command a pair of stone golems that guarded his shop.
