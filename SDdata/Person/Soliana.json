        "mainbody": "falcon\nSoliana, also known as Princess Soliana of Fanloc, was a falcon magically transformed into a human and adopted by the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh in the late 14 century DR.\nSoliana was a beautifully radiant redhead woman who often wore gowns of green fabric. She had delicate features, especially evident when her hands were locked with the large rough hands of her beloved Griswald. Her movements were flowing and elegant like that of a flying bird.\nSoliana was a naive romantic and a kind young woman who came off as enigmatic to most people due to the fairytale-inspired lies of her fictitious far away kingdom home of Fanloc.\nSoliana always carried her enchanted necklace made for her by the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh.\nSome years before the , a daring warrior snuck into the lair of the notorious Green Hag of Lizard Marsh with murder and greed in his eyes. The hag befriended the swamps critters, one of whom saw the intruder. The falcon unleashed a loud screech, waking the napping hag and saving her life. Thankful, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh polymorphed the falcon into a young human lass she named Soliana. The new daughter was the apple of the hags eye. Even though the falcon-maid liked her human existence, the Green Hag crafted an enchanted necklace for her daughter. Suppose Soliana were ever to grow tired of being a human, she only needed to whisper \"rablak\" three times into the necklace to be returned to her original feathered form, oblivious of her humanoid existence. They were close. The hag spent countless nights at the swamp listening to toads croak, brushing the childs long brown locks. The hairbrush was a sentimental trinket, a hand-made gif from Soliana. Eventually, the daughter matured and ran away in search of a fairytale romance and a handsome prince. Her search brought the falcon-lass to the city of Baldurs Gate. She arrived at the city with nothing but a chest full of rare gems.\nIn the winter of , Soliana met a gruff but kind and handsome noble knight of Baldurs Gate named Sir Griswald. Along with Griswald, several nobles quickly found themselves fascinated with the \"princess,\" competing for her affections and hand in marriage. One such admirer was conniving Feldran Exeltis, who wanted Solianas fictional riches. Young Exeltis tricked Griswald into venturing away from the Gate and quickly swept in and convinced gullible Soliana that Sir Griswald abandoned her for the Moonshae Isles. Feldran lured Soliana with lies and promises of rich noble life to his familys holding â€“ Castle Exeltis on the Blade Cliffs outside the city of Daggerford, where she became unknowingly imprisoned. When Sir Griswald discovered his beloved gone, he assembled his familys mercenaries and laid siege on Castle Exeltis but could not cross the cliffside moat. Lord Exeltis informed Griswald that Soliana loved him not and did not wish to see him. The honorable knight refused to believe such an outrageous tale and demanded \"princess\" to tell it to his face. Desperate for help and growing overwhelmed with despair, Griswald sent his young page to fetch a hero who was recently gifted holdings in the town of Liams Hold.\nSoliana did not realize she was in captivity as she trusted Feldran because of his charisma, wealth, education, and promise to teach her the meaning of being a noble, like in all the fairytales her hag mother recited back in the Lizard Marsh. When Sir Griswald started the siege, Feldran Exeltis announced that a monstrous barbarian horde was outside the castle moat and locked the woman in her tower \"for her own safety.\"\nSir Griswald implored the Hero of Daggerford to sneak into the impregnable castle and lower the drawbridge, allowing the Griswald Knights to storm the stronghold. Even though it was unknown if the Hero was successful, some stories claimed that he managed to sneak inside the castle through an old sewer cavern underneath the cliffside castle. If that were true, Sir Griswald was sure to have had confronted the Exeltis lordling putting an end to his life, and reuniting with his beloved. Soliana realized she would never need her mothers enchanted necklace and gifted it to the Hero of Daggerford as a small token of her eternal gratitude."
