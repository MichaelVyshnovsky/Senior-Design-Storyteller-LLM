'''Bevis the Illuminator''' was a scribe

==Personality==
While Bevis was quite skilled at illustrating [[tome]]s, he absolutely hated his job. The annoyances of ink stains that covered his hands, the acrid smell of paint and inevitable wrist cramps made his chosen profession insufferable.

==Activities==
He worked as an illuminator for over 15 years, adding artistic depictions to what were otherwise dry and boring texts. He much preferred working on 'penitentials', religious works that depicted scenes of the afterlife to those that were penitent. They gave him opportunity to paint vivid depictions of how he imagined the [[denizen]]s of the [[City of Strife]] in [[Hades]].

==Relationships==
Bevis was the father of [[Rinda]], an especially skilled scribe of Zhentil Keep.

==History==
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Bevis was hired by the [[church of Cyric]] to illustrate a tome that depicted scenes from the [[Time of Troubles]], the year when the [[Faerûnian pantheon|gods of Faerûn]] walked as mortals on [[Toril]].

The book Bevis received was one of the early drafts of the ''[[Cyrinishad]]''. Bevis read the entire book,

After his death, Bevis' soul languished as one of the [[Burning Men]] that hung from within Cyric's palace in the City of Strife.
