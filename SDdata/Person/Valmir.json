        "mainbody": "almir was one of the Blades of the Old Man in the fortress of Sentinelspire. He was a part of the team accompanying Sauk to look for Kheil and secure the Eraellen in the Northern Shalhoond, conspiring to kill the Old Man of the Mountain.\nValmir was very talkative, annoying his comrades quite often. He was also enough of a charmer to gain the attentions of Talieth, and even get her to teach him magic. He was also quite curious, especially about Talieths former lovers.\nValmir was tall, blond, and had much stubble.\nValmir could cast fireball, as Talieth taught him. Before meeting her, he was able to cast a number of other spells, including remove scent, knock, and likely silence.\nValmir was originally a thief from Darromar. After a falling out with his guild, he moved around Tethyr, where he learned some of the Art. Somehow, he impressed Merzan while on the run from a noble, who offered him an audition with Alaodin, a few years before . He had become Talieths lover since.\nKerlis, Valmir and Dren stayed behind to watch Berun and Lewan when Sauk decided to hunt down some yaqubi, expecting them to be carrying gold.\nWhen in Sentinelspire, he employed a fireball to release Talieth and Sauk from their vine bindings at the Tower of the Sun on the night of Tarsakh 25. He survived the whole evening."
