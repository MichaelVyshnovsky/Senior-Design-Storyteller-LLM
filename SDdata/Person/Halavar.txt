Halavar was a well-known arcanist and archwizard of the enclave of Palter in Netheril during its Mythallar Era, in the 3 millennium before Dale Reckoning.
As ruler of Palter, he was well-liked by the people.
However, he spent most of his time performing puppetry with a collage of marionettes and punchinellos to entertain children and young men and women. His shows presented criticisms of Netherese lifestyle, tragedies about past Netherese warrior heroes, and satires of current prominent people and fellow archwizards, which regularly caused strife with Netherils government.
Most famously, he created a magical item called Halavars universal pantograph, which allowed him to reproduce his puppets and marionettes. Through a strange twist of fate, however, the device could also copy just about anything that could fit in the box, even living matter, effectively cloning people with their personalities intact. The pantograph was a small box, about  on a side, that was made of oak and bound in silver. It was engraved with marionettes and laughing children. Any item placed within the pantograph was duplicated the moment the lid was closed, creating an exact duplicate that appeared next to the box. It only worked once per day. Living creatures (shrunk down to fit) could also be duplicated, like a clone spell.
He was born in 974 NY (−2885 DR).
When it was found that the universal pantograph could clone people, even children, angry devotees of Selûne and Tyche revolted against Palter. Halavar escaped a lynch mob and the city, but in 1068 NY (−2791 DR) he was killed by bandits who coveted the universal pantograph and used his creation to get rich.
