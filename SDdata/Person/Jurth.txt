Jurth was an orog member of the Cult of the Black Earth during the Elemental Evil crisis.
In 1491 DR, Jurth was at the Sacred Stone Monastery. Soon after, however, some adventurers infiltrated the monastery and in the end confronted and defeated Jurth and his minions.
Jurth led two other orogs and the ogre Drool in acting as subterranean guards and jailers at the monastery.
