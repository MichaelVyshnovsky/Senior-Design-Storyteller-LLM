Knellict was the archmage of Vaasa, an advisor to Zhengyi the Witch King, and later a member of the Citadel of Assassins in the 14 century DR.
He was usually brooding and quiet, and seemed emotionless.
Though his true age and origins were unknown, Knellict was generally assumed to be over two or three centuries old as of the mid–1300s DR.
For several decades, Knellict was an advisor to the king of Vaasa. But the king feared Knellicts power and tried to have him assassinated. The archmage survived, and so did the assassins—albeit polymorphed into cockroaches.
After the attempt on his life, Knellect left service to the king and became the principle advisor to Zhengyi himself. However, even the Witch King feared him and so transferred him to the Citadel of Assassins to serve the Grandfather of Assassins instead. In this capacity, Knellict was part of the bandit army sent against Bloodstone Village as part of Zhengyis war between Vaasa and Damara.
After Zhengyis fall at the hands of Gareth Dragonsbane and party, Knellict remained with the Citadel of Assassins, where he was second only to Timoshenko. In some ways, Knellict was the real power within the Citadel since Timoshenko generally followed all of Knellicts advice, such as forming ties to the Tightpurse thieves guild in Heliogabalus, and Knellict had free reign to do as he pleased.
In the , the Citadel of Assassins was once again brought under the influence of another power. This time it was the mercenary band, Bregan Daerthe from Menzoberranzan. With minimal effort Jarlaxle and the powerful psionicist, Kimmuriel Oblodra, subdued Knellict and persuaded him to swear loyalty to Bregan Daerthe. Quietly raging inside, Knellict agreed to Jarlaxles demands...for now.
