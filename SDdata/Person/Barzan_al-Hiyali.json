He did actually care for the soldiers under his command at the keep.\nBarazan recognized the military genius of Khaizuran, a warmonger genie, though he secretly detested him.\nIn order to protect the honor of his family, Barzan staged his own death in Hiyal once it was discovered that he took bribes. He allied himself with the Brotherhood of the True Flame out of desperation after leaving Hiyal.\nBarzan owned a magical shield and longsword, a set of armor of the desert evening,\nand a few healing potions."
