Von was a mad shield dwarf residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.
As a kid, Von created a imaginary friend Aldo but he claimed that Aldo was always at his side even in adult days.
For a time, Von worked as a valet and food taster for King Korin Ironaxe.
Later, Von hid himself in a secret room where he established an alchemical distillery.
Around 1479 DR, Von killed his fellow dwarf Larloss after he inadvertently discovered Vons secret laboratory.
Von was mad, he followed all the advice of his friend Aldo, who lived only in his mind. If approached gently, he was not dangerous but easily believed all people to be intruders.
Von and Aldo were inseparable, or so Von thought.
