'''Bethla''' was a [[priest]]ess of [[Ilmater]] in the late-13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Tremble baby keep home in the vast fall of peace wind crushing days of [[oil]] and murder...''|Bethla, while [[dominate person|mentally dominated]] by the idol in [[Dorn's Deep]] in [[1281 DR]].}}

==History==
Prior to [[1281 DR]], Bethla lived in an Ilmatari [[monastery]] that was located just outside of [[Illefarn]]. On that year Incylia and the rest of her fellow clergymen had their minds ''[[dominate person|dominated]]'' by an Ilmtari priest named Poquelin, who in reality was the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]] in disguise.Belhifet is erroneously referred to as a demon in both ''[[Icewind Dale (game)|Icewind Dale]]'' and ''[[Icewind Dale II]]''. This is overridden by the later sources [[Dragon magazine 278|''Dragon'' #278]] and ''[[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear]]'', where he is referred to as a devil.

Mesmerized by Poquelin, Bethla and the other Ilmatari followed him north into the region of [[Icewind Dale]]. They then traveled through the [[Kuldahar Pass]], losing many of their fellow clergymen along the way, and down into the ruins of the [[dwarven]] fortress [[Dorn's Deep]].

In the Lower Depths of these ruins she and four others were instructed to guard the [[Magic item|magical]] idol inside what had once been a temple to the [[dwarven pantheon|dwarven god]] [[Berronar Truesilver]]. While guarding the idol she and the other Ilmatari were individually surrounded by a magical barrier. Overtime they watched as Poquelin became more militant and fascist, but the magic of the idol had them too enthralled to resist and made them believe his words superseded the gospel of Ilmatar. Those outside the idol's range tried to resist him and for their efforts were transformed into [[undead]] guardians for the idol, such as [[boneguard]]s, [[mummies]], and [[zombie]]s.

Eventually, a group of [[adventurer]]s arrived that year and destroyed the idol, thus freeing Bethla and the rest of her fellow Ilmatari from its dominating effect. Once freed Bethla was deeply remorseful for the actions she had committed while under its domination and prayed for forgiveness from Ilmater.
