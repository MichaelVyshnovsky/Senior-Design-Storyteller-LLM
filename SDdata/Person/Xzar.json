        "mainbody": "Xzar was an insane necromancer and a member of the Zhentarim who traveled the Sword Coast during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nXzar was both intelligent and insane at the same time. He was quite unbalanced and would randomly spout gibberish at unpredictable moments at one moment he could act like a frightened child while the next he may remark that he ate another persons liver paired with beans and a nice wine.\nHis treatment of others was usually coldly disdainful or derisive.\nThe Zhentarim partnered Xzar with the halfling Montaron, a pairing that was made against both their wishes. Xzar found Monty to be quite insufferable, while he in turn thought Xzar completely mad. After some time however, it appeared as if the two had developed genuine care for one another.\nIn the , Xzar and Montaron were tasked by the Zhentarim to investigate the iron crisis that plagued the Sword Coast. They traveled south along the Coast Way to the Amnian town of Nashkel.In the Baldurs Gate (novel), Xzar and Montaron rescue Abdel Adrian from a horde of gibberlings before joining him on his journey to the Friendly Arm Inn and Nashkel.\nBy the , Xzar and Montaron had traveled to Athkatla to spy on the local group of Harpers led by Galvarey. At that time Xzar had employed a pair of apprentices, Prebek and Sanasha. The trio were conducting experiments involving the creation of horrific monsters.\nMontaron was captured by the Harpers at some point and to Xzars knowledge was taken to the local Harper Hold. While Xzar sought a means to rescue his friend, Montaron had in fact already been killed. In the same novel, Xzar and Montraon never make it to Athkatla, but are slain by Sarevok during the Iron Crisis."
