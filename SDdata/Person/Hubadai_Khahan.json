        "mainbody": "Prince Hubadai Khahan was a Tuigan warrior and the son of Yamun Khahan during the mid 14 century DR.\nStanding over six feet tall, Hubadai was powerfully-built, with a scarred, broad face that sported a trim mustache and beard. His eyes were described as piercing.\nHubadai was a strict commander, making him a challenging enemy. He was a loyal friend to those whom he trusted. He valued human life less than commanders from other cultures, allowing him to sacrifice troops in order to achieve his goals. He was a capable leader who was not afraid to join the fighting with his men. The driving force behind all of Hubadais actions was the desire to please his father. People found him charmingly arrogant, and after his fathers death, his motivation was to prove his peoples faith in him was not unfounded.\nHubadai owned a suit of magical lamellar armor, a magical sword, a ring of protection, a ring of teleportation, and a helm of reflection.\nHubadai founded the nation of Yaïmmunahar three years after the death of his father, establishing the capital of Kourmira in 1367 DR.\nDuring the Horde War, Hubadai was tasked by his father with the conquest of Semphar, which he accomplished with relative ease.\nAfter the Tuigan loss at the conclusion of the Horde War, Hubadai did not immediately return home to the Endless Waste. Instead, he secretly visited several nations and cities over the next three years, including Cormyr, Sembia, Waterdeep, and Zhentil Keep, intending to learn from the people who had defeated his own. He determined that their loss was due to the fact that the Tuigan were not unified as a nation. When he returned home in the , he declared himself khahan, and founded the nation of Yaïmmunahar. He won the support of the Commani, Naican, and Oigur tribes, then set to work building his new realm."
