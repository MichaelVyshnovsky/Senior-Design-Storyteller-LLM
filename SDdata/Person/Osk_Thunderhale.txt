'''Osk Thunderhale''' was a sea captain sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Relationship==
Osk was at the employ of Lord [[Dagult Neverember]].

==Activities==
Osk sailed with his ship the "[[Moon Maiden]]" from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Luskan]] and back. Often he was at the [[Hanging Lantern]] festhall in [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]]. He was a skilled fiddler and loved playing his fiddle to amuse his crew and the others festhall patrons'.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]] Osk saw on sea debris of the "[[Dancing Wave]]" ship and a giant warship nearby. Possibly he was contacted by an adventuring party hired by [[Duvessa Shane]].
