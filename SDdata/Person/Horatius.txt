'''Horatius''' was one of the members of the wealthy high society of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Horatius set his eyes and amorous ambitions on Lady [[Firelia Jannath]], one of the city's [[patriar]]s and a notable patroness of the arts. The couple was known to meet on occasion and sip [[tea]]. He was among suitors who fought for the lady's hand in [[1492 DR]], when her lover, [[Oskar Fevras]], was presumed missing or killed, in reality, captured and enslaved by the [[Zhentarim]] smugglers.
