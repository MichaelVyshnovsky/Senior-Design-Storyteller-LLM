'''Jeorna''' was a [[druid]] member of the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Force my hand, and I'll show you its claws.}}

==Personality==
Jeorna was a strong willed individual that firmly believed in the use of force to protect that which nature held most dear. While perhaps quick to anger, she was not unreasonable and abided by the hierarchy of authority within her druidic circle.

==History==
{{Quote|She's a thief hellspawn. And you will wait for Kagha's judgement. Now get back.|Jeorna, to [[Marricko]].}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Archdruid Halsin allowed a group of [[tiefling]]s that were exiled from [[Elturel]] to temporarily take up residence within the Emerald Grove. Tensions rose among the druids of the grove, but reached a breaking point after Halsin took it upon himself to venture out into the [[Sword Coast]] to investigate strange events associated with [[mind flayer]]s and the dark locale of [[Moonrise Towers]].

When the druid Kagha took over temporary leadership, the strained circumstances made worse when she called to expel the tiefling refugees out into the world once more. A tiefling child [[Arabella]] stole the ''[[idol of Silvanus]]'' from the grove's sacred pool, preventing Kagha and those agreeable to her cause from performing the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'' to shield their home from outsiders. A nerve-wracking standoff broke out as Jeorna and two of her fellow druids were forced to hold back Arabella's parents from entering the grove's inner sanctum, while Kagha questioned the young tiefling with the "assistance" of her viper [[Teela]].
