Blackland Ironhoof was a centaur who ran the Agri Plantation in Thay circa 1362 DR and was the father of Wynter.
Blackland ran the biggest plantation in northern Thay. He taught his son Wynter the plantation business until the young centaur rebelled and left Thay out of disdain for the countrys slavery.
Blackland was a proud Thavian who felt deeply patriotic towards his country and its ways. He had no hesitation beating slaves and killing the ones who were too old or sick to work.
He feared the Zulkir of Necromancy Szass Tam yet hoped the lich would take over the tharchion where the plantation was located as working for a powerful necromancer meant power for Blackland himself.
Around 1352 DR, Blacklands son Wynter left the plantation his father worked at and left Thay, eventually becoming a Harper.
By 1362 DR Blackland Ironhoof had been running the plantation for some time, making almost all of his slave purchasing in Eltabbar, while the Agri Plantation had a good slave breeding program in place.
