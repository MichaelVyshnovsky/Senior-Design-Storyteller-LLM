        "Activities": "Tyssaklera claimed to be the queen of all faerie dragons of [[Faerun]], despite the fact that most of her kind in the [[Realms]] had never even heard her name. She was so old that she herself had forgotten her exact age. Tyssaklera lived in a massive [[oak]] near [[Farmeadows]], attended by a dozen faerie dragons of various ages.",
        "Personality": "Tyssaklera was more serious than most of her kind, thanks to her old age. She still enjoyed pranks but sometime she thought of serious matters like how to protect Evermeet or having good dealings with Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]].",
