Lionar Rorlyn Handmane was a high-ranking officer of the Purple Dragons in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.
He was a Lionar among the Purple Dragons.
After the explosion at the mansion of the archmage Larak Dardulkyn, Rorlyn Handmane was sent by the War Wizards to investigate and offer reasonable aid, mindful that he may not wish to have his home surveyed by fellow workers of the Art. He was coldly dismissed by Dardulkyn, who was at the moment mind-ridden by the evil vampire archmage Manshoon.
