        "mainbody": "'''Kalas Winters''' was the innkeeper and owner of the [[Wolf's Pelt Inn]] in the [[Icewind Dale]] community of [[Targos]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Kalas Winters was a 39-year-old man, very tall ({{SI|6'3|'\"|long=yes}}), and muscular ({{SI|215|lb|k|long=yes}}). He had reddish-brown hair, brown eyes like the rest of his family, and a thick beard. He usually dressed in dark green and brown clothes that showed signs of age.",
        "Personality": "Kalas was a friendly and polite man. He gladly shared tales of his adventures with anyone who listened.\n\nEven though his inn had a few candles inside, Kalas frowned on their use, in fear of fire.",
        "Relationships": "Kalas Winters took care of his family well. He kept a close eye on his spritely and willful daughter Dorthy to keep her out of trouble.",
        "Possessions": "Kalas wore his simple thin gold band ''+2 [[ring of protection]]'' on the left hand's index finger. He had a magical ''+2 [[dagger]]'' tucked in his waist, and he also kept his magical ''+1 [[long sword]]'' close by behind the bar in case of trouble.",
        "History": "Around [[Tarsakh]], [[1369 DR]], Kalas lived with his family in the [[Ten Towns]] and ran his inn. Wolf's Pelt Inn was busy with fishermen, dockworkers, and adventurers, and it was well-managed, clean, and welcoming.\n\nKalas had a standing agreement with a trader and caravaneer named [[Boswell Peddywinkle]] to house the guards and adventurers hired by him."
