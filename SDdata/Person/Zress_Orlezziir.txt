Zress Orlezziir was the bodyguard of Vlonwelv Auvryndar of House Auvryndar in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Zress was totally devoted to Vlonwelv.
She was usually in the main temple together with Vlonwelv, or in Vlonwelvs private apartments.
Zress was always at the side of Vlonwelv, together with her yochlol advisor Chalizana. Vlonwelv trusted Zress more than her children.
When House Orlezziir was destroyed, Zress was adopted by Vlonwelv. She remained by her side at all times thereafter.
