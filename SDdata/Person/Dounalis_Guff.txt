'''Dounalis Guff''' was the High Priest of [[Tempus]] at the [[Vault of Swords]] in [[Hillsfar]]. He also served as the chaplain for the city's military force, the [[Red Plumes]].

A gruff and loud man in his mid-forties by [[1374 DR]], Dounalis believed that salvation from cowardice could only be found through death on the battlefield.
