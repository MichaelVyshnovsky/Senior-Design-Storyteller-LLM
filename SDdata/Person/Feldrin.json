Moreover, I have good information that at least three ambitious lordlings of Laothkund will ride here with the best mercenaries they can muster if we do take up arms 'gainst each other, to carve away all of Galadorna that they can hold. These three have a pact, their men shall never turn on each other whilst any of us live.|Baron Feldrin in 764 DR}}",
        "Description": "The thin, weak-looking man had a customary sly smile and rarely met anyone's gaze with his big brown eyes. He wore fine clothes, but they didn't fit him right, and kept his black hair short. His breath smelled of [[parsley]].",
        "Relationships": "His men wore scarlet, and many were hired from abroad. He sought the death of [[Maethor]], and supported Baron [[Hothal]].",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|764}}, Baron Feldrin initially supported the bid by Baron Hothal to become king, and make peace with [[Laothkund]] by giving them the mines of [[iron]] and [[silver]] in the forest. But after Baron Tholone's bid overwhelmed Hothal's in support, he backed Baron Tholone to ascend to the throne of Galadorna, in exchange for Hothal being executed on the spot and Maethor's future assassination. In any case, the king and Tholone were both eliminated with a spell by Court Mage [[Ilgrist]] right in the middle of pronouncing Tholone king, and Baron Feldrin was caught in the blast, slaying him instantly.",
        "Reputation": "He was known as a restless trickster who spent lavishly and often."
