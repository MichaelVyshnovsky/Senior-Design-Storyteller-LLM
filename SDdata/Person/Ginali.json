        "mainbody": "Ginali was a servant of the High Imperceptor of Bane, known himself as the High Inquisitor of Bane, and an orthodox Banite.\nIn 1357 DR, he was charged with conducting an investigation into the fitness of Fzoul Chembryl to be head of the church in the West Moonsea region. Once it was clear that Fzoul would not rejoin the orthodox church, in an effort to persuade his followers to abandon him. Ginali and his followers briefly took over the Black Altar, while Fzoul was distracted by the attempted capture of Shandril Shessair, but was evicted when Fzoul refocused on the goings-on in the Keep. In response, Ginali ordered the construction of a second temple to Bane within the city that would cleave to orthodox teachings.\nBy 1367 DR, Ginali was missing, presumed dead.\nDescribed in one source as appearing like a \"pot-bellied spider at the center of its web\" and an \"epitome of evil\", all of Ginalis overtures of reunification were rejected."
