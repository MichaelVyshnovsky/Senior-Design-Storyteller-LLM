        "mainbody": "'''Ginali''' was a servant of the [[High Imperceptor of Bane|High Imperceptor]] of [[Bane]], known himself as the High Inquisitor of Bane, and an orthodox [[Church of Bane|Banite]].",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], he was charged with conducting an investigation into the fitness of [[Fzoul Chembryl]] to be head of the church in the West [[Moonsea]] region. Once it was clear that Fzoul would not rejoin the orthodox church, in an effort to persuade his followers to abandon him. Ginali and his followers briefly took over the [[Black Altar]], while Fzoul was distracted by the attempted capture of [[Shandril Shessair]], but was evicted when Fzoul refocused on the goings-on in the Keep. In response, Ginali ordered the construction of a second temple to Bane within the city that would cleave to orthodox teachings.\n\nBy [[1367 DR]], Ginali was missing, presumed dead.<ref>",
        "Personality": "Described in one source as appearing like a \"pot-bellied spider at the center of its web\" and an \"epitome of evil\",<ref> all of Ginali's overtures of reunification were rejected."
