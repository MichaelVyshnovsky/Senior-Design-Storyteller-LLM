'''Deriel Rethslane''' was a [[moon elf]] scout living in [[Cormanthor]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|11}}

==History==
Deriel lived in the woods of Cormanthor for a century until she met the [[drow]] merchant [[Arrizz]] and the two fell in love.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], however, Arrizz was captured by the [[Red Plumes]] and destined to go to the [[Hillsfar Arena]]. Deriel negotiated an exchange for him: she would deliver to them worthy fighters and they would release Arrizz.

She saw an adventuring party asking about the [[Tinfellow]] family and decided they would be a good choice. So she tried to lure them into an ambush of the Red Plumes.{{Cite adventurers league/Shackles of Blood|17-18}}

==Personality==
Deriel had the habit of chewing on her thumbnail when listening to others speaking. She had little patience for debate or contemplation. Deriel's main goal was protecting the harmony of nature, and defending elven people.
