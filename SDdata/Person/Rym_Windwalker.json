        "mainbody": "Rym Windwalker was a half-elven wizard living in Halruaa in 1367 DR.\nEager to prove himself as a young mage, Rym always looked for adventure. He was known to join wandering bands of adventurers.\nRyms adventurous spirit threatened to be his undoing, as he was more likely to charge into battle before weighing the consequences of such actions."
