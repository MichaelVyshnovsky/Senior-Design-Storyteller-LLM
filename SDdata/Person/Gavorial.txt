'''Gavorial''' was a [[stone giant]] serving as a member of the [[Giant Guard]] of [[Hartsvale]].

==Description==
Gavorial was bald.

==Activities==
As a member of the Giant Guard, Gavorial served as a sort of ambassador between the [[human]]s of Hartsvale and the stone giants. His duty was to defend King [[Camden]], and his post was [[Earls Bridge]].

==History==
In [[1366 DR]], when Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] returned to Castle Hartwick after her abduction, Gavorial attempted to arrest her and bring her to the [[Twilight Spirit]]; however, [[Tavis Burdun]] aimed an arrow at Brianna and threatened to kill her rather than allow Gavorial to take her. Since Gavorial knew that the Twilight Spirit had no use for a dead princess, he instead departed.
