Gavorial was a stone giant serving as a member of the Giant Guard of Hartsvale.
Gavorial was bald.
As a member of the Giant Guard, Gavorial served as a sort of ambassador between the humans of Hartsvale and the stone giants. His duty was to defend King Camden, and his post was Earls Bridge.
In 1366 DR, when Princess Brianna returned to Castle Hartwick after her abduction, Gavorial attempted to arrest her and bring her to the Twilight Spirit however, Tavis Burdun aimed an arrow at Brianna and threatened to kill her rather than allow Gavorial to take her. Since Gavorial knew that the Twilight Spirit had no use for a dead princess, he instead departed.
