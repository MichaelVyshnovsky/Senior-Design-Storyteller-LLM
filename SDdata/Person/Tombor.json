        "mainbody": "Tombor the Jolly was a cleric of the Maces of Elversult,\nWhile he was a portly man, Tombor was surprisingly light on his feet.\nTombor earned his nickname from his ever-present merry demeanor, that he said was a gift from his patron deity.\nThe good-humored priest was an adept healer, and could make a salve that would alleviate the pain and lessen damage caused to the body.\nTombor the holy symbol of Mask around his neck, and carried the eponymous bludgeoning weapon after which his order of soldiers was named.\nAs an operative for the Dragon Coast cell of the Dragon Cult, Tombor formed a working relationship with Wei Dao, Princess of Shou Lung and wife of Prince Kao Chou Tang of the Ginger Palace.\nIn the , Tombor accompanied the Lady Constable as she worked with the sorceress Ruha to free Yanseldara from the clutches of Cypress the Black, while at the same time sabotaging their efforts to appease the undead dragon.\nTombor accompanied Vaerana as the Maces intercepted Ruha at Pros, then traveled with the Bedine witch to Elversult and down the Snake Road to the Shou embassy of the Ginger Palace, so that she could learn more information about Yanseldaras whereabouts. He gave her a chest of gold coins from Sembia, topped with a unique coin from Calimshan, telling Ruha it would help grant her an audience with Princess Wei Dao. In truth the coin was hollowed out, and held a deceitful message informing the princess that Ruha was an assassin sent to slay Prince Tang.\nBecause of Tombors message, Ruhas negotiations failed and due to Wei Daos mistrust, she was taken captive. In order to gain the upper hand, Tombor, Vaerana, and the rest of the Maces intercepted the Shou caravan carrying Minister Hsieh Han Liu, and took him hostage. Exchanging the minister for their own agent, Vaerana and Maces all but ruined their chances for peaceful negotiation with the Shou ministry. Despite this turn of events, Ruha managed to convince the Shou to work with the people of Elversult and even uncovered Tombors treacherous actions fortunately for him, she could not reveal the information until she could speak to someone away from his presence.\nTaking advantage of Ruhas exhaustion, Tombor acted quickly to secure a batch of pressed ylang blossoms, the critical piece of his masters plan to claim Yanseldaras spirit as his own. He killed the half-orc ship captain Fowler and Silavia the cook of Moonstorm House, and took the pressed blossoms to Cypress lair in the caverns within the nameless swamp, not knowing they were purposefully harvested incorrectly, and left for the cleric to recover. After inadvertently offering Cypress a useless cask of ylang oil, Cypress forced Tombor to fill his pockets with gold from the dracolichs treasure horde and walk straight into a subterranean lake."
