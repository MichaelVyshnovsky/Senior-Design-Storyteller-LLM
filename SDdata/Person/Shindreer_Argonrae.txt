Shindreer Argonrae was a drow priestess of Lolth and an ally of House Auvryndar in the Troglodyte Warrens in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
House Argonrae was a vassal ally of House Auvryndar and Shindreer acted as commander of the combined forces. However, in 1492 DR, Vlonwelv Auvryndar feared Shindreers ambition and sent her to battle House Freths army in the Troglodyte Warrens, hoping for her death but Shindreer proved harder to kill. She was supported by a summoned hezrou in the middle of the ferocious battle with Freth troops. If nobody intervened, Shindreer won the day.
Shindreer was a powerful member of her house and fiercely hated Vlonwelv Auvryndar, hoping to depose her and gain supremacy for House Argonrae.
