Zaravron was originally a trader in textiles but he greatly expanded the business into a large merchant house that had caravan routes throughout the [[Dalelands]] and the [[Moonsea]] region in [[north Faerûn]]. Despite the great influence of the [[Zhentarim]] in the same geographical and economic regions, Zaravron managed to keep the Shield Trading Company independent and unaffiliated with that organization.\n\nIn his later years, Zaravron became somewhat of a recluse and was seldom seen in public.",
