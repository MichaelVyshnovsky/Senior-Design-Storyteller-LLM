'''Chanoch''' was a young [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] warrior from [[Ikemmu]].

==History==
Chanoch was born into a small Shadar-kai enclave.  His mother was murdered by a childless Shadar-kai who wanted Chanoch as her son.  He escaped into the [[Shadowfell]] as soon as he could and was found by a patrol from Ikemmu.  He was mentored by a priest of [[Tempus]] and was expected to one day take vows as a priest of Tempus. 

In [[1479 DR]], Chanoch was selected to accompany [[Vedoran]] and [[Ashok]] on a mission to rescue the [[wizard|witch]] [[Ilvani]] from from an enclave in the Shadowfell.  While inside the enclave, Chanoch argued with Vedoran and, upon their return to Ikemmu, Vedoran accused Chanoch of insubordination, a capital offense in Ikemmu.  [[Uwan]], the leader of Ikemmu, sentenced Chanoch to confinement until his soul faded.
