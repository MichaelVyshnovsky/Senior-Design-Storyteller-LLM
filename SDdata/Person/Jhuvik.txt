Jhuvik, usually known as Jhuvik of the Seven Gems, was an elven thief and cleric of Mystra in Milvarune, and a senior member of the Moonstars in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Jhuvik venerated Khelben Arunsun and Laeral Silverhand for their status as Chosen of Mystra but he rarely spoke about this. His personal thiefs code was to steal magic items and knowledge from people that abused the Art and give it to Mystras faithful.
Jhuvik lived in Milvarune, Thesk. His main exploit, from which he received his nickname, was stealing seven large gems from the headdress of a Thayan zulkir while it was still being worn.
At one point Jhuvik was recruited into the Moonstars.
