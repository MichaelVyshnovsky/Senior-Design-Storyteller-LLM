        "mainbody": "Lady Constable '''Vaerana Hawklyn''' was a [[human]] [[ranger]], a former adventurer, and the head of law enforcement for the city of [[Elversult]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the consort of the city's ruler, Lady Lord [[Yanseldara]].",
        "History": "Vaerana and Yanseldara were originally adventuring companions.\n\nSome time in the mid-1300s DR, Yanseldara skillfully led a popular uprising against the [[necromancy|necromantic]] regime that had oppressed Elversult for centuries. They deposed the old order and took power themselves, with Yanseldara ruling the city and Vaerana standing beside her overseeing law enforcement.\n\nHowever, the old crime and corruption that had once infested the city went underground, so the two now worked to combat and quash it, as they did through the late 1350s, 1360s DR, and early 1370s DR.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil|Cypress the Black]] used his [[psionic]] powers to contact Yanseldara, and then [[poison]]ed her body and kidnapped her spirit, all in an obsessive \"love\" for her after she destroyed his mortal body. While Vaerana lent her strength to Yanseldara's spirit, the [[Bedine]] Harper witch [[Ruha]] and the [[Shou]] prince [[Kao Chou Tang|Tang]] rescued Yanseldara's spirit and slew the dracolich. The two were reunited afterward.<ref>\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Vaerana was officially Yanseldara's consort.",
        "Activities": "As Lady Constable, Vaerana oversaw law enforcement in Elversult and in this capacity aided Yanseldara in its governance. She used a variety of agents and spies to monitor affairs in the city. She had her agents and fellow Harpers infiltrating a local petty [[thieves' guild]] called the [[Purple Masks]] around [[1358 DR]], with the aim of disbanding it or else subverting it into a covert arm of the government.",
        "Relationships": "Vaerana was the consort of Yanseldara, and her trusted confidant and strong right arm in the governing of the city. Once companions in adventure, they became best friends and lovers.\n\nVaerana was an active agent of the [[Harpers]].",
        "Home": "Vaerana and Yanseldara lived together in [[Moonstorm House]], nicknamed the \"Ladytowers\" by the Elversians. This mansion of slender towers stood on Moonstorm Lane, on the eastern side of the westernmost hill in Elversult, in the so-called \"Ladytowers' Lands\".",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that Vaerana was a friend or ally of the Harpers, or even a Harper herself. This was of course quite correct."
