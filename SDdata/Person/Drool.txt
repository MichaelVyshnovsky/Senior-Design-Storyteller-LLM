Drool was an ogre at the Sacred Stone Monastery during the Elemental Evil crisis in 1491 DR.
Drool acted as a subterranean guard and jailer of the monastery, under the orders of Jurth.
Drool was a simpleton, not really understanding what was going on. He believed he could make jurth happy by torturing the prisoners.
Some adventurers infiltrated the monastery and in the end confronted and defeated Drool, Jurth, and his minions.
