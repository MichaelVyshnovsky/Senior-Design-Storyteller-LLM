        "Description": "Gaslo was noticeably more grim than his fellow farmers. He was an older [[human]] with deeply furrowed worried face.",
        "History": "In 1372 DR, farmer Gaslo traveled to Daggerford along with his fellows [[Rorry]] and [[Hevesar Dimpet]] to seek help with the mysterious disappearances of the cattle from [[Wild Pastures]]. The farmers stayed in the city during Daggerford's lockdown and eventually found help for Liam's Hold. The group of adventurers, who later became heroes of Daggerford, agreed to investigate the bizarre disappearances."
