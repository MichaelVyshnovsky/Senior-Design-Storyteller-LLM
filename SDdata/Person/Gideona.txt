Lochlord '''Gideona''' was the leader of the [[Keepers]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Gideona's ambition was that, within the next decade, all overland routes and gates along the [[River Sargauth]] would fall under the Keepers' control, permitting her to control all trade in and around the city.
