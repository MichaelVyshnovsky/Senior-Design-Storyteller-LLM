'''Gugak Thul''' was the [[hobgoblin]] chief of a small tribe around [[1369 DR]], who was subservient to the [[fire giant]] [[Oghalis]] as they operated in the [[Hullack Forest]].

==Personality==
Gugak was rather upset and short-tempered about the state of his tribe and its new direction under Oghalis.

==Possessions==
Gugak wielded a ''+2 [[longsword]]'' and a [[spear]], and carried a ''[[potion of healing]]. He had a significant stash of [[gems]] and coins.

==Activities==
Under Oghalis' direction, he managed much of the tribe's internal matters and oversaw the production of [[copper]] and lumber at their work camp.

==Relationships==
He wasn't particularly fond of Oghalis, but was willing to work for her if it meant benefiting his tribe. He sought spiritual advice and wisdom from his [[shaman]] [[Hakaakatar]] the Wise.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gugak's tribe suffered many losses as they attempted to live in the [[Hullack Forest]]. Hoping to improve their fortunes, he accepted the leadership of the fire giant [[Oghalis]], who had the tribe turn to aggressive woodcutting and exploratory copper mining. To expedite this, they began enslaving the local [[satyr]]s and [[centaur]]s, but they proved unsuitable for copper smelting. The tribe then began kidnapping [[human]]s from the nearby town of [[Thunderstone]], forcing their satyrs to abduct [[Troyappa]], [[Kenhart]], [[Joelem]], and [[Jonren]]. This finally drew the attention of [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers, who raided the camp and freed the slaves.
