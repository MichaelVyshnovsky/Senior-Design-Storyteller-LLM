Estann Rabruin was an entrepreneurial human man who founded the community of Rabruins Tor near the Hullack Forest.
Estann was a forceful, unscrupulous and energetic man who pursued his goals with ruthless ambition.
Estann was a successful and wealthy woodcutter and wainwright.
Estann had five sons who lived with him on the Tor and after his death, who were generally timid and passive compared to him. His eldest, Torstryn Rabruin, was perhaps the most assertive and proactive.
In the 1330s DR, Estann bought and developed a plot of land atop a crag next to the East Way near the Hullack Forest, naming it Rabruins Tor. At the same time he sponsored a project to cut a new road, the Hullackheart Trail, from the Stags Skull Bridge at Thunderstone to his new home at the Tor. But King Rhigaerd Obarskyr II, not wanting Estanns woodcutting to disturb potential threats in the forest and the long-term effects of his new settlement growing further, banned woodcutting within a half-day of the Bridge, effectively ending Estanns ambitions before they could be realized.
After Estann died sometime, his sons continued to live and work on the Tor with their own families as of the late 14 century DR.
