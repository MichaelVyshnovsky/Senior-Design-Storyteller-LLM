'''Aziz-Tagem''' was a crime lord on the isle of [[Bawa]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Aziz-Tagem, a man of mixed [[Bavanese]] and [[Bawani]] ancestry, ruled over the still small yakuza of Bawa. He was a master organizer and a very prudent leader, hoping to expand his network without interference from the authorities. He usually directed the bold yakuza to explore the wilderness.
