He tried to advance his position by joining the Council of Spiders. However he was careless and was nearly executed for his ambition. Exiled from Menzoberranzan, he was taken in by Vizeran, who played the role of the shadowy patron of the council.\nGrin supported his masters plots, hoping to find a way to reclaim his city from the matron mothers tyranny.\nHowever, during the execution of the plan to send back the demon lords, Grin revealed that his master wanted to destroy Menzoberranzan in the process, and tried to convince a group of adventurers to change the location of the banishing ritual.\nGrin was loyal to his master but disliked such a solitary existence. For a long time, he had waited for a chance to return to his city, supporting the idea of a male uprising. Grin would not agree with his master if he found Menzoberranzan was to become a battleground for demon lords."
