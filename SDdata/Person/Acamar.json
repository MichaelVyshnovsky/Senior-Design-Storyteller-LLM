        "mainbody": "Acamar was a star-like entity from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace. Unlike normal stars, Acamar didnt have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.\nAcamar was a dead star of utterly black inky nothingness that ate other celestial bodies that drew too close to it.\nAcamar and the other Far Realmâ€“infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the Eldest.\nAcamars hunger was endless, and when its influence on Toril was at its peak, it sent its agents, the Maws of Acamar, to devour everything they encountered in their path to sate the hunger of the dead star.\nAcamar was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it.\nAcamar was one of the stars the warlock Japheth Donard sought out in 1396 DR, after losing his pact with the archfey Neifion.\nIn 1492 DR, Acamar, posing as an imaginary lover, taunted Skrianna Shadowdusk."
