==Description==
He was slim and graceful and quite the playboy.<ref name=EotSS-p165"/>

==Activities==
Dal dreamed of a Tulmon fully independent from the influences of [[Calimshan]], [[Suldolphor]], and others. He was an up and coming leader among Tulmon's younger generation, and many within the city viewed his ideas as dangerous.<ref name=EotSS-p165"/>
