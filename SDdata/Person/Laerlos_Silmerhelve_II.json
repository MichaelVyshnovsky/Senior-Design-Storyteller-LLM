        "mainbody": "Lord Laerlos Silmerhelve II was one of the Moonlight Men, companions of famed bard Mintiper Moonsilver, who fell in the Battle of Turnstone Pass against a horde of orcs. Laerlos bravery was immortalized in the ballad Moonlight Paean, which was included in Mintipers Chapbook.\nLaerlos was proud and rebellious against his parents.\nAt the time of his death, Laerlos was in possession of several of his familys heirlooms, the griffonlance of goring, Nimoars blazing bulwark, and the silverhelm of the Guardian, which was a relic of the god Helm.\nLaerlos was the only son of Lord Laerlos Silmerhelve I and his wife Lady Tannyth. They were of House Silmerhelve of Waterdeep.\nAgainst his familys wishes, Laerlos II left Waterdeep to join the Moonlight Men. He was slain in the , but he was one of the most notable members of the Men mentioned in the Paean.\nThe three family relics of the Silmerhelve family were thought to still lie in the Cairn of Moonlight, a secret barrow where the fallen from the battle were said to have been buried along with their treasures."
