He mentioned that he stole the rope from Jarlaxle, and replaced it with a fake one. He told the ward that with it, the group would be immune to [[Deirex]]'s power, and could loot his mage tower.\n\nHe could be found in the headquarters of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], and was a lieutenant to his commander, Jarlaxle."
