Lord Eles Wianar was the ruler of Chondath in the late 14 century DR.
He was very protective of his treasury, and had spies in the powerful noble houses in nearby cities of Sespech and Arrabar. He confronted and defeated every assassin sent to kill him.
Lord Wianar attacked Elbulder by land and Mimph by sea. Both attacks were attempts at reconnaissance, and he planned a larger invasion of Elbulder along the Old Road with a simultaneous naval attack on Mimph.
