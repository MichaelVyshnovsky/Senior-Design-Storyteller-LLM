Troyappa was a young man of Thunderstone who was kidnapped along with Kenhart, Joelem, and Jonren to work as a slave in the fire giant Oghalis smelting operation in the Hullack Forest. He and the rest were kidnapped by a satyr who was forced to kidnap else have his own family killed.
Fortunately, not that long after disappearing from the town, concerned adventurers raided the operation, freeing the young men along with many enslaved centaurs and satyrs.
