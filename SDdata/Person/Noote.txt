Chief '''Noote''' was the grand ruler of all the [[hill giant]] tribes throughout the [[Ice Spires]] in [[1366 DR]].{{Giantcraft date}}

==Personality==
Being excluded from a conversation often upset Noote.

==Relationships==
Chief Noote considered King [[Camden]] to be one of his most respected friends. Camden's daughter [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] considered him to be very kind and a trustworthy ally.

==History==
Around 1366 DR, Chief Noote developed friendly relations with the royal family of [[Hartsvale]]. As a result, the kingdom's long standing feuding with the hill giant tribes of the Spires came to an end. During that year he would make many visits to [[Castle Hartwick]].

Sometime after winter, Noote came to Castle Hartwick on the day of Brianna's birthday and brought within a satchel a present for her in the form of a half-frozen [[snow leopard]] that he had killed. He expressed some confusion at King Camden's suggestion that the carcass needed "prepared," but shrugged it off and suggested they don't lose the beast's claws, noting that they could make a good [[collar (animal)|collar]] for a [[wolf]].
