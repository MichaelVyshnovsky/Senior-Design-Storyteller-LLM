        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, as the [[iron crisis]] threatened the Sword Coast, Laurel traveled coastal areas to the west of the town of [[Nashkel]]. There, Laurel stood against a [[gibberling]] infestation, seeking to end their threat. She spent two weeks nightly slaughtering waves of the attaching creatures. Her devotion to the code of law and goodly morals led Laurel to attack any evildoer or criminal that came across her path."
