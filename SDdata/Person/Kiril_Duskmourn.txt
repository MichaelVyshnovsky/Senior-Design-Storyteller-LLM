'''Kiril Duskmourn''' was a [[star elf]] warrior and a [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]]. She was involved in the sealing of [[Pandorym]] in {{yearlink|1374}}, the unmasking of [[Telarian]] in {{yearlink|1375}}, and left for [[Abeir]] after the [[Spellplague]].

==Personality==
The star elf was known for her foul mouth, purposeful baiting of others, and derision.

She carried an endless shame from her time in Stardeep,{{cite book/Darkvision|31-34}} and was uncomfortable with people.{{cite book/Darkvision|29-30}}

==Possessions==
Kiril was the wielder of the sword [[Angul]]. She also carried a magical [[bronze]] flask of endless whiskey and wore [[elven chainmail]]. She also was gifted the sword ''[[Sadrul]]''.

==History==
===Early Life and Stardeep===
Kiril was a warden of [[Stardeep]] for five years, up until a decade before 1375 DR, together with her childhood beloved and fiancee, [[Nangulis]]. When [[Carnis|The Traitor]] breached containment, the two of them, together with [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]] employed ancient lore from the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] to fashion a magical sword, ''[[Angul]]'', from the soul of [[Nangulis]]. So armed, Kiril managed to contain the Traitor again.{{cite book/Stardeep|65}} However, the intense ego of the weapon was nearly impossible for her to bear: she came to slay several young [[wood elves]] for being too curious about the monoliths in the entrance of Stardeep. It made her go insane.{{cite book/Stardeep|69-72}}

She fled to for the lonely mesas southeast, trapping dune rats, drinking excessively, and occassionally finding bodyguard work. After working for a man who looked like he was ninety years of age,{{cite book/Darkvision|130-131|14}} she became the regular bodyguard of the [[dwarf]] [[geomancer]] [[Thormud Horn]].{{cite book/Darkvision|109}} While with him, she christened the mesa that the dwarf inhabited [[the Finger Defiant]], and visited at least one volcano,{{cite book/Stardeep|257}}

===Sealing of Pandorym===
While under Thormud's service, Kiril helped investigate a disturbance, which led her south of the Finger Defiant for the first time since she was in his employ, expecting to head all the way to [[Durpar]].{{cite book/Darkvision|31-34}} Along the path, she was forced to resort to ''Angul'' after a phantom attacked Thormud during a divination;{{cite book/Darkvision|75-76}} the dwarf determined the disturbance led to [[Adama's Tooth]] and she recovered a fragment of [[plangent crystal]] from the monster after dispatching it.{{cite book/Darkvision|81-82}}

Close to [[Sezilinta]],{{cite book/Darkvision|131|14}} and within reach of Adama's Tooth, they stopped for Thormud to summon a champion; he called upon [[Prince Monolith]] just in time for a new [[demon]] to attack them.{{cite book/Darkvision|133-138}} The summoned elemental agreed to stay with them if they turned instead north, where it claimed the true source of the corruption was; they agreed, but Thormud turned out to harbor an affliction after the fight.{{cite book/Darkvision|141-143}}

They crossed a pass between the [[Giant's Belt]] and the [[Dustwall]] to arrive at the [[Raurin]];{{cite book/Darkvision|176-179}} seeking shelter from a coming storm, they made a brief stop in a cave, where they found the [[elf]] enclave of [[Al Qahara]].{{cite book/Darkvision|181-184}} There, she learned of the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]] to the north, which the elves had dubbed the Storm Spike; she also learned of the curse on that place, and received the sword ''[[Sadrul]]'', which a local elf hoped would avenge its previous wielder, dead from a curse in the returned Palace.{{cite book/Darkvision|207-211}}

She entered the Palace later together with Prince Monolith, and the geomancer's familiar, [[Xet]].{{cite book/Darkvision|229-231}} She encountered two missing elves, presumably from [[Al Qahara]], controlled by the same crystal that Thormud had encountered,{{cite book/Darkvision|260-261}}  then she was forced to use ''Angul'' again in order to defeat a [[water elemental]].{{cite book/Darkvision|264-265}} They eventually came across [[Ususi Manaallin]], [[Iahn Qoyllor]], [[Warian Datharathi|Warian]] and [[Zeltaebar Datharathi]], who where in a trap. After rescuing them, they joined forces.{{cite book/Darkvision|274-277}} Afterwards, they entered the [[Imperial Weapons Cache]] and fought [[Pandorym]]'s forces.{{cite book/Darkvision|288-306}}

Zeltaebar Datharathi briefly proposed her some trade with Stardeep, but she wasn't interested.{{cite book/Darkvision|308-309}}

===Telarian Incident===
After resealing Pandorym, Kiril had decided to head back for Stardeep. Thormud gave her Xet as a gift; unfortunaely, her resolve wavered in [[Laothkund]], and she postponed the last leg of her trip for months.{{cite book/Stardeep|109-110}} At some point after [[Midwinter]] of {{yearlink|1375}},{{cite book/Stardeep|1}} Kiril was in a bad way after ''[[Angul]]'' was stolen; it was soon returned to her after the thief, [[Gage]], stole it back from the [[Shadow Tongue]] thieves of Laothkund. Gage told her that the item had been stolen on behalf of Nangulis; in response to that name, she revealed her past, and decided to revisit Stardeep to see if there were any actual news from Nangulis.{{cite book/Stardeep|56-73}}

They were attacked along the way by the necromancer [[Sathra]], whom Gage had claimed he'd slain during the theft; Kiril used ''Angul'' to slay her.{{cite book/Stardeep|120}} When she arrived at the [[Causeway]] of Stardeep, she and Gage discovered elven corpses resulting from a pitched battle; defenders from Stardeep afterwards demanded her sword in return for allowing her to enter. She refused; before the defenders could insist, Gage revealed it was a trap in which he was involved. Though ''Angul'' refused to aid her in the fight against the [[Empyrean Knights]] of Stardeep, the sudden arrival of [[Raidon Kane]] and [[Adrik Commorant]] allowed them to prevail.{{cite book/Stardeep|143-149}} She joined forces with the strangers, but violently refused Gage's further company past that point.{{cite book/Stardeep|170-180}}

She led Raidon and Adrik into [[Sildëyuir]].{{cite book/Stardeep|195}} They soon found [[Moonveil Citadel]] under attack from [[nilshai]]; one of them revealed that they were operating on behalf of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]].{{cite book/Stardeep|215-219}} Then they sought out the Edgewarden, who opened a passage for them to the [[Underdungeon]] beneath Stardeep.{{cite book/Stardeep|224-228}} Shortly after Adrik's death, she caught up with the Keeper [[Telarian]], who claimed that Delphe had been the one to use Nangulis' name when seeking her sword.{{cite book/Stardeep|265-267}}

Kiril accompanied Telarian, intent on stopping Delphe from releasing the Traitor; along the way, they were slowed down by several of [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]]'s bodies, which Telarian dispatched violently and without a fight with a powerful spell.{{cite book/Stardeep|273-274}} She asked Raidon to use his [[Cerulean Sign]] to teleport them into the chamber with [[Delphe]]; at the last moment, Telarian revealed himself to be the actual traitor, striking at her with ''[[Nis]]'.{{cite book/Stardeep|279-282}}

The contact between ''Angul'' and ''Nis'' caused the blades to merge into ''[[Nis|Angul-Nis]]''; rejoined, Nangulis' spirit contacted Kiril.{{cite book/Stardeep|287-291}} Though theirs was a bitter parting, she eventually accepted that he had to sunder his spirit in two again in order to prevent the Traitor from escaping his prison.{{cite book/Stardeep|296-298}}

She turned out to be incapable of letting go of Nangulis afterwards, and grabbed ''Angul'' again before his soul could depart for the afterlife.{{cite book/Stardeep|310-311}}

===Spellplague===
Shortly after [[1385 DR]], Kiril entered the [[Vilhon Wilds]] and disappeared. According to the [[Chalk Destrier]], Kiril, Thormud and a [[dragonet]] named [[Xet]] went to some place known as ''"[[Laerakond|Returned Abeir]]"'' at some point before [[1396 DR]]. She gave her sword, Angul, to the Chalk Destrier in exchange for a portal to Returned Abeir.
