'''Angarn Surfyst''' was a bandit and the one-time ruler of the [[Keep of the Far Hills]].

==History==
Some time before the early 12{{th}} century [[DR]], Angarn betrayed the then-current lord of Keep of the Far Hills, [[Othlong Blackhelm]]. Angarn then took the keep as his own, using it as a base for bandit raids against others.

At some point, Angarn himself was himself killed by one of his own followers, an inidivudal known only as the [[Wolf Knight]].
