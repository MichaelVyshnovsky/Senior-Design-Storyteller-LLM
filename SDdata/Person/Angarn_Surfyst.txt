Angarn Surfyst was a bandit and the one-time ruler of the Keep of the Far Hills.
Some time before the early 12 century DR, Angarn betrayed the then-current lord of Keep of the Far Hills, Othlong Blackhelm. Angarn then took the keep as his own, using it as a base for bandit raids against others.
At some point, Angarn himself was himself killed by one of his own followers, an inidivudal known only as the Wolf Knight.
