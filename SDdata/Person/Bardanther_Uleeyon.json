        "mainbody": "Bardanther Uleeyon was a member of the War Wizards of Cormyr in the early 13 century DR. He was a former warrior that discovered he had an aptitude for the Art in his later years.\nBardanther was of short stature and his face and skin showed the years of exposure to the elements. He favored plain, functional clothing.\nHe had the habit of always keeping a dagger concealed on his person wherever he went. Bardanther repeatedly affirmed his loyalty to Cormyr, the Crown, and the rule of law when secretly tested by his superior. Presented with opportunities to gain wealth, power, or forbidden pleasures, he demonstrated a strong moral fiber.\nHe was an experienced veteran who had both armed combat experience and a gift for magic. As such, he was a valuable asset to the Crown and became a \"special agent\" who often handled unusual situations with finesse.\nAt the time of his disappearance, Bardanther was wearing a Purple Dragon ring which allowed him past certain wards in the Palace, among its other abilities. During this era of Cormyr history, these rings were not traceable by the War Wizards, so its loss was somewhat concerning.\nBardanther took it upon himself to guide some of the younger wizards that were still novices. He did this partially to assess their suitability and capabilities for advancement.\nBardanther was the senior war wizard on the mission to escort a pay-wagon that was carrying about 60,000 silver pieces for the Purple Dragons in the . The commander of the mission, Thandor Waevor, had fallen extremely ill for unknown reasons and entrusted Bardanther and the others to go ahead without him. Somewhere on the roads north of Marsember (at that time, it was considered eastern Cormyr) the carriage was hijacked by forces unknown. Bardanther and the other guards were ever seen again. The vehicle itself, eventually known to history as Waevors Wagon, surprised a group of nobles on an escort mission to Immersea that were camped on the road. The wagon struck and killed Tharim Roaringhorn and Elbryn Scatterstars on its mad dash through the night."
