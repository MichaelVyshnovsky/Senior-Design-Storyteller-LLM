        "mainbody": "Mhair Gulzrabban was the founder and leader of the adventuring band known as the Company of the Cloak.\nMhair was a stout small man with tiny dark eyes.\nThe wizard was always in control, seeking power above all else and wanting to do as he pleased. He was always on the lookout for new ways to exploit a weakness or two in order to gain a profit.\nMhair, along with all of the other members of the Company of the Cloak, possessed an immunity to oil of taggit (which causes unconsciousness).\nSharaera Duthtue was Mhairs lover and apprentice. He was prepared for her eventual turn on him. Over the years, Gulzrabban made contacts with the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards of Thay, and the Shadow Thieves and set his organization up as \"adventurer killers\".\nGulzrabban began the Company of the Cloak in 1357 DR in the city of Scornubel within the Western Heartlands. Recruiting cutthroats and brigands, Mhair assembled a band to hunt down buried treasure and forgotten lore. \nAs time passed, he faced mutiny and dissatisfaction within his company until deciding to stalk fellow adventurers.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryCalishites\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Scornubel\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryMembers of the Company of the Cloak\npz4gnczilzsvvhypnujpwj3h8jgl45f"
