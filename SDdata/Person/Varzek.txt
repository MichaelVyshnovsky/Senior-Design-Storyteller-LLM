Varzek was a cleric of Vhaeraun in Cormanthor in 1373 DR.
Around 1372 DR, Varzek, Chall, and six other warriors settled in Cormanthor.
In 1373 DR, Varzeks team went to explore the ruined tower of Talarith near the Moonsea area. However, the towers wards repelled drow so they were forced to search for additional allies in order to enter the tower.
