'''Aeso''' was a junior [[Church of Sel没ne|Sel没nite]] priest at [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the year [[1373 DR]], Aeso served at Moonshadow Hall under High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]] and Moonmistress-Designate [[Feena Archwood]]. After Feena infected Dhauna with [[lycanthropy]] and fled Yhaunn, Aeso joined a party of Sel没nites who pursued her, along with the senior priests [[Mifano]] and [[Velsinore]]. Led on a false trail by fellow priestess [[Julith Harkspur]] and the renegade [[Church of Shar|Sharran]] [[Keph Thingoleir]], the Sel没nite party captured the rogue pair instead. Upon realizing that they had found a Sharran agent, Aeso was overcome with loathing and struck Keph in the face with his elbow, with Mifano admonishing him for it.
