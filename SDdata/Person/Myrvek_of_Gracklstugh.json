        "mainbody": "'''Myrvek of Gracklstugh''' was a [[derro]] merchant and savant who lived in the [[Underdark]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was of the [[Hakrett]] clan.",
        "Personality": "The derro savant sold wares in the area near [[Rilauven]], such as magical gear. He was also in the possession of some rare [[gem]]s, but did not sell these. Myrvek had an odd personality, and may become hostile if insulted.\n\nDespite their racial differences, he took up the company of fellow merchants [[Heggr Splitsteel]] and [[Wode the Guileful]].\n\nMyrvek would fight his enemies with his [[quarterstaff]] and magical [[spells]]."
