{{Quote|It's our sister – Mayrina. She is...well, she was in a bad way after her husband died...Next thing, she's gone looking for the [[hag]]. Of all the ''stupid'' things to do.|Demir}}

==Personality==
He was the most level-headed and cautious person among himself and his siblings.

==Relationships==
Demir had a brother named [[Johl]] and a sister called [[Mayrina]].

==History==
Demir's family was struck with tragedy in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when Mayrina's husband [[Connor Vinderblad|Connor]] died rather suddenly. Bearing Connor's unborn child and devastated after her loss, Mayrina left for the [[Sunlit Wetlands]] to make a bargain with the [[green hag|old hag]] that lived in a [[Riverside Teahouse|shack]] within.

Demir and Johl went after their missing sister and managed to confront the old woman of the swamp [[Ethel]], before she made it back to Mayrina who was waiting within her home.
