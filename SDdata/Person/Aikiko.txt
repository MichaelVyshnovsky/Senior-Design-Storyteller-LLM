'''Aikiko''' was a senator of [[Innarlith]]. She was among the senators allied with the clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]]. She was executed by Ransar [[Pristoleph]] in [[1374 DR]] after the failed attempt by the senate faction to remove Pristoleph from power. 

==Description==
She was pretty with delicate features that looked [[elf|elven]] but she was in fact entirely [[human]], as her father was from Innarlith and her mother was [[Kozakuran]].

==Personality==
She was considered a simpleton and not very intelligent.

==Relationships==
Her father had been an Innarlan senator who had been killed by a rival in the 1350s DR. She herself later became a senator in Innarlith.

==History==
She attended some of the meetings hosted by the clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]] as he was trying to influence the [[Senate of Innarlith]], although he found her very irritating. In [[1367 DR]], he took her on the Ransar's yacht along with [[Willem Korvan]] to talk about his plans for the project to build the canal that would connect the [[Lake of Steam]] to the [[Nagaflow]]. He didn't bring her there because he thought she was useful, but because he wanted to find a way to send her somewhere far away to get rid of her so she'd stop coming to his meetings.

She and [[Kurtsson]], a henchman of Marek, were responsible for installing a magic [[portal]] at Marek's orders on the canal. This was against the wishes of Ransar [[Pristoleph]], who discovered it upon his return to Innarlith from abroad in [[1374 DR]] and ordered it to be taken down. After an attempt was made to assassinate [[Ivar Devorast]], who Pristoleph had appointed to oversee the canal project, he ordered for Kurtsson and Aikiko to be arrested on charges of treason. Under pressure from Marek and the senate, he later recanted this and publicly agreed to let the canal be finished the way that Kurtsson and Aikiko desired. 

Ivar Devorast then used [[smokepowder]] to blow up the canal. Pristoleph placed Devorast under arrest but he didn't execute him. The senate, under Marek's influence, turned against Pristoleph and engaged in open warfare on the streets against him and his faction. Aikiko was part of the conspiracy of senators that led the senate faction with the hope of overthrowing Pristoleph. 

She openly supported, along with Senator [[Asheru]], for Marek to be appointed as the next Ransar of Innarlith. She later changed her position to supporting the abolition of the position of Ransar and giving all executive power to the senate. 

Aikiko was present in the senate chamber in the [[Chamber of Law and Civility]] when Pristoleph came to formally announce his resignation as Ransar. She left when he began diverging from the remarks both sides had agreed upon and so she wasn't killed when he began using his abilities as a [[fire genasi]] to burn the audience that had come to hear the speech. 

She was wounded by a spear thrown by a [[wemic]] mercenary employed by Pristoleph in the gardens outside the Chamber of Law and Civility a few months later and captured by Pristoleph's faction. 

She and her fellow conspirators were then taken to the [[Palace of Many Spires]] to be judged by Pristoleph. Pristoleph offered Aikiko a choice between going to her mother's homeland of [[Kozakura]] or death. Aikiko insulted Pristoleph in the trial and refused to answer his question, which led Pristoleph to order a death sentence for her.
