'''Morag'''  was a queen of the [[Old One]]s, a powerful and cruel reptilian race.

==Activities==
During her time away from the Realms, Morag desired to regain her power and turn the continent of [[Faerûn]] into a jungle as it once was and once again emerge as its ruler.

==History==
Tens of thousand years before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the continent of [[Faerûn]] was a jungle. When an ice age came over the land, the Old Ones were all but wiped out. In order to sustain themselves and keep safe from the climate shift, Morag and a handful of her subjects entered an alternate dimension via a magical device known as the ''[[Source Stone]]''.

Many years later during the 1{{st}} century [[DR]], the settlement that came to be known as [[Neverwinter]] was constructed over the area where the ''Source Stone'' lay.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Maugrim Korothir]] heard rumors regarding the ''Source Stone'', discovered the long-lost item, and used it to trigger its defense mechanism, the [[Wailing Death]] plague. Maugrim became infected and was near-death, but Morag used her power to heal the man and share with him her ambitions. Morag commanded Maugrim to spread the Wailing Death throughout the city of Neverwinter, as each death that occurred within the vicinity of the ''Source Stone'' helped grow her power.

Morag began to appear in the dreams of [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]], following the execution of her lover [[Fenthick Moss]]. The ancient one lured Aribeth with promises of exacting revenge against Neverwinter for Fenthick's death. Eventually Aribeth capitulated and agreed to lead a [[Luskan]] army in an attack on Neverwinter. Meanwhile, Morag directed Maugrim and his cult to seek out the four [[Words of Power]], artifacts linked to the Old Ones that could help Morag free herself from the ''Source Stone''.

Unfortunately for Morag, the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] recovered three of the Words before Maugrim, albeit not the most powerful one of the set. With the power from the single Word of Power and the lives claimed by the Wailing Death, Morag broke free from the ''Source Stone''. However the Hero killed Maugrim, recovered the fourth Word of Power and confronted Morag within her [[demiplane]]. Morag fought the Hero in a terrific fight but was eventually slain and the ''Source Stone's'' realm imploded upon itself.
