        "Behavior": "In his old age Artur was a rather lazy creature.",
        "History": "Artur spent most of his life as the [[animal companion]] to a [[druid]]. When his druid eventually died he was taken in by [[Marigold Mufflefoot]] and given a permanent home at Marigold's Menagerie, for he knew that simply letting the aged [[bear]] return to the wild would surely spell its death. Whenever Marigold could manage to get Artur outside to exercise, it always attracted a crowd."
