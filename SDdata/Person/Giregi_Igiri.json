        "mainbody": "iregi Igiri was a merchant who specialized in alchemical supplies and potions in Port Nyanzaru, Chult, during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was a difficult man to impress.\nGiregi was a very busy merchant who worked for the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru to facilitate the import and trade of alchemical reagents as well as finished potions, apothecary supplies, poisons, antidotes, and even certain foods and drinks.Given the scope of goods in this list, he likely represented the interests of the merchant princes Jessamine (for ingredients and poisons), Kwayoth√© (for food and drink), and Wakanga Otamu (for potions). He worked alongside the Master of the Market as a point of contact for foreign merchants who sold such goods and were seeking to establish a presence in Port Nyanzaru, and he could be found at the citys Bazaar.\nDuring the events of the death curse, Giregi helped to organize a seasonal symposium of Port Nyanzaru merchants and artisans in order to facilitate trade into the city."
