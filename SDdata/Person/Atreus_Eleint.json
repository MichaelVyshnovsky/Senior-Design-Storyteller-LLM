        "mainbody": "Atreus Eleint was a wealthy human noble and the descendant of an unknown noble family living in Erlkazar. A spell used on him in his youth had distorted his growth and caused him to become severely deformed, not detracting much from his physical abilities but ruining his appearance. This virtual handicap prevented him from living a normal life and caused him to become obsessed with trying to become handsome. Eventually, he joined the church of Sune, asking for a miracle, and was sent on an impossible quest to the Utter East to find the valley of Langdarma."
