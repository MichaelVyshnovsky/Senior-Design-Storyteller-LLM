'''Chaathuuladroth''' was a [[green dragon]] inhabiting the region of [[Okoth]] in the {{YearlinkName|681}}.

==Activities==
For unknown reasons, the young Chaathuuladroth destroyed [[Nezram's tower]] and looted it for treasure, killing or driving off most of the wizard's descendants; the powerful [[Nezram]] himself was not living in the tower at this time. Chaathuuladroth then carried off most of Nezram's treasures away somewhere to the west.<ref name=OE-p5>
