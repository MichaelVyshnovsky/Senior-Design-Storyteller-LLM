'''Princess Ebonmire''' was a sentient [[black pudding]] follower of the [[Pudding King]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At an unknown time, the black pudding devoured two [[spellbook]]s written by [[svirfneblin]] [[archmage]] [[Lesla Carrowil]].

The Pudding King, an insane [[deep gnome]] fascinated by [[ooze]]s, subjugated the black pudding, which he called Princess Ebonmire, and a [[gray ooze]] he called [[Prince Livid]]. Princess Ebonmire and Prince Livid always remained close to the Pudding King.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], after a great battle between the Pudding King's ooze army and all the factions of Blingdenstone gathered together, Princess Ebonmire was killed just before its master by a party of [[adventurer]]s hired by some deep gnome factions after escaping from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]].
