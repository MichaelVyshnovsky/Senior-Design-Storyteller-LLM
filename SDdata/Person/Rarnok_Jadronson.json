As a member of the Teeth, his own teeth were sharpened to points.\nRarnok had a +1 greataxe, the hilt of which was studded with the teeth of his past victims.\nRarnoks father was Jadron the Fang, founder of the Teeth.\nRarnok was sent as the leader of five more Teeth mercenaries to aid in the Zhentarim invasion of Shadowdale in 1375 DR. They attacked and destroyed the village of Oakwood Knoll alongside mercenaries from the Skull and Club, losing two ogre warriors in the process. Later the two groups argued over the spoils, almost coming to blows, but may have been interrupted and slain by passing adventurers on their way to relieve Shadowdale."
