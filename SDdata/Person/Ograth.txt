'''Ograth''' was a leader of a marauder gang that prowled on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ograth was an unusually large [[orc]]ish man.

==Posessions==
Ograth carried an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[halberd]] and a magical ''+2'' [[dagger]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Ograth's marauders preyed on the travelers and caravans that moved along the coastal roads in the environs of [[Neverwinter]]. He sought to perform a mystic ritual called the ''[[Eye of the Gruumsh]]'', in which a powerful orc honors his deity by plucking his own eye out and then slaughtering someone or something. If Ograth were to perform the ritual, his bloodthirsty ray may have had led him to attack a band of adventurers who worked with merchant [[Sa'Sani]] or a camp of [[Eldreth Veluuthra]].
