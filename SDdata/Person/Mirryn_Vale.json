        "mainbody": "irryn Vale was an elven priestess of Amaunator in the late 15 century DR.\nMirryn had tied-back brown hair and light skin. She wore a suit of fine chain mail decorated in the stylings of Amaunator.\nShe was rather nonplussed at the dwarves obsession with the Jewels of Ardor found in Tethyamar, and was completely unaware of the demonic magic behind it.\nMirryn came to Tethyamar and visited the Tethyamar mining outpost in the mid-1480s DR in order to provide healing and aid to those that delved into the ruins of the city and its mines."
