He'd had to learn how to captain ships and move them like weapons, instead of merely stealing from their crews in passing.''|[[Rilder Surtlash]]}}",
        "Description": "Ilder was one of three chancellors who advised Lord of Nimpeth â€“ Woren, despite having little skills to be an Admiral or even just a member of the navy. However, he was a quick-witted and subtle man.",
        "History": "Before Lord Woren became the leader of Nimpeth in the 14{{th}} century DR, Ilder Taramont made his name via deceit, trickery, and theft. When Woren rose to power, Ilder Taramont weaseled himself into the new Lord's good graces and was assigned the position of Nimpeth's Admiral. By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Ilder learned the trade and commanded around twenty ships. His own ship was named ''Wine & Song'' from which the Admiral sent out navy patrols, ordered slave ships escorts, and managed safe sailing for the trade and transports ships that sailed to and from Nimpeth."
