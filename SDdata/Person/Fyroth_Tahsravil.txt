Fyroth Tahsravil was an advisor to Maurandyr who was the High Ward of the fortress town of Hluthvar during the mid-14 century DR.
Fyroth was a skilled warrior and mage who led patrols in the Sunset Vale surrounding Hluthvar. He earned a reputation as a slayer of Zhentarim as rare was the occasion where he failed to return to the fortress without defeating Zhent raiders and patrols.
In truth, Fyroth was a member of the Zhentarim who infiltrated Hluthvar in order to gain access to Maurandyr. He used special spells and magic items to hide his true idendity from his target. He also used unique spells developed within Darkhold to slowly drive Maurandyr mad so he could assume control. All of the Zhents slain by Fyroth during his patrols were viewed as a neccessity by his superiors and were usually those who had outlived their usefulness.
