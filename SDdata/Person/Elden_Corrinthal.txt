'''Elden Corrinthal''', usually known as the '''Oracle''', was the head priest of [[Amaunator]] at the [[Abbey of the Rose]] in [[Sembia]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was the son of [[Abelar Corrinthal]] and [[Eltha]]. In his younger years, he was cared for by the nurse [[Kaesa]].

Elden's best friend in the late 1400s DR was a [[dog]] called [[Browny]]. 

==History==
===Childhood===
Elden was born in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. He lived in [[Corrinthal Estate]] near [[Saerb]] with his nurse [[Kaesa]] when he was four winters old.

However, in the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, during the [[Sembian Civil War]] some troops sent by [[Malkur Forrin]] attacked the estate, killing all inside beside Elden. On [[Nightal 1]], at Abelar's request, [[Erevis Cale]] and [[Drasek Riven]] infiltrated Forrin's camp and Cale healed Elden and took him to safety.

===The Oracle===
In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Elden, now the Oracle, encouraged [[Vasen Cale]] to follow the destiny that Amaunator would show him.

As dictated by a dream sent by his father, the Oracle released the [[spirit]]s of [[Elgrin Fau]] that had kept safe the Abbey for so many years. Later, [[Sayeed]] and [[Zeeahd]] invaded the Abbey with their pack of [[spined devil]]s. The Oracle was confronted by Zeeahd. Elden managed to humiliate Zeehad and so he ordered his spined devils to kill Elden. The Oracle was well prepared for his death and died with a smile.
