Lady '''Remallia Haventree''' ({{Pronounce|reh|MAW|lee|ah|refs=}}) was [[Waterdhavian]] [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noblewoman]] and an agent of the [[Harpers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She famously founded the [[Council of Waterdeep]], a conciliary body that united the [[Five Factions]] of the [[Sword Coast]] against the emergent threat of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the 1480s DR.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}}{{ToD-time}}

{{Quote|We have an evil wizard situation and [[Thay]] is involved. No surprises there.|Lady Remallia, in reference to the [[Red Wizards]].}}

==Description==
Remallia had distinctly bronze-colored skin.{{Cite adventurers league/Unsafe Harborage|16}} Despite her [[elven]] heritage, she had aged considerably during a few short decades in her life.

She dressed in elegant finery that included beauteous [[robe]]s and non-ostentatious jewelry.

==Personality==
Lady Remallia was honest and friendly. She understood the threats that faced the Realms, but understood the caution of her fellow Harpers. She also agreed to compromise with lesser evils to fight more nefarious but not at all prices.

Not one to open dialogue, Remi let others speak first before saying her piece.{{Cite adventurers league/Unsafe Harborage|16}}

==Possessions==
Among her possessions was a large oil painting of her family, created before her husband's death some time during the mid—to—late 15{{th}} century.{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|5}}

She was rather fond of [[ticklemint tea]],{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|4}} which she served in [[silver]] kettle with [[porcelain]] teacups.

==Abilities==
She was at the very least proficient in [[divination]] magic.

==Relationships==
Lady Remallia was married [[Arthagast Ulbrinter]] of the noble [[Ulbrinter]] family. Together they had two children: [[Arhtius|Arthius]], their son that lived in [[Silverymoon]], and [[Serenore]], their daughter that lived with her family on the island of [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshaes]].

She notably worked with [[Zehira Deryan]], a protector of [[storm giant]] queen [[Serissa]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows in the Stacks|18}}

==History==
[[File:Remi.png|thumb|right|300px|Lady Haventree was a skilled spellcaster.]]
Remallia was a noble sun elf living in [[Waterdeep]] in [[Ulbrinter Villa]], once the home of her husband Arthagast. At some point she joined the Harpers. 

===Tyranny of Dragons===
During the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon raided Ulbrinter Villa in search of a [[White Dragon Mask|draconic artifact]] stolen by a [[Zhentarim]] agent,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 7}} and killed Lord Arthagast.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 8}} Lady Remallia took decisive action in response, methodically and purposefully dismantling the cult's operations with all the resources at her disposal. She was the decisive force in uniting the Five Factions in the Council of Waterdeep, founded to combat the menace of the Cult of the Dragon. For her efforts she was chosen as the Harpers' representative on the Council.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}

===Against the Red Wizards===
Lady Remallia then turned her attention towards the Cult of the Dragon's onetime allies, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. She worked with her fellow Harpers and a group of adventurers to investigate a Red Wizard safehouse in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]],{{Cite adventurers league/Unsafe Harborage|3}} then directed them to take information they recovered to [[Candlekeep]] for interpretation.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows in the Stacks|3}} A short time later, she was summoned to the ''[[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]]'' by the storm giant queen Serissa.{{Cite adventurers league/To Walk the Cold Dark|4}}

Remallia's investigation led to the discovery of the [[Tenebrous Creed]], a sect of [[Shar]]-worshiping cultists obsessed with the [[Far Realm]],{{Cite adventurers league/The City That Should Not Be|2}} She worked with adventurers and Harpers in the [[Moonsea]] region to recover a ''[[living spell|living]] [[blade of disaster]]'' that was unearthed by the Red Wizards.{{Cite adventurers league/Night Thieves|2}} Working with Zehira Deryan, Remallia directed the party to form a lookout post [[Abeir]]an necropolis of [[Xorvintroth]] deep underground in [[Icewind Dale]],{{Cite adventurers league/The City That Should Not Be|4}}{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|2}}  and soon joined them in their efforts to spy on the Red Wizards.{{Cite adventurers league/Frozen Whispers|9-10}} 

During her stay in the city, Remallia became afflicted with some unknown malady. She began to unknowingly harm herself, leaving wounds that created ichor-filled boils upon her skin.{{Cite adventurers league/Frozen Whispers|11}} Despite this, she still managed to work with her adventurer allies to free the slaves the Red Wizards had made captive in Xorvintroth,{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|22}}

===Return to Waterdeep===
In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the goddess [[Eilistraee]] returned to the Realms near the walls of Waterdeep. In turn many of the goddess' [[drow]] followers traveled to the City of Splendors ''en masse''. Some of their numbers approached Remallia and requested aid in constructing a temple of Eilistraee in the city. Lady Remallia agreed to provide her support to their cause.{{Page needed}}
