'''Maku''' was a priest shaman and leader of the [[minotaur]]s in the [[Maze Level]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Maku led his fellow twenty-three minotaurs against the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]]. He tried to summon [[Baphomet]] many times but with no success. The [[demon lord]] simply ignored Maku and his tribe but the minotaur believed that if he collected enough sacrificed bodies then the ritual would succeed. For him, all intruders were enemies to add to the pile of bodies.
