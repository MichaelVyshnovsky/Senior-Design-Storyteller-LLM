        "History": "By ''circa'' [[1361 DR]], Amthur was [[Prelate]] of the temple of Deneir in Procampur, where he had the title of [[High Scrivener]]. <ref group=\"note\">Only the ''[[Horde Campaign]]'' names Wenslan Amthur and gives Wenslan the title \"Prelate\". ''[[The Horde]]'' calls an unnamed leader of the temple \"hierarch\", and \"Patronage\" in ''[[Realms of Valor]]'' calls them [[high scrivener]]. ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' page 54 confirms that a high scrivener is the leader of a temple of [[Deneir]], but the precise roles of [[hierarch]] and [[prelate]] are unclear. Given their respective importance, this article assumes they refer to the same position, but it is possible they represent different steps in a church hierarchy, or different structures of this hierarchy over time.\n\nAmthur permitted a historian writing a history of the [[Tuigan Horde]] to examine the temple's complete copy of [[Vilhiard]]'s ''[[A Discovery of the World]]''.\n\nThe High Scrivener praised the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]], who was a guest at his temple in [[1362 DR|the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], for his wisdom and knowledge. The priest [[Foxe]] promised to have the High Scrivener distribute Koja's new work, ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]'', to every other temple of Deneir.The High Scrivener is unnamed in \"Patronage\" in ''[[Realms of Valor]]'', but the date is close enough to that of the ''[[Horde Campaign]]'' to suggest that this is Wenslan Amthur."
