'''Moire''' was a female [[half-elf]] who was a high-ranking member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] chapter in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Moire was a notorious gang leader in Neverwinter's Docks district, part of the Shadow Thieves chapter under [[Axle Devrie]]. Unlike Axle, she was known to be vicious and ruthless and she sought to hold the streets of Neverwinter in her grip.

==History==
She could have met the Kalach-Cha during the [[Shadow War]]. The Kalach-cha could have come into contact with Moire while trying to gain entrance to the [[Blacklake]] district.

If the [[Kalach-Cha]] and companions sided with the [[Watch]], then they ruined many of Moire's activities. During the rescue of the informant [[Fihelis]], Moire herself showed up to kill the spy but was defeated.

If the Kalach-Cha and companions sided with the thieves, then they needed to help advance Moire's activities, by working under her. Finally, the Kalach-Cha rose to work directly for Axle Devrie, the true leader of Neverwinter's Shadow Thieves and a more diplomatic individual than Moire. Finally, Moire broke away from Axle and sought to take control of the Shadow Thieves, taking advantage of the chaos during the evacuation. The Kalach-Cha could resolve this situation either by killing her, killing Axle for her, or killing them both.<ref>
