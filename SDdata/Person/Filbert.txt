==Personality==
Filbert had a quirky and mischievous personality, a habit of withholding information, and an amorous nature. He also loved [[pistachio]]s.

==History==
The Great and Magnificent and Also Irresistibly Handsome Filbert hame home in a garden of luminescent and brightly-colored giant [[mushroom]]s in the roots of a massive tree at the heart of the Resurrection Gorge some years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. Unaware or uninterested in the [[Vernus]]'s circle in a hollow of the tree, Fil carried one of the magic stones that served as a lock that sealed an ancient great evil and could summon a [[glabrezu]]. The faerie dragon was willing to exchange his rock for some pretty glowing crystals â€“ aphrodisiacs to woo local female faerie dragons. The crystals grew to the northeast from the great tree. However, the dragon failed to disclose that a nest of [[ankheg]]s was just underneath the crystal garden.
