Eldeth Feldrun was a shield dwarf scout who was made a prisoner of the drow during the late 1480s DR.
Eldeth lived with her family in Gauntlgrym, where she worked as a scout.
In the late 1480s DR, Eldeth was captured by the drow slavers of Velkynvelve and had been attempting to return home.
The dwarf was high-spirited, defiant and self-sacrificing, and she had great pride in her heritage and in her peoples recent reclamation of Gauntlgrym. She was also stubborn and hated drow and other "corrupt dark dwellers" like derro and duergar.
