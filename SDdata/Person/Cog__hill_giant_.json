        "mainbody": "Cog was one of two hill giants that were assigned to guard the Maelstroms throne room in the late 15 century DR.\nCog was noted as being exceptionally unintelligent and easy to deceive. He was so fearful of angering Imperator Uthor that he would never leave his post, even if it meant allowing people to escape into the throne room.\nIn his duty as a guard, Cog wore chainmail armor and wielded a club fit for a giant. He also wore a helmet, though it was ill-fitting for someone of his size."
