        "mainbody": "'''Cog''' was one of two [[hill giant]]s that were assigned to guard the [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom's]] throne room in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Cog was noted as being exceptionally unintelligent and easy to deceive. He was so fearful of angering Imperator [[Uthor]] that he would never leave his post, even if it meant allowing people to escape into the throne room.",
        "Possessions": "In his duty as a guard, Cog wore [[chainmail]] armor and wielded a [[club]] fit for a giant. He also wore a helmet, though it was ill-fitting for someone of his size."
