Tsenshivah was a dragon turtle in the Dragon Coast in 1374 DR.
Tsenshivah lived in an area of the Dragon Coast between Teziir and Westgate with her mate.
In 1374 DR, the local fishermen killed her mate so she went into a frenzy until she was approached by Reveilaein Brant and his Cult of the Dragon cell. He promised Tsenshivah the power to have her vengeance, by becoming a dracolich. Until then, she patrolled the area around the abandoned lighthouse that the cell used as it headquarters.
