'''Tsenshivah''' was a [[dragon turtle]] in the [[Dragon Coast]] in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Tsenshivah lived in an area of the Dragon Coast between [[Teziir]] and [[Westgate]] with her mate.

In 1374 DR, the local fishermen killed her mate so she went into a frenzy until she was approached by [[Reveilaein Brant]] and his [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell. He promised Tsenshivah the power to have her vengeance, by becoming a [[dracolich]]. Until then, she patrolled the area around the abandoned lighthouse that the cell used as it headquarters.
