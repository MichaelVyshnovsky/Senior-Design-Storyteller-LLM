'''Phelpar''' was a [[mage]] of note from [[Rassatan]] in [[Samarach]] who lived some time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Phelpar ''[[polymorph]]ed'' his rival [[Selvar]] into a [[frog]] for several years. He used this opportunity to steal all of Selvar's [[spell]]s and [[magic item]]s and hid them in a secret cache in a tomb in the [[Rathgaunt Hills]] in the [[Shaar]]. Selvar was somehow able to transform himself back to his natural form and tracked Phelpar down to exact his revenge. He ''polymorphed'' Phelpar into a horse and rode him to death, then used his magic to speak with his corpse and learn the location of his magical cache so he could reclaim his stolen magic.
