'''Branimern Rythil''' was a [[Red Wizard]] [[conjurer]] and [[Nar demonbinder]] that sought out the unholy secrets of the ancient [[Narfell]] empire during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. After transforming herself into a [[cambion]], she went on to establish a stronghold in the ruins of [[Jastaath Castle]] on [[Mount Nar]] in the 15{{th}} century DR.

==Relationships==
She once served as the subordinate of the [[Zulkir]] of [[Conjuration]] [[Nevron]] before traveling to the [[Cold Lands]] outside of [[Thay]]. She felt great fear directed towards her former master.

Her familiar was an [[imp]] that accompanied her on her travels.

As of the 15{{th}} century DR, she had made a powerful ally in [[Hughan]], a twisted [[fomorian]] warrior.

==Activities==
Branimern was a researcher searching for the secrets of ancient [[Nar]] [[demonbinding]].

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Branimern was studying ancient [[Nar]] ruins in the [[Great Dale]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, she ventured into the ruins of [[Val Murthag]] in order to recover whatever information possible about ancient, demonic Nar rituals. She subsequently discovered a way to transform herself into a [[cambion]], and proceeded to surround herself with minions ranging from [[fiends]] to corrupted [[fey]], including fomorians and [[cyclops]]es.

After finishing her research in the Great Dale, Branimern led her minions to Mount Nar where she hoped to unearth the earliest secrets of the Nars from the ruins of [[Jastaath]], where it was said the first Nars to parley with [[demon]]s had lived. Around or before the {{YearlinkName|1439}}, she and her entourage destroyed the [[dracolich]] [[Kryonar]] who had long laired on the mountain, and then proceeded to construct a stronghold on the western face of the peak amidst the ruins of Jastaath Castle. Her towering lair was visible all the way from [[Bildoobaris]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, she was continuing to pursue the secrets of the Nars, and had grand plans to conquer Narfell, the Great Dale, [[Rashemen]], and even [[Thay]].
