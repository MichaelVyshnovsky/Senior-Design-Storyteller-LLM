        "History": "Gretchen found her vocation as a druid in a grove of [[willow]] trees near [[Waterdeep]]. She visited often, content to enjoy the silence of the woods. One day, the willow trees began speaking to her. They took her under their boughs, telling her stories and teaching her many willow-secrets over the course of a full year. At year's end she was given a huge gem that allowed her to commune with the willows always, and was sent off to wander under the wise guidance of the trees. Eventually she was tasked with traveling to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] to put down an evil presence and plant a willow tree."
