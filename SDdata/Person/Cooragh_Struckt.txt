Cooragh Struckt was the half-orc cook of the Wayside Inn in the late 15 century DR.
Tattoos of curving daggers could be found on Cooraghs neck, beneath each ear. She got them in her adolescent years to annoy her mother, a Luskan human.
Cooragh was known for her delectable stews and meat pies, which were notoriously spicy.
Cooragh was a long-time companion of Martisha Vinetalker, the owner of the inn.
Circa 1491 DR, the Wayside Inn was attacked by undead that had been created by a cult of Myrkul. A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.
Later, the cult of Talos led by Fheralai Stormsworn took over the inn. The guests of the inn were impaled as sacrifices to the Stormbringer. The cultists tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos and summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn in the process. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able stop the ritual in time. However, the Talos cultists successfully kidnapped Tarbin Tul, a local bard.
