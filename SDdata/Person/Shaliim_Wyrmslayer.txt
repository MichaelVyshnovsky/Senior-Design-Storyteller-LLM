'''Shaliim Wyrmslayer''' was a [[Tashalan]] [[human]] [[fighter]], [[sorcerer]], and [[eldritch knight]]; one-time world-walking [[adventurer]]; and the Prince Royal and later Overking of [[Lapaliiya]], ruling from the Palace of the Overking in the capital city of [[Sheirtalar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|21}}

==Relations==
He was the son of [[Mhartuk]], the Overking of Lapaliiya.

==History==
Around [[1353 DR]], Prince Shaliim set off to adventure across [[Faerûn]], looking for excitement, achievement, and a wife. He met and became friends with a band of younger sons of [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]] who'd also taken up adventuring, nicknamed "wildblades", and who were rich and well-equipped with [[magic item]]s. In the upper room of a dancing house in a seedier part of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward]], they discovered an ancient ''[[gate]]'' that in turn led to a network of ''gates'' linking to other [[plane]]s and [[planet]]s. Naturally, they used it to explore these other worlds.The original article in ''Polyhedron'' #64 says Shaliim's adventuring career lasted "the past four seasons", suggesting one year, and that he met the wildblades "recently", likely within that year. However, ''Serpent Kingdoms'' writes "after four years of adventuring with a band of Waterdhavian wildblades". The later source is adopted here.

On one of these worlds, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Shaliim and the wildblades came across a kingdom of [[dwarves]] and humans ruled over by a group of powerful [[dragon aging|elder]] [[black dragon]]s known as the [[Black Wyrms]]. The adventurers were quickly captured and enslaved, but battled to escape. In the end, Shaliim, who had not previously done much that was remarkable, even jumped inside the mouth of one of the black wyrms and killed it from the inside, thus gaining his epithet. On the way, they even robbed from the dragons' hoard.

That same year, they safely returned to [[Toril]], each with a great fortune and much strange and potent magic, and went their separate ways, with most of the wildblades settling back into Waterdeep. He formally took the name "Wyrmslayer", ordering his heralds to add it to his royal lineage and to the names of any children he had in future.

Over the next ten years, he was forced to battle many thieves, particularly from [[Thay]] and [[Calimshan]], who came after the treasures and magic items he'd won on his adventures.

At last, in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, his aged father died of [[heartstop]] and Shaliim became Overking of Lapaliiya. He moved into the Palace of the Overking in Sheirtalar.

However, the Black Wyrms were seeking revenge. Following ten years of effort, they tracked the wildblades back to Toril, located the adventurers themselves, and discreetly killed them, one by one. News of the disappearances eventually reached Shaliim and, in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, a [[black dragon]] was even sighted swimming in [[Talar Bay]]. In response, Shaliim stayed sheltered within the Domed Palace as he worked desperately on a plan. He thought to hire a group of adventurers to make an expedition into the [[Mhair Jungles]] and seek lore from a time when the [[yuan-ti]] fought with the great old [[dragon]]s of [[Faerûn]]. But, as he was unable to represent the realm in person, Lapaliiya's trade suffered and concerns were circulated privately around the court.

==Personality==
He was proud and willful and, as his battle with the black dragon showed, capable of ruthless and even reckless courage in battle.

==Possessions==
According to spies, among the magical items that Shaliim won on his adventures was an [[construct|automaton]] made from black metal in the form of a beautiful and shapely human woman and possessing incredible power. Shaliim once ordered it to attack a pair of [[iron golem]] guardians and it handily destroyed them.
