'''Erixitl''' was a young [[Maztican]] [[priestess]] of [[Qotal]] and the wife of the former [[Golden Legion]] officer [[Halloran]] in the second part of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Erixitl was described as a beautiful woman with brown skin and long black hair.

==Equipment==
Erix wore a powerful ''[[pluma]]'' [[amulet]] made by her father that protected her from most magical attacks. She also wore the ''[[Cloak of One Plume]]'', which was a sign of her favor with Qotal.

==History==
At the age of 10, Erixitl was taken captive and held as a slave in the city of [[Kultaka]]. After being attacked by the son of her owner, Erixitl was sold to [[Kachin]], a [[cleric]] of the [[god]] Qotal in [[Ulatos]]. Kachin freed Erixitl and told her she was to become a priestess. However, Erix was kidnapped by a priest of [[Zaltec]] and taken to be sacrificed at a pyramid on top of the [[Twin Visages]]. She managed to escape and the daughter of an [[Amn]]nian bishop of [[Helm]] was sacrificed in her place, which led to war between the [[Golden Legion]] and [[Ulatos]]. Erixitl was nearly killed during the battle between the Amnians and Ulatans but the Legionnaire [[Halloran]] rescued her.

Halloran and Erixitl escaped into the jungle, eventually making their way to [[Nexal]]. Erixitl had visions of the destruction of Nexal and she wanted to do everything in her power to prevent this from happening. Erix and Halloran had a disagreement and Erix traveled back to her home village of [[Palul]]. She arrived just before the Golden Legion and she was pressed into service as a translator. Erixitl survived the massacre at Palul and was once again rescued by Hal, who had raced to Palul when he heard the Legion was heading to the village.

Hal was seriously injured by a fellow Legionnaire and Erix nursed him back to health.  Hal and Erix were married by her father and he gave them both powerful [[feathermagic]] bracers as a wedding gift. Afterwards, the couple journeyed back to [[Nexal]] in a desperate attempt to prevent a war between the Golden Legion and Nexal.
