==Activities==
Imam Moral oversaw over 200 priests of [[Jisan]], clerical brethren, and laymen. He was also one of the richest people in Huzuz, owning over 50 houses and business.

He was involved with a nasty dispute with the mosque of Jisan in [[Hiyal]] because of their involvement with the [[Gilded Palm]], a notorious group of [[holy slayer]]s. Three attempts on his life were made, but he survived them all. He suspected that members of the Gilded Palms were able to infiltrate his clergy.

==Possessions==
Moral wore ''[[Armor of the desert evening|chain mail of the desert evening]]'', and owned a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'', ''[[boots of striding and leaping|sandals of striding and leaping]]''. He always carried a ''[[lens of appraisal]]''. His recent acquisitions included a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'' and a ''[[staff of striking]]''.
