'''Staephon Gylesman''' was a [[human]] man living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was the proprietor of the [[Lantern Inn and Boathouse]] by [[1358 DR]] and still held the position in [[1369 DR]].

Though he managed the inn, his more profitable service was, in fact, renting small boats and barges to patrons. These could be made available at any hour, without fuss, delay, or being seen.

Staephon was also an expert in old ballads and literature of [[north Faerûn]]. He was a bluff but cheerful man.
