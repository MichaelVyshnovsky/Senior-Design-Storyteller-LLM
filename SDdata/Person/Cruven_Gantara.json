        "mainbody": "ruven Gantara was a barbarian warrior from Tuern whose legacy was the subject of much interest by the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was a known traveling companion of Belast Messandar, an elven adventurer.\nAfter his death, Cruven was interred within the Valley of the Ancients near Ebon Downs in the Silverwisp Swamp. His burial mound was marked by four small obelisks, each of which were protected by a handful of spectral guardians.\nAs of the 1480s DR, Cruven was believed to have been the last person to travel through the portal on Tuern that linked the island to the mainland of Faer√ªn.The Neverwinter Tyranny of Dragons module states the portal terminates on the Sword Coast while other sources state its location in Icewind Dale. Around that same time the portal was highly sought after by the Cult of the Dragon,"
