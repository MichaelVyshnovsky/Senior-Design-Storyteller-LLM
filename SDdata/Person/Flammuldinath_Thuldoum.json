        "mainbody": "'''Flammuldinath \"Firefingers\" Thuldoum''' was a mage in [[Thentia]] in {{yearlink|1367}} and in {{yearlink|1373}}.",
        "Description": "As of 1373 [[DR]], to [[Taegan Nightwind]], Firefingers looked like \"some fortunate child's doting grandfather\"; he was stooped, wrinkled, had a white beard, and wore robes of scarlet, orange, and gold.",
        "Relationships": "Firefingers was the teacher of [[Maganus]]. He came to him just before the [[Time of Troubles]]; the tutor found him even then wizened before his years and full of anger. The sorceresses [[Jannatha Goldenshield]] and [[Baerimel Dunnath]] were also trained by him.",
        "History": "Firefingers was one of the mages in Thentia assisting [[Karasendrieth]]'s party in decoding [[Sammaster]]'s notes about the [[Rage of Dragons]] in 1373 DR. He also may have told the [[Hero of Daggerford]] what he knew of Maganus that same year."
