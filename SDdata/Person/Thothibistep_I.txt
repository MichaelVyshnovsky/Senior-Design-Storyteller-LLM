Thothibistep I was born in 861 DR. He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 922 DR, after the former pharaoh Ramenhorus II had died in battle against the Red Wizards of Thay He intended to rule as pharaoh only until a suitable incarnation of Horus-Re could take the throne.
Thothibistep Is reign lasted until 925 DR, when he was slain by the wizard Namrek following the Spelldoom.
