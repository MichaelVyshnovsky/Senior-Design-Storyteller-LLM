        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-7975}}, Umyatin founded the city of Inupras, capital of the Imaskari empire, and gave himself the title of Lord Artificer.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In the spring of the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, [[Ususi Manaallin]] found two Imaskari murals in a ruin on the border between [[Veldorn]] and [[Estagund]]. The murals depicted, to her judgement, two different emperors of Imaskar, Umyatin and [[Omanond]]. The figure she believed to represent Umyatin was surrounded by two demonic figures: one of a [[dragon]] with a [[lion]]'s head, and one of a midnight-black [[centaur]] with a [[demon]]'s horn and a vicious look of glee in his eyes. Umyatin was reaching out to the latter, which was labeled \"Mizar\".",
        "Other": "One of Ususi Manaallin's offensive spells was known as the ''[[Umyatin's decomposition|decomposition of Umyatin]]''.\n\nUmyatin had created four dragonchess sets, each of them weighing 30 pounds, with beautifully carved and enameled pieces. Collectors valued the collection at 2500 gp. One of them was in [[Undermountain]], in [[Maddgoth's Castle]], as of {{yearlink|1492}}."
