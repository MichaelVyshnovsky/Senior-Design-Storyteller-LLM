'''Gondolo''' ({{Pronounce|GON|doh|loh|refs=}}) was an unsuccessful treasure seeker and the companion of his foppish friend, [[Faroul]]. Together, they hired themselves out as guides in [[Port Nyanzaru]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Gondolo was a [[lightfoot halfling]] with a flabby build. He stood at {{SI|3'6"|ft-in|c|long=yes}} and weighed {{SI|80|pounds|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Gondolo enjoyed carousing and living a life of debauchery and gambling, especially alongside Faroul. He was notably lucky, especially when it came to narrowly escaping danger.

Gondolo was fond of sharing important-sounding facts. While he thought himself to be a philosopher, he often supplanted any actual knowledge with his own fabricated ideas. He further fancied himself as both a poet and a boxer.

==Relationships==
Gondolo and Faroul owned a [[triceratops]] named [[Zongo]] they intended to enter into [[dinosaur races]] in Port Nyanzaru. They used it as a pack beast due to its lethargic nature.

==History==
When Faroul was sent away to Port Nyanzaru by his parents, Gondolo joined him to help seek their fortunes and live the high life. In a matter of months, the two lavished their money away on gambling and earned significant debts with both the city's dinosaur race bookies as well as its [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]].

Around this time, Gondolo met a [[Disease|feverish]] explorer desperate for money to pay for a voyage home to [[Baldur's Gate]]. This explorer offered to sell him a [[map|treasure map]] and, desperate for cash, Gondolo agreed. The map showed the location of a [[Needle's Bones|deceased dragon's former lair]]. As Gondolo and Faroul didn't have the wherewithal to travel there on their own, they posed as jungle guides in the hopes that they could venture to the dragon's lair with a group of [[adventurer]]s and equally split whatever treasure of the hoard remained.
