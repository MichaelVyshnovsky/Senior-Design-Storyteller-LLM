Salember Obarskyr was the regent of Cormyr in the late 13 century DR.
He was the son of King Palaghard Obarskyr II and Queen Alendue Wyrvar Salember had two brothers, Lhannas and Azoun III.
When Azoun III died, Prince Rhigaerd was only six years old, so Salember took the throne of Cormyr as regent. Salember plotted to kill Rhigaerd and take the throne, leading Cormyr into civil war.
When he refused to relinquish the throne, he was killed by the royal wizard Jorunhast.
