'''Rai-guy Bondalek''', also known as '''Rai'gy''', was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] and former high [[priest]] and a lieutenant of [[Bregan D'aerthe]].

==History==
Originally from the destroyed [[House Teyachumet]] of [[Ched Nasad]],

In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, together with [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], another lieutenant of Bregan D'aerthe, Rai-guy betrayed [[Jarlaxle]] when Jarlaxle began falling under the influence of the sentient artifact [[Crenshinibon]]. Rai-guy also desired Crenshinibon for himself. When he finally obtained it, however, he was killed by the [[red dragon]] [[Hephaestus]] after Jarlaxle tricked the wyrm into breathing fire on the crystal and subsequently its wielder, Rai-guy.
