Dramordugas was a native of Thay who later visited Suzail in Cormyr.
Unbeknownst to him at the time, Dramordugas would be a pivotal player in the renaming of the tavern that would be called the Dragons Jaws in Suzail. While visiting a local tavern, Dramordugas picked a fight with a female wizard who was actually a gold dragon in disguise. Dramordugas time on Toril ended that night, and the Dragons Jaws was born.
