'''Dramordugas''' was a native of [[Thay]] who later visited [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]].

==History==
Unbeknownst to him at the time, Dramordugas would be a pivotal player in the renaming of the tavern that would be called [[the Dragon's Jaws]] in Suzail. While visiting a local tavern, Dramordugas picked a fight with a female [[wizard]] who was actually a [[gold dragon]] in disguise. Dramordugas' time on [[Toril]] ended that night, and the Dragon's Jaws was born.
