Sinazith was a githyanki monk who died in the 15 century DR, killed as a result of her interaction with the Cult of the Absolute.
Sinazith was a lanky gith woman with yellowish coloration and gray splotches on her skin. She had blue eyes and light brown hair, braided in tight cornrows.
Sinazith was an outcast among her kin, owing to her dedication to a certain monastic tradition. In the , she came into contact with the Cult of the Absolute and was infected with their altered illithid tadpole. When Sinaziths fellow githyanki found out about the infection, she was slain immediately as an aberration. Her soul yearned for revenge and ended up among the hand-picked dozen individuals plucked from the Fugue Plane, chosen by the entity called Withers to aid in his campaign against the Dead Three and their Cult of the Absolute.
