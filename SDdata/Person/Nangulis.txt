'''Nangulis''' was [[Kiril Duskmourn]]'s fiancee, and a [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] in charge of the [[Inner Bastion]] of [[Stardeep]]. He sacrificed himself in order to create the sword ''[[Angul]]'', so as to prevent the escape of [[Carnis|the Traitor]].

==Description==
As far as [[Kiril Duskmourn]] remembered, Nangulis was tall, silver-haired, with dark, intense, enthralling eyes.{{cite book/Stardeep|111}}

==Personality==
In Kiril's memory, Nangulis was an "unbending, saintly bastard".{{cite book/Darkvision|33-34}} When briefly manifest in 1375 DR, he was composed and devoted to his duty as a Keeper, yet still in love with Kiril.

==Abilities==
To Kiril's judgement, Nangulis had grown more powerful by becoming ''Angul''.

==Possessions==
He wielded a ''[[starblade]]''.{{cite book/Darkvision|136|14}} He also bore one of the [[Cerulean Sign]]s, which was later entrusted to Commander [[Brathtar]].{{cite book/Stardeep|174}}

==Activities==
Nangulis was the [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] in charge of the [[Inner Bastion]] of [[Stardeep]]. In his free time, he and Kiril loved to take long walks in the [[Yuirwood]].{{cite book/Stardeep|112}}

==Relationships==
Nangulis was engaged to Kiril, but the escape of [[Carnis|the Traitor]] prevented them from marrying.{{cite book/Stardeep|61}}

==History==
Nangulis had known Kiril Duskmourn long before becoming a Keeper. He served five years together with Kiril.

During a breach by the Traitor, Nangulis, Kiril and [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]] were forced to call upon ancient Keeper Lore and use Nangulis' soul to create a weapon capable of seriously damaging the Traitor, thus synthesizing the blade ''[[Angul]]''.{{cite book/Stardeep|63-65}}{{cite book/Stardeep|208-209}} This took most of his soul, but the leftovers were later encapsulated and preserved by Cynosure; Keeper [[Telarian]] used those later to construct the blade ''[[Nis]]''.{{cite book/Stardeep|76-79}}{{cite book/Stardeep|281-282}}

In {{yearlink|1375}}, Keeper Telarian instructed his agent, [[Gage]], to tell Kiril that Nangulis was the one seeking the Blade Cerulean, in order to draw her to Stardeep.{{cite book/Stardeep|177}} Once in Stardeep, Telarian struck at Kiril with Nis; when she parried with Angul and the blades struck together, they merged into a new weapon, ''Angul-Nis''. As a result, Nangulis' soul was rejoined and made whole, and he was briefly able to talk to Kiril.{{cite book/Stardeep|289-291}} Tragically, it was necessary for Nangulis to sacrifice himself again in order to split ''Angul-Nis'' back into two blades, so that Telarian could not use it to undo the wards keeping the Traitor sealed. Nangulis kept Kiril's mind focused and then accepted the task,{{cite book/Stardeep|296-298}} but the sword did not fully sunder until Telarian was distracted by a backstab from Gage, destroying Nangulis again.{{cite book/Stardeep|300-301}}
