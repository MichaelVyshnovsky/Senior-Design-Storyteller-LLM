'''Raynaar Marliir''' was the head of the [[Marliir]] noble family of [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Activities==
As a landlord, he was seen as benevolent to tenant farmers. He also maintained good relations with most merchant companies, excepting the more exploitative ones.

Around [[1367 DR]], Raynaar was more often at the family's seat in Arabel than at the Royal Court in [[Suzail]], owing to the family's focus on improving its own power base, not in intrigues of the court.

==Relations==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], he was married to Duchess [[Merelda Marliir]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Lord Raynaar and Lady [[Terese Marliir]] attended a birthday feast for King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]], and spent the night as guests of Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at his manor, [[Thistleflame Keep]]. They knew nothing about Lord Thistle's apparent murder that evening.
