'''Xullrae Dhuurniv''' was the youngest of the Matron Sisters of [[House Dhuurniv]] involved in the [[Zhent]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]].

==History==
Although Xullrae allied together with her sisters with the [[Zhentarim]] the Matron Sisters had plots in minds different from the objective of the Zhent and the [[Shar]]rans; the true plan of Xullrae was recreate a swarm of [[spider fire]], an ancient kind of spider, and unleash them in the [[Cormanthor]] forest to burn it down.
