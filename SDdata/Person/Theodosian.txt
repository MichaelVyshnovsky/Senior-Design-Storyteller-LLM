==History==
Unlike so many of his fallen brethren, Theodosian survived the initial occupation and attempted reclamation of Helm's Hold ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. He accompanied [[Dunfield|Captain Dunfield]] to the [[Last Redoubt]] war camp formed by the [[Neverwinter Guard]] and assisted in the efforts to [[Siege of Helm's Hold|retake the city]]. He served as a healer at the camp, and aided in the efforts to bless the remains of his allies who fell on the battlefield.
