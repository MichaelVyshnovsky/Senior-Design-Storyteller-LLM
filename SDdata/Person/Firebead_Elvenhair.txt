'''Firebead Elvenhair''' was a [[mage]] from [[Beregost]],{{Cite dragon/255/Baldur's Gate: Candlekeep|50}}

{{Quote|Ah yes, I'm back within the hallowed halls of [[Candlekeep]]. With this [[iron crisis]] upon us, the trip from [[Beregost]] was more hazardous than I care to relate...|Firebead Elvenhair, in [[1368 DR]].}}

==Abilities==
As a scholar, Firebead was knowledgeable in etiquette, heraldry, and history, both ancient and modern.

==Activities==
For his services to Candlekeep, Firebead was granted the status as "friend" of Candlekeep and allowed to enter the monastery-fortress without bestowing upon its guardians the entry fee of a valuable or rare [[tome]]. That fact that he made purchases for the library was a badly kept secret among the book dealers of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Beregost]].

==Relationships==
He was an acquaintance if not a friend of both the [[Harper]] sage [[Gorion]], and [[Tethtoril]] Candlekeep's wise and kind First Reader.

==History==
During the [[iron crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Firebead was searching for a copy of the book, ''[[The History of the Fateful Coin]]''.
