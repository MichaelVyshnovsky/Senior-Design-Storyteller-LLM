Keren Donnell was the most famous bard in the Ffolk-inhabited Moonshae Isles.
Keren used a longbow as tall as a man made of black Callidyrr yew. It was one of a dozen or so weapons that were crafted by the High Kings own bowyer. He had a falcon companion named Sable.
While visiting Gwynneth on official business for the High King of the Moonshaes in 1345 DR, he helped Tristan Kendrick and his companions in a fight against a band of firbolgs. They led him to Caer Corwell so he could speak to King Kendrick. On his way back to Caer Callidyrr, he was captured by a band of firbolgs led by Groth and then rescued by Tristan, alongside Finellen the dwarf and Kamerynn the unicorn. It was at this time that Tristan found the legendary sword of Cymrych Hugh.
With the discovery of the sword, Keren decided to stay with Tristan and company and began composing a ballad about the invasion and Tristans journeys. Keren was influential in providing moral support to the armies as they battles Northmen at Freemans Down and Caer Corwell. He also accompanied Tristan as he went to track-down the beast Kazgaroth after the failed battle at Caer Corwell. At this battle, Keren was disintegrated by the Beast, and his comrades Pawldo and Daryth were slain as well. The Earthmother was able to ressurrect everyone except for Keren, due his disintegration. In exchange, his ballad was spread to the minds of all the bards of the Moonshaes.
