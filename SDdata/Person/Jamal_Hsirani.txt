Jamal Hsirani was a human proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Azuth.
Jamal was a rather tall man, with dark skin and curly hair. He typically dressed in lionskins.
This proxy had a fondness for making grand entrances and disappearing sneakily.
Jamal carried around a bone staff that was the size of a grown human.
Jamal was last seen in Mechanus on the layer of Nemausus, working alongside a proxy named Feryli Krenurum in helping the resistance movement of Arcadian petitioners there to avoid the modron hunters. His aid was considered to be a pivotal factor in the resistances efforts to live in Nemausus following its shift from Arcadia.
