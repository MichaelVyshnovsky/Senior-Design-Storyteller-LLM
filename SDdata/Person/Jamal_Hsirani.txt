This proxy had a fondness for making grand entrances and disappearing sneakily.

==Possessions==
Jamal carried around a bone staff that was the size of a grown human.

==History==
Jamal was last seen in [[Mechanus]] on the layer of [[Nemausus]], working alongside a proxy named [[Feryli Krenurum]] in helping the resistance movement of [[Arcadia]]n [[petitioner]]s there to avoid the [[modron]] hunters. His aid was considered to be a pivotal factor in the resistance's efforts to live in Nemausus following its shift from Arcadia.
