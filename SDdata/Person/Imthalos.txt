'''Imthalos''' was the precept of the city of [[Murghyr]] in [[Murghôm]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Imthalos was a powerful [[priest]] of [[Horus-Re]]. His position was desirable among the precepts of [[Mulhorand]] as the position also served as ambassador and diplomat to Murghôm, allowing for a respite from the infighting among the Mulhorandi.
