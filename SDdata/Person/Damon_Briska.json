        "mainbody": "Damon Briska was an individual that lived in the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“15 century DR.\nDamon had some amount of elven blood, as his great-uncle was a half-elf.\nDamon was a forthright and outspoken individual who was proud to be a free Citizen of the Heartlands.\nSome time after the nation of Elturgard was formed, Elturian Hellriders began riding across the surrounding lands, patrolling for dangers that may plague the region. Damon vehemently disagreed with that level of overreach by the military organization. In response, Damon penned Regarding Strange Riders in These Parts, and posted it in settlements across the lands. The village of Moonhaven was among those sites."
