Ilyana Wyrmmruff was an innkeeper in Skullport.
Ilyana was the driving force behind the success of the inn her organizational skills kept the building running efficiently. She was scared of spiders. Ilyana liked her current life but had a yearning for her adventuring days. She knew that her life was passing and waited for the day that the Trollsinge Vanguard would again be full, in the afterlife.
Ilyana worked alongside her former adventuring companion Eulagad.
Around 1370 DR, Ilyana managed the Burning Troll inn with Eulagad.
Ilyana was once one of the most talented cat-burglars in Waterdeep. She joined the Trollsinge Vanguard party and they survived many adventures. Like Eulagad, Ilyana retired after the death of her friends and for a long time they managed an inn in Skullport.
