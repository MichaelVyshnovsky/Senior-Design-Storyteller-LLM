        "mainbody": "'''Ghleanna Stormlake''' was a [[half-elf|half-elven]] [[sorceress]] apprentice of [[Elminster Aumar]] and one of the [[Veiled Ones]], the adventurers who stood against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Ghleanna was a thin and delicate young woman, {{SI|5'6|'\"|long=yes}} tall, with wheat-golden hair. Her eyes were golden-flecked blue. Her slightly pointed years betrayed her mixed heritage and the blueish tint to her ears and chin exposed her [[moon elf]] descent.\n\nShe preferred to wear [[wizard]]'s [[robe]]s when studying or working in a laboratory. When traveling or adventuring, she could often be seen dressed in brown [[leggings]], knee-high [[leather]] [[boots]], a loose tunic, and a hooded [[cloak]] of dark-green color.",
        "Personality": "Because of her childhood trauma and deeply ingrained inferiority complex, Ghleanna often took a neutral stance in arguments, trying to appease all sides and acting as a mediator. For the same reason, she had an introverted personality. However, she was unafraid of speaking up when she had an opinion she felt was worth sharing with others.",
        "Abilities": "As a sorcerer, Ghleanna was trained in use of simple weapons like [[dagger]]s, with [[staves]] being her favorite. She possessed deep knowledge of the arcane, elven history, spellcrafting, and was a skilled diplomat.\n\nGhleanna had access to numerous spells, such as ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[disrupt undead]]'', ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[mage armor]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[flaming sphere]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'', among many others. She considered ''[[magic missile]]'' and ''[[blindness]]'' to her favorite spells.\n\nHer talent with the arcane allowed Ghleanna to quickly develop and alter spells for further use. She did so with the ''invisibility'' spell, taught to her by [[Jarial]], creating ''[[greater invisibility]]'' spell variation.",
        "Possessions": "Ghleanna wore a hooded dark-green ''+3 [[cloak of resistance]]''. Her magic staff had properties of a ''[[rod of absorption]]'' and protected her from fire-based spells and effects. Additionally, her staff allowed her to cast fire spells that it absorbed within 24 hours.\n\nDuring her adventuring time in Myth Drannor, Ghleanna was armed with a staff. She also carried several ''[[potion of healing]]'' brewed using [[blueglow moss]]. In the ruins she acquired a pair of enchanted ''[[snakeskin boots]]'' that improved her defenses against [[poison]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Ghleanna's mother, [[Jesenalae Stormlake]], lost her own parents when she was a young maid. Shortly after that, she went to live with [[Adualacathus Stormlake]], Ghleanna's uncle, Jesenalae's brother, who was a stern and compassionless man. Adualacathus and his wife raised Ghleanna in a cruel and unloving home.\n\nGhleanna had a half-brother on her father's side - [[Athan]],\n\nGhleanna felt kinship towards [[Kestrel]], a fellow Veiled One and often the party's voice of reason. She and Kestrel both were orphans and often felt like they needed to stand  up fro each other. She was warm towards [[Durwyn]], thinking him to be a gentle giant. [[Corran D'Arcey]] was a paragon of goodness in Ghleanna's eyes second only to her half-brother.",
        "History": "Ghleanna Stormlake was born out of a brief romantic rendezvous between a [[human]] adventurer and an [[elf]] noblewoman. Once Jesenalae reached adolescence, she fled from home and her strict and unloving brother. Soon after, she ran across the man who was to become the father of her child. Jesenalae found Garth wounded in a hunting accident and helped the man to get to a secluded hunting cabin where she nursed him to health. During that time, Garth took advantage of the young and naive elven lass, seducing her and then returning to his wife and children. Devastated and with a child, Jesenalae returned to her brother's home, where the emotional abuse resumed. Jesenalae intended to flee once the child was born, knowing how much a half-breed child would infuriate her hard-hearted brother. However, that was not to be. Jesenalae Stormlake died in childbirth.\n\nWhen Ghleanna was born, Adualacathus Stormlake was planning on smothering the newborn to death, furious with the human-blooded offspring of his sister. Adualacathus's quiet wife saved the baby's life. She begged her husband to spare the child. The cruel noble agreed to let the \"half-breed spawn\" live if his wife was never to intercede for Ghleanna ever again.\n\nGhleanna Stormlake grew up lonely, unloved and shunned in Adualacathus's home. At an early age, she showed the gift for the Art but was disallowed to ever use it by her family. The young woman's will, just like her arcane energies, were locked, bubbling on the inside for years until one day, Ghleanna's human half-brother - Athan, tracked her down. Garth died not too long before that and confessed to his surviving family about Ghleanna's mother and how he left a pregnant woman behind. The young sorceress's brother turned out a good and honorable sort and spent time tracking his sister, hoping to fix his father's wrongdoing. Discovering the young woman and her talents, he offered her a meeting with a wizard friend of his, the offer Ghleanna took gladly. She left her family and never returned.\n\nThe half-brother's friend eventually mentioned Ghleanna to Elminster of Shadowdale who quickly took the young woman in under his wing, recognizing her blossoming arcane talents. Apprenticing under the Old Wizard, Ghleanna Stormlake learned to control her powers and channel them into the Art. With her magical talents being of sorcerous nature, Elminster could only teach her to handle the weave letting the woman develop her gifts without the aid of ''[[spellbook]]s'' and ''[[scroll]]''s."
