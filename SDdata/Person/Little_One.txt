'''Little One''' was an [[ogre]] scholar that lived and studied in [[Candlekeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a reticent individual, unlike others of his kind, who found a haven in the library-fortress after being shunned by the rest of "civilized society". He was well-liked by the [[Avowed|monks]] of Candlekeep and his intellectual pursuits were nurtured by their warmth and encouragement.

Little One regularly stayed at the [[Hearth]], the predominant festhall found in Candlekeep.

==History==
A few years before the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} the ogre later known as Little One was as savage as any other of his species. One day, he encountered a [[halfling]] in the possession of a [[gold]] ''[[headband of intellect]]'', whom he then killed without a second thought. The ogre recovered the [[magical item]], [[Attunement|attuned]] to it and placed it upon his own head.

After gaining a genius-level intellect offered by the headband, the ogre became remorseful over the murder he committed. He sought to learn as much as he could, to combat the ignorance and the violence that previously filled his life, and adopted the name "Little One". He chose that name to honor the slain halfling whose death spurred his new life as an intellectual.

==Possessions==
In addition to the headband that so dramatically altered his life, Little One owned a copy of ''[[The Sum of Theology]]'' written by [[Vetheera|Saint Vetheera]].
