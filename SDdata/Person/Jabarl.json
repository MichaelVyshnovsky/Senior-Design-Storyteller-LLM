If that didnt work, he resorted to brute force. Jabarl liked to take care of horses, however, which could calm his violent nature.\nJabarl had a criminal past but always managed to avoid getting caught for his crimes. With the Stone-Cold Reavers he tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold. However, Cryovain hadnt amassed any treasure yet."
