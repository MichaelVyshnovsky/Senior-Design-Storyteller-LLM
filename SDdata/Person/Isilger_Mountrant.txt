{{quote|''You are more [[Bane]]'s creature than mine. Go where you belong.|[[Mystra]] to '''Isilger Mountrant''', according to [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]]}}


'''Isilger Mountrant''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1221}} to {{yearlink|1274}}.

==Appearance==
He was limber, and darkly handsome.

==Personality==
He was openly arrogant, largely viewed as thin-skinned and sadistic, both for physical pain and for emotions.

==History==
Isilger Mountrant was recorded to have slipped into courts, revels, and other places where he did not belong, and to have slain the previous [[Magister]], therefore gaining the office, by transforming himself into a maiden to get close and then attack with spells.

As the Magister, he was best known for having created the first ''[[blast globes]]'', which later became widespread amongst the [[Zhentarim]]. Per [[Syluné]] of the [[Chosen of Mystra|Chosen]], [[Mystra]] told him, during ''[[Mystra's Choice]]'', "You are more [[Bane]]'s creature than mine. Go where you belong". He was also recorded to have been slain in a battle with a dozen archmages, prime amongst which was the next magister, [[Thornar Fleetmoor]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some folk believed that Mystra punished him for his wickedness by tearing away all knowledge of magic from his mind.
