Isilger Mountrant was the Magister from  to .
He was limber, and darkly handsome.
He was openly arrogant, largely viewed as thin-skinned and sadistic, both for physical pain and for emotions.
Isilger Mountrant was recorded to have slipped into courts, revels, and other places where he did not belong, and to have slain the previous Magister, therefore gaining the office, by transforming himself into a maiden to get close and then attack with spells.
As the Magister, he was best known for having created the first blast globes, which later became widespread amongst the Zhentarim. Per Sylun√© of the Chosen, Mystra told him, during Mystras Choice, "You are more Banes creature than mine. Go where you belong". He was also recorded to have been slain in a battle with a dozen archmages, prime amongst which was the next magister, Thornar Fleetmoor.
Some folk believed that Mystra punished him for his wickedness by tearing away all knowledge of magic from his mind.
