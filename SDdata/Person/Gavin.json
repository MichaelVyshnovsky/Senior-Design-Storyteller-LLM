        "mainbody": "Gavin was a smith from Cantrev Myrrdale who used to travel selling his wares. He was married to Shareen and had two little girls.\nGavin had a booming voice. He was a very large man with a flowing black beard combined with thick, curling hair of the same color. His smile, which made his eyes sparkle, revealed an array of chipped and broken teeth. His garments were heavy and serviceable, albeit worn and grimy. When first encountered by Tristan, his size was noted as comparable to a Firbolg.\nGavin used a great hammer with six feet long haft and a massive head of cold, black iron. Tristan noted its head could not have weighed less than fifty pounds but the giant blacksmith twirled it through the air with feathery ease.\nWhen coming back from a trip, Gavin found his house flattened and all his family dead after a raid by Grunnarch the Red and his army."
