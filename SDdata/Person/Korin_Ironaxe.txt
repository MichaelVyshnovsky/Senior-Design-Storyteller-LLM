}}'''Korin Ironaxe''' was the [[dwarf]] ruler of [[Illefarn]] in the 14{{th}} century  and 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
==History==
Korin was the elder of the younger brothers of the king of [[Illefarn]] [[Derval Ironeater]].
Circa [[1257 DR]] the king decided that their numbers were no longer sufficient to survive in those tunnels and ordered his clan to the surface where they integrated themselves into the populations of [[Daggerford]], [[Secomber]] and [[Waterdeep]]{{Cite web/Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle Excerpts: Adv 3}}

In [[1354 DR]], Korin Ironaxe, who always disagreed with Derval's decision to leave their home, took a force of 32 dwarves and [[gnome]]s to resume their ancestral duty after their youngest brother Derwin discovered an [[Altar of Imix|anvil]], believed to be an altar to [[Moradin]] (though it was actually dedicated to [[Imix]]) - taking it as a sign that Moradin wanted them to reclaim their home. When they arrived though, they discovered part of the tunnel complex had been occupied by [[orc]]s.

For three years, Korin and his troop fought the orcs, losing nearly a dozen of their number.

Adventurous militiamen from Daggerford helped Korin retake the tunnels from the orcs as well as a band of bandit [[necromancer]]s. They also stemmed the flow of polluted water coming out of the Laughing Hollow.

However, no more reinforcements from the clan went to aid Korin. Derval declared Korin and his followers ''beldarakin'' (treacherous creatures) Korin however, had declared himself King Korin Ironaxe of the Ironaxe clan, renaming his new realm '''Ironaxe Halls''' and still ruled in [[1485 DR]], despite being old and crazy.

==Personality==
In 1485 Korin was a withered old fool who believed that he ruled over a great empire. however he still had some lucid moments. Korin often spoke of not trusting the [[wild elves]] of the [[Misty Forest]].
