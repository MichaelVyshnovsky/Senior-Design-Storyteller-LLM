        "mainbody": "Marguel at Twilight was a somewhat well-known mercenary in the 14 century DR.\nIn his twilight years, the adventurer and mercenary named Skullcrusher of Phlan recalled his dealings with Marguel sometime after he left the employ of the Cadorna family in mid-14 century DR. Skullcrusher described Marguel as a man tough as mithral who held a lot of grudges. Marguel had a long memory and remembered all people who treated him unfairly. The interaction between Skullcrusher and Marguel at Twilight left the man from Phlan decapitated. The only part of his body Skullcrushers comrades were able to find was his head. It took them a month to find someone able to perform resurrection."
