        "mainbody": "'''Marguel at Twilight''' was a somewhat well-known mercenary in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In his twilight years, the adventurer and mercenary named [[Skullcrusher (Phlan)|Skullcrusher]] of [[Phlan]] recalled his dealings with Marguel sometime after he left the employ of the [[Cadorna]] family in mid-14{{th}} century DR. Skullcrusher described Marguel as a man tough as [[mithral]] who held a lot of grudges. Marguel had a long memory and remembered all people who treated him unfairly. The interaction between Skullcrusher and Marguel at Twilight left the man from Phlan decapitated. The only part of his body Skullcrusher's comrades were able to find was his head. It took them a month to find someone able to perform ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]''."
