'''Aluvauna Thornym''' was the founder and one of the leaders of the [[Guardians of the Weave]] in [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Aluvauna was just an adventuring [[wizard]] from [[Waterdeep]] until [[1371 DR]] when a [[Zhent]] [[shadow adept]] put her in great danger. Discovering the [[Shadow Weave]], Aluvauna was shocked and decided that she needed to do something to protect the [[Weave]]. So she founded the Guardians of the Weave with help from her allies and the blessing of the [[Church of Mystra]] in order to protect the Weave and oppose the Shadow Weave.

In time, wizards devoted to [[Mystra]] or [[Azuth]] and hailing from many places, even from far [[Halruaa]], joined her ranks. After a year, the faiths of [[Deneir]], [[Isis]], [[Savras]], [[Sel√ªne]], and the [[elf]] and [[gnome]] magic deities granted their support to her group. Finally, Aluvauna found herself leading a large network and soon she nominated a representative for each city.

By 1374 DR, Aluvauna's goal was to also attract devotees of [[Velsharoon]] and progressive [[Red Wizards of Thay]].
