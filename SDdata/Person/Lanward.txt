==History==
Following the [[Siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Lanward was stationed in the [[Tower District]],{{NWDistricts}} which was occupied by [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s. He was ordered to make sure no agents or sympathizers of Many-Arrows entered or left the district by the entrance near the [[Fallen Tower]] tavern. In practice, this meant preventing even [[half-orc]]s—like [[Johari]] who were long-time residents who wanted to help and adventurers recruited by Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] to serve the Guard—from entering the district for fear that they would join the cause of their orc cousins. While an accomplished half-orc adventurer recruit gave him pause for thought, Lanward tasked the adventurer with confirming that some Many-Arrows orcs were afflicted with [[spellscar]]s, he said to convince the other guardsmen.
