Kiyosu Kuroda was a samurai retainer of Korimori clan in Maeshi Province in 1360 DR.
Kuroda was sent to lead a patrol of bushi near Ito-jo in order to stop an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to took the Seven Swords to Uemon. He found and fought the adventurers but was defeated.
Kuroda was a honorable man, not wanting unnecessary victims. He cared for his men. In his current mission he only wanted to recover the relics, or harry and weaken the enemies.
