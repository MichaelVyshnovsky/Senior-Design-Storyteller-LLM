        "History": "In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Rond, [[Fennor (Icewind Dale)|Fennor]], and [[Gurt (Icewind Dale)|Gurt]] were in [[Targos]] loading supplies onto a [[dog]]-pulled [[sled]] when Fennor spotted the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] barbarian [[Holga Kilgore]] and, from her tribal markings mistook her for a member of the Reghedmen [[Tribe of the Elk]].<ref group=\"note\">The ''Honor Among Thieves'' novelization appears to mistake the Uthgardt Elk tribe of the [[Savage Frontier]] with the Reghedmen Tribe of the Elk of Icewind Dale. This article presumes it is Fennor who is mistaken, as he seems like the sort who would be. Coincidentally, Rond shares a name with a chief of the Uthgardt Elk tribe, suggesting they were intended to be the same. Rond knew Holga had been banished from her tribe from marrying a \"Southlander\", so Fennor said she should cover her markings to avoid angering the Tribe of the Elk. Soon, the gang were throwing mud and jeers at her, but Holga ignored them and left."
