        "mainbody": "'''Laskar Nesher''' was a Waterdhavian noble, patriarch of the [[Nesher]] family of [[Waterdeep]] from at least the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, to at least the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, and an owner of an illicit logging empire ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.\n{{quote|\"I know you think me a copper-coddling miser, a fool preoccupied with the flash of coins and unable to see true riches,\" said the man earnestly. His eyes were feverishly bright. \"I often think so, myself. But the reason for it all is that I'm trying to build a dynasty for you. Yes, I am a fool. In the process of amassing a fortune, I've made you despise anything you might inherit from me.\"|Laskar Nesher}}",
        "Description": "Laskar was fat and he wore his brown waistcoat tight, making him look like a bratwurst [[sausage]]. The ill-fitting outfits left his jowls red from chafing.",
        "Personality": "Laskar was shifty, opportunistic, and mistrustful. He would try and sneak a hidden [[dagger]] in when no weapons and [[magic]] were allowed.",
        "Possessions": "The nobleman built his sizable illicit logging empire over his lifetime, creating a name for himself and building a dynasty for his son while trying to inspire rebellious Noph to take over the business.",
        "Relationships": "Laskar Neshar was not married and preferred the company of slender female consorts half his age. The latest one was [[Stelar]].\n\nHis son [[Kastonoph Nesher|Kastonoph \"Noph\" Nesher]] felt dismissive and annoyed at his father for spending all of his time and attention on earning a fortune and building a dynasty for his heir. When Noph discovered his father was attempting to blackmail Eidola, Noph's annoyance grew into disgust with his father.",
        "History": "In [[1371 DR]]{{DDTS}}, on [[Eleint 17]] and [[Eleint 18|18]], Laskar Nesher, his young consort Stelar, and his son Noph were in attendance for the wedding ceremony between the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] and [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. Soon after arriving at the wedding, Noph gained [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s favor by giving up his father's hidden dagger.\n\nAt the event, Lord Nesher wanted to attempt a negotiation with the [[elf]] nobles of the [[High Forest]] over logging rights for his business empire. The second reason for the businessman's presence at the wedding was to blackmail Eidola of Neverwinter over her mysterious past.\n\nA month after the abduction, the majority of Waterdeep's inhabitants thought Piergeiron the Paladinson dead as his spirit was trapped inside a ''[[soul gem]]''. In the weeks that led to the Open Lord's funeral, Laskar Nesher was among ambitious nobles fighting for Piergeiron's position. Neshers stirred public opinion, gave numerous speeches, and even provided bleached [[oak]] panels, rails, and bosses for the [[Palace of Waterdeep]], \"out of love for the great Piergeiron.\" The the Nesher furniture was clumsily enchanted with ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance]]'' spell. The amateurish attempt amused Khelben Arunsun, and he decided to leave the ensorcelled wood be, instead, Blackstaff changed the magics into transferring back all things twisted with images and sounds of sinister plots and menace. Laskar and his consort Stelar were both present during the funeral ceremony. However, Laskar's grab for power was for naught with Piergeiron's recovery soon after."
