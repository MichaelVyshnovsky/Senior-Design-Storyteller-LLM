Emthreena Gulkryn was a priestess of Mielikki active in the High Forest in the 10 century DR.
She was combating the creeping evil of Hellgate Keep in the eastern High Forest when, in the , the legendary ranger Yornar the Tracker gave her the holy spellbook that would come to be known as Yornars Trail Companion.
Emthreena made good use of it for much of a season until Mielikki sent her dream visions telling her it was time to pass it on, and to give it to a passing ranger who seemed worthy. She duly did so, establishing the Rightful Cycle of the Companion changing hands from priest to ranger, ranger to priest. However, Emthreena also gain the understanding that a Mielikkian priest might be permitted to use the Companion a second time after passing it on, but only if the need was great.
