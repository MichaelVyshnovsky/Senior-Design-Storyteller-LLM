'''Georgio''' was the owner and proprietor of the [[Golden Goblet Inn]] in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Georgio was a generous, pleasant, and somewhat handsome man of dark complexion. He had black hair and dark skin.

==Relationships==
Georgio was familiar with the retired [[half-orc]] [[fighter]] [[Chester Hearth]] and his [[moorhound]], who occasionally visited the Goblet. Georgio also found it notable that the orc always paid with [[gem]]stones, rather than with [[coin]].

==History==
The town of Mossbridges began growing after [[The Three Women War]] in [[the Vast]]. A new inn opened in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Georgio's [[Golden Goblet Inn]] on the town's main street. It quickly became a local favorite. The owner himself could always be found filling drinks from behind the bar and happily entertaining guests at their tables with tales and spilling local rumors.
