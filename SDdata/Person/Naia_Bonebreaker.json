        "mainbody": "Naia Bonebreaker was the wife of butcher Durto Bonebreaker, who helped him and his sibling operate the Two Brothers Butchery in Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.\nNaia wore her dark brown hair braids and had sparkling green eyes. She stood  tall and weighed around .\nShe was a rather quiet and hardworking individual.\nNaia was proficient in fighting with handaxes. Because of her upbringing she also had some experience with mining, tracking things underground, and appraising objects.\nNaia typically dressed in green clothes that complemented her eyes.\nAt the Two Brothers Butchery, Naia was typically managing the storefront and dealing with most customers. Once a week, when her husband was not working at the Two Brothers Butchery, Naia would go with him to the local Dancing Bear Inn.\nNaia was born into a family of miners. Her later marriage to Durto made her long for the days of being underground, causing her to enjoy strolling the icehouse caverns of the butchery despite her sometimes being frightened within them."
