'''Harptos''' was a [[wizard]] and inventor

==Description==
Harptos was a quiet scholarly man, far from being any sort of leader. He was a short and slim individual with dark hair.

==History==
Harptos hailed from the fortress-keep of [[Kaalinth]], which housed a small city and was located off the coast of the [[Tethyr Peninsula]] and [[Velen]], though it had long disappeared by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
