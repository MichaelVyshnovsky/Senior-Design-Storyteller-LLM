Harptos was a wizard and inventor
Harptos was a quiet scholarly man, far from being any sort of leader. He was a short and slim individual with dark hair.
Harptos hailed from the fortress-keep of Kaalinth, which housed a small city and was located off the coast of the Tethyr Peninsula and Velen, though it had long disappeared by the 14 century DR.
