        "mainbody": "Glouroth was a mature adult Shadow dragon that resided in the Deep Wastes between the Lake of Shadows and Maerimydra. He made his lair in the Wailing Cliff, an odd place where the Plane of Shadow bled into the Material Plane.  \nEver slinking in the darkness of his lair, Glouroth generally cloaks himself in shadows to mask his appearance.\nBeneath a veneer of charm and serenity Glouroth is a being of roiling hatred and rage. When conversing with others the shadow dragon murmurs soothing platitudes in a hissing whisper, all the while consumed with thoughts of gore and death.\nIn his younger years Glouroth dallied with a group of Kir-lanans, even managing to father a daughter from them in the form of the Half-dragon, Phaikkul.\nIn 1372 DR, drow refugees from the beseiged city of Maerimydra called upon an ancient pact they had with the dragon to grant them safe passage past the Wailing Cliff.\nAlthough Glouroth lived with two groups of Kir-lanan, who both payed homage to him in certain ways, he took little notice of them beyond the offerings the occasionaly brought him.\nAs the lair of Glouroth resided upon the main route between the city of Maerimydra and the drow outpost of Szith Morcane, this meant that they had to come to a certain number of arrangements concerning their realtionship. This took the form of a pact which meant the drow could garner free passage from both the kir-lanans and Glouroth through the Wailing Cliff. In addition, priestesses of Lolth knew a further stipulation of the pact that meant they could speak a code word to the shadow dragon telling him \"I am a captive, please destroy my captors\".\n*City of the Spider Queen\nCategoryMature adult dragons\nCategoryShadow dragons\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Wailing Cliff\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryMales\nnxier53jaqjwwxxjulkyw3jf2u6ukso"
