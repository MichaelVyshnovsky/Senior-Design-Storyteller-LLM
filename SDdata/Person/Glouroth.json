He made his lair in the [[Wailing Cliff]], an odd place where the [[Plane of Shadow]] bled into the [[Material Plane]].",
        "Description": "Ever slinking in the darkness of his lair, Glouroth generally cloaks himself in shadows to mask his appearance.",
        "Personality": "Beneath a veneer of charm and serenity Glouroth is a being of roiling hatred and rage. When conversing with others the [[shadow dragon]] murmurs soothing platitudes in a hissing whisper, all the while consumed with thoughts of gore and death.",
        "History": "In his younger years Glouroth dallied with a group of [[Kir-lanan]]s, even managing to father a daughter from them in the form of the [[Half-dragon]], [[Phaikkul]].\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], [[drow]] refugees from the beseiged city of [[Maerimydra]] called upon an ancient pact they had with the [[dragon]] to grant them safe passage past the [[Wailing Cliff]].",
        "Relationships": {
            "Kir-lanan": "Although Glouroth lived with two groups of Kir-lanan, who both payed homage to him in certain ways, he took little notice of them beyond the offerings the occasionaly brought him.",
            "Drow": "As the lair of Glouroth resided upon the main route between the city of Maerimydra and the [[drow]] outpost of [[Szith Morcane]], this meant that they had to come to a certain number of arrangements concerning their realtionship. This took the form of a pact which meant the drow could garner free passage from both the kir-lanans and Glouroth through the Wailing Cliff. In addition, [[priestess]]es of [[Lolth]] knew a further stipulation of the pact that meant they could speak a code word to the shadow dragon telling him \"I am a captive, please destroy my captors\"."
