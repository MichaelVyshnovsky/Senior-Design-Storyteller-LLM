'''Garin''' was a [[deva]] in service to [[Tyr]] in [[1384 DR|1384]]â€“[[1385 DR]].

==History==
In 1384 DR, Garin was assigned by his friend and superior [[Micus]] to act as the jailor of [[Kaanyr Vhok]], who had infiltrated the [[House of the Triad]]. However, [[Aliisza]] and [[Tauran]] deceived Garin and freed Kaanyr, believing that they needed his help to capture the more dangerous [[Zasian Menz]], also an infiltrator. For this, Garin was questioned by his superiors.

When the [[Spellplague]] hit, Garin was one of the commanders of the [[celestial]] armies that tried to repel the evil outsiders that arrived in [[Celestia]].
