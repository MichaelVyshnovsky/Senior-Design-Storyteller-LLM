'''Zariel''' was an [[elf|elven]] High Priestess of [[Tymora]] from [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Zariel could often be found inside the [[Yawning Portal]], giving out ''[[bless]]ings'' to the brave adventurers entering the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]]. She also offered her divine magical services for the returning survivors of the expeditions in exchange for a donation to the [[Church of Tymora]]. She aided the lone hero sent into Undermountain by the [[Blackstaff]] and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to investigate the recent [[kobold]] activities and thefts that all originated from the upper levels of the dungeon.
