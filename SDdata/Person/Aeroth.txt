'''Aeroth''' was a leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] based out of [[Karthaut Lighthouse]], and the [[Wearer of Purple]] for his cell during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Spartan and taciturn, Aeroth was a steadfast believer in the Cult's teachings, and considered that the conversion of dragons into [[dracolich]]es would fulfill some great prophecy. He also viewed [[Reveilaein Brant]]'s transformation into a [[Kaemundar]] as auspicious, likely to reinvigorate the Cult, and lead them to further greatness.

==Relationships==
The [[green dragon]] [[dragon aging|wyrmling]] [[Eldrisithain]] was Aeroth's familiar.

==History==
Before becoming the leader of the cult's cell in [[Karthaut Lighthouse]], Aeroth was a member of a cell in [[Vaasa]] that was disrupted by a group of [[paladin]]s, causing him to flee, resurfacing at a later date in another cell, within [[Cormyr]]. After that cell failed because of divided loyalties, Aeroth joined with Reveilaein, becoming the Wearer of Purple for his new cell. The cell moved to the [[Dragon Coast]], where after capturing a lighthouse, they sought to tempt lesser dragons into becoming dracoliches. About a month after they began operations, [[Teziir]] may have sent [[adventurer]]s to check up on the lighthouse workers.

==Abilities==
Aeroth often prepared spells such as ''[[slay living]]'', ''[[bestow curse]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[vampiric touch]]'', ''[[blindness/deafness]]'', ''[[death knell]]'', ''[[ghoul touch]]'', ''[[scorching ray]]'', ''[[spectral hand]]'', ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[shield]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[touch of fatigue]]''. Of those, ''slay living'', ''animate dead'' and ''death knell'' he knew only because as a Wearer of Purple he had appropriated the ability to learn spells from the [[death domain]]. His spellbook also held ''[[permanency]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', ''[[continual flame]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[identify]]'', ''[[alarm]]'', and ''[[comprehend languages]]''.

He could both brew potions and craft miscellaneous magical trinkets. He had an elaborate focus on the school of [[necromancy]], though he wasn't a specialist wizard.

==Possessions==
Aeroth was in possession of a [[ring of protection]], a [[cloak of resistance]], a [[headband of intellect]], a wand of ''[[mirror image]]'', and a scroll of ''[[invisibility sphere]]''.
