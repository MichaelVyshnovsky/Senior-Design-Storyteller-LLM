Metwell Greenwood was a fisher from the Gulf of Lath turned cleric, active in the 14 century DR.
Metwell was born in a humble family of fishers on the Gulf of Lath of Lantan. He was a short man and the weakest of his family. As a child, Metwell spent his time hauling catch, gutting fish, and mopping the boats deck. By the age of eighteen, he grew disgusted with fish and decided to become a priest of the god of forests Silvanus. It was an act of teenage rebellion that led him to an adventuring career, far, far away from the much-maligned smell and slime of fish.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, Greenwood was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.
