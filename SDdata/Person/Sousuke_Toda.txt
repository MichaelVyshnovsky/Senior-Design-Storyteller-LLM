'''Sousuke Toda''' was a head of the [[Toda]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] during the 1600s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
Sousuke and his Toda clan had only recently settled in [[Aru]] when the [[shogun]] granted him the daimyate in [[1210 DR|Wa Year 1628 (1210 DR)]], following the dismissal of [[Arata Matsutomo]].

As daimyo of Aru Province, Sousuke led well and Aru enjoyed almost a decade of peace. He died in a hunting accident, and was succeeded by his young son [[Eiji Toda]].
