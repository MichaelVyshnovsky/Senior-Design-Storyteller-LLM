'''The Aeltagarr''' was a [[sun elf]] [[sorceress]] and seer of the city of [[Lothen of the Silver Spires]] in [[Siluvanede]] around the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]]. She was known to be kindly and possessing [[magic]] enough to rival [[Magister]]s,{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|34-35}} and she was revered as the most senior mage of the realm.

==Activities==
The Aeltagarr was consulted by people of all races, who came to Lothen—the only place where other races were accepted in Siluvanede—to get an audience with her.

==History==
In the [[224 DR|Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR]], the adventuress [[Myrjala]] claimed to be a good friend of the Aeltagarr and to have seen in her [[scrying]] pool{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|33,37}} However, the Aeltagarr had not recognized the mage responsible.<ref group="note">Since Myrjala is in disguise, and is a false identity herself, it is unclear if the meeting with the Aeltagarr is true or not, but the intention seems to be that it is. In a meeting at [[Morlin Castle]], Myrjala, in magical disguise as the Herald of [[Tavaray]] known as Huntinghorn, reported this information to Highlord [[Falaeve]] of Siluvanede, but "Falaeve" was slain and revealed to be [[Ubriien Orlyn]], Mage Royal of Athalantar, also in disguise and doubtless the mage responsible for the attacks.
