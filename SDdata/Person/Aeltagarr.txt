The Aeltagarr was a sun elf sorceress and seer of the city of Lothen of the Silver Spires in Siluvanede around the 3 century DR. She was known to be kindly and possessing magic enough to rival Magisters, and she was revered as the most senior mage of the realm.
The Aeltagarr was consulted by people of all races, who came to Lothen—the only place where other races were accepted in Siluvanede—to get an audience with her.
In the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR, the adventuress Myrjala claimed to be a good friend of the Aeltagarr and to have seen in her scrying pool However, the Aeltagarr had not recognized the mage responsible.Since Myrjala is in disguise, and is a false identity herself, it is unclear if the meeting with the Aeltagarr is true or not, but the intention seems to be that it is. In a meeting at Morlin Castle, Myrjala, in magical disguise as the Herald of Tavaray known as Huntinghorn, reported this information to Highlord Falaeve of Siluvanede, but "Falaeve" was slain and revealed to be Ubriien Orlyn, Mage Royal of Athalantar, also in disguise and doubtless the mage responsible for the attacks.
