}}'''Erelda''' was the second-in-command of battlemistress [[Rylla]] of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].

==History==
In [[1379 DR]], during an attack by [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers on the Promenade, Erelda remained to control the seals that trapped the god's avatar.
However, a large group of [[ooze]]s attacked Erelda and her Protectors and managed to break the seal, awakening the [[avatar]] of Ghaunadaur.
