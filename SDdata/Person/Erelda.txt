Erelda was the second-in-command of battlemistress Rylla of the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.
In 1379 DR, during an attack by Ghaunadaurs followers on the Promenade, Erelda remained to control the seals that trapped the gods avatar.
However, a large group of oozes attacked Erelda and her Protectors and managed to break the seal, awakening the avatar of Ghaunadaur.
