Almaestaddamir Auldcastle, commonly called Almaes, was an alchemist who lived in Ashabenford. He was known for crafting and selling such items as tanglefoot bags, smokepowder, sunrods, as well as various acids and antitoxins.
Almaes once offered to build a smokepowder-keg-throwing device to combat the drow for Haresk Malorn, but he politely (and likely wisely) declined the offer.
