'''Elanil Elassidil''' was a famous [[bard]] and the [[Heralds (local)|Herald]] of [[Elventree]], holding the office of "Moonsilver" in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She had a ready wit but a quick temper, and kept abreast of all goings-on in Elventree. Although reticent about speaking with strangers, she had a reputation for honesty.

Elanil was strong and confident in her abilities. She was not afraid to give her opinion on a subject, even when not asked. Usually, Elanil quickly gave historical details to support her opinions against those that did not back their opinions with similar evidence. She was able to calm all situations with a single song. Elanil had great diplomatic skill.

==History==
Elanil lived in Elventree and acted as a Herald for the area by 1367 DR.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], she was worried about numerous [[drow]] arriving on the surface and, with the help of [[Seranolla]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and [[Zern Xerkstil]], she hired an adventuring party to investigate the matter. From a drow prisoner she captured, Elanil discovered that the drow were fleeing [[Szith Morcane]] after a [[fire giant]] army from [[Maerimydra]] occupied the outpost. The adventurers' mission was to find and free the archmage [[Solom Ned'razak]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|10}} Later she hired an adventuring party to face her ancestor [[Meira Faerenduil]], now a [[ghost]], in a false battle while disguised as [[Netherese]] in order to give peace to her spirit.{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|7}}

The last experience fully convinced Elanil to support political change inside [[Hillsfar]]. After gaining support from Hillsfar's [[Hillsfar Rogues' Guild|Rogues' Guild]], she gathered at the village called [[the Stop]] an adventuring party and hired them to infiltrate the First Lord's [[Midsummer Masquerade]] ball in order to collect intelligence about the city's leaders.{{Cite adventurers league/Hillsfar Reclaimed|5-6}}

From that mission, Elanil learned of a trip by the First Lord to [[Yûlash]]. However, a patrol of [[Red Plumes]] led by [[Malkyn Grenefeld]] arrived at Elventree. Elanil escaped to the [[Plodding Plow]], in the Stop, hoping to find someone to trust and tell that vital information. She entrusted an adventuring party with the infiltration and escaped again.{{Cite adventurers league/Death on the Wall|9}}

Later, Elanil gathered in [[Sporedome]] as many factions as possible in order to plan an assault on Maerimydra to defeat the fire giants for good.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|9}}

==Relationships==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], she was also a member of the [[Harpers]] and acted as a diplomat for them.

She was a descendant of Meira Faerenduil, a knight of [[Myth Drannor]].{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|7}}
