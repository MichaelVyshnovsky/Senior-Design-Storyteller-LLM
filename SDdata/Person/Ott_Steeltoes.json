He first worked as a pirate, but later was offered a place in the Xanathars Thieves Guild. He quickly accepted, liking the prospect of more power and a less dangerous life.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the reorganization of the guild (and the secret change of the guild master) gave him more freedom in his thieving operations, which Ott greatly enjoyed. He became good friends with Ahmaergo and the two dwarves often drank together.\nAround 1492 DR Ott was the caretaker of Sylgar, the pet fish of the Xanathar."
