Doril Cire () was a member of the Cult of the Eternal Flame in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Doril hatched a subtle plot to destroy the city. He manipulated the mad artist Andrik Gos into infusing fire elemental power in his paintings. One of these paintings magically controlled Kata Brizik into making an arson attack. Afterward, Doril decided to hide Andrik in his shop to create a masterpiece that could summon an elemental blast that would destroy the city.
At last, however, an adventuring party hired to uncover the truth behind the arson managed to defeat Doril and stop Andrik.
