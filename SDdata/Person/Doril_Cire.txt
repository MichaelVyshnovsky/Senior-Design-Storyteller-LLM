==History==
Doril hatched a subtle plot to destroy the city. He manipulated the mad artist [[Andrik Gos]] into infusing fire elemental power in his paintings. One of these paintings magically controlled [[Kata Brizik]] into making an arson attack. Afterward, Doril decided to hide Andrik in his shop to create a masterpiece that could summon an elemental blast that would destroy the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Flames of Kythorn|5}}

At last, however, an adventuring party hired to uncover the truth behind the arson managed to defeat Doril and stop Andrik.
