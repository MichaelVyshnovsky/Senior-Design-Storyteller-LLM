'''Rethuld of Saerloon''' was a [[Sembia]]n merchant in [[Dalelands]].

==History==
Rethuld was originally from [[Saerloon]]. Fearing the chaos that the [[Time of Troubles]] had unleashed in his country, and advised by a disguised [[malaugrym]], he gathered some like-minded merchants and a mercenary escort and traveled to the [[Dalelands]] with the intent to seize a stronghold. Rethuld and his group met [[Storm Silverhand]], [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]] and the [[Rangers Three]] at the [[Standing Stone]]. Storm managed to convince Rethuld that he was deceived, but at this point the malaugrym killed the merchant from behind and escaped. Storm followed the  monster while Syluné made an agreement with the remaining merchants.
