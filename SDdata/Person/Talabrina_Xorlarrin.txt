'''Talabrina Xorlarrin''' was a daughter of the fifth [[Drow]] House of [[Menzoberranzan]], a [[specialty priestess]] of [[Lolth]], and a merchant, who operated in the area of [[Underdark]] underneath [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Talabrina had a very distinct and memorable face. She was a short woman, only {{SI|4'8|'"|long=yes}} tall, and weighted {{SI|88|lb|k|long=yes}}. She had very long white hair and bore insignia of [[House Xorlarrin]].

==Abilities==
As a powerful [[fighter]] and a specialty priest of the Spider Queen, Talabrina was a fearsome opponent who was a master of combat and had access to Lolth's [[divine]] magics. Her formidability was even more impressive considering the wide arsenal of magic items and contingencies Talabrina had at the ready.

As a drow and a powerful priest, she could use several abilities, such as ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[levitation]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', and ''[[magic missile]]'', as well as ''[[spell turning]]''. In addition to the spell-like abilities, she could channel Lolth's divine favor into priest spells, such as: ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[word of recall]]'', ''[[rock to mud]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[contingency]]'' and the ''[[improved fellblade]]'' spell through it.

==Possessions==
Talabrina worse [[enchanted]] drowen ''[[bracers of blinding strike]]'' and wielded an enchanted drowen ''+5'' [[short sword]], when she was not willing a spell-conjured ''[[fellblade]]''. Her [[armor]] of choice was a set of powerful ''+4'' drowen [[chain mail]]. Other deadly implements at Talabrina's disposal were a ''[[wand of acid bolts]]'', a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'', and a ''[[wand of frost]]''. Her Xorlarrin ''[[house insignia]]'' granted Talabrina a variety of spells that could be activated one at a time, including ''[[ironguard]]'', ''dispel magic'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[monster summoning VI]]''. She particularly liked to summon ''[[greater basilisk]]s'' with her ''house insignia'' and carried a set of magical [[gem]]stones that held trapped [[vrock]]s, ready to be unleashed at Talabrina's enemies.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Ravens Bluff]] in the [[Vast]] expanded its influence into the Underdark, establishing [[Ravens Deep]] near [[Old Sarbreen]].{{Cite polyhedron/147/Pillars of Ravens Bluff|23}} The adventurers and settlers spent their manpower and resources charting and exploring the subterranean world. During that time, the adventurers came across Talabrina Xorlarrin, who occupied one of the ''[[symbol of death]]-trapped'' tunnels of the [[The Passages of Man]], near the Deep. Talabrina was served by [[gnome]]s and their ''[[simulacrum]]s'', doing mercantile business with various Underdark communities from her shop, under the alias of Tilabaria, but had soured relationship with the two major drow cities under the Vast. In case of emergency, she had a ''contingency'' spell ready that would transport her back to Menzoberranzan in case her life was close to being forfeited.
