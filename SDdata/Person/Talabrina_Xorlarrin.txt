Talabrina Xorlarrin was a daughter of the fifth Drow House of Menzoberranzan, a specialty priestess of Lolth, and a merchant, who operated in the area of Underdark underneath the Vast in the late 14 century DR.
Talabrina had a very distinct and memorable face. She was a short woman, only  tall, and weighted . She had very long white hair and bore insignia of House Xorlarrin.
As a powerful fighter and a specialty priest of the Spider Queen, Talabrina was a fearsome opponent who was a master of combat and had access to Lolths divine magics. Her formidability was even more impressive considering the wide arsenal of magic items and contingencies Talabrina had at the ready.
As a drow and a powerful priest, she could use several abilities, such as dancing lights, faerie fire, darkness, levitation, know alignment, detect magic, clairvoyance, detect lie, suggestion, dispel magic, and magic missile, as well as spell turning. In addition to the spell-like abilities, she could channel Lolths divine favor into priest spells, such as holy word, word of recall, rock to mud, flame strike, stone shape, contingency and the improved fellblade spell through it.
Talabrina worse enchanted drowen bracers of blinding strike and wielded an enchanted drowen +5 short sword, when she was not willing a spell-conjured fellblade. Her armor of choice was a set of powerful +4 drowen chain mail. Other deadly implements at Talabrinas disposal were a wand of acid bolts, a wand of magic missiles, and a wand of frost. Her Xorlarrin house insignia granted Talabrina a variety of spells that could be activated one at a time, including ironguard, dispel magic, tongues, and monster summoning VI. She particularly liked to summon greater basilisks with her house insignia and carried a set of magical gemstones that held trapped vrocks, ready to be unleashed at Talabrinas enemies.
In the , Ravens Bluff in the Vast expanded its influence into the Underdark, establishing Ravens Deep near Old Sarbreen. The adventurers and settlers spent their manpower and resources charting and exploring the subterranean world. During that time, the adventurers came across Talabrina Xorlarrin, who occupied one of the symbol of death-trapped tunnels of the The Passages of Man, near the Deep. Talabrina was served by gnomes and their simulacrums, doing mercantile business with various Underdark communities from her shop, under the alias of Tilabaria, but had soured relationship with the two major drow cities under the Vast. In case of emergency, she had a contingency spell ready that would transport her back to Menzoberranzan in case her life was close to being forfeited.
