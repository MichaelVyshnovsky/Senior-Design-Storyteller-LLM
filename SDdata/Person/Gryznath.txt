Gryznath was an adult black dragon and a Chosen of Faluzure who lived in the High Moor near the theocracy of Elturgard, around 1480 DR.Although there is not an exact date given, this adventure takes place six months after the start of a 4-edition campaign (Shieldmeet of 1479 DR).
Gryznath was highly intelligent for a black dragon, but he was also vainglorious.
Gryznath laired in the ruins of an old keep whose history was lost to time,
Around 1480 DR, Gryznath was sent by his god to take control of an orc horde and to topple the theocracy of Elturgard. Gryznath took the chance to try to convert his orc army to the worship of Faluzure. 
During his first attacks on Elturel, Gryznath killed the Tormite paladin Sir Tavil Soarvaren, and reanimated him as an undead to take control of Loyaltys Sacrifice, a holy artifact of Torm.
Eventually, the leaders of the Knights of Fury sent a group of adventurers to deal with the dragon. Although the adventurers claimed to have killed him, the paladins later investigated Gryznaths lair and didnt find his corpse. Some theorized that the corpse was either retrieved by a third party for unknown purposes, or that Gryznath was resurrected as an undead by his god, Faluzure.
