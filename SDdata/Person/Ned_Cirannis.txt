==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ned'Cirannis was initiated to the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]]. He became part of the [[goblin]] and drow army under the command of [[Minthara Baenre]] that targeted the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. He was scouting the grove but was caught off guard and killed by a [[druid]] in the form of a [[bear]]. Subsequently, his body was taken to Archdruid [[Halsin]] and [[Nettie]]'s story to be dissected. In the process, the druid discovered that Ned'Cirannis was infected by a [[mind flayer]] tadpole.
