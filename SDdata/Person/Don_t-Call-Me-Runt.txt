==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Runt was tasked with standing guard at the secret entrance into Baldur's Gate's [[Undercellar]], where the Guild's Guildhall was hidden. Whilst a [[half-orc]]ish enforcer [[Tusgront]] manned the main entrance, Don't-Call-Me-Runt was ready to dispatch any unwanted guest from a distance.
