'''Parda''' was a [[human]] [[monk]] and a tutor who dwelt within the library citadel of [[Candlekeep]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By {{Yearlink|1368}}, Parda was friends with [[Gorion]]'s ward, [[Abdel Adrian]]. Parda was an older man, often draped in yellow robes, who offered kindly advice and cared about the well being of Abdel. After Gorion's ward was attacked by [[Shank]], an assassin sent by [[Sarevok Anchev]], Parda advised the man to get his bearing together and leave Candlekeep as soon as possible, as per Gorion's wishes.
