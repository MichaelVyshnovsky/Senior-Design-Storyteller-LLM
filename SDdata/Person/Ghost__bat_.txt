Ghost was an albino bat in the Vast in the mid-14 century DR.
One day this bat was captured by a farmer, who believed its albinism would make it rather valuable. He brought it home to his wife, who was quite frightened by the creature and injured its wing.
The farmer later brought the bat to Marigolds Menagerie, whose owner Marigold Mufflefoot fixed its wing and paid the farmer 4 gold pieces for ownership over the creature.
