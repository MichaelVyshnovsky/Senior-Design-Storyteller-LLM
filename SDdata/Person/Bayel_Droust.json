        "mainbody": "'''Bayel Droust''' was a scholar and scribe from [[Impiltur]].  He was sent by the Grand Council in [[1399 DR]] on an expedition to map the post-[[spellplague]] coastline of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].  The ship he was travelling on, the [[Grayling]], was attacked and sunk by [[Cealynna]] near the island of [[Prespur]].  Bayel possessed two books written by the [[Shou]] [[monk]] [[Liou Chang]] that described how to open teleporation gates.  Cealynna wanted the [[spell]]s so she could return to the [[Feywild]] so she imprisoned Bayel in her undersea domain for eighty years where he was forced to work at breaking the code used by Liou Chang.  Bayel was rescued by the monk [[Kwan Shang-Li]] in [[1479 DR]].",
