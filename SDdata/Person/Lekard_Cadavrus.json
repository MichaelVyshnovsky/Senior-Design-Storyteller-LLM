        "History": "Six months before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}{{BG-DiA-time}}, Dead-Eye and his fellow pirates took control of the ''Uncivil Serpent'' away from its captain, [[Murosko Sessprin]].\n\nSome time later, Dead-Eye and his pirate crew were robbed by one of their own, [[Tarina|Rhonda Thunderbell]]. They tracked her to [[Baldur's Gate]] and sailed to the city in pursuit of revenge."
