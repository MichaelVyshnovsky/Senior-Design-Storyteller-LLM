'''Sakrattars Irithyl''' was second [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]] from {{Yearlink|-2900}} to {{Yearlink|-1950}}, the youngest great-grandson of [[Kahvoerm Irithyl]], first Coronal. He became the ruler of the empire after his father's death and the unsuccessful blade draw of [[Divisav Irithyl]], Kahvoerm's first son. His reign ended with his death as he sacrificed himself to create a blood dragon that slew a horde of [[drow]] that had occupied the former realm of [[Uvaeren]] and the [[Twisted Tower]].

Sakrattars' rysar was plagued with the rising of the Twisted Tower in {{Yearlink|-2549}} despite repeated attacks on it by the Coronal's forces. He also lived to see the infamous Spiderfires, which burned acres and acres of woods and separated [[Rystall Wood]] from the main body of [[Cormanthor]].
