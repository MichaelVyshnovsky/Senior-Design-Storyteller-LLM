        "mainbody": "Adalwulf Longfang was the honorable chieftain of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe located primarily in the Cold Wood.\nUnder Adalwulfs rule, the Red Tigers were strictly a wild and solitary tribe. Adalwulfs goal in life was teaching his son Shinoras how to rule with honor. Over the years, he felt the cold touch of age and the feelings of being a burden on the tribe, but Shinoras refused to become chieftain of the tribe until his father passed away.\nLongfang married Shala Longfangwife and had one son Shinoras.\nIn 1368 DR, all Adalwulfs dreams vanished with the death of Shinoras. His nephew, Thradulf Longfang became his heir and took the role of making decisions for the tribe."
