        "Personality": "Under Adalwulf's rule, the Red Tigers were strictly a wild and solitary tribe. Adalwulf's goal in life was teaching his son [[Shinoras]] how to rule with honor. Over the years, he felt the cold touch of age and the feelings of being a burden on the tribe, but Shinoras refused to become chieftain of the tribe until his father passed away.",
        "Relationships": "Longfang married [[Shala Longfangwife]] and had one son Shinoras.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], all Adalwulf's dreams vanished with the death of Shinoras. His nephew, [[Thradulf Longfang]] became his heir and took the role of making decisions for the tribe."
