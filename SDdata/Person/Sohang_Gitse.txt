'''Sohang Gitse''' was a gambler and a [[yakuza]] in [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], at the [[komite]] in [[Suijeng]], Sohang Gitse took bets on any and all contests in the tournament. Although technically a criminal, he was scrupulously honest about the gambling he managed. Sohang had a vast network of informants to help him set odds for each fight. He had gathered a great deal information on specific fighters, judges, and the tournament in general, which he would share with anyone for a price.
