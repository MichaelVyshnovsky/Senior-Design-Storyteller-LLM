'''Tharm Thamzid''' was a [[dwarf]] who served as the cook of [[Castle Naerytar]] for the Black Dragon Wyrmspeaker [[Rezmir]] of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Severin Silrajin]].

He complained bitterly about the castle's lack of ingredients for good meals. The [[lizardfolk]] gathered food for him, and their notion of edible vs not edible did not align with Tharmzid's own views.
