Tharm Thamzid was a dwarf who served as the cook of Castle Naerytar for the Black Dragon Wyrmspeaker Rezmir of the reformed Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin.
He complained bitterly about the castles lack of ingredients for good meals. The lizardfolk gathered food for him, and their notion of edible vs not edible did not align with Tharmzids own views.
