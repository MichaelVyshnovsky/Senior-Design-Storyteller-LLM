'''White Maw''' was a massive intelligent  [[gray ooze]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==History==
White Maw was the result of one of the experiments of the [[transmuter]] [[Sarkalla]] to create a sentient ooze beside the [[Ooze Master]]. 

In 1486 DR, it was destroyed by the heroes of [[Daggerford]].

==Personality==
White Maw absorbed the identities of the creatures it ingested. This granted it sentience, but with a price; the conflicting personalities of those it consumed drove it to madness. 

==Powers==
It could communicate telepathically and was quite intelligent but also deeply insane. It was linked to the Ooze Master.
