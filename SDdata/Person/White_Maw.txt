White Maw was a massive intelligent  gray ooze in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
White Maw was the result of one of the experiments of the transmuter Sarkalla to create a sentient ooze beside the Ooze Master. 
In 1486 DR, it was destroyed by the heroes of Daggerford.
White Maw absorbed the identities of the creatures it ingested. This granted it sentience, but with a price the conflicting personalities of those it consumed drove it to madness. 
It could communicate telepathically and was quite intelligent but also deeply insane. It was linked to the Ooze Master.
