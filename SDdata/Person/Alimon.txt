Alimon was a Netherese arcanist, mentalist, and teacher.
Alimon founded his own educational institution, Alimons Mental Academy, which was located in Seventon. Here, he taught the field of mentalism to several students.
Though not much was known about Alimon, he was known to live during the Golden Age of Netheril. He allowed the young arcanist Enollar to join his academy at the age of eighteen. Enollar quickly became Alimons best student, and after some time, Enollar left to travel to the enclaves of Netheril.
