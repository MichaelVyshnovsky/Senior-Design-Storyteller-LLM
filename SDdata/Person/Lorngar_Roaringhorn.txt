'''Lorngar Roaringhorn''' was a member of the [[Roaringhorn]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]] in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lorngar Roaringhorn once fought a spontaneous duel with [[Kelvar Helmfast]] in the Great Library of the [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in the late 1330s DR. They did substantial damage to the library, for which their respective families made reparations at many times the cost of the damage.<ref group="note">The text of ''Powers & Pantheons'' discusses the prohibition of magic in the library, followed by talk of past duels, implying they were fought with magic. Since Kelvar is a fighter, it seems likely that Lorngar is a spellcaster.
