        "mainbody": "'''Dravo Flymm''' was a merchant and cobbler who, alongside his wife, [[Sally Flymm]], ran [[Flymm's Cobblers]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sally was also the mother of the infamous [[Lord Gortash]], one of the leaders of the [[Cult of the Absolute]].\n\n{{Quote|We had debts. World-ending debts, trying to keep this cursed shop afloat. Dangerous lenders who said they'd bury us all if we didn't pay.|Sally Flymm's thoughts.}}",
        "Description": "Dravo was a [[human]] man who, in the late 15{{th}} century DR, was aged. He had a light and pale skin tone and icy blue eyes. He had jet-black hair and a bushy black mustache.",
        "Possessions": "Sally and Dravo's shop was located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, near [[Beehive Goods and Wares]].",
        "History": "Sally and Dravo were poor cobblers who struggled to meet their ends while running the cobbling business. At some point, the married couple ran into serious debt, owing money to multiple parties, including some vicious loan sharks who threatened to torch the store. The pressure put a strain on their relationship as well as on their son. Out of desperation, the Flymms sold their young son Enver's services to a [[Raphael|warlock]], earning a hefty sum that secured the shop and their couple's safety. Despite a cruel and desperate acct, Sally believed that they did what was best for Enver and the parents. The boy was smart, too smart, according to Sally, so the mother was at peace with the difficult decision to give Enver up and all three surviving versus all three being murdered by the loan sharks.\n\nYears later, Enver Flymm, now using the name of Enver Gortash, became a warlock in his own right and made a fortune by smuggling weapons. His ambition led Enver to become one of the three leaders of the Cult of the Absolute, assembling an army of brainwashed servants, many of whom were infected with altered [[mind flayer]] tadpoles. While unsavory activities were hidden, Enver rose in prominence in Baldur's Gate, becoming a lord. Still bitter over his parents' actions, Gortash stormed into Flymm's Cobblers like a fist of justice and infected his parents with mind-altering parasites. These tadpoles, however, were different; instead of brainwashing them, the creatures dominated the Flymms. Sally was happy and eager, running the business and praising her beloved son for becoming a Lord, all while her true self was locked inside her mind, unable to do much but watch her body being puppeteered by the parasite. Sally's husband, Dravo, is faced with an even darker fate. The parasite completely destroyed his mind, leaving nothing but a smiling puppet behind. By the time the Cult of the Absolute's army attacked the Gate, Sally and Dravo had been controlled by the parasites for several months. It was unknown if the two survived the ensuing battle for the city."
