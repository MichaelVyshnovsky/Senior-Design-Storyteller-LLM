'''Thistlebrook''' was a [[green warder]] in [[Cormanthor]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In [[1221 DR]], an [[elf]]Â [[druid]] ordered Thistlebrook to watch over the ruined tower of [[Talarith]] near the [[Moonsea]] area. It fulfilled its task well until 1373 DR, when the place was invaded by a [[drow]] party led by [[Varzek]]. It had no power to destroy them so it lurked around the area, hoping to find some allies to expel them.
