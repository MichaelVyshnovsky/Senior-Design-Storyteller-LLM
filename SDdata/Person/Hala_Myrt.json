        "mainbody": "'''Hala Myrt''' was a [[Tethyrian]] [[human]] who frequented the [[Grinning Lion]] tavern in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]], working for [[Orlpar Husteem]].<ref group=\"note\">Originally described as male fighter in ''[[Volo's Guide to Waterdeep]]'', later sources ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'' and [[Dungeon magazine 126|''Dungeon'' #126]] apparently retcon her as a female commoner. Without more information, this article chooses the literal interpretation. Possible explanations include a disguise, a curse, a sex change, a gender transition, or she was given the same name as her father and took over his occupation. She found customers for Orlpar and set up meetings. She was arrested by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] on many occasions but was never charged due to the actions of Orlpar's agents, who were responsible for watching her movements while she was carrying Orlpar's money or illegal substances. Hala consumed [[dreammist]], a highly addictive drug, on a regular basis.",
        "Description": "In 1372 DR, Hala looked older than her thirty years, with sunken eyes, flat brown hair, and aged skin. She usually wore a stained and threadbare brown frock. She spoke with a soft voice, her smile was usually strained, and she giggled for no discernible reason. In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, she was a fixture in the Grinning Lion, usually sitting on a bar stool in her guise as a grumpy, overweight, male ne'er-do-well.",
        "Activities": "Hala acted as a go-between and delivery person for Lord Orlpar. She was constantly watched by other agents in Orlpar's employ whenever she was in possession of drugs or money that belonged to him. It was well-known that she was under protection and nobody bothered her except the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]]. Whenever she was detained, her protectors stepped in to provide alibis and bail.",
        "History": "Hala acted as an agent for Lord Orlpar since at least the {{YearlinkName|1357}}."
