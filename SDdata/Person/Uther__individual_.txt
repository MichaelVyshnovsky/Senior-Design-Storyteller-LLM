'''Uther''' was the butler of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] in [[Suzail]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

Thanks to an irreversible spell cast by [[Danilo Thann]], Uther looked like an [[Abyss]]al denizen. The [[Thann]] family payed him a large amount of money for the damage. Secretly, Uther liked his new look, because it attracted some of the more adventurous female members of the circle and made it easy for him stop a brawl with a single look.
