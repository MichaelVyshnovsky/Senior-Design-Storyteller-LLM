Marquox was a mind flayer prisoner of the githyanki in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR Marquoxs fellow mind flayers Telzact and Yeluit went inside the Crystal Labyrinth level and disappeared. Marquox followed them in but was captured by the githyanki and, very unusually for them, kept alive inside a cell.
Marquox was a member of the illithid colony inside the Seadeeps Level with a good relationship with Telzact and Yeluit.
