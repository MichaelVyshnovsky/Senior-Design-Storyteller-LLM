Though in his mid-40s, his lean frame made him appear much younger.\nKhafaz was a devious man. He often blamed others for misfortunes.\nHis basic equipment included leather armor, a dagger, some darts, and a short sword. Khafaz owned a valuable brooch shaped like a camels head and two silver bracelets. He also carried a flask that had two doses of a potion of healing.\nKhafaz learned his skills as a teenager on the streets of Tajar. He eventually saved enough money to purchase ships to carry goods to Huzuz and send caravans across the High Desert. He was very knowledgeable with the geography of the High Desert."
