'''Ehamond''' was a member of the [[Tomb Guard]] that protected the resting places of [[Evereska]]n [[elves]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was very closed with his fellow tomb guard [[Takari Moonsnow]] and the pair were well in-tuned with each other while carrying out their duties.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Ehamond and the other tomb guards serving under [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] stumbled into the domain of a [[phaerimm]] behind the [[Sharn Wall]] far underground beneath the [[Greypeak Mountains]]. During that encounter he was held for a time by the strange beast, but eventually freed by his commander Galaeron and Takari. 

Ehamond took care of Takari as they group traveled back to Evereska, taking her to High Huntsman [[Pleufan Trueshot]] and the healing waters of the [[Hall of the High Hunt]].

After all was said and done, Ehamond was assigned to a different patrol leader of the Tomb Guard.
