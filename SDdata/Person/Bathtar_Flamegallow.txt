Bathtar Flamegallow was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR.
Per Narnra Shalace, then a spy, he was jovial and could amuse with his jokes.
Narnra described him as trim-bearded.
He liked to spend time at The Downed Falcon, a tavern. Narnra Shalace determined he had little interest in other than making toy ships float.
In , the Waterdhavian thief Narnra Shalaces first assignment as a spy for the Royal Magician of Cormyr, Caladnei, was to eavesdrop on a number of the War Wizards, including Bathtar Flamegallow. During her investigation, she found him at least once in the bathroom.
