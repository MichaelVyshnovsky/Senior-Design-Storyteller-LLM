We are the laughing stock of [[Faerûn]] when we should be the most feared. I hate this game-playing. We should embrace our past and the honest ways… killing, war, and occupation. Instead we hawk magical wares like street vendors.''|Naglatha, the Chief of Foreign Activities of Thay}}",
        "Description": "Naglatha was a young, black-haired woman with a grim face.",
        "Personality": "Naglatha quickly rose through the ranks of the Red Wizards thanks to her fanatical zeal and ruthlessness. However, she was loyally devoted to the god [[Azuth]].",
        "Activities": "Naglatha kept her devotion to [[Thay]] a secret from her associates in Selgaunt. She masqueraded as a merchant with a store that traded in magical items and curios from the South. Her shop was located on [[Larwaken Lane]].",
        "History": "Naglatha arrived in [[Selgaunt]] early in 1357 DR with a very deep cover; even [[Alzegund]] was unaware of her identity as a Red Wizard of [[Thay]]. Everyone in the [[Dragon Reach]] area thought she was only a merchant with a preference for extravagant tools from [[south Faerûn]]. In truth, using the alias \"the Black Flame\", she was recruiting valorous men to Thay's cause. She always used a black mask in her mission in order to disguise her identity. Once a year she went \"to the South\" for three months, in truth traveling to Thay to receive new instructions.\n\nLater she rose through the ranks thanks to the \"accidental\" death of [[Alzegund]] in [[1364 DR]]. In [[1373 DR]], she was involved in a plot by the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]] against [[Szass Tam]], but the plan backfired thanks to the intervention of [[Thazienne Uskevren]] and Tam promised his vengeance against her."
