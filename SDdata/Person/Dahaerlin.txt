''' Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Lathander]] and a champion of the [[Brotherhood of Light]] during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}

==History==
After the village of [[Hespheira]] was transported away from the base of [[Mount Sar]] to the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the {{yearlinkName|1024}}, Dahaerlin took action. He commissioned the creation of the powerful ''[[rod of Lathander]]'' from the clergy at the [[Spires of the Morning]], and led the Brotherhood in a campaign to rescue the missing villagers.

The Lathanderite warriors traveled across the plane for four months until they encountered the [[dracolich]] [[Umbralax]] in the [[Darklands (Shadowfell)|Darklands]]. Together they fought a great battle against the shadowy beast and his minions, managing to save over half of Hespheira's captured people.

While the exact specifics are unknown, it was believe that Dahaerlin helped ensure the escape of both his comrades in battle and the people they rescued by sacrificing his own life. What was known however, was that he did not return with them back to [[Faerûn]].
