'''Dhafiyand''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] operating in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He concealed his true allegiance and managed to become the spymaster of the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, [[Dagult Neverember]].

==History==
Working with [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and fellow Red Wizard [[Tolivast]], he hatched a complex plot to use the [[Sons of Alagondar]] as cover for killing Dagult. In order to achieve this objective, in the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, Dhafiyand hired [[Rucas Sarfael]] and ordered him to infiltrate the Nashers through [[Elyne Tschavarz]]. In the end, however, Rucas discovered the deception in time and managed to save Dagult from Dhafiyand and his [[undead]] minions. In the fighting Dhafiyand was killed and so the [[Thay]]ans lost an irreplaceable agent and were unveiled as enemies of Neverwinter.
