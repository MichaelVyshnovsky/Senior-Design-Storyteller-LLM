        "mainbody": "Deltagar Zelhund was one of the Overwizards of the Arcane Brotherhood in the 1360s DR.\nCirca 1365 DR, Deltagar was growing a criminal network in southern countries like Lantan and Tashalar, and was planning to soon use his agents to fund all the Brotherhoods activities. He plotted to sack Chult and steal the best inventions from Lantan.\nIn 1371 DR, after Eldeluc and Valkebars coup against the Archmage Arcane, Arklem Greeth, Deltagar pledged his loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a lich and with some new devilish allies, Deltagar escaped to Hlondeth, where he was granted refuge. \nDeltagar was utterly fascinated by the yuan-ti. He was a master manipulator, disliking open hostility."
