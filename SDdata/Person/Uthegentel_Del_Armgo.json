Salvatore's]] novel ''[[Siege of Darkness]]'', his name is spelled ''Uthegental'', but in the [[Menzoberranzan (boxed set)|''Menzoberranzan'' boxed set]] his name is spelled ''Uthegentel''. was the [[drow]] house [[weapon master]] of [[Barrison Del'Armgo]].",
        "Description": "It was often said Uthegentel was the largest drow ever since he stood at over 6 ft (1.83 m) tall and weighed around 200 lb (90.72 kg). Uthegentel had short spiky white hair which was gelled with cooked [[rothe]] udders. Through his nose was a [[mithril]] ring and he had [[gold]] pins stuck through his cheeks. Most think Uthegental was never full blooded, because of his height and abnormally large build for a drow elf. Uthegental was a rival to [[Dantrag Baenre]], weapon master to [[House Baenre]] until his death at the hands of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. At this time, Uthegentel was considered the greatest drow warrior in all of [[Menzoberranzan]].",
        "Possessions": "His weapon of choice was a black ''[[trident|trident +5]]'' and he also used a magical ''[[net of entrapment]]''.",
        "Personality": "In battle, Uthegentel was wild and would wipe red and yellow [[dye]] on his face, which could be seen with or without [[darkvision]]. Seemingly immune to pain and most mortal wounds, he possessed incredible savagery and was often reckless and impulsive.",
        "History": {
            "Death": "During the assault on [[Mithral Hall]] in [[1358 DR]], Uthegentel singlehandedly defeated [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] and his entire [[Gutbuster Brigade]]. After killing one [[dwarven]] member, Uthegentel was killed by a bite to the neck from [[Bidderdoo Harpell]]."
