        "mainbody": "Uthegentel DelArmgoIn R.A. Salvatores novel Siege of Darkness, his name is spelled Uthegental, but in the Menzoberranzan boxed set his name is spelled Uthegentel. was the drow house weapon master of Barrison DelArmgo. \nIt was often said Uthegentel was the largest drow ever since he stood at over 6 ft (1.83 m) tall and weighed around 200 lb (90.72 kg). Uthegentel had short spiky white hair which was gelled with cooked rothe udders. Through his nose was a mithril ring and he had gold pins stuck through his cheeks. Most think Uthegental was never full blooded, because of his height and abnormally large build for a drow elf. Uthegental was a rival to Dantrag Baenre, weapon master to House Baenre until his death at the hands of Drizzt DoUrden. At this time, Uthegentel was considered the greatest drow warrior in all of Menzoberranzan.\nHis weapon of choice was a black trident +5 and he also used a magical net of entrapment.\nIn battle, Uthegentel was wild and would wipe red and yellow dye on his face, which could be seen with or without darkvision. Seemingly immune to pain and most mortal wounds, he possessed incredible savagery and was often reckless and impulsive.\nOn Matron Baenres campaign to Mithral Hall, he foolishly ventured into the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone alone to find it temporarily abandoned. \nDuring the assault on Mithral Hall in 1358 DR, Uthegentel singlehandedly defeated Thibbledorf Pwent and his entire Gutbuster Brigade. After killing one dwarven member, Uthegentel was killed by a bite to the neck from Bidderdoo Harpell."
