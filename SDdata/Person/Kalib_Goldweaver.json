        "mainbody": "'''Kalib Goldweaver''' was a [[dwarvish]] [[priest]] of [[Muamman Duathal]] from the Living City, [[Ravens Bluff]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I have chosen you to be my voice in this land, my son. Through your actions of bravery and strength I will help you aid the traveler in need. Through your passion of faith and hope I will aid you in finding the expatriate a home. Through your patience and trust I will aid you in helping our dwarven brothers when they must travel far from their hearths and kin.''|Muamman Duathal to Kalib Goldweaver}}",
        "Description": "Kalib was a stout fellow of {{SI|4'6|'\"|long=yes}} and weighed {{SI|185|lb|k|long=yes}}. He had black and silver hair and [[aquamarine]]-colored eyes.",
        "Abilities": "As both a [[fighter]] and a [[Trailblazer]] of Muamman Duathal, the dwarf was well-trained in the use of [[mace]]s, [[battle axe]]s, [[katana]]s, [[wakazashi]], [[spear]]s, [[long sword]]s and [[short sword]]s. He knew how to read and write in [[Common]] and [[Dwarvish]] languages, and was knowledgeable in healing, spellcraft, herbalism, and mountaineering. Additionally, he was proficient in naval skills such as seamanship, navigation, [[rope]] use, and swimming. Kalib was also a good singer.",
        "Possessions": "As a priest, Kalib Goldweaver carried a ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Muamman Duathal and five vials of ''[[holy water]]''. He was adorned in a set of dwarven [[plate mail]]. His backpack was filled with such mundane equipment as a [[waterskin]], flint and steel, a [[tinder box]], a [[whetstone]], [[chalk]], [[silk]] rope, [[quill]]s, [[ink]], a warm winter blanket, a large pouch of beads, and a small handy [[mirror]]. Kalib wore a [[blue pearl]] earring.\n\nHe also owned a variety of [[enchanted]] items. He wore ''[[boots of striding and springing]]'', a ''[[cloak of the bat]]'', ''[[bracers of quickness]]'', and ''[[gauntlets of ogrillion strength]]''. His magical jewelry included a ''[[pearl of the sirines]]'', a ''+3 [[ring of protection]]'', and a ''[[ring of sustenance]]''. The dwarf's collection of magic weapons consisted of a magic ''+3'' short sword, a ''+2'' [[small shield]], a ''[[longsword of the planes]]'', and two of ''[[Wendraz's wondrous weapon]]s''.",
        "History": "Kalib hailed from the [[Orsraun Mountains]] in [[Turmish]], born into a dwarvish mining clan. His father was a traditionalist and left little option for his son, insisting on Kalib becoming a miner too. It was not to be. Still young and rebellious, Kalib Goldweaver followed his dream of sailing the seas. After thirty-nine years spent with his clan in the Orsraun Mountains, Kalib found the courage to disobey his father's will. The aquamarine-eyed dwarf left on bad terms, and not a single member of the clan nor his family wished him well on the upcoming journey.\n\nHe found his destiny in a small port town in the [[Vilhon Reach]], where he took his first swim in the waters of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. That memory would be held dear by the aged dwarf. At the port, Kalib sought for a ship or a boat to work aboard of. That time was a struggle for the young man, and he faced much coldness and cruelty from other sentient species of the region. None took the dwarf's dream of the sea seriously. Eventually, he found a job as a cabin boy aboard a [[galleon]] called ''[[The Wanderer]]''.\n\nKalib Goldweaver's time on ''The Wanderer'' brought yet more challenges. The galleon's captain was a cruel man who was delighted to assign all the most deadly and dangerous jobs to the strange dwarf. Kalib never complained and completed every single task with pride. He especially found joy in cleaning off branches from the ship's hull while hanging upside down as the vessel moved through the waves. Kalib spent seven years aboard ''The Wanderer'' yet made little friends. In the seventh year, he faced his first pirate attack. Many of his co-workers were butchered in the attack. Kalib fell to his knees and prayed to any dwarvish god who would hear his plea in terror. The dwarf prayed for courage, and Muamman Duathal answered. Empowered by the prayer, Kalib charged to save the surviving sailors. He rushed through a pirate [[mage]]'s ''[[web]]'' [[spell]]s unrestrained and eventually saved the day.\n\nAfter the battle, Muamman Duathal appeared to Kalib Goldweaver in a bolt of lightning. The deity tasked Kalib with aiding travelers in need and promised to help the dwarf to find his true home. The [[avatar]] presented him with a ''holy symbol'' of Muamman Duathal and a handful of beads, one for each pirate slain by the dwarf, dipped in their blood. The deity commanded Kalib to braid them into his beard and to add a bead for each life he would take in the future. This penance was to serve as a way to save souls lost to corruption and evil. Each bead would compile the souls to follow Kalib into the afterlife once his time came to leave.\n\nWith the cruel captain's death in the raid, sailors proclaimed Kalib Goldweaver the new captain of ''The Wanderer''. The dwarf was wise to know he did not have enough experience to command such a vehicle and assigned a temporary captain to take the helm until he was ready. Subsequently, Kalib left the ''The Wanderer'' in the port of Ravens Bluff, guided by rumors that dwarves once ruled it a century prior. He decided to practice his priestly duties serving the numerous adventurers who operated from the City of Ravens. He adventured alongside others, made many friends, and gained renown through many feats and slayings of [[drow]], [[dragon]]s, and [[demon]]s. When he grew in power and acclaim, Kalib Goldweaver was ready to claim the title of the captain of ''The Wanderer''.\n\nOne adventure of note took place in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.{{LCRB}} It included Kalib Goldweaver and several other adventurers being sent back in time to retrieve a certain [[book]] from a dwarven [[Brightsword Clan]]. Kalib was inspired by the clan's unity and bravery in the face of certain looming death at the hands of an invading drow army. Kalib Goldweaver swore to see the Clan Brightsword shine again after their return to his time. For the next year and more, Kalib worked tirelessly in restoring the dwarven clan's good name and restoring its glory, following a rescue of some of the clan's children and females using time magics. During that year, Kalib met another dwarf who shared his goals â€“ [[Uldred Deepaxe]], and the two soon became close friends, bonding over the Clan Brightsword.\n\nBy [[Alturiak]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Uldred was made a Thane of the temple complex at [[Brightsword Keep]], and Kalib was named his loyal advisor and the Chief Prelate.\n\nIn or shortly before [[Uktar]]-[[Nightal]] of 1371 DR, a wedding took place in the Brightsword Keep, officiated by Kalib Goldweaver. Uldred Deepaxe wed [[Cherrian Waraxe]], one of the Brightsword Clan's women rescued from the past a year prior. The wedding was reported on by [[Fred Faber]], the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'s'' editor-in-chief.{{Cite trumpeter/2-11/A Royal Wedding|1}}"
