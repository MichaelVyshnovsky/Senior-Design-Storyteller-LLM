'''Aisha al-Jazarijja''' was a member of the [[House of Hanif]] tribe within the [[Haunted Lands]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Aisha, along with her sister [[Dalida al-Jazarijja|Dalida]], was kidnapped by raiders from [[Krak al-Niraan]]. The raiders took her back to the fortress where she fell victim to [[Jamal al-Yindannim]]'s advances. Jamal impregnated Aisha and had her moved to his special ''harim'' which was full of other women in similar condition. Aisha was convinced she was Jamal's favorite wife and no idea that she was actually carrying a vile [[nasnas]] within her womb.
