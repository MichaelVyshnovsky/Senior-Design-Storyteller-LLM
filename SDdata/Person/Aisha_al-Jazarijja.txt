Aisha al-Jazarijja was a member of the House of Hanif tribe within the Haunted Lands in 1367 DR.
Aisha, along with her sister Dalida, was kidnapped by raiders from Krak al-Niraan. The raiders took her back to the fortress where she fell victim to Jamal al-Yindannims advances. Jamal impregnated Aisha and had her moved to his special harim which was full of other women in similar condition. Aisha was convinced she was Jamals favorite wife and no idea that she was actually carrying a vile nasnas within her womb.
