        "mainbody": "haladass was a mage of Alaghôn in Turmish who was long dead by the mid–14 century DR.\nHe once owned a round tower in Alaghôn, but it was later looted and its magic deteriorated. Finally, it fell down and another building was erected on the site. All that remained as of around 1360 DR was its circular base and well-warded cellar, known as the Wardrobe of Jhaladass."
