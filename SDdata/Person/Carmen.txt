Carmen was a human fighter.
She had pale skin and long, auburn hair, and wore a white tunic with red details over a suit of chain mail. The ensemble was tied together by a matching red cloak and belt.
Carmen was passionate about learning the art of combat, practicing every day and seeking instruction wherever possible. Although she was talented, her confidence was often shaken when fighting monsters. She had a tendency to be too trusting of strangers.
She was an uncommonly skilled fighter for her age.
In addition to her suit of chain mail, Carmen owned a dagger, a short sword, and a ring of warmth.
