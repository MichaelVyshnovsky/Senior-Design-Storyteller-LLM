        "mainbody": "Andorn was a looter that worked for the gnome Gimblebock in the late 15 century DR.\nThe man had light brown hair and wore a leather armor. Andorn fought with a rapier, and when fighting, assumed a fencing style while holding a torch in the other hand. He carried a small bottle of a mysterious liquid that had dried up.\nIn the 1490s DR, Andorn and his fellow looters were trying to find their way further into a crypt in West Faer√ªn, somewhere between the cities of Elturel and Baldurs Gate. He stood guard behind a locked ornate door that he held the key to."
