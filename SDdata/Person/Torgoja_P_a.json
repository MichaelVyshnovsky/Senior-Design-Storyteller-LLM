        "mainbody": "High Lama Torgoja Pa was a human monk and lama of the Path of Enlightenment dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash in the Chigidi Mountains on the Plain of Horses circa .Torgojas faith is unknown, but is assumed to be the Path of Enlightenment because of his red robes and Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms Volume I pages 84–85 stating that this is a common faith of the Plain of Horses followed by \"most\" lamas there.\nPas early life was little known. He first appeared in the Plain of Horses around , seeming to be nothing more than a nomad with two black camels who arrived at Alamaqu, a city of the Taghur tribe. But only days later he had persuaded local rebel leaders to give up their plan to depose the tribes ruling triumvirate.\nHe went west and stopped in Peqqir, where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to mulberry farms on mountain slopes. The grateful Guychiang tribe offered to construct a temple in his honor, but Pa refused and continued on his way.\nAfter a while, around , Pa made his home on Mount Or-Ghash and became the high lama there.\nAlthough he preferred the company of his two camels to that of his fellow lamas, Pa was known to be amiable and nice. He had a reputation for wisdom and a noble spirit.\nMany people, from farmers to nobles, came to ask Pa for his counsel and he welcomed all of them.\nHe was plump of body, with bushy eyebrows and a short brown beard. His youthful appearance belied his age—he looked to be only around 30 years old around, despite his past—and he would never say how old he really was.\nHe wore a red robe that was old, tattered, and had numerous repairs."
