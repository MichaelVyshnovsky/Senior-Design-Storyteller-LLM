Gareth Gimorrin was a bloodforge mage in the city of Konigheim in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
When the Legendary Campaign leader rested in Konigheim, Gareth Gimorrin attacked with a rain of fire in an effort to stop the campaign. Alerted by a watchman, the leader fought Gareth in a bloodforge battle through the once-again blazing city.
