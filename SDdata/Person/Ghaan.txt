'''Ghaan''' was a male [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Poison Dusk]] tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].<ref group="note">From the text, it is unclear which of Kruthaak and Ghaan is the female lizardfolk which is the male Poison Dusk; it is assumed they are named in the same order they are described.

He was captured by the [[Shadowscales]] and taken to the [[Lost Refuge]]. Ghaan, [[Kruthaak]], and [[Steersissk]] escaped through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] but found themselves in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]], and were recaptured. In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Ghaan and Kruthaak were kept in the prisoner pit of the [[Shadowscale Warren]], awaiting transformation into [[shadowslain]] and becoming Shadowscales themselves. They may have been rescued by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]], and shared what they knew.
