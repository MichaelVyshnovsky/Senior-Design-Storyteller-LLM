'''Poke''' was a [[monk]] and a member of the [[Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred]] at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]]. Poke was the head of the monastery at the time, holding the rank of Grand Master of Flowers.

Grand Master Poke died suddenly in the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]]. This necessitated that [[Kane]], a Master of Spring and next-in-line for the position of Grand Master, hurry back to the monastery and manage affairs until a new Grand Master could be trained and selected. However, Kane had no wish to remain in the position, and the next most senior monk, [[Temmenische]], was near a hundred years of age. Thus Kane and Temmenische selected the much younger [[Cantoule]] to succeed Poke as Grand Master.
