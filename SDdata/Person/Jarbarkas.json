        "mainbody": "Jarbarkas was a skilled fighter who aided the dwarf resistance in Llorkh in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nJarbarkas had caramel-colored shoulder-length hair and wore an orange headband. The muscular man wore a gold pendant and a green outfit.\nThe strong warrior wore chainmail and fought with a greatsword, as well as a composite longbow. He was versed in both fighting at close range with his two-handed sword, and at far range with his bow.\nJarbarkas grew up in the village known as Windycliffs along the Sword Coast. In 1358 DR, both his village and Leilon were pillaged by Luskar pirates. The buccaneers went even further, and burned many houses, including his own. The warrior swore revenge on the pirates, and set out to aid the Lords Alliance. Jarbarkas signed on as part of a Waterdhavian volunteer force to aid the dwarves of Llorkh, who were heavily oppressed by the Zhentarim.\nWhen the volunteer force arrived in Llorkh, they were ambushed by the Zhentarim, and taken prisoner. Jarbarkas was questioned by Lord Geildarr Ithym himself, but did not give any information over. A giant skeleton was animated to kill the fighter, but he was saved by the Heroes of Ascore and the dwarven resistance force. He informed the group about the magical crystals used by the Zhentarim and their allies, and advised the heroes to search their bodies carefully. After this, he asked to join the heroes on their mission.Jarbarkas and his female counterpart, Siulajia, were the first ever NPCs in a video game to be able to fall in love with a player character. Thus, they only joined the group if the party leader was of the opposite sex."
