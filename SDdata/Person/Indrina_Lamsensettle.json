        "History": "At some point, Indrina paid for genealogical research into the family history of Neverwinter's ruler, [[Dagult Neverember]].\n\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{Vecna-time}} Indrina and other three nobles were kidnapped by a group of [[Vecna]] cultists and taken to Neverwinter's graveyard, [[Neverdeath]]. Indrina was certain that the mastermind behind her kidnapping was none other than Dagult Neverember. She believed he was planning to silence her to prevent her from divulging information that would prove Lord Neverember had no blood ties to Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]]. In truth, he was unconcerned with her findings."
