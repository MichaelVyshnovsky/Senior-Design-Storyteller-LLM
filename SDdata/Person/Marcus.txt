Marcus was a potter in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Marcus was a priest of Chauntea in Secomber but an argument with the high priest stripped him of his powers and rank. He relocated in Daggerford, working as a potter and secret agent for the duke, spying over the Farmers Quarter and acting as a courier for important documents. He dreamed of taking vengeance against the church of Chauntea but his moral objections always stopped him.
