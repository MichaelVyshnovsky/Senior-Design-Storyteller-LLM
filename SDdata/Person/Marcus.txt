'''Marcus''' was a potter in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Marcus was a priest of [[Chauntea]] in [[Secomber]] but an argument with the high priest stripped him of his powers and rank. He relocated in Daggerford, working as a potter and secret agent for the duke, spying over the Farmers' Quarter and acting as a courier for important documents. He dreamed of taking vengeance against the [[church of Chauntea]] but his moral objections always stopped him.
