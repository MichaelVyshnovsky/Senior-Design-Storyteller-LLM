        "mainbody": "Alicine Bricket was a spoiled and money-loving noblewoman from Daggerford, sister to Muriel and Elveronne Bricket in the 14 century DR.\nAlicine wan an older human woman with a neatly affixed hairstyle, pulled back to expose her broad forehead.\nAlicine had a submissive personality, dominated by her sister. She valued her familys traditions and customs. Her handwriting was sophisticated, and she tended to write in flowery prose. Her hard leather found and decorated journal was doused in the pleasant stench of perfume.\nAlicines good friend, Sancha, hailed from the town of Bowshot. Since early childhood, they had been penpals and remained close while remaining physically apart through most of their lives.\nLike her sister, Alicine openly feuded with their brother over his strict money management and tight control of the Bricket family estate. In 1372 DR, Muriel Bricket hatched a plot to poison the old man and take over the family fortune without Alicines knowledge.\nAs a final act of defiance during the funeral, Alicine bent down to Elveronnes body, pretending to pay respects. With a quick sleight of hand, she pocketed the mans beloved enchanted elven keepsake necklace, the item she longed for many decades. She cherished taking the thing Elveronne loved the most in life and planned on enjoying the taste of revenge daily by looking at the intricate piece of stolen jewelry. However, that act had fateful consciences.\nSoon after Elveronnes death, Muriel and Alicine organized a lavish party to celebrate their freedom. The sisters invited several of their friends, including Sancha, all of whom shared disdain for the old man. However, during the celebration, Elveronne Bricket rose from the Bricket family crypt and shambled towards the Bricket Homestead house in the Western Farmlands. The corpses disappearance prompted the individual later known as the Hero of Daggerford to investigate the strange occurrence. This led the Hero and their companions to the odd celebration. Once sisters realized the Hero of Daggerford investigated the death of their \"beloved\" brother, both excused themselves from the party and headed to the second floor of the manor, attempting to hide any evidence there might be of the murder. Alicine feverishly tossed her diary into a locked chest inside her room and, when confronted with her suspicious actions, claimed that she merely organized old papers. However, the Hero clearly heard a thump of a heavy hardbound book.\nAlicines journal revealed to the Hero that she stole Elveronnes beloved keepsake - the act that was the likely reason for his return from the grave. Upon further investigation, the Hero discovered Muriels murder weapon, a potent poison, revealing the true culprit. When confronted with the truth, Alicine was horrified by her sisters actions and her own celebrations of the old mans death. She wished to trade places with Elveronne, as his death was unjust.\nThe Hero discovered Elveronne Bricket in his undead form, burning with palpable hatred and murder lust, shuffling around the manors basement. Ignoring the creatures revenant form, the Hero communicated with Elveronne and discovered that the undead wanted revenge or his keepsake returned. However, it was unknown if the Hero poured the holy water on Elveronne, destroying him, negotiated the return of the enchanted elven keepsake necklace, or allowed old man Bricket to exact his murderous revenge. One thing was clear - in the end, Elveronne Bricket was returned to eternal rest, one way or another."
