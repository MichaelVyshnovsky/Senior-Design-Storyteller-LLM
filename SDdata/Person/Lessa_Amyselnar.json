Lessa trusted that Tymora and Umast would heal the sick.\nLessa was a priestess of Tymora.\nLessa had strawberry blonde hair, long enough to reach her waist, and dark blue eyes, but an otherwise unremarkable appearance. She was 5 feet and 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall.\nIn combat, Lessa wore chainmail and fought with a footmans mace. She kept five vials of holy water and a holy symbol of Tymora.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryPriests of Tymora\nCategoryWorshipers of Tymora\nCategoryInhabitants of The Ladys Favor\nCategoryInhabitants of Sevenecho\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryClerics\nCategoryClerics of Tymora\n5yfs2rmy6e3f8zhshtq0f6poyeh0r6u"
