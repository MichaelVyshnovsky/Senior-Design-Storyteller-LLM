        "Relationships": "Anna was in love with the fisher named [[Sy]]. The two dreamt of moving to [[Baldur's Gate]] together, a goal that helped them endure hard times during their relationship.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Anna wrote a letter to [[Sy]], telling her partner the time was right for them to move to the big city. Anna planned to meet Sy near the \"hill overlooking the old bridge\", carrying only whatever he could upon his person.\n\nUnfortuantely the two would never meet. Sy was killed when a [[mind flayer]] [[nautiloid]] came crashing down upon the shore of the [[River Chionthar]], right where Sy and other fishers were working."
