        "mainbody": "'''Eden of the Clearlight''' was the leader of the [[Coin Spinners]] gang in [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3321}}",
        "Personality": "She was a self-proclaimed [[cleric|high priestess]] of [[Tymora]],{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3325}} but in reality she was a self-serving, greedy person with few, if any [[divine]] powers.",
        "History": "When she was young, her mother drank herself to death. At an early age, she joined an adventuring company and left Luskan for a while.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3939}} The Coin Spinners were active in Luskan at least as early as [[1475 DR]], so Eden had apparently returned to Luskan by then.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|675}}\n\nIn [[1480 DR]], Eden hired [[Toytere]], the leader of the [[Dead Rats]] gang, to kidnap [[Myrin Darkdance]]. After Myrin was captured, Eden was approached by [[Lilten]], a high priest and chosen of [[Beshaba]] and ordered to leave Myrin alone.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3891}}\n\nA few days later, [[Kalen Dren]] cowed each of the gangs in Luskan over a ten-day period and announced a public assembly to select a king of Luskan. Eden showed up with her Coin Spinner entourage and the assembly of gangs quickly broke into a melee. The [[demon]] [[Scour]] arrived in the form of a swarm of vermin and attacked the gangs, killing many. Eden used [[magic]] (either [[magic item]]s or possibly divine [[spell]]s) to shield her followers from the swarm and many rival gang members flocked to her banner.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5308}}\n\nLater, Lilten gave Eden a [[scroll]] that had the power to invoke the Abyssal [[Fury]] plague. When Eden ignored Lilten's instructions regarding Myrin, he showed up at her temple. Thinking she could summon the plague swarm to attack Lilten, Eden read the scroll. Unfortunately for Eden, the plague had been banished by Kalen and rather than summoning the plague swarm, she summoned a swarm of common vermin that devoured her.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6603}}",
        "Description": "Eden was not an attractive woman.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3767}} She had a lame leg and wore a brace.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3766}} She had one missing eye, in which she wore her platinum coin.",
        "Possessions": "Eden had a [[magic|magical]] [[platinum]] coin that could absorb most harmful magic, which she wore in her empty eye socket.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5754}}\n\nEden lived in the [[Clearlight]], Tymora's run-down temple in Luskan.",
        "Relationships": "Eden was Kalen's older sister but they despised each other.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3761}} Eden enjoyed dallying with hunky men.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|?}}"
