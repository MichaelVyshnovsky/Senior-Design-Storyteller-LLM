The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: \"C Balderk. Taken by Umberlee's rage. Recovered by Her grace.\" Balderk's grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and the body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with the [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
