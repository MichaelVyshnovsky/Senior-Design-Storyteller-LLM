It has not been proven that meenlocks have a spoken language, thus her assumption that such a language exists may be misguided. On the other hand, the presence of language periodization (i.e., a Classical period) indicates that it had distinct phonetic or grammar characteristics at different stages of language development and inherently acknowledges the existence of this language."
