'''Hekaton''' ({{Pronounce|HECK|uh|tawn|refs={{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|33}}}}), also known as the '''Storm King''', was the ruler of the [[storm giant]]s―and in fact all of [[giant]]kind―until sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. As his glorious reign came to an end, Hekaton suffered great indignities in his final years. The Storm King was slain, transformed into an [[undead]] monstrosity, and tortured in the [[Nine Hells]], before finally finding peace in the afterlife of [[Stormhold]].

{{Quote|I alone am worthy to decide where lightning strikes.|Hekaton the Storm King.{{Cite MTG|CLB|196|Storm King's Thunder|[[Alexander Mokhov]]}}}}

==Personality==
[[File:Storm_King's_Thunder.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The fury of Hekaton, the Storm King.'']]
King Hekaton wielded respect and fear as his primary means to uphold the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]]―the social structure of all giantkind―and keep the lesser giant races in line. His command over them were bolstered by the numerous powerful [[artifact]]s he wielded.

He was not without doubt or introspection however. In his final years, Hekaton lost his connection with the members of the [[giant pantheon]] and most importantly their patriarch, [[Annam All-Father]]. Hekaton came to the belief that the era of the giants were at an end, and the 'small folk' (as giants called them) were set to inherit the Realms of [[Faerûn]]. While his outlook was shaken to its core in life, the soul of the beleaguered king suffered even worse fate in undeath.

==Abilities==
While Hekaton the king of storm giants was a commanding figure,{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|86}} Hekaton became highly resistant to magic, could not be turned by normal means, and could not be transported to any other [[plane of existence]] without his master's approval. Hekaton could still teleport himself in with a crack of thunder and conjure great storms to bring crashing down upon his foes.{{Cite adventurers league/Wings of  Death|48}}

==Possessions==
{{Quote|Hekaton the ruler, Hekaton the general, Hekaton the heroic. I don't know why I expected anything else.|Neri, speaking to her husband's outlook on life.}}
As the king of the storm giants, Hekaton's symbol of office was the ''[[Korolnor Scepter]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|18}}

Hekaton was for a time the proud owner of the ''[[Wyrmskull Throne]]'', a [[dwarven]] [[artifact]] from the long-lost kingdom of [[Shanatar]]. He also boasted one of the dwarves' ''[[Ruling Scepter]]s'', which along with the throne, were gifted to him by his wife [[Neri]].

==Relationships==
Hekaton did not much like the small folk of the Realms, though Queen Neri was quite fond of them.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|21-22}} and collaborated with them in time of need.

The king did not fully trust his elder daughters [[Mirran]] and [[Nym (storm giant)|Nym]], believing them unfit to lead the storm giants. Beyond Niri, he only trusted his youngest daughter, Princess [[Serissa]], and his younger brother, Imperator [[Uthor]].

Along with his daughters, King Hekaton raised the young storm giant [[Thellan]] as his own ward.{{Cite adventurers league/Thimblerigging|4}}

==History==
===Ruler of the Giants===
On [[Tarsakh 17]] the {{YearlinkName|1401}}, King Hekaton and his brother Uthor sailed back to their home of [[Maelstrom]] from a diplomatic meeting, when their ship was attacked by three [[leviathan (elemental)|leviathans]]. During the battle, Hekaton channeled the power of the ''Wyrmskull Throne'' within his vessel and summoned a spectral [[blue dragon]] to turn the gargantuan [[elemental]]s away.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|20}}

Hekaton ruled over the storm giants directly, but asserted his authority over all races of giants. At some point during the late 15{{th}} century DR, the gods of the giants no longer answered Hekaton's prayers and the king came to believe that storm giants no longere deserved their position at the top of the ordning. Hekaton was shaken by this stark and dramatic change, but his wife Neri reassured him that the future was then in the hands of the small folk.

Thank to Neri's belief and several omens that had arose, Hekaton decided to appoint Serissa as ruler of the storm giants. Serissa agreed with her mother's belief that the time of the giants was over. This appointment however angered Hekaton and Neri's older daughters, Mirran and Nym.

Some time ''circa'' the late 1480s DR, Neri's dead body was found on a small isle on the western coast of [[Faerûn]]. Hekaton exploded in rage and was only barely calmed by his daughter Serissa. He nearly launched a war against all the small folk of the Sword Coast, but settled on vowing to find Neri's killer. The storm giant court suffered a second disaster when the ordning was finally shattered by Annam All-Father.

Unfortunately the distraught king was deceived by his elder daughters, Mirran and Nym, along with their new ally: the [[blue dragon]] [[Iymrith]], who masqueraded as a fellow storm giant.

===Captured and Recaptured===
[[File:The Morkoth (Ship).jpg|thumb|right|350px|''King Hekaton left in bondage, stuck aboard the [[Morkoth (ship)|Morkoth]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].'']]
King Hekaton was lured into a trap devised by members of the [[Kraken Society]]. Posing as agents of the [[Lords' Alliance]], they captured the storm giant ruler and bound him with [[item enchantment|enchanted]] chains that kept him in a state of stasis. They set him adrift in the [[Trackless Sea]] aboard a shielded [[squid ship]] called the [[Morkoth (ship)|''Morkoth'']].

Eventually, King Hekaton was set free from his captors by a band of [[adventurer]]s and returned to assume the ''Wyrmskull Throne'' in Maelstrom. He thanked his liberators for their intervention and directed his forces to take revenge upon Iymrith at [[Iymrith's lair|her lair]] in the [[Anauroch]] desert.

Some time later, Hekaton invited the mercenary [[Zehira Deryan]] to Maelstrom, to discuss how the recently-acquired ''[[Iltkazar Scepter]]'' could be used to awaken powers of the ''Wyrmskull Throne''. By the time Zehira and her allies arrived the king had once again been captured, and both he and the throne were taken from Maelstrom.{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|14}} as directed by an [[Asmodeus|figure from the Hells]].

===Raised as Undead===
{{Quote|No, no...I have to remember...remember Hekaton...remember Hekaton.|[[Trildor]], while in the ''[[Word of Recall]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|33}}}}
King Hekaton was killed outright some time during his abduction.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|7}} Hekaton was raised as an enormous [[death knight]] at the [[Citadel]] in [[Thaymount]],{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|2}} in service to the lich-king [[Szass Tam]].{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|20-21}}

In Hekaton's absence, Princess Serissa emerged as the new leader of the storm giants.{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|4-7}} She devoted herself to uncovering the truth of her father's disappearance and recover the ''Wyrmskull Throne''.{{Cite adventurers league/Foreign Affairs|23}} Meanwhile the undead Hekaton employed a group known as the [[Ebon Wings]]{{Cite adventurers league/Moment of Peace|2}}

Hekaton then traveled to a hidden fortress in the [[Thunder Peaks]], where the Red Wizards were attempting to bring back the first [[dracolich]] [[Shargrailar]].{{Cite adventurers league/Wings of  Death|31}} A group of intrepid adventurers defeated the Red Wizards, destroyed the undead Shargrailar once again, and put an end to the death knight Hekaton.{{Cite adventurers league/Wings of  Death|39}} Unfortunately, the Storm King's soul languished within an infernal prison in [[Kostchtchie's Maw]] on [[Avernus]], the 1{{st}} plane of the Nine Hells.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|13}} During his imprisonment, Hekaton routinely tortured by the [[pit fiend]] called [[Duracles]]. His soul was left a mere shadow of its form during the king's life.

After being employed by Princess Serissa to uncover the whereabouts of Hekaton's soul,{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|2}} the adventurers that stopped the undead king then ventured into his [[mindscape]] and learned much about his life.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|17}} When they finally encountered Hekaton's consciousness, the group saw him enveloped in a black whirlpool of self-loathing and overwhelming fear. Serissa's heroes spoke to the Storm King and reminded him of his glorious past. Just as they convinced him of his worthiness of an afterlife in [[Stormhold]], the entire group were pulled out of Hekaton's mindscape to the citadel of [[Malsheem]] in [[Nessus]] the 9{{th}} layer of the Nine Hells.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|23-26}}

Hekaton appeared again in Avernus, held in bondage by [[Asmodeus]] the Lord of the Nine. The mortal adventurers that had come so far to liberate the Storm King signed an [[infernal contract]] with Asmodeus, guaranteeing the release of his soul from the Hells. Hekaton then ascended upwards from the [[Lower Planes]] to Stormhold, with both his existence on the [[Prime Material plane]] and his suffering finally at an end.{{Cite adventurers league/The Harrowing of Hell|27-30}}
