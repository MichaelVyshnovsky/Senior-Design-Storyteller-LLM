'''Odren''' was a devotee of [[Helm]] and one of the [[Knights of the Vigil]], who lived in [[Amn]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Along with his fellow knights, Odren was tasked by Helm to stand guard over [[Watcher's Keep]] and maintain its [[magic]]al [[ward]]s. Within the sealed keep was a profound evil, referred to as the [[Imprisoned One]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Odren and his knights sought out adventurers to aid them in their duties.

When they encountered [[Abdel Adrian]] and his adventuring party, Ordren saw an opportunity to seal away another great evil – one of the [[Bhaalspawn|mortal children]] of [[Bhaal]]. He granted Abdel one of his order's ''vigil stones'' and the ''ritual scroll'', which would allow the group to travel in and out of the keep and further maintain the seal over the Imprisoned One.
