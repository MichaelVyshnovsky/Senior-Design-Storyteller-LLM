'''Shradin Mulophor''' was an immortal [[human]] [[necromancer]] hailing from ancient [[Netheril]] who later developed and reigned over the subterranean city of [[Skullport]].

==History==
He somehow survived the fall of [[Netheril]] and lived a thousand years after.

He arrived at [[Undermountain]] in the {{YearlinkName|1148}}, during a period of major construction and expansion of the dungeon by [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. Shradin discovered the ruins of [[Sargauth Enclave]] and, with permission from Halaster, converted it into a trading post that later flourished as [[Skullport]]. He became known as the '''''Lord of Bones''''' and took up exploring the Undermountain during Halaster's occasional absences.

When Shradin returned to Skullport, he had become frail and addled, his mind ruined by the horrors of Undermountain. Though still feared, much of his respect had been lost. During the chaos of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] in [[1369 DR]], the [[Skulls of Skullport]] mounted a combined assault on Shradin, reducing him to a fine red mist. Since then, no one challenged the rule of the Skulls.
