'''Salander''' was a [[wizard]] member of the [[Zhentarim]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|29-30}}<ref group="note" name="Year">[[Dragon magazine 362|''Dragon'' #362]] provides an exact date for the events of ''[[Halls of the High King]]'', which did not give an exact date within itself.

==Description==
Salander was a notably handsome man, with blond hair and a wispy beard. His eyes gave the impression of being sharp and alert.

==Personality==
Salander was known to be ruthless when fighting and was very eager to prove his worth to the Zhentarim.

==Abilities==
Salander was known to be capable of casting the [[spell]]s ''[[blindness]]''. ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[spider climb]]'', and ''[[web]]''.

==Possessions==
While guarding the ''[[gate]]'' in Voonlar he was known to possess a [[dagger]], [[dart]]s laced with [[sleeping poison]], and a ''[[potion of gaseous form]]''.

Due to his reputation within the organization, Salander lacked the ''[[teleport ring]]'' that wizards of a 7{{th}} level or higher were usually bestowed.

==History==
Salander began his career in the Zhentarim as an apprentice to the [[archmage]] [[Olorim]] at the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. He would go on to serve the organization as a caravan guard in the [[Stonelands]], until being stationed in the [[Darkhold]].

In [[1359 DR]],{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|29-30}}<ref group="note" name="Year" /> Salander was living inside the town of Voonlar, tasked by his superiors with guarding a ''gate'' that had been recently constructed by [[Gauntather]], then-leader of the [[Church of Bane|Risen Cult of Bane]], with aid from [[Manshoon]]. This ''gate'' was in a windowless, unfurnished room and it connected to the [[House of the Black Hand]]. Salander was stationed in a room adjacent to this one, while inside it was guarded by nine [[ju-ju zombie]]s and two [[bonebat]]s.

Salander was given very little information regarding purpose of his task. If the area were to get breached and the situation turn dire, he was instructed to allow a bonebat to escape so that it could report the situation to [[Zhentil Keep]]. If hounded by such intruders, he was to drink his ''potion of gaseous form'', then retreat to the nearby [[Blushing Beauty]] inn and report to its innkeeper, [[Ralagas Therim]].

==Relationships==
Due due to something that transpired prior to 1359 DR, many within the Zhentarim considered Salander to be overly ambitious and deceitful.
