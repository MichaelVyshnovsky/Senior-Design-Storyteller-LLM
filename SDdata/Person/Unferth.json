        "mainbody": "'''Unferth''' was a member of the [[Kraken Society]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.",
        "Activities": "The priest and his partner [[Ghald]] were the Kraken Society's top operatives in this part of the [[North]], specialized in advancing the agenda of the society through theft, intimidation, and assassination. He was usually the spokesman but Ghald was in command.",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], a patrol of the [[Twelve]] near [[Triboar]] had defeated some cultists of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] and recovered a ''[[devastation orb]]''. They went back to Yartar with the orb, but just after they put it in the city's vaults, [[Nareen Dhest]] stole it. After examining it, the Hands of Yartar decided to sell it in an auction at the [[Wink and Kiss]] tavern.\n\nHearing this news, Ghald and Unferth decided that the Society needed the orb, so they formed a partnership with [[Haliyra Ravenfast]] to obtain it.\n\nGhald, Unferth, and some minions waited in a tomb near the tavern but the intervention of some adventurers ruined their plan and Ghald and Unferth were defeated."
