Rhaumon Bloodaxe, also just called Bloodaxe, was one of the earliest known leaders of Ruathym.
Bloodaxe fought with two magical items, the battleaxe named after him, the Bloodaxe, and the Redshield.
Rhaumon took leadership during the turbulent times of Ruathyms history, and acquired the title of First Axe. He lived in a mansion that bordered the sea, and after he passed on, was buried in this exact place. After his death, the mansion was fiercely guarded by undead beings.
It is said that Rhaumon Bloodaxe never fully left his waterfront home. Rumor had it that only fully loyal inhabitants of Ruathym could stay the night there without harm coming to them.
