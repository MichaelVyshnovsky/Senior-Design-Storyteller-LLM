        "mainbody": "The '''Beast Lord''' was the local name given to an [[alhoon]] [[mage]] that dwelled within the ruined mines of [[Dekanter]], carried on horrific arcane experiments, and waged a war against mostly unknown forces of the [[Underdark]], for hundreds of years as of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "The former [[mind flayer]] known as the Beast Lord was driven mad by memories of the [[gith]] taken from the [[elder brain]] at its spawning pool within ruined Dekanter. It displayed obsessive, secretive, and maniacal behavior, seemingly wanting to conquer the [[the North]] and parts of the [[Deepearth]].",
        "Activities": "Within the mind flayer's lair in the ruins of Dekanter, within the [[Greypeak Mountains]] of the [[Savage Frontier]], such as: [[bulette]]s, [[stegocentipede]]s, [[peryton]], [[beholder]]s, [[mongrelfolk|mongrelmen]]. It was believed that the Beast Lord's experiments in biological [[transmutation]] were an attempt to recreate the Gith species from the goblins of Dekanter, and in some twisted way please its former elder brain. By recreating the Gith the Beast Lord sought to achieve [[commencement]], and join its consciousness to that of its former parent elder brain.\n\nWhile pursuing its aberrant experiments and carrying out this twisted plan, the Beast Lord waged a war against some unknown forces within the Underdark,",
        "Relationships": "The Beast Lord shared his lair with the goblins of Dekanter led by [[Ghistpok|Lord High Chief Ghistpok]].\n\nAfter having formed an alliance with the [[Zhentarim]], the Beast Lord fought the forces of the [[drow]] and the [[Harpers]].",
        "History": "In [[Ches]] of the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, rumors spread about the rise of a Beast Lord in the North who used magic to create monstrous creatures, such as [[gorgimera]] and [[owlbear]]s. Around the [[1358 DR|following year]], the Black Network delivered dead bodies to the Beast Lord to encourage the illithid to not attack their caravans. \n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1361}}, the Beast Lord recovered the one of the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' of ancient [[Netheril]], somehow connected the [[artifact]] to his great [[brass]] athanor, Within [[1367 DR|six years]], the situation grew beyond the control of the [[Zhentarim|Zhent]] Lord [[Amarandaris]] of [[Parnast]], and he was forced to reroute the trail leading past the mines and pull Zhentarim forces away from the region.\n\nGrowing concerned about the Beast Lord's increasing power while in possession of the ''Nether Scroll'' the otherworldly being known as [[Lady Wyndyfarh]], dispatched a lost goblin from the mines named [[Sheemzher]] to enlist the aid of good folks from the nearby towns. Sheemzher joined with the honest mage named [[Druhallen]], his bodyguard companion [[Rozt'a]], and her foster son [[Tiep]] to steal the ''Nether Scroll'' away from the Beast Lord. The Beast Lord's powerful magic proved too much for the meager travelers, but an assault by mind flayers from Llacerelly was opportunity enough for the surface-dwellers to recover the scroll and flee from Dekanter.\n\nThe ancient alhoon survived the assault, and remained within Dekanter for a number of years. By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Beast Lord was continuing his search for ancient [[Netherese]] treasure along with his hordes of Dekanter goblins, Rumors about the Beast Lord's activities within the mountains persisted for over the following century and beyond.",
        "Rumors and legends": "During the reign of the Beast Lord, both the Harpers and the [[Lords' Alliance]] posted a reward of 500 [[gold piece]]s for any information concerning its heinous activities."
