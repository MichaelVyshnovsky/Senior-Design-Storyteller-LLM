Yoshiie was a bandit leader in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Yoshiie led a bandit gang with more than 200 members, including korobokuru, with a kensai second-in-command and sometimes a wu jen in his service. They were based in a secluded valley.
Yoshiie achieved his position through the use of fear, force, and brainpower. His men were like his children to him, but he was a stern "father" as the gang knew him. Yoshiie was protective and kind to his gang members, but had a harsh and unforgiving discipline. He received help from Kate Kenkichi, but knew that one day his gang would split.
