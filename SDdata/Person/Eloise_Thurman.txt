'''Eloise Thurman''' was an inhabitant of the [[Brampton]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Eloise Thurman attempted to report suspicious housecalls late at night among the neighbors as well as people failing to make offerings to [[Umberlee]], claiming that these activities were proof of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s activity. Eloise made the reports to [[Liara Portyr]]'s garrison, where they were dismissed.
