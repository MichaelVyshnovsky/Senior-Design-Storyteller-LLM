'''Hoshi Katahiroi''' was a [[daimyo]] of a province in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/181/Bazaar of the Bizarre|30,32}}{{Cite dragon/181/Bazaar of the Bizarre|32}}<ref group="note">It is unknown where in Kara-Tur; [[Wa]] and [[Kozakura]] are two likely candidates.

==History==
Some time before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]],<ref group="note">The date is unknown; this is only "many years ago" from a presumed setting date of [[1357 DR]]. The Faerûnian calendar is used in the absence of any other. Hoshi's province was devastated by severe tempests and lightning strikes that ignited fires. Hoshi's respected shukenja advisors quickly divined that this weather was not natural, but the work of a mighty [[dragon]] of a type never encountered before, dubbed "Celestial Fury". Some thought it arose from the primal chaos of a time before Kara-Tur's creation, others that it was a modern abomination.

Hoshi wished the dragon dead to spare his province more devastation. Thus he commissioned a reclusive weaponsmith and master of mystic arts named [[Chigatta]] to forge for him a weapon that could destroy the dragon's spirit as well as its body. Chigatta created a [[katana]], more fine than anyone could've imagined, and gave it the name of the dragon it was meant to slay, ''[[Celestial Fury]]''.

The [[sword]] was imbued with the power of flight and so Hoshi took to the skies to hunt the dragon through the storm clouds. For days, a dragon's roars and a man's shouts echoed across the skies, and lightning flashed through the nights. Finally, Hoshi was victorious, slaying the dragon's body and trapping its spirit inside his sword. The two Celestial Furies became one and the sword's order was imposed on the dragon's chaos.

To celebrate his triumph, and cement the dragon's defeat, Hoshi then asked Chigatta to craft a scabbard from the dragon's [[dragonhide|hide]] and to embed the dragon's magical [[pearl]] in the hilt.

Unfortunately, while Hoshi was a great warrior, he was weak of will and the dragon's spirit possessed him. Under the dragon's control, Hoshi killed first Chigatta, and then himself. The blade disappeared shortly afterward, probably abandoned by Hoshi's grief-stricken family.
