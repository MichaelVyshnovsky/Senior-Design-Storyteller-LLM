Imbryn Ultal was the captain of the Aelusteen, a ship plying the oceans of Toril around the 8 century DR.
Imbryn Ultal sailed between Sambar, the capital of Lantan, and the port city of Haunvaerune on the continent of Arandron, to trade in Lantanna inventions. On one such trip, Imbryn gave passage to the disguised steel dragon Velsaertirden from Haunvaerune to Sambar. Centuries later, Velsaertirden would adopt the name "Imbryn Velsaert" after the sea captain.
