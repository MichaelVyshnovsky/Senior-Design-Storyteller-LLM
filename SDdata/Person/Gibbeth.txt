'''Gibbeth''' was a star-like [[Elder Evil]] from the [[Far Realm]] who had taken a place among the stars of [[Realmspace]]. Unlike normal stars, Gibbeth didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.

==Description==
Gibbeth was described as a green star that at its core had an utterly unknowable being.

==History==
Gibbeth and the other Far Realm–infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the [[Eldest]].

Scholars who studied stars avoided studying or even talk about Gibbeth.{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|18}} It was believed that Gibbeth's true form was a being of madness, and that this madness was contagious and even dangerous. Even a minor contact with its madness was able to create an aberrant creature known as the Scion of Gibbeth.

It was also believed that, when Gibbeth revealed its true form at the end of time, reality would be unmade just by its gaze.

Nonetheless, and despite all the dangers, Gibbeth was usually sought out by some [[warlock]]s to make a pact with it. [[Neogi]] were specially adept in seeking out pacts with it and the other Far Realm–infested stars.
