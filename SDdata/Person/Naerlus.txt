'''Naerlus''' was a [[shadovar]] spy inside [[Candlekeep]].

==History==
Naerlus went to infiltrate Candlekeep. He killed and replaced the monk [[Andannas Dalkur]].

In [[1487 DR]], after receiving a pass-phrase, he killed a person but was uncovered by [[Elminster Aumar]], also disguised as Dalkur. Elminster interrogated him but with little success. Soon after, Naerlus managed to free himself and tried to kill the Old Mage but instead he died.
