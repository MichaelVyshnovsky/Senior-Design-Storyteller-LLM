        "History": "Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], while the war with [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s forces was raging, Benzoate proposed marriage to the [[Lliiran]] priestess [[Tellasi Salilei]] while at the [[House of Thud]]. When later pressed by the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' to comment on these rumors he reacted with surprise, stating, \"I did? How about that!\" Meanwhile, the paper was unable to reach Tellasi to comment on the matter.{{Cite polyhedron/119/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter}}\n\nLater, Benzoate stayed a night at the [[Seven Tigers Inn]] before leaving the city entirely to travel south alongside [[Lorien Darkarrow]] in a hunt for the rogue [[mammoth]] [[Thundering Death]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Benzoate was one of many adventurers who supported the [[A.V.O.W. shelter]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Dog Days of Summer|18}} And he attended the housewarming party that was held for [[Briar Oldhill]] to celebrate the opening of his chapel, [[Briar's Patch]].{{Cite trumpeter/2-4}}\n\nEventually Benzoate received a promotion in the Navy, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, and in that same year rose to the rank of Golden Crown Rooster within the Knights of the Golden Rooster."
