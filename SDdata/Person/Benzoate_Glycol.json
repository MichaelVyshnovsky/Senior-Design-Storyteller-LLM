        "mainbody": "Benzoate Glycol was a rather dimwitted and extremely handsome adventurer in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.\nOver his years of adventuring, Benzoate acquired membership in the city of Ravens Bluffs Clerical Circle, its Wizards Guild, its Bards Guild, its Navy, and its knightly order the Golden Roosters.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, while the war with Myrkyssa Jelans forces was raging, Benzoate proposed marriage to the Lliiran priestess Tellasi Salilei while at the House of Thud. When later pressed by the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter to comment on these rumors he reacted with surprise, stating, \"I did? How about that!\" Meanwhile, the paper was unable to reach Tellasi to comment on the matter.\nLater, Benzoate stayed a night at the Seven Tigers Inn before leaving the city entirely to travel south alongside Lorien Darkarrow in a hunt for the rogue mammoth Thundering Death.\nFollowing the end of the war, Benzoate was one of many adventurers who supported the A.V.O.W. shelter. And he attended the housewarming party that was held for Briar Oldhill to celebrate the opening of his chapel, Briars Patch.\nEventually Benzoate received a promotion in the Navy, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, and in that same year rose to the rank of Golden Crown Rooster within the Knights of the Golden Rooster."
