        "mainbody": "Lady Moonfire was a light-hearted half-elf warlock and the civic leader of Loudwater as of 1479 DR.\nLady Moonfire was very upbeat, usually smiling or laughing. Even when she was Loudwaters leader, she was carefree and showed little interest in her duties. She was far more interested in adventure, although she had never been on any. These factors meant that although she was very likable, some residents of Loudwater feared she was too flippant to be a decent leader.\nShe was known for her proclivity to court well-mannered tieflings.\nLady Moonfire tended to wear a black gown, decorated with patterns threaded in silver. She also wore a silver amulet and ornate rings.\nIn theory, Lady Moonfires duties as the civic leader of Loudwater included ensuring the towns protection, paying and supervising officials&mdashnotably the rivermaster and dockhands&mdashand collecting taxes. However, she preferred to delegate these tasks to others, and instead focused on throwing lavish parties for rich or famous residents and visitors. She invited her guests to these events with fancy invitations scribed in gold ink. She was also known to frequent the Green Tankard tavern.\nAs of 1479 DR, Lady Moonfire was actively looking to find trustworthy adventurers who would escort her to the High Forest and help her explore Draigdurroch Tower. While outwardly her only motivation for wanting this appeared to be a desire for adventure, in fact she knew of the reputation of the warlock Draigdurroch and wished to gain access to his books on magic and rituals.\nIn late summer in the , temperatures around Loudwater and the Gray Vale began dropping unnaturally fast, and local farmers began urgently petitioning Lady Moonfire to solve the problem. Based on her own knowledge of Draigdurroch Tower, she was able to deduce that it was likely associated with the problem."
