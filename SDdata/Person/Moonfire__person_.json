        "mainbody": "'''Lady Moonfire''' was a light-hearted [[half-elf]] [[warlock]] and the civic leader of [[Loudwater]] as of [[1479 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Lady Moonfire was very upbeat, usually smiling or laughing. Even when she was Loudwater's leader, she was carefree and showed little interest in her duties. She was far more interested in adventure, although she had never been on any. These factors meant that although she was very likable, some residents of Loudwater feared she was too flippant to be a decent leader.\n\nShe was known for her proclivity to court well-mannered [[tiefling]]s.",
        "Possessions": "Lady Moonfire tended to wear a black [[gown]], decorated with patterns threaded in [[silver]]. She also wore a silver [[amulet]] and ornate [[ring]]s.",
        "Activities": "In theory, Lady Moonfire's duties as the civic leader of Loudwater included ensuring the town's protection,{{Cite dungeon/159/Menace of the Icy Spire|6}} paying and supervising officials&mdash;notably the rivermaster and dockhands&mdash;and collecting taxes. However, she preferred to delegate these tasks to others, and instead focused on throwing lavish parties for rich or famous residents and visitors. She invited her guests to these events with fancy invitations scribed in gold ink. She was also known to frequent the [[Green Tankard]] tavern.\n\nAs of 1479 DR, Lady Moonfire was actively looking to find trustworthy [[adventurers]] who would escort her to the [[High Forest]] and help her explore [[Draigdurroch Tower]]. While outwardly her only motivation for wanting this appeared to be a desire for adventure, in fact she knew of the reputation of the warlock [[Draigdurroch]] and wished to gain access to his books on [[magic]] and [[ritual]]s.",
        "History": "In late summer in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, temperatures around Loudwater and the [[Gray Vale]] began dropping unnaturally fast, and local farmers began urgently petitioning Lady Moonfire to solve the problem. Based on her own knowledge of Draigdurroch Tower, she was able to deduce that it was likely associated with the problem."
