'''Zaxis''' was a [[hezrou]] [[demon]] of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Zaxis was formerly a [[marilith]] who was demoted to this lower form of demon and later trapped within [[Ammon Jerro]]'s haven in the [[Sword Mountains]] for the purpose of empowering the [[warlock]].

In [[1374 DR]], by speaking with the [[succubus]] [[Blooden]], the [[Kalach-Cha]] discovered Zaxis's [[true name]]—Bethshiva—and his past and could use it to enlist the demon's aid.

==Relations==
Zaxis was the mother of [[Baalbisan]].
