Zaxis was a hezrou demon of the 14 century DR.
Zaxis was formerly a marilith who was demoted to this lower form of demon and later trapped within Ammon Jerros haven in the Sword Mountains for the purpose of empowering the warlock.
In 1374 DR, by speaking with the succubus Blooden, the Kalach-Cha discovered Zaxiss true name—Bethshiva—and his past and could use it to enlist the demons aid.
Zaxis was the mother of Baalbisan.
