Altho Farambler was a halfling merchant who lived at the Chang-liu-shui oasis in the Hordelands.
He was quite cheerful and usually talked alot.
Altho setup a small shop in his home, catering to clients travelling from the west. Many of the natives of the Hordelands or Shou Lung found his items to be strange and exotic.
He occasionally had trouble dealing with nomads who came to Chang-liu-shui to take water from the well, usually leaving it depleted. Altho began storing water from the well in casks that he kept inside of his house. He would sell this water to travelers if he could get a good deal.
