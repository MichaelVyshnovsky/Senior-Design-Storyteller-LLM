'''Altho Farambler''' was a [[halfling]] merchant who lived at the [[Chang-liu-shui]] oasis in the [[Hordelands]].

==Personality==
He was quite cheerful and usually talked alot.

==Activities==
Altho setup a small shop in his home, catering to clients travelling from the west. Many of the natives of the Hordelands or [[Shou Lung]] found his items to be strange and exotic.

He occasionally had trouble dealing with nomads who came to Chang-liu-shui to take water from the well, usually leaving it depleted. Altho began storing water from the well in [[cask]]s that he kept inside of his house. He would sell this water to travelers if he could get a good deal.
