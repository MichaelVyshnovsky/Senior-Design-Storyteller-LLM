The malaugrym in the mule train, including him, his sister Magusta, and two other malaugrym named Architrave and Sintre, slew the warden first and then the rest of the caravan. The two others then attacked them, forcing the two first siblings to flee through a portal,The chaotic nature of Malaugrym intrigue and the briefness of the sceen appear to preclude determination of who was Ruld, and who started the fight. However, it would seem, given future events, that Sintre and Architrave were the ones leading the mule train, as they were hunting for spellfire, which had gone into the guarded gate, while Stralane and Magusta sought the portal itself. As they had no need for a mule train to access the portal, it is assumed in this article that Sintre and Architrave had to have been Ruld and the other warrior. The assumption may change with future information. likely on Mirtul 20.\nAfter the parting, Stralane decided hed had enough of Magustas schemes, and wanted to withdraw for some recreation, thus taking his own path."
