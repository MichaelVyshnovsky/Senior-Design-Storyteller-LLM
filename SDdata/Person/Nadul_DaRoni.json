        "mainbody": "'''Nadul DaRoni''' was a [[Gnome|gnomish]] artist and inventor who lived as a hermit near [[High Horn]]. He was undoubtedly a genius, but also quite possibly a madman (which may be one of the factors involved in his natural ingenuity).\n\nSome of these inventions were not always foolproof and some were quite risky to use. His [[furnace wagon]], for instance, had a one-in-ten chance of spontaneously combusting per hour of constant use.\n\nHe sketched portraits on commission and had drawn [[Elminster]], [[Azoun IV]], and [[Aurora]] (a copy of whose portrait appeared on the cover of her [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue|catalogue]]). If someone sent him their name and location, he would eventually come and find them.<ref>",
        "Inventions": "Some of Nadul's novel creations included:\n* [[Air screw]]\n* [[Armored wagon]]\n* [[Aqualker]]\n* [[Casement guard]]\n* [[Clockpiece]]\n* [[Diving hood]]\n* [[Doubles wheel]]\n* [[Flailing wagon]]\n* [[Furnace wagon]]\n* [[Great crossbow]]\n* [[Hand wagon]]\n* [[Heartland flier]]\n* [[Hurler]]\n* [[Light splitter]]\n* [[Mechanical instrument]]\n* [[Missile thrower]]\n* [[Scythe wagon]]\n* [[Telescope]]\n* [[Tentfall]]\n* [[Underwater boat]]\n* [[Water screw]]"
