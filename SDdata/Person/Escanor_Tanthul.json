        "mainbody": "Escanor Tanthul was the eldest of the twelve Princes of Shade, the cabal of Netherese arcanists and warriors that embraced shadedom during their self-imposed exile to the Shadowfell. He led his brothers during their initial endeavors after returning to Faer√ªn in the late 14 century DR, after having spent nearly a thousand years on another plane of existence.\nHe was the most massive of the twelve princes, made more intimidating by his massive horned helmet, and night-black tabard he wore over his armor. His eyed gleamed the color of bright copper, and turned fiery red when he was angered.\nThis appearance was not his true form however. Like the other Princes of Shade, all that remained of Escanors mortal body was a still-beating black heart set within a rib cage of black bone, surrounded by wisps of shadow in humanoid form.\nPrince Escanor could be quite charming when he chose, and equally as intimidating when the moment required.\nThe mighty prince was immortalized in a life-size quartzite sculpture carved by the famous stone giant artist Aris.\nEscanor opposed Hadrhune and was closely allied with the second eldest of the Tanthul princes, Rivalen.\nDuring their time together, Escanor became attracted to and then infatuated with Vala Thorsdotter, For a time, Vala insisted that she remain by the princes side, but changed her mind when he revealed his true intent for her that she remain his escort within his estate in the flying city of Thultanthar.\nThe growing bond forming between Escanor and Vala incited intense feelings of jealousy in the Evereskan elf Galaeron Nihmedu. Prince Escanor and Galaeron were forced to still work alongside one another however for a time, as the elf possessed a wealth of knowledge about the phaerimm bestowed upon him by Escanors late younger brother Melegaunt.\nDuring the Return of the princes in the , Escanor was the first to appear before the youngest brother Melegaunt at the site of the Karsestone. In the marsh they first met Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep, the first diplomat of the Realms with which they would ally to defeat their ancestral foes.\nIn the months that followed, Escanor led the princes efforts in trapping the phaerimm within the Greycloak Hills, trapping them between Evereskas mythal and the shadowshell they created some distance beyond it. It was then he began working with the Evereskan elf Galaeron. During their efforts, Escanor was seriously injured by one of the creatures and returned to Thultanthar to recover. After his recovery, Escanor and Vala refocused their efforts towards the phaerimm that surrounded the ruins of ancient Myth Drannor. \nOn the eve of their departure from Thultanthar, Galaeron had a falling out with Vala and was presented before the Most High Telamont Tanthul back in Thultanthar. \nEscanor was killed in bed within his palace in Thultanthar by Vala Thorsdotter."
