The half-dragon template was likely used to explain her fire-breathing ability, but her gender-change is likely a mistake, since ''Lands of Intrigue Book One: Tethyr'' goes into far more detail about ''her''.",

        "mainbody": "'''Purlakhonthiis''' was the [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]] of [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Lhaeo]], [[Elminster Aumar]]'s sage who would become king of [[Tethyr]]. She was a platinum-colored pseudodragon with unique abilities.",
        "Description": "'''Purl''', as she was called, had platinum scales and appeared even more like a miniature [[dragon]] than a typical pseudodragon. She received her unique appearance from [[Permanency|permanent]] spells that were cast upon her.",
        "Personality": "As was typical of her kind, Purl was playful. Her games included scaring the royal [[farsann]] [[Corwin Vineshigh]], who had a fear of dragons. However, in truth, she was protective of Corwin and would growl at anyone treating him unkindly. Likewise, she was extremely protective of her master, Haedrak, and the royal family.\n\nPurl hated Duke [[Inselm Hhune]], Count [[Dancon Riiklass]], and Count [[Krimmon Amethystall]] and would growl and hiss at them.",
        "Abilities": "Purl had the improved senses and vision typical of pseudodragons, as well as their resistances. She could communicate telepathically if she desired. Her skin was tougher than a usual pseudodragon, and also unlike them, she could breathe fire from her snout. She also had the innate ability to detect poisons near her, and her breath would neutralize them and cause them to turn black in color.",
        "History": "Purl became Lhaeo's familiar in [[1368 DR]]. At Elminster's suggestion, Lhaeo empowered her further with magics to make her the unique creature she was.\n\nLhaeo and Purl left [[Shadowdale]] on [[Eleasis 10]], and she accompanied him to [[Voonlar]] and then [[Waterdeep]] and then Tethyr.\n[[File:Escape from Shoonach.png|thumb|right|270px|''[[Timoth Eyesbright]], [[Zaranda Star]], Purlakhonthiis, and [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] escaping from the ruins of [[Shoonach]].'']]\nDuring the [[Second Siege of Myratma]], Purlakhonthiis assisted Lhaeo (now Prince Haedrak) and [[Timoth Eyesbright]] in rescuing [[Zaranda Star]] from [[Shoonach]]."
