        "mainbody": "'''Allister Marnley''' was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] who died some years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''\"Allister Marnley.\" Sounds human, and the grave wasn't recent. He must have died some time ago. And I mourned him already. He'd surely not have been buried here if he was exposed - he must have taken the secret of his faith to the grave, undiscovered. A very Sharran ending.''|Shadowheart}}",
        "History": "Allister died sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}} and was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], not far from the [[Durinbold Mausoleum]]. His gravestone was etched with a single inscription: \"Here rests Allister Marnley, taken too soon.\" A single love letter was left on the man's grave marker. [[Shadowheart]], a member of the [[Absolute Adversaries]] had known the man in her past, but the memory was taken away by the [[Church of Shar]]. But even with the memories gone, she still felt a twinge of sorrow over that loss, implying that Allister was someone she loved in the past, possibly a fellow Sharran who led a clandestine life and hid his faith. His grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
