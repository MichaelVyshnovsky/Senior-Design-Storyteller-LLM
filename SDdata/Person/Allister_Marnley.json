His gravestone was etched with a single inscription \"Here rests Allister Marnley, taken too soon.\" A single love letter was left on the mans grave marker. Shadowheart, a member of the Absolute Adversaries had known the man in her past, but the memory was taken away by the Church of Shar. But even with the memories gone, she still felt a twinge of sorrow over that loss, implying that Allister was someone she loved in the past, possibly a fellow Sharran who led a clandestine life and hid his faith. His grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body risen as a zombie by Nina Dortmell, a talented child with a gift, who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
