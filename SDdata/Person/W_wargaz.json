        "mainbody": "Ch'r'ai '''W'wargaz''' was the [[githyanki]] inquisitor who led the search for the ''[[Astral Prism]]'' for Queen [[Vlaakith CLVII]] during the 15{{th}} century of the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faerûnian calendar]].\n{{Quote|Some of your species say knowledge is power. They are wrong. Knowledge is ''everything''.|Ch'r'ai W'wargaz.}}",
        "Description": "W'wargaz kept his head clean-shaven and had but a few battle scars on his face. He had ethereal, steel-colored eyes.",
        "Personality": "He was an intimidating individual who was wholly dedicated to Queen Vlaakith and her eternal efforts to retain dominion over the githyanki people. He was considered both exceptionally insightful and intelligent.",
        "Possessions": "W'wargaz wore a suit of [[githyanki half-plate]] armor and wielded a heavily ornamented ''[[githyanki greatsword]]''.\n\nHe wore atop his brow a ''[[circlet of psionic revenge]]'', which bolstered his mental fortitude and allowed him to inflict [[psionic]] damage upon anyone that assailed him with magic or other supernatural effects.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ch'r'ai W'wargaz descended upon [[Crèche Y'llek]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] on the planet of [[Toril]]. He directed the crèche's commander, Kith'rak [[Therezzyn]], to halt all other activities and focus her forces solely on locating and retrieving the ''Astral Prism''.\n\nHe took interest in a group of [[adventurer]]s who had become involved with the [[cult of the Absolute]]. W'wargaz viewed the cult as the first symptom of the illithid's [[Grand Design]], the earliest stages of which had been implemented by an [[elder brain]] beneath [[Moonrise Towers]], and three mortal [[Chosen]] of the region's [[Faerûnian pantheon|local gods]]."
