        "mainbody": "Hlael Toraunt was a Zhentarim scrier of middling power in the mid-14 century DR.\nHlael was gloomy, timid, and somewhat sarcastic.\nHlael was middling in power and authority within the ranks of the Zhentarim. Korthauvar, in particular, could use some spells through a farscrying.\nHe also didnt need his neck to drink.\nHlael was shorter than Korthauvar.\nHlael and Korthauvar Hammantle were friendly enough, and often bantered together.\nHlael and Korthauvar had access to extensive resources for the purpose of scrying. He also carried some potions of healing.\nAt some point, Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle had discovered a stretch of passageway in their hideout that was proof against scrying of some form. While there in late , they badmouthed the policy of snatching spellfire, considering it too costly to send more than a few moges unknown to them, they were being spied by Drauthtar Inskirl, who, taking their advice, sent the two of them alone to snatch spellfire.\nThey resolved to work smarter, not harder, and to try and avoid actually snatching for Shandril as long as they could. To find her, they began by scrying for gates employed recently by Tessaril Winter, quickly ascertaining she had traveled along with two others through Tombgate. Reasoning those two others mustve been Shandril Shessair, the spellfire-wielder, and Narm Tamaraith, her husband, they decided those two were headed for Scornubel. Before committing to their findings, however, they scried on Tessaril herself, only to find her protected by proximity to Azoun IV and the intense wardings that shielded him. They resorted to scrying on a highknight in Azouns personal retinue instead, learning the two of them had been disguised as priestesses of Chauntea.\nOnce they locked in to the caravan, Korthauvar judged it too full of dangerous people to try and snatch for spellfire directly at the time, dithering through the first few ambushes. Though Hlael became unsettled, Drauthtar Inskirl, their immediate superior, approved of their strategy and said as much while they waited. They were forced into action, however, as a spell materializing a cloud of blades converged on Shandril, and Korthauvar cast something through their farscrying to break that spell. Hlael then recast their farscrying. They continued to dither afterwards as the caravan reached Triel, after taking stock of the spellfire seekers still in the caravan though they feared Drauthtars wrath, he informed them again he approved. Unknown to them, they were in turn farscried by the Red Wizards under Hulriviors command.\nThey were sent into action directly by Hesperdan shortly after they scried Marlel slaying Hulrivior in Triel during a meeting. They made their move just as the final ambush fell on the caravan, and converged on Sharantyr, who had just arrived. Korthauvar Hammantle was slain there, by Narm Tamaraith.\nHlael survived him and ran, looking to recruit the swordsmen currently serving Deverel Rinthar, who posed as a cheese trader he was skewered through his throat by Sharantyr not long after. She probably missed his oesophagus and trachea somehow, as he somehow drank three potions of healing to survive just long enough to be disintegrated by Shandrils spellfire as soon as she realized he was alive."
