Ivor "the Grinder" Chernin was a Vindicator of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa in the late 15 century DR.
As a Knight-Vindicator of the Warlock Knights, Lord Chernin was a powerful member of the feudal elite, and had lesser lords ("Fellthanes") swearing their allegiance to him. He was dedicated to the Voice of Telos and venerated the primordial Telos.
Ivor presented himself as a bold and cruel military commander unafraid to embrace his evil side.
As a Knight-Vindicator, "the Grinder" was adept with both weapons and arcane magic, had access to ironfell equipment, and could channel the radiant powers of Telos.
