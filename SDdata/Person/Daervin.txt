'''Daervin''' was a [[Highknight]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He served alongside other highknights, [[Forold]] and [[Regrar]] amongst them.

==History==
Daervin was part of [[Azoun IV]]'s retinue as of late {{yearlink|1357}} during the king's trip to Eveningstar, to meet with [[Tessaril Winter]]. In that trip, while carrying a roasted [[bustard]], Daervin witnessed a [[malaugrym]] impersonating King Azoun reverting to its normal shape, and attacking both Tessaril and the king; he quickly hacked away at it with his sword, but the creature crushed and decapitated him before fleeing.

He was buried in a gorge near [[Eveningstar]] afterwards.
