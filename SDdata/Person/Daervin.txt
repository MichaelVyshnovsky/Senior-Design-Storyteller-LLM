Daervin was a Highknight in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He served alongside other highknights, Forold and Regrar amongst them.
Daervin was part of Azoun IVs retinue as of late  during the kings trip to Eveningstar, to meet with Tessaril Winter. In that trip, while carrying a roasted bustard, Daervin witnessed a malaugrym impersonating King Azoun reverting to its normal shape, and attacking both Tessaril and the king he quickly hacked away at it with his sword, but the creature crushed and decapitated him before fleeing.
He was buried in a gorge near Eveningstar afterwards.
