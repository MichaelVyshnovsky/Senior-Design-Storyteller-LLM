        "mainbody": "olshur the Crooked was a priest of Ilmater, of the 3rd century DR, who held the title \"Exalted Servant\" and helped create the legendary sword Dornavver, the \"Demonbane\".\nTo counter the growing spread of evil under the Shoon Imperium and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the Church of Ilmater sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, the sword Dornavver was completed in the Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR. On the night of the Feast of the Moon that same year, Volshur, along with Archsufferer Irmakul \"Bloodthews\", Revered Brother Filithan and other senior clergy of Ilmater, took the sword and gathered at Allyns Anvil in the Alimir Mountains east of Calimshan. There they conducted a holy ritual in which their impassioned prayers and howls of suffering enchanted the sword. These events were documented in the tome Relics of the Righteous.\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryClerics of Ilmater\nCategoryWorshipers of Ilmater\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nlknweh5hg5vg47g4jy16kh2i4vakf4i"
