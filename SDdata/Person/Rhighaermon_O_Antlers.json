        "mainbody": "'''Rhighaermon O'Antlers''' was a [[ranger]] of [[Mielikki]] who traveled the Realms in the 12{{th}} and 13{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. A nobleman of [[Waterdeep]] who renounced his title, he was a noted bearer of the holy [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.",
        "Description": "He was described as \"tireless.\"",
        "Relations": "Rhighaermon was the husband of [[Dathae]] of [[Essembra]], a [[swanmay]].",
        "Possessions": "Notably, Rhighaermon O' Antlers was a long-term bearer of ''Yornar's Trail Companion''. He came to view the book as being like an old friend, as a travelling companion who was quiet but nevertheless attentive, and even spoke to it occasionally. He replaced its leather binding at least four times. He documented all the [[spell]]s contained therein.",
        "History": "Though born a noble of Waterdeep, Rhighaermon gave up his wealth, his family, and his very surname in order that he might wander the untouched wildernesses of [[Faerûn]]. In his journeys, he received ''Yornar's Trail Companion'' from a priest of Mielikki, with the intent that he one day give it to another priest at Mielikki's urging, as was the book's 'Rightful Cycle'.\n\nHowever, in the {{YearlinkName|1184}}, a thief stole the book from Rhighaermon and sold it to one Lord [[Lathamp]] of [[Elupar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. In response, Rhighaermon assembled some half-dozen other followers of Mielikki and mounted a daring raid to steal it back from Lathamp's palace. The rangers dueled the Eluphan guards along the battlements and in the galleries as they successfully reclaimed the tome from the palace vault.\n\nRhighaermon married Dathae in the {{YearlinkName|1196}}. Notably, they hung the glowing, crescent-moon-shaped ''Companion'' over their bridal bed. Afterward, while on their honeymoon, Rhighaermon finally delivered the ''Companion'' to the priest [[Klavaeron]] of [[Cedarsproke]] in the [[Gulthmere Forest]]. During this journey, Rhighaermon discovered Dathae to be a swanmay, and they stayed together all their life.\n\nYet Rhighaermon's path would cross that of the ''Companion'' again, after many years and late in his life. Since leaving his hands, the book had been stolen multiple times, until at last in the {{YearlinkName|1246}} a [[mind flayer]] tried to exchange it for a more useful [[magical item]] in a bazaar in [[Murghyr]] in [[Murghôm]]. But the man he tried to trade with was none other than the now elderly Rhighaermon O'Antlers. With every trick and tactic he knew and every magical item in his possession, Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the ''Companion'', and carried it to the closest temple of Mielikki. However, he was hunted all the way by a [[druuth]], a gang of [[doppelganger]]s in the mind flayer's employ.\n\nIt was to be his final journey. Mortally wounded and with the doppelgangers close behind, Rhighaermon arrived at last at the [[temple of Mielikki (Maerlar)|Mielikkian temple]] in [[Maerlar]] in [[Mulhorand]]. He fell into the priests' arms, still holding the ''Companion'' out to them though he could not tell them what it was. The priests charged out to heal him and protect him from the doppelgangers, when a mystery lady in green emerged from the trees and caused vines to ensnare, choke, and tear apart the doppelgangers with no more than her finger. She picked up the faithful Rhighaermon O'Antlers with a smile and disappeared, as the stunned priests fell to their knees and wept and praised Mielikki, the Supreme Ranger. A message carved on their altar would be found the next morning: \"That which I first gave to [[Yornar]], I give to all in need, my priests to use, and my rangers to carry. Let it pass from you when the time is right, and to the right mortal. You will know when. Keep it not, lest the rightful cycle be broken.\"\n\nLater, Dathae completed the ''Companion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s journey, carrying it from Maerlar to the next Mielikkian priest in the Rightful Cycle."
