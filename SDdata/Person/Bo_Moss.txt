'''Bo Moss''' was the youngest child of the Moss family of the [[Twilight Marsh]]. Baby Bo was born sometime during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|11}}

==Relationships==
Bo's parents [[Millivent Moss|Millivent]] and [[Haldred Moss]] had four other children, all of whom were older. Bo's siblings included sisters [[Alleena Moss|Alleena]] and [[Kithian Moss|Kithian]], and brothers [[Quayle Moss|Quayle]] and [[Volland Moss|Volland]].

==History==
During the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the Moss family farm was attacked by [[goblin]]s from the [[Foulwater]] tribe. During the attack, Millivent managed to scoop baby Bo to safety and leave the farm in time before being captive. The other members of the family were not so fortunate.
