Emrock Uerngulphim was a merchant in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Emrock always had with him his mantari companion Vleem. Unknown to many, he was a friend to King Azoun Obarskyr IV, Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, and Alusair Obarskyr. One of his lovers was Jhaele Silvermane of Old Skull Inn in Shadowdale.
Emrock was born in Mirabar and explored the North with his prospector parents until they were killed by orcs. Then he went south, starting a career as a thief and caravan guard. During this time, he saw many places, like the borders of Thay, Calimshan, Sword Coast, and the Frozenfar.
In time, he became a caravan master but still thieved until some angry acquaintances started to hunt for him. After a very long hunt, his pursers abandoned Emrock in a peak inside orc territory, believing he would never come back alive. Instead, there Emrock met and befriended Vleem. They remained together for twelve years.
Emrock was an able trader and gambler but by 1370 DR he mostly worked as a messenger. He often used Myth Drannor as a hideout but had a secret lair in the Vast and one other near Sundabar. Often he and his flying companion saved adventurers trapped in Myth Drannor.
