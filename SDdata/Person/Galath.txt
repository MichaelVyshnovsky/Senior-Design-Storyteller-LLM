Galath was a bandit captain who raided Mistledale during the 10 century DR.
Galath conducted raids from his fortress, Galaths Roost, located in the eastern reaches of Mistledale. He was killed, along with most of his men, when forces from Sembia retaliated.
Galaths ghost was rumored to haunt his fortress long after his death.
