'''Amaeraszantha''' was an [[amethyst dragon]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Amaeraszantha spent her time swimming and basking in a lake in the ruined city of [[Tempus's Tears]]. If someone came across her while she was in the water she tried to play dead. On other occasions, Amaeraszantha [[polymorph]]ed into a [[human]] girl posing as a sacrifice to the dragon. To eat, she waited until dark and went to eat fish on the [[Sword Coast]] or in winter on the [[Shining Sea]].

==Personality==
Amaeraszantha's passion and mission was to acquire knowledge and amusement from the little creatures of [[Faer√ªn]]. She considered the fish of the lake her private property and considered them a value food resource. She disliked dragon-slayers and [[Cult of the Dragon]] members. However, Amaeraszantha found both [[Harpers]] and [[Zhentarim]] to be fonts of amusement.

==Relationship==
Once Amaeraszantha met the bard [[Mintiper Moonsilver]], who coined her nickname, "the Great Wyrm of the Tears". She had befriended the [[Witches of Rashemen]], [[Alustriel Silverhand]], the [[Simbul]], and many other powerful spellcasters.
