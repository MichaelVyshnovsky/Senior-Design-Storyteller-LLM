Sister '''Anna Lidwin''' was a [[Darkcloak]] of [[Shar]] and a nurse who worked alongside [[Malus Thorm]] of the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]] in the town of [[Reithwin]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Anna Lidwin lived in Reithwin in the [[Western Heartlands]] before its fall sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1394}}. During that time, Anna and other nurses performed healing and other medical procedures in Reithwin's House of Healing. Despite being a [[priest]] of Shar, Anna took her profession's tenets seriously, providing healing indiscriminately. When the war between the [[Harpers]] and the [[Dark Justiciars]] began to rage in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Sister Lidwin grew distressed with Malus Thorm's inhumane orders to reserve treatments exclusively for the Sharran Dark Justiciars and to leave wounds to rot and fester for his study, claiming it was the will of Shar. Anna did not dare to disobey Malus Thorm but penned a pleading letter to the Chief Chirurgeon of the [[Harbourside Hospital]], in [[Baldur's Gate]], asking for aid.

At some point during the town's fall and the creation of the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Sister Lidwin perished and was changed by the dark [[Shadowfell]] magic. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Malus Thorm and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. They spent their unlives "experimenting" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Undead Anna offered supplies to the hospital's visitors, while under Thorm's full control.

Sister Lidwin's fate after turning undead remained unconfirmed. She could've been destroyed by the True Heroes of Baldur's Gate during their quest to stop [[the Absolute]] or left in peace in the shadow-consumed House of Healing.
