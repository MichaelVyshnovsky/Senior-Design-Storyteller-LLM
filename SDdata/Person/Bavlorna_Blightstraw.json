        "mainbody": "'''Bavlorna Blightstraw''' ({{Pronounce|bav|LOR|nah|ref=}}), also known as '''Slack-jawed Lorna''',",
        "Description": "She had a grotesque, toad-like appearance, with bulbous eyes, cracked skin, She spoke in deep, raspy voice that sounded like the croak of a toad.",
        "Personality": "Bavlorna lived the life of a hermit, perfectly content to stay within her cottage in [[Hither]], safe from the outside world. She was easily agitated, paranoid of outsiders, and obsessive over the \"treasures\" she had accumulated within her home. Bavlorna cared little for memories of the past or possible future outcomes, only mustering enough energy to live from moment to moment.\n\nOddly enough, she would have uncontrollable sneezing fits whenever she saw someone run counterclockwise.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Combat": "When she felt threatened, Bavlorna could turn foes away with a withering ray of [[necrotic energy]]. At times she even bit at her enemies and could swallow them whole in a single chomp. They would then slowly be digested by the acids within her stomach.\n\nBavlorna had limited access to [[arcane magic]], but could freely ''[[detect magic]]'' at will. She could cast the spell ''[[polymorph]]'' and a few others twice per day, and the spell ''[[plane shift]]'' once per day."
        },
        "Possessions": "Among her possessions were a book entitled the ''[[Big Book of Bad Blood]]'', within which she detailed the many grievances she perceived were directed towards her, and two [[humanoid]]-shaped [[pincushion]]s that resembled her sisters.\n\nBavlorna hoarded mundane and useless items. She had an entire cupboard full of odd mementos including unsent love letters, dried-and-pressed flowers, loose buttons, and a collection of bird feathers. The \"treasure hoard\" kept within her bedroom held similar junk items, including a stag's skull and a wooden mannequin (wearing a ''[[helm of telepathy]]''). \n\nShe did however possess a giant [[bronze]] statue depicting a frog that held within in a massive extradimensional space.",
        "Activities": "She almost never left the decrepit cottage she called home, found in the [[bullywug]] village of [[Downfall]] in the center of the swamp called [[Hither]]. Within her hut was a mysterious pool that helped preserve her physical form, and prevented it from entering into a state of rictus.\n\nOn the few occasions she did leave home, Bavlorna traveled aboard giant, ''[[bobbing lily pad]]''.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Hourglass Coven.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Bavlorna (left), with her sisters [[Endelyn Moongrave|Endelyn]] and [[Skabatha Nightshade|Skabatha]].]]\nBavlorna despised her two biological sisters, the elder [[Skabatha Nightshade]] and younger [[Endelyn Moongrave]]. She held an especially strong disdain for Skabatha and sought to recover the portrait of her that remained within her lair of [[Loomlurch]].\n\nShe made many enemies among the inhabitants of Prismeer, including [[Morgort]] the bullywug knight and [[Talavar]] the [[faerie dragon]] servant of [[Titania]] the Summer Queen.\n\nBavlorna believed she had a friend in the [[darkling]] elder named [[Charm]], but she was in fact a thief under the employ of Bavlorna's sister Endelyn.",
        "History": "After the hags of the Hourglass Coven took control of Prismeer, Bavlorna transformed her third of the domain into the fetid swamp known as Hither."
