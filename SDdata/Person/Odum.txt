'''Odum''' was a great physician-[[priest]] of the Realms. Odum stated something to the effect that what ailed one part of the body might originate in another part.

In [[1367 DR]], [[Benelaius]] used this as justification for asking Mayor [[Tobald]] to remove his clothes when examining his big toe for [[gout]].
