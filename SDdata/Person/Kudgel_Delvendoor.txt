'''Kudgel Delvendoor''', also known as the "friend of [[elves]]," was a revered [[dwarf|dwarven]] hero of [[Myth Drannor]] who died long before the advent of the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Kudgel possessed a unique [[enchanted]] elven bludgeon called ''[[Asterfellon]]'', the ''Mace of Power''.

==History==
Kudgel Delvendoor was interred within an interconnected series of dwarven tombs in the lowest level of the [[Elven Catacombs]] of Myth Drannor. The entrance to the tombs was indicated by a sign, engraved in languages of dwarves, humans, and elves, that read "Last Repose of the Stout Folk of Myth Drannor". These tombs were protected by [[iron golem|dwarven statues]] and the spirits of its inhabitants that were ready to destroy anyone who tried to claim the enchanted arms laid within the tombs, without paying the levy first.
