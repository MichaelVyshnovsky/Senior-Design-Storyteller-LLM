Kudgel Delvendoor, also known as the "friend of elves," was a revered dwarven hero of Myth Drannor who died long before the advent of the Weeping War.
Kudgel possessed a unique enchanted elven bludgeon called Asterfellon, the Mace of Power.
Kudgel Delvendoor was interred within an interconnected series of dwarven tombs in the lowest level of the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor. The entrance to the tombs was indicated by a sign, engraved in languages of dwarves, humans, and elves, that read "Last Repose of the Stout Folk of Myth Drannor". These tombs were protected by dwarven statues and the spirits of its inhabitants that were ready to destroy anyone who tried to claim the enchanted arms laid within the tombs, without paying the levy first.
