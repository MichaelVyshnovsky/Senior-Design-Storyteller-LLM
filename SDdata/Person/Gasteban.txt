'''Gasteban''' was a pirate in [[1359 DR]].

==History==
Gasteban was a noble of [[Chessenta]] who, around [[1349 DR]], was deposed and fled to the [[Pirate Isles]] with three ships. There, he became one of the competitors to the position of pirate lord and was sponsored by the master of intrigue, [[Crammar]]. In truth, Gasteban wanted only to gather an army and go back to reclaim his ancestral land in Chessenta.

In 1359 DR, a confrontation between Gasteban and [[Vurgrom]] was considered inevitable.
