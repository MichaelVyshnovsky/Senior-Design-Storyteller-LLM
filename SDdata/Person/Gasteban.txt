Gasteban was a pirate in 1359 DR.
Gasteban was a noble of Chessenta who, around 1349 DR, was deposed and fled to the Pirate Isles with three ships. There, he became one of the competitors to the position of pirate lord and was sponsored by the master of intrigue, Crammar. In truth, Gasteban wanted only to gather an army and go back to reclaim his ancestral land in Chessenta.
In 1359 DR, a confrontation between Gasteban and Vurgrom was considered inevitable.
