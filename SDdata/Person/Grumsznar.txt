'''Grumsznar''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] of [[House Fey-Branche]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He was encountered by an adventuring party, after they had been sent by [[Ssar Tarell]] to find a way to enter [[House Do'Urden]]. Grumsznar told them he couldn't allow House Do'Urden to acquire the three parts of the legendary ''[[Helm of Spiders|Spider Helm]]'', the final piece being a [[gem]]. Thus, he planned to use the companions as a distraction.

He gave the companions the house entry password, and sent them to meet with [[Rizzen Do'Urden]], who would provide them a map of House Do'Urden. Furthermore, he suggested that in order to gain full entry to House Do'Urden, they appear as part of a returning drow patrol. Therefore, with his [[illusion]] [[magic]], he transformed each member of the party into a drow version of themselves.
