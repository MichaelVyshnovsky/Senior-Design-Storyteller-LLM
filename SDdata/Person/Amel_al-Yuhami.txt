Caliph '''Amel-al Yuhami''', also called the '''Humble Servant of the Enlightened Gods''', was the ruler of [[Fahhas]] in the [[Pantheist League]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The caliph was an imposing figure with chiseled features. His height and broad shoulders made him appear more like a warrior than a [[moralist]] priest. He was believed to be one of the strongest men throughout the Pantheist League.

==Personality==
Amel was temperamental and reclusive. He believed his fits of depression and melancholy were the result of the sins of the world and the death of his trusted mentor [[Jamila al-Muhib]].

==Activities==
Amel viewed everything, especially religious matters, in absolutes. Any crimes against the [[Law of the Loregiver]] within Fahhas were punished with the maximum sentence. He spent most of his time meditating in isolation.

==Possessions==
Amel wore an enchanted broach that prevented any [[genie]] from approaching within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.

==Relationships==
The caliph was quite close with his friend and mentor, Jamila, whose death greatly affected him.
