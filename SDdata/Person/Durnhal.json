At this time, many of the lords of the Ffolk squabbled amongst each other rather than follow the High King, and King Durnhal was among those lords who were less cooperative, inviting antagonism from High King Gwylloch.\nIn the , King Durnhal and Queen Morgan were captured by Gwyllochs son, Price Ketheryll, and his Doomed Legion. They were accused of high treason, and then executed alongside other captives at the Castle of Skulls. Ketheryll kept their gold signet rings as trophies.\nOver a millennium later, tales and legends still recalled the royal couple, and speculated that their deaths had been the catalyst for the curse that ultimately befell Prince Ketheryll. In the , the halfling adventurer Pawldo and his companion Stefanik entered the Castle of Skulls seeking treasure. They escaped with the lost royal signet rings, and planned to gift them to High King Tristan Kendrick and his queen, Robyn Kendrick."
