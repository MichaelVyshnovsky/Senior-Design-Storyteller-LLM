        "mainbody": "Sevaera Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Vaelan in Durpar and a plangent. and later by Pandorym.\nHalf of Sevaeras face was plangent. One of the prostheses she bore was on her leg.\nSevaera often spoke with fake concern, an habit that upset her nephew Warian Datharathi, whom she often made crazy impositions on. She disliked being called an aunt, feeling that it made her sound old.\nZeltaebar Datharathi noticed that his siblings, both Xaemar Datharathi and Sevaera, had often manifested a different personality after taking the plangent in their bodies. Of her siblings, she was closest to Shaddon.\nShe liked playing the harp.\nSevaera played a minor role during the meeting that Warian attended in , as the nominally presiding member of the meeting. However, she was actually being manipulated by her father, Shaddon, urging Warian on his behalf to have his grandfather check up on any changes on his prosthetics. She accompanied Warian in the trip, and later served as a vessel for Shaddon himself while trying to prevent Warians escape.\nSevaera perished after Pandorym removed her head to have her better pursue Warian Datharathi. Her disembodied head was later destroyed by Ususi Manaallin on the evening before Pandorym was resealed."
