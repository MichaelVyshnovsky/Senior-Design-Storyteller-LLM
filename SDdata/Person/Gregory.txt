'''Gregory''' was a [[human]] bouncer who kept peace at the [[Black Eye]] tavern and [[festhall]] in the city of [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''A threat? Know why they call me "Little" Davey, stranger? While I ain't a small man, compared to my brothers over there I'm absolutely tiny. And they tend to be very protective of Little Davey, if you catch my drift.''|Little Davey}}

==Description==
Gregory was the oldest and the most hulking of the three brothers: [[Little Davey]], the Black Eye's proprietor, and [[Marv]], a fellow bouncer. Gregory was {{SI|7'|'"|long=yes}} tall and looked capable enough to reduce an [[ogre]] to a bloody pulp.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Gregory, armed with a [[club]], guarded the entrance to the Black Eye tavern along with his younger brother Marv. Few could best Gregory in a brawl, however [[Mantides]], a disgraced drunkard [[paladin]] managed to do just that in 1374 DR.
