        "Personality": "Dormythyrr was a brave, handsome, and very wise individual, despite his youth. He always pondered his decisions, being guided by common sense, and was not prone to anger.",
        "Relationships": "Dormythyrr truly cared for his land and the people that lived in it. For this, he supported [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s claim to the Damaran throne totally.",
        "History": "Dormythyrr was a simple farmer living near the Brandair capital of [[Goliad]] when the armies of [[Vaasa]], led by [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], devastated his land in the [[Vaasan War]] of [[1357 DR]], killing all the [[House Brandebury|ruling nobles]] The duke, [[Ebelard Brandebury]], died as well, leaving no heir.\n\nIn the [[Bloodstone Wars]] of [[1359 DR]], Dormythyrr led the commonfolk of Brandiar to create an army in order to support Baron Gareth Dragonsbane of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] against the minions of Zhengyi. This act managed to unify Brandiar and perhaps save the army of Bloodstone, and he gained the friendship of Gareth and the hearts of his people that day. Dormythyrr then became the provisional ruler of the Duchy. His time as steward saw the reconstruction of Goliad and the new construction of the great [[Church of Dionysus]].\n\nWithin a matter of months, it had become obvious to all that Dormythyrr would be declared the new Duke of Brandiar.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the main road connecting Goliad to [[Ravensburg]], the capital of Brandiar's southern neighbor of [[Carmathan]], had been [[Dormythyrr's Ride|named in his honor]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}"
