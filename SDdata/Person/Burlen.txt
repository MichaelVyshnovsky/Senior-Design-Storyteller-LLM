Burlen was a warrior from Vaasa that traveled alongside Vala Thorsdotter and a few others on an important journey to the depths beneath Evereska in the late 14 century DR.
Like the other Vaasan warriors that were honored to carry out their mission in the west, Burlen was the proud owner of a darksword. Each of these blades possessed a unique quirk Burlens sword hummed while he was engaged in combat.
In the , Burlen accompanied Vala and others of her company to hold up the bargain of Bodvar the Black. They traveled all the way from Vaasa to the Shaeradim in Western Heartlands. Together they delved into the crypts of House Vyshaan near the Sharn Wall,
After Vala and her new traveling companions entered into the returned Netherese city of Thultanthar the following year, Burlen and the other Vaasan warriors remained in Evereska. They helped defend the city against the phaerimm, fighting alongside Keya Nihmedu and the elven Company of the Cold Hand in skirmishes across the Vine Vale. 
During the battle on Mirtul 20, Burlen and his fellow Vaasan warriors suffered grievous wounds. Both he and Kuhl were reassigned to escort Khelben Arunsun. Within a few days, Khelben, the Vaasans and the rest of Evereskas defenders were united with Laeral Silverhand and the Army of the North. Unfortunately, they were all abandoned and betrayed by the Shadovar. Burlen himself was somehow compelled to attack Lady Silverhand with his darksword, severing her arm below the elbow. Fortunately for Laeral, Burlen was knocked out cold by Kuhl and they were all transported to safety.
