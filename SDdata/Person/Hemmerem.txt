'''Hemmerem''' was a laborer inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He discovered that slaves were being secretly transported with a caravan while he was working a job for the [[Piiradost]] clan. For his discretion regarding the matter, the Piiradost bribed Hemmerem and was provided work with the family's [[horse]]-breeding business.
