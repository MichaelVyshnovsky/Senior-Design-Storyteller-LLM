'''Anglathammaroth''' was a male [[black dragon]] who served as the mount of [[Undarl]], the [[malaugrym]] [[magelord]] of [[Athalantar]].

==History==
In [[240 DR]], during [[Elminster Aumar]]'s insurrection against the magelords, Undarl rode Anglathammaroth in his battle with Elminster. Elminster, however, was supported by the [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] [[Baerithryn]], who transformed himself into a [[silver dragon]]. In the fierce fighting that followed, Anglathammaroth and Braerithryn killed each other.
