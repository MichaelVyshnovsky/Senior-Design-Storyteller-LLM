Anglathammaroth was a male black dragon who served as the mount of Undarl, the malaugrym magelord of Athalantar.
In 240 DR, during Elminster Aumars insurrection against the magelords, Undarl rode Anglathammaroth in his battle with Elminster. Elminster, however, was supported by the elven wizard Baerithryn, who transformed himself into a silver dragon. In the fierce fighting that followed, Anglathammaroth and Braerithryn killed each other.
