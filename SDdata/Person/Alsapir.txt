'''Alsapir''' was a fisherman of the [[Sword Coast North]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|11}}

He was fishing in the [[Sea of Swords]] around the [[Red Rocks]] north of [[Waterdeep]] when a storm smashed his boat against one of the rocky islets, and he died there. That island came to be called [[Alsapir's Rock]] by the 1370s DR.
