'''Thurndan Tallwand''' was one of the most powerful [[wizard]]s in [[Mulmaster]] and the leader of the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]] in [[1373]] and [[1491 DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|8}}

==Activities==
As the head of this magic-oriented organization in 1373 DR, it was Thurndan's responsibility to ensure the safety of High Blade [[Rassendyll Uoumdolphin]]. Though he fulfilled this duty to the letter, it was his hope however to find Rassendyll's weakness and seize control of Mulmaster.

==History==
In [[1375 DR]], Thurndan conspired with Rassendyll to usurp [[Selfaril Uoumdolphin]]'s rule, thinking Rassendyll a more tractable ruler than his twin brother. Thurndan magically imprisoned Selfaril in a [[soulgem]] in the pommel of his sword.

In time, Thurndan came to regret his deed and tried to made amends. In the years since, he became a [[lich]] and always remained as the head of the Cloak using various aliases. In 1491 DR, he was known as '''Rastol Shan'''. In that year, Thurndan and the Sword of Selfaril resurfaced in the [[Earthspur Mountains]]. He disliked the then-current [[High Blade]] [[Jaseen Drakehorn]] and decided to take the blade and finally free Selfaril.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|9-10}}

==Personality==
Thurndan had betrayed Selfaril for what he thought was the good of his city, but he was mistaken. Under Rassendyll and successive High Blades, the [[Church of Bane]] became step by step more powerful. In 1491 DR, they put limits on the Cloaks' powers and this motivated Thurndan to act.
