Tiny Toulaine was a chef who worked in the kitchens of the Revels End prison during the late 15 century DR.
He was a heavily built man.
In contrast to his perhaps imposing appearance, Tiny was a good-humored and cheerful individual.
In times of needed, Tiny could wield his mighty saucepan the same way another man would wield a more traditional weapon.
