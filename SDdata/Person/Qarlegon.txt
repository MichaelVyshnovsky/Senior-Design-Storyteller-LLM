'''Qarlegon''' was a [[pit fiend]] in service of [[Geryon]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|1372}}, Qarlegon was sent by Geryon as the head of a sixty-strong force of devils against the [[Simbul]] while she scoured [[Avernus]] in search of [[Elminster Aumar]], then a prisoner of [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]]. She slew the entire force by dropping a mountainside on them.
