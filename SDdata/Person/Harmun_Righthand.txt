'''Harmun Righthand''' was a native of [[Waterdeep]] and a serial killer of the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], who spent much of his life in [[Tu Lung]].

==Appearance==
About {{SI|5.66|feet}} tall, Harmun was remarkable only because of his left arm terminated above the elbow, and his red tattoos across the forehead and the back of his hand. He had gray eyes, tanned skin, and a blonde ponytail. The tattoos were [[Shou]], and identified him as the servant of a powerful wizard. He spoke with a slight accent.

==Personality==
He was a bit of a loner, unimaginative but cheerful, with a great gift for storytelling. The central subject of his stories where his own experiences, which, if carefully listened to, revealed he'd killed a great many people. He had no value for the lives of others, but cherished the sense of power that killing gave him.

==Possessions==
He had an enchanted [[blowgun]] that was [[invisibility|invisible]], and used darts made of [[glass]].

==Abilities==
An experiment had left him with poisonous blood, about as deadly as a [[wyvern]]'s venom. He pricked darts for his [[blowgun]] on his own body before shooting. He was largely unfamiliar with many of the monsters of greater [[Faerûn]].

==Background==
Harmun was a pickpocket in [[Waterdeep]] until the age of 10, when his escape from a vengeful merchant took him into a ship. He became a deck hand and a guard, visiting [[Zakhara]], [[Kara-Tur]] and [[Faerûn]] over the next decade. He also developed a penchant for killing captives, as they were less trouble that way, and became a serial killer who'd kill some lower-class unfortunates before departure. He killed around seventy people while a sailor.

In Kara-Tur, he was caught for a murder in [[Tu Lung]], and became the slave of a wizened [[wizard]]ly alchemist; he was tattooed and learned to speak Shou during that time. He spent much of that time enspelled, as the wizard correctly noticed he was a murderer. During one of their adventures, Harmun was bitten by a poisonous beast; the wizard amputated his arm to save him, and her magical cure turned his blood into a deadly poison. She taught him to make use of his newfound ability, and immunized herself against it.

After the wizard killed herself accidentally with a newfound concoction, Harmun was released from his bondage, and adventured through Kara-Tur for some years before returning to Waterdeep.
