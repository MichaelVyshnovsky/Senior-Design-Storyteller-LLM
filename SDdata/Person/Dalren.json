        "mainbody": "'''Lord Dalren''' was a noble of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "During the war against [[Luskan]], Lord Dalren supplied [[Nasher Alagondar|Lord Nasher]] with troops and resources to fight the Luskan forces. It is most likely that Lord Dalren's gifts to Lord Nasher were to cover up more egregious crimes. The trade was questionable, angering [[Sand (individual)|Sand]] in particular, who felt Dalren did not deserve to live past the war.\n\nShortly before the [[Kalach-Cha]] arrived in Neverwinter, Dalren was visited by [[Ammon Jerro]], who had \"unfinished business\". Jerro killed Dalren and walked away (since Dalren did not have a [[silver shard]]), while the [[Neverwinter Watch]] locked [[Blacklake District]] to investigate this murder."
