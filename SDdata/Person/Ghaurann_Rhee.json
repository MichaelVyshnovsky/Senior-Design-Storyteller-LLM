        "mainbody": "'''Ghaurann Rhee''' was a merchant with some understanding of the [[the Art]] and a member of the smuggling and slavery ring known as the [[Tarntar]]. He sold [[spell]]s that enhanced beauty, provided adornment, or embellished the face and figure along with his line of skin-care products and cosmetics.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|35}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 29: The Battle at the Bar}}",
        "Personality": "Rhee was a smooth-talking salesman who used his good looks and skill with flattery and lies to inveigle his customers into buying his wares.",
        "History": "Sometime around the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Rhee was traveling with a cohort of his partners-in-crime and happened to be in [[Voonlar]] staying at the [[Whistling Wizard]] inn when two groups of [[Harper]]s independently decided to cleanse the inn of some of its inhabitants&mdash;creatures that were masquerading as humans. None other than the [[Simbul]] recognized them in the common room of the Wizard and taunted the Tarntar elite enough to goad them into a fight. What later became known as the [[Battle at the Bar]] destroyed or damaged quite a few rooms and resulted in the deaths of at least three members of the cabal. Ghaurann Rhee managed to escape while the Harpers were distracted by the arrival of the local law enforcement officers.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|36}}",
