Nevron was the Zulkir of Conjuration and one of the eight leaders of the Red Wizards of Thay.  
Nevron had several tattoos on his face and body. Some took on the appearance of hideous faces. He had a constant sneer on his face and the brimstone smell of his demon servitors clung to his person.
Nevron despised the vast majority of human beings, preferring the company of demons and devils. He often entertained the idea of seeking a new destiny in other planes, such as the Blood Rift, the Barrens of Doom and Despair, and similar realities. In order to achieve that aim, he tried to develop powers comparable to denizens of these worlds in an attempt to establish himself as a prince among baatezu or tanarri.
He was acquainted with the zulkirs Aznar Thrul and Lauzoril and was the declared enemy of Szass Tam during the War of the Zulkirs.
At the start of the War of the Zulkirs in the , Nevron was a member of the council of zulkirs.
In the , when it became apparent that a war against Szass Tam could not be won, Nevron killed Zola Sethrakt with one of his demons, being annoyed at her constant claims to be his equal as zulkir. He also caused the demise of Kumed Hahpret before abandoning Bezantur with the other zulkirs, fleeing Szass Tams forces.
His powers enabled the zulkirs to withstand Szass Tams attack by summoning denizens of the infernal oceans to counter the lichs undead aquatic legions. Their flight thus secured, he escaped with the other zulkirs to the Wizards Reach.
In the , he was convinced by Bareris Anskuld to return to Thay along with the surviving zulkirs to stop Szass Tam from completing a ritual that would "unmake" Toril and allow the lich to make a new world where he would rule supreme. Pushing into Thay, he and the other zulkirs snuck into the Citadel and discovered that Szass Tam had been trapped in the underground dungeons in the castle, and trapped in the artifact called Thakorsils Seat. They freed him in a temporary alliance as Szass Tams former servant, Malark Springhill, planned to use the unmaking himself. In the alliance, they defeated Malark and stopped his ritual, but immediately afterwards, the zulkirs turned on the Regent of Thay and attempted to kill him. They failed. Szass Tam apparently had a sense of humor as each of the zulkirs died ironically. Nevron was killed and his soul transformed into a mane, the weakest form of a demon, slave to all others.
