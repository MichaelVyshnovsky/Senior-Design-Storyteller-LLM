'''Nevron''' was the [[Zulkir]] of [[Conjuration]] and one of the eight leaders of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].  

==Description==
Nevron had several tattoos on his face and body. Some took on the appearance of hideous faces. He had a constant sneer on his face and the brimstone smell of his [[demon]] servitors clung to his person.

==Personality==
Nevron despised the vast majority of [[human]] beings, preferring the company of demons and [[devil]]s. He often entertained the idea of seeking a new destiny in other [[plane]]s, such as the [[Blood Rift]], the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]], and similar realities. In order to achieve that aim, he tried to develop powers comparable to denizens of these worlds in an attempt to establish himself as a prince among [[baatezu]] or [[tanar'ri]].

==Relationships==
He was acquainted with the zulkirs [[Aznar Thrul]] and [[Lauzoril]] and was the declared enemy of [[Szass Tam]] during the War of the Zulkirs.

==History==
At the start of the [[War of the Zulkirs]] in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Nevron was a member of the council of zulkirs.

In the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when it became apparent that a war against Szass Tam could not be won, Nevron killed [[Zola Sethrakt]] with one of his demons, being annoyed at her constant claims to be his equal as zulkir. He also caused the demise of [[Kumed Hahpret]] before abandoning [[Bezantur]] with the other zulkirs, fleeing Szass Tam's forces.

His powers enabled the zulkirs to withstand Szass Tam's attack by summoning denizens of the infernal oceans to counter the lich's undead aquatic legions. Their flight thus secured, he escaped with the other zulkirs to the [[Wizard's Reach]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, he was convinced by [[Bareris Anskuld]] to return to Thay along with the surviving zulkirs to stop Szass Tam from completing a ritual that would "unmake" [[Toril]] and allow the lich to make a new world where he would rule supreme. Pushing into Thay, he and the other zulkirs snuck into the Citadel and discovered that Szass Tam had been trapped in the underground dungeons in the castle, and trapped in the [[artifact]] called ''[[Thakorsil's Seat]]''. They freed him in a temporary alliance as Szass Tam's former servant, [[Malark Springhill]], planned to use the unmaking himself. In the alliance, they defeated Malark and stopped his ritual, but immediately afterwards, the zulkirs turned on the Regent of Thay and attempted to kill him. They failed. Szass Tam apparently had a sense of humor as each of the zulkirs died ironically. Nevron was killed and his soul transformed into a [[mane]], the weakest form of a demon, slave to all others.
