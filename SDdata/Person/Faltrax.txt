'''Faltrax''' was an [[incubus]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When [[Elturel]] was transported to [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, Faltrax infiltrated the city on a mission to acquire intelligence on its defenses, planning to sell this to whichever [[fiend]] paid the highest. It posed as a male [[human]] blacksmith named '''Orin Ragron''', with a shop in the city, but was attacked by two [[bulezau]]s who'd also found their way in. Faltrax would try to enlist the aid adventurers, but would flee if found out.It is unknown if Orin Ragron was a real person in Elturel.
