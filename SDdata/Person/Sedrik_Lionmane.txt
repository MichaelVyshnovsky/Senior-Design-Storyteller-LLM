'''Sedrik Lionmane''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] adventurer from the [[Quoya Desert]] in the [[Hordelands]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sedrik hailed from a poor village on the edge of the Quoya Desert. Many locals believed that he was a bastard son of some nobleman. However, the nobleman's identity was not known. By the age of sixteen, Sedrik Lionmane proved to be a talented fighter and a natural-born leader. Confident of his skills, the sixteen-year-old peasant hero left home to travel across the Realms and earn [[coin]] to improve the lives in his hometown.

Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Greenwood was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths.
