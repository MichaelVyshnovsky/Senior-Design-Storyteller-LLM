        "mainbody": "Velasta Tsarran was a drow cleric of Kiaransalee and one of the twin nieces of Dorina Tsarran in the late 14 century DR.\nA strongly built female drow, Velasta had a rounder face than most other drow. She wore darkened drow chainmail and wrapped herself in a large black cloak. A prominent symbol of Kiaransalee was often displayed around her neck. Velasta appeared identical in practically every way to her sister, Velina.\nVelasta Tsarran was a drow of erratic moods, alternating between haughty and charming when dealing with others. However, she harbored nothing but contempt for her twin sister.\nAn experienced drow cleric, Velasta had a solid command of divine magic and was able to cast spells like flame strike and slay living in defense of her deity. In addition to this, she could craft both magical arms and armor, and magic wands.\nVelasta, like her sister, was an adaptive combatant and could adjust her tactics effectively when given the opportunity or when prepared.\nAs a member of House Tsarran, Velasta was outfitted with gear befitting a priestess of her station. She wore a magic set of drow chain, a cloak of resistance and ring of counterspells. In combat, she would wield a corrosive dagger and an enchanted shield. In addition, after the plundering of Szith Morcane, she managed to acquire a number of caches of Lolthite treasure that she stored in her room.\nVelasta had a deep rivalry with her identical twin sister, Velina Tsarran, to the extent that both of them would happily engineer situations where the other could be \"accidentally\" killed off. This hatred was only exacerbated after the coup of Szith Morcane when Velasta acquired the larger share of the plunder.\nAs a female of House Tsarran, Velasta had been schooled as a cleric of Kiaransalee along with her identical twin sister, Velina. However, over the years, both sisters had developed an abiding hatred for each other. In the , during the Silence of Lolth, Velasta and her sister worked with the rest of their house in overthrowing the Lolth-worshiping drow of Maerimydra. Subsequently, they were sent to track down any refugees from the city under the supervision of their aunt, Dorina Tsarran, and made their way to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane.\nWhile her sister was assigned to the raiding parties by Dorina, Velasta was made part of a hunter-killer team of drow that was only assembled to deal with true threats to Szith Morcane.\nAt some point after Marpenoth 27, a group of adventurers launched a raid on Szith Morcane, Velasta and Velina were defeated but subsequently raised as undead revenants.\nCirca 1486 DR, Velasta sought vengeance against Archmage Solom Nedrazak, who had arranged the deaths of her and her sister. Velasta tried to profit off the fire giants invasion to take control of the outpost but undeath gave her was patience and she had no need to hurry."
