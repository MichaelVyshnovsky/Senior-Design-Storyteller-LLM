Sumbarl Ardusk was a fletcher in Hills Edge.
As a master archer, Sumbarl believed the Zhentarim were the main danger for Hills Edge. He was a careful man who always carried a dagger and an arrow.
Before settling in Hills Edge, Sumbarl fought many times against the Zhentarim and killed six Zhent magelings. Around 1367 DR, Sumbarl managed the Bent Bow Bowyer shop and was a bowyer/fletcher expert. He sponsored adventurers that fought against the Zhentarim.
