'''Sumbarl Ardusk''' was a fletcher in [[Hill's Edge]].
 
==Personality==
As a master archer, Sumbarl believed the Zhentarim were the main danger for Hill's Edge. He was a careful man who always carried a [[dagger]] and an [[arrow]].

==History==
Before settling in Hill's Edge, Sumbarl fought many times against the [[Zhentarim]] and killed six [[Zhent]] magelings. Around [[1367 DR]], Sumbarl managed the [[Bent Bow Bowyer]] shop and was a bowyer/fletcher expert. He sponsored adventurers that fought against the Zhentarim.
