        "mainbody": "'''Chiron''' was a son of [[Cronus]], ruler of the [[Greater Titans]], and a guardian of the crumbled palace atop [[Mount Othrys]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|15}} He was once an immortal being with the status of a [[deity]], but voluntarily renounced it and became a mortal.\n\n{{Quote|Theft of the titansâ€™ property results in the true death. Your [[soul]] will be forfeit. Heed me well... disturb nothing.|Chiron warning a group of adventurers on their way to meet Cronus to behave.}}",
        "Description": "Chiron looked like a [[centaur]], with a horse half that was tawny in coloration. However, his body was far larger, with his humanoid torso and upper body altogether being taller than most [[giant]]s. Overall he stood {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "Chiron was an avaricious man, using his position as a guard to amass treasure just for the sake of it. He didn't appreciate any implications that someone had power over him. Chiron also highly valued honesty and respect.\n\nPrior to living in Carceri, Chiron was a more good-natured individual known for his wisdom.",
        "Abilities": "After renouncing his immortality Chiron retained some remarkable traits. His body had an incredibly fast regenerative factor and an immunity to the two things that would normally hamper regeneration for a creature, [[acid]] and [[fire]]. The awareness he had of the palace he protected was also keen to the point of a [[dragon]], making it impossible for people to fool him with such [[spell]]s as ''[[invisibility]]'' or ''[[non-detection]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Owned a [[sword]], [[longbow]], and [[quiver]] of [[arrow]]s that were all appropriate for his size, the latter being comparable to a [[ballista]] bolt. He also carried around a large leather bag full of his valuables.",
        "Activities": "Demanded a \"fair\" tribute of anyone that wished to have an audience with his father, such as a [[magical item]] or thousands of [[gold piece]]s. He was willing to bargain over such tributes, but never haggle, and only did so in an arbitrary so as to inflate his own arrogance. Any attempts question his demand of tribute was viewed as disrespectful and he would make cruel threats upon those who hesitated to comply. If the person being asked tribute of showed him blatant dishonesty or disrespect, Chiron would double his demanded exchange.",
        "History": "In his youth Chiron lived in a land that consisted of a [[Wikipedia:Ancient Greece|collection of city-states]], There he learned the arts of hunting and medicine from the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian powers]] Artemis and [[Apollo]]. Over time his fame and skill in these fields became revered by deities and mortals alike. He went on to train many [[adventurer]]s and made a home for himself in a large centaur colony.\n\nAt some point Chiron renounced his immortality and resigned himself to living in Carceri's layer of [[Othrys]] with his father Cronus.\n\nIn the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves transported to the plane of Carceri after defending the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] from a [[tanar'ri]] incursion. At the urgings of the fallen [[paladin]] [[Elendil]], the adventurers sought out Mount Othrys and Cronus for a way back to Toril.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9-10}} When they first entered the crumbling palace they were greeted by a {{SI|50|ft}} tall [[marble]] pillar, with a column of twenty [[spear]]s jammed down one crack, each impaled with the severed head of a man that had previously given Chiron trouble. They were then approached by Chiron, who demanded tribute from them in exchange for an audience with his father. Chiron warned the mortals not to comment on the palace's crumbling marble and that his father was currently hosting a visiting group of tanar'ri. Finally, Chiron metioned that Elendil's captive friend [[Uri]] had been involved in combat with the tanar'ri, but had no idea what the battle's outcome was.\n\nWhen the group got their audience with Cronus he was deep into some kind of [[Cosmic Game]] with the [[marilith]] [[Cucathne]], the latter of whom was entertaining the titan with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17,32}} Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game."
