Konishi Ieyasu was the head of the ninja Konishi clan in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Ieyasu lived in Dojyu as a bushi named Kumorigawa Ieyasu who had retired from service to a korobokuru lord in distant Haso Province, but in truth he led the deathliest ninja clan in Kozakura.
Ieyasu, despite his age preventing him from acting himself, planned and supervised the most sensitive assignments undertaken by his ninja, while his youngest daughter, Konishi Seichi, oversaw all other family business. His presumed korobokuru ties allowed the ninja family to maintain a stance of neutrality in local politics, and ensured that bushi of "better breeding" payed little attention to their affairs.
