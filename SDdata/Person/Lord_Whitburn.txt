{{quote|''A patriar needs to get down into the Lower City now and again. Must keep one's finger on the pulse, eh?''|Lord Whitburn}}

==Description==
Lord Whitburn was a fair-skinned bespectacled [[human]] man with light chestnut hair and brown eyes. He wore quality firebird-embroidered suits of teal finery.

==History==
The [[elf]]in woman known as Lady Whitburn married into the [[Whitburn]] patriar family sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lord Whitburn received a hefty inheritance, presumably after the death of old Lord Whitburn, who was survived by the man's mother and Madeline's mother-in-law â€“ Old Lady Whitburn. During the same period of time, Lord Whitburn frequented the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of the Gate, believing the the nobility needs to keep a finger on the pulse of the city by visiting the common folk and, along the way, to shop and spend his inheritance money.
