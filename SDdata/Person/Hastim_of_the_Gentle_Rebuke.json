Hastim attacked Jerroks Concert Hall that was located in the Cormanthyr district of Myth Drannor, not far from Castle Cormanthor. The bards inside the Concert Hall were weaving a grand defense spell as the yugoloth slipped through not-yet-solid barriers around the structure. Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke started slaughtering the bards who were in the middle of the spell as it backfired on everyone inside the Concert Hall, turning the bards and the yugoloth to stone.\nIn 1369 DR, Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke along with the bards were still inside ruined Jerroks Concert Hall in their petrified state, as the bard statues continues holding the notes of the spell-songs."
