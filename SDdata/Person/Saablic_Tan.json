        "mainbody": "'''Saablic Tan''' was a former [[Red Wizard of Thay]] and a master [[transmuter]] based in [[Dorn's Deep]].",
        "Possessions": "As a show of good faith, the leaders of the [[Legion of the Chimera]], [[Isair]] and [[Madae]], bestowed upon Tan the [[Xvimvian Fang]] dagger. His red [[cloak]] was the enchanted [[Shroud of Bankao]]. He also carried the dangerous [[Cacofiend|''cacofiend'']]'' ''spell.",
        "History": "After leaving the Red Wizards to carry out his controversial research, Saablic agreed to work with a powerful devil named [[Belhifet]]. This gave Saablic many opportunities for experimentation, including creating an army of [[Neo-orog|neo-orogs]] in Dorn's Deep by building on his earlier work. According to the clone of the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Malavon Despana]] that was also in league with Belhifet, Saablic was obsessed with perverting creatures with his transmutation magic.\n\nHowever, the Malavon clone later turned insane and transformed Saablic into an [[umber hulk]], forcing him out of Dorn's Deep.<ref> Saablic, a resourceful wizard, managed to escape this fate and went on to work for The Legion of the Chimera. Meanwhile, he was credited with creating the [[Viciscamera]], a device that transformed [[drow]] into [[drider|driders]]. \n\nSaablic intercepted a group of adventurers who were on route to attack The Legion of the Chimera via the [[Fields of Slaughter]]. Saablic had sided with the League because he believed that the humans in [[Icewind Dale]] wished to destroy anyone who was not like them. Tan declared to the adventurers that he was standing up for half-breeds (natural and of his creation), whom he referred to as his \"brothers and sisters\". In the battle that followed, the former Red Wizard's life came to an end at the hands of the adventurers."
