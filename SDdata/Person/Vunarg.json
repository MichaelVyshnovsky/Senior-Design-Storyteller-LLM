        "mainbody": "'''Vunarg''' was a [[goblin]] chieftain of the [[Vunarg Clan]] allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|This isn't my horde, but I have an obligation to be here. As a matter of fact, I should probably be attacking you right now. I guess you caught me in a moment of contemplation.|Vunarg}}",
        "Abilities": "Vunarg was a trained goblin warrior, proficient in wearing [[armor]], wielding [[shield]]s, and using a variety of simple and martial weapons in combat. Vunarg often fought dirty.\n\nUnlike many of his kin, Vunarg was an eloquent goblin who spoke fluent [[Common]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved [[teleport]]ing goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from [[Luskan]] to follow two of his scouts, [[Ennelia]] and [[Braston]], southeast to the goblin fortress. Vunarg and his tribe resided in the recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.\n\nDespite having an obligation to be part of the Legion of the Chimera, Vunarg felt mistreated by the horde's [[orc]]s and [[bugbear]]s. The taller humanoids pushed goblins around and withheld food from the Vunarg Clan. The chieftain longed to be home in the plains, where they could hunt and go to war with other clans. However, Vunarg's hate for \"bloated townie scum\" overpowered his disgruntlement with the orcs and bugbears."
