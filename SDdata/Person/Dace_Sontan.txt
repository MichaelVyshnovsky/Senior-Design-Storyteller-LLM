'''Dace Sontan''' was the coordinator of the [[Spellhold]] prison in [[Amn]]. He was also the [[architect]] of the maze below the prison, where the sanity of the inmates of that asylum was tested.

{{Quote|''I work here alone against all that would come!|Dace Sontan''}}

==Personality==
Dace thought very highly of himself, believing that he was of genius-level intellect.

==Abilities==
As a vampire, Dace Sontan was extremely powerful. He could only be harmed by [[enchanted]] weapons of a certain power.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, the spellcaster [[Jon Irenicus]] and his [[vampire]] sibling [[Bodhi]] took over Spellhold to their own ends. Bodhi turned Dace into a vampire and ordered him to wait for [[Abdel Adrian]] in the dungeon under the prison.

The young [[Bhaalspawn]] adventurer was forced to destroy Dace, sever his hand from his body and use it to open the [[ward]]s that protected the maze's first level.
