'''Rozsarran Dathan''' was a male warrior who was one of the guards of the [[Twisted Tower]] in [[Shadowdale]].

==History==
In [[1357]], Rozsarran Dathan was involved in the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]]. He was off duty and just finishing a drink at the [[Old Skull Inn]] when the [[Cult of the Dragon]] archmage [[Malark Himbruel]] approached him and cast a ''[[sleep]]'' spell on him, in order to permit Malark to enter the Tower while adopting Rozsarran's appearance.
