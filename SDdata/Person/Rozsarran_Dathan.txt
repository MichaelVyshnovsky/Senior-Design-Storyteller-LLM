Rozsarran Dathan was a male warrior who was one of the guards of the Twisted Tower in Shadowdale.
In 1357, Rozsarran Dathan was involved in the hunt for Shandril Shessair. He was off duty and just finishing a drink at the Old Skull Inn when the Cult of the Dragon archmage Malark Himbruel approached him and cast a sleep spell on him, in order to permit Malark to enter the Tower while adopting Rozsarrans appearance.
