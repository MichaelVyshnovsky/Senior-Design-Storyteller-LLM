Miki-san was the leader of the yakuza gang of Miki in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In Miki, a large fishing village that had recently grown significantly, Miki-sans men acted as a peacekeeping force, while the bushi of the jito Mushakoji Nariakira were busy managing the adjacent central Niwa clan shoen. Miki-sans men protected villagers from strangers, seamen, and merchants for a price. They also managed a small gambling house. There very few incidents between yakuza and samurai, but they always resolved these with agreements, at least at the moment.
Miki-san was only the alias of the oyabun, nobody know his true name.
