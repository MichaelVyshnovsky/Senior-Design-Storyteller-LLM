'''Carynara''' was a [[dryad]] who inhabited a remote clearing within the dangerous [[Fell Wood]] in the [[Spine of the World]] in early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Carynara inhabited the Fell Wood for some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, when [[witch light]]s and [[death's candle]]s began preying on humanoids who entered the woods. Many humans, hunters, and loggers fell victim to the creatures and subsequently were raised as restless [[undead]] puppets in service of dark [[treant]]s at the heart of the woods. But Carynara rarely strayed away from her learning and enjoyed the quiet brought on by the undead infestation. She easily avoided danger and often observed a sorcerous crone named [[Limha]], who lived in a tent outside of the woods, luring children in from the nearby [[Wandering Village]] to be consumed. However, the fate of [[human]] children interested Carynara very little. Peaceful by nature, Carynara offered healing and safe resting space, as well as an occasional advice for traversing the Fell Wood, to friendly adventurers who were lucky enough to survive the forest's dangers. After one such group from [[Targos]] ended the threat of wisps, undead, and dark treants in 1312 DR, Carynara remained in her secluded home.
