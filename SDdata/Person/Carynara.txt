Carynara was a dryad who inhabited a remote clearing within the dangerous Fell Wood in the Spine of the World in early 14 century DR.
Carynara inhabited the Fell Wood for some years before the , when witch lights and deaths candles began preying on humanoids who entered the woods. Many humans, hunters, and loggers fell victim to the creatures and subsequently were raised as restless undead puppets in service of dark treants at the heart of the woods. But Carynara rarely strayed away from her learning and enjoyed the quiet brought on by the undead infestation. She easily avoided danger and often observed a sorcerous crone named Limha, who lived in a tent outside of the woods, luring children in from the nearby Wandering Village to be consumed. However, the fate of human children interested Carynara very little. Peaceful by nature, Carynara offered healing and safe resting space, as well as an occasional advice for traversing the Fell Wood, to friendly adventurers who were lucky enough to survive the forests dangers. After one such group from Targos ended the threat of wisps, undead, and dark treants in 1312 DR, Carynara remained in her secluded home.
