'''Saribel Xorlarrin''', later '''Saribel Baenre''', was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] and a member of [[House Xorlarrin]] in the mid–15{{th}} century.

==History==
Saribel accompanied the expedition led by [[Ravel Xorlarrin]] to [[Gauntlgrym]] in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}. Ravel thought her to be the youngest, weakest, and possibly stupidest of the house's priestesses. Then again, she was his sister.

In the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, she accompanied [[Tiago Baenre]] to [[Clan Battlehammer]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in an assault that left many [[dwarves]] dead and others enslaved. That same year, she married Tiago, also making her part of the restored [[House Do'Urden]]. She took his family name, despite it being against drow custom, because Tiago and [[House Baenre]] were more powerful than her own house. After her marriage, she led [[orc]] forces against the town of [[Nesmé]]. When the orc forces overtook Nesmé, Tiago and Saribel became the "Duke and Duchess of Nesmé."

==Relationships==
Saribel was the daughter of [[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]].
