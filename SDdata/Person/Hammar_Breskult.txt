Hammar Breskult was a highly skilled warrior and one of the nine founding members of the shady mercantile organization known as the Great Goblet. As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, he was a member in good standing.
Breskult was tall in stature with a well-muscled physique. He had a full beard that he kept neatly trimmed in the shape of a shovel blade. He typically wore a suit of field plate that bore the rusting scars of years of combat, and carried a greatsword.
Hammar had the calm demeanor of someone who was quite sure of himself and didnt have to prove it to anyone.
He was an excellent fighter and a former leader of a mercenary company. His skill with battle strategy and personal combat translated into dirty deals and confidence schemes in service to the Great Goblet.
In addition to his armor and sword, Hammar had several daggers of various types hidden on his person. Like all of the nine Lords, he possessed a golden goblet that contained a desiccated finger or toe of a former colleague that tried to assert his dominance over the others. Hammar was part of the conspiracy that brought down this self-appointed leader and then formed the Great Goblet. The goblet and its grisly contents were intended as a warning against treachery among the inner circle.
