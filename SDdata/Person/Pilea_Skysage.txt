'''Pilea Skysage''' was an [[elf]] [[sage]] who specialized in ''[[mythal]]s'' in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-MoMDtime}}
{{quote
|The Mythal did many different things when it was first created. It regulated the temperature, prevented tiny vermin from entering the city, and negated certain harmful spells.<br/>Yet powerful magics were unleashed during the [[Weeping War|vast battles]] with the [[Army of Darkness|monstrous hordes]] that destroyed the city. These damaged the Mythal, causing it to malfunction. Now zones of [[wild magic|wild]] and [[dead magic]] litter the city, [[portal]]s to other places open at random, and many of the Mythal's protections no longer function.
