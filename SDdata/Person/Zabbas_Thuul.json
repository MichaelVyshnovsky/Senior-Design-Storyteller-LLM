Among those he worked for were the [[Iron Ring]] slavers and the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] through Consul [[Orgin Ulmokina]] in their enclave in Skullport.\n\nThuul could usually be found in one of the rooms he continuously rented at the [[Blushing Nymph]] festhall in Waterdeep, or the [[Burning Troll inn|Burning Troll]] if conducting business in Skullport.",
