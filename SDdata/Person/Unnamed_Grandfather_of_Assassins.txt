An '''unnamed old man''' was the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] and leader of the [[Assassins Guild of the Galenas]] until [[1357 DR]].

==History==
The Grandfather allied with the [[lich]]-king of [[Vaasa]] [[Zhengyi]] and conspired with him to kill King [[Virdin]] of [[Damara]]. After the death of Virdin, he and his assassins slaughtered the most loyal and powerful nobles of Damara in a single night.

After the fall of the kingdom of [[Damara]], the Grandfather saw a perfect opportunity to gain direct power. So he gathered all the deserters, refugees, bullies, and other scum he could, forging them into a bandit army. With this army, he subjugated the [[Barony of Bloodstone]] until 1357 DR. When Baron [[Tranth]] rebelled, the Grandfather sent his entire army, because it was crucial for him to gain control of the [[Bloodstone Pass]]. He was planning to occupy [[Arcata]] next.
  
In 1357 DR, he was the leader of the main army that went to attack [[Bloodstone Village]].

After being defeated in that battle, he try to have vengeance, sending his best henchman, the [[Fist]], and a squad of assassins to kill [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s party.

At last, he plotted to send one of his minions, [[Cavil]], to be captured by the adventurers in order to lure Gareth's party into a trap. However, the Grandfather was killed when the monk [[Kane]] infiltrated his citadel.

==Personality==
The Grandfather was a cold and calculating individual, always trying to suppress emotions. He was normally cruel and aloof. The Grandfather cared nothing for the suffering of others and was interested only in power.

==Possessions===
This Grandfather of Assassins was known to fight with a ''+2 [[bastard sword]]'' and a ''[[dagger of venom]]'', to wear ''+3 [[leather armor]]'' and carry a ''+1 [[shield]]''. He also wore a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'' that contained a special ''[[word of recall]]'' triggered automatically in case of his death or capture that returned him to the Citadel of Assassins.
