'''Dunmore''' was the progenitor of the [[Voadkyn|wood giant]] race.

==Relatives==
Dunmore was the son of [[Ulutiu]] and [[Othea]], although [[Annam All-Father]] believed that Dunmore was his son until Othea's adultery was revealed to him. Dunmore had three other full brothers, each the progenitor of the other three main [[giant-kin]] races&mdash;the [[firbolg]]s, the [[verbeeg]]s, and the [[fomorian]]s. His half-brothers were [[Lanaxis]], [[Vilmos]], [[Nicias]], [[Masud]], [[Ottar]], [[Obadai]], [[Ruk]], [[Arno and Julian]], and [[Hartkiller]], who was the last born.

==History==
Like his half-brothers, Dunmore was born sometime around {{Yearlink|-30000}}. Dunmore's descendants became the [[voadkyn]] of later millennia.

Thousands of years later, one of the very first [[stormazîn]] discovered the fact that Dunmore was not a son of Annam. His wife had tricked Annam into believing that he was the father, so that she could have a spy among the [[True giant|Jotunbrud]].

After Ulutiu's amulet caused the [[Great Glacier]] and the [[Endless Ice Sea]] to form, the brothers collectively discovered a way to halt the amulet's magic; however, they were forbidden from doing so by their mother. Lanaxis, the leader, summoned them together for a meeting in [[Voninheim]] and planned to disobey his mother and have them stop the spread of the ice with their combined powers. Lanaxis was shocked when Dunmore refused to go along with the plan and violate their mother's wishes. but he accidentally poisoned not only Othea but also all of his brothers except Arno and Julian and Dunmore. What became of Dunmore after this is lost to history.

The "[[true giant]]s" considered Dunmore's descendants to be giant-kin, but the voadkyn themselves saw things differently, believing that Dunmore was indeed a true son of Annam and that the story of his parentage revealed by that early stormazîn was a lie.
