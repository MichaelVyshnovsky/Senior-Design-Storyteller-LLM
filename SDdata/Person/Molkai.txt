'''Molkai''' was a [[blightspawned]] [[volodni]] [[sorcerer]] in service to the [[talontar blightlord]] [[Gameliel]] in {{yearlink|1373}}.

==Powers==
Molkai threw a bolt of black, sorcerous lightning that was imbued with the power to cause rot.

==History==
While kidnapping [[Araluen]] and fighting [[Elowen]], his group came under attack by [[Marrec]] and [[Gunggari Ulmarra]]; Molkai warned them to leave, for his group required the Horned Aspect. After Marrec slew him by throwing [[Justlance]], one of his comrades believed the enemy cleric had disarmed himself in the process.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|28-29|4}}
