Apimu, whose name translated as "un-peaceful belly," was a skinworker of the reformed cannibal Kukalatu tribe of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
Apimu was a Nubari male who was known for his "we are doomed" attitude and mistrust of the outsiders. He was unhappy with the Council of the Almost Ancestors, never asking for his opinion but too afraid of the Eldest One to speak up against their judgment.
By The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, Apimu was a skilled skinworker who used garudaskin to craft quality sandals, belts, harnesses, and other similar items. Like leatherworkers of Faer√ªn, skinworkers of the Malatran Plateau did not use chemical processes to treat garuda skin, turning it into leather. Unlike many of his tribesmen, Apimu was afraid for the youth of the tribe who ventured to trade and interact with other tried of the Living Jungles. He was sure the neighboring communities still held a grudge against the Kukalaturis cannibalistic past. Then a group of heroes of the Living Jungle arrived at the Kukalatu Village, seeking a special medicinal ointment, Apimu offered the outsiders to trade. Apimus garudaskin sandals and Apimus garuda-foot arrow quiver were main masterfully items of note.
