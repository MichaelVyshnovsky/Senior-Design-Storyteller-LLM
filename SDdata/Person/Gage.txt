'''Gage''' was a [[thief]] from [[Laothkund]]. In winter of {{yearlink|1375}}, he sought the [[elven]] blade ''[[Angul]]'' at the [[Shadow Tongue]] lair in the city,{{cite book/Stardeep|19-29|2}} before departing with [[Kiril Duskmourn]] for [[Stardeep]].

==Description==
Gage was so wiry he was often thought to have [[wood elf]] stock.

==Personality==
Gage was witty and boisterous.{{cite book/Stardeep|56-57|6}}

He didn't consider himself evil, stealing mostly from the rich and the wicked, killing only those who were evil.{{cite book/Stardeep|110-121|10}} However, he didn't care for righting wrongs.

He was also inordinately tenacious, following Kiril even though she warned him not to on pain of death, even across the Yuirwood, Sildëyuir, and even the Underdungeon of Stardeep, all while staying hidden.

He was, however, genuine enough to recommend Kiril avoid restoring her bond to ''Angul''.{{cite book/Stardeep|304-308|29}}

==Abilities==
Per Kiril Duskmourn, Gage fought "like a wildcat", disabling foes quickly, even trained knights. He was also a sure-footed and excellent climber. Despite his differences with his [[Hands of Paymon|possessed glove]] and his poor treatment of it, he consistently got it to do what he wanted, even though he had to threaten the demon with acid sometimes.

==Possessions==
Gage made use of alchemical equipment such as [[alchemical sleep gas|inhalant]], [[alchemical light]]s and even [[explosive bulb]]s on occassion. He also knew of alchemically produced [[acid]]s, and wielded the ''[[Hands of Paymon]]'' between {{yearlink|1374}} and {{yearlink|1375}}.

==Activities==
While a thief, Gage mostly struck against the rich and the wicked. Those he killed, he considered evil.{{cite book/Stardeep|110-121|10}}

==Relationships==
He became close friends with Kiril during her passage through the tavern circuit of Laothkund.

In killing [[Stolsin]], the Grinder of Tribes, he acquired a bond which [[Sathra]] used to track him.

The demon bound to the [[Hands of Paymon]] often reminded Gage he'd eat his soul.

==History==
In winter of {{yearlink|1375}}, after having accompanied Kiril Duskmourn for some time in the city's tavern circuit,{{cite book/Stardeep|45-54|5}}

Next he struck a tavern, completely dominated by the sword he carried; it was only thanks to Kiril's intervention that the sword let him go Afterwards Gage said that Sathra had let slip that she been hired to take the blade by [[Nangulis]], in order to motivate Kiril to return to Stardeep..{{cite book/Stardeep|59-64|6}} Kiril came to explain her story,{{cite book/Stardeep|66-67|6}} and decided to head for Stardeep.{{cite book/Stardeep|72-73|6}}

While in the Yuirwood, Gage and Kiril were attacked by Sathra and a reanimated Stolsin. He quickly brushed aside the fact Sathra had not died once Kiril inquired.{{cite book/Stardeep|141}} When they arrived near Stardeep's [[Stardeep#Causeway|Causeway]], Gage uncovered some corpses using his glove; as Empyrean Knights rode out to meet Kiril, he attacked them and warned her that they were after her sword.{{cite book/Stardeep|143-149|12}} Though it saved her life, Kiril became suspicious of his motives;{{cite book/Stardeep|171-173|16}} Gage confessed to his true agenda.{{cite book/Stardeep|176-177|16}} When Kiril learned Gage had been hired to steal her blade, she parted ways with him; Gage decided to follow her anyway, from a distance, and hidden.{{cite book/Stardeep|179-181|16}}

Gage crossed the same portal Kiril had used, but was delayed in following by two [[nilshai]] attacking him.{{cite book/Stardeep|199-202|19}} He used the ''Hands of Paymon'' to track Kiril through Sildëyuir and into the [[Underdungeon]], where he was attacked by a [[stone spider]] and lost the enchanted glove after using an explosive to attack the spider, which loosed the demon. He took the opportunity to flee when the spider came back up to attack the demon.{{cite book/Stardeep|240-245|22}}

Eventually, he crossed the Empyrean Knights again.{{cite book/Stardeep|268-269|26}} Gage then caught up to the rearguard of the knights, and disabled one, taking his armor as disguise before catching up to the rest, just in time to be swept up in [[Raidon Kane]]'s teleportation into the [[Stardeep#Chamber of Observation|the Well]].{{cite book/Stardeep|283-284|27}}in Kiril's battle against Telarian, Gage managed to sneak behind the latter and deal the final blow.{{cite book/Stardeep|301|28}} After helping strike down the keeper, he revealed himself to Kiril, and they were back on good terms.
