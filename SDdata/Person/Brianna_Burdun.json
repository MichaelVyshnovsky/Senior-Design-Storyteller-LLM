Her face was striking, with clear skin, and she had long blonde hair.\nBrianna was a strong-minded and confident individual to the point of stubbornness about what she believed was right however, if someone showed an incontrovertible proof of her bad judgment, Brianna quickly admitted her mistake and apologized. She otherwise was easy to get along with.\nBrianna was intelligent and was very responsible about the rule of her kingdom.\nAs a follower of Hiatea, she was very serious about matters of childbirth and motherhood. She spent her time in that role counseling the people of her kingdom in matters of family affairs.\nBrianna could fight with battleaxe, longsword, or spear. She could hold her own as a fighter, although, as queen, she usually had an escort and supported them in any combat with her clerical spells.\nAs queen, she had access to any equipment she needed. She usually carried a few vials of holy water with her and wore her holy symbol, a metal carving of a flaming spear.\nBrianna was the only child of King Camden of Hartsvale.\nAs a princess, Brianna fell in love with a firbolg named Tavis Burdun, the owner of the Weary Giant. The two ended up adventuring together, and afterwards were married.\nBrianna had a son, Kaedlaw, which she bore after being raped by the father of all ettins, Arno and Julian,\nthumb|right|275px|The cover of the novel The Ogres Pact, showing Brianna as a prisoner of Goboka.\nBrianna was born into Hartsvales royal family. Her father, Camden, in order to win a succession war against his twin brother, allied with an ogre tribe and promised the hand of the yet unborn Brianna to the ogre chieftain. Brianna and most of the people of the vale knew nothing about this agreement. In 1366 DR, the ogre Goboka, who was a follower of the Twilight Spirit, arrived to collect his prize and, together with the king, organized a kidnapping to cover the kings involvement. Briannas father actively stopped all rescue attempts. Despite this, Tavis Burdun and his friends followed the princess and saved her.\nBack in Hartsvale, Brianna, having discovered her fathers actions, deposed him and became queen. Some time after this, the ettin Arno and Julain arrived, disguised as a human prince named Arlien, magically seduced and raped Brianna under orders of the Twilight Spirit. Arlien was discovered and defeated but not before impregnating her. Brianna escaped from the palace with only Tavis and the orphan Avner, pursued by many factions that wanted her unborn child. In the end, just after the childbirth, Tavis defeated the Twilight Spirit for good, freeing Brianna and her newborn son."
