        "mainbody": "'''Ogaki''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Korimori clan]] in [[Maeshi Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1360 DR]].",
        "History": "Ogaki was the second-in-command of [[Lord Korimori]]. In 1360 DR, he, together with his lieutenants [[Himeji]] and [[Sakigahara]], led a [[bushi]] army into a village formerly ruled by the [[Michimori clan]]. There, however, an adventuring party, hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to retrieve the [[Seven Swords]], fought and defeated his troops.",
        "Personality": "Ogaki preferred to observe a battle from a distance. He was careful of his safety, as he planned to receive the keep of Michimori after his lord's triumph."
