}}'''Sambryl''' was the regent queen of [[Impiltur]] throughout much of the 14{{th}} century DR.

==Description==
Sambryl was a skilled [[wizard]], who was often likened to her great-great-great-grandmother, Queen [[Sambral]].

==Relationships==
Sambryl was the oldest daughter of King [[Rilimbrar]] and Queen [[Ilbritha Eirlthaum|Ilbritha]]. Since the royal couple had no sons, Sambryl was forced to marry her second cousin, Prince Imphras IV, who was the next male heir to the throne. Theirs was a marriage in name only, and it was never consummated.

Her most trusted advisor was the [[paladin]] [[Kyrlraun]], head of the council known as the [[Lords of Imphras II]].

==History==
Sambryl married Imphras IV in [[1336 DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|71}}

When Imphras IV and Rilimbrar both died in a fire in [[1338 DR]], Sambryl became the regent for a line of boy kings, including [[Soarimbrar the Younger]], [[Imphras V]], and [[Imbrar II]]. 

In [[1357 DR]], the Witch-King [[Zhengyi]] of [[Vaasa]] conquered Impiltur's northern neighbor, [[Damara]], sparking concern among her subjects that Impiltur might be next. After the [[lich]] was defeated in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] two years later, Sambryl was secretly approached by Baron [[Dimian Ree]] of [[Morov]] to ask for her support in his bid to become the next King of [[Damara]]. She rejected his request on the advice of her advisors, who were increasingly supporting the bid of Baron [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]].

During the [[Rage of Dragons]] in [[1373 DR]], following the suggestion of the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]], she agreed to send a small contingent to the [[Gray Forest]] to destroy a [[Cult of the Dragon]] hideout.

In [[1374 DR]], Sambryl ended her regency when Imbrar II came of age.
