Sambryl was the regent queen of Impiltur throughout much of the 14 century DR.
Sambryl was a skilled wizard, who was often likened to her great-great-great-grandmother, Queen Sambral.
Sambryl was the oldest daughter of King Rilimbrar and Queen Ilbritha. Since the royal couple had no sons, Sambryl was forced to marry her second cousin, Prince Imphras IV, who was the next male heir to the throne. Theirs was a marriage in name only, and it was never consummated.
Her most trusted advisor was the paladin Kyrlraun, head of the council known as the Lords of Imphras II.
Sambryl married Imphras IV in 1336 DR.
When Imphras IV and Rilimbrar both died in a fire in 1338 DR, Sambryl became the regent for a line of boy kings, including Soarimbrar the Younger, Imphras V, and Imbrar II. 
In 1357 DR, the Witch-King Zhengyi of Vaasa conquered Impilturs northern neighbor, Damara, sparking concern among her subjects that Impiltur might be next. After the lich was defeated in the Bloodstone Wars two years later, Sambryl was secretly approached by Baron Dimian Ree of Morov to ask for her support in his bid to become the next King of Damara. She rejected his request on the advice of her advisors, who were increasingly supporting the bid of Baron Gareth Dragonsbane of Bloodstone.
During the Rage of Dragons in 1373 DR, following the suggestion of the avariel Taegan Nightwind, she agreed to send a small contingent to the Gray Forest to destroy a Cult of the Dragon hideout.
In 1374 DR, Sambryl ended her regency when Imbrar II came of age.
