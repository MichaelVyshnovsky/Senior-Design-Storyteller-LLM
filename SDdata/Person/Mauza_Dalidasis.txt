Mauza Dalidasis was an innkeeper inhabiting Kadarasto in 1367 DR.
Mauza was charming and personableâ€”truly rare traits for the citizens of the "City Most Sinister."
Mauza owned the Broken Wheel inn which, aside from the caravanserai found outside the city gates, was one of a few reputable places to rent a room in the entire city. She was a valuable source of information for anyone willing to spend the coin.
Mauzo was married to Cholk min Kado who owned the Shop of Faded Carpets.
