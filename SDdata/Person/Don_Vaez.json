        "mainbody": "'''Don Vaez''' was an adventurer who led [[Amn]]'s second expedition to [[Maztica]].",
        "History": "Vaez was from [[Calimshan]] and apprenticed with a thieves guild but was not a very good [[rogue]]. He later moved to Amn and became a mercenary.\n\n[[Cordell]]'s expedition had maintained some communication with Amn through Bishop [[Domincus]]' magic. The [[Council of Six]] became concerned when communication ceased after the bishop's death although the Council was not aware of the reason for the cessation of communication.\n\nVaez used the influence of a powerful noblewoman to gain a commission as leader of the second expedition. He set sail for Maztica in [[1362 DR]] with a fleet of 25 [[carrack]]s, 1,500 soldiers, and two dozen minor [[mage]]s. After arriving at [[Helmsport]], Vaez imprisoned the troops Cordell had left at the fort and set about trying to find the [[gold]] Cordell had buried somewhere in the area.\n\nSeveral months after Don Vaez arrived at Helmsport, Cordell returned with a small force. Vaez had Cordell and his men imprisoned and attempted to persuade Cordell to reveal the location of the buried gold. Shortly thereafter, [[Halloran]] arrived at the fort with a large contingent of soldiers. At the sight of the large number of soldiers outside the fort, Vaez's troops changed sides and Cordell had him arrested.",
        "Description": "Don Vaez was described as handsome with silver-blond hair."
