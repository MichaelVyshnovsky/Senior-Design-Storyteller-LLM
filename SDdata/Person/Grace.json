        "mainbody": "Grace was the half-orcish wife of Del. Both lived in an unnamed coastal village in northwest Faer√ªn in the late 15 century DR.\nGrace and Del had a favorite drinking buddy and friend named Feltin who lived in the same village when a mysterious \"haunted\" island just off the coast started luring villagers to it. Many disappeared, with Feltin following suit in the 1490s DR. Grace and her husband, by luck, came across Forge Fitzwilliam at a local tavern. Words of Forges recent heroic deeds spread wide, and the spouses approached him, seeking help. Forge eagerly invited Grace and Del to a northern town of Targos where he introduced the commoners to Edgin Darvis, and Holga Kilgore, his fellow \"heroes.\" Grace and Del offered their hard-earned coin as the reward for Feltins return. Eager to help, Edgins daughter Kira promised to help, much to the couples joy and happy hugs.\nSubsequently, it was revealed that the haunting was, in fact, a green hag who lured and devoured villagers. Edgins group found Feltins remains and returned the mans holy symbol of Chauntea. Grace and Del were angered at the \"adventurers\" bringing them dire news and the couple refused to pay the promised fee. They did not see Feltins body and thought the green hag story to be nothing but lies. Grace was ready to start throwing punches, but, eventually, both stormed away from Targos."
