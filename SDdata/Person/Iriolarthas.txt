'''Iriolarthas''' was the ruler of [[Ythryn]], a [[Netherese enclave|flying city]] of [[Netheril]]. A powerful [[arcanist]], he had transformed himself into a [[lich]] and still haunted the city's ruins as of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}.

==Description==
In his [[demilich]] form, all that remained of Iriolarthas was a floating [[human]] skull surrounded by wispy, [[magical]] symbols representing the eight [[schools of magic]].

His personal sigil was that of an eye with its pupil in the shape of a candle flame.

==Personality==
As of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Iriolarthas had well and truly lost his mind. He had lost the ability to communicate, even [[telepathy|telepathically]], and had no sense of how much time had passed since Ythryn's fall. He still awaited rescuers from Netheril, having no idea the empire had fallen thousands of years previously. Although Iriolarthas had only a dim recollection of events that had transpired, he still jealously guarded Ythryn's secrets from would-be looters.

==Abilities==
Iriolarthas was once an exceptionally powerful [[archmage]], but as his body deteriorated he eventually lost the ability to cast [[spell]]s.

==Possessions==
Iriolarthas's [[spellbook]], ''[[The Incantations of Iriolarthas]]'', contained a number of incredibly potent spells such as ''[[create magen]]'', ''[[demiplane (spell)|demiplane]]'', ''[[dominate monster]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[power word, stun]]'', ''[[blade of disaster]]'', and ''[[power word, kill]]''.

He owned a ''[[staff of power]]'' which he, among other things, used to power the [[Black Obelisk]] within Ythryn.

==Relationships==
Eight apprentices followed Iriolarthas on his expedition into the frozen north:

==Activities==
He spent much of his time in the [[Spire of Iriolarthas]], the central building of Ythryn.

==History==
Iriolarthas was once a regular [[human]] arcanist of Netheril, albeit one powerful enough to construct his own ''[[mythallar]]'' that powered his very own flying city. Even before Ythryn's eventual fall, Iriolarthas had transformed himself into a lich.

When a group of Ythryn arcanists known as the [[Telepathic Pentacle]] attempted to fuse their minds together, they accidentally melded their bodies and minds into a single horrifying monster. Ever pragmatic, Iriolarthas imprisoned the thing in a well so that his citizens could commune with it telepathically to gain insight into events past and future.

Iriolarthas sought relics of [[Ostoria]], a [[giant]] empire from distant antiquity known for its war against [[dragon]]s and for its command of powerful [[magic]]. By his command, the enclave of Ythryn flew to the frozen north of [[Faer√ªn]] to undertake a series of excavations for such relics. Iriolarthas's expedition found nothing of value for quite some time, until finally, in the {{YearlinkName|-343}}, they did. A mysterious stone spindle was recovered from the bottom of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] and brought back to Ythryn for study and experimentation. Unfortunately, during a routine examination the spindle was somehow activated, causing it to release a sudden burst of power that immediately dispelled all magical effects throughout the city, including the ''mythallar'' keeping Ythryn afloat.

The lich avoided the immediately ensuing calamity by escaping into a [[demiplane]] moments before Ythryn crashed into the [[Reghed Glacier]], entombing the entire city beneath the ice. However, the residual effects of the spindle's energy burst expelled him back into Ythryn only moments later. Iriolarthas immediately sought to recover his spellbook and [[phylactery]] from the now-ruined city, but could only find the former. He also found several of his apprentices and other citizens of Ythryn still alive. The spindle kept pulsing out spell-disrupting bursts of energy for the next fifty years, completely negating any use of magic to escape or restore the buried city.

Yet Iriolarthas did not give up. He and his apprentices kept trying to find a way to restore the ruined city. He knew that Ythryn's Black Obelisk could be used to turn back time and undo the city's destruction, Iriolarthas also created [[Everlast]], an artifical magical sentience, to help aid his efforts.

Inevitably, Iriolarthas's mind grew feeble over time and since he could not find his phylactery, he could not feed it the [[soul]]s needed to sustain his [[undead]] form. Eventually, his lich body disintegrated and he became a demilich. He spent the next eighteen centuries waiting for a rescue that never came.
