Beriand was a blind elder moon elf cleric of Mystra and one of the adventurers from Elven Court that answered the call to arms against the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR.
Beriand was an older elf, softly-spoken, and pious. He was selfless and ready to provide adventurers with healing.
As a cleric of Mystra, Beriand was a capable healer. His abilities were greatly enhanced via Deathbane, his powerful magical staff.
The sacred staff Deathbane was the main item of note in Beriands possession. The staff possessed powerful healing enchantments that the cleric of Mystra used to aid fellow adventurers opposing the Cult of the Dragon.
Beriand hailed from the enclave of Elven Court, not far from Myth Drannor. He was a well-loved and respected leader of a small group of worshipers of Mystra. Despite being blinded by magic earlier in life, Beriand dedicated his life to aiding magic-users and using the art for good causes.
In 1369 DR, Beriand received a vision from Mystra herself. Convinced that it was a mission from his goddess, Beriand joined the expedition to Myth Drannor, along with other adventurers who answered Elminsters call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins mythals and the Pools of Radiance to conquer the region. Beriand and Faeril, an elven fighter-cleric, along with a few others, arrived at the ruins from Elven Court.
Beriands group was ambushed by orcs and a fire-breathing creature who slaughtered most of the adventurers. Thankfully, Faeril managed to drag the bling cleric away from danger. Together, the two survivors found shelter in Stillwater Ruins, behind the protection of an elven word of power. Even though Beriand survived, the Deathbane staff was lost to the attackers. Faeril kept the blind cleric safe with her life.
Eventually, a group of adventurers from Phlan, later known as the Veiled Ones, arrived at the ruins to join the forces opposing the cult. Beriand requested their aid with recovering Deathbane, in exchange he provided them with the elven word of power that granted entrance to the Dwarven Dungeons underneath Myth Drannor, provided them with information on Elminsters hero Athans wetherbouts, and aided the heroes with his healing abilities.
The group from Phlan managed to recover the staff from the orc marauders and returned it to the blind cleric. Soon after, they secured the shine of Mystra in the ruins, prompting Faeril to join the heroes in their quest.
