On the other hand, she was not on good terms with the Knights of Samular, Algorind of Tyr, or Sir Gareth Cormaeril.\nBronwyn raised a girl named Cara, who was the daughter of Bronwyns estranged brother Dag Zoreth.\nAs a descendant of Samular, Bronwyn had in her possession one of the three rings of Samular. She also possessed a bag of sending that would transport items deposited into it back to her shop Curious Past.\nWhile growing up in Amn, Bronwyn was captured by the Zhentarim and became quite the skilled counterfeiter of jewelry and coins. After purchasing her freedom, Bronwyn started dealing in antiquities and was eventually recruited by the Harpers."
