She was captured by slavers and sold to the sultan of the [[Pearl Coast]] where she lived in his harim. She was eventually sold to a prince on the island of [[Harab]] but the ship carrying her was attacked en route by [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]]. The corsairs were then attacked by the [[ghoul]] pirates of Kaff and she was taken to Alim Baybars."
