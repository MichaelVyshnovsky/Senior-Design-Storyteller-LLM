Inglor Brathren was a member of the Zhentarim at Bargewright Inn during the late 15 century DR.
Inglor believed that Nalaskur Thaelond was lining his pockets at the expense of the Zhentarim. He also suspected that Chalaska Muruin was turning a blind eye to Nalaskurs skimming, but he feared Chalaska.
In 1491 DR, Inglor decided that both Chalaska and Nalaskur needed framing and replacing.
