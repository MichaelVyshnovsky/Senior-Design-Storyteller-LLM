Patrevani Onehand was the shaman of the Black Lion tribe of the Moonlands during the mid and late-14 century DR.
Shaman Onehand followed the old traditions of the Uthgardt people. He disagreed with the tribes chieftain, Andar Heartwood, about abandoning their nomadic lifestyle and settling in Beorunnas Well.
While groups spiritual leader during this transitional time, he was the only cleric who maintained veneration of the Black Lion totem or the deity Uthgar. The other Black Lion clerics took up worship of Helm, Tyr, Torm or Ilmater as was common in the North.
