'''Patrevani Onehand''' was the shaman of the [[Black Lion tribe]] of the [[Moonlands]] during the mid and late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Outlook==
Shaman Onehand followed the old traditions of the [[Uthgardt]] people. He disagreed with the tribe's chieftain, [[Andar Heartwood]], about abandoning their nomadic lifestyle and settling in [[Beorunna's Well]].

While group's spiritual leader during this transitional time, he was the only [[cleric]] who maintained veneration of the ''Black Lion'' totem or the deity [[Uthgar]]. The other Black Lion clerics took up worship of [[Helm]], [[Tyr]], [[Torm]] or [[Ilmater]] as was common in [[the North]].
