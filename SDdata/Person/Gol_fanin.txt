'''Gol'fanin''' was a [[drow]] [[warrior]] and former [[wizard]] who later became one of [[Menzoberranzan]]'s most accomplished weaponsmiths.

==History==
Gol'fanin traveled with the [[House Xorlarrin|Xorlarrin]] expedition to [[Gauntlgrym]] in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, alongside [[Tiago Baenre]]. Gol'fanin accompanied the expedition in order to gain access to the legendary forges of Gauntlgrym to produce powerful weapons.

A [[drow]] that may have been Gol'fanin was killed by [[Artemis Entreri]] in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, when Entreri threw him into [[Maegera]]'s pit.

==Possessions==
Gol'fanin carried with him a [[djinni]] bottle, a [[phase spider]], and an ancient [[sword]] design.

==Works==
Gol'fanin forged a number of powerful items, including:
* ''[[Vidrinath]]'', an enchanted [[sword]] forged at Gauntlgrym in 1463 DR for Tiago Baenre.
* ''[[Orbbcress]]'', an enchanted [[shield]] forged at Gauntlgrym in 1463 DR for Tiago Baenre.
* A fancy [[dagger]] carried by [[Ravel Xorlarrin]].

==Relationships==
[[Gromph Baenre]], the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], claimed that Gol'fanin was one of his oldest associates.
