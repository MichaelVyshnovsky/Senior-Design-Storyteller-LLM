Because of that it sent its agents, the Heralds of Hadar, to Toril to feed on living creatures in a desperate attempt to avert its demise.\nHadar was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it. Neogi were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars."
