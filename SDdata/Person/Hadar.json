        "History": "[[File:Herald of Hadar AFR.jpg|thumb|A Herald of Hadar.]]\nHadar and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the [[Eldest]].\n\nHadar was a dying star, slowly burning into annihilation. Because of that it sent its agents, the [[Herald of Hadar|Heralds of Hadar]], to [[Toril]] to feed on living creatures in a desperate attempt to avert its demise.\n\nHadar was usually sought out by some [[warlock]]s to make a pact with it. [[Neogi]] were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars.{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|48}}"
