        "mainbody": "'''Liara Portyr''' ({{Pronounce|lee|AR|ah|_|por|TEER|refs=}}) was a member of the [[Portyr]] [[patriar]] family, the commander of [[Fort Beluarian]] and the highest-ranking member of the [[Flaming Fist]] in [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She answered only to Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\n{{quote|Fear leads to order. Order leads to peace. This is your duty, no matter what Ulder Ravengard, Liara Portyr, or any other supposed \"bastion of justice\" might tell you.|Excerpt from ''[[Flaming Fist New Recruit Booklet]]''}}",
        "Personality": "Liara was a hard-hearted and dedicated leader who held high respect for militaristic order. She saw hardships as challenges for her to overcome.\n\nShe admired those who took up the adventuring life. She supported those who operated within her jurisdictional area of Chult and assisted them with overcoming obstacles they faced.",
        "History": "Liara was born to the well-off Portyr family of [[Baldur's Gate]],\n\nAt the age of forty-seven, she was assigned to the post of Fort Beluarian in Chult. During her command, she struck a deal with the [[pirate]]s of [[Jahaka Anchorage]], ensuring extra wealth for her and her soldiers, along with safe passage for Baldurian vessels.\n\nThree years into her command in Chult, the [[death curse]] afflicted [[Toril]].\n\nWhen Grand Duke Ravengard became trapped in [[Elturgard]] during the city's descent into [[Avernus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Liara Portyr was summoned back to Baldur's Gate to take the lead of the Flaming Fist. When the [[Cult of Bane]] and its secret leader Lord [[Enver Gortash]] was reaching for political power in the Gate, the cult targeted Liara and her uncle. Gortash planned to remove Dillard from his seat in favor of Liara with simple threats. She, in turn, was to be infected with an [[illithid]] tadpole that would enslave Liara to the [[Absolute]]. During the [[Absolute crisis]], Liara Portyr held the title of the Commander of the Flaming Fist Headquarters stationed in the [[Basilisk Gate]] barracks. During that time, Blaze Portyr dispatched investigators to tackle various crimes in the Gate, including sending investigator [[Valeria]] to a \"plague ship\" (case #612), a \"hand-taking murderer\" (case #655), the \"mortal injury to the [[waveservant]]\" (case #657). She supervised the investigation into the disappearance of [[Lora Bergauz]]'s seven-year-old daughter from the [[Blushing Mermaid]]. Liara uncovered a lead, but in the process, she was bewitched by the culprit â€“ the [[green hag]] named [[Auntie Ethel]]. Liara's mind was clouded and forced her to talk in circles as if completely forgetting anything related to the investigation or the missing child. If Auntie Ethel were to be successfully defeated, Liara would come to her senses, her mind clear, apart from headaches and a vague memory of a [[fey]]."
