'''Dabbledob Plasterpatch''' was a [[rock gnome]] from [[Gnomengarde]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was one of the tiny kingdom's foremost two inventors along with [[Fibblestib Pinebark]].

==Personality==
Dabbledob was argumentative, and preferred solutions to problems which addressed symptoms rather than root causes. She was also somewhat cowardly, and could become completely paralyzed by her fear.

==Abilities==
In addition to her innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Dabbledob (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]]. In combat, she preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.

Dabbletob was also skilled at creating [[magic]] items.

==Relationships==
Dabbledob was a close collaborator with Fibblestib. The two could argue about their very different ideas about how to solve problems, but they worked closely together in their workshop at Gnomengarde to create magic items and inventions, many of which served no real purpose.

As the most respected inventors in Gnomengarde, Dabbledob and Fibblestib were seen as reliable and trusted pillars of the community. In turn, both inventors were highly devoted to their kings, [[Gnerkli]] and [[Korboz]], but could be somewhat indifferent toward the well-being of other members of the kingdom.

==History==
When Gnomengarde's King Korboz went mad in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Dabbledob and Fibblestib made curing him their sole focus, even as the [[mimic]] responsible for his condition rampaged through the tiny kingdom. The two inventors quickly reached an impasse as Dabbledob dismissed Fibblestib's idea of inventing a ''[[sanity ray]]'' as "stupid" in favor of inventing a ''[[straitjacket]]''.

Not long after this incident, the town of [[Leilon]] asked Gnomengarde for aid, specifically for any magical items or weapons that could fend off a suspected attack by the [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]]. In response, the gnomish inventors created the ''[[Gnomengarde grenade]]'', a weapon suffused with [[wild magic]], and personally attempted to deliver it to Leilon's agents at a meeting point in [[Dumathoin's Gultch]]. Because of the item's instability, it was transported in two parts: Dabbledob carried a magical key which was used to arm the device, while Fibblestib carried the weapon itself. However, the [[necromancer]] [[Ularan Mortus]] sent [[undead]] to waylay the pair, who survived thanks to their escort, [[Bindlemint Mincemower]], fleeing to find the [[adventurer]]s from Leilon.
