        "mainbody": "Tracker Puli was a goblin  cultist of the Absolute who served her goddess at the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.\nPuli had yellow-brown skin and light brown hair. She wore stitched leather clothing and decorated her skin with pink body paint.\nBy all accounts, Puli would much rather be drinking and celebrating, rather than out on actual raids.\nIn battle, she fought with a crude wooden bow.\nIn the , cultists of the Absolute let a terrible raid upon  the Waukeens Rest inn. After their victory, they celebrated with a grand feast—complete with lots of ale—back at the Shattered Sanctum. It was not quite clear if Puli participated in the raid, but she was an enthusiastic reveler at the feast."
