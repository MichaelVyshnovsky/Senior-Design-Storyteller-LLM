        "mainbody": "Arklem Greeth () was a powerful human wizard and later lich and Archmage Arcane of the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAfter spending many years attempting to extend his lifespan with powerful spells such as wishes, Arklem Greeths body was eventually wracked with age.\nArklem had spent much of his very long life searching for the secrets of the greatest magic on Toril, going as far as Mulhorand and Thay, and even to Kara-Tur and Zakhara to delve into arcane lore. It was only in the mid-1300s DR that he came to believe one of his great knowledge and power had a destiny to also rule, and so he sought to extend his control over a significant part of Faerûn.\nAfter an attempted ambush in his bedchambers on the night of Eleint 14 in the  by his lieutenants Eldeluc and Valkebar, after theyd assassinated Arklems top lieutenant, the Wizard of Green Fire, Arklem fled the Host Tower. During this period Nyphithys the erinyes visited him and offered him the secrets of lichdom in exchange for the Arcane Brotherhoods conquest of the North—a deal which Arklem gladly agreed to. Following his transformation, a devastating clearing out of the Host Tower of the Arcane with the help of his new devilish allies began, setting Arklem back up as the undisputed master of the Arcane Brotherhood and Luskan itself.\nDuring his time as leader of the Arcane Brotherhood, he had a dragonborn apprentice named Morlanth. Arklem sent her to Neverwinter to bring back a necromantic artifact known as the Shroud of Souls, but she never returned.\nIn the , Captain Deudermont rallied an army against the Host Tower of the Arcane in response to Arklem Greeths funding of the piracy around Luskan. During the battle, Arklem slew Lord Brambleberry of Waterdeep and sent Drizzt DoUrden to the Abyss for awhile. He then detonated his staff in a cataclysmic release of energy, killing thousands and leaving the Host Tower in ruins.\nThe following spring, Arklem resurfaced when the High Captains of Luskan united to overthrow Deudermont. Seeking revenge on the captain who destroyed his hold over Luskan, Arklem attacked the Sea Sprite. Fortunately, Arklem was beaten in combat by Robillard, the wizard-protector of Sea Sprite.\nHowever, he was not destroyed and retreated to the graveyards of Luskan aided by mysterious allies where his beloved Valindra Shadowmantle had been returned to life as a lich."
