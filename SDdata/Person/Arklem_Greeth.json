During the battle, Arklem slew [[Brambleberry|Lord Brambleberry]] of [[Waterdeep]] and sent [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] to the [[Abyss]] for awhile. He then detonated his staff in a cataclysmic release of energy, killing thousands and leaving the Host Tower in ruins.\n\nThe following spring, Arklem resurfaced when the [[High Captains of Luskan]] united to overthrow Deudermont. Seeking revenge on the captain who destroyed his hold over Luskan, Arklem attacked the ''[[Sea Sprite]]''. Fortunately, Arklem was beaten in combat by [[Robillard]], the [[wizard]]-protector of ''Sea Sprite''.\n\nHowever, he was not destroyed and retreated to the graveyards of Luskan aided by mysterious [[Bregan D'aerthe|allies]] where his beloved [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] had been returned to life as a lich."
