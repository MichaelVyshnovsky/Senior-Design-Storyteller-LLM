Being a scribe, he took a vow of silence.\nPang was a young man, and as such was certain in his beliefs and biases alike. He favored northern Tabot over southern and the monasteries over the secular settlements.\nOn pilgrimage, he wore an orange loincloth and carried an ornate green and gold umbrella.\nCirca 2607, Abbot Mo Kin chose Pang to represent Pokarr Gompa in the great festival at the Temple of Heavens Heart on Mount Ekwong, releasing him from an eight-year-long vow of silence in the process. Pang was accompanied by five temple guards. While on the pilgrimage, he introduced himself to a representative from Shou Lung—in truth, the Dragon Lord Mei Lung—on the grounds that he looked \"important enough\" and asked to walk with him up the mountain. On the way, Pang told him much about Tabot, Regardless, Mei Lung later related Pangs account of Tabot to Elminster."
