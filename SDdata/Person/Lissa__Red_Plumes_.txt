'''Lissa''' was a member of the [[Red Plumes]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|11}}

==Activities==
Lissa was one of the soldiers assigned to the garrison in the [[Waydown]]. Secretly, she was also an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]].
 
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], a wizard named [[Olon]] disappeared inside the Waydown and the Lords' Alliance asked Lissa to investigate. Possibly, she gained the help of an adventuring party in disguise hired by [[Felratha]] and [[Arrizz]].

In the end, the adventurers discovered that Olon had been killed by some [[albino]] [[giant octopus]]es.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|22}}
