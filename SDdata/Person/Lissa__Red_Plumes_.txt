Lissa was a member of the Red Plumes in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Lissa was one of the soldiers assigned to the garrison in the Waydown. Secretly, she was also an agent of the Lords Alliance.
Circa 1486 DR, a wizard named Olon disappeared inside the Waydown and the Lords Alliance asked Lissa to investigate. Possibly, she gained the help of an adventuring party in disguise hired by Felratha and Arrizz.
In the end, the adventurers discovered that Olon had been killed by some albino giant octopuses.
