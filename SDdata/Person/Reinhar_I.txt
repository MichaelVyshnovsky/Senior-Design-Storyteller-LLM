'''Reinhar I''' was an [[Arkaiun]] warchief who rose to prominence in [[545 DR]] in [[Dambrath]].

==Activities==
Reinhar consolidated the might of the various tribes of Arkaiun inhabiting the barbarian kingdom of Dambrath.

He oversaw the enslavement of nearby [[Luiren]] and its [[halfling]] population. Reinhar continued his onslaught, eventually moving on to capture or destroy several coastal cities in [[Durpar]], before turning back to face the might of [[Halruaa]].

Reinhar assembled a force numbering 40,000, including a fleet of 50 ships, during his assault of Halruaa. The cities of [[Mithel]], [[Galdel]], and [[Zalasuu]] fell under his control.

He was eventually slain, along with most of his army, when they faced the magical might of [[Mycontil]] and his assembled archmages.
