Reinhar I was an Arkaiun warchief who rose to prominence in 545 DR in Dambrath.
Reinhar consolidated the might of the various tribes of Arkaiun inhabiting the barbarian kingdom of Dambrath.
He oversaw the enslavement of nearby Luiren and its halfling population. Reinhar continued his onslaught, eventually moving on to capture or destroy several coastal cities in Durpar, before turning back to face the might of Halruaa.
Reinhar assembled a force numbering 40,000, including a fleet of 50 ships, during his assault of Halruaa. The cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalasuu fell under his control.
He was eventually slain, along with most of his army, when they faced the magical might of Mycontil and his assembled archmages.
