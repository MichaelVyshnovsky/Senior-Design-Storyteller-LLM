'''Melisana''' was a [[human]] inhabitant of the island of [[Ventris]] in the [[Korinn Archipelago]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was the daughter of [[Melkeras]], a wealthy merchant and merchant guildmaster.

==Description==
At age 19, she was a brown-haired and blue-eyed.

She was also well on her way to becoming a good sailor and merchant. Although not violent by nature and tending to stay well away from conflict, the need to survive could prompt her to help her allies if they should require it.
