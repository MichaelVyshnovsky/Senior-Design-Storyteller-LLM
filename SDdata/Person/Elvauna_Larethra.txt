'''Elvauna Larethra''' was the matriarch of [[Milil]] who represented the Lord of Song throughout the late 14{{th}} and nearly all the 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. She served the [[church of Milil|Mililan faithful]] as high priestess of the [[Arbalest's House]] temple in [[Athkatla]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-05-31/Matriarch of Song}}

{{Quote|There is such a thing as a Song of Making, and it is truly glorious.|Matriarch Elvauna.}}

==Description==
She had the appearance of an alluring, middle-aged woman with a slim build. She had lean features and—during her mortal life―blue eyes that belied a sense of melancholy. Following her ascension as Milil's matriarch, Elvauna stood more tall, and her eyes shone with a radiance of pure joy.

==Personality==
Elvauna was considered an inspirational and kindhearted benefactor by her fellow faithful of Milil.

==Activities==
As matriarch, Elvauna focused her time on bolstering the morale of anyone who heard the music of the [[sorlyn]]. She ensured those petitioners had their spirits lifted and hearts comforted by Milil's eternal melody. She took personal interest in the affairs of the Lord's clergy and directly intervened in their troubles whenever possible.

According the matriarch herself, Milil revealed to her over time, clues that hinted at a grand undertaking that would call upon all sorlyn of the Realms.

==History==
In early autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1382}}, the previous Patriarch ascended to "join Milil's choir", and his body rose from the ground and faded into nothingness. That night, all of the Realms' sorlyn of appropriate influence, including all [[songmaster]]s, shared a dream of Milil playing his [[harp]] while seated atop a cloud illuminated by moonlight.

In a rush of exalted singing and with a crack of thunder, Milil himself appeared before then-Prioress Elvauna, and kissed her in a full embrace. He imbued within her a light from within his own divinity, and named her Matriarch of his entire church. In that moment she became the mortal leader of the Mililan faithful.

Matriarch Elvauna gathered her fellow sorlyn and made a brief visit to [[Waterdeep]], before continuing south via ''[[portal]]'' to Arbalest's House in Athkatla.
