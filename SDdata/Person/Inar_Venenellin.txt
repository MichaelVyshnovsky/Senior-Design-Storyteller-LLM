Inar Venenellin, also known as Pyrultimus, was one of the merchant-lords of Imdolphyn, and the leader of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond in the late years of the 15th century DR.
Inar was a human male of 50 years in 1480 DR. He was extremely lean, and perpetually sunburned.
As one of the merchant-lords, Inar had a high-ranking position in Imdarn society, advising Lord Othmeera Talask in matters of government. He also had a business in ship supplies and hiring of sailors and crew. He was well-liked and popular among the citizens of Imdolphyn.
This was a ruse, however, as his true goals were to awaken Achazar and use the power of the primordial to transcend mortality. To that end, he led the Cult of Reborn Flame under the alias of Pyrultimus, to achieve his goals.
In 1479 DR, Inar sent agents of the cult to different cities of the Windrise Ports to advance his agenda. Meanwhile, he began to develop a ritual on his own to awaken Achazar.
When a group of adventurers finally discovered his plot, they faced him in his finca in Ramekho, but they werent a match for him, and Inar fled. 
In 1480 DR, the adventurers led a group of powerful individuals of the Windrise Ports against him for a second time, and again were defeated. This time Inar cursed them with madness. Inar kidnapped Rathloff, a sage, and forced him to help to finish his ritual.
After the adventurers were healed, and after discovering that Inar was "Pyrultimus", the leader of the Cult of Reborn Flame, they launched an attack on his base of operations in Imdolphyn. This time, Inar was conducting his ritual and was about to awaken Achazar, but the adventurers were able to kill him before he could cast the ritual. With Inar dead, the Cult of Reborn Flame was destroyed for good.
