        "mainbody": "'''Veri Talvick''' was one of the neighbors of the ex-[[Harper]] [[thief]] named [[Edgin Darvis]] in the town of [[Targos]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Veri Talvick and her husband [[Jon Talvick|Jon]] lived next door to Edgin and were friends of his deceased wife [[Zia]]. When Ed was left alone with a newborn, the Talvicks happily babysat young [[Kira]]. Jon and Veri's nine-year-old daughter [[Miriam Talvick|Miriam]] adored the newborn and happily took care of her when Edgin needed help.\n\nVeri and her family babysat Kira when Edgin and his new friend [[Holga Kilgore]] embarked on their first heist – [[Pendro's Pawnshop]] in Targos. Nine years later, Jon and Veri's youngest child – [[Sief Talvick|Sief]], accompanied his father to the [[Trip and Shuffle]] tavern for dinner, while Veri and Miriam kept an eye on Kira. To the family's horror, Sief was grabbed by a band of robbing marauding [[gnoll]]s and left Jon hurt with a broken ankle.\n\nEdgin, Holga, and their new thieving ally – [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], set out to find the marauders and recover the group's stolen [[gold]], unaware of a kidnapped child. After a wild fight and cunning use of hungry [[stirges]], Sief was rescued and returned to the Talvicks. The deed made Edgin and his crew Targos' heroes."
