'''Cedric Exeltis''' was the member of the noble [[Exeltis]] merchant clan to bring them wealth and power through trade, several generations before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Cedric Exeltis was renowned as the first man to develop the recipe for the rare and expensive [[Exeltis Ice Wine]] â€“ a rich and potent red wine fermented using a unique type of tiny, fragile grey grapes that grew in the vineries around the [[Blade Cliffs]] region of the [[Sword Coast]]. Cedric's creation brought impressive wealth and status to the family for many generations until it all was gambled away by murderous [[Feldran Exeltis]], by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.
