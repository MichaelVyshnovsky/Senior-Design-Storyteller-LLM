Kurash was a lizardfolk of the Sharptooth tribe in the Vast Swamp of Cormyr in the early 1370s DR.
In early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Kurash was among a group of Sharptooths captured by Shadowscales and held prisoner in the tower of the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp, along with chieftain Gathan, Ashala, Gruss, and Sithen. The ordeal left them weary and emaciated. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to Mystra investigating Sharran activities there.
