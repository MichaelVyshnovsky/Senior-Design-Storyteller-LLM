'''Kurash''' was a [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Sharptooth]] tribe in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
In early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Kurash was among a group of Sharptooths captured by [[Shadowscale]]s and held prisoner in the tower of the [[Lost Refuge]] in the Vast Swamp, along with chieftain [[Gathan]], [[Ashala]], [[Gruss]], and [[Sithen]]. The ordeal left them weary and emaciated. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating [[church of Shar|Sharran]] activities there.
