        "mainbody": "nata Eller was a wizard sage specializing in the Outer Planes in the Vilhon Reach in 1358 DR.\nInata studied under her second cousin, Gustofsen Eller, probably the most renowned planar expert in the Realms.\nIn 1358 DR, she was hired by a gathering of leaders of both Chondath and Turmish to discuss the menace of the arcanaloth Yrkhetep. She advised them that she had learned from a vision that Yrkhetep was building a doomsday device called the Infinity Train and that it must be destroyed. (In truth, the vision was granted by Anthraxus.)\nInata then guided the Iron Legion to Hades for the last battle with Yrkhetep.\nInata was well known for her integrity. However, she was shy and naive."
