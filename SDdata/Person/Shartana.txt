Shartana was a human woman of the city of Calaunt in the Vast in the mid–14th century DR and a member of the Shadowcloaks thieves guild.
Shartana was tall with green eyes and jet black hair. She had a soft voice described as "venomous".
As a Shadowcloak, Shartana possessed the shadowcloak that all members wore.
When the Shadowcloaks ambushed, pursued and finally trapped Andreas Vanderslyke and Honus in a room, Shartana was there with dozen Shadowcloaks. Shartana conducted a mock trial for the renegade thief Honus and Andreas too. Andreas recognized Shartana and knew her to be a member of the Shadowcloaks.
