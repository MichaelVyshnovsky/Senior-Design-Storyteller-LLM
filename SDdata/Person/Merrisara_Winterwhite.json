Some of them were consumed with seeking revenge against those that plundered their ruined home and focused on little else.\nMerrisara had a strong-willed lieutenant in Olirien Mistcrown, an eladrin who called for extreme violence to be taken against those creatures that befouled what remained of ancient Sharandar. While his rhetoric made the situation more difficult for Merrisara, he remained a loyal ally unlike elven officers.\nSome time after the Spellplague in the , the Iliyanbruen elves led by Merrisara formed New Sharandar, on either side of the Fey Crossing, the portal that connected the Neverwinter Wood to the Feywild. They reclaimed the ruins of Old Sharandar, the former capital of their once great home, and slew the dark fey that despoiled the land.\nNew Sharandar faced a grave threat circa the , when the fomorian giant-king Malabog launched his war of conquest from his personal realm in the Feydark. Merrisara sent an emissary to the great city of Neverwinter, requesting aid from the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge and the Neverwinter Guard. She worked with the hero to help restore the destruction caused to New Sharandar by Malabogs dark fey minions, defeat some of the kings most malevolent allies, and finally scatter his army in a decisive battle in his own castle."
