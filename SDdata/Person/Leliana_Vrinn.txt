'''Leliana Vrinn''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Eilistraee]], a protector of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] and the mother of [[Rowaan Vrinn]], the head priestess of the [[Misty Forest]] shrine.

Along with the other followers of Eilistraee and drow of [[Miyeritar]]i descent without [[Wendonai]]'s taint, she was transformed into a [[dark elf]] during [[Flamerule]] in the {{YearlinkName|1379}} by [[Q'arlynd Melarn]]'s [[High Magic]] and the grace of Eilistraee. Grief-stricken about the death of Eilistraee at the hands of [[Halisstra Melarn]], she killed the Lady Penitent with her (now silent) singing sword.
