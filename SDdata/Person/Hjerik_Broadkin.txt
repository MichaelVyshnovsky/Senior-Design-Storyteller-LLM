'''Hjerik Broadkin''' was an inhabitant of [[Vanesci Hamlet]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]).

Hjerik was an upstart [[bloodforge]] mage. When the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] passed through the streets of Vanesci, Hjerik provoked them and publically challenged them to a bloodforge duel—it was common for such upstarts to challenge renowned bloodforge mages. Unable to ignore the challenge, they waged a bloodforge battle in and around Vanesci Hamlet.
