        "mainbody": "'''Myla''' was a [[winged kobold]] [[Kobold tinkerer|tinkerer]] in the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Myla had two brothers, [[Mek]] and [[Minn (kobold)|Minn]].\n\nMyla spent time with [[Laylee]], who was serving as her helper. Laylee once handled Myla's alchemical fire and caused an incident in the [[Dragon's Rest#Kitchen|cloister kitchen]]. Myla prohibited her from using it again.",
        "Activities": "Myla spent her time experimenting with [[Alchemist|alchemy]], [[engineering]], and [[magic]]. She often visited the [[Dragon's Rest#Library|cloister library]] and unlike most of the other kobold residents she was studious.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} Myla lived in the small [[Dragon's Rest#Monastic cells|monastic cell]] of the [[Dragon's Rest]] cloister cut into the cliff face. Her cell was cluttered with junk and tools. Just like all the other kobolds, she worked at night because of their sunlight sensitivity.\n\nOnce Myla, Mek and Minn were attacked by \"[[Stirge|hungry, icky, blood-sucking bat things]]\" and her wings were severely maimed. The brothers left her for dead. Later, the elder [[Runara]] aided her recovery."
