'''Camaris Highcastle''' was a slave who was imprisoned by a group of [[illithid]]s in [[the Underdark]] in [[1368 DR]].

==History==
He was part of a expedition that sought adventure in the Underdark, which lasted about a week. Here, Camaris and his fellows were surprised and captured by illithids near [[Ust Natha]] and forced to live as slaves. They were hooked to machines, where their mind power was used to create control circlets, which the mind flayers used to command their slaves.

The adventuring party of [[Gorion's Ward]] might have saved Camaris and his group from slavery.
