        "mainbody": "'''Redshadow''' was a legendary female [[dragon disciple]] who lived and died many years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Redshadow's legend was born after she slew a [[great wyrm]] in an epic battle in the skies over what then was called [[Dragonsfire Mountains]]. Some claimed that the dragon disciple was, in fact, the slain dragon's child. She used the creature's hide to stitch together a set of bulky [[enchanted]] ''[[great wyrm gauntlets]]''. Redshadow continued to wear these gauntlets until her own death, many years later."
