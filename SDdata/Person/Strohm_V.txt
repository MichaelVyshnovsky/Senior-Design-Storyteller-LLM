King Strohm V was a king of Tethyr and a famous druid, who became an oak tree when he died.
Strohm V was the second nephew and only heir of the previous king, Strohm IV. He had no sons but at least two daughters, the second who would become Queen Alisande.
Strohm V was born in the Year of the Rotting Orchard, 787 DR. He took the throne in the Year of the Patchworked Peace.
Legends say that when King Strohm V died, he changed into an oak tree. Since he had no sons, the Strohm Dynasty was ended. Tibor Mallorhen, the husband of Strohms oldest daughter became the first ruler of the short-lived Mallorhen Dynasty. Following the death of the second Mallorhen king, Tethyr would be ruled by four of Strohm Vs female descendants, a period of time known as the Queens Era.
