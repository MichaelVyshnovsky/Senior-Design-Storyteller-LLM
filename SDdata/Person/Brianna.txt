'''Brianna''' was a barmaid who worked in the [[Cracked Tankard]] tavern in the [[Crow's End]] district of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid-to-late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Brianna worked the tables of [[Relfin Tagorlad]]'s establishment alongside two other barmaids â€“ [[Ardanna]] and [[Torianne]]. They kept an eye on the suspicious customers and were useful to a group of the Living City adventurers, informing them of suspicious [[Zhentarim]]-type mercenaries who had recently been seen at the Tankard. Brianna also stated that the Crow's End district had been in decline of late, with many businesses closing due to the lack of city guard patrols.
