'''Durakh Haan''' was a devout [[cleric]] of [[Luthic]] who dwelled within the ruins of [[Citadel Rashemar]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
While she was clearly a [[half-orc]], exact specifics of her [[human]] and [[orc]]ish heritage was unknown.

==Personality==
She was known for her rather acidic personality.

==Abilities==
Durakh studied the practice of [[place magic]] under her mistress [[Chaul]], a malevolent [[durthan]] who ruled over the ruined citadel.

==Activities==
To aid the efforts of her warband, Durakh would ''[[raise dead|raise]]'' the fallen warriors and ''[[animate dead|animate]]'' the remains of their slain foes. She commanded her [[undead]] minions to stand guard over the citadel's inner domain.

==Relationships==
She was the most trusted ally of Chaul, serving as her chief lieutenant of the ''Warband of the Citadel''.
