Durakh Haan was a devout cleric of Luthic who dwelled within the ruins of Citadel Rashemar during the late 14 century DR.
While she was clearly a half-orc, exact specifics of her human and orcish heritage was unknown.
She was known for her rather acidic personality.
Durakh studied the practice of place magic under her mistress Chaul, a malevolent durthan who ruled over the ruined citadel.
To aid the efforts of her warband, Durakh would raise the fallen warriors and animate the remains of their slain foes. She commanded her undead minions to stand guard over the citadels inner domain.
She was the most trusted ally of Chaul, serving as her chief lieutenant of the Warband of the Citadel.
