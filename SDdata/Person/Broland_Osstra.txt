Broland Osstra was a young farmer that lived in Nightstone during the late 15 century DR.
He was known as an amiable and kindhearted individual.
Thelbin lived with grandmother, his mother, his uncle Brynn, and Brynns husband Thelbin.
The young man escaped disaster when cloud giants assailed Nightstone by dropping boulders from their cloud palace some time in the later 1480s DR. While his familys home was partially damaged, Thelbin and his uncles were fortunately unharmed.
To escape the falling rocks, many of Nightstones townspeople fled their homes and took refuge in a nearby network of caves. Brolands mother and grandmother were tragically killed when the refugees encountered a band of goblins within the caves.
