'''Broland Osstra''' was a young farmer that lived in [[Nightstone]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was known as an amiable and kindhearted individual.

==Relationships==
Thelbin lived with grandmother, his mother, his uncle [[Brynn Osstra|Brynn]], and Brynn's husband [[Thelbin Osstra|Thelbin]].

==History==
The young man escaped disaster when [[cloud giant]]s assailed Nightstone by dropping boulders from their [[cloud palace]] some time in the later 1480s [[DR]]. While his family's home was partially damaged, Thelbin and his uncles were fortunately unharmed.

To escape the falling rocks, many of Nightstone's townspeople fled their homes and took refuge in a nearby network of caves. Broland's mother and grandmother were tragically killed when the refugees encountered a band of [[goblin]]s within the caves.
