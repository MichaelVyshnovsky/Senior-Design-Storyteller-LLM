        "mainbody": "Pawnis was an adventuring elf helping the wizard Trifakas in his quest for Marteks Sphere of Power. Together with the wizard, they became stuck in the Garden of the Cursed until other adventurers arrived.\nPawnis dexterity was optimal for a thief.\nPawnis short sword and dagger had lost their drow magic in the desert, but he still wielded them. He wore a regular chainmail his outerwear, carefully sealed against sunlight, still acted as a cloak of elvenkind and boots of elvenkind. He only had two darts coated with drow poison left.\nThe drow saw that his best shot at leaving the tomb was with Trifakas and Sardok. He hid the suspicion, but he was certain that the wizard was withholding something.\nThe drow had arrived together with Trifakas and Sardok about one week before the adventurers who ultimately resurrected Martek did. He and Sardok were the last of Trifakas band the wizard decided to pose as an emissary of Grandal. The three discovered they were trapped soon after when new adventurers came bearing every Star Gem of Martek, both thieves in the band investigated these new arrivals. In Pawnis case, he also acted as an emissary and a greeter, to better gain the trust of new arrivals he may even have explained the curious religion of the guilders to them.\nIf Trifakas band managed to acquire the Star Gems, they may have proceeded with the trials of Martek. In such a case, he may have been found dead by the adventurers at the entrance of the treasury in the Inner Sanctum of Martek.\nPawnis believed that the key to the doors of Grandal had something to do with the three great stars of the guilder legend, as well as the Mound of the Lawgivers in the Garden of the Cursed. He did not know what a Star Gem of Martek was or did."
