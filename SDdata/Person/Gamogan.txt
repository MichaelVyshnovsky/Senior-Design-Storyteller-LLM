}}'''Gamogan''' was a kindly and wise [[star elf]] advisor to the nobility of [[Yuireshanyaar]]. He was popular among the people as a voice of moderation.

In the early days of the construction of [[Sildëyuir]], Gamogan was an outspoken opponent of the plan, claiming that it would strain those relations that had already been made with the [[human]]s and the existing allies of Yuireshanyaar.

He decided to contact the neighboring nations and tell them of the construction of Sildëyuir. Unfortunately, this information was used by a human tribe, who had falsely claimed to want an allegiance with the star elves, to attack an enclave, slaughtering all of its inhabitants and stealing tens of thousands of [[gold piece]]s worth of materials that were needed to create the [[portal]]s to Sildëyuir.

Gamogan, despite his good intentions, was banished from star elf lands and remembered by all as a vile traitor. His example was used by later star elves to always look to security before trusting in the good-will of strangers, which for the most part led to the star elves' insular standpoint.<ref>
