Alyn Farrago was a regular customer of The Lonesome Tankard Inn and Tavern in the town of Eveningstar, Cormyr, in the 15 century DR.
Alyn was a stout human man of middle age, light skin, and gray hair gathered in a ponytail.
In the 15 century DR, Alyn Farrago was a frequent customer and regular drunkard who told the stories of the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar to a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron, who ended up on Toril after falling through a rift. He told the heroes to travel to the Starwater Gorge and find an old stone door that opened into the ruins that once were used by the bandit lord Rivior. Alyn warned the group that, according to stories, Riviors ghost still haunted the ruins, which were filled with vermin and monsters, despite the famed Knights of Myth Drannor clearing the dungeon a century earlier.
