'''Alyn Farrago''' was a regular customer of [[The Lonesome Tankard Inn and Tavern]] in the town of [[Eveningstar]], [[Cormyr]], in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Alyn was a stout [[human]] man of middle age, light skin, and gray hair gathered in a ponytail.

==History==
In the 15{{th}} century DR, Alyn Farrago was a frequent customer and regular drunkard who told the stories of the [[Haunted Halls]] of Eveningstar to a band of [[adventurer]]s from the world of [[Eberron]], who ended up on [[Toril]] after falling through a rift. He told the heroes to travel to the [[Starwater Gorge]] and find an old stone door that opened into the ruins that once were used by the bandit lord [[Rivior]]. Alyn warned the group that, according to stories, Rivior's [[ghost]] still haunted the ruins, which were filled with vermin and monsters, despite the famed [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] clearing the dungeon a century earlier.
