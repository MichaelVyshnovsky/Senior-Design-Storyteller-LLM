'''Tamorlin''' was an [[elven]] adventurer who made a fateful excursion into the [[Watcher's Keep]], before being trapped within.

==Possessions==
During his time in the keep, Tamorlin kept a journal that detailed his efforts to map out the level he was stuck in.

==History==
When Tamorlin and his companions ventured into Watcher's Keep, nearly all of them were slain â€“ only Tamorlin survived. He managed to reach the maze-like third level but could not find his way out. Over time he slowly went insane, though not incurably so.
