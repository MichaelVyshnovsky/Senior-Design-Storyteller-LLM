'''Broargar "Windcloak" Iringil''' was a [[Impiltur]]an [[wizard]] and instructor of [[the Art]] who lived in the city of [[Lyrabar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

Iringil was the founder as well as one of the head teachers of the [[Towers of the Wind]], a well-known magical academy located within his home city. He was quite proud of the school he had established. Although it was regarded as rather small, compared to some other [[arcane]] institutions that were found throughout [[Faer√ªn]], it was considered the finer magical school of Impiltur.
