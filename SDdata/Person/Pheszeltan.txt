Pheszeltan was a great Hierophant Druid of Mielikki and later Silvanus who lived somewhere in the deep-most reaches of the Forgotten Forest in the North in the midâ€“14 century DR. 
Living in the densest part of the forest, his domain was said to be more difficult to reach than the highest peaks of the Graypeak Mountains. He spoke only to those who were able enough to reach him, but to the few who did, he would offer advice.
By 1367 DR, Pheszeltan had been using the Hill of Lost Souls to wield powerful weather magic.
