Imam Gogal was the High Priest of the Mosque of Kor the Old in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Gogal was a bit forgetful at times because of his age, but his mind remained sharp for important issues.
Gogal was blessed with supernatural wisdom from Kor, making him one of the great wise men of Huzuz. Though he was getting on in age, none of his subordinates thought of asking him to retire because of the respect he earned from them.
Gogal owned an aba of protection, necklace of prayer beads, and a flail of disruption.
