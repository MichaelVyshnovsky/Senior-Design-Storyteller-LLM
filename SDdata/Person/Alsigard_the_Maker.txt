Alsigard the Maker was a demilich who created golems on the Isle of the Maker in the Underdark from the 9 to the late 14 centuries DR.
While a living wizard, Alsigard became obsessed with the idea of creating a perfect being, one free of the weaknesses he saw in those around him. He retreated to a secluded island in the Underdark, where he began working on golems of various types, believing that they would be free of the weaknesses of the flesh. His work was highly advanced, with some of his creations attaining true sentience. However, he still perceived them as imperfect as they were made by an imperfect creator.
Approximately 500 years before 1372 DR, he abandoned his "children" and retreated to a lab deeper within the island. After 200 years without any contact, the golems unsuccessfully searched for him and eventually concluded that he had probably died. In fact, he had become a demilich to transcend the perceived physical and emotional weaknesses that he had previously been subject to.
In the , Drogan Drogansons pupil came to the island in search of allies against the Valsharesss attempted conquest of the Underdark and attacks on the surface world. After settling a dispute between two factions of sentient golems, the adventurer discovered the Makers deeper lab, where the demilich was close to completing an undisclosed plan. The Maker attacked and was destroyed in the subsequent battle.
