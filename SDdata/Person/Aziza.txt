Aziza was a seer who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Aziza was follower of Zann and an active member of the Readers. She ran a small shop called Books and Scrolls located in the Pilgrims District.
As a Reader, she collected books merely to have things to read, rarely giving the books subject matter more than a cursory glance before purchasing the volume. She was an accomplished mystic, charging the handsome sum of 125 dinars for a reading. If no vision came to her, she often created a broad telling that was open to the interpretation of the customer.
