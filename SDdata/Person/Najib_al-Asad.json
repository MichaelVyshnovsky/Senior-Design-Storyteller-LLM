He was considered by some to be the most powerful leader of all the desert tribes.\nNajib was a lean and hardened desert rider.\nNabil travelled to Tajar once a year for trade.\nNajibs wife, Alia al-Jamal umm Nabil, also served as his chief vizier. Najib cared so much for Alia that he willingly chose not to take other wives, though it was well within his right to do so. Najibs eldest son was Nabil bin Najib."
