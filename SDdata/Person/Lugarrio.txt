{{quote|''Flaming Fist have been afraid to take Keene on for years - and the Zhentarim did it in an afternoon. I think I picked the right side.''|Lugarrio}}

==Description==
Lugarrio was a halfling with tan skin, brown eyes, curly brown hair, and a trimmed beard. His was was decorated with war paint. He wore [[leather armor]] and wielded a blade.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lugarrio worked under ranking Zhents [[Roah Moonglow]] and [[Friol]], forging sticky alliances with [[the Guild]] and the [[Cult of the Absolute]] alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the [[Stone Lord]], so [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] rolled [[dice]] and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Lugarrio was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's [[Undercellar]]. Nine-Fingers, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Lugarrio's fate remained unconfirmed.
