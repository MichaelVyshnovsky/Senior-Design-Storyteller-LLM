        "Personality": "He was a caring husband to his wife [[Mayrina]] and would do anything to protect her and their unborn child.\n\nAccording to his wife, Connor was afraid of the dark.",
        "History": "He met his wife when they were both still children. She pushed over and made him laugh, Mayrina responded in kind and the two became fast friends. The two eventually married and conceived a child together.\n\nConnor died in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, leaving his wife alone and childless, with no money to her name. Desperate to bring Connor back from the dead, Mayrina lugged his lifeless body to the home of [[Auntie Ethel]] in the [[Sunlit Wetlands]] and offered their unborn child for his return.\n\nIn preparation for their bargain, Ethel crafted the [[wand]] called ''[[Bitter Divorce]]'' using wound roots and clumps of what appeared to be his flesh and hair. The wand had one sole ability: to bring back Connor as an [[undead]] monstrosity."
