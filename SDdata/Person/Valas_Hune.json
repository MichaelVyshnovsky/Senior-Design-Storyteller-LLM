        "History": {
            "Early life": "Born into [[House Ozzl'Hune]], a merchant house in [[Menzoberranzan]], Valas spent his formative years engaged in the family business, organizing and escorting [[Underdark]] trading caravans. This job gave him ample opportunity to learn to fight and encouraged him to be cosmopolitan.\n\nIn the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], Valas and a dozen of his kin were escorting a caravan through the [[Labyrinth]] when they were attacked by a large group of [[minotaur]]s. Valas was the only survivor of the expedition, having escaped the carnage after the others were slain. Valas survived in the Labyrinth alone without supplies. He snuck his way past various monsters, navigating the winding tunnels until he found the refuge of [[House Jaelre]]. \n\nIn gratitude for their hospitality, Valas dedicated himself to defense of the drow house. It was there that he befriended a [[Vhaeraun]]ite [[cleric]] named [[Tzirik Jaelre]]. Eventually Valas decided to return to his family, acting as a guard for several caravans until he found his way back to Menzoberranzan. Once home, he learned that the loss of the caravan in the Labyrinth had left House Ozzl'Hune destitute, and that rivals had destroyed whatever remained. He immediately sought out the mercenary company Bregan D'aerthe. Valas impressed his new brothers with his skills in silence and bladework, and rapidly ascended as a high-ranking member of the mercenary group.\n\nValas was among the members of Bregan D'aerthe who ventured into the [[Citadel of Assassins]] within the [[Galena Mountains]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.",
            "The War of the Spider Queen": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Valas was hired by [[Triel Baenre]] to retrieve ambassador [[Faeryl Zauvirr]] and her retainers out of [[Ched Nasad]], who had snuck out of the city in disguise.\n\nThe group traveled to Ched Nasad, relying on Valas's abilities to direct them through the Underdark. Upon arriving in Ched Nasad, they became embroiled in a plot instigated by the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] to lay low the city. Ultimately, the city was destroyed and Quenthel's band―along with [[Halisstra Melarn]] and [[Danifae Yauntyrr]]—made it out just in time by escaping through a ''[[portal]]'' that led to the ruins of the [[Hlaungadath]] on the surface in [[Anauroch]].\n\nThe group eventually decided to consult with Tzirik Jaelre, the Vhaeraunite priest. However when they arrived, the group found that House Jaelre had apparently left for the surface. They took a ''portal'' from House Jaelre's holdings in the Labyrinth to the surface forest of [[Cormanthor]] and determined where House Jaelre was located. Upon their arrival, Tzirik offered his assistance only if they aided him in retrieving the ''[[Geildirion of Cimbar]]'' from a [[beholder]] lair. \n\nThey group recovered the magical tome, and Tzirik revealed that [[Lolth]] was still alive but that she was locked away in the [[Demonweb Pits]]. The group and Tzirik traveled via [[astral projection]] to the [[Abyss]]. Once there, Tzirik betrayed them and gated in the god Vhaeraun, who tried to destroy Lolth. Valas attacked Tzirik in an attempt to return the group to the [[Material Plane]], but was unsuccessful. In the end, Pharaun was able to have Jeggred, who had stayed behind, kill Tzirik's mortal body to return them to Cormanthor.\n\nThe group consulted a [[demon]] for information on how to return to the Abyss. They were led to [[Lake Thoroot]] in search of a demonic ''[[ship of chaos]]''. Valas plunged into the lake to scout the vessel, having been given water breathing abilities by [[Pharaun Mizzrym]]. However, he was captured by the [[aboleth]] [[Jooran]] of [[Zanhoriloch]]. The aberrant monstrosity transformed him into some water-breathing creature with webbed paws, gills, a fluked tail, no hair, and a slimy coating. The transformation however didn't prevent Valas from returning to the surface to make his report. Upon his return, Pharaun ''[[polymorph]]ed'' Valas back into the form of a drow, with slight changes in his appearance. However, as Pharaun warned him, his metamorphosis could potentially be dispelled.\n\nThe group eventually found the ''ship of chaos'' in the [[Lake of Shadows]]. While Pharaun prepared the ship, Valas and Danifae traveled to [[Sschindylryn]] to obtain supplies. When they returned, they found their expedition in tatters after an [[uridezu]] attack. Despite the loss, the group continued onward and flew the ''ship of chaos'' into the Abyss. After their arrival, they discovered that Lolth had moved the Demonweb Pits to another [[plane of existence]]. As took a ''portal'' from the temple they found in to the [[Astral Plane]]; Lolth returned to existence and granted power to her priestesses once again. Quenthel decided to lead the group straight to Lolth's new temple, but Valas determined that his capabilities―namely guiding the group through the Underdark―were no longer sufficient and that his contract was done. He teleported himself out of the Abyss and returned to Menzoberranzan.",
            "Return to Bregan D'aerthe": "{{Quote|There is little that escapes the notice of Valas Hune, my friend.|Jarlaxle Baenre.}}\nValas continued to work as a scout for Bregan D'aerthe over following decade. In the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, he accompanied [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] on a mission to the small, ruined town of [[Carradoon]]. There they encountered a mysterious, interplanar rift. Unable to close the ''portal'', they merely retreated back to their headquarters.\n\nHe continued to serve as one of Kimmuriel's top lieutenants throughout the 15{{th}} century DR. Valas even reunited with [[Jarlaxle]] for a time, during his famed excursion into [[Gauntlgrym]]. The flamboyant drow vowed to take back the service of the \"finest scout and thief\" he had ever known.",
            "Meeting his Grandfather's Killer": "{{Quote|I knew him better than he knew I knew him...|Zaknafein Do'Urden}}\nIn the [[1488 DR|Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR]], Valas Hune came face-to-face with [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]], the man who killed his grandfather. Having been enlisted to assist the long time friend of Jarlaxle in sending a message to [[House Hunzrin]], the two met near the sewers beneath [[Waterdeep]]. They exchanged tense words and though no blows were thrown, Zaknafein did indeed admit to ending [[Arathis Hune]] in that one's attempt on his own life.<ref>"
