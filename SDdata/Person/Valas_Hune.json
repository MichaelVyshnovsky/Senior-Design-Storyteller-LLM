        "mainbody": "Valas Hune was a pragmatic drow scout and member of Bregan Daerthe, who served throughout the 14 and 15 centuries DR. He was an famed and accomplished guide of the Underdark, who famously became involved in a quest to solve the mystery of the Silence of Lolth.\nValas was described as wiry and small, standing . Valas had amber eyes and a square jaw. He often appeared tense. His skin was scarred, particularly on his hands (although he noted that after being polymorphed, his scars were in different locations). \nHe generally wore a simple vest of chain mail over a spider silk shirt and dark breeches. Over that he wore a vest with numerous magical badges and tokens.\nHe was aged over 200 as of 1372 DR.\nHe seemed to know a little about everything, including constellations (such as one that resembled a crown). He was well traveled and had been to Ched Nasad a number of times, as well as many locations on the surface and even beyond to the Shadow Fringe and Shadow Deep. He was quiet and capable. He wanted to stay out of trouble with priestesses whenever possible. He was also referred to as \"dutiful.\"\nValas was also humble. He explicitly did not like the title \"master\", once stating that he was no ones master.\nIt was speculated by some that Valas was a Vhaeraunite traitor because of certain connections he maintained.\nValas was highly skilled at stealth and remaining concealed, giving him a large advantage in combat. Valas favored the use of his two kukris enchanted to produce lightning, which he used to hamstring, stab, and eviscerate his enemies. Valas also used a short bow with which he was highly proficient.\nValas had some ability to disable mundane traps. Though he had all of a drows magical talents He played sava well. He also mastered the ability to strike out against foes who had just suffered a wound from a melee combatant.\nValas carried a double-curved shortbow. His preferred melee weapons were his magical kukris that were supernaturally sharp and enchanted to produce electricity.\nValas wore a shirt of chain mail with a vest that was enchanted to give him great agility and balance. His belt had a steel buckle shaped like a rothe head. He wore a ring of speed, On his vest, he pinned a large number of magical trinkets he had gathered over the years. \nThese trinkets had various magical powers, although not all of them were enchanted. A few of his pendants (as of 1373 DR) were\n* A pin with a nine-pointed star that enabled him to teleport short distances four times before requiring recharging.\n* A brass ovoid badge that enabled a mirror image spell.\n* A lucky double-headed coin (actually a magical amulet).\n* A mithral chime pendant he used to unlock things (as the spell knock).\n* A brooch of illusion, crafted by svirfneblin, which provided subtle illusions. It appeared as a gray stone surrounded by little uncut gems..\n* An amulet shaped like a golden sun hung on a delicate golden chain around his neck. When kissed, it protected him from wraiths. It came from surface elves who worshiped Labelas Enoreth. He expended it during a wraith attack in 1372 DR, after which it became dull gray and was presumably useless.\n* A crystal that could detect invisibility.\n* An insignia of Bregan Daerthe and a cameo of deep green jade, which was worn upside down. When it was touched, Valas could convey messages to Bregan Daerthe.\nBorn into House OzzlHune, a merchant house in Menzoberranzan, Valas spent his formative years engaged in the family business, organizing and escorting Underdark trading caravans. This job gave him ample opportunity to learn to fight and encouraged him to be cosmopolitan.\nIn the late 13 century DR, Valas and a dozen of his kin were escorting a caravan through the Labyrinth when they were attacked by a large group of minotaurs. Valas was the only survivor of the expedition, having escaped the carnage after the others were slain. Valas survived in the Labyrinth alone without supplies. He snuck his way past various monsters, navigating the winding tunnels until he found the refuge of House Jaelre. \nIn gratitude for their hospitality, Valas dedicated himself to defense of the drow house. It was there that he befriended a Vhaeraunite cleric named Tzirik Jaelre. Eventually Valas decided to return to his family, acting as a guard for several caravans until he found his way back to Menzoberranzan. Once home, he learned that the loss of the caravan in the Labyrinth had left House OzzlHune destitute, and that rivals had destroyed whatever remained. He immediately sought out the mercenary company Bregan Daerthe. Valas impressed his new brothers with his skills in silence and bladework, and rapidly ascended as a high-ranking member of the mercenary group.\nValas was among the members of Bregan Daerthe who ventured into the Citadel of Assassins within the Galena Mountains, in the .\nIn the , Valas was hired by Triel Baenre to retrieve ambassador Faeryl Zauvirr and her retainers out of Ched Nasad, who had snuck out of the city in disguise.\nThe group traveled to Ched Nasad, relying on Valass abilities to direct them through the Underdark. Upon arriving in Ched Nasad, they became embroiled in a plot instigated by the Jaezred Chaulssin to lay low the city. Ultimately, the city was destroyed and Quenthels band―along with Halisstra Melarn and Danifae Yauntyrr—made it out just in time by escaping through a portal that led to the ruins of the Hlaungadath on the surface in Anauroch.\nThe group eventually decided to consult with Tzirik Jaelre, the Vhaeraunite priest. However when they arrived, the group found that House Jaelre had apparently left for the surface. They took a portal from House Jaelres holdings in the Labyrinth to the surface forest of Cormanthor and determined where House Jaelre was located. Upon their arrival, Tzirik offered his assistance only if they aided him in retrieving the Geildirion of Cimbar from a beholder lair. \nThey group recovered the magical tome, and Tzirik revealed that Lolth was still alive but that she was locked away in the Demonweb Pits. The group and Tzirik traveled via astral projection to the Abyss. Once there, Tzirik betrayed them and gated in the god Vhaeraun, who tried to destroy Lolth. Valas attacked Tzirik in an attempt to return the group to the Material Plane, but was unsuccessful. In the end, Pharaun was able to have Jeggred, who had stayed behind, kill Tziriks mortal body to return them to Cormanthor.\nThe group consulted a demon for information on how to return to the Abyss. They were led to Lake Thoroot in search of a demonic ship of chaos. Valas plunged into the lake to scout the vessel, having been given water breathing abilities by Pharaun Mizzrym. However, he was captured by the aboleth Jooran of Zanhoriloch. The aberrant monstrosity transformed him into some water-breathing creature with webbed paws, gills, a fluked tail, no hair, and a slimy coating. The transformation however didnt prevent Valas from returning to the surface to make his report. Upon his return, Pharaun polymorphed Valas back into the form of a drow, with slight changes in his appearance. However, as Pharaun warned him, his metamorphosis could potentially be dispelled.\nThe group eventually found the ship of chaos in the Lake of Shadows. While Pharaun prepared the ship, Valas and Danifae traveled to Sschindylryn to obtain supplies. When they returned, they found their expedition in tatters after an uridezu attack. Despite the loss, the group continued onward and flew the ship of chaos into the Abyss. After their arrival, they discovered that Lolth had moved the Demonweb Pits to another plane of existence. As took a portal from the temple they found in to the Astral Plane Lolth returned to existence and granted power to her priestesses once again. Quenthel decided to lead the group straight to Lolths new temple, but Valas determined that his capabilities―namely guiding the group through the Underdark―were no longer sufficient and that his contract was done. He teleported himself out of the Abyss and returned to Menzoberranzan.\nValas continued to work as a scout for Bregan Daerthe over following decade. In the , he accompanied Kimmuriel Oblodra on a mission to the small, ruined town of Carradoon. There they encountered a mysterious, interplanar rift. Unable to close the portal, they merely retreated back to their headquarters.\nHe continued to serve as one of Kimmuriels top lieutenants throughout the 15 century DR. Valas even reunited with Jarlaxle for a time, during his famed excursion into Gauntlgrym. The flamboyant drow vowed to take back the service of the \"finest scout and thief\" he had ever known.\nIn the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR, Valas Hune came face-to-face with Zaknafein DoUrden, the man who killed his grandfather. Having been enlisted to assist the long time friend of Jarlaxle in sending a message to House Hunzrin, the two met near the sewers beneath Waterdeep. They exchanged tense words and though no blows were thrown, Zaknafein did indeed admit to ending Arathis Hune in that ones attempt on his own life."
