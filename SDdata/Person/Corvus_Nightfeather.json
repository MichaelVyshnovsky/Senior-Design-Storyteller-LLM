        "mainbody": "'''Corvus Nightfeather''' was a [[kenku]] [[assassin]] and spy and the owner of Nightfeather's [[Circus of Wonders]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Corvus was trained at the [[Rookery of Tears]]. He ran the Circus of Wonders, a circus traveling through southern [[Faerûn]] for a number of years.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], he led the rescue of [[Marod el Arhapan]]'s heir, [[Cephas]], from enslavement on the [[Island of the Free]]. He took Cephas to [[Almraiven]], where one of his employers, [[Acham el Jhotos]], intended to enspell Cephas with deadly magic to kill Marod. When two members of the circus were abducted and taken to [[Calimport]], Corvus traveled with Cephas and other friends to attempt a rescue. Corvus was imprisoned by his other employer [[Shahrokh]] and stripped of all his magical items. Corvus escaped Calimport when Cephas destroyed Marod's palace and [[gladiator|gladiatorial]] arena.",
        "Activities": "In addition to his circus, Corvus earned his coin by acting as a spy for various factions in southern [[Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "Corvus had black feathers.",
        "Personality": "He seemed to have a soft spot for outcasts such as the [[goliath]] [[Tobin]].",
        "Abilities": "Corvus could ''[[shadowstep]]'' and mimic the voices and hand writing of other people.",
        "Possessions": "Corvus's most powerful [[magic]]al item was an extradimensional space he accessed through his chest feathers.  He possessed one of the two books necessary to complete the [[Ritual of Return]] to free [[Calim]] and [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] from their imprisonment."
