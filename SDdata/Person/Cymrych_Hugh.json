        "mainbody": "ymrych Hugh was the greatest hero in the known history of the Ffolk and the first of the High Kings of the Moonshae Isles. Cymrych was so important to the inhabitants of the Isles that his coronation marked the start of their calendar.\nCymrych Hugh assumed the throne of Corwell in the  after his father, King Callidyrr Hugh, was killed by trolls.\nDuring the , King Cymrych Hugh of Corwell united the Ffolk against Kazgoroth, a great beast who ravaged the Isles regularly. Although not killed, the beast was defeated and driven back to its den, where it would remain for centuries. Following this exploit he was crowned, on the 14 day of Eleint, as the first High King of the Isles. At that time, he named Christopher Riker to rule Corwell as regent.\nGrieving from the loss of his wife Allisynn, who died from wounds received during the battle, the High King had a palace built to house her body and a fabulous treasure. Caer Allisynn was built on a small island in the Strait of Alaron, which thanks to druidic magic was submerged permanently except for four days a year&mdashso that his queen could still enjoy the sunlight. He had another castle built, Caer Callidyrr, to serve as the seat of his power.\nOver the following years, Cymrych Hugh had five children three with his second wife before she died in childbirth and two with his third wife. He died during the , from complications linked to the wounds he received against Kazgoroth. His oldest son, Warren, was just 13 years old at the time, but took over the crown of High King. His other children married amongst various Moonshae royal families, and most of his children and grand-children took \"Cymrych\" as their family name. Within a couple of centuries, it became the name of every noble family in the Isles. Unfortunately and despite sharing a common name, the noble families were constantly squabbling and quarrelling. Centuries after his death, the descendants of Cymrych Hugh were defeated by northmen, and his crown and sword were lost until they resurfaced in the hands of Tristan Kendrick during the 14 century DR. \nCymrych Hugh possessed an enchanted silver sword, which he used in battle against Kazgoroth. Legends said that the sword had been blessed by the Earthmother herself.\nHis first son, who came to be known as Warren I, became High King following Cymrychs death and founded the Cymrych Dynasty of the Moonshaes. Cymrychs eldest daughter, Tamara, would go on to become High Queen after Warren, while his second son would come to rule after her as Carrig I."
