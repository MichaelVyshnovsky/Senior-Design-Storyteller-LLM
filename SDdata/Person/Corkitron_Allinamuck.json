        "mainbody": "Corkitron \"High-Roll\" Allinamuck was a halfling thief and a member of the adventuring company known as Halfling Inc.\nCorkitron chose both his first and last names for himself (his parents were actually named Burrows). He also went by the diminutive Corky.\nThe name High-Roll came from his trick of rolling dice for treasure, proclaiming \"High roll gets it!\" If the others agreed to such a deal, then he simply took what he wanted as his share regardless of the dice. After all, they did agree that \"High Roll\" would get it."
