        "mainbody": "'''Celerum the Black''' was a member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] of [[Luskan]] and the apprentice of [[Dendybar]] the Mottled in [[Targos]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Celerum had shared features with the barbarians of the north. He was tall and thin and {{SI|6'2\"|ft-in}}, with blond hair and blue eyes. He was often dressed in the finest black robes adorned with a jewel-inlaid golden belt.",
        "Personality": "Celerum was ambitious, arrogant, cold, and calculating. He was completely devoid of morals and would do anything to further his goals. As he had spent significant time impersonating [[Boswell Peddywinkle]], a friendly and outgoing man, Celerum had significant acting abilities.",
        "Relationships": "Celerum researched [[spell]]s for Dendybar the Mottled of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]]. He was well acquainted with Boswell C. Peddywinkle.",
        "History": "Under Dendybar's tutelage, Celerum was conducting spell research. He came across excerpts from the diary of [[Damien Morienus]], containing references to a powerful [[potion]], but they did not include a description of the process for making it. Being ambitious, Celerum delved into the archives of the Host Tower of the Arcane, discovering that Damien had a research tower somewhere in [[Icewind Dale]], where he was working on a recipe for [[lich]]dom, but mysteriously disappeared before completing it around [[1269 DR]], a period of Icewind Dale's history called [[Great Thaw|the Great Thaw]]. Celerum embarked on a quest to discover the accursed tower and the recipe. Celerum traveled throughout Icewind Dale with a friendly merchant, [[Boswell Peddywinkle]]. Celerum murdered Peddywinkle along the road and, using his ''[[hat of disguise]]'', had assumed the merchant's identity by [[1369 DR]].\n\nShortly after Celerum's quest started, [[Kaladar the Cruel]] his rival at the Host Tower learned about Damien's tower and hired assassins to finds it for him. Kaladar suspected that Celerum was impersonating someone."
