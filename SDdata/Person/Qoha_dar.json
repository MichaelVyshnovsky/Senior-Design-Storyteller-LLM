        "mainbody": "Qohadar was a human shair who lived in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nQohadar spent a great deal of time making sure she was always presentable for someone of her lofty station.\nQohadars pleasant personality was often hidden by her pretentious exterior facade.\nJoining the Magical Legion was Qohadars main goal.\nOriginally hailing from an affluent family in Muluk, Qohadar visited Huzuz on her pilgrimage and opted to stay in the City of Delights.\nThe shair was always attended by her gen, Ali, and a mamluk bodyguard named Farim, with whom she was infatuated. Due to past excursions, Qohadar had a healthy relationship with the jann, who answered her calls immediately.\nQohadar enjoyed flaunting her wealth by wearing embroidered robes, opal earrings, a garnet anklet, and by keeping a jeweled jambiya strapped to her waist. She also owned a staff enchanted with a continual light spell, a wand of magic missiles, a ring of fire resistance, a cloak of protection, and several magical scrolls."
