'''Starmara Dagohnlar''' was a wealthy merchant's wife in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Starmara was no longer attracted to her husband, the merchant [[Durexter Dagohnlar]], and at times considered his death. She had a broad network of contacts, good enough that she already knew on sight that Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar, two importers and underworld figures, were working with [[Harnrim Starangh]]. She didn't trust her servants one bit.

==History==
Starmara took [[Westgate]] as a place of safety, and had visited it at least once, a house-of-baths being familiar to her.

One night in the early spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Starmara and her husband were taken captive by [[Malakar Surth]] and [[Aumun Tholant Bezrar]].{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|107-109|7}}

Despite Starmara's pleadings, however, they were not rescued, and finally resorted to gnawing away at their bindings.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|111-114|7}} Bezrar escaped shortly after; by dawn, the two Dagohnlars were still cowering, almost certainly still bound, but Malakar also chose to flee rather than slay them.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|116-117|7}}

They were later found by the Guard; while giving a statement, she was rather displeased with her husband's caginess.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|135-136|8}}
