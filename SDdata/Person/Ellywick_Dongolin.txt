'''Ellywick Dongolin''' was the [[gnome|gnomish]] innkeeper of [[the Cracked Crown]] on [[Podol Plaza]] in [[Phlan]]{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|7}}

==Personality==
Ellywick was a very sentimental person, and she was fiercely maternal.

==Abilities==
Ellywick was phenomenally good at brewing and baking.

==Activities==
Besides her vocation as an innkeep, Ellywick also spent her time tinkering.

==Relationships==
During [[Vorgansharax]]'s reign over Phlan, Ellywick was part of a covert rebellion against his reign together with fellow local business owners [[Durnam Goblinkicker]], [[Grig Wyler]], and [[Tross]].

==History==
Ellywick inherited ownership of the Cracked Crown from her father.

When the [[green dragon]] Vorgansharax took Phlan in the late 1480s DR, Ellywick was among the business owners who covertly rebelled against his tyranny, at least partially motivated by her inn's drop in business under the dragon's reign. Drawing upon her tinkering skills, she created the rolling sleds used to travel the city's hidden tunnels by the Phlanite rebellion.{{Cite adventurers league/Escape from Phlan|13}}
