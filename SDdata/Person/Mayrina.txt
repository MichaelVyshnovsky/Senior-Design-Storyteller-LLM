'''Mayrina''' was a poor off woman from the [[Western Heartlands]] that made the unfortunate mistake of making a deal with an [[hag|evil creature]] of the [[fey]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Mayrina was a person of little means, who wanted a better life for her unborn child, full of opportunities that were beyond her abilities to provide.

She could not stand being indebted to others.

==Possessions==
She had a cherished locket inscribed with a stylized design of a heart.

==Relationships==
Growing up together as children, Mayrina fell in love and eventually married [[Connor Vinderblad]]. The couple managed to conceive before Connor's untimely death.

She had two brother [[Johl]] and [[Demir]], both of whom cared for her very much.

==History==
Mayrina experienced great elation and tragedy and loss in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. While Mayrina was delighted she became pregnant with Connor's child that year, she suffered heartbreak following his death a short time later.

Distraught over her loss and ill-equipped to raise a child alone, Mayrina fled from her brothers' care, wheel Connor's corpse in a barrow to the [[Sunlit Wetlands]], and struck a deal with the [[green hag]] named [[Auntie Ethel]]. Mayrina offered up her unborn child to Ethel and in exchange the old crone agreed to bring back Connor from the dead. Mayrina remained at Ethel's [[Riverside Teahouse]], gaining strength until she could give birth.
