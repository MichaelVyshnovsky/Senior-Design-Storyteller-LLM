'''Thamer''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and a co-owner of [[Transgate Industries]], who lived in [[Karsus Enclave]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
After the death of his parents [[Ocelot (Netherese)|Ocelot]] and [[Ytartia]], Thamer operated Transgate Industries alongside his siblings [[Acciajuoli]] and [[Shander]]. The trio managed to do extremely well in running the company, and found great success in the following years.
