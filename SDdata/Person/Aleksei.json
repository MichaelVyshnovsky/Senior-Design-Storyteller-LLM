        "mainbody": "'''Aleksei''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] in the [[Moonsea]] in [[1491 DR]].",
        "History": "Aleksei was the rotten son of a minor noble. Having a bad life with his parents, in [[1489 DR]] he left home and soon joined the water cultists. Aleksei acted as a pirate with fellow cultists until 1491 DR.\n\nIn that year, Aleksei's cell was ordered to attack [[Furgis Boltsmelter]]'s ship and take the [[elemental codex]]. However, an adventuring party hired by Furgis near [[Mulmaster]] as his bodyguards destroyed the cell and captured Aleksei.",
        "Personality": "Aleskei felt constantly oppressed in his home because his parents were completely ignorant to the troubles and tribulations of a teenager. In the Cult, his life was instead a flurry of worshiping, scuttling ships, and generally being a nuisance to local fisherman until recent times. Aleksei started to consider what it meant to be a cultist and was in search of an answer."
