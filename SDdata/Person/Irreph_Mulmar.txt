'''Irreph Mulmar''' was the [[High Constable]] of [[High Dale]] in [[1368 DR]], acting as the leader of and spokesperson for the [[Dale Council]]. He was considered a hero throughout the land.

==History==
In his youth, Irreph was a hero and an adventurer, the fame from which helped earn him the title of high constable in his later years. 

Around [[1358 DR]], Irreph was ousted from his position by a secret [[Zhent]] occupation army. Thanks to [[Elminster Aumar]] and the [[Rangers Three]], he led an insurrection that freed the dale.

He resumed his role only around 1368 under popular pressure.

==Relationship==
Irreph had a daughter, [[Ylyndaera Mulmar]].
