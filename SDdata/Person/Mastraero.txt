'''Mastraero''' was a mage from the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]].

Mastraero once played [[Chess (game)|chess]] with an unwashed sailor in [[The Salty Dog]] tavern in [[Ravens Bluff]]â€”and lost. In his rage, he turned every witness into a snail, but missed his opponent, who turned out to be Ambassador [[Carrague]] of Ravens Bluff. Carrague promptly restored everyone's proper forms, and they got their revenge, forcing Mastraero to consume 10 pounds (0.45 kilograms) of salt. Mastraero survived the experience, albeit in poor health.
