        "mainbody": "'''Kryonar''' was a [[white dragon]] [[dracolich]] who laired on [[Mount Nar]] in [[Narfell]]. He was slain by the [[Red Wizard]] [[Branimern Rythil]] sometime in the mid&ndash;15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Kryonar was murderous, paranoid, and territorial.",
        "Activities": "He was considered a renegade dracolich by the [[Cult of the Dragon]], or at least he believed this to be the case. He was constantly on the lookout for anyone exploring on Mount Nar as he assumed that any new arrivals were spies sent by the Cult to find him. He was known to kill any and all who attempted to scale the mountain or approach the ruins of [[Jastaath Castle]].",
        "Lair": "Kryonar laired in a frozen natural cavern on the north side of Mount Nar very close to Jastaath Castle. The entrance to his cavern was concealed by a glacier, and was only accessible via tunnels through the ice.",
        "History": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Kryonar's presence on Mount Nar had meant that no one in living memory had successfully made it to the top of the mountain and lived to tell the tale. The local [[Nars]] were so frightened of him that they avoided traveling up the mountain even if there had been no sign of him for decades.\n\nAt some point around or before the {{YearlinkName|1439}}, Kryonar was destroyed by the Red Wizard Branimern Rythil and her minions. Branimern  then proceeded to construct her own stronghold amidst the ruins of Jastaath Castle, and kept Kryonar's death a secret in order to use his terrible reputation to keep intruders away. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, despite the fact that nothing remained of the undead dragon, few Nars knew or even suspected that Kryonar was no more. By that time, his old lair had become home to Branimern's more monstrous minions, including [[cyclops]]es."
