        "mainbody": "'''Urko''' was a [[kobold]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].\n\nUrko was the leader of the kobolds who attacked [[Hilltop]] in [[1372 DR]] on orders from [[Tymofarrar]]. After being attacked by [[gnoll]]s, Urko and his men sought refuge in a nearby [[elf|elven]] crypt, only to find it infested with [[undead]] [[elf|elven]] warriors and giant [[spider]]s. Terrified, they barricaded themselves in an empty room, but were soon approached by an unnamed adventurer who wished to retrieve the [[Belpheron|mummy hand]] the kobolds had stolen from [[Drogan Droganson]].\n\n[[Yazka]] and [[Kipper]] were Urko's lieutenants.<ref>"
