'''Behrshimmer''' was an [[emerald dragon]] [[wyrm]] who lived in the [[Giant's Run Mountains]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
In her old age, Behrshimmer was somewhat lazy, but would get up to defend her allies.

==Activities==
Behrshimmer had long laired within the caldera and tunnels of the dormant [[Mount Dodild]], in the eastern reaches of the Giant's Run Mountains, high above the [[Lake of Snows]].

==Relationships==
Behrshimmer was an ally of [[Dove Falconhand]]. In addition to Dove, she would shelter and defend those who came to her in Dove's name against any beings who came looking for them, but only so long as those guests didn't leave her lair and refrained from trying to steal anything from her hoard.

==History==
She was known to still be alive after the [[Dracorage]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}.
