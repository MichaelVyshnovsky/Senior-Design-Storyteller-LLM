        "mainbody": "Private '''Vester Jessup''' was a [[Neverwinter|Neverwintan]] soldier stationed in the [[Leilon]] garrison in the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Vester was assigned to patrol the [[High Road]] along the [[Mere of Dead Men]] to the south of [[Leilon]].",
        "Relationships": "Vester was friends with townswoman [[Breltora Red-Eye]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], Vester and three other soldiers went missing while on a routine patrol along the Mere of Dead Men. They encountered [[lizardfolk]] tribe and mistook their presence for an attack. The lizardfolk, led by [[Hissain]], fought back and captured the four Leilon troops. They used the captives as bait to lure away a group of [[rot troll]]s that had previously driven the lizardfolk away.\n\nWhen Vester still didn't return after already being two days late, his friend Breltora Red-Eye began to worry. However, Vester's commander, Sergeant [[Hazz Yorrum]], did nothing to investigate the disappearance of the soldiers, so Breltora contacted a group of [[adventurers]]. When pressed by Breltora and the adventurers, Yorrum showed them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued Vester and the other three soldiers."
