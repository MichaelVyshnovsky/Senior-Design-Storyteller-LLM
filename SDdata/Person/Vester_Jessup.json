        "mainbody": "Private Vester Jessup was a Neverwintan soldier stationed in the Leilon garrison in the High Tower of Thalivar in the late 15 century DR.\nVester was assigned to patrol the High Road along the Mere of Dead Men to the south of Leilon.\nVester was friends with townswoman Breltora Red-Eye.\nCirca 1491 DR, Vester and three other soldiers went missing while on a routine patrol along the Mere of Dead Men. They encountered lizardfolk tribe and mistook their presence for an attack. The lizardfolk, led by Hissain, fought back and captured the four Leilon troops. They used the captives as bait to lure away a group of rot trolls that had previously driven the lizardfolk away.\nWhen Vester still didnt return after already being two days late, his friend Breltora Red-Eye began to worry. However, Vesters commander, Sergeant Hazz Yorrum, did nothing to investigate the disappearance of the soldiers, so Breltora contacted a group of adventurers. When pressed by Breltora and the adventurers, Yorrum showed them the patrol route on a map. The adventurers then rescued Vester and the other three soldiers."
