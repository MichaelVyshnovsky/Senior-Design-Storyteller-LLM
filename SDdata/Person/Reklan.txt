'''Reklan''' was a [[sorcerer]] guard who worked at the [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Reklan was a [[human]] man with facial [[tattoo]]s and light skin. He wore [[robe]]s typical for [[sorcerer]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Reklan was one of three enthralled sentries who stood guard of the entrance to the massive Szarr Palace – home of [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]] located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. On the day of the accession ritual, the palace's chamberlain [[Antwun Dufay‎]] ordered no visitor nor delivery to be allowed an entrance, promising a "reward" from Cazador upon the ritual's completion.
