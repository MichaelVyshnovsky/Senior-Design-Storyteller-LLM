Aldon Bargewright was a human ranger inhabiting the settlement of Bargewright Inn within the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Aldons brother, Feston Bargewright, was the innkeeper of The Bargewright Inn and founder and leader of the settlement.
Aldon led the militia of Bargewright Inn by 1358 DR and through the mid-1360s DR. These comprised five trained fighters (hostelers at the inn) and a score of shopkeepers all wielding pikes. He also served as the stablemaster at the inn. By 1370 DR, he had also succeeded his brother as chairman of the Council of Directors that managed the settlement.
He carried a +1 longsword, rumored by others to be enchanted.
