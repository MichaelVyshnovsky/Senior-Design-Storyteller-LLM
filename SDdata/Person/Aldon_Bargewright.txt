'''Aldon Bargewright''' was a [[human]] [[ranger]] inhabiting the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] within the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Aldon's brother, [[Feston Bargewright]], was the innkeeper of [[The Bargewright Inn]] and founder and leader of the settlement.

==Activities==
Aldon led the militia of Bargewright Inn by [[1358 DR]] and through the mid-1360s DR. These comprised five trained [[fighter]]s (hostelers at the inn) and a score of shopkeepers all wielding [[pike (weapon)|pikes]]. He also served as the stablemaster at the inn. By [[1370 DR]], he had also succeeded his brother as chairman of the Council of Directors that managed the settlement.

==Possessions==
He carried a ''+1 [[longsword]]'', rumored by others to be [[enchanted]].
