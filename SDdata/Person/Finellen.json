        "mainbody": "Finellen came from one of the dwarven groups who lived in Myrloch Vale.\nAs was the case with dwarven females, Finellen had a bristling beard that dropped past the beltline. She stood perhaps four feet tall, with a stocky body, short legs, and long arms. Her shoulders were broad and sturdy, and her legs ended in surprisingly large feet, protected by huge leather boots.\nFinellen was captured by firbolgs and was imprisoned alongside Keren Donnell. She was rescued by Tristan Kendrick and helped in their escape.\nA century after the Darkwalker War she was known to reside in Sarifal, leading a small group of cragwardens in defense of the ancient stronghold Highhome."
