        "Description": "As was the case with dwarven females, Finellen had a bristling beard that dropped past the beltline. She stood perhaps four feet tall, with a stocky body, short legs, and long arms. Her shoulders were broad and sturdy, and her legs ended in surprisingly large feet, protected by huge leather boots.{{Cite digital book/Darkwalker on Moonshae|2494}}",
        "History": "Finellen was captured by [[firbolg]]s and was imprisoned alongside [[Keren Donnell]]. She was rescued by [[Tristan Kendrick]] and helped in their escape.\n\nA century after the [[Darkwalker War]] she was known to reside in [[Sarifal]], leading a small group of [[cragwarden]]s in defense of the ancient stronghold [[Highhome]].{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|61}}"
