        "mainbody": "'''Rachel Arren''', born '''Rachel Wykos''', was a [[priest]]ess of [[Lliira]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rachel was a woman of medium height with waist-length reddish-brown hair, crystal-blue eyes, and an aquiline nose.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|''...a human with a halfling's energy, an elf's grace, a dwarf's tenacity, and an ogre's temper.''|Some comrade of Rachel, describing her personality.}}\n\nRachel was known to be an energetic, mercurial, and regularly cheerful person. She found pleasure in almost every aspect of life. However, she had no patience for liars or fools in her life.",
        "Possessions": "Back when she adventured, Rachel typically wore a red [[tabard]] over [[chainmail]] armor. In her life as a priest, she typically wore tight leather [[breeches]], a flowing [[tunic]], and boots made of [[deer|doeskin]]. When engaged in the act of dancing or praying, she wore a billowing, provocative [[robe]] over a skintight outfit of orange, red, and yellow silk. \n\nOutside of clothing, Rachel owned a ''[[ring of warmth]]'' and three [[potion of healing|potions of extra-healing]].",
        "Activities": "After taking up residence in the [[Temple of Good Cheer]], Rachel spent much of her time teaching the art of dancing to both the young and old inhabitants of Waterdeep in return for donations. She was especially known to tutor young noblewomen.",
        "Relationships": "Rachel was good friends with [[Vhonna Deepdell]], [[Madame Garah]], [[Jeryth Phaulkon]], and [[Lauhren]].\n\nFollowing her retirement from adventuring, Rachel still kept in contact with her teammate [[Travis Deepdell]].",
        "History": "Rachel Wykos was born in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in [[1343 DR]]. Four years later she moved to the city of Waterdeep with her parents. Growing up she was full of energy and joy, but had a single-mindedness that often got her in trouble with the city guards. She began to show promise in the art of dance at a young age.\n\nAt the age of seventeen Rachel met a beautiful, female [[spectral dancer]] in a [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] alley who kissed her and then proceeded to give her a [[bronze]] pendant stamped with the symbol of Lliira. She considered this a sign from the goddess herself and from that day onward dedicated herself to the Joybringer's service. Soon afterwards, she left Waterdeep with a love-struck boy named [[Rett]] and the adventuring company [[Knights of the Sword Coast]].\n\nFollowing their deaths Rachel continued to adventure with the Knights of the Sword Coast, over time becoming an invaluable member. While adventuring she met and fell in love with a new member of the group, [[Arkiem Allen]]. When their group retired in Eleint of [[1366 DR]], she returned to Waterdeep with Arkiem and married him. With the money they saved up from adventuring to rent rooms in the Temple of Good Cheer in [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|South Ward]]. From that day onward they worked towards saving up their money so they could purchase the entire decrepit temple from its owner and repair it into a proper temple.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], she took a young woman named Lahren under her wing, teaching her Liira's blessings of self-worth and happiness. One day during prayer she was surprised when the young girl unwittingly cast ''[[light]]'', who then took it as a sign that she should go adventuring. Encouraging the girl's zest for adventure, Rachel gifted her a ''[[rope of entanglement]]'' and a set of ''[[bracers of defense]]''."
