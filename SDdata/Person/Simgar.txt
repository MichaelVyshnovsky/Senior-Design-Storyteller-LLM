'''Simgar''' was a commander of the [[Warswords]] who served as one of the [[Lords of Imphras II]], the council that presided over the kingdom of [[Impiltur]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}

==Description==
Along with his like-minded comrade [[Haelimbrar|War-Captain Haelimbrar]], Simgar was a veteran of the Impilturan army who had seen many battles throughout his illustrious military career. He did not care for the royal court, nor the diplomatic demands of lordship and abdicated his duties as advisor to [[Sambryl|Queen-Regent Sambryl]].

==Activities==
Lord Simgar spent much of his time away from the civilized lands of the [[Easting Coast]]. He preferred to spend his time leading the Warswords in small excursions against the neighboring [[orc]] and [[hobgoblin]] tribes or crusading against the [[fiend]]s that continuously appeared out of [[demoncyst]]s throughout [[Northeast Faerûn|their corner]] of [[Faerûn]].

==History==
Some time around the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Simgar led an expedition into the [[Giantspire Mountains]] of the [[Cold Lands]], investigating rumors of a [[Imbrar I|"dark knight"]] that had rallied a particularly strong horde of hobgoblin forces.
