Simgar was a commander of the Warswords who served as one of the Lords of Imphras II, the council that presided over the kingdom of Impiltur during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Along with his like-minded comrade War-Captain Haelimbrar, Simgar was a veteran of the Impilturan army who had seen many battles throughout his illustrious military career. He did not care for the royal court, nor the diplomatic demands of lordship and abdicated his duties as advisor to Queen-Regent Sambryl.
Lord Simgar spent much of his time away from the civilized lands of the Easting Coast. He preferred to spend his time leading the Warswords in small excursions against the neighboring orc and hobgoblin tribes or crusading against the fiends that continuously appeared out of demoncysts throughout their corner of Faer√ªn.
Some time around the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Simgar led an expedition into the Giantspire Mountains of the Cold Lands, investigating rumors of a "dark knight" that had rallied a particularly strong horde of hobgoblin forces.
