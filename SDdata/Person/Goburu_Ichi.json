However, he was killed by [[Ito Murasame]] and rose as an [[undead]] [[kuei]], waiting to possess a new body. In 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the Seven Swords met Ichi, who possibly decided to help them. Afterward, in any case, he went to the [[afterlife]]."
