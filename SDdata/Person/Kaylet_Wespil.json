        "mainbody": "'''Kaylet Wespil''' was the militia woman responsible for retrieval of [[the Army Banner of Daggerford]] during the [[Second Dragonspear War]] of [[1363 DR]].",
        "History": "Kaylet Wespil was a daughter of a well-known daredevil mercenary and hero. Unlike her father, Kaylet herself was known to be level-headed, avoiding recklessness and performing her duties but always avoiding unfavorable odds.\n\nKaylet Wespil was one of the militia members of Daggerford who, under the command of Duke Daggerford, participated in the Second Dragonspear War. After a defeat on the battlefield, the Duke's forces were pushed back to the city of Daggerford, as the [[orc]]s and [[devil]]s of Dragonspear captured the Army Banner of Daggerford militia and dragged it to [[Dragonspear Castle]]. The banner was raised on the tallest spire as a proud trophy. The loss of the banner affect Daggerford's morale, and the Duke knew that the loss of morale was deadly in the time of war. Kaylet Wespil stepped forward, volunteering for the suicide mission to Dragonspear Castle. With Duke's permission, she raced to her humble cottage several miles away from the city. There, she retrieved a small lockbox of her father's. Inside was a single item, an [[enchanted]] whistle.\n\nLater the same day, Kaylet Wespil walked into the Duke's tent, dragging the banner behind her. Speechless, the Duke could only murmur one word \"How?\". The militia woman pointed towards the tent's opening, where the Duke saw a powerful [[bronze dragon]] standing there to the awe of fellow militiamen. Kaylet called in a favor the great wyrm owed her father and on its back flew over the Castle, grabbing the Army Banner of Daggerford before the enemy forces could even notice. The Duke was so impressed, he commissioned the bronze dragon's aid in the upcoming battles against the hordes of Dragonspear."
