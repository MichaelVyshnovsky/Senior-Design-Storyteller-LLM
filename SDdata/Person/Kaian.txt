Kaian was an old Tsuyoi-no-kami monk in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Kaian commonly strode through the temple on one errand after another, talking with himself along the way.
Anchin and Kaian were temped by the young maiden O-Shino, acting under the orders of the monks Kogi and Bupposo of the Winter Sect temple, as part of a good prank.
Despite not being high-ranking or powerful, Kaian was respected by his fellows for his piety and dedication.
