'''Sheva Whitefeather''' was the ranking [[Wychlaran|witch]] of [[Mulsantir]]. She was one of the few [[Othlor]]s of that organization.

==Activities==
Sheva gave an adventurer the chance to fight for their life against [[Okku]] instead of simply allowing them to be sacrificed to save the city, allowing them to recruit followers from the Mulsantir jail.<ref>
