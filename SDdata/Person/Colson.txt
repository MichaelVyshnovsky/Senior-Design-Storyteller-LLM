Colson was the daughter of Meralda Ganderlay, Lady of Auckney, and Jaka Sculi, before becoming the adopted daughter of Wulfgar and Delly Curtie in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
In the , Meralda claimed that she was raped by Wulfgar and that Colson was his child, though in truth, it was the charismatic Jaka Sculi who had sired her shortly before Meralda was to be married. Feeling guilty, she helped Wulfgar escape the dungeons of Castle Auck.
Wulfgar, having discovered the reality of the childs heritage, came back to Auckney several months later to see what had become of Meralda and her child. Seeing that the childs life was in danger from a weak-willed lord and his bitter sister, Wulfgar rescued her, promising Meralda that he would treat her as his own.
Colson and Delly stayed at Captain Deudermonts house in Waterdeep while Wulfgar sailed with Deudermont in search of Aegis-fang that year.
When Colson was a toddler, Delly was killed after being compelled by the cursed sword Khazidhea to fight orcs. She had entrusted Colson to a refugee from Shallows named Cottie Cooperson, who took the girl from Mithral Hall to Silverymoon and then to Nesmé, where Cottie claimed her as her daughter. Cattie-brie and Wulfgar discovered her location and went to Nesmé to retrieve Colson. They succeeded, but Wulfgar had already decided to travel to Icewind Dale, a place where he would be unable to raise her. Instead, he took her back to Auckney where, after a brief confrontation with Lord Feringal Auck, Wulfgar left her to be raised by her real mother, Meralda, and Feringal.
In the , Catti-brie returned to Auckney to learn the fate of Wulfgars daughter. She learned that Lady Colson had borne two children, both of whom died before her and did not continue the line. Her reputation as a bastard child ("The Bastard Lady") and the fact that her supposed father was a barbarian was well-known by the townsfolk even at that time.
