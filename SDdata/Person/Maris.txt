'''Maris''' was a servant at the [[Journey's Rest]] in [[1369 DR]].

==History==
Along with [[Cora]], Maris worked at the Journey's Rest inn when it reopened in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, and they lived together in one of the upstairs rooms. They tended to the common room and the customers during the day, while the owners [[Ryanna]] and [[Moria]] worked during the night. They had no idea that their mistresses were actually a pair of predatory [[vampire]]s who fed on the customers, and were shocked when a party of [[adventurer]]s drove them off after being attacked one night.
