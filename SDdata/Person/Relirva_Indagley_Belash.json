        "History": "Relirva was a commoner and retainer of House Teh'kinrellz, trained as a scout. Serving under the weapon master [[Durdyn Teh'kinrellz]], she had the opportunity to study the [[chitine]] and [[choldrith]] of [[Yathchol]] and wrote a series of notes about their society and physiology. The Teh'kinrellz nobles approved when her information indirectly resulted in the death of the secondboy of a rival house. As a reward, Relirva was allowed to also work as a sage of chitine lore.",
        "Activities": "Relirva was employed by bored nobles who wanted to hunt chitine."
