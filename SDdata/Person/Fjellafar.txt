'''Fjellafar''' was a [[frost giant]] [[skald]] from [[Svardborg]] who lived centuries prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Fjellafar wrote sagas that continued to be sung far and wide by giants ''circa'' [[1356 DR]]. These chronicled centuries of victories and the challenges of living in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], such as what the area's frost giants hunted for among the ice during summer and winter.
