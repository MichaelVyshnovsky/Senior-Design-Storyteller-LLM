        "mainbody": "Prebek was an apprentice mage who lived in the city of Athkatla during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nPrebek served the Zhentarim necromancer alongside his fellow apprentice Sanasha under the apprenticeship of the mad necromancer Xzar.\nThe necromancer wore a mage robe of fire resistance and was armed with a simple dagger. He also carried two wands of magic missiles, a potion of insight and several spell scrolls.\nAs of the , Prebek, Sanasha, and Xzar were conducting magical experiments to create monsters that resembled goblins. Both young mages were jumpy and wary of intruders, apparently, at least on one occasion, Xzar sent intruders to Prebeks house in the Wave District as a test. The master was indeed a cruel man. Once, Xzar pulled three toenails off Prebeks foot for simply miscasting a cantrip. At the time they were being investigated by the Athkatlan branch of the Harpers. Prebek, Sanasha, and his \"creations\" may have been ordered killed by Harper Rylock."
