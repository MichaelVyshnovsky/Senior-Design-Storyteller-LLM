Claire was a courtesan who was enslaved by Lady Galvena.
Claire was to be married to a trader called Sanik, and they planned to elope. However, as her mistress, believed that Claire was her "property", she would not allow for this. Consequently, Claires husband-to-be was assassinated, and she was ordered to be tortured to death.
It was rumored that Claire, whilst undergoing torture and condemnation by Lady Galvena, was rescued by Gorions Ward. She was informed of Saniks death, and was deeply saddened. She sought safety under Saniks captain, Golin.
