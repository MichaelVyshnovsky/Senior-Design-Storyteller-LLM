'''Wyrruth''' was a male [[human]] [[shade]] and an [[enchanter]] who operated as an ambassador between the city of [[Shade]] and [[Maerimydra]].

==Description==
A dark grey complexion complemented his equally dark eyes and his black hair was kept pulled back in a long ponytail. Wyrruth was tall but gaunt for a [[human]] and sported a black goatee. Wyrruth's clothing appeared relatively old-fashioned; he wore a burgundy and black tunic with many layers and gold thread trim along the collar and sleeves. Over this was a weighty mantle of black with a burgundy lining.

==Personality==
An eloquent shade of stately comportment, Wyrruth was completely loyal to [[Thultanthar]] and would rather die than betray his people. As an ambassador, Wyrruth was very careful to avoid conflicts in most cases and maintained a diplomatic air throughout his conversations.

==Abilities==
Wyrruth was an adept negotiator and considered, by the leaders of [[Thultanthar]], to be capable enough to serve as the ambassador to [[Maerimydra]] where he would need to deal with the dangerous politics of drow society.

As a powerful [[enchanter]], his diplomatic skills were complemented by the numerous [[enchantment]] spells he had prepared. He often used ''[[sending]]'' spells to communicate with his higher-ups in Shade.

Wyrruth had been inducted into the higher mysteries of the [[Shadow Weave]] as a [[shadow adept]], which allowed him to augment his spells and abilities to great effect. Wyrruth had developed his understanding of the Shadow Weave to such a degree that he was able to summon a protective shield of shadows and even create a shadowy doppelganger of himself.

==Possessions==
In addition to the stately black and burgundy robes he wore, Wyrruth was outfitted with a set of ''[[bracers of armor]] +5'', and an ''[[amulet of natural armor]]'' +2. A lavender and green ''[[ioun stone]]'' orbited his head, which could absorb magic hurled at him. Furthermore, he armed himself with a ''[[wand]] of [[magic missile]]'' and a ''[[scroll]]'' of ''[[stoneskin]]''.

==Relationships==
Wyrruth was steadfast in his loyalty to the [[Empire of Shade]] and kept in regular contact with his superiors despite residing deep in the [[Underdark]]. While operating as the ambassador to Maerimydra, he kept a cordial relationship with the [[drow]] and was mostly interested in how the events in the drow city might affect the nearby city of Shade. To this end, Wyrruth maintained a neutral stance during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==History==
Trained in the arts of the [[enchanter]], Wyrruth was eventually noted for his capabilities as a negotiator. Soon after the [[City of Shade]] returned to [[Toril]], above the [[Anauroch]] desert, in [[1372 DR]], Wyrruth was among those selected to be sent throughout [[Faerun]] as an ambassador of [[Shade]]. He was sent by his superiors to operate as the ambassador to the nearby drow city of [[Maerimydra]], where he took residence in [[Castle Maerimydra]] with the ruling drow of [[House Ch√ªmavh]]. When the [[Silence of Lolth]] struck the Maerimydran drow and the forces of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] arrived in [[Eleint 23]], Wyrruth managed to keep out of the conflict and even managed to retain his ambassadorial position after [[Irae T'sarran]]'s cult of [[Kiaransalee]] took control of Castle Maerimydra. Wyrruth remained in the city to keep a close eye on the unfolding events and determine what, if any, impact they may have on the Empire of Shade.
