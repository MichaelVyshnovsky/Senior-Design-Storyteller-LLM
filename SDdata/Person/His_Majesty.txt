His Majesty was a cat who claimed the Last Light Inn as his royal abode during the late 15 century DR.
His Majesty was entirely hairless.
His Majesty was exceptionally haughty, even when compared to cats that claimed no royal heritage. 
He was also quite territorial the mere presence of others nearby inflicted upon him great personal harm. He would occasionally allow others nearby if only to briefly admire his beauty and grace.
He did not trust the Selûnite cleric Isobel. For once she promised him a saucer of of milk, and yet there remained no milk before His Majesty.
