Brialer Erkowe was a former adventurer who found a new life as an innkeeper in the city of Myth Drannor. He was the owner and proprietor of the Owl Towers inn, found in the Myth Drannan district of Dlabraddath.
Brialer was trained as an elven dualist and held the title of alurakar. As such his training offered him great skill with the Faer√ªnian schools of magic, abjuration and alteration. 12
He was still an adept caster after his injury, though it took him longer to cast his spells.
He traveled as an adventurer for some time until his final endeavor brought that life to a sudden end. Brialer lost his left hand during his final venture, though the exact story of the wound was unknown.
