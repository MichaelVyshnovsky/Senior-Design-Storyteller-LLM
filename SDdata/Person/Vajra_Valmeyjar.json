        "mainbody": "'''Vajra Valmeyjar''' was a female [[human]] [[fighter]] and a slave-warrior of the [[Arena of Blood]] in [[Manshaka]] in the 1350s [[DR]]. She famously escaped and went on to become an adventuress in [[Waterdeep]] and later even a duchess of the Kingdom of [[Tethyr]].{{Cite dragon/246/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Selûne's Smile}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Vajra - first appearance.jpg|thumb|left|Vajra in 1357 DR.]]\nVajra, a [[Tethyrian]] by birth, was a tall and powerfully built warrior, standing 6'1\" (1.85 m) high and being exceptionally muscular. She had pale-green eyes, brown skin, and blue-black hair. She kept her hair short, except for a long braid falling down to the small of her back, though she later grew her hair longer. However, as a starving child, she was rake-thin and small.\n\nShe still wore her gladiator's [[manacles]] from the [[Arena of Blood]], which proved useful in scaring any who would try to pick a fight with her. Even when she had become a noble of Tethyr, she changed her style of dress little, despite this bothering her courtiers substantially.",
        "Personality": "Vajra was exceedingly stubborn, which served her well on the battlefield but also irked some of her courtiers. She found it humorous that she ended up a duchess. She always strongly opposed injustice, especially slavery.\n\nAs an adventurer in 1357 DR, Vajra said she believed only in steel and a strong right hand. Her experiences of betrayal at a young age and fighting as a slave-gladiator hardened her heart, shutting out much personal pain, but also chances to feel love or joy. Her friend Luna worked to open her heart again.\n\nShe preferred not to talk about her past as a slave, except to make casual mention. As a free woman, she was determined never to be made a slave again, and would rather die than return to the arenas of Manshaka. She declared that Duum never broke her spirit.",
        "Abilities": "Vajra was an expert warrior, with a keen tactical sense and always organizing her fellows in battle and exhorting them to action.\n\nShe was amazingly strong, able to carry a dwarf and an armored knight as she scaled the sheer cliff of [[Stoner's Needle]].",
        "Possessions": "Vajra's sword was called \"[[Moonblaze]]\". It was crafted by [[Brian|Brian the Swordmaster]] of Waterdeep and directly enchanted by [[Selûne]] to protect Vajra in a battle she had with a [[tanar'ri]]. The blade was a cold-flaming [[longsword]] that was more powerful when wielded against [[outsiders]] and worshipers of [[Shar]]. The sword's strength depended on the current phase of the moon.\n\nThe slave manacle she wore on her right wrist was in the shape of a skull, the teeth of which could be used for cutting bonds. The manacle on her left wrist concealed a built-in dagger that could be extended for combat. Both manacles were gold.\n\nAs an adventurer in 1357 DR, she carried a [[longsword]], [[spear]], [[sling]], and [[net]], favoring the sword. She wore [[studded leather]] armor.",
        "Activities": "As royal warlord, Lady Valmeyjar was commander of the combined armed forces of all Tethyr.\n\nThe seat of Vajra's duchy was [[Maratimmir]], yet she spent the majority of her time at the royal palace of [[Faerntarn]] in [[Darromar]].",
        "Relationships": "Vajra considered Luna as her dearest friend.\n\nVajra's fellow adventurers [[Timoth Eyesbright]] and [[Onyx the Invincible]] remained her close friends, even traveling with her to Tethyr during and after the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]].\n\nMany a mother in Tethyr had pushed her sons to join the army, in hopes that they would be able to meet and woo the great Vajra Valmeyjar. This resulted in a large surge in the size of the army but in no duke-consort for Vajra.\n\nVajra was made an honorary member of the [[Order of the Silver Chalice]] by Marquise Scion [[Aalangama Gulderhorn]].",
        "History": {
            "Early Childhood": "[[File:Vajra - street kid.jpg|thumb|right|Young Vaji stealing bread to survive.]]\nVajra Valmeyjar was born in Tethyr but became an orphan early in [[Tethyrian Interregnum|its civil war]] (which began in [[Eleint]], [[1347 DR]]<ref>), when she was separated from her family. Orphaned and alone in a small market town gutted by conflict, \"Vaji\", as she was then known, lived on the streets, begging and stealing food to survive.",
            "Thief": "[[File:Vajra - training.jpg|thumb|left|Conner training Vaji as a thief and fighter.]]\n[[File:Vajra - sold!.jpg|thumb|right|Conner agreeing to sell Vaji to Abon Duum.]]\nAfter pinching a loaf of bread and fighting to keep it from other street-kids who tried to take it from her, she was found by a warrior, thief, and con-artist named [[Conner]]. He later claimed he'd been impressed by her spirit and determination. Taking Vaji under his wing, he fed her, cleaned her, trained her as a thief and cutpurse, and taught her to fight. She even learned to enjoy life again. Conner used young Vaji as a distraction for his stealing; for example, she would distract a shopkeeper by asking for a treat as Conner fished through the money-box.\n\nTogether, they later fled south to [[Calimshan]].\"[[Shackles of the Past]]\" (#13) describes Vajra as a thief and con-artist in Tethyr before going to Calimshan with Conner, but is contradicted by summaries of her early life in \"[[The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka]]\" (#2) and \"Rogue's Gallery: The Heroes of Selûne's Smile\" in [[Dragon magazine 246|''Dragon'' #246]], which state that the orphaned Vajra fled south to Calimshan and there met Conner and became a thief and con-artist. The former account is non-specific and was written before Vajra's early life was fleshed out in #13, while the latter appears to be a misreading of the story in #13. This article adopts the sequence of events in #13, as it is a clear and unambiguous flashback. There, Conner and Vaji ran confidence tricks in all the major cities: [[Memnon]], [[Teshburl]], [[Calimport]], and [[Keltar]]. In the great city of Calimport, they easily swindled small-time merchants and travelers out of modest amounts, then laid low in another part of the city. When the local authorities began to grow alert or suspicious, they moved on. In this way, they enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle, faced few serious risks and nothing life-threatening, and made it through a few escapades.\n\nFinally, the pair went to [[Manshaka]], where law was loose and guards and authorities corrupt, so Conner and Vaji felt safe enough to attempt grander and more profitable cons. Thus, Conner approached [[Pasha]] [[Abon Duum]] (in fact the tyrannical crime-lord ruler of Manshaka){{Cite comic/Cat & Mouse}} Thus, when Conner's scheme at last went wrong, he was forced to sell Vaji as a slave to Duum, so that he could go free, with their money. She was only twelve years of age at the time. For a long time, she blamed herself, fearing she had done something to make Conner dislike her, but afterward she would always hate him.",
            "Gladiator": "[[File:Vajra - gladiator.jpg|thumb|left|Vajra triumphant in the Arena of Blood.]]\nDuum placed young Vajra with his stable of gladiators at the Arena of Blood in Manshaka, where she learned the arts of the sword, spear, and net and honed her natural talent for combat.. She became the most accomplished of Duum's stable. She slew creatures such as a [[bugbear]] and a reptilian, and the crowds roared her name, but she never deigned to respond. However, she found steadfast companions in her fellow gladiators, such as [[Salabak]].\n\nHowever, after a decade,\"Rogue's Gallery: The Heroes of Selûne's Smile\" says Vajra was a gladiator \"for ten years\", but with the Tethyrian civil war beginning in 1347 DR and the comics' present day being 1357 DR, this leaves very little time for her prior career as a con-artist or her intervening career as a mercenary. It seems more likely this \"ten years\" is rounded up from 7, 8, or 9 years. she had had enough and wanted out. Escaping, she seriously wounded several of Duum's best fighters She left behind her fellow gladiators, and would for a long time fear they remained captives or had inevitably been killed.\n\nA wanted woman in Calimshan, Vajra fled north, back to Tethyr, fighting for a time as a mercenary in the civil wars. Later, she journeyed further north, serving as a bodyguard in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]]. However, Abon Duum sent bounty hunters after her, seeking to punish and reclaim his champion gladiator; his bounty was incredible but was only half if she was killed. Vajra was forced to leave the southern lands and go into the [[North]]. She ultimately came to [[Waterdeep]], where slavery was forbidden, and settled there. Over the years, many bounty hunters were sent to recover her, but she would escape from them all.",
            "Adventuress": "[[File:Vajra and Luna.jpg|thumb|left|Vajra meets with Luna again.]]\nIn Waterdeep, Vajra took work as a bouncer at a new inn, the [[Selûne's Smile]]. She became friends with its proprietress, [[Luna]], and developed a good working relationship. She fondly remembered its quiet but sociable and friendly atmosphere. Even after she left her employment, Vajra remained friends with Luna, who sometimes contacted her with unusual jobs that suited her abilities.",
            "The Reclamation Wars": "When [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Prince Haedrak]] and [[Perendra Raslemtar]] arrived in Waterdeep in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]] to gather support for the lost heir of Tethyr, Vajra and her friends Timoth and Onyx quickly joined up with the cause, even before Vajra learned that they would be supporting her old friend Zaranda Star.\n\nVajra, along with [[Perendra Raslemtar]], Onyx, and [[Ondul Jarduth]], was one of the adventurers who teleported into [[Myratma]] to sabotage that city and create a distraction for Haedrak to rescue Zaranda from the clutches of [[Safana Aldhanek]]. This proved a great help to the Loyalist army's efforts.\n\nBecause of her superb combat leadership in the last battles of the Reclamation Wars in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], she was granted the position of royal warlord and awarded the noble title of Duchess of [[Duchy Ankaram|Ankaram]]."
        },
        "Rumors": "When Pasha Abon Duum mysteriously vanished from Manshaka in [[1357 DR]], a popular rumor was that Vajra had returned to Manshaka and slain him for vengeance. In fact, she did not get the chance."
