In the late 15 century DR, Gromph Baenre, the drow Archmage of Menzoberranzan, successfully activated the Realm Engine in order to summon Lolth to the City of Spiders. Even though the summoning failed, Abyssal incursion of the Demonweb Pits began spilling into the Prime Material plane, threatening to swallow Menzoberranzan. Ahmatot the Shiny was one of the ranking Commanders who led the invading fiends into Narbondel and served Gromph Baenre.
