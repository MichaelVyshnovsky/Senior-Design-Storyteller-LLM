        "mainbody": "The Horned Mage was a mysterious ogre magi who briefly emerged in Amn in 661 DR to lead an army of ogres and monsters.\nHe was reputed to have had a +4 mithral shirt, later used by his \"successor\" Sothillis.\nThe Horned Mage came about in a period when the native ogres of Amn had been pushed back into the hills and mountains, reduced to small raids and skirmishes with border garrisons. Prince Imnel Torlath I led the army of the realm in the Ogre Wars, with his greatest victory at Imnels Scar. During this battle, he discovered the Armory of Nedeheim—a collection of powerful giant-crafted weapons hidden by the dwarves of High Shanatar. He had the collection moved to Athkatla and then Esmeltaran for storage in the royal vaults.\nThe Horned Mage traveled and explored the region over a century later, finding the dwarven journal Runes of the Wailing Dwarf, and Prince Imnels personal journal Imnels Scar A Personal History of the Ogre Wars. Using these sources, the Horned Mage determined the likely fate of the Armory of Nedeheim and put together a plan to seize it. Finally in 661 DR he made his move and led several tribes of ogres from the Cloud Peaks under cover of magic, and unified them with the ogres of the Small Teeth. With his ogres and other monsters, he suddenly swept down into the lowlands of Amn and sacked Imnescar and Trademeet. Before he could lay siege to Esmeltaran, King Rashturl Torlath assembled his forces and met the ogres in decisive battle, scattering them back to the hills. Of the Horned Mage, no sign was found of his fate.\nHis legacy was taken up by the ogre magi Sothilis, who found his secret lair in the Small Teeth and discovered his research. Sothilis then sought out the Armory of Nedeheim in the 14 century, leading ogres and other monsters to war and naming himself the Scion of the Horned Mage—an appellation that his troops approved of.\nAlthough the Horned Mage vanished with nary a trace, some suspected that he became a hooded pupil of Rysellan the Dark of Memnon."
