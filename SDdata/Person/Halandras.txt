Halandras was a kindly sellsword and blacksmith inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Halandras body was covered with a variety of tattoos.
He enjoyed leaving the forge behind in pursuit of a little adventure and coin.
An enchanted amulet was sewn under his skin somewhere that allowed him to use the word of recall spell. When used, the amulet immediately transported him to the temple of Lathander in Tulmon where he had access to healing potions and other useful magic.
