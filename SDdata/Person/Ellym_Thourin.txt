'''Ellym "Catsjaw" Thourin''' was a priest of [[Helm]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

Ellym once earned a reputation as an [[adventurer]], but later retired. Subsequently, Ellym rose through the clergy of Helm to become High Watchful Weaponmaster of the [[Noble Hand]] temple by [[1368 DR]]. Under Ellym's leadership, the temple—which also operated as a school for guards—thrived.
