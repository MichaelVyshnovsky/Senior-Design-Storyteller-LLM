Per his report, wounded nobles had been returned to their lodgings with an active listening spell on them. Of the spells, three had been abruptly broken, he believed, by hired mages, while the rest had not revealed anything of note.\nGlathra Barcantle told him to continue listening, especially for Lords Emmarask and Halvaeron. Shortly after his report, the Marchioness Immerdusk, Storm Silverhand, arrived accompanied by the mask dancer Amarune Whitewave and demanded to speak to King Foril Obarskyr I, who was in seclusion after the attempt on his life."
