        "mainbody": "Galaeron Nihmedu was an elven member of the Tomb Guard and shadow adept and a minor noble of Evereska. He played in the central role in the series of events known as the Return of the Archwizards, which saw the return of the phaerimm along with the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar to the Realms in the late 14 century DR, and the early re-emergence of the Netheril empire that would continue on for another century.\nGalaeron was tall and solidly built for a moon elf and had the pale skin and regal features common to his race. Two decades of serving as a Tomb Guard along the Desert Border South have left his face mildly rugged and weather-beaten.\nThe young elf experienced many struggles following his time as a member of the Tomb Guard. He felt tremendous guilt over the part he played in the release of the phaerimm. His strong sense of duty led him Galaeron to fix his mistake by whatever means he could, even if it meant submersing himself in the studies of dark shadow magic.\nGalaerons extensive use and overindulgence of Shadow Weave magic brought him into conflict with his shadow self – a manifestation of characteristics opposite his own – a being that was devoid of kindness and loyalty that resembled a vampiric drow. He gradually lost control over his emotions He even lost the inherent connection normally felt with the other elves in his family, along with the ability to enter into reverie.\nAfter an especially traumatic event, Galaeron was finally able to fulfill the promise to his friends that he would not longer tap into the Shadow Weave for his powers.\nGalaeron was skilled in both hand-to-hand combat and sorcery, having attended both academies of the College of Magic and Arms. unaware that this source of magic was controlled by the goddess Shar\nAlong with the personality changes Galaeron experienced due to his use of shadow magic, or \"cold magic\", he eventually lost his natural connection to the Weave. Galaeron became used to the sensation of coldness when utilizing the Shadow Weave, a sign he was that much closer to being consumed by his shadow self.\nGalaeron was the son of the moon elf Aubric Nihmedu, the Blademajor of the Swords of Evereska and Lord of Treetop in Starmeadow Tower. His mother was Lady Morgwais Nightmeadow, the wood elf ruler of Reitheillaethor in the High Forest. Galaeron had a younger sister named Keya, who was born in 1364 DR. A third Nihmedu sibling died in childbirth, an event that caused Morgwais to return to the High Forest in grief.\nWhile in his Tomb Guard, Galaerons life was made harder by Kiinyon Colbathin, Tomb Master and Master of the Defenses of Evereska, who was notably scornful of the younger elf. \nGalaeron was romantically involved with his fellow tomb guardian Takari Moonsnow, though the two held no formal commitment with one other. Their relationship became greatly strained as Galaeron became close with Vala Thorsdotter and delved deeper into shadow magic. Galaerons relationship with Vala was more intense and complicated than that he shared with Takari. They developed a close bond in short time, but scorn and jealousy kept them apart for much of their journeys, particularly after they encountered Prince Escanor Tanthul.\nIn his youth, Galaeron began to manifest magical abilities, including minor levitation, telekinesis and pyrotechnics. After seeking the advice of a wizard, Galaerons father enrolled him in the Evereskan Academy of Magic. As he was a sorcerer, Galaeron was often reprimanded in the academies for doing things in non-wizardly manner. After refusing to keep a spellbook, he was accused of practicing \"dark magic\" \nAubric managed to arrange a transfer for Galaeron to the Academy of Arms, where his skill with the blade quickly developed to rival that of his magical prowess. Although he excelled at the Academy of Arms and even earned a top rank, Galaerons discontent with authority learned in the Academy of Magic held him back.\nThrough the intervention of Lord Gervas Imesfor, Galaeron was granted a place in the Tomb Guard, the branch of the Evereskan military that guarded the elven crypts in the Evereska Vale and surrounding Greycloak Hills. Galaerons independent spirit was fostered and he was assigned as patrol leader to the Desert Border South, the region of the hills near Anauroch where he served for twenty years. \nOn Nightal 20, the , Galaeron led his patrol into the familial crypts of House Vyshaan and encountered a band of Vaasans led by Vala Thorsdotter and their beholder minion as they ventured towards the Sharn Wall. A small skirmish broke out between the elves and the human crypt-breakers, leading to a collision between Galaerons magic and the shadow magic wielded by Melegaunt Tanthul, the archmage sought out by the Vaasans. This intersection of two magics created an explosion that punctured a hole in the Sharn Wall, freeing the ancient, malevolent, and powerful race known as the phaerimm. \nGalaeron and his fellow tomb guardians escorted the humans back to Evereska, to report that had occurred to the citys Hill Elders. While the elven high mages failed at repairing the damage done to the Sharn Wall, Melegaunt led Galaeron, Vala and the Vaasan warriors on their own journey to stop the phaerimm. As more of the aberrant creatures escaped through the breach, they began gathering armies of bugbears, illithids, and beholders that they had enthralled through their mind magic. They companions traveled through the Shadow Fringe to the Forgotten Forest and then the Greypeak Mountains, where they were eventually accompanied by a little man named Malik el Sami yn Nasser and Aris, a stone giant sculptor whom Galaeron rescued from beholders serving the phaerimm.\nThe group made their way through the mountains to Reitheillaethor in the High Forest, and eventually to the ruins of Karse in the Dire Wood. There they encountered the tortured being known Jingleshod, who tasked them with killing the lich Wulgreth of Ascalhorn. The companions finally found the lich within the temple of Karsus and a terrible battle broke out. After receiving a mortal wound, Melegaunt imparted all of his knowledge of the phaerimm into Galaerons subconscious along with the fact he was the Twelfth Prince of Shade. Just before dawn on Hammer 1 of the , Galaeron used the Karsestone to create a gate that transported the ancient floating city of Thultanthar from the Plane of Shadow back to Toril.\nBy Mirtul of 1372 DR, Galaeron had relocated to Thultanthar along with Vala, Aris, and even Malik. With Melegaunts knowledge stored in his mind, Galaeron became a valuable asset to High Prince of Thultanthar, Telamont Tanthul. The two spent much time together. Telamont shared with Galaeron much about the Shadovars plans for Faerûn, while simultaneously manipulating him to retrieve Melegaunts lost lore. Eventually Galaeron lost complete control over his shadow self and grew detached from his new friends. Telamont offered to help him gain full use of his new powers, but Galaeron had enough with all the Princes of Shade and set out to leave Thultanthar. Both Malik and Vala refused to join Galaeron in his travels across Anauroch, but Aris and the Harper witch Ruha thought it be best for their survival.\nthumb|right|300px|Galaeron overtaken by his shadow while fighting atop the sands of Anauroch.\nDuring their travels across the desert, Galaeron reached a moment of crisis when his callousness led to a near-death experience for the gentle giant Aris at the hands of a blue dragon.\nOn Mirtul 21, Galaeron, Aris, and Ruha arrived in the city of Arabel, Ariss fame as an artist granted them a quick introduction to the Mage Royal Vangerdahast and Princess Alusair Obarskyr, Regent of Cormyr. Prince Rivalen Tanthul arrived shortly later, accusing the trio of theft, demanding they be rescinded back into the custody of Thultanthar. During their stay overnight in the Citadel, Rivalen and his Shadovar attempted to free Galaeron and his companions, with the aim of brining them back to High Prince Telamont. Alusair and her retinue anticipated this move and intercepted the Shadovar before they could leave. and Alusair commanded her Purple Dragons to kill several of the Shadovar. War between Cormyr and Thultanthar was set into motion.\nWhen it became apparent the the Shadovar army would strike back at Cormyr at Tilverton, Galaeron helped Vangerdahast with a magical device, a floating rune-covered orb composed of raw magic that negated the Shadovars unique magic. During the fighting they encountered Prince Rivalen opening a rift to the Plane of Shadow, that released fissures of shadowstuff throughout the city. Working together, Galaeron and Vangerdahast managed to defeat the Prince in a brief spellduel, and cast whatever was left of his shadowy remains into the rift. When Vangerdahasts orb sunk into the blanket of shadowstuff that covered Tilverton, a massive explosion erupted. In the end, the nearly the entire city was leveled, and the Shadovar army was defeated.\nWith the help of Khelben Arunsun, Laeral Silverhand, Alustriel Silverhand, Dove Falconhand, Storm Silverhand, and Aris, Galaeron managed to rescue Vala from Prince Escanor and deal a major blow to Shade Enclave. Also, during his imprisonment by Telamont, Galaeron joined with his shadow, filling in the gaps of his character and making him more whole while still being able to keep his will as his own.\nWhen Galaeron arrived back in Evereska, he helped the high mages repair the mythal, which had been unraveled by a phaerimm SpellGather. This inadvertently added something new to the mythal after the golden meteors descended to blast apart the phaerimm, streaks of shadow were left in their wake.\nDue to his fathers death while fighting the phaerimm, Galaeron inherited his lordship. For his great exploits, Galaeron was offered the position of Master of the Defenses by Lord Erlan Duirsar but he turned it down, choosing instead to travel with Vala to her home, the Granite Tower, in Vaasa, along with his spirit-deep mate, the wood elf Takari Moonsnow."
