        "History": "In [[1360 DR]], after the [[Immil Dale|Battle of Immil Dale]], Zofia deemed Fyodor a ''nydeshka'' (\"blunt sword,\" meaning he was dangerous to others), but rather than sending him to his death, she gave him the quest to return the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]] amulet to Rashemen.",
        "Relationships": "Zofia had a twin sister, [[Zhanna]]. who bore the [[Mask of Danigar]] and who was killed at the [[Watchtower]] by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] in [[1360 DR]].\n\nZofia's eldest son was [[Mahryon]], who was killed at the Battle of Immil Dale. His son was [[Fyodor]], who was thus Zofia's own grandson.\n\nZofia had been acquainted with [[Sylune]], Witch of Shadowdale, before her passing."
