She tried to approach all people who had knowledge about Undermountains structure and purchased for generous amounts maps of yet-unexplored sections of the dungeon. Ruudi also sold maps of the Yawning Portal, Waterdeeps streets, and all the public fountains in each of the citys wards.\nRuudi arrived at the Yawning Portal in only 1479 DR.\nRuudi claimed to be related to Clan Melairkyn.\nRuudi had a kind of map mania people joked that she used a map even to to to the privy. She was friendly, enthusiastic, and generous with anyone who wanted to speak about maps or Undermountain-related topics but was truly uninterested about other topics.\nCategoryDwarves\nCategoryInhabitants of the Castle Ward of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryCartographers\n2a7o5cx9fxrygjvf4k8mig1kbhy8oai"
