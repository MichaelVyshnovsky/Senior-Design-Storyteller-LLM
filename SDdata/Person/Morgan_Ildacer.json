        "Personality": "Morgan was an ill-tempered and over-arrogant elf. He respected only power and martial skills. So, inside the Council, he was influenced only by [[Nalos]] and the [[shalarin]] [[Ri'ola'kirk]].",
        "Activities": "Despite Morgan's objections, Myth Nantar was garrisoned also with troops from other [[Selu'Maraar]]'s military units."
