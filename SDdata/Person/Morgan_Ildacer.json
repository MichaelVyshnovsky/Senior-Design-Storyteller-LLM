        "mainbody": "Morgan Ildacer was the aquatic elf captain of the High Mages guard in Sylkiir and a member of the Nantarn Council.\nMorgan was an ill-tempered and over-arrogant elf. He respected only power and martial skills. So, inside the Council, he was influenced only by Nalos and the shalarin Riolakirk.\nDespite Morgans objections, Myth Nantar was garrisoned also with troops from other SeluMaraars military units."
