'''Firvimdol Eastmere''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Lyrabar]] as of {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/The Rage||1}}
==Description==
Firvimdol was fat, with a waxed, curling moustache, and sported genuine velvets and gems. He was young.
==Abilities==
Firvimdol had some magical ability, and was taught some spells by [[Sammaster]].{{cite book/The Rage||2}} Though rudimentary, he could cast spells very alike to [[forcewave]] and [[shocking grasp]].
==History==
On [[Hammer 16]], he relayed to [[Gorstag Helder]] that the Wearer of Purple, [[Cylla Morieth]], commanded him to steal an [[emerald]] from the pawnbroker [[Hezza]]. Gorstag succeeded at this task.

On [[Hammer 21]], Gorstag and Firvimdol accompanied [[Sammaster]] to Queen [[Sambryl]]'s castle, where he snuck in to speak with the turncoat [[bronze dragon]] [[Quelsandas]].

On [[Alturiak 8]], he surprised Gorstag Helder stealing documents from the First Speaker. Confirming his suspicions that Gorstag was a spy, he resolved to slay him; he perished in the ensuing battle, but mortally wounded Gorstag in the process.{{cite book/The Rage||5}}
