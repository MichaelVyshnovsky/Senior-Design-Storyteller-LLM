        "mainbody": "'''Quendar Horn''' was a criminal [[duergar]] [[mage]] in [[Heliogabalus]] as of the late mid-14{{th}} century DR.The story is assumed to occur during the reign of Gareth Dragonsbane, as Pavel Shemov claims the king is \"a paladin of Ilmater\" and this happens prior to 1373. Gareth Dragonsbane rose to power in 1359 DR, with no other kings of Damara known to be such paladins of Ilmater. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the events of Silverfish occur during the 1360s DR.",
        "Description": "He had a pale left eye that winked repeatedly. His battle-axe was graven in runes that pledged him to Abbathor; his garments were festooned in glittering amulets.",
        "Personality": "He was jumpy and surly.",
        "Abilities": "He counted himself both a mage and a skilled cutpurse.",
        "Activities": "He was known to skim more than his fair share of some crimes.",
        "History": "The day that [[Kosef Demsk]] allegedly killed [[Mivar Greyman]], Quendar Horn had been with him all day. The next day, he was briefly questioned by [[Pavel Shemov]], who suspected that Kosef was set up; Quendar almost got violent, but [[Tana Farag]] interceded and removed the priest before his face.",
        "Rumors": "He had a reputation as one of the city's most notorious killers."
