The Omen of Despair was a unique and powerful black unicorn â€“ a creation of Szass Tams necromancy rituals, birthed into its unholy form in the late 15 century DR.
The Omen of Despair was created to look like a pitch-black unicorn, with its eyes and horn glowing in sinister crimson radiance. Its master, Regent of Thay, Szass Tam, used dark necromantic rituals to give this magical beast the ability to sap all hope and joy from the hearts of living creatures around it. It could produce a dark vortex of energy that pulled creatures around it toward the beast and its deadly horn.
Soon after the Omen of Despair was assigned to serve a group of Thayans, the black unicorn brutally ravaged them, eventually funding an adventurer in Neverwinter and offering them its service instead.
