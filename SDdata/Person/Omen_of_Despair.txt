The '''Omen of Despair''' was a unique and powerful [[black unicorn]] – a creation of [[Szass Tam]]'s [[necromancy]] rituals, birthed into its unholy form in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Omen of Despair was created to look like a pitch-black unicorn, with its eyes and horn glowing in sinister crimson radiance. Its master, Regent of [[Thay]], Szass Tam, used dark necromantic rituals to give this magical beast the ability to sap all hope and joy from the hearts of living creatures around it. It could produce a dark vortex of energy that pulled creatures around it toward the beast and its deadly horn.

Soon after the Omen of Despair was assigned to serve a group of Thayans, the black unicorn brutally ravaged them, eventually funding an adventurer in Neverwinter and offering them its service instead.
