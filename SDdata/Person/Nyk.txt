'''Nyk''' was a [[goblin]] who lived in the [[Lower Heart]] ward of [[Skullport]] in [[Undermountain]] around [[1370 DR]], and twin to [[Nok]].

Nyk and Nok were a pair of enterprising [[goblin]]s who swept up the dung left by the [[Raging Bull]], a long-imprisoned [[minotaur]] suspended from the ceiling by [[The Deepfires]] inn. They used the dung as manure to grow mushrooms. They would tell stories about failed rescue attempts for a [[copper piece]].
