        "mainbody": "Harkle Harpell was a wizard who belonged to the Harpell family and lived in the small town of Longsaddle.\nHe was a little shorter than average, with long, brown hair that stuck out from his head at odd angles. He wore a set of worn wizards robes and had an air of enthusiasm about him that somehow managed to be unnerving.\nWhile he was friendly to the Companions of the Hall, Harkle was also quite eccentric, which also caused most that knew him to be reluctant to be around him unless it was necessary.\nOne of Harkles accident-free successful spells was his Fog of Fate, which transported the caster wherever they needed to be to accomplish their goals. Upon casting of the spell, Harkle ended up in the middle of the Sea of Swords, but was saved by Drizzt and the crew of the Sea Sprite. While under the effects of the spell, he magically transported the Sea Sprite and crew to Carradoon. As a drawback of the spell, Harkle had his memory of the previous adventure with Drizzt erased from his mind.\nWhile on this adventure, Harkle worked together with Captain Deudermonts ship wizard Robillard on several occasions. Notably, when the crew encountered a small swarm of zombies, Harkle demonstrated a new variation on Bigbys Crushing Hand where the conjured hand powerfully flicked its targets away.\nWhen the Companions of the Hall entered Longsaddle in 1356 DR, Harkle was one of the first Harpells to greet the heroes. He even journeyed the Sword Coast with Drizzt DoUrden and Catti-brie in 1364 DR."
