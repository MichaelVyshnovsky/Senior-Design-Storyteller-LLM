'''Asheru''' was a powerful [[wizard]] and a senator of [[Innarlith]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR. 

==Description==
In the 1370s DR, he was middle-aged and he had long black hair which may have been dyed to mask the grey. He had gray-green eyes. 

==Personality==
He was laconic.<ref> 

==Relationships==
He was an ally on the senate with Senator [[Meykhati]]. 

==History==
Sometime prior to [[1340 DR]], Asheru was responsible for making magical defenses to protect [[Pristal Towers]] in Innarlith, the private home of the [[fire genasi]] [[Pristoleph]], one of the wealthiest people in the city.

In the 1360s DR, Asheru was both a senator and the head of an underground college of wizards.

Asheru joined in the funeral procession for the assassinated Senator [[Khonsu]] on [[Greengrass]], [[1364 DR]]. He, Meykhati, and other senators retired to the [[Peacock Resplendent]] inn after the funeral to speak with [[Willem Korvan]], who had secretly assassinated Khonsu, in order to offer him a senate seat in exchange for him agreeing to vote for their causes on the senate for five years.

After [[Salatis]] became the new Ransar of Innarlith in [[1365 DR]], with the help of the [[Red Wizards]] he allowed for the establishment of a [[Thayan enclave (Innarlith)|Thayan enclave]] in the city. Asheru, despite not being Thayan, abandoned his former position as head of the college and aligned himself with the enclave, in exchange for a few new [[spell]]s and help with getting on some senate committees that he wanted to be appointed to.

In [[1374 DR]], during the outbreak of violence that took place between the faction led by the senate and the faction led by Ransar [[Pristoleph]], Asheru sided with the senate and helped them in their efforts to unseat Pristoleph. When Pristoleph appeared defeated and the senate faction had seemingly gained control of the city, Asheru publicly suggested [[Marek Rymüt]], the leader of the Thayan enclave, be appointed as the new Ransar of Innarlith. Marek, however, turned down the suggestion and said he would always offer his services to the city of Innarlith.<ref> 

Pristoleph, however, triumphed in the struggle and Asheru was captured by Pristoleph's forces. Pristoleph had Marek, Asheru, and another mage named [[Kurtsson]] gagged and brought to the [[Palace of Many Spires]] to be judged. Pristoleph sentenced the three of them to be handed over to the Thayan authorities to be punished. He was sent into exile.
