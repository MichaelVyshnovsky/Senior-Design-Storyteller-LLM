        "Possessions": "Squeaky was very attached to his oversized [[leather armor]], as it made him feel larger. His favorite weapon was a human-sized [[crossbow]] he called \"Da Crusha\", which he always shot off before going into melee. He kept a ''+2 [[dagger]]'' in a wrist sheath, and wore a magical [[copper piece]] around his neck that hummed when law enforcement came within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of him.",

As a result of his gender and diminutive size, he was relentlessly bullied, pranked, and generally mistreated. He left as soon as he was able and survived the wider Underdark by petty thievery, eventually coming across a vulnerable [[gem]]-laden caravan. As he began stealing his fortune in gems, the glee that filled him burst out in a high-pitched cackle that alerted the caravan guard, leading to his swift capture. The caravan master explained to the young gnome that the pilfered goods belonged to a large \"business consortium\", and Squeaky responded by alternately claiming his innocence and apologizing profusely. In an effort to stop the high-pitched shrieking the caravan master offered him a job, and Squeaky entered the ranks of professional crime as a fence, working for gangsters such as [[Vikhrumn Coll]] and [[Gray'shivnarien Taliain]], and crime lords such as [[Felyndiira Shi'narrvha]]."
