        "mainbody": "Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn, often known as Squeaky, was a deep gnome fence and thief who lived in the Underdark in the 14 century DR.\nSqueaky was small for a gnome at , and had dark gray skin and eyes, messy hair, and a thick coating of grime. He had a very high pitched, grating voice that gave him his name.\nAfter being bullied by everyone who was larger than him, he had an innate lust for revenge against all who slighted him. He tried to use his position to demand respect and authority over other criminals, but they didnt tolerate his impotent grandstanding and threats. When it seemed a fight was about to break out after his aggravations, his threats turned to promises that his mother would arrive and beat up his foes for him. It was generally regarded as quite entertaining to watch Squeaky pick a fight and then be pummeled into submission.\nAs a deep gnome, Squeaky had strong infravision and partial magic resistance, as well as the ability to innately cast blur, blindness, and change self.\nSqueaky was quite good at begging, intimidating, and thought himself good at mimicking other voices (he was not). Those who listened to his voice for too long could be compelled to physically strike him to stop it, while extended exposure to his high-pitched noises could drive others into a state of medium-term insanity.\nSqueaky was very attached to his oversized leather armor, as it made him feel larger. His favorite weapon was a human-sized crossbow he called \"Da Crusha\", which he always shot off before going into melee. He kept a +2 dagger in a wrist sheath, and wore a magical copper piece around his neck that hummed when law enforcement came within  of him.\nthumb|280px|Squeaky attending a meeting at the Think Easy with his fellow gangsters.\nSqueaky grew up in an Underdark svirfneblin village that was highly matriarchal. As a result of his gender and diminutive size, he was relentlessly bullied, pranked, and generally mistreated. He left as soon as he was able and survived the wider Underdark by petty thievery, eventually coming across a vulnerable gem-laden caravan. As he began stealing his fortune in gems, the glee that filled him burst out in a high-pitched cackle that alerted the caravan guard, leading to his swift capture. The caravan master explained to the young gnome that the pilfered goods belonged to a large \"business consortium\", and Squeaky responded by alternately claiming his innocence and apologizing profusely. In an effort to stop the high-pitched shrieking the caravan master offered him a job, and Squeaky entered the ranks of professional crime as a fence, working for gangsters such as Vikhrumn Coll and Grayshivnarien Taliain, and crime lords such as Felyndiira Shinarrvha."
