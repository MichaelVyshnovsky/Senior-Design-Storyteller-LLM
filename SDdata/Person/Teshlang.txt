'''Teshlang''' was an agent of [[Zhentarim]] who operated in [[Daggerford]] in {{Yearlink|1372}}.

==History==
In 1372 DR, during Zhentarim's plot to covertly take over the city of Daggerford via a puppet ruler, Teshlang's cell operated out of the city's sewers. The Black Network cell Teshlang was a part of established a secret route to finance and equip an army of [[orc]]s and even made a deal with a [[devil]], the ancient enemy of Daggerford. The sewer cell was eventually discovered by the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. All members, apart from Teshlang, who was absent at the time, were slain.
