        "mainbody": "ble was a warrior-cleric of Tyr who was a part of the rescue team sent to the Utter East to rescue Piergeiron the Paladinsons bride circa 1371 DR.\nAble was a close friend and an ally of Miltiades, Harloon, Trandon, and Kern Desanea of Phlan, where he was well known for his skill with a warhammer and clerical war magic.\nIn the , on Eleint 17 and 18, Able, along with other paladins of Phlan, was in attendance at the wedding ceremony between the Open Lord of Waterdeep Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter.\nThe wedding was a disaster that resulted in the brides abduction. Able was part of the rescue team assembled by Khelben Arunsun to travel through Undermountain to reach the only portal to the Utter East that was in the vicinity of the city. Blackstaff was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of Kerns anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choiceâ€”traveling through Skullport.\nWhen the paladins reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding zombies by the mysterious Skulls of Skullport in penance for destroying one of the watchers. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Able felt fear of the undead caused by his past failures to turn them with the power of Tyr he sweated profusely, his breath was caught in short heaves and gasps. Even so, he had to perform the task. Able found himself in a city filled with the undead and, upon noticing a zombie that used to be a teenager, the cleric lost the last of his composure. He tried to destroy the walking corpse with his turn undead ability, and it failed. Instead, Able took his warhammer to the undead and disposed of the body. The cleric felt that he aided the zombie by releasing its spirit.\nAfter the paladins passed out of Skullport, they encountered a group of ettins. An unfortunate skirmish let to the death of Harloon, for whom Able delivered a prayer before the rescue team had to move on.\nCloser to the destination, the paladins came across tanarri aiming to use the same portal as the heroes. Barlguras were using a magical mirror located not far from the portal to create duplicates of themselves. Another battle broke out. Able felt the terror of not being able to access his gods divine powers to save his comrades. Thankfully, at the last moment, Tyr granted the cleric the power to stop the advancing tanarri. Able held them off long enough for the rest of the paladins to escape. A barlgura seized the cleric, ripping his head off but granting Able a heroic death in service of the god of justice.\nAble had iron-black hair and deep chocolate eyes. He kept his chiseled jaw clean-shaven even though it remained shadowed even with daily shaves.\nAble was a devoted follower of Tyr, but still had deep-seated insecurities and fears that interfered with his divine abilities. He felt shame and fear of the undead after one of his failed attempts to turn undead almost cost him his life. He was prone to panic facing the undead ever since.\nDuring Abels heroic sacrifice, he was granted divine ability by his god. The symbol of Tyr on his warhammer burned bright, eliminating the entire cavern in holy light. He was able to hold a group of barlguras back, saving his comrades.\nAble, like many other paladins and clerics, carried a holy symbol of his faith.\nHe also wielded a warhammer adorned with Tyrs scales of justice on its head."
