Hakim was an efreetikin who lived in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Perhaps because of his masters numerous negative dealings with genies, Hakim was quite sullen most of the time.
Hakim was the gen familiar of the famed shair Adnan al-Raqi.
Hakim did as his master asked, which usually involved fetching spells from the various elemental planes.
