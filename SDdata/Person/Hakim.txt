'''Hakim''' was an [[efreetikin]] who lived in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|53}}

==Personality==
Perhaps because of his master's numerous negative dealings with [[genies]], Hakim was quite sullen most of the time.

==Relationships==
Hakim was the [[gen]] [[familiar]] of the famed [[sha'ir]] [[Adnan al-Raqi]].

==Activities==
Hakim did as his master asked, which usually involved fetching spells from the various [[elemental planes]].
