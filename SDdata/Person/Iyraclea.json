        "mainbody": "Iyraclea, or simply the Ice Queen, was a female human cleric, divine disciple, and hierophant of Auril the Frostmaiden living within the Great Glacier. Ancient and mighty, she was the self-proclaimed Ice Queen of the glacier.The Ice Queen is said to be a lich in Volos Guide to All Things Magical, but later sources stat her as a living human. This article adopts the later view.\nFormerly of Halruaa, In time, she constructed an ice castle and assembled a monstrous army, including some ice devils.\nEventually, out of Myth Ondath, a city renowned for peace and harmony between races, came explorers who provoked the rage of the Ice Queen. She sent her armies against the pacifist city countless times, but the magical defenses of the mythal always turned aside her spells. Seeking a way to bypass these wards, she learned of a powerful artifact from another plane. Apparently with the assistance of Auril herself, Iyraclea stole the Gatekeepers Crystal from the hands of the Gatekeeper in the Outlands.\nIn Eleint of the Year of Burning Skies, 632 DR, she sent an army commanded by the lich Vrandak the Burnished, her greatest general, to lay siege to Myth Ondath for one final assault. She also raised great winter storms that lashed the city throughout the year, in an attack called the Ice Queens Winter.\nIn the Year of Chasms, 633 DR, after an 11-month-long siege, Iyraclea sent Vrandak to sneak into the city. Using two pieces of the Gatekeepers Crystal, Vrandak nullified the Eldathyn priests power to turn undead as well as all necromantic magic for 50 miles (80 kilometers). Together, Iyraclea and Vrandak used the whole Gatekeepers Crystal to destroy the city of Myth Ondath, including its mythal. However, the power of the artifact was too great and Iyracleas army and her general Vrandak also vanished during the destruction, and the pieces of the Gatekeepers Crystal were scattered and lost.\nIn the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, Sammaster, master of the Cult of the Dragon, who had triggered a premature Rage of Dragons that year, proposed an alliance to Iyraclea, and she agreed. Sammaster sent to her the white dragon dracolich Zethrindor and a host of dragons. Zethrindor helped Iyraclea to conquer all the Great Glacier and afterward they marched over Sossal. The conquest of the druidic nation proceeded well until Brimstone approached Zethrindor, whispering that Iyraclea plotted to betray Sammaster with power hidden in ruins in the Novularond Mountains. Soon, the white dracolich went to the ruins hoping to achieve that power for himself. Iyraclea also discovered that information and marched to the same location. Dorn Graybrooks adventuring party arrived at the ruins, and a terrible three-sided-battle broke out. Zethrindor killed the Ice Witch during the fighting.\nAfter Iyracleas death, Auril elevated her to become one of her exarchs and set her to work foiling the plots of Akadis spies within the Land Under Eternal Ice. Meanwhile, she was survived by an iceborn clone of herself hidden in a great vault beneath the Delhalls in Vaasa, who believed that it was the true Iyraclea.\nIyraclea was almost the personification of the goddess Aurils cold fury.\nIyraclea had long golden-hued hair. Her skin bore gray and white sigils of Aurils holy symbol.\nIyraclea was the ruler of the Great Glacier.\nAround 1372 DR, Iyraclea was known for her habit of using magic to kidnap healthy young wizards from Sossal, Damara, and Vaasa, for an unknown but no doubt evil purpose. Some wondered if she stole their life essences to extend her own unnatural lifespan, while others feared she was building an army of mages, who served her through loyalty or some form of coercion. Others dreaded that she was harnessing their magical power to extend the Great Glacier into the Cold Lands once more.\nIyraclea was very interested in discovering the lost giant civilization of Jhothûn, which was thought to be buried somewhere below the Great Glacier. One of her gelugon servants, Tosvin, had actually discovered a portal leading to one of the cities of Jhothûn, but he kept his discovery from her.\nAs a high-ranking cleric, she wielded great divine magic, commanding the domains of Air, Storm, and Water. She created a few mighty spells of her own cold claws, ice fist, and icerazor.\nShe once used a miracle to make herself utterly immune to the effects of cold.\nAs a divine disciple of Auril, she was resistant to divine magic and the magic of outsider creatures she could communicate telepathically with all outsiders that either served her goddess or were neutral evil, to a distance of 60 feet (18 meters) and could \ngrant the use of her spells to her servants. Furthermore, she had transcended her natural form to become an outsider, a creature of the divine, herself, becoming resistant to fire and electricity, able to ward herself with protection from good, and highly influential with fellow followers of Auril.\nAs a hierophant, her spells were more powerful, her negative energy spells were more potent against neutral good beings, and her arms-reach spells could hit foes up to 30 feet (9 meters) away. Furthermore, she could cast cone of cold and ice storm innately, a few times a day.\nShe was somehow unnaturally long-lived.\nIn addition to her skills as a priestess, spell-wielder, and a ruler, she was also a capable warrior, an expert in wilderness lore and a survival, and a crafter of magical weapons and armors.\nIyraclea bore a staff of frost, though it lacked the wall of frost power. She went into battle wielding a +3 icy burst battleaxe, +5 mighty icy burst composite shortbow with +5 arrows, carrying +5 moderate fortification large steel shield, and wearing +5 fire resistance full plate. She also wore a ring of evasion and a ring of freedom of movement, an amulet of natural armor +3, a cloak of resistance +2, and a periapt of wisdom +6. She also owned and made use of a rod of absorption, a rod of flame extinguishing, and a minor circlet of blasting.\nA holy book of the Church of Auril, Revelations of the Icedawn, was directly bestowed upon Iyraclea by her goddess and was kept in her possession.\nIyraclea dwelt in or beneath a castle of sculpted ice lying somewhere in the northernmost part Great Glacier, but few ever saw it and lived to speak of it.\nThe Ice Queen was served by a number of ice devils, or gelugons, known as the \"Icy Claws of Iyraclea\".\nElminster once knew Iyraclea. He considered her as one candidate for Augury 14 of the Caleph Auguries, telling of a woman with eyes of moonlit snow, whose anger would cause pain to the land, but he doubted she would destroy the Realms."
