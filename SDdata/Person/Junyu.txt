Junyu was one of the greatest swordsmen in Kuda in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Junyu was once one of the most talented duelists in Kozakura, tutoring many students, but sensing a void in his life he decided to become a priest in a Konjo temple. Junyu still accepted a few pupils but now his lessons to them were harder and more philosophical. His current pupil was Miyoshi.
