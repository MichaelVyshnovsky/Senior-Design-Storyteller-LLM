        "mainbody": "'''Ygga Raxyg''' was an [[arcanaloth]] who was imprisoned in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] by [[Acererak]] to guard the [[Demilich|demilich's]] library. To any [[adventurer]]s who came to the library, he presented himself as '''Mr. Fox''' and appeared as an old man using [[illusion]]ary [[magic]] to disguise his true form.",
        "Description": "Ygga Raxyg appeared as an old man, who would pretend to be asleep in his chair when any intruders entered the Red Library in the Tomb of the Nine Gods.",
        "Abilities": "Ygga Raxyg had the spellcasting abilities of a powerful [[arcanaloth]] and used the ''[[alter self]]'' spell to appear as an old man.",
        "Possessions": "Ygga Raxyg wore a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles which also doubled as a gate key to a two-way [[portal]] in the planar city of [[Sigil]] leading to the [[Cosmology|plane]] of [[Arcadia]]. The glasses had no other magical properties but could fetch prices of up to 2,500[[Currency|gold pieces]] if sold to a sage or wizard.\n\nFurthermore, Ygga Raxyg had a gold-inlaid wooden [[music box]], which had five sides sculpted to depict a horned musician playing five different instrument. The music box had a value of 750 gp.\n\nYgga Raxyg was bound to protect the Red Library under the curse of [[Acererak]]. Among the many magical tomes, [[scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s the arcanaloth guarded, ''[[X the Mystic's Arcane Grimoire]]'' was the most valuable.",
        "Trivia": "* Ygga Raxyg's name is an anagram of [[Gary Gygax]], one of the original creators of [[Dungeons & Dragons]]."
