'''Neyanla''' was a [[water naga]] guardian of a mystical stream on the [[Malatran Plateau]] that housed magics of a [[jungle spirit]] who revered all reptiles in ages before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I am Neyanla, guardian of the stream. Those who came before you threatened me with their weapons. They sought to drink from my waters in this mystical place. But they would not pay the price for the sustenance. Do you wish to drink? And are you prepared to meet the price? Know you that the deer would pay a higher price than the fawn. The water will find only one of you worthy.''|Neyanla}}

==Description==
Neyanla was a {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} long beautiful [[naga]] with [[emerald]] and turquoise scales that formed reticulated patterns of brown and pale [[jade]]. Her body had red spikes running along the spine that rose up when Neyanla was angry. She had pale green eyes. Neyanla was a fierce protector of the stream but not aggressive. She was curious and engaged in conversation in her melodic voice with white who bore no ill will.

==Abilities==
Like many other nagas, Neyanla was a capable spellcaster. She usually memorized such [[spells]] as ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[web]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', and ''[[lightning bolt]]''.

==History==
In the Year of Gathering Darkness on the Malatran calendar, Neyanla lived in a mystical stream's waters, serving as its guardian, long after the patron spirit of the steam had left the Living Jungle. The stream possessed magic, and the naga collected payment from those who would drink of it. Her price was an honest conversation. During the [[Festival of the Mask]] in the Year of Gathering Darkness, some [[Festival Walk]]ers who approached the stream threatened its guardian. Neyanla quickly killed these individuals, three [[Nubari]] and two [[shu]] adventurers. Their bodies would soon be discovered by a group of heroes of the Living Jungle who, too, participated in the Festival of the Mask. Neyanla was there every year for the festival to converse with guests as the festival itself began two decades earlier when a man drank from the stream and communed with the naga to learn to be closer to the jungle land. Those Festival Walkers who were pure of heart received a boon from its magical waters: a permanent ability to ''[[speak with plants]]'' or ''[[speak with animals]]'' once per day.
