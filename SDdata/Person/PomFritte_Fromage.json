        "mainbody": "Sir PomFritte Fromage was an eccentric hin adventuring knight of the Golden Rooster from the Living City, Ravens Bluff, active in the late 14 century DR.\nPomFritte was a pompous swashbuckling halfling who spoke with a distinct accent â€“ pronouncing \"the\" as \"zee.\"\nSir PomFritte Fromages \"snugglebunny\" was named Chickadee.\nIn Uktar, Nightal of the , PomFritte Fromage announced the formation of the so-called Halfling Nation. The knights reasoning and plans for the new-fangled nation were laid out in the interview conducted by Jennylou Brightleaf of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet. The interview occurred in Sir Fromages large suite in the Seven Tigers Inn. The knight stated that elves and dwarves formed cities, towns, and nations of their own, unlike the hin (strangely forgetting about the existence of Luiren). However, he did not propose that halflings leave Ravens Bluff and start a farming community elsewhere. The Bluff has all the amenities the eccentric knight wanted, food was acceptable, and the lodgings were tidy. When asked what laws this proposed Halfling Nation would follow, Sir Fromage declared his commitment to the Golden Rooster and the citys laws. The halfling ended the interview as he needed to supervise the construction of his wine tasting room and closed it by declaring that all haltings who were interested in joining the \"nation\" were to stop at the Seven Tigers Inn and book a room using the special Halfling Nation rate."
