After being ordered to bring in [[the Enclave]], a powerful cabal of wizards based in the [[Greenfields (Unther)|Greenfields]], Shuruppak managed to kill several of their members before being driven back.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Shuruppak tried to quell rioting in [[Messemprar]] by taking hostages and staging public executions of them.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Shuruppak's god Gilgeam was slain by [[Tiamat]]. With Gilgeam's death, Shuruppak was stripped of his [[Chosen]] status and lost what remained of his sanity, going rogue.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Shuruppak still wandered throughout [[Unther]] slaying all he perceived as enemies of himself or Unther. Both the [[Church of Tiamat]] and the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were actively trying to recruit him at this time.\n\nThe last sighting of Shuruppak was on [[Midsummer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}.<ref>{{Cite dragon/358/Volo's Guide: War upon the Sands|71}}"
