Iarno Albrek, also known as "Glasstaff", was a human wizard and the leader of the Redbrands bandit gang.
He was a short, dark-bearded human wizard that was simply known to most as "Glasstaff" for his weapon of choice, a magic staff made of glass, which was a staff of defense. Iarno was initially a member of the Lords Alliance, who was sent to the town of Phandalin to establish constabulary (as the town did not have a powerful authority).
Albrek had a rat familiar that served as a scout. His familiar would notify him of intruders via telepathy.
Circa 1491 DR, Iarno broke ties with the Lords Alliance and created the Redbrands under the guidance of Nezznar. Iarno knew of Nezznar from his contacts in the Lords Alliance and negotiated a meeting with the drow, seeing a chance to line his pockets.
