'''Iarno Albrek''', also known as '''"Glasstaff"''', was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and the leader of the [[Redbrands]] bandit gang.

==Description==
He was a short, dark-bearded human wizard that was simply known to most as "Glasstaff" for his weapon of choice, a magic [[staff]] made of glass, which was a ''[[staff of defense]]''. Iarno was initially a member of the [[Lords' Alliance]], who was sent to the town of [[Phandalin]] to establish constabulary (as the town did not have a powerful authority).

Albrek had a [[rat]] [[familiar]] that served as a scout. His familiar would notify him of intruders via [[telepathy]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} Iarno broke ties with the Lords' Alliance and created the Redbrands under the guidance of [[Nezznar]]. Iarno knew of Nezznar from his contacts in the Lords' Alliance and negotiated a meeting with the [[drow]], seeing a chance to line his pockets.
