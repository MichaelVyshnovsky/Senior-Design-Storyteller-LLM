Scratch was a dog and the companion of the courier Gomwick, who lived on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.
He had a metal and leather collar that was inscribed with his name.
Scratch loved to play fetch with his toy ball and, like other dogs, enthusiastically buried any bone he was given.
In the , Gomwick was killed by gnolls in a forest near the Risen Road. Scratch waited patiently at his friends side for some time, believing him to be injured and needing rest.
