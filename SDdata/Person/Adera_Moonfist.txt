'''Adera Moonfist''' was a famed thief in [[Ravens Bluff]].

==History==
She descended from [[Satcheera Moonfist]], a member of the [[Turning Key]], a famed [[Mulmaster]] adventuring party that had hidden a treasure in [[Flooded Forest]].

In [[1491 DR]], she decided to seek out her ancestor's treasure. However, in her search, Adera approached the [[mind flayer]] [[Vanquo]]. Vanquo also desired that treasure and seized the opportunity to capture Adera. It absorbed all information from her and finally replaced her brain with an [[intellect devourer]], killing her. The intellect devourer then adopted [[Adera (intellect devourer)|her identity]].{{Cite adventurers league/Bounty in the Bog|5}}
