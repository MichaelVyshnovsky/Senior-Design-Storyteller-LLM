Adera Moonfist was a famed thief in Ravens Bluff.
She descended from Satcheera Moonfist, a member of the Turning Key, a famed Mulmaster adventuring party that had hidden a treasure in Flooded Forest.
In 1491 DR, she decided to seek out her ancestors treasure. However, in her search, Adera approached the mind flayer Vanquo. Vanquo also desired that treasure and seized the opportunity to capture Adera. It absorbed all information from her and finally replaced her brain with an intellect devourer, killing her. The intellect devourer then adopted her identity.
