Orn was a fire giant who made his home at Mount Hotenow on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.
Orns skin was similar to coal in color. His hair and beard were fiery red. He wore heavy black armor and wielded a giant sword.
Orn did not care about the consequences of his actions when it came to fulfilling his ambitions of creating a mighty dragon-slaying weaponâ€”including the destruction of the lands around Mount Hotenow.
Orn took control of Mount Hotenow to harness the powers of the magma river at the mountains heart. His goal was to create the greatest dragon-slaying weapon the world had ever seen.
In attempting to create a weapon using Mount Hotenows magma river, he caused volcanic activity that threatened surrounding regions. In order to stop him, four adventurers set out and likely defeated him.
