'''Orn''' was a [[fire giant]] who made his home at [[Mount Hotenow]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Orn's skin was similar to [[coal]] in color. His hair and beard were fiery red. He wore heavy black [[armor]] and wielded a giant [[sword]].

==Personality==
Orn did not care about the consequences of his actions when it came to fulfilling his ambitions of creating a mighty [[dragon]]-slaying weaponâ€”including the destruction of the lands around Mount Hotenow.

==Activities==
Orn took control of Mount Hotenow to harness the powers of the magma river at the mountain's heart. His goal was to create the greatest dragon-slaying weapon the world had ever seen.

==History==
In attempting to create a weapon using Mount Hotenow's magma river, he caused volcanic activity that threatened surrounding regions. In order to stop him, four [[adventurer]]s set out and likely defeated him.
