Gasker Haerocloak was a mysterious wizard who lived in Tarmalune in 1479 DR.
Gasker had ill-reputation in Tarmalune. It was believed that he could sicken people he had previously touched with a strange spell.
In 1479 DR, the Vigilant sought Gasker to bring him to justice after one of his former servants accused him of having killed people using his sickening spell, and Gasker was forced to hide, disappearing shortly thereafter.
