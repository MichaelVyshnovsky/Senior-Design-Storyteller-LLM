'''Shatil''' was a young priest of [[Zaltec]] in [[Palul]] and the brother of [[Erixitl]].

==History==
Considering his sister and his father [[Lotil]] weak for their compassion, Shatil decided to join the clergy of Zaltec. In [[1361 DR]], he became the prime assistant of the high priest [[Zitli]].

Zitli conspired with the [[Nexal]]an high priest [[Hoxitl]] in order to arrange an ambush against the [[Golden Legion]] at Palul. Under Shatil's suggestion, Zitli decided to use Erixitl as a translator.

He and Zitli were at Zaltec's pyramid during a false party held there to welcome the legionaries. However, when the legionaries started attacking the hidden Nexalan warriors, it became clear that they had uncovered the plot. Zitli sacrificed himself to allow Shatil to escape via a secret passage in order to explain the situation to Hoxitl.

Arriving in Nexal, Shatil introduced himself to Hoxitl and asked to join the [[Viperhands]] in order to destroy the strangers. Hoxitl was very pleased by the young priest and inducted him into the Viperhands. Later, Hoxitl instructed Shatil that his sister was a danger to Zaltec and needed to be killed and that Shatil was the best choice as assassin. The high priest also gave to him the [[Talon of Zaltec]] to help him in his mission.

When searching for his sister, Shatil met [[Halloran]] and Lord [[Poshtli]], who welcomed him without suspecting his intent. Gradually, however, Shatil had begun to reconsider the will of Zaltec, no longer believing that his god  could want the death of his sister. When he finally met her, Shatil did not act against Erixitl.

With the arrival of the [[couatl]] [[Chitikas]] and the treachery of the [[Ancient Ones]] finally unveiled, Shatil fully joined his sister and her companions. Shatil explained to them where the lair of the Ancient Ones  was located, inside [[Mount Zatal]].

During the fighting in the [[Highcave]], Shatil was killed by some arrows shot by the [[drow]].
