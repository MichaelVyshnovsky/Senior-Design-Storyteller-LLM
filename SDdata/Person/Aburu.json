        "mainbody": "Aburu was a camel living in Marigolds Menagerie in the mid-14 century DR.\nAburu was rather arrogant, had a foul temper, and would spit at whoever passed her by.\nBefore being moved to Marigolds Menagerie, Aburu worked as an animal performer at the Mooney & Sons Circus. Being such a hassle to take care of, Marigold Mufflefoot was in search of a trustworthy individual to take the camel back to the desert land she had originated from."
