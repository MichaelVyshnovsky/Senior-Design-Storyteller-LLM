        "Description": "He was tall and lean.",
        "Personality": "He was cynical and bitter. He enjoyed watching dances, and listening to melancholic tunes.",
        "Abilities": "To become the [[Magister]], Almer had prepared a trap where he rigged a number of wands to shoot on their own.",
        "History": "Almer Galarthund prepared a trap for [[Quaervaxthanus]] in which he rigged a number of wands to discharge all of their power against the [[beholder]] from all directions; he himself was gravely injured in the process, as the wands blew up the mountainside. He found healing, but the memory of that pain made him overly cautious, traveling always in disguise, assiduously employing defensive magic, and striking first at any wizard who got too close. He resolved eventually to train a successor, but was ambushed and slain before he could."
