In 1358 DR, Mrinden was a member of the secret Zhent occupation army in High Dale. Together with Kalassyn and a group of Zhentilar soldiers, he found a gate and a dead guard. They entered the gate but suddenly a meteor—a symptom of the Time of Troubles—hit their squad, killing most of them, including Mrinden."
