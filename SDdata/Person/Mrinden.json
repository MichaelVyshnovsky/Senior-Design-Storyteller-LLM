        "History": "Mrinden fought with his companion [[Kalassyn]] in [[Daggerdale]]. In [[1358 DR]], Mrinden was a member of the secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. Together with [[Kalassyn]] and a group of [[Zhentilar]] soldiers, he found a ''[[gate]]'' and a dead guard. They entered the ''gate'' but suddenly a [[meteor]]—a symptom of the [[Time of Troubles]]—hit their squad, killing most of them, including Mrinden."
