Princess Daemir was an elven adventurer from the City of Song, Myth Drannor, active before the citys fall in the Weeping War.
Daemir had pale skin and black hair.
In her younger days, Princess Daemir adventured with an early iteration of the Company of the Swanmays, an all-female troupe. She looked fondly on that period of her life. She died sometime before the fall of Myth Drannor and was interred at the citys Burial Glade. However, she did not depart the Prime Material plane and kept her watchful eye over the Burial Glade as one of many ghosts that roamed the ruins of Myth Drannor and its mythal. In the , Tyranthraxus, the Possessing Spirit, claimed Myth Drannor and Princess Daemir offered her blessing to a group of heroes who sought to stop the ancient creature. She was surprised that her old adventuring company was still operating many centuries after her death.
