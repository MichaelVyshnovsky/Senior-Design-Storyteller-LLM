        "Abilities": "He could throw [[sword]]s quite accurately.",
        "Description": "During his meeting with [[Galan Goadulphyn]], he was clad in black leathers.",
        "Personality": "Athtar was unmoved by the tempers of Galan Goadulphyn. He seemed unaffected by the idea of a [[human]] armathor, save for the opportunities that he anticipated in the ensuing chaos.",
        "Relationships": "He conspired with Galan Goadulphyn to take advantage of any chaos.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|241}}, after [[Elminster Aumar]] was named [[Armathor]] by [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], he met with Galan Goadulphyn somewhere in a forest. There, he suggested that Galan should take advantage of the chaos just like Athtar himself thought his house should.\n\nAfter [[Delmuth Echorn]] lured the new Armathor away for a spell duel, Galan became concerned that their magic would bury or detonate one of his hidden caches. While heading for it, the duel ended when Delmuth Echorn's ''[[call bones]]'' spell was reflected, sending his skull out as a projectile towards Elminster, who reflected it with his shield. The cranium struck Athtar Nlossae's head, killing him instantly."
