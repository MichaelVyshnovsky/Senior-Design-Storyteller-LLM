        "mainbody": "Athtar Nlossae was an inhabitant of Cormanthor in the 3 century DR.\nHe could throw swords quite accurately.\nDuring his meeting with Galan Goadulphyn, he was clad in black leathers.\nAthtar was unmoved by the tempers of Galan Goadulphyn. He seemed unaffected by the idea of a human armathor, save for the opportunities that he anticipated in the ensuing chaos.\nHe conspired with Galan Goadulphyn to take advantage of any chaos.\nIn , after Elminster Aumar was named Armathor by Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, he met with Galan Goadulphyn somewhere in a forest. There, he suggested that Galan should take advantage of the chaos just like Athtar himself thought his house should.\nAfter Delmuth Echorn lured the new Armathor away for a spell duel, Galan became concerned that their magic would bury or detonate one of his hidden caches. While heading for it, the duel ended when Delmuth Echorns call bones spell was reflected, sending his skull out as a projectile towards Elminster, who reflected it with his shield. The cranium struck Athtar Nlossaes head, killing him instantly."
