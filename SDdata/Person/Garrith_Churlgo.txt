'''Garrith Churlgo''' was the great great grandfather of [[Millie Churlgo]] who started the production of [[Churlgo Cheese]] in the [[Dalelands]] long before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Garrith was the Churlgo family enterprise leader who pivoted the farm from mostly growing grains to crafting Churlgo Cheese. He also was the developer of the original Churlgo Cheese recipe that proved to be a popular treat across the [[Sword Coast]] in the decades that followed.
