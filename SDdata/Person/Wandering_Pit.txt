The '''Wandering Pit of Vaasa''', often referred to simply as '''the Pit''', was a mysterious entity which terrorized [[Vaasa]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Under normal circumstances, the Pit was completely hidden and virtually undetectable as it could perfectly camouflage into almost any terrain, whether grassy, muddy, or rocky. However, when it attacked, it opened suddenly as a {{SIAdj|20|foot|long=yes|adj=wide}} and {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes|adj=deep}} hole filled with spikes.

It was unclear whether the Pit was a creature, some kind of animate [[trap]], or an amalgamation of multiple things.

==Activities==
The Pit roved all across Vaasa, attacking unsuspecting victims everywhere from the [[Sunderland]] and the [[Galena Mountains]] in the east to the [[Bottomless Bogs]] in the west. It would appear without warning beneath the feet of its victims, snap open suddenly and swallow them, and then just as suddenly spring shut with its prey inside. It would then vanish completely.

==History==
The Pit, or something similar to it, was responsible for swallowing a delegation of [[Red Wizards]] who attempted to gain an audience with [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR.

The Wandering Pit gained its name and notoriety when it began attaching folk across Vaasa in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}. Since it appeared shortly after the defeat of Zhengyi and the collapse of his [[Castle Perilous]], many believed that it was some abomination or defense mechanism that had escaped from the castle. It was known to target travelers, even snatching up a rider along with their [[horse]]. In one notable case, a party of [[adventurer]]s searched desperately for the Pit after they saw it snatch one of their members, but even digging {{SI|8|foot|long=yes}} deep revealed no sign of the thing. The Pit further became a menace to the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Hillsafar Hall]], who placed a 500 [[gold piece]] bounty on it.
