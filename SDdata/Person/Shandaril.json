        "mainbody": "'''Shandaril''' was a particularly wicked [[archmage]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] who slew other mages purely to eliminate rivals and acquire their [[spell]]s and [[magic]].",
        "Personality": "She had a cold and selfish manner.",
        "Description": "She was strikingly beautiful and quickly learned how to use her appearance to get what she wanted.",
        "Activities": "[[File:ShandarilSigil.JPG|thumb|left|250px|''Shandaril's sigil.'']]\nShe penned ''[[Shandaril's Workbook]]'', which she used to ensnare other mages with the help of a clever [[spell]] she developed called ''[[Shandaril's tracer]]''. The spell provided her with the knowledge of the precise location of anyone carrying her workbook. She could then either ''[[teleport]]'' directly to the unknowing target to confront them herself, though she rarely did this in order to keep herself hidden without risking a deadly confrontation. Instead, she usually sent minions to do the dirty work for her. She was fond of sending a pair of [[invisible stalker]]s after her prey with explicit instructions to bring the targets back to her after rendering them helpless. If for some reason they were defeated she would send more powerful creatures.",
        "History": "Shandaril was born in [[Telflamm]] and later moved to [[Sembia]] with her merchant parents. She studied magic under two tutors in [[Selgaunt]]: [[Halakoun]] and [[Mairgaer]].\n\nAt a young age, she apprenticed under [[Thalaver]], a mage and [[adventurer]] of [[The Company in Crimson]]. She went with them into the [[Stonelands]] and its ruins, and there murdered every member of the Company and stole their magic. She returned alone to [[Suzail]] to rob [[Thalaver's Tower]], but was met by [[Vangerdahast]] and other notable mages asking where the rest of the Company was. She boasted of her crime and escaped with her life, but only barely, thanks to a [[teleportation]] item.\n\nShandaril remained wanted in [[Cormyr]] for the slaying of the Company in Crimson; the royal warrant was still outstanding as of [[1357 DR]]. Her exact whereabouts were unknown after she fled Cormyr, but she was believed to have moved south. After that, she released ''Shandaril's Workbook''.",
        "Possessions": "Shandaril carried a ''[[staff of power]]'' that she took from Thalaver, as well as his spellbooks."
