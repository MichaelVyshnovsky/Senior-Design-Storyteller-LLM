        "mainbody": "Athelstan Meiados was a Tormtar paladin in the city-state of Saelmur, in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAthelstan served as the leader of Saelmurs local temple of Torm, the Shrine to Duty. And like Saelmurs other religious leaders, he also served as a member of the city-states governing council, the Councilium of Prelates.\nIn 1370 DR, Athelstan was of the same mind as his fellow Prelate Thallon Geiros when it came to the Knights of the Black Gauntlet, an order of Banite crusaders that had conquered the nearby cities of Mintar and Kzelter in 1362 DR and 1370 DR respectively. The two believed that the Knights forces waging war with Saelmur was inevitable, but unlike Thallon and the other Prelates he desired to go to war with the Banites sooner rather than later.\nIn several of the Counciliums meetings, Athelstan would threaten to mobilize his Tormtar forces and strike at the Knights forces in Mintar by himself. His advisors and fellow Prelates always managed to talk him down from such a reckless move, but with each passing day his patience grew ever thinner."
