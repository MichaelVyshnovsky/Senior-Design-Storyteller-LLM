{{quote|''No idea where those [[goblin]]s came from - one moment we're stepping out of the [[Salty Dog Tavern]], and suddenly there's a mess of them running through town. We sounded the alarm, but...''|Honest Jon}}

==Description==
Honest Jon was dressed in the Targos Guard's [[leather armor]], a horned [[helmet]], and was armed with a [[spear]] and [[dagger]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] was besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. One of the Legion's surprise attacks hit the Targos docks, where Jon, [[Brohn]], and [[Reig Redwaters]] stood guard. Jon survived unscathed, but Brohn was killed and Reig was badly wounded. Jon did his best to bandage his partner's wound, but he needed a ''[[healing potion]]'' or risk bleeding to death. Shortly after, the ''[[Wicked Wench]]'' arrived with a group of adventuring mercenaries from [[Luskan]], who proceeded to aid Reig and the town at large.
