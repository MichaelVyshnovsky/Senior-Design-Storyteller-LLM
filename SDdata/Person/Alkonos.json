        "Relationships": "Alkonos had some form of familial relationship to the king of Dorn's Deep, being either a cousin or nephew.",
        "History": "Alkonos was considered by many in his community to be a very talented architect, earning him the moniker of \"the Visionary.\"\n\nAt some point in his life Alkonos petitioned the king of Dorn's Deep for the construction of a temple to his god Brightmantle, offended that one did not yet exist. He was granted permission for this project, but during the construction process he acquired an obsessive desire to build a grand complex for his god as opposed to a small temple. People gradually began to refer to him as \"Alokonos the Mad.\" Many complained to the king about his behavior and grandiose plans, but due to their familial bond he brushed their concerns aside."
