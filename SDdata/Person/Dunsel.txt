'''Dunsel''' was a [[dwarf]] with a dream during the early years of [[Khôltar]], the Iron City. In the [[366 DR|Year of the Molten Anvils, 366 DR]], he finally got the funds from his Shieldlord and friend, [[Amberu Khôltar]], to build a road paved in stone from [[Eartheart]] to Khôltar. It took years, and skeptical residents of the Iron City referred to the project as "Dunsel's Dream", but when it was finally completed, dozens of new heavy wagons (invented in the [[368 DR|Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR]], by [[Ulbrask Hael]]) took advantage of the [[Dunsel Trail]] and brought a surge of prosperity to the town as it became a busy trade center. Dunsel didn't stop there: in the years to follow, he continued on, extending his road hundreds of miles across the [[Shaar]] to meet the [[Golden Road]] at [[Shaarmid]], which benefited in a similar way.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|83}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 63: Khôltar, Part 14, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 1}}
