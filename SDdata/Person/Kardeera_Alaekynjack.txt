Kardeera Alaekynjack was the proprietor of the Walking Out to Meet the Dragon drinking establishment in Mosstone, Tethyr, in the late 14 century DR.
Kardeera was a good-looking mountain of a woman with a jovial personality, beloved by all. Kardeera loomed over the troublemakers when a brawl was imminent, peacefully dissuading them from starting a brawl. She was an immensely powerful woman who could defend her tavern by hurling tables and patrons with ease however, she much preferred to joke and chat. She was a capable swordswoman but used her knuckles in a brawl. She fought dirtily and cunningly, using her tavern and the surrounding environment against troublemakers.
Despite her intimidating exterior, Kardeera Alaekynjack was a hopeless romantic who dreamed about being swept off her feet by a bigger and more muscular knight with a heart of gold and a hidden tender streak. Several adventurers tried their luck at courting Kardeera, but none has been successful as the late 14 century DR.
Kardeera Alaekynjack was the daughter of Flindarl Alaekynjack. She grew up in the Walking Out to Meet the Dragon, she ran among patrons as a child, then she served the tables, and after her fathers death, Kardeera took over the establishment. By the late 14 century DR, Flindarl had been dead for a bit over a decade, leaving behind a legacy of a beloved and welcoming tavern. Several years before his death, Kardeeras mother died of a strange fever that caused the woman to cough up black oily blood.
