'''Kardeera Alaekynjack''' was the proprietor of the [[Walking Out to Meet the Dragon]] drinking establishment in [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kardeera was a good-looking mountain of a woman with a jovial personality, beloved by all. Kardeera loomed over the troublemakers when a brawl was imminent, peacefully dissuading them from starting a brawl. She was an immensely powerful woman who could defend her tavern by hurling tables and patrons with ease; however, she much preferred to joke and chat. She was a capable swordswoman but used her knuckles in a brawl. She fought dirtily and cunningly, using her tavern and the surrounding environment against troublemakers.

==Personality==
Despite her intimidating exterior, Kardeera Alaekynjack was a hopeless romantic who dreamed about being swept off her feet by a bigger and more muscular knight with a heart of gold and a hidden tender streak. Several adventurers tried their luck at courting Kardeera, but none has been successful as the late 14{{th}} century DR.

==History==
Kardeera Alaekynjack was the daughter of [[Flindarl Alaekynjack]]. She grew up in the Walking Out to Meet the Dragon, she ran among patrons as a child, then she served the tables, and after her father's death, Kardeera took over the establishment. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Flindarl had been dead for a bit over a decade, leaving behind a legacy of a beloved and welcoming tavern. Several years before his death, Kardeera's mother died of a strange fever that caused the woman to cough up black oily blood.
