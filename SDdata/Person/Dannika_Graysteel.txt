Dannika Graysteel was a scholar who studied nature and weather in the frozen lands of Icewind Dale during the late 15 century DR.
She owned a lantern of tracking that was attuned to elementals, an item that greatly helped her in her studies.
Dannika believed that she could better understand the intense weather that afflicted the Ten Towns by studying the elemental spirits known as chwingas.
Dannika moved to the Ten Towns not long after it was afflicted by the Everlasting Rime. She looked to hire help in order to catch one of the chwingas, which were proving to be rather elusive.
