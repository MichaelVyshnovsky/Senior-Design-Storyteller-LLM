        "mainbody": "Vandathra Paleme was a cleric from Neverwinter.\nVandathra originated from a Neverwintan family with elven blood. Always a chaotic individual, from a very early age she started wandering Faer√ªn and even the planes with few companions. The last time Vandathra was seen was in Aglarond, saying she was planning to go to Rashemen and Thay in hopes of finding magic that would allow her to travel closer to the plane where the goddess Tymora resided. Her luck was always good, so she probably succeeded."
