        "History": "Vandathra originated from a Neverwintan family with [[elven]] blood. Always a chaotic individual, from a very early age she started wandering [[Faer√ªn]] and even the [[planes]] with few companions. The last time Vandathra was seen was in [[Aglarond]], saying she was planning to go to [[Rashemen]] and [[Thay]] in hopes of finding magic that would allow her to travel closer to the plane where the goddess [[Tymora]] resided. Her luck was always good, so she probably succeeded."
