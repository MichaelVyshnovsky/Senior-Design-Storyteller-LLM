        "mainbody": "Neyanla was a water naga guardian of a mystical stream on the Malatran Plateau that housed magics of a jungle spirit who revered all reptiles in ages before the 14 century DR.\nNeyanla was a  long beautiful naga with emerald and turquoise scales that formed reticulated patterns of brown and pale jade. Her body had red spikes running along the spine that rose up when Neyanla was angry. She had pale green eyes. Neyanla was a fierce protector of the stream but not aggressive. She was curious and engaged in conversation in her melodic voice with white who bore no ill will.\nLike many other nagas, Neyanla was a capable spellcaster. She usually memorized such spells as magic missile, burning hands, web, charm person, and lightning bolt.\nIn the Year of Gathering Darkness on the Malatran calendar, Neyanla lived in a mystical streams waters, serving as its guardian, long after the patron spirit of the steam had left the Living Jungle. The stream possessed magic, and the naga collected payment from those who would drink of it. Her price was an honest conversation. During the Festival of the Mask in the Year of Gathering Darkness, some Festival Walkers who approached the stream threatened its guardian. Neyanla quickly killed these individuals, three Nubari and two shu adventurers. Their bodies would soon be discovered by a group of heroes of the Living Jungle who, too, participated in the Festival of the Mask. Neyanla was there every year for the festival to converse with guests as the festival itself began two decades earlier when a man drank from the stream and communed with the naga to learn to be closer to the jungle land. Those Festival Walkers who were pure of heart received a boon from its magical waters a permanent ability to speak with plants or speak with animals once per day."
