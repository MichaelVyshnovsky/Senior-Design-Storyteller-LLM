Reliath Crescentia was a female wood elf lurk and a young member of the Kaliesherai, an association of psionic elves in Evereska.
In the mid-1370s DR, Reliath robbed the Hall of the Kaliesherai of a number of powerful psionic items. The theft triggered huge debates among the remaining members, which came to focus on the future of the Kaliesherai and led to a schism between older conservative and younger expansionist elements.
