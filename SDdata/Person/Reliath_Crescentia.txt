'''Reliath Crescentia''' was a female [[wood elf]] [[lurk]] and a young member of the [[Kaliesh'erai]], an association of [[psionic]] [[elf|elves]] in [[Evereska]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

In the mid-1370s DR, Reliath robbed the [[Hall of the Kaliesh'erai]] of a number of powerful [[psionic item]]s. The theft triggered huge debates among the remaining members, which came to focus on the future of the Kaliesh'erai and led to a schism between older conservative and younger expansionist elements.
