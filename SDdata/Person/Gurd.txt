Brawler Gurd was a  goblin cultist who lived in the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.
He wore a set of crude leather armor, a simple loincloth, and bracers adored with pointed bones. His face was covered in a leather mask under a cloth good.
Gurd was among the few cultists of the Absolute at the Shattered Sanctum who remained focused on their duties and was not easily distracted.
He carried with him a savage-looking goblin scimitar.
Gurd was among the Absolutes warriors who was ready to assault the Emerald Grove enclave, once True Soul Minthara Baenre gave the order.
