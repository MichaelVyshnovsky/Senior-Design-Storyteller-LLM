'''Cadogan''' was an [[adventurer]] in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Cadogan was once an adventurer and a member of the large adventuring party called [[Her Majesty's Reconnaissance Team]]. They were tasked by a crazy noblewoman with recovering family items from [[Netheril]]. After the noblewoman died, the adventurers kept the profits they acquired.

However, the death of the noblewoman triggered a [[curse]] upon the company and they started dying, one each year. In 1370 DR, only Cadogan and two others remained and he was becoming paranoid.

His home was located on the [[Farmer's Road]] and [[Fields Lane]] near the market.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
