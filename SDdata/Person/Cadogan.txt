Cadogan was an adventurer in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Cadogan was once an adventurer and a member of the large adventuring party called Her Majestys Reconnaissance Team. They were tasked by a crazy noblewoman with recovering family items from Netheril. After the noblewoman died, the adventurers kept the profits they acquired.
However, the death of the noblewoman triggered a curse upon the company and they started dying, one each year. In 1370 DR, only Cadogan and two others remained and he was becoming paranoid.
His home was located on the Farmers Road and Fields Lane near the market.
