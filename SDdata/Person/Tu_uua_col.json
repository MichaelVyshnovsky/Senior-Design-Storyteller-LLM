        "mainbody": "'''Tu'uua'col''' was a [[dukar]] of the [[Order of Kupav]].",
        "History": "Born in [[1313 DR]], Tu'uua'col was trained as a dukar by [[Qos]] and others within [[Qatoris]]. He was sent as secret agent to surrounding [[merfolk]] territories. Around [[1349 DR]] he managed to save the life of [[Vhaemas]] against a pod of [[shark]]s and [[sahuagin]]. Despite objections from king [[Ator IX]] and of the court, Vhaemas and Tu'uua'col became blood brothers and the shalarin acted as an adviser for Vhaemas and [[wizard]] tutor for the many royal princelings.\n\nDuring the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] Tu'uua'col was one of the key players in the forging of the [[Nantarn Alliance]] in [[marpenoth]] in [[1369 DR]]. It was here that he finally revealed his allegiance to the lost dukars.",
        "Personality": "Tu'uua'col was a man of word. Above all, he held the vows he had forged with Vhaemas and with his dukar leader [[Gayar]] with the utmost importance. He wanted merfoks to be able to use wizard magic. Col always kept an eye on [[Arina]], whom he considered to be the [[Chosen Star]] as Qos prophesied and a key component in restoring the lost [[Order of Jhimari]].",
        "Relationship": "Col considered Vhaemas his best friend."
