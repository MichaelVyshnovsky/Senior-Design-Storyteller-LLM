'''Pinochet''' was a powerful [[human]] pirate on the [[Sword Coast]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, he and his fleet, acting on the orders of [[Pasha]] [[Pook]], attacked the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'' belonging to Captain [[Deudermont]] to stop the [[Companions of the Hall]] from arriving in [[Calimport]]. Thanks to [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his friends, Pinochet's pirates were defeated and Pinochet was captured.

Deudermont released Pinochet in exchange for Pinochet promising to never target him again. While Pinochet kept his word, his fellow pirates like [[Carrackus]] were not bound by his oath and later tried to avenge him by attacking the ''Sea Sprite''.<ref>
