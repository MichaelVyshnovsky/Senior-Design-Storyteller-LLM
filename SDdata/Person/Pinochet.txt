Pinochet was a powerful human pirate on the Sword Coast.
In the , he and his fleet, acting on the orders of Pasha Pook, attacked the Sea Sprite belonging to Captain Deudermont to stop the Companions of the Hall from arriving in Calimport. Thanks to Drizzt DoUrden and his friends, Pinochets pirates were defeated and Pinochet was captured.
Deudermont released Pinochet in exchange for Pinochet promising to never target him again. While Pinochet kept his word, his fellow pirates like Carrackus were not bound by his oath and later tried to avenge him by attacking the Sea Sprite.
