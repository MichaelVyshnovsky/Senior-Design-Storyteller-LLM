'''Harkina Hunt''' was a resident of [[Elturel]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She had two twin infant sons, [[Brask Hunt|Brask]] and [[Ezo Hunt|Ezo]].

==History==
Harkina and her boys were present in Elturel when it was dragged down to the [[Nine Hells]] in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}. She managed to survive for some time, 

Unfortunately for the Hunt family, while searching for supplies, they were eventually intercepted by the [[barbazu]]s [[Blass]], [[Nodd]] and [[Thunn]], who would sell them into slavery at the [[Wandering Emporium]], if not rescued by adventurers. Harkina could tell them what she knew about Elturel's perilous state.

==Equipment==
Harkina had a [[longbow]] and forty [[arrow]]s, some [[silver]]ed, which she used to defend her family.
