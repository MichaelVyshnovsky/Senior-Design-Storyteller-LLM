Tekuna Chand was the proprietor of the Golden Palm.
She kept her inn open to all regardless of race and beliefs. She preferred to let the town guard keep the order in her tavern.
Though approaching fifty years of age, Tekuna was agile and alert. She was a retired assassin, who rarely plied her trade anymore.
Tekuna Chand wielded an extremely powerful magical stiletto.
Tekuna Chand personally knew many people in places such as the Oasis of the White Palm, and kept up with the news of the Sheik. She also knew that Zorath Blackblade was an assassin, though she wouldnt easily confide this information, and was friends with Happy Hogan Underwood.
It was rumored that anyone making trouble in her inn would get a visit from her after the authorities were done with them.
