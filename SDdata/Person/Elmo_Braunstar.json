        "mainbody": "'''Elmo Braunstar''' was the quiet and well-regarded expert wainwright in the city of [[Ashabenford]] within [[Mistledale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "He ran his own shop in town, [[Braunstar Wheelwright]], whose reasonably priced services were sought by many in the dale, and whose products were demanded by nobles, foreign merchants, and thieves alike.\n\nOne of the most renowned wainwrights in the [[Dalelands]], Braunstar not only sold and repaired carriages and wagons, but created a few designs that were particularly in-demand. His [[Swanswing (carriage)|Swanswing]] model was popular among the regional nobility and the [[Fleetrun (wagon)|Fleetrun long wagon]] was a favorite among merchants of the [[Dragon Coast]] and had a three-year back order as of [[1367 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Braunstar, the designation he preferred over his first name, was a quiet, thoughtful man who was well known throughout Mistledale for his empathy, foresight, and trustworthiness with confidential information. He was quite skilled in cutting through to the heart of a problem when talking them out with others, and offering clear perspective and sound advice. In these regards he was often sought out for council by other members of the community."
