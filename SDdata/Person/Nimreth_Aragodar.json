        "mainbody": "'''Nimreth Aragodar''' was a researcher [[mage]], member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], and the creator of [[enchanted]] ''[[enduring vestments]]''.",
        "History": "Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Nimreth Aragodar performed magical experiments on living creatures. One such experiment involved a [[mountain lion]] that broke out of control and almost killed the wizard. In order to better protect herself from such accidents, Nimreth weaved physical and [[spell]] protections into [[robe]]s she cared ''enduring vestments''. Ironically enough, her new robes did not protect Nimreth from an angry summoned [[water elemental]] who filled the woman's lungs with water."
