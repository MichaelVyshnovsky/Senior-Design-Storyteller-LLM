        "mainbody": "PauKros was an outcast seer in Braeryn in Menzoberranzan in the 12 century DR.\nPauKros was once a wizard with talent in divination and probably some psionic powers. He hailed from a small House and was a master at Sorcere until PauKros earned the disfavor of Gromph Baenre. Suddenly his House was destroyed and he was cast out of the Academy.\nPauKros started living in Braeryn, where he used his talents to tell the destiny of common people for the right price.\nIn 1296 DR, Matron Malice DoUrden under advice from Zaknafein DoUrden went to PauKros in order to know about her new childbirth. The seer confirmed to the Matron that the father of her newborn was Zak. However, just after speaking to Jarlaxle, PauKros revealed that Malice expected a son.\nPauKros was an acquaintance of Jarlaxle and hoped to one day to join House Oblodra."
