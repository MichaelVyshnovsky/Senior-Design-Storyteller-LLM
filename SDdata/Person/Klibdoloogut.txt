'''Klibdoloogut''' was a [[kuo-toa]] [[Sea mother whip|whip]] cultist living in [[Sloobludop]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Klibdoloogut was a whip who, in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, quickly become one of the first followers of the new god [[Leemooggoogoon]] the Deep Father (in truth, the [[demon lord]] [[Demogorgon]]). He was chosen for the duty of keeping the altar in the new Leemooggoogoon's temple, deciding who could access the prophet [[Bloppblippodd]].

He permitted to [[Ploopploopeen]], former ruler of the village and Bloppblippodd's father, and his minions access in order to offer a party of adventurers who had escaped from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] as sacrifices. However, this was all a plan to infiltrate the temple to cut off the head of the cult. At this point, "Leemooggoogoon", along with dozens of [[ixitxachitl]], rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present, including Bloppblippodd, Klibdoloogut, and their cultists.
