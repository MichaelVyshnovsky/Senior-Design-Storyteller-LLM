Klibdoloogut was a kuo-toa whip cultist living in Sloobludop in the late 15 century DR.
Klibdoloogut was a whip who, in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, quickly become one of the first followers of the new god Leemooggoogoon the Deep Father (in truth, the demon lord Demogorgon). He was chosen for the duty of keeping the altar in the new Leemooggoogoons temple, deciding who could access the prophet Bloppblippodd.
He permitted to Ploopploopeen, former ruler of the village and Bloppblippodds father, and his minions access in order to offer a party of adventurers who had escaped from drow slavers of Velkynvelve as sacrifices. However, this was all a plan to infiltrate the temple to cut off the head of the cult. At this point, "Leemooggoogoon", along with dozens of ixitxachitl, rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present, including Bloppblippodd, Klibdoloogut, and their cultists.
