Brawler '''Birka''' was a [[goblin]] member of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] who dwelled in the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|We're juicing it up. The beast came in here with those robbers. Killed Dink - and Mince, too.|Birka.}}

==Description==
Birka wore a [[leather]] harness and loincloth, fortified with [[chainmail]] and metal plates. She covered her face in a leather mask and cloth hood, and wore a necklace decorated with what appeared to be animal bones.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[druid]] [[Halsin]]—in the form of a [[bear]]—and several adventurers attempted to infiltrate the Shattered Sanctum. They were caught by the Cult of the Absolute; while the adventurers managed to get away, Halsin the bear did not. The goblins imprisoned him in the dungeons deep within the Shattered Sanctum.

Birka took several goblin children into the dungeons to ridicule and torture what they believed was just a bear.
