'''Duke Thalamra Vanthampur''' ({{Pronounce|thah|LAM|rah|_|VAN|tham|per|refs=}}) was the matriarch of the [[Vanthampur]] [[patriar]] family and one of the members of the [[Council of Four]], the body that governed the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. While she was openly ruthless, the fact that she worshiped [[devil]]s of the [[Nine Hells]] was a family secret.

==Personality==
Duke Vanthampur was a cunning woman who possessed a resolute will.

==Description==
Thalamra was barrel-chested and had broad forearms thanks to the years she spent performing manual labor. Through her own efforts, she eventually rose through the city's bureaucracy to become the [[Master of Drains and Underways]].

==Relationships==
Over the course of her life, Thalamra married three different men, each of whom died during their marriage. She had a son with each of her husbands, [[Thurstwell Vanthampur|Thurstwell]], the eldest; [[Amrik Vanthampur|Amrik]]; and [[Mortlock Vanthampur|Mortlock]]. She kept Thurstwell hidden away in seclusion at the family villa, Thalamra merely tolerated the existence of her youngest son Mortlock.

==History==
The cunning duke of Baldur's Gate came from very humble beginnings, having worked in the cellars and [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|sewers of the city]] in her youth.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Duke Vanthampur orchestrated events that sent [[Grand Duke]] [[Ulder Ravengard]] to the city of [[Elturel]], just before its disappearance from the face of [[Faer√ªn]]. Soon after, she paid members of the [[Cult of the Dead Three]] to murder Baldurian citizens, in an attempt to discredit the [[Flaming Fist]]. Her ultimate goal was to supplant Ravengard and become the city's Grand Duke herself.

Sometime after her death, Thalamra Vanthampur was said to had clawed her way out of [[Avernus]]. She emerged in [[Ribcage]] in the [[Outlands]], now a [[death knight]], fueled by desire for vengeance and seeking adventurers to help her oust Duchess [[Zelza Zurkbane]], the ruler of Ribcage.
