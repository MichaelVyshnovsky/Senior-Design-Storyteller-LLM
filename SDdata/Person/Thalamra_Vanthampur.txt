Duke Thalamra Vanthampur () was the matriarch of the Vanthampur patriar family and one of the members of the Council of Four, the body that governed the city of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. While she was openly ruthless, the fact that she worshiped devils of the Nine Hells was a family secret.
Duke Vanthampur was a cunning woman who possessed a resolute will.
Thalamra was barrel-chested and had broad forearms thanks to the years she spent performing manual labor. Through her own efforts, she eventually rose through the citys bureaucracy to become the Master of Drains and Underways.
Over the course of her life, Thalamra married three different men, each of whom died during their marriage. She had a son with each of her husbands, Thurstwell, the eldest Amrik and Mortlock. She kept Thurstwell hidden away in seclusion at the family villa, Thalamra merely tolerated the existence of her youngest son Mortlock.
The cunning duke of Baldurs Gate came from very humble beginnings, having worked in the cellars and sewers of the city in her youth.
In the , Duke Vanthampur orchestrated events that sent Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard to the city of Elturel, just before its disappearance from the face of Faer√ªn. Soon after, she paid members of the Cult of the Dead Three to murder Baldurian citizens, in an attempt to discredit the Flaming Fist. Her ultimate goal was to supplant Ravengard and become the citys Grand Duke herself.
Sometime after her death, Thalamra Vanthampur was said to had clawed her way out of Avernus. She emerged in Ribcage in the Outlands, now a death knight, fueled by desire for vengeance and seeking adventurers to help her oust Duchess Zelza Zurkbane, the ruler of Ribcage.
