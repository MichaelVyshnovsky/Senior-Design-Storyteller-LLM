Suluq was an enslaved efreeti in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Suluq was trapped within a ring of genie summoning and did his masters bidding whenever he was called.
Contrary to most enslaved genies, Suluq actually liked his master, Fasim Kaldur. Suluq and Fasim got along quite well since Fasim treated him fairly and frequently allowed him to exercise his thirst for committing violence.
