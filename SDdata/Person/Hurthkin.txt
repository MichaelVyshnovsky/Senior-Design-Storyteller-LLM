'''Hurthkin''' was a [[halfling]] in [[Faerûn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Supposedly, he was born in a small log hut.

He eloped with the [[human]] daughter of one [[Guirath Moondock]]; she was short enough that she could almost pass for a halfling herself. They married and had a petite half-human half-halfling daughter. She in turn married a human man, and their son was [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], who lived in [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], by [[1366 DR]]. Jasper aspired to be halfling rogue like his "Grandpaw Hurthkin".

==Personality==
According to his grandson Jasper, Hurthkin liked to take advantage of [[human]]s as much as any halfling.
