'''Welso''' was a [[deep gnome]] from [[Clan Ironhand]] that lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I'm coming, Meerna!|Welso, calling out to his sister.}}

==Personality==
According to [[Meerna]], Welso was a temperamental man who needed to learn to keep his anger in check were he ever to become a Burrow Warden. She also believed that he needed more training in reading the stone as Welso was "as blind as a surfacer sometimes."

==Relationships==
He had a sister Meerna, a deep gnome Burrow Warden, whom he cared for very much.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Welso joined [[Wulbren]], [[Beldron]] and other Ironhand gnomes on an expedition into the ruins of [[Grymforge]] to seek out ancestral knowledge of their clan. They sought to recover any remnants or information on [[runepowder]], a fabled substance of gnomish folklore said to have been given to the Realms by [[Gaerdal Ironhand]] himself.

Unfortunately, nearly every member of their group were taken captive by [[duergar]] slavers from [[Clan Flameshade]] and forced to serve as miners for the [[cult of the Absolute]]. Welso's sister Meerna became seperated from the group when the tunnel she was in collapsed. Welso was absolutely despondent when he could not contact her through the rubble and became single-minded in ensuring her rescue.
