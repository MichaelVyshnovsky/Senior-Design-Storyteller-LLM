Phanar Manthar was a devout priest of Oghma and the disowned son of the Waterdhavian noble House of Manthar.
When Phanars master, Loremaster Gustyl "the Curious", died in 1371 DR, Phanar took on his responsibilities. Phanar introduced Raegar Stoneblade and Damlath to one another and insisted they work together. Together their surveillance and dispatching of Surkhas of Leilon was able to prevent the Arcane Brotherhood from claiming the High House of Thalivar and its secrets.
