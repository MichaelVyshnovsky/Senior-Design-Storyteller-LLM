'''Phanar Manthar''' was a devout priest of [[Oghma]] and the disowned son of the Waterdhavian noble House of [[Manthar]].

==Background==
When Phanar's master, Loremaster [[Gustyl]] "the Curious", died in [[1371 DR]], Phanar took on his responsibilities. Phanar introduced [[Raegar Stoneblade]] and [[Damlath]] to one another and insisted they work together. Together their surveillance and dispatching of [[Surkhas]] of [[Leilon]] was able to prevent the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] from claiming the [[High House of Thalivar]] and its secrets.
