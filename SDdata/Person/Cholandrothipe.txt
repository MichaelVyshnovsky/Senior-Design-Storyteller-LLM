'''Cholandrothipe''' was a skilled [[wizard]] who once lived in [[Feather Falls (village)|Feather Falls]] in [[Featherdale]].

==Activities==
Cholandrothipe constructed a [[Cholandrothipe's Tower|tower]] that became Feather Falls' prominent landmark. The tower was a heavily trapped and dangerous place, making some inhabitants of the town wonder about the wizard's kindness.

Cholandrothipe used his magic for a fee to transport cargo safely across the [[Feather Falls (waterfall)|Feather Falls]]. His fee usually fell into the 25â€“50 [[gp]] range, causing many to believe he had quite the stash of coin hidden somewhere within his tower.
