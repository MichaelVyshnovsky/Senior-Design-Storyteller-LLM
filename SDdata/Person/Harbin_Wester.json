        "mainbody": "Harbin Wester was the Townmaster of Phandalin and subsequently a member of the Town Council of Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.\nHarbin was a corpulent middle-aged banker and politician.\nHarbin was pompous and pretentious. He generally presented himself as polite and friendly, but this was just for politics. In fact, he was a greedy, calculating, and two-faced businessman at heart, unafraid to push the boundaries of decency or legality to get what he wanted. He was known to be cunning and dishonest, and he cared little for others unless their fates impacted his businesses. That said, he was also genuinely a fretful and hapless coward when faced with dangers beyond his control. For example, when a dragon was spotted in the area around Phandalin, Harbin locked himself inside his home and insisted on conducting all townmaster business from behind his closed door (including paying out rewards for bounties and jobs, leading to him sliding payments under his door one coin at a time).\nAs townmaster, Harbin served as mediator, judge, and record-keeper for Phandalin. He carried one set of keys to the jail cells in the Townmasters Hall. He was also responsible for posting jobs and bounties, and for paying out the rewards for these tasks. \nIndependent of his role as townmaster (and later town councilor), Harbin acted as a banker in Phandalin, lending out both money and land. He was known to use the debts owed to him to pressure townsfolk and business partners into giving him what he wanted. While he was unsympathetic to the plights of the people, he did try to ensure that the town remained prosperous and didnt get involved in affairs that did not concern it.\nAlthough he was good at pretending otherwise, Harbin cared relatively little for the townsfolk of Phandalin, a position which put him at odds with political rival Sildar Hallwinter. He had a number of connections in both Neverwinter and Waterdeep, which he claimed enabled him to field a small army if needed.\nHarbin attracted the ire of the Harpers when he once sent an insulting letter to one of their agents, the Lord Protector of Triboar, Darathra Shendrel, insisting that she do a better job of keeping the Triboar Trail free of orcs.\nHe supported the logging business of his half-brother, Tibor Wester, by using Phandalins money to pay for the logging camps supplies.\nthumb|300px|Harbin Wester welcomes visitors to Phandalin.\nHarbin Wester arrived in Phandalin as it was being rebuilt, and was soon elected townmaster mostly on the basis of his personal wealth and connections. However, his subsequent failures to address two different crises which both occurred circa 1491 DR led to the position of townmaster being abolished and replaced with a town council.\nThe first of these crises related to the arrival of the Redbrand brigands. Even as they began to terrorize Phandalin, Wester did not seem to want to engage the rough bunch. In fact, he felt threatened by them and claimed that they were \"not all that much trouble, really\". Wester refused to arrest any Redbrands until their leader had been slain, or the group disbanded, as the townmaster feared retaliation. Instead, he focused on reports that orcs had appeared close by to the area, specifically in Wyvern Tor, and put out a notice to cull the group.\nThe second of these crises was the arrival of the white dragon Cryovain, who terrorized the region from his lair in the Sword Mountains. Harbin was so frightened of the dragon that he barely left his manor, only venturing out to post jobs and bounties.\nFollowing his failures as townmaster, the people of Phandalin abolished the position in favor of a three person town council. Harbin managed to secure a position on the council by blaming adventurers for the ills that the town had suffered under his leadership. Then in the , he ran for the newly created position of mayor using the same platform."
