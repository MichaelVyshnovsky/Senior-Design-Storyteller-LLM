        "mainbody": "Thunderstorm was a human warrior who wandered the Realms as a nomad mercenary in the mid–14th century DR.Thunderstorm is called a \"nomad mercenary\", but it is unclear if \"nomad\" simply describes his travels or if it means he hails from a nomad tribe.\nThunderstorm was orphaned when he was a young child and had been on his own since his teenage years.\nBy 1356 DR, he traveled Faerûn, seeking battles to fight in and what rewards he could win. He survived many battles to become a veteran warrior by the 1360s DR.\nIn the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR, riding his horse, Thunderstorm fled the onrushing effects of the Spellplague, alongside several wild animals.\nHis great agility helped him defend himself.\nHe fought with a longsword +3, a shield, and a javelin of lightning, and wore a girdle of stone giant strength. He commonly rode a horse."
