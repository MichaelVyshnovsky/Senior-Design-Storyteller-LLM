She was insistent on traveling to the far-off city of Tashluta and learning more from the oracle of the House of the All-Seeing Orb, Valin Sarnaster.\nOne of Candlekeeps Great Readers, Alai Aivenmore, became concerned at Mayastans sudden shift in focus and set a group of adventurers to follow her to Tashluta.\nUpon her arrival, Mayastan was received by the servants of Valin Sarnaster and taken into her inner sanctum. Mayastans pancreas was forcibly removed and replaced with that of Valin Sarnaster, as part of the ritual that would transform the dragonborn sage into one of the oracles canopic golems. Realizing the fate that awaited her after the transplant, Mayastan chose to end her own life and not allow Sarnaster to gain strength at the expense of her own body."
