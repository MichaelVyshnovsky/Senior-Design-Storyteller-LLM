'''Narulph''' was a [[highknight]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Narulph was strongly biased towards doing nothing.

==Activities==
He was a [[Highknight]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Relationships==
During the mission to [[Shadowdale]], Narulph was under the direct command of [[Eskrel Starbridge]].

==History==
Narulph was tapped by Eskrel Starbridge as part of the task force he decided to personally lead a search for the fugitive [[Elminster Aumar]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, despite his protests.

During the raid in a cave full of [[doppelgangers]], where one of these creatures pretended to be Elminster, Narulph had to be ordered by Eskrel not to pursue the creature once it fled.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|333|32}} Later, Narulph was one of the members of the group when they captured [[Storm Silverhand]], believing her to be another possible Elminster imposter. When she revealed herself to be a noble of Cormyr and the ranking Highknight, he was severely mystified, and she proceeded to outmaneuver his commanding officer so deftly that Starbridge gave away [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]]'s ''[[teleport ring]]'' before any of the knights even understood what was happening. Narulph called him out on this, but Starbridge dismissed such concerns.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|335-339|32}}
