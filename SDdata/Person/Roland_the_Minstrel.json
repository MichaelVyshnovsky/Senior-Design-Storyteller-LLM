First amongst them was that [[Martek]] had originally created the ruins under the Oasis as well as those at [[Phoenix]], long before they were dedicated to [[Set]]; he still chose to hide his Star Gems in them. He also knew that Martek, the greatest mage of his time, had foreseen the future and left a gift to the Sultanate of the tribes, giving them the knowledge of where the Great Good slept, to be loosed when the Great Evil (almost certainly [[Khalitharius]]) came. He also knew that the ancient city of Phoenix was located west by northwest of the Oasis. He knew that Martek had delivered unto the Pharaohs of his day the five gems known as the Star Gems of Mo-Pelar, Shah-Pelar, Khan-Pelar, Aga-Pelar, and Melos-Pelar, items of great mystery, but his greatest creation was actually his own citadel.\n\nFinally, he knew a bit of Martek's Epic.\n{{quote|When the evil walks our land again,\nwill nomadic princes come to set\nhis power into the first bride's hand,\nthat good and evil are then met.\n\nThen will needs be,\nFive Star Gems see,\nTo my tomb be borne hither,\nand hope shall not wither.\nOpen the gates to my sphere of power,\nand put off evil in its appointed hour.|Martek's Epic}}"
