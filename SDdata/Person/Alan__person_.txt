Alan was one of the inhabitants of Daggerford who died and was buried long before 1372 DR.
Presumably Alans last adventure was the cause of his death. He was buried in the Daggerford Graveyard just a couple of hours outside of the city walls, in the Eastern Farmlands. His grave was topped with a monument of a bigger size than the most in the south-eastern corner of the gated land a stones throw away from a stream that eventually joined Delimbiyr River. By 1372 DR, Alans grave marker was still in good condition with the engravings clearly readable.
