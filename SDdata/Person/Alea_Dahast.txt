'''Alea Dahast''' was a female [[elf]] who led a raiding party on a [[human]] camp in [[Cormanthor]] in {{Yearlink|-75}}.
The purpose of the raid was to kill the camp's inhabitants and destroy the settlement, but Alea and her party rescued the [[Netheril|Netherese]] wizard [[Baerauble Etharr]] in the process. The two would later become lovers.

Known as the "High Lady of Art", she helped raise the ''[[mythal]]'' over [[Myth Drannor]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|340-356}}

Alea would later become the Spell-Major of the [[Akh'Faer]] and a High Mage from [[490 DR]].

She fought in the [[Weeping War]] and died on [[Flamerule 11]]â€“[[Flamerule 12|12]] of [[714 DR]] in one of the last battles of the war.
