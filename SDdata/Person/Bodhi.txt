'''Bodhi''' was an exiled [[elf]] from [[Suldanessellar]] who was later transformed into a [[vampire]].<ref group="note"> In the [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (novel)|Shadows of Amn novel]], Bodhi presents herself as a [[human]], hiding her [[vampiric]] nature. She and her "sibling" known as "the Exile" [[Jon Irenicus|Joneleth Irenicus]] orchestrated a grand scheme to steal the divine essence of the dead god [[Bhaal]], and take revenge on their former homeland.

==Personality==
Bodhi was exceptionally cruel, sadistic, and evil, delighting in playing with her "prey" before their destruction. She believed that being undead gave her a supernatural focus and stimulated her curiosity. Bodhi developed an intense interest in those abilities held by inherently powerful beings.

Like Irenicus, she held a deep hatred for the elven community she was born into and later exiled from. She thought them to be the epitome of arrogance and pride. Unlike him she did not suffer a dispassionate existence, rather she gained pleasure in the pain of others.

==Abilities==
As a vampire, Bodhi possessed great strength and ferocity, even more so than others her kind. With the soul of a [[Bhaalspawn]] infused into her, she grew even stronger. Her physical abilities were truly formidable, and she was fearsome in close combat. She was capable of ''[[energy drain|draining the lifeforce]]'' of any being she struck with her claws.

Similarly, she suffered the same disadvantages such as an intense aversion to sunlight. Interestingly enough, she even suffered from some form of sea sickness.

==Possessions==
Over time Bodhi had collected a number of [[tome]]s that detailed vampirism, including: ''[[Dea Vampir Becomos]]'', ''[[Conjur Ota Serevanta]]'', and the unabridged version of ''[[The Vampiricus Omnibus: Unabridged|The Vampiricus Omnibus]]''.

==Activities==
Bodhi led a vampiric thieves guild that operated in an underground lair located beneath the [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]] of [[Athkatla]]. Her group of thieves competed against the famous [[Shadow Thieves]] guilds who operated all across the nation of Amn. During the conflict, she abducted scores of subjects that were held for use in Irenicus' experiments.

==Relationships==
She had an extremely unhealthy relationship with her "sibling" Irenicus. The two lived their exiled lives devoted to revenge against their former community.

Within her thieves' guild, she had a number of vampire followers. Most notable among them were her right hand [[Cohn Ta'glaen]], [[Antenos]], [[Valen]], and [[Meredath]]. They in turn were served by a number of thralls, who were given belittling names such as [[Chore]] and [[Fetch]].

==History==
===Early Life===
Bodhi was born in the elven city of Suldanessellar. She was a popular individual who was closely tied the city's greatest [[mage]], Joneleth Irenicus. Over time she drew Joneleth into her ever-increasing quest for power without consequence. She and Irenicus embarked on campaign to achieve godhood by draining the [[Tree of Life]] of its magical essence. The pair were stopped by the elves of the forest and suffered the same punishment. The pair of exiles were cursed, stripped of their connection to the [[Seldarine]] and exiled from their home.

Bodhi sought to counteract her cursed state by seeking out [[undeath]]. Unfortunately, being turned as a vampire failed to grant her a "life" longer than that of a mere [[human]].

At some point during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Irenicus came up with a plan to steal the divinity of another being to continue with his plan, and take revenge on [[Queen Ellesime]]. Bodhi remained with her "brother" and aided him every step of the way. He sought out a number of targets, including the Shining Lady [[Caelar Argent]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. However he settled on the Bhaalspawn [[Abdel Adrian]], and his half-sister [[Imoen]]. The pair were able to abduct the pair and their companions just outside of [[Baldur's Gate]], and imprisoned them beneath [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in Athkatla.

When Irenicus' dungeon was assaulted by the Shadow Thieves, Abdel and Imoen gained an opportunity to escape from their cells. Upon reaching the city proper, both Irenicus and Imoen were apprehended by the [[Cowled Wizards]], and taken to the asylum of [[Spellhold]].

===Mistress of Thieves===
Bodhi used her thieves' guild to attract Abdel Adrian and involve him in her war against the Shadow Thieves. While she acted under the pretense of seeking Irenicus' death, in truth she was manipulating the Bhaalspawn into sailing to isle of [[Brynnlaw]], where Spellhold was located.<ref group="note">In the novels, Bodhi offers Abdel passage to [[Spellhold]] if he assassinates the meager criminal [[Aran Linvail]] on her behalf. The two become lovers. Bodhi learns of his supernatural heritage after tasting his blood.

When Bodhi arrived in Spellhold, Irenicus was able to remove the divine soul of Imoen and bestow Bhaal's essence upon Bodhi. After Abdel entered into the asylum a short time later, Irenicus incapacitated him, carried out his dark rituals once again, and took the same divinity for himself.

Abdel and Imoen were reunited in the labyrinthine dungeon beneath Spellhold, both having been stripped of their souls. Bodhi set them loose in the domain of [[Dace Sontan]] for her own amusement, planning to eventually feed on the pair. Unfortunately for Bodhi, when she came upon Abdel in the dungeon, he transformed into the [[Slayer]]. This absolutely frightened the vampire, causing her to flee to Irenicus' laboratory.

===Final Days===
{{Quote|You dare speak that name to me? My mistress was turned to ask fighting those forsaken wretches. I curse Bhaal, I curse Irenicus, and I curse you!|''One of Bodhi's Athakatlan vampire devotees.}}
After Abdel and Imoen led a revolt of the inmates at the asylum, Bodhi and Irenicus fled to the drow city of [[Ust Natha]] in the the [[Underdark]]. There they formed an agreement with [[Matron Mother]] [[Ardulace Despana]], helping orchestrate a drow invasion upon the surface elves in the [[Forest of Tethir]].<ref group="note">In the novelization, Bodhi is slain in Ust Natha when Abdel transforms into the [[Slayer]]

Bodhi returned to her lair beneath the the Grave District, in possession of the ''[[Rhynn Lanthorn]]''. Shortly thereafter, Abdel, Imoen, and their companions stormed her thieves' guild and destroyed many of her undead kin. In a final confrontation, the group slew Bodhi and drove a [[stake]] into her weakened body resting within a [[coffin]]. Bodhi was permanently destroyed and Bhaal's divine essence was returned to Imoen.
