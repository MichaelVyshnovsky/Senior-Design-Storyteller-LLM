Simyaz was the leader of the githyanki party sent out after the blade of the sacred Silver Sword of Gith stolen by Irenicus.
The silver blade was passed onto the sailor Saemon Havarian, who knew it could only bring trouble and was anxious to be rid of it. Simyazs group went after him in a levitating ship, but it was somehow capsized, possibly by the same sahuagin who may have attacked Havarians ship. Simyaz and a few other githyanki ended up taken prisoners by the illithids living near Ust Natha, forced to fight for their amusement.
It was rumored that Gorions Ward encountered Simyaz and his group at sea upon Saemon Havarians ship, the Galante. They wished to come aboard his ship and sail out after Irenicus. The githyanki may have attacked the ship, and were interrupted by sahuagin sinking it.
The other time Simyaz may have been encountered by the party of Gorions Ward was in the illithid caverns near Ust Natha. Both parties found themselves captured and were put into adjacent prison cells. Simyaz offered to cooperate with Gorions Ward to escape from the illithids. The wards party was set to fight the in the illithids pit. The githyanki teleported out and left the party to fight the mind flayers.
It was further rumored that Gorions Ward had obtained the Silver Sword, and Simyazs group faced them for the final time in the main cavern outside the illithid compound. There, Gorions Ward was given an option to simply relinquish the blade, but the githyanki may have still decided to attack.
