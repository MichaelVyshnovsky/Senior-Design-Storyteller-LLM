Larch deJun () was a young stable hand in Mulmaster.
Larch was a boy with a good heart and happy with his life. He dreaded becoming a paladin of Tyr.
Larch was a stablehand under Elize, a paladin of Tyr. He was the brother of Nelvon deJun, a Brotherhood of the Cloak member.
In 1491 DR, at a great party in the Astrid Saj villa, Larch was kidnapped by the Kron family, who wanted revenge against his brother. However, Nelvon hired an adventuring party who happened to be present and they eventually saved Larch.
