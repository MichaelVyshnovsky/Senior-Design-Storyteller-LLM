{{quote|''Be alert, laddies! We've got company. Ho, prisoners! Ye've come to th' wrong place, I tell ye true! Ilyich and 'is boys 'll stop you!''|Ilyich}}

==Possessions==
Ilyich wore an [[enchanted]] ''[[mail of the dead]]'' and was armed with a [[battle axe]] and a simple [[sling]]. A medium [[shield]] served as the duergar's main protector.

==History==
Ilych was the chief of the duergar slaves in the dungeon deep underneath the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. He and his men served Jon Irenicus and worked in the dungeon's smithy, forging [[knives]] and tools for torture. The duergar held the acorns of the [[Fairy Queen]] of the [[Windspear Hills]], the only chance for freedom a group of [[dryad]]s enslaved by the evil had. [[Ulene]], [[Elyme]], and [[Cania (dryad)|Cania]] could escape by passing through a newly grown [[oak]] tree if the acorns of the dryads' tree were returned to the Fairy Queen. When [[Abdel Adrian]] approached the smithy, Ilyich and his fellow duergar attacked. The scuttle resulted in Ilyich's demise.
