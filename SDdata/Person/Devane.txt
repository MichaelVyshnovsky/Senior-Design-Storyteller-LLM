'''Devane''' was the [[Helm]]ite Bishop of [[Maztica]] in [[1362 DR]].

==History==
He was a protégée of the late Bishop [[Domincus]] of [[Amn]] and communicated with the bishop through magical means until Domincus was sacrificed to [[Zaltec]] by the [[Viperhands]].

Because of his relationship with Domincus, the [[Council of Six]] selected Devane as the chief priest on the second Maztican expedition. Devane was given a [[flying carpet]] to ride and he used this [[magic]]al device to impress the natives. Devane was initially loyal to [[Don Vaez]], the expedition's leader, but switched allegiance to [[Cordell]] shortly before the second battle of [[Ulatos]].

In [[1362 DR]], the Helmite missionary [[Mirandos]] went missing with a small group of Payit warriors and Bishop Devane commissioned a group of adventurers to track her down and bring her back if possible.

In [[1370 DR]], Devane grew dissatisfied with the small number of new Helmite converts and petitioned Governor Cordell to send expeditions to new unexplored lands inland in order to "reveal Helm's truth to the savages".
