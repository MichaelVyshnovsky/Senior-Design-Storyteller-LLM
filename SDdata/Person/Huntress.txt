The Huntress was a demonic humanoid archer who was linked to the fortress of Watchers Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
She possessed the inherent resistances and immunities that were typically found among fiends, including a form of natural regeneration.
The Huntress and her companions served as one of the three groups connected to the fifth level of Watchers Keep, which held the final seal that kept hidden the Imprisoned One. The group was summoned to the keep when the heart key was used to unlock the seal.
She wielded the unique +4 longbow known as Taralash.
Her allies included the demons Nalmissra, Xei Win Toh, and Ytossi, along with the drow Ameralis Zauviir, and an unnamed hive mother.
The Huntress was killed in the , when Abdel Adrian and his companions delved into Watchers Keep at the behest of the Knights of the Vigil.
