'''The Huntress''' was a [[demon]]ic [[humanoid]] [[archer]] who was linked to the fortress of [[Watcher's Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
She possessed the inherent resistances and immunities that were typically found among [[fiend]]s, including a form of natural [[regeneration]].

==Activities==
The Huntress and her companions served as one of the three groups connected to the fifth level of Watcher's Keep, which held the final seal that kept hidden the [[Imprisoned One]]. The group was summoned to the keep when the ''heart key'' was used to unlock the seal.

==Possessions==
She wielded the unique ''+4 [[longbow]]'' known as ''[[Taralash]]''.

==Relationships==
Her allies included the demons [[Nalmissra]], [[Xei Win Toh]], and [[Y'tossi]], along with the [[drow]] [[Ameralis Zauviir]], and an unnamed [[hive mother]].

==History==
The Huntress was killed in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, when [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions delved into Watcher's Keep at the behest of the [[Knights of the Vigil]].
