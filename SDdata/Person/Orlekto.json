        "mainbody": "'''Orlekto ''' was a [[storm giant]] residing in the [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] in the [[Trackless Sea]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Orlekto was of the mindset that [[giant]]s were chosen by the gods as the rightful rulers of the world and that their race's loss of power over the centuries was simply due to inadequate leaders.\n\nOrlekto was madly in love with [[Hekaton]]'s eldest daughter [[Mirran]]. This infatuation was so strong that he pledged sole loyalty to her, willing to both betray his king and tarnish his honor in her name.",
        "History": "Orlekto was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator [[Uthor]] in the [[Hekaton|Storm King]]'s assault on [[Iymrith]]'s lair. He fought alongside [[Nimir]], [[Shaldoor]], and [[Vaasha]].",
