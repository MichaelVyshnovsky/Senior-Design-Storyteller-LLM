'''Malustra Thaurant''' was a [[Highknight]] of [[Cormyr]], active ''circa'' [[1348 DR]].

==Description==
Malustra was a beautiful and tall woman with impeccable fingernails.

==Relationships==
[[Arglas Duskeldarr]] was attracted to his Highknight Thaurant and often had to drown his feelings in the King's [[bottle]]s and [[decanter]]s.

==History==
Malustra Thaurant operated under the direct orders of [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], the Royal Court Wizard of Cormyr. Malustra was elevated to her position by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] personally. She often worked closely with Arglas Duskeldarr, performing subterfuge assassinations on behest of Vangerdahast, targeting adventurers who often turned treasonous conspirators. First came the poison at a Cormyrean nobles' social function, then the bodies of said adventurers were dismembered.
