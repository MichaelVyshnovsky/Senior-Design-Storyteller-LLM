        "mainbody": "khafta was a drow soldier hunting Drizzt DoUrden in Mithral Hall for Vierna DoUrden.\nIn 1357 DR, Artemis Entreri disguised himself as Regis and infiltrated Mithral Hall for Jarlaxle and his Bregan Daerthe. The mercenary was working for Vierna DoUrden, who wanted to sacrifice her brother to Lloth.\nThe dark elf used his levitation powers to descend a chute used by Drizzt to escape from his villainous sister. Thinking he had sneaked upon the ranger lying on the ground, Akhafta used his club to strike at the prone drow, but the soldier only hit an empty cloak. Drizzt, breaking his vow of not kill another of his kind a second time, slammed his scimitar, Twinkle, into Akhaftas exposed back. Later, Drizzt used a similar trick with Akhaftas body to confuse Artemis into thinking the drows body was that of Drizzt, but it failed.\nAfter his death, Drizzt shot Artemis Entreri with Akhaftas hand crossbow while clinging to a cliff in Mithral Hall, after Artemis revealed he had a cloak of the bat which saved him from falling to his death. The powerful drow poison caused Entreri to fly into a mountain face after he lost control of his magical cloak."
