Drizzt, breaking his vow of not kill another of his kind a second time, slammed his [[scimitar]], [[Twinkle]], into Ak'hafta's exposed back. Later, Drizzt used a similar trick with Ak'hafta's body to confuse Artemis into thinking the drow's body was that of Drizzt, but it failed.\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| source = [[R.A.
