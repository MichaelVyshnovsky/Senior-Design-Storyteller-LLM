'''Rafim Cinder''' was a [[mage]] member of the [[Wizards Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, or within less than a month,{{LCRB}} Rafim Cinder, [[Arroc]], and [[Glithander Ej-lahona]] became the three most recent additions to the famed Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff. Their acceptance into the guild was personally sponsored by the Old Sage, [[Elminster Aumar]] himself, who, at the time, visited the guild to address the looming planet threat to [[The Vast]]. All three new members were rumored to have [[elf|elvish]] blood and to be originally from Elminster's home â€“ the [[Dalelands]]. Rafim Cinder's acceptance into the guild and Elminster's visit were reported in ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' by [[Nadd Parker]], a freelance reporter.
