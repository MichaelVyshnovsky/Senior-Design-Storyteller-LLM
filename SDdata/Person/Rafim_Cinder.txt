Rafim Cinder was a mage member of the Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff, active in the late 14 century DR.
In Eleint of the , or within less than a month, Rafim Cinder, Arroc, and Glithander Ej-lahona became the three most recent additions to the famed Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff. Their acceptance into the guild was personally sponsored by the Old Sage, Elminster Aumar himself, who, at the time, visited the guild to address the looming planet threat to The Vast. All three new members were rumored to have elvish blood and to be originally from Elminsters home – the Dalelands. Rafim Cinders acceptance into the guild and Elminsters visit were reported in Ravens Bluff Trumpeter by Nadd Parker, a freelance reporter.
