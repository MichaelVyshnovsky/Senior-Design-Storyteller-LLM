'''Wistkins''' was a resident of the village [[Volkumburgh]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{ShatteredStatue-Time}}

==Possessions==
Wistkins possessed a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', some [[potion of healing|''potions of healing'']], and a ''[[potion of flying]]''.

==Activities==
Wistkins worked as a miner in the village and spent much of his time searching for the fabled "[[Lord Volkumburgh|Volki's]] treasure."

==History==
In [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} in the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]] some time prior to the [[Feast of the Moon]], a group of [[adventurer]]s came into the village, having been hired by the [[wizard]] [[Amelior Amanitas]] to search for fragments of the [[Awtawmatawn]]. While there they investigated the hut of Wistkins, finding it to be cold and abandoned. All they could find within it was a crude [[map]] of the [[Thunder Peaks]] he had drawn. This map had the village of Volkumburgh marked, as well as the ruins of the [[College of Rune Magics]] and the [[College of Shaping Magics]].

A few years after this he was recruited by a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell in [[Sembia]] to spy on a cell operating in the Thunder Peaks.
