Ghustil Stornugoss was a githyanki healer of Crèche Yllek, on the planet of Toril during the 15 century DR.

Stornugoss, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Yllek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. The gith sought for the astral prism, the artifact that imprisoned Orpheus, the long-lost son of Gith. During that time, Ghustil Stornugoss occupied the Crèches doctors office, from whence she performed her experimentation and research into the new illithid threat of the Absolute.
She also ran the device called Zaithisk, which was said to be able to cure gith of an illithid tadpole infection. Stornugoss was well aware of the fact that Zaithisk did not heal but extracted the minds of the infected gith, ending their lives. When a gith became infected, she encouraged them to use the device. If, by some very unlikely circumstance, an infected individual survived the procedure, Stornugoss made an excuse, leaving them in the doctors chambers, locking the door, meanwhile preparing a cadre of gith warriors to slay the survivors.
