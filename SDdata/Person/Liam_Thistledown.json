        "mainbody": "iam Thistledown was a human child, and the first human encountered by Drizzt DoUrden.\nLiam was the youngest child of the Thistledown family, and was somewhat mischievous. He had light brown hair and eyes, with several freckles.\nIn the midâ€”14 century DR, Liam ventured out of the farming household, slacking from his chores. Drizzts panther, Guenhwyvar, started for the child, but the dark elf stopped her. Later, Drizzt approached the child, and explained his name, whilst pointing to himself. The child screamed in fear, \"Help, its a drizzit!\", and ran back home to tell his family. Some of his folk, curious, ventured out with him. They too eventually met, and were scared off, by the drow renegade.\nUnfortunately, the Thistledown household was raided by the barghest Ulgulu, who murdered every family member, including young Liam."
