        "mainbody": "'''Seven Toes''' was the name used by a [[Harper]] agent who operated on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|[[Lord Neverember]]'s had trouble with our organization before. Here's hoping this can be the start of a new relationship between the Harpers and Neverwinter.|Seven Toes}}",
        "Description": "By his own admission, he was not a particularly tough man.",
        "Relationships": "The old Harper worked with his partner, a [[tiefling]] [[wizard]] by the name of [[Xalliana]]. He had a number of contacts in the area in which they worked, including [[Old Lenn]], the lighthouse keeper that lived in the area around [[Raven Cliff Beach]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Seven Toes was supposed to rendezvous with Xalliana at the [[Broken Crown]] inn on the [[High Road]], but she never showed up and he feared she'd killed by the [[Blackdagger Bandits]]. After meeting up with a famed [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer]] from [[Neverwinter]], who'd been sent by Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] to help the Harpers against the Blackdaggers, Seven Toes asked them to look for Xalliana. Seven Toes gave the adventurer Xalliana's description to check the bodies of the Blackdaggers' victims along the [[High Road]] and to talk with Old Lenn if there was a recent shipwreck. With Old Lenn's aid, the adventurer found Xalliana and the Harpers could investigate further the activities of the Blackdagger Bandits."
