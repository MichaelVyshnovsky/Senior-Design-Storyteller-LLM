'''Diccon Picard''' was a jeweler of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
He ran a jewellery shop on Wattle Lane in Ghars. It was secured with a heavy wooden door with steel bands.

When not working or with a customer, Diccon liked to play his [[fiddle]], knowing such songs as "[[Warrior's Woe]]" and "[[Red-haired Lad]]". However, he was no great talent at it.

==Personality==

A natural salesman, Diccon flattered all his potential customers, even those who couldn't afford to buy.

==Description==
His hair was snow white, big and bushy.

==History==
On [[Kythorn 27]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Diccon Picard and the merchant [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]] rode out of town one evening to see what the new [[Swamp Rat]] (Diccon misremembered it as Swamp Fox) tavern was like. They weren't impressed. On the way back, they sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]] and raced back to town in fear. Since Barthelm didn't want to lose business with [[Shortshanks]] of the rival [[Bold Bard]] tavern, Diccon let on that he had been alone.

Later that year, on [[Eleint 18]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to Diccon's jewellery store to ask him about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be [[Dovo]] in disguise.
