Diccon Picard was a jeweler of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He ran a jewellery shop on Wattle Lane in Ghars. It was secured with a heavy wooden door with steel bands.
When not working or with a customer, Diccon liked to play his fiddle, knowing such songs as "Warriors Woe" and "Red-haired Lad". However, he was no great talent at it.
A natural salesman, Diccon flattered all his potential customers, even those who couldnt afford to buy.
His hair was snow white, big and bushy.
On Kythorn 27 in the , Diccon Picard and the merchant Barthelm Meadowbrock rode out of town one evening to see what the new Swamp Rat (Diccon misremembered it as Swamp Fox) tavern was like. They werent impressed. On the way back, they sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred and raced back to town in fear. Since Barthelm didnt want to lose business with Shortshanks of the rival Bold Bard tavern, Diccon let on that he had been alone.
Later that year, on Eleint 18, Jasper went to Diccons jewellery store to ask him about the ghost sighting, after it was discovered to be Dovo in disguise.
