        "mainbody": "'''Bug Bludgeon''' was a [[gloom staler]] [[ranger]] member of [[The Guild]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Bug was a [[gold dwarf]] man with a pale skin tone, curly light brown hair, and hairless face. He wore a [[splint mail]] with its metal dyed in [[emerald]]-green â€“ the Guild's telltale colors. He was armed with a [[bow]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Bug Bludgeon worked under [[Farlin]], who led a gang of Guild members, dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of Stone Lord's men led by [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]]. However, the meeting devolved into a battle. Bug Bludgeon's and his squad's fate remained uncertain: were they killed by the gangsters or survived and returned safely to the Guild's safehouse."
