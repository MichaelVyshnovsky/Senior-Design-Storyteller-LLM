Fist '''Griff''' was a member of the [[Flaming Fist]], and secretly a [[True Soul]] of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], who served the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Griff was a fair-skinned, blonde, and brown-eyed [[human]] woman. She wore a [[leather armor]] uniform of the Flaming Fist, armed with a [[heavy crossbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Fist Griff could be found in or near [[Bloomridge Park]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. If she were to meet the group of adventurers known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]], following an attempted massacre of the cultist followers of [[Bhaal]], Griff's [[illithid]] tadpole would become a way for the [[Absolute]] itself to communicate with its enemies, leading to Fist Griff's death.
