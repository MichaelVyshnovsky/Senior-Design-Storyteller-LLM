However, he was captured by bugbears.\nKhelgar Ironfist and the Kalach-Cha could have encountered Khayar while he was imprisoned by the bugbears. Once the bugbears were defeated, Khayar would be freed and the Kalach-Cha could have gained influence with Khelgar, so long as there was no mention of Khelgar deserting the clan."
