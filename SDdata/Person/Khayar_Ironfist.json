        "History": "Khayar was an older dwarf, who went to explore the Ironfist stronghold. However, he was captured by [[bugbear]]s.\n\n[[Khelgar Ironfist]] and the [[Kalach-Cha]] could have encountered Khayar while he was imprisoned by the bugbears. Once the bugbears were defeated, Khayar would be freed and the Kalach-Cha could have gained influence with Khelgar, so long as there was no mention of Khelgar deserting the clan."
