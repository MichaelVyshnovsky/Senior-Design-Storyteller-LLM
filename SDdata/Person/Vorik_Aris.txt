Lord Vorik Aris was a noble of Cormyr and a covert supporter of Gondegals revolt and brief civil war in 1352 DR. In 1369 DR, he took over Wyvernwatch Castle and used it as a base of operations as he planned his illicit activities in Cormyr.
Lord Aris was a handsome and distinguished man. His symbol was a skull on a black field with three yellow lightning bolts radiating from it.
He was incredibly ambitious, with arrogance and pride to match. He was dangerously clever and farsighted, enough to achieve his goals, and he unscrupulously allied with anyone who would serve his aims.
Lord Aris expertly wielded a +3 vorpal longsword and a +2 shield, and wore +2 plate armor and a ring of human influence. He rode a prized heavy warhorse, a white stallion named Perdition.
In 1369 DR, Lord Aris built up a loyal cohort of soldiers, mercenaries and adventurers, hiding his forces in Wyvernwatch Castle as he planned raids in the Stonelands and planted spies in Tilverton, Halfhap, Hillmarch, Arabel, Bospir, Thunderstone, Hultail, and Immersea. He ultimately planned on overthrowing Cormyr and becoming King himself.
Lord Aris recruited a large number of followers for his build-up in Wyvernwatch Castle. They included a veteran core of soldiers who had served under Gondegal, human and demihuman mercenaries, undead, adventurers and other opportunistic individuals.
* Tobias Querl, Captain of the guard.
* Four veteran human lieutenants and 100 human soldiers, including 32 veterans of Gondegals war.
* Tanatha, Stormlord of Talos and his spiritual advisor.
* Ratakos, a necromancer who helped handle the undead.
* 75 skeletons and 75 zombies.
* Gribbergrash, orog chief of the Eye Killers orogs.
* Three orog leaders and 60 well-equipped orog soldiers.
* Oznod Brekker, Winaneh Marlowson, and four more veteran scouts.
* Various other groups and individuals.
Lord Aris also managed to somewhat domesticate a nearby mated pair wyverns and their two grown offspring, gaining him fierce protectors for Wyvernwatch Castle.
Lord Aris covertly supported Gondegals overly-ambitious war on Cormyr in 1352 DR, and managed to escape discovery by the Crown. Over the following years he developed his own plans for conquering Cormyr. After assembling his forces in Wyvernwatch in 1369 DR, he marched on the ruins of Darkenshield in order to set up a forwards base for attacking Cormyrean forces in the Stonelands. He was confronted by a group of interfering adventurers that were joined by the bard Mendryll Belarod and the angsty noble Rhyn Mournsoul. The handful of heroes performed a ritual with the Four from Cormyr that drew forth the spirits of the Starburst Swords Purple Dragons, and another which summoned the spirits of the slaughtered residents of Darkenshield.
The vengeful dead swarmed across his forces, and Lord Aris was forced to defend himself alongside his officers, Tanatha, Gribbergrash, and Ratakos. He was ultimately defeated and either killed or driven back to Aris Castle, his plans in ruin.
One of Lord Aris lieutenants suspected that he intended to perform a magical ritual in the ruins of Darkenshield that would aid his military operations.
