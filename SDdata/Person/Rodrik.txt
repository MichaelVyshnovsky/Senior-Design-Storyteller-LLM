'''Rodrik''' was a [[human]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|57}}

==Relationships==
Rodrik was a rival of his nearly identical twin brother, [[Gustaf]]. Rodrik was considered to be the "good" brother.

==Activities==
As of [[1479 DR]], Rodrik was a regular of the [[Beached Leviathan]]. His main goal was to thwart his brother's plans, as he wanted Gustaf to abandon his evil ways. Rodrik usually disguised himself as his brother to achieve his goal. He never raised his sword against his brother, however.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Rodrik may have aided a group of [[adventurer]]s to reach [[Gauntlgrym]], in one of his plans to stop his brother's evil schemes.{{cite dungeon/193/The Gauntlgrym Gambit}}
