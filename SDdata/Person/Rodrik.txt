Rodrik was a human who lived in Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Rodrik was a rival of his nearly identical twin brother, Gustaf. Rodrik was considered to be the "good" brother.
As of 1479 DR, Rodrik was a regular of the Beached Leviathan. His main goal was to thwart his brothers plans, as he wanted Gustaf to abandon his evil ways. Rodrik usually disguised himself as his brother to achieve his goal. He never raised his sword against his brother, however.
In 1479 DR, Rodrik may have aided a group of adventurers to reach Gauntlgrym, in one of his plans to stop his brothers evil schemes.
