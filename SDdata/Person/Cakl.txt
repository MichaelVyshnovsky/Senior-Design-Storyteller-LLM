'''Cakl''' was a [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payit]] in [[Maztica]] in [[1362 DR]].

==History==
In 1362 DR, he was one of the Payit recruited by the rogue priestess of [[Helm]] [[Mirandos]]. However, after he arrived in [[Ixtzul]], the [[bacar]], with Mirandos at their side, arrived and slaughtered all of Cakl's fellows.

Cakl managed to escape and went back to his home.

During the journey, he met an adventuring party hired by Bishop [[Devane]] to find the missing Mirandos.
