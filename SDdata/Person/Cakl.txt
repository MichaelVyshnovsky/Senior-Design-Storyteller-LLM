Cakl was a Payit in Maztica in 1362 DR.
In 1362 DR, he was one of the Payit recruited by the rogue priestess of Helm Mirandos. However, after he arrived in Ixtzul, the bacar, with Mirandos at their side, arrived and slaughtered all of Cakls fellows.
Cakl managed to escape and went back to his home.
During the journey, he met an adventuring party hired by Bishop Devane to find the missing Mirandos.
