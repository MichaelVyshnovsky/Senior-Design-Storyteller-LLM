He organized several clans, numbering around 200 individuals each, to raid caravans passing through the south and south-central regions of the desert. Many of these caravans departed Tajar which was under the rule of Koris son, Ali al-Hadd.\nHe organized a series of fortresses scattered throughout the Range of the Marching CamelsThe source does not specifically mention the Range of the Marching Camels, but it is assumed these are the mountains where the fortresses were located as there are no other mountain ranges found in the southern regions of the High Desert. to serve as treasure vaults. These fortresses were rumored to be hidden with magic.\nThe sheikh allied himself with various clans over the years to suit his needs."
