King '''Caladorn the Wise''' was a ruler of the realm of [[Ulgarth]] in [[southeast Faerûn]] before the 14th century [[DR]].

King Caladorn decreed that priests could not judge a person's worldly behavior. As a result, priests could not serve as either king's justices or baron's justices in the kingdom.

==Legacy==
The [[lieko]], the [[gold]] coin currency of the realm used circa [[1367 DR]], bore an image of King Caladorn the Wise on the front, with a mounted knight on the back.
