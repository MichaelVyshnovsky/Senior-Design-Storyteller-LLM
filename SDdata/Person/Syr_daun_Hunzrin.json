        "Personality": "Syr'daun knew that many despised him for his origins, supposedly coming from a house of farmers. He wanted to bring honor to his house through his martial skill.

He often asked his cousin [[Keptus Hunzrin]], the house weapon master, to support his idea to openly attack a stronger rival house.",
        "Abilities": "Syr'daun was renowned for his skill with the [[glaive]].",
        "History": "Syr'daun was a cousin of his matron mother and a revered master of the Academy, although he did not receive all the respect that he deserved because of his house's supposedly humble origins."
