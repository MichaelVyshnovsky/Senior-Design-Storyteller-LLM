Skella Ironeye was a dwarf (half-duergar, half shield dwarf) prospector member of Clan Ironeye in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Skella led the duergar offensive inside the Lost Level. 
In 1492 DR, during their march Skella stole the dagger of blindsight from Azrok.
She was directing the conquest of the local temple of Dumathoin, which was protected by a clay golem.
Skella was more lawful than the average duergar but would turn against those she suspected of treachery. She was obsessed by artistry and beauty.
