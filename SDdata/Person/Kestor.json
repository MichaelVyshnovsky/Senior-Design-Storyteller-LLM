He was both a member of the citys Merchants League as well as an agent of the Knights of the Shield.\nThe half-elven trader owned a merchant fleet that brought in silks and spices from many exotic countries, like Halruaa, Balduran in Chult, Dambrath, Nimbral, and Tashalar. He was one of the few non-Calishite proponents of the idea that the Knights needed to work with the Rundeen.\nKestor had a very long history of rivalry with Aldeth Sashenstar and used all of his and the Knights resources to try to ruin his rival.\nDuring the iron crisis of 1368 DR, Kestor and his fellow Knight of the Shield agent Tuth took a meeting with Rieltar Anchev and Brunos Costak of the Iron Throne, within the fortress-library of Candlekeep.\nHaving invested a great deal of money in the colony of Fort Flame, Kestor it all when the sahuagin destroyed it the settlement in 1369 DR."
