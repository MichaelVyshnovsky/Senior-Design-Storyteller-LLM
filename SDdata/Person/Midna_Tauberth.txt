'''Midna Tauberth''' was a priestess of [[Shar]] and an adventurer in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].
==History==
Midna was once an adventuring priestess of Shar and a member of the [[Fine Fellows of Daggerford|Fine Fellows]], an adventuring company from [[Daggerford]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Midna and her fellows descended into Undermountain. There, in the [[Dungeon Level]] after [[Kelim]] became lost, [[Halleth Garke]] accused Midna and her two remaining companions of withholding treasures from him, so Midna and the other two beat Halleth to death and threw his body into a pit. However, Halleth rose as a [[revenant]] in order to have vengeance. Unfortunately, he was unable to get out of the pit without help. If Halleth managed to have his vengeance, he finally died for good.

Meanwhile, Midna decided to settle for a time inside the [[Arcane Chambers]] in a ruined laboratory where she managed to control the nine [[unseen servant]]s living there.

==Personality==
Midna searched a diplomatic solution only if she feared for her life.

==Relationship==
The unseen servants obeyed Midna because they mistook her for their creator, a failed apprentice of [[Halaster]].
