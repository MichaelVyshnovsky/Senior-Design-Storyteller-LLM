        "mainbody": "'''Ambuchar Devayam''' was once known as '''Tan Chin''', a powerful [[necromancer]] and the emperor of what would become the nation of [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Biography": "Tan Chin is first noted in history as a young man who discovered several [[artefact]]s from the fallen empire of [[Anok-Imaskar]]. In {{Yearlink|-1377}}, Tan Chin used these artefacts to murder [[Kwan Ying]], the empress of the empire that would eventually become [[Shou Lung]], declaring himself emperor in her stead and renaming the city of '''Ten Mor Shou''' to [[Kuo Meilan]] after his lover. Tan Chin ruled for seven years over a prosperous nation until word reached his ears of his officials in Fenghsintsu province being extorted and murdered by cultists of some dark entity known as [[Black Leopard|Hei Te Pao]]. After seven parties of heroes failed to defeat the cult, Tan Chin resolved to defeat the aggressors himself. After researching Hei Te Pao in the Imperial Library, he discovered that the spirit, a black leopard, could be held under thrall by an enspelled ivory chain. Tan Chin correctly surmised that a powerful [[wu jen]] must be in possession of this chain. He and his friend [[Kar Wuan]] traveled south to defeat this enemy, locating the lair of the cult and eventually meeting their foe. Using the magical spear ''[[Shan Tien]]'', Tan Chin broke the links of the ivory chain, freeing Hei Te Pao, who turned on the wu jen, effectively ending the power of the cult. Tan Chin and Kar Wuan were lauded as heroes, though they almost certainly only defeated the cult to protect the incomes of Fenghsintsus rice paddies.\n\nTwelve years later, the [[tuigan]] were annually raiding the provinces of Chukei and Ma'yuan. The barbarians could not be effectively put down without too high a price so again, Tan Chin and Kar Wuan decided to try and resolve the problem themseves. Kar Wuan had the idea to steal an artefact called the ''[[Jade Mirror of Shih]]'', which could turn even the mightiest of creatures to stone, from its guardian, the great [[lung wang]] '''Pao Hu''', who lived under the waves of the [[Celestial Sea]]. Kar Wuan did so, escaping with his life, while Tan Chin waited for the dragon to notice the theft. When it did, it found only Tan Chin and demanded to know if he knew where the thief was. Tan Chin directed him to the [[Plain of Horses]] where Kar Wuan was waiting on a mountaintop. Using the ''Jade Mirror'', Kar Wuan turned Pao Hu to stone, creating the [[Dragonwall]].\n\nThough he was known as \"hero-emperor\" for these exploits, Tan Chin's creation of an undead army and cruel rule spurred a revolution 76 years later. Led by one of the [[Celestial Empire|Nine Immortals]], the historian [[Chih Shih]] (who was disguised as a wu-jen called Shih-Hai Kwai), the revolutionaries destroyed Tai Chin's undead army with the ''[[Stone Scepter of Shih]]''. Tan Chin fled from the city of Kuo Meilan and into the [[Raurin|Raurin Desert]] where he searched for more Imaskari magic to increase his powers.\n\nAt some point during his search, he discovered a method to turn himself into a strange kind of disembodied [[lich]] with the ability to possess other creatures. Over two-and-a-half millennia later, he traveled north to the city of [[Solon]] where he used his powers and a [[Durpari]] army to conquer the ailing city and subjugate its remaining citizens. With an eye toward ruling over Shou Lung, he began calling himself Ambuchar Devayam, the Raja of Solon, and began excavating the city for yet more [[imaskar|imaskari]] magic. Any mortal subject who died was quickly turned into an undead creature thanks to the [[Stamp of Tan Chin]] and soon there were few living creatures left within Solon's walls due to their being overworked and underfed. He also managed to awaken the purple dragon [[Gaumahavi]], capturing her child [[Sandiraksiva]] in order to ensure her obedience.\n\nAmbuchar attempted to conquer [[Ra-Khati]] at the beginning of the 14th century to use as a staging point to attack Shou Lung.{{cite book/Storm Riders|11}} During this [[War of the Purple Dragon]], the city of [[Kushk]] was destroyed by Gaumahavi at Ambuchar's orders, and the invasion was only foiled when Gaumahavi was defeated in single combat by the [[Dalai Lama]] of Ra-Khati in the sky over [[Saikhoi]].\n\nDefeated but undeterred, Ambuchar continued searching for imaskari items, incidentally cutting off [[Ulgarth]]'s lines of communication with the lands north of it. He was also responsible for the creation of the monstrous [[Dowagu]].\n\nIn {{yearlink|1360}}, Ambuchar attempted another invasion of Ra-Khati, this time marching his now-vast undead army into the hidden realm, probably conquering it. Within a year, he had also conquered [[Khazari]] and a large portion of western Shou Lung, nations that were still weak from the [[Tuigan Horde]]'s invasion. His efforts may have been hindered by an army from the Tuigan Horde led by Hubadai{{cite book/Blood Charge|46}} and by the eruption of the volcano near Solon later that year.\n\nAmbuchar Devayam spent most of his time in Solon in the [[Solon#Star House|Star Houses]] or the [[Solon#Ebony Temple|Ebony Temple]], wherein his crystal [[phylactery]] resided. The Ebony Temple had ''[[portal]]s'' to the para and quasi-elemental [[plane]]s of ice, ash and vacuum.\nIt is assumed that the unnamed plane upon which his essence resided could be reached from there. Per the Paddrasathva of Knowledge, [[Furo]],{{cite book/Blood Charge|40}} if one could acquire four ebony imaskari artefacts from these other planes and toss them into the [[Solon#Ebony Temple|Bottomless Pit of Fire]] in the Ebony Temple, then the lich would be destroyed forever.{{cite book/Blood Charge|63}}<ref group=note>There is no stated source for the players to acquire this information in ''Blood Charge''. However, Furo is stated to know all of the information on the interior gatefold of the book, including Tan Chin's stats, where this information is related. No other source in the trilogy offers any way of learning of Tan Chin's only weakness.\n\nHowever, doing so only prevented the regeneration of his phylactery upon its own destruction, the lich's unique power. Shortly after his invasion of Ra-Khati, adventurers likely acting on behalf of [[Hubadai Khahan|Hubadai]] successfully cast these artifacts into the Pit. Besides forevermore preventing the regeneration of his philactery, this caused the pit to erupt, burying Solon under ash and magma.{{cite book/Blood Charge|60}} The lich likely survived the volcanic eruption; official sources state that years later, adventurers armed with the ''Stone Sceptre of Shih'' used it to destroy him beneath [[Skarou]] in {{yearlink|1362}}.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|146}}",
        "Appearance": "Ambuchar Devayam was six feet tall and weightless in his incorporeal state. Visibly, he consisted only of a pair of glowing golden eyes, a trait gained by any host body that he possessed.",
        "Combat": "Ambuchar Devayam fed upon the life force of the living, and as such preferred to use his [[energy drain]] attack when possible. He often possessed other beings, and retained the use of his supernatural and spell-like abilities while in these hosts.",
