'''Orlex''' was a [[baatezu]] [[devil]] lord who ruled the ancient kingdom of [[Yhalvia]], which was part of the empire of [[Narfell]] ({{Yearlink|-946}} to {{Yearlink|-150}}). His reign was naturally cruel, depraved, and wicked.

A band of rebellious [[wizard]]s arose to depose Orlex. Led by the [[archmage]] [[Thakorsil]], they created the throne known as ''[[Thakorsil's Seat]]'' to imprison and permanently bind and enslave the evil fiend. Unfortunately, although they had the best of intentions, the device demanded deeds of despicable evil to function. Thus, they devised the ''[[ritual of twin burnings]]'', which involved the sacrifice of beings of good heart, believing this was for the greater good, that the ends justified the means.

They went ahead with the horrific rites, and successfully bound and enslaved Orlex in the ''Seat'', forming a council of wizards that governed Yhalvia. However, corrupted by the sacrifices and with Orlex as their slave, they soon became as cruel, depraved, and wicked as the devil they had replaced. In time, others overthrew them, Orlex was banished to the [[planes]] and ''Thakorsil's Seat'' was lost and believed destroyed.
