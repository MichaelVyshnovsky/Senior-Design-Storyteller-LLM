Dror Ragzlin was a hobgoblin True Soul of the Cult of the Absolute.
The hobgoblin had a tattooed face and upper body, brown eyes, and long dark hair, some of which was tied in a bun. Ragzlin wore a sash that was secured with rope around his pink-red muscular body, and was fastened by a metal insignia.
The cultist appeared to lead the other goblinoids that worshiped the Absolute, and so Dror Ragzlin was known as the Warlord of the Absolute. The skilled ritualist was able to speak with the dead.
He held himself in high regard, and strived to serve as the Absolutes right hand, ahead of his fellow True Souls.
Dror commanded a contingent of the goblinoid cultists, alongside his fellow True Souls High Priestess Gut, and Minthara Baenre.
He wielded the unique warhammer called Faithbreaker, which allowed him to strike with the power of the Absolute.
In the , Dror Ragzlin and his minions managed to recover the body of an illithid that had died following the crash of its nautiloid, near the banks of the River Chionthar. The hobgoblin warlord attempted to speak with the deceased mindflayer, in order to find out who was responsible for its death.
