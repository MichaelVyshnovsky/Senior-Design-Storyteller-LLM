{{Quote
|So raiseth your goblets, and drain them with pride!
Dror Ragzlin, the True Soul, hath led you galide!
|[[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s poetic song about Ragzlin
}}

==Description==
The hobgoblin had a tattooed face and upper body, brown eyes, and long dark hair, some of which was tied in a bun. Ragzlin wore a [[sash]] that was secured with rope around his pink-red muscular body, and was fastened by a metal insignia.

The cultist appeared to lead the other [[goblinoids]] that worshiped the Absolute, and so Dror Ragzlin was known as the ''Warlord of the Absolute''. The skilled ritualist was able to ''[[speak with the dead]]''.

==Personality==
He held himself in high regard, and strived to serve as the Absolute's right hand, ahead of his fellow True Souls.

==Relationships==
Dror commanded a contingent of the goblinoid cultists, alongside his fellow True Souls [[Gut|High Priestess Gut]], and [[Minthara Baenre]].

==Possessions==
He wielded the unique [[warhammer]] called ''[[Faithbreaker]]'', which allowed him to strike with the power of [[the Absolute]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Dror Ragzlin and his minions managed to recover the body of an [[illithid]] that had died following the crash of its [[nautiloid]], near the banks of the [[River Chionthar]]. The hobgoblin warlord attempted to ''[[Speak with dead|speak with]]'' the deceased mindflayer, in order to find out who was responsible for its death.
