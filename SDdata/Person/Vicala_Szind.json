She was accompanied by a number of drow, including the Blademaster [[Speitar Dun'Robar]], and her pet [[giant spider]] [[Akorstra]]. Their surprise attack captured the [[Midler farmhouse]] and the entire [[Midler]] family, who were held hostage in their own home and interrogated for any clues regarding the Thread of the Weave, kept paralysed by her [[wizard]]s. Her forces missed the cook [[Maisby]], who hid in the farm shed for a day and night before escaping to Eveningstar to get help. With limited forces to spare, [[Vicben Arroway]] and another [[Purple Dragon knight]] arrived, only to be captured and tortured themselves.\n\nA second group consisting of [[adventurer]]s arrived next, who found Vicben alive and struck at Vicala Szind, only to see her drain the life force from him to restore her own vitality. With his dying breath Vicben warned that she could magically sacrifice all ten of the Midler captives or even her own followers to protect herself, forcing the adventurers to avoid battle with Vicala while stealthily freeing the prisoners and eliminating her forces. Despite her efforts, Vicala was unable to withstand the final assault and fell, finally leaving the Midlers in peace."
