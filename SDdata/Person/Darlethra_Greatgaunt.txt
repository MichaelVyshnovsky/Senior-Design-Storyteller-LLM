Lady '''Darlethra Greatgaunt''' was an eccentric old noble lady in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She liked to walk, and considered [[Suzail]] to be just about level with [[Westgate]] in its danger.

==Activities==
She liked to walk, and hunt. She was also a collector of curios. While in Suzail, she stayed in a rented suite.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|287|30}}

==Relationships==
She liked to walk, and always demanded the company of a [[War Wizard]] when walking through Suzail. The War Wizards, on their part, had little appetite for accompanying her.

==Possessions==
Darlethra Greatgaunt owned forty-six almost identical [[sapphire]]-trimmed dresses.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|282|30}}

==History==
In the aftermath of the [[Council of the Dragon]] of late [[Mirtul]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Lady Darlethra Greatgaunt was abed from a failed poisoning by an unknown party; her guest [[Mirt]], in turn, was impersonating [[Rhauligus Helderstone]]. The Marchioness [[Immerdusk]] and [[Harper]] [[Storm Silverhand]] was herself impersonating Lady Greatgaunt while she slept, and during this impersonation, she was accompanied in extended walks through the streets of Suzail by the fugitive mage [[Elminster Aumar]], who impersonated instead the War Wizard [[Reldyk Applecrown]].

She was later carried out from her with no mess or noise, by someone whom Storm Silverhand was certain to be a noble's agent acting in revenge against an enemy of Rauligus Helderstone, as Mirt had already come across one enemy of Rauligus before and gotten into deep trouble. The same person slew Lady Greatgaunt's cook, leaving only her head for them to find.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|299|32}}
