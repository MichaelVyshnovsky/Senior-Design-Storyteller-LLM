}}'''Coryn''' was a merchant in [[Yûlash]] around [[1367 DR]] who owned the only standing shop in the town.

==Activities==
Coryn ran [[Coryn's All-Goods]] which was a general store where customers could find most of the items they required. Coryn went out of his way to acquire anything his customers desired, making his shop "the" place to frequent for goods.

Unbeknownst to most, Coryn also ran a fledgling rogues' guild that had more dreams than power as of 1367 DR.
