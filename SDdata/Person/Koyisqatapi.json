However, he was attacked by a farastu and escaped, believing himself to have lost the protection of Masauwu.\nHe tried many times to walk the Sun Trail again but always encountered the farastu. At last, in 1362 DR, thanks to the actions of Yenisha, Koyisqatapi asked for the help of Sozarros expedition.\nWith the adventurers help, he managed to defeat the demodand and finally met his god in the Beastlands. However, Masauwu was greatly enraged by Koyisqatapis laziness, complacency, and dependence on gods, and ordered him to learn from the adventurers how to be audacious."
