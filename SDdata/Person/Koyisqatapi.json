        "History": "In [[1359 DR]], Koyisqatabi was elected as the new [[Gilded Priest]] and like all his predecessors he went to [[Dunobo Springs]] and ventured onto the [[Sun Trail]] in order to meet [[Masauwu]] and have his blessing. However, he was attacked by a [[farastu]] and escaped, believing himself to have lost the protection of Masauwu.\n\nHe tried many times to walk the Sun Trail again but always encountered the farastu. At last, in [[1362 DR]], thanks to the actions of [[Yenisha]], Koyisqatapi asked for the help of [[Sozarro]]'s expedition.\n\nWith the adventurers' help, he managed to defeat the [[demodand]] and finally met his god in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]. However, Masauwu was greatly enraged by Koyisqatapi's laziness, complacency, and dependence on gods, and ordered him to learn from the adventurers how to be audacious."
