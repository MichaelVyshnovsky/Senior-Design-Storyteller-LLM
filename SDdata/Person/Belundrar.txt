Belundrar "the Bear" was a Baron of Galadorna during the midâ€“8 century DR.
He was the most loyal baron of King Baerimgrim, and the most law-abiding of them.
He had hairy hands, a beard, and was huge. His eyes were green, with bushy brows, and his nose was jutting, but battered.
He was older than the other barons, and belonged to the oldest and largest noble house in Galadorna. The king viewed him as the best of a bad lot.
During the meeting about King Baerimgrims succession, there were many daggers at his belt.
Baron Belundrar provided additional armsmen for King Baerimgrim during the ailing mans moot to determine succession in the . Though he had issues with Baron Hothals dealings with Laothkund, he was willing to support that, if it meant a solid bid for the throne. He was then blindsided by Baron Maethor backing Baron Tholones bid for the throne, and the rest of the barons coalescing around that one.
A spell then killed Tholone and the king after Nadrathen tried to make his own bid for the throne, Belundrar attacked him, and was killed by the mage just as quickly.
