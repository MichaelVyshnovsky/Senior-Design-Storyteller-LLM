'''Nagamat''' was a [[dragon]] general of [[Tiamat]] during the [[Time of Dragons]].

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-30000}}, Nagamat was in charge of the siege of the [[aearee]] kingdom of [[Shara]], destroying its hatcheries and claiming the realm as his own.

He was soon drawn into religious conflicts between the factions of the draconic gods, and in {{Yearlink|-29500}}, he was killed at the hands of followers of [[Xymor]]. His death sparked the [[Dragonfall War]], a conflict between the followers of [[Bahamut]] and Tiamat, which persisted for thousands of years.
