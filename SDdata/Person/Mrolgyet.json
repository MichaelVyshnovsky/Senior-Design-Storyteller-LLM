        "mainbody": "'''Mrolgyet''' was a [[hobgoblin]] warrior and warlord who commanded his eponymous [[Mrolgyet's Legion]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Mrolgyet dealt with all challenges personally, and it was said that the most dangerous place in his Legion was wherever he was. He was sufficiently intimidating to terrify [[giant]]s into serving his whims, and he was shrewd enough to anticipate the blind spots and weaknesses of his minions and to correct for them.",
        "Relationships": "He had a personal \"champion\" that was really a [[helmed horror]] outfitted in ''[[Frostsilver armor]]''. He also had access to [[magic]] to animate a new helmed horror should his champion ever be defeated.\n\nHe may have had a relationship with [[Kurgaloth]], a [[pit fiend]] who leveraged an [[infernal contract]] with the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]] of [[Waterdeep]] to distract the city from Mrolgyet's machinations in order to increase the likelihood of the city's destruction.",
        "History": "Mrolgyet was a soldier who rose through the ranks through personal combat. As commander of his own Legion, he worked to grow his forces and acquire powerful equipment. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, he brought under his command chieftains and leaders of [[gnoll]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[ettin]]s among others, and&mdash;noting the strategic value of [[Harvestshield Mountain]]'s location for waging war on the [[Lords' Alliance]]&mdash;he claimed [[Chauntea's Citadel]] atop the mountain as his base of operations. He further sent his agents [[Snarlclaw]] and [[Grocknock]] to [[Frostsilver Mines]] to acquire ''Frostsilver armor'' and the [[Anvil of Dumathoin]]. Recognizing that these trolls and ettins would be ill-equipped to break through [[dwarf|dwarven]] metal doors, he arranged for [[rust monster]]s to accompany them. Unfortunately, this expedition caught the attention of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, who then sent [[adventurer]]s and an army to thwart the Legion at Harvestshield Mountain.\n\nEventually, Silverhand's adventurers breached the Citadel, and issued a challenge to Mrolgyet himself as they fought through his troops. Mrolgyet obliged to fight them personally, but was badly injured. He withdrew from the battle to recover, knowing that his Legion's discipline would hold, and sent his helmed horror \"champion\"&mdash;outfitted in Frostsilver armor&mdash;to represent him. The champion too was destroyed, and the Legion was pushed back. At this point, a new rival for Harvestshield Mountain appeared in the form of the [[red dragon]] [[Argathakul]], who asserted it as his territory. The dragon too was beaten back by the adventurers, and Mrolgyet's Legion was routed."
