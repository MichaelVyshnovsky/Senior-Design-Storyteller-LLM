        "mainbody": "'''Amelior Amanitas''' ({{Pronounce|ah|ME|lee|or|_|ah|mah|NEE|tass|refs=}}) was a male [[human]] [[wizard]] and the Sage of [[Secomber]].\n\n{{quote|''Who I am I, you ask. Let it be known, that I am Amelior Amanitas, alchemist extraordinaire and supreme sage of the North.''|Amelior Amanitas}}",
        "Description": "Amelior was a {{SI|6|ft}} tall, stocky man with a grey beard. Although he wore spectacles, he also wore a variety of eye patches over the other, each patch adorned in fanciful colors or decorations. His garb was generally that of a common craftsman.",
        "Personality": "An eccentric busy-body and an altogether nosy individual, Amelior's curiosity often rubbed folk the wrong way. Although bumbling and forgetful, he was also good-natured and straightforward with those he had dealings with.",
        "Abilities": "Despite his appearance, Amelior was a powerful [[wizard]], learned [[sage]], and a master [[alchemist]]. He specialized in the study of the physical universe but also had a great interest in the supernatural and bizarre phenomena. He disdained using his [[spell]]s for battle but rather he preferred to rely on [[adventurer]]s or bodyguards instead.{{Cite card/Spellfire: Master the Magic/Artifacts Chase|18/20}}",
        "Possessions": "In his tower in [[Secomber]], Amelior had a number of [[stone golem]]s under his command. Additionally, Amelior was noted for keeping a dozen [[cat]]s, each one a bright color: green, fuchsia, mint blue, flame-orange, red, sun yellow, ''etc''. \n\nOn his person, Amelior carried a pair of metallic flasks. The first was a copper flask that could unleash a pair of fanatically loyal [[ogre]] [[berserker]]s to fight for Amelior. Even after death, these ogres would rise again as [[monster zombie]]s to continue fighting. The second flask was made of gold and contained a [[djinn]] named [[Hasan (djinn)|Hasan]]; when opened, Hasan would appear to do Amelior's will. Additionally, Amelior wore a ''[[robe of deep pockets]]'' and ''[[bracers of defense]]''. At one time, Amelior kept a holy symbol of [[Mystra]] around his neck.\n\nAmelior had also created an [[iron golem]] and a number of two-headed golems to help defend the town in the event of an attack. Each of these golems appeared as enormous winged [[gargoyle]]s, though their wings could not make them fly.\n\nIn [[the Seven-Stringed Harp]] in Secomber, the glowing, floating harp that played in the tavern was actually a permanent spell of Amelior's creation.",
        "Relationships": "Although his inquisitive nature made him unwelcome around many, Amelior counted High Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]] as a close friend. Day-to-day, Amelior relied on his bodyguard [[Erek]] to keep him safe.\n\nIn his youth, Amelior was a pupil of a priest of [[Mystra]], known as Brother [[Felloman]].",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "In his youth, Amelior studied under a [[priest]] of [[Mystra]] called Brother [[Felloman]]. During this tutelage, he encountered a [[ghoul]] for the first time, who was once the moneylender [[Wexelar]], a man whom Amelior's father once owed much money to.\n\nEventually, Amelior gave up on being a priest and turned his hand to [[wizard]]ry. After a few years of studying [[the Art]], he was hired by a group of adventurers to find the ''[[golden eye of Rethekan]]'' in the ruins of [[Ascore]]. As the adventurers battled their way into the heart of the tomb, although one lost an arm to ''[[mummy rot]]'', they soon reached the lair of the [[mummy]], [[Rethekan]], Avenger of [[Bhaal]]. Whilst Amelior dawdled to collect curios, the rest of the party was overwhelmed by the formidable guardian and he was forced to bargain with the creature. Amelior tricked the blind Rethekan into releasing his allies and him, in exchange for a [[golden eye of Rethekan|glass eye]].",
            "Sage Supreme of the North": "At some point, Amelior investigated the ancient ruins of [[Old Owl Well]] where, although his findings were inconclusive, he believed the well was in some way magical. He found that nothing he could do would lower the water level of the well, even temporarily.\n\nOn [[Mirtul 8]], [[1357 DR]], Amelior Amanitas and his manservant, [[Erek]], embarked on a journey around the North. They departed in Amelior's flying gasbag, powered by an [[air elemental]] and a [[fire elemental]].\n\nIn [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], [[1358 DR]], Amelior returned to [[Secomber]] from his journey, along with his entourage of multicolored cats in tow.\n\nLater that same year,{{SavageGateway-time}} Amelior discovered that Zhentarim planned to locate four [[magic]]al statuettes that, together, could send monsters across the [[Anauroch]] desert. The Zhentarim kidnapped him from his room in the [[Vault of the Sages]], took him through [[Everlund]] and [[Llorkh]], and eventually imprisoned him in [[Zhentil Keep]]. \n\n[[File:RescueOfAmanitas.png|thumb|272px|right|''The Heroes of Ascore-to-be and Erek save Amelior Amanitas from Zhentarim agents.'']]\n[[Broadhand]], an acolyte of [[Bane]], had intercepted one of Amelior's letters detailing the Zhentarim's plans. As the [[Church of Bane]] were enemies of the Zhentarim, he informed a group of adventurers (the future [[Heroes of Ascore]]) pretending to be Banite priests all that he knew. He then sent them to speak with Amelior themselves, believing he would know of some way to stop their plans. Tracking him down to the Vault of the Sages, they found the scene of a struggle in his room. They then went on to find and rescue his manservant Erek, who informed them of what happened. Together they set off and rescued Amelior, who explained to the heroes how to stop the Zhentarim. He was then brought by Erek back to Secomber.\n\nThe Heroes of Ascore went on to slay the Zhentarim general [[Vaalgamon]]. Armies of Zhentarim troops then charged from the east and several mercenaries moved in from the south, aiming to salvage Vaalgamon's scheme. Amelior Amanitas hurriedly cast powerful spells to magically appear before the heroes and gave instructions on how to unite the statuettes with the ''ring of reversal''.\n\nA few weeks later, during the time of Autumn, Amelior summoned the Heroes of Ascore and gave them a quest to eliminate the last of the Zhentarim agents that remained in the city of Llorkh.\n\nLater that same year,{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} a man named [[Lychor]] introduced him to the fragmented legends of [[Awtawmatawn]], Amelior managed to merge them back together into an arm through use of [[potion]]s and after doing so they gave off a [[magic]]al aura. Amelior quickly became obsessed with the legend, thinking of the fame he would receive, though he would pass it off as being for the betterment of society.\n\n[[File:Shattered Statue NPCs.png|thumb|272px|right|''From left to right: [[Lychor]], Amelior Amanitas, and [[Valmous]].'']]\nAmelior quickly set about making a workshop in the village of [[Volkumburgh]], having a huge tower erected that was unlike any nearby building, and over time the topic of him, the golem, and its arm all became taboo topics.\n\nThat same year Amelior discover one of the statue's feet ({{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length) in a temple in [[Suzail]], which locals mistakenly believed to be a piece of [[Grumbar]]. In the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]], some time before the [[Feast of the Moon]], he arranged for the foot to be shrunken down, stolen, and then delivered to him by a group of [[adventurer]]s in Suzail. Estimating where the other fragments might be, he then tasked them with seeking out the rest of the fragments.\n\nThe adventurers succeeded in their quest and a few days later Amelia had the collected fragments all assembled. It was then that the golem's original creator, [[Valmous]], along with his disciples and an army of [[neanderthal]]s, attacked the village with the goal of destroying the Awtawmatawn. At the same time, Lychor unleashed a counter-force of [[undead]] in hopes of both protecting the golem and claiming it for himself. This horde of undead included a hundred [[skeleton]]s, twenty [[zombie]]s, and ten [[wight]]s. During this siege Awtawmatawn finally awakened and began to rampage around Volkumburg, destroying Amelior's workshop in the process.\n\nErek shielded him with his body as the building collapsed around them, saving Amelior but killing himself in the process. The adventurers he had hired found the injured wizard, who kept mumbling, \"Whatever shall we do, Erek? Whatever shall we do?\" At the time he was grappling with a number of complex emotions &mdash; grief over Erek's death, embarrassed and horrified at what he had unleashed, anger towards Lychor, and most of all uncertainty. Asking for his assistance and rummaging through his clothes, the adventurers were provided with a host of magical items to help them combat the golem.\n\nThose magical items included his ogre servants and Hasan, a brass bottle that unleashed a [[ballista]] with twenty bolts that was manned by four zombies, three [[Potion of growth|''potions of growth'']], three [[Potion of giant strength|''potions of giant strength'']],  and a potion labeled \"Drink Me If All Else Fails\" that would transform the imbiber into a [[red dragon]]. Ultimately, the adventurers prevailed and the golem was destroyed. The inhabitants of Volkumburg wanted to punish Amelior for all the destruction he caused. But he had used one of his exotic one-use artifacts to travel back in time, empty his workshop of important valuables, and then after returning to the present with them he escaped on his flying gasbag alongside a [[Resurrection (spell)|revived]] Erek.\n\nElminster was kind enough to shelter them as they tried to lay low from this incident. During this time Amelior agreed to a request by Elminster, due to his generosity, to provide [[Jennell Jaquays|some author]] from [[Earth|another Material Plane]] the wealth of information he had regarding the [[the North]] and its history.\n\nBetween 1358 DR and [[1370 DR]], Amelior Amanitas was actively interested in the legends of an enchanted wood somewhere within the [[High Forest]]."
