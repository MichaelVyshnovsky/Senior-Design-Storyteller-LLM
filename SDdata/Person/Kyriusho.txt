Kyriusho was an aloof and arrogant individual but actually fair-minded.
Kyriusho was the spirit of the volcano of Fochu Peninsula. He meditated inside the crater.
In ancient times, villagers of Fochu Peninsula occasionally offered human sacrifices to Kyriusho in order to win his favor.
In 1352 DR, he was disturbed by the arrival of the wu jen Setsu Iki. At first, he believed him to be an unasked-for sacrifice. In truth, Setsu wanted to use the power of the volcano to end the menace of Za-Jikku.
