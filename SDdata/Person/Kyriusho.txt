'''Kyriusho''' was a greater [[spirit]] of a volcano on [[Fochu Peninsula]], on the island of [[Tsukishima]] in [[Wa]].

==Personality==
Kyriusho was an aloof and arrogant individual but actually fair-minded.

==Activities==
Kyriusho was the spirit of the volcano of Fochu Peninsula. He meditated inside the crater.

==History==
In ancient times, villagers of Fochu Peninsula occasionally offered [[human]] sacrifices to Kyriusho in order to win his favor.

In [[1352 DR]], he was disturbed by the arrival of the [[wu jen]] [[Setsu Iki]]. At first, he believed him to be an unasked-for sacrifice. In truth, Setsu wanted to use the power of the volcano to end the menace of [[Za-Jikku]].
