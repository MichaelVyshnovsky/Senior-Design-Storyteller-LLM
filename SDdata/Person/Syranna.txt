'''Syranna''' was a rebel [[Red Wizard of Thay]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==Personality==
Syranna was honest and forthright but also cynical. Her experience in Thay convinced her that death was better than becoming an [[undead]] servant of [[Szass Tam]]. She was righteous but fatalistic, knowing that as a rebel leader against a extremely powerful wizard like Tam that her life could end at any time. For this she treasured every moment.

==History==
Syranna was a [[conjurer]] assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault under [[Thaymount]]. She was tasked with the mission of creating the Thayan gate to the [[Bloodgate]] elemental [[portal]] nexus. However, Syranna was secretly also the leader of a cell of the [[Thayan Resurrection]] and her true objective was to ruin Tam's plot.

In 1486 DR, a group of heroes from [[Daggerford]] destroyed [[Bloodgate Keep]]. She used her powers to save them from the crumbling keep by transporting them to [[Thay]].

Syranna asked for the heroes' help to destroy Doomvault in exchange for saving their lives, and she offered them all her support. She also told them that [[Shalendra Floshin]] and [[Kelson Darktreader]] had unfortunately been captured by the Szass Tam's [[necromancers]] upon arriving in Thay.
