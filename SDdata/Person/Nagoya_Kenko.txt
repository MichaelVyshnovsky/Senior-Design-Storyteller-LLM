'''Nagoya Kenko''' was the heir of [[Nagoya clan]] in [[Nakamaru]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Kenko usually spent more than he could afford on clothes. He was fascinated by mirrors, but only because he could see his reflection in them.

==History==
At a [[moon]]-viewing party, Kenko met the young [[Sumi-ko]], daughter of [[Funada Toyoo]]. She fell in love with Kenko and they soon started an illicit romance. However, [[Funada Genzo]] discovered the affair and, in order to protect his half-sister, payed a visit to Kenko and threatened him, but this only made Kenko angry.

==Personality==
Kenko was a spoiled child who grew to became a pompous and openly disrespectful individual. He secretly resented his father for his [[bamboo spirit folk]] heritage, but still exploited his father's love. He was a total cad who did not truly love Sumi-ko, only that his vanity was pleased by her attention.
