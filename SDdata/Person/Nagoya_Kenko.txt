Nagoya Kenko was the heir of Nagoya clan in Nakamaru in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Kenko usually spent more than he could afford on clothes. He was fascinated by mirrors, but only because he could see his reflection in them.
At a moon-viewing party, Kenko met the young Sumi-ko, daughter of Funada Toyoo. She fell in love with Kenko and they soon started an illicit romance. However, Funada Genzo discovered the affair and, in order to protect his half-sister, payed a visit to Kenko and threatened him, but this only made Kenko angry.
Kenko was a spoiled child who grew to became a pompous and openly disrespectful individual. He secretly resented his father for his bamboo spirit folk heritage, but still exploited his fathers love. He was a total cad who did not truly love Sumi-ko, only that his vanity was pleased by her attention.
