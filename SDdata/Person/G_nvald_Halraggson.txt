'''Bear King Günvald Halraggson''' ({{Pronounce|GOON|vald|_|hawl|ROG|sun|refs=}}) was the ruler of the [[Tribe of the Bear]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], in the years following the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Personality==
Günvald was a merciless and stalwart king who did his best to bring honor to his reign.

He didn't understand the "civilized" folks of the [[Ten Towns]] and stayed well away from their influence.

==History== 
For some time, Günvald led the Tribe of the Bear with his fellow chieftain [[Wolvig Barrundson]]. After Wolvig fell under the influence of the [[Auril]]ian [[Chosen]] known as the [[Ice Witch]] and perished, Günvald became the tribe's sole leader and Bear King.
