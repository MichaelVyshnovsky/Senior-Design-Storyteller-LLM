        "mainbody": "'''Olly''' was a smuggler working for a branch of the [[Zhentarim]] that operated on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Olly had a darkly olive skin tone and brown wavy hair. He wore a nondescript [[leather armor]] and carried a [[bow]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Olly was among smugglers who were, along with his superior, the Zhent agent named [[Rugan]], tasked with transporting a strongbox containing some [[iron flask|unknown item]] to [[Baldur's Gate]] and delivering it to a certain wealthy individual. When traveling along the [[Risen Road]] near [[Moonhaven]], Rugan's men were attacked by a band of savage [[gnoll]]s who served the fledging \"deity\" known as [[the Absolute]]. The men were forced to take refuge in a nearby cave and fight for their lives. Olly and Rugan were the last of the Zhents to survive; however, their fare remained ambiguous. According to some accounts, both Zhents survived the gnoll assault thanks to a group of [[True Soul]]s, while by others â€“ Rugan and Olly were killed. Olly could also had been accused of stealing the shipment by opportunistic and treacherous Rugan."
