        "mainbody": "Elder Reader '''Salyndra Shaern''' was a [[half-elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Oghma]] and of [[Corellon Larethian]] based at the [[House of Knowledge (Neverwinter)|House of Knowledge]] in [[Neverwinter]] in the late mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "The House of Knowledge was already being run by Chief Priest [[Watger Brighthair]] but, due to his youth, Salyndra was installed by the [[Church of Oghma]] to guide him. They continued to lead the temple together through the 1360s DR",
        "Activities": "The two priests offered education for free, with teaching sessions doubling as services to Oghma the Binder.\n\nAs well as guiding Watger, Salyndra's role was also to promote good relations between [[human]]s and [[elves]] in Neverwinter and to study human wisdom for the elves. In all three areas, she did well.",
        "Description": "A petite old woman, Salyndra had hair that was gray, long, and untidy and spoke in a dry tone. She wore plain dark [[robe]]s.",
        "Personality": "Although Salyndra had a cynical attitude and her advice was sharply incisive, at her core she was genuinely kind and a fast and loyal friend to travelers in need. [[Adventurer]]s she'd aided often returned to the House of Knowledge to update her on their triumphs and to pay her back via donations to the temple."
