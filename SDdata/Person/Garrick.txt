'''Garrick''' was a [[bard]] who traveled across [[west Faerûn]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"Music has charms to soothe the savage breast."''|Garrick}}

==Personality==
He was somewhat naive and too trusting of strangers. He enjoyed traveling and performing his music for others.

==History==
Garrick honed his musical talents studying at a college in [[Berdusk]].

He was once part of the [[Dale Wind Troubadours]], a traveling acting troupe who performed all along the Sword Coast, from [[Amn]] in the south to [[Neverwinter]] in the north. Although the Troubadours were a popular act who regularly performed for the higher classes, they also used their performances as distractions for theft. When Garrick learned of this he left the troupe in protest.

By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Garrick had taken up with actor and ne'er-do-well [[Silke Rosena]] in [[Beregost]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1369}} Garrick moved south to [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]], where he tried courting a [[paladin]] of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]]. Like Lady Alyth, she rebuffed his advances.
