'''Zomir''' was a [[Calishite]] [[human]] bounty hunter active in [[1357 DR]].{{Cite comic/Shackles of the Past |1-5, 7-9, cover}}

==Activities==
He was one of a trio of bounty hunters hired by Baron [[Abon Duum]] of [[Manshaka]] to recover or slay the escaped slave-gladiator [[Vajra Valmeyjar]]. In [[1357 DR]], they went to the [[Sel√ªne's Smile]] in [[Waterdeep]] and used a poison dart and a club to subdue Vajra and kidnap her, though even beaten and drugged she put up a fight.

[[Conner]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], and [[Salabak]] eventually caught up with the band, distracted them with the [[illusion]] of a [[dracolich]], and slew them with arrows, rescuing Vajra.
