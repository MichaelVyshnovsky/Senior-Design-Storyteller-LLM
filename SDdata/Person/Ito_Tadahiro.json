Thanks to an ''[[ancient curse]]'' and a [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]]'s influence, he did not truly die but instead lingered to haunt the castle as the third of the seven weapon masters of the castle. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] fought and destroyed him."
