        "mainbody": "Ito Tadahiro was a cursed samurai ronin in Ito-jo in 1360 DR.\nIto Tadahiro was a samurai general of the Ito family who died in the castles burning in 647 DR. Thanks to an ancient curse and a krakentuas influence, he did not truly die but instead lingered to haunt the castle as the third of the seven weapon masters of the castle. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed him."
