'''Roger''' was a pirate crew member of the ''[[Green Siren]]'' that sailed across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1396}}, the ''[[Green Siren]]'' came under attack by the forces of [[Gethshemeth]], a [[kraken]], during a rendezvous with the [[kuo-toa]] [[Nogah]] on [[Hegruth]], a hidden island of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. During the attack, he spotted a [[sea hag]] amongst the enemies; the hag killed him with a curse within moments.
