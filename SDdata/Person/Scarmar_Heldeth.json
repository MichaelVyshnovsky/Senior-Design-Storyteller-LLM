Scarmar Heldeth, together with Morligul Downdagger, assaulted the home where the man was staying, and took him captive along the way, they also captured Storm Silverhand and slew everyone there, save for the War Wizard Reldyk Applecrown, whose comatose body was actually harboring the mind of Elminster Aumar.\nHowever, knowing they had failed to capture or slay one of the people there, Scarmar Heldeth decided to flee the city, fearful of what the loose end may bring he had already been paid, and was less trusting of Traevyn Illances loyalty than his companion Downdagger was. He even cast a protective spell before leaving, not trusting Downdagger."
