'''Hawksar''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, while grumbling about how difficult it was to hunt down [[Elminster Aumar]], Hawksar was named by the War Wizard [[Eskrel Starbridge]] alongside [[Belandroon]] and [[Arbrace]] as one of the few War Wizards who might well be as competent as they thought themselves to be. All mages present grinned at that.
