        "Personality": "She enjoyed indulging in opulent pleasures, and used her position within Bezantur's temple to engage in such pursuits.",
        "Activities": "While she was technically the overseer of Lolth's temple in Bezantur, Triel only visited once every few months. Whenever she did, she would always select a handful of the [[human]] members of the congregation to accompany her back to the [[Underdark]] to \"live\" with their drow \"brethren\". Naturally, these chosen individuals they were never seen again."
