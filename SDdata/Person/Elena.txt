Elena was the elf cleric who fell in the Weeping War. As a ghost, she haunted the Dwarven Dungeons Turgilds Square underneath Myth Drannor.
In life, Elena used jasmine perfume. In death, the gentle comforting scent of the flowering plant followed her incorporeal form.
Elenas pewter locket was a delicate magical amulet that she gifted to her beloved at some point before their deaths. The item possessed enchantment that increased the wearers wisdom and intelligence.
Elenas lover Garras, was trapped in an existence as a ghost in the Dwarven Dungeons Halls of Stone.
Along with countless souls, Elena perished in the Weeping War, circa 714 DR.
In 1369 DR, Elena encountered the adventurers from Phlan seeking to stop the Cult of the Dragon plan of corrupting the elven citys mythal. She let them to Turgilds Square and asked for their aid in returning her favorite magic fountains from the lost days of the citys glory, back to function. The magical mechanism that powered the fountains was in the Dwarven Dungeons Deep Halls and guarded by a powerful dwarven statue golem called the Lifespring Guardian.
With Elenas cryptic advice, the adventurers found her beloveds final resting place, disturbed and defiled. They restored dignity to Garras dead body, receiving his ghosts gratitude. They did the same to Elenas defiled tomb in the Deep Halls. Both restless spirits, Elena and Garras lent their strength to the battle with the Guardian. Subsequently, the heroes defeated the golem, freeing Elena and her lover from their ghostly existence.
