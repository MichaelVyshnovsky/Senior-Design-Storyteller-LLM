'''Silverwing''' was a [[movanic deva]] that the [[giant]]s of [[Utgard]] kept prisoner for untold years as a twisted form of amusement, considering him a sort of jester for the fortress city.

==Description==
The body of Silverwing was kept [[chain]]ed to a high table. His wings were broken and in twisted angles, incapable of flight, having been deliberately crushed with rocks by his giant captors. The feathers on these wings were grimy and in near constant state of molting off.

==Reputation==
Over time a rumor developed that the feathers of this deva brought good luck to those that held them, though some giants refuted these claims.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|24}}

==History==
At some indeterminate time this movanic deva was ambushed by a group of giants and imprisoned in Utgard, where he was eventually given the name Silverwing by his captors. Over the many years of his confinement, the deva refused to speak a word."

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Silverwing was still being held captive within the walls of Utgard.The imprisoned deva mentioned in ''Three Coins in a Well'' is unnamed, but is presumed to be the same deva that was described in the Planescape boxset ''Planes of Chaos'' as being a prisoner in the city of Utgard. [[Torheim]], a [[proxy]] of the [[Norse pantheon|Norse power]] [[Thor]], came to learn about the imprisoned deva and scouted the area around the city{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|23}} in hopes of infiltrating it and rescuing him. Around this same time a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]], a city on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]], traveled to [[Ysgard]] in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} While traveling through [[Jotunheim]] they met Torheim and he asked the heroes if they could break into [[Okalnir|Brimir's hall]] and steal the deva feather from him, as having it would make it much easier for Torheim to track the deva down inside Utgard.
