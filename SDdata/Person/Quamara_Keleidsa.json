        "mainbody": "Quamara Keleidsa was a half-green-dragon moon elf of House Keleidsa in Arch Wood. She was a talented sorcerer, and had some skill as a fighter.\nQuamara was not always a half-dragon, nor did that power naturally awaken in her. However, due to her skill in the ways of dark sorcery, she transformed herself into one.  To do this, she called upon dark magic, and merged her body and soul with those of a green dragon.\nKeleidsa had a tiny viper familiar named Urlathan. She was romantically involved with a drow known as Trizeen. The dark sorceress had dealings with agents from the nation of Sembia and House Jaelre, which she preferred dealing with, compared to humans.\nAround 1372 DR, Quamara returned to one of her familys abandoned estates in the Arch Wood. The dark sorceress brought along her minions, including draegloths, half-dragon trolls, sword spiders, and her moon elf comrades.\nQuamara and her servants searched the estate and defeated a baelnorn that guarded it. Her group looted its treasures, then used the place as their base. Her minions raided caravans passing through the Archendale region, and they kidnapped artisans from the towns of Archenbridge and White Ford to restore the estate to its former glory. After the artisans performed their tasks, they were mercilessly slain.\nAs well as kidnapping and killing local craftsmen, they also disrupted local logging expeditions. The lumberjacks convinced the Swords of Archendale to send soldiers to search for Quamara and her minions. Patrols were sent to the woods containing the old Keleidsa estate, but it appeared to have vanished. The swords were reluctant about sending more of their men to their deaths, and so resorted to sending adventurers to do the job.\nSome time later, Keleidsa sold much of the ancient jewelry that she had recovered from the tomb. After evaluating the jewelry, a half-elf historian named Terallo Prylaster linked the wares to their location and became worried that bandits had been raiding these ancient ruins. Prylaster traced the particular jewels to the Keleidsa estate and also reached out to a group of adventurers in order to investigate it further.\nThe adventurers who were contacted by the Sword of Archendale and Terallo proceeded to root out the occupants. It was uncertain whether Quamara survived the ordeal."
