        "mainbody": "'''Ildar Orsabbas''' was a famous fence in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Ildar was a stout, fun-loving and somewhat pompous individual. He enjoyed attending parties in costume as the so-called \"Duke of Darkness\", where he could be found making threats, dancing, and seducing others.",
        "Activities": "Aside from staying in his shop, [[Orsabbas's Fine Imports]], Ildar spent most of his time going to parties in costume, where he always wore the guise that earned his namesake. He went to these parties to observe the tapestries, wine, and perfumes, as he specialized in fencing these items. He would buy such things with no questions asked, but if he recognized stolen goods, his prices was very low."
