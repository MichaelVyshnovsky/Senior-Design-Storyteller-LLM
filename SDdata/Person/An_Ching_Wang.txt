'''An Ching Wang''' was a [[kensai]] of the town of [[Cham Fau]] in the [[Ch'ing Tung]] province of [[Shou Lung]] and later a member of the Emperor's guard in the [[spelljammer]] spaceport city of [[Chunming]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Like her siblings, An Ching was trained in the martial arts by her father, Master Wang Ho of the [[Wang Ho School]] in Cham Fau. She garnered a reputation as an excellent warrior. An Ching fell in love with a fellow student of her father, Chien Jang Liang, though he was at first oblivious to her feelings.

However, when Chien injured Wang Ho in a training accident involving a deadly technique in {{YearlinkConvert|2606|SY}}, he dramatically abandoned the Wang Ho School to become a poor wanderer in penitence. At first, An Ching was torn but decided to follow him and look for a way for him to redeem himself. She'd been encouraged to "follow her heart" by a visiting [[Ladies of Compassion|White Lady]] of [[Nine Immortals|Kwan Ying]], who said "things would work out".

Things did not work out and, after following her lover to Chunming, An Ching enlisted in the Emperor's guard, becoming one of the first women to serve by {{YearlinkConvert|2617|SY}}. She also became betrothed to Yu Fu Tieh, a [[samurai]]. Coincidentally, he had also maimed her father in an apparent training accident, but in a dispute over taking kensai skills to space via spelljamming.

==Relations==
An Ching was the daughter of [[Wang Ho]] and the sister of [[Yen Tsu Wang]] and [[Ju Huo Wang]].The name 'An Ching Hua' is given for the sibling of Ju Huo Wang, who is the son of Wang Ho. Since An Ching Wang is the daughter of Wang Ho, it stands to reason these are the same person. The name is likely an error, but could be an alias or her mother's maiden name.

After loving [[Chien Jang Liang]],An Ching's lover is Chien Jang Liang in ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' Volume I and Yu Fu Tieh in ''Realmspace''. Both of them injured her father in a training accident and both left, with An Ching following. It seems likely that Chien was renamed; indeed, he appears on the same page as [[Yu Fu Fang]] and [[Hu Tieh]]. Regardless, they have different motives, classes, and personality details, so this wiki assumes they are separate characters for clarity, even if it suggests An Ching has a type.

==Description==
Small of build, she was considered lovely and beautiful.

==Personality==
Although she was charming, An Ching quickly grew irritated by men trying to flirt with her, not least because she was already betrothed.

==Activities==
She was among the kensai who guarded the spaceport at Chunming.<ref> She was known to be approachable and willing to share or sell information that was not considered secret or embarrassing to the government. She had learned some aspects of spelljamming from her father.
