        "mainbody": "'''Symvyn Rivenstone''' was a decorated [[deep gnome]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Many times, Symvyn had gained glory defending [[Blingdenstone]]. One time he used himself as bait in order to trap a very devious [[umber hulk]].\n\nIn [[1313 DR]], Symvyn was a member of an expedition led by Burrow Warden [[Belwar Dissengulp]] to mine some [[arandur]]. The [[drow]] priestess [[Yiccardaria|Iccara]] mentally dominated him, turning the deep gnome into her slave. However, the young [[Maltzabloc Riffenhammer]] noticed his strange behavior and expressed his suspicions to Belwar, but he was dubious. Later Symvyn reported the news to Iccara.\n\nSome time after, he was again called by Iccara together with [[Du'Quelve Hunzrin]], and forced to dispel the wards on the gnomes' outpost. But the drow [[Zaknafein]], [[Jarlaxle]], [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara was revealed to be a [[yochlol]]. Ultimately, Zak injured Du'Quelve and freed Symvyn."
