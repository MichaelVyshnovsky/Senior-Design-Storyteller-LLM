        "mainbody": "ymvyn Rivenstone was a decorated deep gnome in the early 14 century DR.\nMany times, Symvyn had gained glory defending Blingdenstone. One time he used himself as bait in order to trap a very devious umber hulk.\nIn 1313 DR, Symvyn was a member of an expedition led by Burrow Warden Belwar Dissengulp to mine some arandur. The drow priestess Iccara mentally dominated him, turning the deep gnome into her slave. However, the young Maltzabloc Riffenhammer noticed his strange behavior and expressed his suspicions to Belwar, but he was dubious. Later Symvyn reported the news to Iccara.\nSome time after, he was again called by Iccara together with DuQuelve Hunzrin, and forced to dispel the wards on the gnomes outpost. But the drow Zaknafein, Jarlaxle, Kimmuriel Oblodra suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara was revealed to be a yochlol. Ultimately, Zak injured DuQuelve and freed Symvyn."
