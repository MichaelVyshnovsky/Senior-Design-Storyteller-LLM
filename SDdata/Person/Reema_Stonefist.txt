Reema Stonefist was an Order of the Gauntlet fighter in 1489 DR.
Reema led an adventuring party for the Order of the Gauntlet. When the black dragon Throstulgrael, recently settled in Twilight Marsh near Phlan, started preying upon caravans, Reema and her men were ordered to find and defeat the dragon.
Later, fellow Gauntlet agent Zern Xerkstil asked an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragons lair to discovered what happened to the former party. The adventurers discovered that Reema and her fellows had been killed by kobold minions of the dragon.
