'''Minn''' was a [[forest gnome]] [[wizard]] specialized in [[illusion]] [[magic]].

==Possessions==
Minn supplemented her impressive magical skills with a ''[[deck of illusions]]'' to produce illusions of whatever (or whoever) she required at a moment's notice.

==History==
As a child, Minn enjoyed the company of a whole host of imaginary friends. As she grew older, she devoted her life to illusion magic to make her friends real&mdash;well, semi-real.
