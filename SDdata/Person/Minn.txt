Minn was a forest gnome wizard specialized in illusion magic.
Minn supplemented her impressive magical skills with a deck of illusions to produce illusions of whatever (or whoever) she required at a moments notice.
As a child, Minn enjoyed the company of a whole host of imaginary friends. As she grew older, she devoted her life to illusion magic to make her friends real&mdashwell, semi-real.
