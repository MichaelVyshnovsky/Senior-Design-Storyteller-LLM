She had light brown skin, curly brown hair, and brown eyes. Her ears were pierced with simple, tiny loop earrings.\nIn the , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldurs Gate closed the Wyrms Crossing bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Monifa Diallo, who inhabited the district, did not share its residents flaring xenophobia and showed disgust with the Upper City, believing it did not care for the looming danger and possible deaths of everyone in Rivington."
