        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldur's Gate closed the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Monifa Diallo, who inhabited the district, did not share its' residents' flaring xenophobia and showed disgust with the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]], believing it did not care for the looming danger and possible deaths of everyone in Rivington."
