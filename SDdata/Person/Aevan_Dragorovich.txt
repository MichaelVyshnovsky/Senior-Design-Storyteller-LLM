Aevan Dragorovich was a Raumviran inhabitant of Drubiev in the Hordelands in 1375 DR.
Aevan was the First Councilman of the Council of Five of Drubiev in 1375. Given Drubievs rapid growth in the years following the collapse of the Tuigan Horde, Aeven spent much of his time and energy keeping the citizens of Drubiev in check. Many of the citizens favored expansion, while the more conservative folk were opposed to this idea.
