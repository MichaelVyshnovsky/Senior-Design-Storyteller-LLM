        "mainbody": "Amethyst Trueblood was a gnome priestess active in the 14 century DR.\nAmethyst Trueblood disliked and mistrusted all elves after an elven thief once lifted her coin purse, armor, weapons, and even her holy symbol, leaving her defenseless in face of danger. Nevertheless Amethyst continued praying for the trickster elves salvation.\nAmethyst never went anywhere without her war pony named Stardancer. She usually was armed with throwing axes, a magical +2 shortsword, a magical +3 shield, and of course, her holy symbol."
