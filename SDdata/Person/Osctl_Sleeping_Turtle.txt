'''Osctl Sleeping Turtle''' was a ruler in [[Far Payit]] in [[Maztica]].

==History==
Osctl was one of the seven cheitains in the Ixtzul valley when the [[Star Worm]] fell from the sky. He was the first to reach the creature, still encased in a meteorite, and intended to make a bargain with the creature so he could gain power.

What happened afterward was unknown, except that the Star Worm was bound in a magical slumber. The city of Ixtzul was founded by Osctl's tribe over where it slept, and he became the first Revered Counselor of Ixtzul. By claiming that he had made a bargain with the Star Worm and it was their protector, the tribe gained power over the other tribes.
