'''Bolhur "Thunderaxe" the Clanless''' was a [[dwarf]] who was the father of [[Durlag Trollkiller]].

==History==
In his time, Bolhur "Thunderaxe" roamed [[Faerûn]], much like his son one day would, and was a well-respected dwarf.

Unfortunately, Bolhur's legacy would not be his achievements. He died whilst away in a distant land, with no home of his own. Although he had a son, Bolhur died alone with no dwarven family at his side. Thus, people would remember him as Bolhur the Clanless.

This lonesome death haunted his son Durlag, and the young dwarf vowed he would not share his father's fate nor travel so far. After completing many adventures himself, Durlag invested the wealth he had earned into a large [[Durlag's Tower|fortress]] to raise a clan of his own. The fortress even had a tomb for Bolhur. However, due to a number of tragic circumstances, Durlag did end up dying alone.

==Possessions==
Bolhur was known to wear a suit of [[enchanted]] [[plate mail]] armor known as ''[[The Practical Defense]]''. He commissioned it specially at high cost for the sake of defense, durability, light weight, and hindrance, with only a modicum of maintenance. It was the most prized, albeit least impressive, of all his armors.
