'''Alokkair''' also known as '''Alokkair the Wizard-King''' was once the ruler of the lost kingdom of [[Hlontar]] who lives on as a [[Lich]] within [[Shadowdale]].

==Appearance==
Alokkair was very tall, standing at 6'8", and had a long flowing white beard with long, wispy white hair. His skin was putrid gray, but otherwise whole, and had shrunken to wrap his horribly gaunt, bony frame. Alokkair's eyes glowed in their skeletal sockets. He wore long flowing robes of purple silk and thick gray musterdelvys that were frayed and stained with mildew around the edges.

==Personality==
Alokkair was a cold, brilliant, and sarcastic man who anticipated attacks and his opponent's strategies with cunning, yet paranoid ease. Alokkair was eloquent and persuasive, and enjoyed a good debate. He was driven by his greed for magic, with the intent of reclaiming his lost kingdom.

==Possessions==
The Wizard-king outfitted himself with differing items over the centuries but a few have been noted including a ''[[Ring of free action]]'', a ''[[Ring of spell turning]]'' and numerous [[magical]] [[scroll]]s. Alokkair hid his [[phylactery]] somewhere outside of his "Dread Lair".

==History==
Eight centuries ago, Alokkair came from the ruined kingdoms swallowed by [[Anauroch]] to the farmlands at the western edge of the [[Moonsea]] around the [[Tesh|River Tesh]]. He befriended a local lord by the name of [[Hlonagh]]. Together they conquered several other local lords and founded the kingdom of Hlontar in [[536 DR]], Year of the Laughing Lich. Soon after becoming Hlonagh's court wizard, Alokkair killed Hlonagh, took over his kingdom, and married his daughter, [[Shalaera]]. Shalaera gave him three daughters - [[Delartha]], [[Ilmeera]], and [[Alaphlame]]. Enraged at not having been provided a male heir, he turned Shalaera into a [[red dragon]] and made her attack a clan of nearby elves, where she was slain. .

Alokkair ruled his lands by eliminating any potential rivals that appeared until he was brought down by his own daughters in [[569 DR]]. During the coup he killed two of his three daughters by turning them into [[juju zombie|juju zombies]], then he fled to a [[Dread Lair of Alokkair|secret lair]] beneath [[Fox Ridge]] and plotted his revenge. The third daughter, Alaphlame, was either vaporized during the coup attempt or fled via magic. Eventually the cold hand of death crept up on him and Alokkair turned to the [[Necromancy|necromatic arts]] to preserve his existence as a [[lich]]..

By [[1374 DR]], Alokkair had been contacted by the [[Church of Shar]] via [[Esvele Greycastle]] who offered the Lich the secrets of the [[Shadow Weave]] in exchange for being allowed to build a [[The House of Night|temple]] within his lair. By hiding the Church of [[Shar]]'s activities from the inhabitants of Shadowdale, Alokkair played no small role in the conquest of Shadowdale.
