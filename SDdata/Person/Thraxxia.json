        "mainbody": "Thraxxia was a half-fiendish daughter of the demon lord Grazzt.\nThough she had no known succubus blood, Thraxxia physically resembled an alu-fiend, with an attractive, feminine human form, upsloping eyebrows and small, batlike wings. She was, however, far more powerful, having gained the might and magical powers of a nalfeshnee through trickery and guile.\nThraxxia was the daughter of Grazzt and a long-dead human monk. After killing three of her half-sisters to prove herself to her father, she then served as Grazzts personal assassin.\nDuring the imprisonment of Waukeen, Grazzt plotted to magically disguise Thraxxia as the goddess of wealth, counting on Lliira to transfer Waukeens portfolio to Thraxxia in Waukeens stead. This plot was thwarted by a band of adventurers in 1370 DR."
