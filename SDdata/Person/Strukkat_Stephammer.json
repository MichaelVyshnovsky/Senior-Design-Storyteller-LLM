        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Strukkat Stephammer had years worth of experience in artificery. However, he began experiencing failing eyesight, which diminished his capabilities to a degree. Despite that, he was still a skilled and hard worker. He made a living by selling his armorer's services to the adventurers and defenders of [[Neverwinter]]."
