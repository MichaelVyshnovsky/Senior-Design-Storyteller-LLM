'''Izac Uthor''' was a [[goblin]] commander who rose to power during the turmoil that wracked goblinkind near the lands bordering western [[Anauroch]] before the [[Battle of Bones]] occurred.

==Personality==
Izac was brutish and ambitious. He recognized the potential benefit of uniting a horde of goblins against a common "enemy."

==Activities==
In the winter of [[1089 DR]], Izac gathered his army near the abandoned village of [[Thandril]] near the northwestern portion of the [[Goblin Marches]].  His horde included 200,000 goblins and tens of thousands of [[orcs]] and other goblin kin.  This army called itself the [[Thugs of Uthor]].
