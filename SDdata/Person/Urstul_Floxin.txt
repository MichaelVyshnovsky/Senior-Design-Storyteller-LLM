'''Urstul Floxin''' ({{Pronounce|UR|stool|_|FLOX|in|refs=}}) was a high-ranking member of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
In {{Yearlink|1492}},{{WDH-time}} Urstul Floxin was the leader of the Zhents headquartered in the villa of the [[Gralhund]] family. From there, he directed the search for the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', which was in possession of the [[gnome]] [[Dalakhar]].

However, not fully trusting Urstul, [[Yalah Gralhund]] also sent one of her personal servants, a [[nimblewright]] with a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]'', to search for the [[rock gnome]]. Floxin and two of his minions managed to ambush Dalakhar but then a ''[[fireball]]'' launched by the nimblewright killed the rock gnome and ten more people, including the two Zhent minions. Despite some injuries, Urstul survived and finally took the ''Stone''.

Then, finally in possession of the ''Stone'', Urstul went to question Yalah about the nimblewright. However, she took advantage of his injures and took the ''Stone'', triggering the events of the confrontation later known as the [[Gralhund Villa Bloodbath]].

Urstul was confined in the villa's parlor but managed to kill the guards and escaped.

Next, he tried to find Lord [[Orond Gralhund]], who was hidden in one of the guest rooms, with a plan to capture and trade him to get back the ''Stone''. There Urstul was possibly confronted and defeated by some adventurers.

If he survived, Urstul retreated to [[Kolat Tower]] with his master [[Manshoon]].

==Personality==
Urstul was truly loyal to Manshoon, even after being punished. He was a charming and dangerous individual. 
 
==Relationship==
Urstul received his orders directly from a [[simulacrum]] of Manshoon. He had a collection of black [[flying snake]]s that he used as couriers.
