Urstul Floxin () was a high-ranking member of the Zhentarim in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
In , Urstul Floxin was the leader of the Zhents headquartered in the villa of the Gralhund family. From there, he directed the search for the Stone of Golorr, which was in possession of the gnome Dalakhar.
However, not fully trusting Urstul, Yalah Gralhund also sent one of her personal servants, a nimblewright with a necklace of fireballs, to search for the rock gnome. Floxin and two of his minions managed to ambush Dalakhar but then a fireball launched by the nimblewright killed the rock gnome and ten more people, including the two Zhent minions. Despite some injuries, Urstul survived and finally took the Stone.
Then, finally in possession of the Stone, Urstul went to question Yalah about the nimblewright. However, she took advantage of his injures and took the Stone, triggering the events of the confrontation later known as the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath.
Urstul was confined in the villas parlor but managed to kill the guards and escaped.
Next, he tried to find Lord Orond Gralhund, who was hidden in one of the guest rooms, with a plan to capture and trade him to get back the Stone. There Urstul was possibly confronted and defeated by some adventurers.
If he survived, Urstul retreated to Kolat Tower with his master Manshoon.
Urstul was truly loyal to Manshoon, even after being punished. He was a charming and dangerous individual. 
Urstul received his orders directly from a simulacrum of Manshoon. He had a collection of black flying snakes that he used as couriers.
