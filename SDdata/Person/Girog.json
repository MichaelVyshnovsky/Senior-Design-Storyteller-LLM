        "mainbody": "Girog was a hill giant who lived in Chief Grootes steading, and was one of the highest ranking food gatherers in his community.\nIn 1366 DR, at a point when he was considered elderly for his race, Girog began routinely meeting in secret with some rogues from Hartsvale. He would purchase stag meat from them that they had poached from the royal forests of King Camden.\nGirog traded this illegal meat with the glutton Gorgg, under the promise that he would be given the unusually tender foodstuffs he needed to win an ordning challenge and thus rise in the hill giant social strata to the class of glutton."
