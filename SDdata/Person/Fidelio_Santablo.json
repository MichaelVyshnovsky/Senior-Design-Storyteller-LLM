        "mainbody": "idelio Santabalo was a paladin of Tyr who tried to single-handledly rid Undermountain of evil, but in the process fell victim to a curse and became trapped as a ghost within its depths.\nFidelios spirit appeared to people in the form of a man with a thin face, sunken cheeks, and ragged stubble. His ghost dressed in shining armor befitting a knight, but pitted and scarred, with the balanced scales symbol of Tyr emblazoned on the breastplate. Along with this he wore a tunic that appeared stained and rotting, a hole torn where a symbol would have been, and carried a dented shield.\nThe air around his spirit reeked of cheap cologne\nIn life, Fidelio had always been certain of his superiority over his fellows and unabashed by the criticisms of friends and foes. In undeath, although he was not evil, he was willing to do anything to break his curse, even endangering innocents.\nFidelio in life was a paladin of a god of justice. He went to Undermountain to battle evil. There, he fought a powerful fiend of the nether planes to a stalemate. He asked his gods help to win, but after the victory Fidelio was arrogant and belittled his foe. So his god decided to punish him by cursing him he was condemned to wander Undermountain as a ghost and punish braggarts like himself by teleporting them into dangerous spots of the dungeon.\nFor decades, Fidelio wandered the dungeon, but the magic energies unleashed by the death of Halaster Blackcloak in 1375 DR weakened his curse and amplified his teleportation powers. He had identified three magical objects that combined could break his curse, but needed someone with a physical body to recover them.\nFidelio used his teleport powers to send braggarts, and also people with them, into dangerous spots in the dungeon."
