Lord '''Derrick Lurian''' was a noble of House [[Lurian]] in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite document/Procampur City Expansion Packet|9}}{{Cite web/House Lurian}}

==Relationships==
He was a relative of Lord Consul [[Povalo Lurian]], the head of the family.While several members of House Lurian are known, most of their relationships are unknown; Derrick is most likely intended to be a son of Povalo and [[Jasmine Lurian]].

==History==
One weekend in the late 1360s DR, Derrick Lurian joined a hunting trip in the nearby woods with several other nobles of Procampur, as well as [[Rendeth of the Royal Blood|Thultyrl Rendeth]], ruler of the city. Derrick, Rendeth, [[Zinzann Allison]], and others set off into the woods and caught a number of [[deer|bucks]], a [[griffin]], and a [[peryton]]. However, a howl spooked Zinzann's horse, causing it to flee with rider deep into the woods. The others found him hours later, in shock and with shredded clothes, babbling and unable to say what had happened to him. Derrick related what had happened to the nobles who'd stayed behind, and [[Endoria Fairwelker]] later reported on the hunting trip in the ''[[Procampur Shining Jewel]]'' newspaper.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Grimm Determination|26}}

He was aged 27 in [[1370 DR]].
