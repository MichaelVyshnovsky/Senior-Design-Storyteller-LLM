Procampur, the Vast
Lord Derrick Lurian was a noble of House Lurian in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the late 14 century DR.
He was a relative of Lord Consul Povalo Lurian, the head of the family.While several members of House Lurian are known, most of their relationships are unknown Derrick is most likely intended to be a son of Povalo and Jasmine Lurian.
One weekend in the late 1360s DR, Derrick Lurian joined a hunting trip in the nearby woods with several other nobles of Procampur, as well as Thultyrl Rendeth, ruler of the city. Derrick, Rendeth, Zinzann Allison, and others set off into the woods and caught a number of bucks, a griffin, and a peryton. However, a howl spooked Zinzanns horse, causing it to flee with rider deep into the woods. The others found him hours later, in shock and with shredded clothes, babbling and unable to say what had happened to him. Derrick related what had happened to the nobles whod stayed behind, and Endoria Fairwelker later reported on the hunting trip in the Procampur Shining Jewel newspaper.
He was aged 27 in 1370 DR.
