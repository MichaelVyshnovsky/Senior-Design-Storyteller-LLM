        "mainbody": "ady Alauthshaee was an elf notorious for both her wealth and the manner of her death.\nOver her lifetime, Lady Alauthshaee married no less six husbands, and outlived each and every one of them. Each time, she took her deceased husbands fortune as her own, growing extremely wealthy in the processed. For this reason, she was infamous to the elves.\nYet it was one of those she scornfully rejected, the elven mage Ilthuryn, who outlived her. Enraged, Ilthuryn attacked her with his spells as she rode in her flying carriage. It reportedly crashed to earth within Dead Tree Hollow in the Vast. Ilthuryn then used his magic to bury the carriage, the guards, and Alauthshaee herself alive. The spell-battle left a dead-magic zone over the whole valley. This took place a very long time before the 14 century DR, but still within elven memory.\nBy 1370 DR, the flying carriage of Lady Alauthshaee and the great treasures within still had not been found, but were thought to be buried or sunk in a pond somewhere in Dead Tree Hollow. It also possibly still contained the bodies of Alauthshaee and her guards. Adventurers occasionally came to search the valley for it.\nAlauthshaee was described as haughty.\nVia her husbands, Alauthshaee had acquired extreme wealth. She owned a magical flying carriage of elven design dating back to ancient times, which on its last journey was packed with her jewelry and silk gowns decorated with gems."
