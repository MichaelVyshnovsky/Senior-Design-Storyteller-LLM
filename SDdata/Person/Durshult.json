        "mainbody": "'''Durshult the Mage''', also known as '''Durshult the Doomweaver''', was a mage who was active several centuries before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nAn infamous \"spellslinger\", Durshult made a living by challenging other mages to [[spell]] battles and, when victorious, stealing all their [[magic]].\n\nAt last, however, Durshult lost a duel to another mage,In very similar stories, ''[[Menzoberranzan (boxed set)|Menzoberranzan: The City]]'' (1992), page 94, says Durshult the Mage was defeated and turned into a wonder by Haleera Shundyl, while ''[[Secrets of the Magister]]'' (2000), page 29, says Durshult the Doomweaver was turned into a wonder after being defeated by Rarimmon Tlarn. It is unclear which this should be. While it is possible these are alternative or changed versions, it is also possible Durshult was defeated by Rarimmon, then defeated by Haleera, then turned into a wonder by Haleera."
