'''Myudo Ichiro''' was an old man living in [[Myudo]] village in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Ichiro lived with his aged wife, his daughter, and the husband of the daughter.

In 1357 DR, Myudo village fell under the control of the [[dai-oni]] master of the [[Black Temple]] and his minions. Six months later, Ichiro met at the village's gate some adventurers. He invited them to his home at night. At his home, Ichiro told them all about the oppression of the dai-oni.
