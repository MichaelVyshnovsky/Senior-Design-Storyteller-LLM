'''Froya Harmoot''' was a [[Reghedmen]] [[human]] and the mistress of [[Jarund Elkhardt|King Jarund Elkhardt]] from the [[Tribe of the Elk]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Circa {{YearlinkName|1485}}, hushed whispers among the tribe suggested that Froya had mothered a child for King Jarund Elkhardt, potentially weakening his wife [[Wynneth]]'s standing.[[Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden]] takes place in the winter of 1489 DR or later. According to the writers, the date is unimportant, so the adventure can technically take place later..
