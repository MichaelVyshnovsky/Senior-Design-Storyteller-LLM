'''Otsabe Kanchi''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Tsu family]] and the [[zussho]] of [[Iyo]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
In Iyo, he led a company of two samurai and ten [[bushi]], all loyal only to him.

==Personality==
Otsabe was an ambitious man. He cared almost nothing for the Tsu family, not even sending them all of the tax income. He preferred to act as an ally to [[Niwa Hirotada]] and all Niwa retainers were welcomed in his house.
