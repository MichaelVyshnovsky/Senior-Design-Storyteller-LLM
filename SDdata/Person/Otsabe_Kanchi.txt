Otsabe Kanchi was a samurai retainer of the Tsu family and the zussho of Iyo in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In Iyo, he led a company of two samurai and ten bushi, all loyal only to him.
Otsabe was an ambitious man. He cared almost nothing for the Tsu family, not even sending them all of the tax income. He preferred to act as an ally to Niwa Hirotada and all Niwa retainers were welcomed in his house.
