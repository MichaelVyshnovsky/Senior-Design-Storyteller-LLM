        "History": "Otaehryn born in [[512 DR]]. At a very young age, he was chosen to become the Akh'Velahr's second-in-command thanks to the loyalty of his troops and the trust of his mentor, [[Daratrine Xantrani]] (the commander of [[Semberholme]]'s [[Moonshadows]]). This decision angered many [[sun elves]] of ancient Houses but Otaehryn was shielded by the favor of the [[coronal]] and the support of his troops.\n\nOtaehryn was among the non-sun-elf clan heirs who in [[666 DR]], after the death of Coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], tried to gain access to the [[Rule Tower]] but was killed together with the heirs of the [[Aunglor]], [[Iliathor]], [[Maerdrym]], [[House Nightstar|Nightstar]], and [[Omberdawn]] clans.",
        "Relationship": "Otaehryn was heir to the [[House Hawksong |Hawksong]] clan despite born from an illicit liaison between his father and the [[wild elf]] mistress [[Axilya Laenye]] because he was the only son of the Clan Lord.",
