Sadly for [[Ivrin]], it does not look like Betty is among them.''|[[Raegen Brunegar]]}}",
        "History": "On one rainy day in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Betty, along with two other fellow cows, were watched by Ivrin the Shepherd as they grazed on the lush green grass of the Wild Pastures, west of the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]]. Suddenly, Ivrin heard strange giggling and Betty \"went poof,\" as the shepherd later claimed. The mystery of disappearing cattle attracted the attention of the [[Hero of Daggerford]], who met with Ivrin to discuss poor Betty's fate. Eventually, the Hero's investigation revealed that a tribe of goblins armed with a magical brew that rendered cattle ''[[invisible]]'' was abducting animals off pastures to feed an army of [[orc]]s and [[tanarukka]] of the devil [[Gorgomorz]]. The every-hungry horde was assembling to attack the nearby city of [[Daggerford]]."
