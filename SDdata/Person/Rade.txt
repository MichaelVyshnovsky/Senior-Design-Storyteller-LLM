'''Rade''' was a [[werewolf]] servant of [[Selûne]], who was part of the [[New Moon Pact]] in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As a werewolf, Rade appeared as a bulky black [[wolf]].

==History==
Rade served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faith's enemies with exceptional cunning and violence. In [[757 DR]], the High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in [[Chancelgaunt]] declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Rade and many other members were hunted down, with Rade killed before he could be captured.

When [[Feena Archwood]] investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in [[1373 DR]], Rade's spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered [[Velsinore]]'s heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feena's spirit was met by a [[Shards|Shard]] escort to the afterlife, but Rade and the other Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of [[Julith Harkspur]]'s healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.
