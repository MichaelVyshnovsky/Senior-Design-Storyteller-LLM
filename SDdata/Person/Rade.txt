Rade was a werewolf servant of Selûne, who was part of the New Moon Pact in the 8 century DR.
As a werewolf, Rade appeared as a bulky black wolf.
Rade served Selûne as a werewolf of the New Moon Pact, fighting against the faiths enemies with exceptional cunning and violence. In 757 DR, the High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn of Bright Ladys Tower in Chancelgaunt declared the New Moon Pact a heresy, and Rade and many other members were hunted down, with Rade killed before he could be captured.
When Feena Archwood investigated the mystery of the New Moon Pact in 1373 DR, Rades spirit appeared in her dreams alongside the other members of the Pact to defend and guide her. After she uncovered Velsinores heresy and they mutually slew each other, Feenas spirit was met by a Shard escort to the afterlife, but Rade and the other Pact members encouraged her to return to life and join the New Moon Pact herself. With the aid of Julith Harkspurs healing, Feena was revived and ultimately continued the legacy of the Pact.
