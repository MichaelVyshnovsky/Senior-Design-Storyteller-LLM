'''Eined Datharathi''' was a member of the [[Datharathi]] chaka of [[Vaelan]] in [[Durpar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Darkvision||7}}

==Relationships==
She was the older sister of [[Warian Datharathi]].{{cite book/Darkvision||10}} and Warian lost an arm in a mining accident, Eined encouraged her brother to see the world.

==History==
In the spring of {{yearlinkName|1374}}, she fled her home, suspicious that something was controlling her family members through the crystal in their [[plangent]] bodies.{{cite book/Darkvision||12}} During this time, she found [[Ususi Manaallin]] and [[Iahn Qoyllor]] outside of the [[Body Shop]]; she quickly approached them for help in shutting down the crystal's production.{{cite book/Darkvision||11}}

Eined Datharathi was slain by her grandfather, [[Shaddon Datharathi]], in [[Tarsakh]] of 1374 DR after allowing the two [[Deep Imaskari]] with her inside Shaddon's chambers.{{cite book/Darkvision||23}}<ref group="note" name="n1">Per ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', [[Pandorym]] is sealed on [[Tarsakh 19]], and the sealing occurs during the fight in which Shaddon is slain. Thus, since there is barely a day of difference between her death and his, she was slain on either Tarsakh 18 or 19. Her uncle, [[Zeltaebar Datharathi]], wanted to elevate her to the status of a family saint after her death, while Ususi Manaallin meant for her name to be remembered amongst the greatest heroes of her people.{{cite book/Darkvision|249}}
