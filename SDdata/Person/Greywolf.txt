Greywolf was a famous bounty hunter who operated in the Lands of Intrigue in western Faer√ªn during the latter half of the 14 century DR.
Greywolf was a fallen ranger who succumbed to the desire of money and celebrity. He was recruited by the Shadow Thieves as a bounty hunter, usually tracking prey in the Forest of Tethir or spying on the local druidic circles.
Around the year 1368 DR, Greywolf was hired to kill an artist named Prism and retrieve some valuable gem stones that he had stolen. In a case of mistaken identity, the Bhaalspawn known as Gorions Ward was also given this job by an agent named Oublek.
At some point in his career, Greywolf came into the possession of the +2 magic longsword, Varscona.
