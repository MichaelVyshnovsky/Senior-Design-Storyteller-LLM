Ghzermag the Wild was a powerful warrior of the [[Batiri]] [[Shattered Spear tribe]] in [[Chult]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

{{quote|''Vrak! Khar tummum drak - varmoc! Dharmoc nuchek sintogub nuyeb, heehee!''|Ghzermag the Wild}}

==Description==
Unlike other members of his tribe, Ghzermag was strangely massive, especially for a [[Batiri]]. He towered over his kin and was about the same size or bigger than an average [[human]]. The warrior had a wild and unnerving personality. He constantly growled and giggled to himself.

==Possessions==
Ghzermag the Wild was armed with a huge [[greataxe]] and wore a set of simple [[hide armor]].

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, the Shattered Spear tribe came across the shipwreck of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', a vessel that belonged to [[Sa'Sani]]'s trade company. The Batiri attacked the survivors, including the infamous author [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Some of the survivors ended up captured by Taelunangul's goblins along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by Ghzermag, [[Clawkeeper Kzheemoc]], and [[Shoudul of the Skulls]]. Volo tried to persuade the charming locals to let the survivors go, but Ghzermag the Wild spoke not a word of [[Common]], and Volo was not as proficient in [[Goblin language]] as he claimed to be. In the ensuing fight, Ghzermag and his kin were slain.
