Doumwielle Armgo was the daughter of Sinnafain, an elf in the Moonwood, and Tosun Armgo, a renegade drow.
Doumwielle had silvery skin. She was a battle mage.
Doumwielle was somewhat fearful and doubtful of her decision to join the drow, but her sword, Khazidhea, gave her confidence and courage. She loved rabbits.
In 1484 DR, Doumwielle won the "contest" for her fathers sword, Khazidhea. Her brother Teirflin tried to stab her with Khazidhead while she slept she was quicker and slew him instead. He then joined with Doumwielle and led her into the Underdark, where they wished to join Tosuns house, House Barrison DelArmgo. However, Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre assigned them to the recreated House DoUrden They and Ravel Xorlarrin subsequently accompanied the orc warlord Hartusk across the Silver Marches to supervise his armies. She also posed as a representative to her mother (the leader of the Moonwood) and directed King Bromm into a situation that resulted in his death.
In 1485 DR, Doumwielle had Khazidhea knocked from her hands into the river. However, she could not resist its telepathic intrusions for long and returned to retrieve it. After her fathers death, she decided to join Tiago Baenre in his hunt for Drizzt DoUrden in order to gain revenge.
Doumwielle wielded the sentient sword Khazidhea, which had been wielded by her father before her, and Catti-brie before that. Her sword spoke to her in her fathers voice and disliked it when she used magic rather than sword-fighting skills.
Doumwielles father, Tosun Armgo, seemed to genuinely care for her. He called her "my little Doe" and tried to toughen her up when they returned to Menzoberranzan.
