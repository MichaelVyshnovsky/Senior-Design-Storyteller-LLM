Vargor was an ogre in the late 15 century DR who was one of the Burntbone Hordes many leaders. He helped lead its forces in occupying Sharpstone Keep, from where he oversaw banditry operations on the road to Waterdeep.
Vargor wielded a large, two-headed battleaxe.
He was slain by adventurers on the orders of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep after they drove his goblin and kobold bandit underlings back to the Keep.
