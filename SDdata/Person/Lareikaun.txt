Lareikaun was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Presumably, he had abilities to divine something about dead bodies.
He was known by name to Glathra Barcantle.
In the wake of the violence that erupted during the Council of the Dragon, Glathra Barcantle wanted to make sure Lareikaun and Yarjack Blamreld checked the bodies of the lords that died during the attempt on King Foril Obarskyr Is life.
