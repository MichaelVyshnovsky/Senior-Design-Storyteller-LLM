        "mainbody": "Viglor was a criminal member of the Night Masks of Westgate, active circa 1371 DR.\nBefore her departure from Westgate, Rinara, the Lady of Shivs worked alongside Viglor as a collector for their guild. They collected money from businesses who paid for protection. Those who refused faced Rinaras and Viglors blades. The collectors would remove the victims body parts, non-essential bits first. Unlike his partner, Viglor found sinister enjoyment in mutilation and torture on behalf of the Night Masks. When Rinara displeased the leadership of the Night Masks, Viglor found out that the guild was getting ready to cut the ties with her, as well as her jugular. Viglor warned his partner, allowing her to flee Westgate."
