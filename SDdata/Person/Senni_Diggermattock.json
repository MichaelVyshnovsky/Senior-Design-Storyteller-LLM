She also managed the commerce routes to Mithral Hall, Gauntlgrym, and Mantol-Derith, and helped maintain the magical defenses of the city.\nSenni valued and counted everything, to be sure that Dorbo had all he needed. She was devoted to the vision of a rebuilt Blingdenstone.\nDorbo and Senni were capable miners, with Senni acting as administrator. With the money they gathered, Dorbo and Senni planned the reclamation of Blingdenstone. They pondered the reclamation mission for ten years, in order to consider all the dangers. Afterward, they led a contingent of settlers to Blingdenstone, slowly reclaiming parts of the city.\nCirca 1486 DR, Senni faced many threats."
