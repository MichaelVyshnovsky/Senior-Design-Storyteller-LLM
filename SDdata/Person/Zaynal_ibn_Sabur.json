        "mainbody": "Zaynal ibn Sabur was one of Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahirs wives in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nZaynal was a dark and passionate beauty and one of Khalils favorite wives. She moved with the sultry, predatory grace of a hunting cat.\nZaynal had a fiery temper that mellowed a bit over the years to the point where she tolerated Khalils younger wives and concubines.\nTrained in Kadarasto, she was a legendary dancer of the highest proficiency.\nDuring her first decade in the Royal Harim, Zaynals rivals were known to disappear for days at a time. Upon their return, these shaken rivals always deferred to Zaynal with respect.\nOnly two people knew Zaynals true identity&mdashthe Grand Vizier and Khalils maternal aunt, Sitt Rahmah. Zaynal was in fact a holy slayer of the Soft Whisper, sworn to protect the Grand Caliph. Zaynal had 50 slaves at the Royal Harim, all of whom were female holy slayers as well."
