Squid was a half-elven barkeep at the Stable Quiver.
Squids namesake was a squid-shaped birthmark on his face.
Squid was acquainted with Oppal DeScart, a doppelganger agent of Acquisitions Incorporated, and was aware of her disregard of the law. He did, however, recognize that she would never commit murder.
