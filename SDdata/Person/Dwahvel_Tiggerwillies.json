She did not entertain many who were not halflings.\nShe was a cousin of Dondon Tiggerwillies.\nArtemis Entreri considered her a friend (his first real friend) and spoke openly with her, sharing opinions and thoughts that he shared with nobody else.\nShe was very good at procuring information, and was used frequently for this purpose by Artemis.\nShe informed Artemis about his situation when he was \"kelp-enwalled\", and when Merle Pariso, a battle mage from the Basadoni Guild, sought to kill him.\nShe helped Artemis with his plan to escape from Calimport by obtaining information about Cadderly Bonaduce, feeding misinformation to Sharlotta Vespers, and by procuring a copy of the Crenshinibon."
