Ser '''Agin Lamarck''' was a nobleman and historian at [[Mantor's Library]] in [[Phlan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|74}}

==Description==
He had a thin face framed by long black hair and illuminated by penetrating emerald eyes.

==Personality==
Agin was a pessimistic and sardonic individual that was not particularly easy to like. He acted like the consumate spoiled nobleman that were so-often found throughout the Realms. The personality developed was nothing but fa√ßade, created to protect his secret: his family's claim to nobility was false, as his grandmother had altered their genealogies in order to claim descent from the deceased [[House Lamarck]].

==Possessions==
The discerning nobleman wore the finest clothes befitting a man of his social stature. He decorated himself many over-the-top rings, one of which was associated with the [[Lords' Alliance]] of the [[Sword Coast]].

==Activities==
His passion was detailing all the genealogies of the families of Phlan. During the day however, he worked in a shop in [[Podol's Plaza]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|11-12}}

Agin was a secret member of Lords' Alliance, an organization that normally did not tolerate deception amongst its members.
