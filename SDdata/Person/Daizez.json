        "mainbody": "'''Daizez''' was a [[dwarf]] historian of [[Clangeddin's Hearth]], an organization of descendants of [[Clan Melairkyn]] who were attempting to reclaim their ancestral homes in [[Undermountain]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Daizez's written work, ''[[A Brief History of Undermountain]]'', was instrumental in assembling the dwarves who would become Clangeddin's Hearth. The book was written shortly after [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s disappearance from [[Underdark]] in [[1369 DR]] and called the nationalistic and religious dwarves to reclaim the ancient territories and holy grounds of Clan Melairkyn. The campaign was cut short in [[1370 DR]], when most members of Clangeddin's Hearth were slaughtered by Matron [[Azurna]]'s [[drow]] troops. It was very likely Daizez was one of the fallen."
