        "Activities": "The Coral Princess ruled her province from the city of [[Lipo]] on the coast of [[Pearl Bay]]. Perhaps because of the distance separating her from the heart of the [[Yikarian Empire]], the Coral Princess was rather liberal and accepting compared to her kin. She traded freely with foreigners from the barbarian north, whereas most yak-folk of the \"heartlands\" would enslave any foreigner on sight."
