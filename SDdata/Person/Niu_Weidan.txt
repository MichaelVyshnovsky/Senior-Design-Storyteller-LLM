'''Niu Weidan''' was a [[thief]] of antiquity from the nation of [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]] who lived many generations before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Countless years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Niu Weidan made a name for himself as a notorious thief who wielded a powerful and deadly weapon â€“ ''[[The Jade Fang]]''. He used the [[dagger]]'s magics to ''[[paralyze]]'' his opponents and then draining their life force to restore his own fleeting vitality. In the end, Niu Weidan's life was taken by the old age and not by an angry blade. Niu Weidan's descendants kept the ''The Jade Fang'' as a family heirloom for many generations, never using it in combat.
