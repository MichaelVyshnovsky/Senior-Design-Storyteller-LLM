        "mainbody": "eron Angalen was a half-orc bounty hunter of the late 15 century DR.\nHe was originally from Silverymoon. Unlike many half-orcs who were the result of a non-consensual union between a human female and a male orc, Verons orcish mother and human father were married and loved each other.\nIn 1478 DR, Veron accepted a commission to track down a supposedly mad woman named Nestrix who had killed a wizard in Cormyr. He tracked her to Waterdeep and, while attempting to apprehend her, became caught up in a plot by a green dragon, Andareunarthex, to steal magic items that would allow him to bypass Waterdeeps dragonward.\nVeron helped rescue Nestrix, who was really a blue dragon that had been plaguechanged into a human woman, from Andareunarthex. Later, he helped to defeat the green dragon and drive him from Waterdeep."
