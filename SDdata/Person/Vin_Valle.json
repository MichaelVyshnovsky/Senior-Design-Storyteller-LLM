She purchased at least one painting from the artist â€“ the piece titled ''[[Reflections on Umberlee]]''. Some time later the same year, they were invited to attend the art show titled \"Strange Tides: Self-Portraits from the Sword Coast,\" hosted by Lady Jannath in her [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] estate. ''Reflections on Umberlee'' was one of the paintings on display and the hostess asked her butler, [[Tarhun Mnemonis]], to remind the artist of that upon arrival."
