        "History": "In [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}},{{LCRB}} Myra Miller received a mention in that month's issue of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter''. After the offices of the ''Trumpeter'' were ransacked and torched (evidently by [[Talassan]]s) while the staff were away at the local printer's shop, Myra, a simple clerk, showed quick thinking and managed to save the broadsheet's documents from being destroyed. Despite Myra Miller's best efforts, all reports of the summer [[meteor]] crisis of the {{YearlinkName|1367}} were lost."
