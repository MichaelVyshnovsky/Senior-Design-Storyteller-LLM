        "Personality": "Kueh-Ku was a vicious and evil person.",
        "Possessions": "During a mission, Kueh-Ku acquired a strange black gem that somehow burrowed its way into her flesh, buried in the center of her left palm. This gem absorbed all [[magic]] cast against Kueh-Ku but also made her unable to use magic items. Nobody knew if the gem was a sort of ''[[ioun stone]]'' and would burn out or if it was a permanent power. Initially, she tried to get it removed but soon found it very useful.",
        "Activities": "The higher powers of the Shadow Thieves considered Kueh-Ku to be a key agent in their plots against the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]."
