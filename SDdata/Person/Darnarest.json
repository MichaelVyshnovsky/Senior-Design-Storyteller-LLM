        "mainbody": "'''Darnarest the Bladesmith''' was a competent [[wizard]] and a smith who specialized in creating enchanted weapons. The wizard was slain by the vengeful [[red dragon]] [[Kezzanamark]] in [[1303 DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Darnarest the Bladesmith resided in his tower somewhere in [[interior Faer√ªn]]. His tower was built on the foundation of another wizard's ancient tower constructed ''circa'' [[403 DR]]. That long-gone wizard had a connection to the elven city of [[Myth Drannor]] and created a one-way ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Shrine of Mystra]] there, though the Bladesmith did not know how to activate it.\n\nHe used his magic to alter the sub-levels of the tower, carving additional rooms to suit his needs.\n\nIt was rumored the Bladesmith's works were collected in a book called ''[[Darnarest's Guide to Enchanting Blades]]''.",
        "History": "Darnarest was well known among mercenaries and adventures for his ability to craft magical weapons. This fame eventually was his doom. In the {{YearlinkName|1303}}, an [[Dragon aging|adult]] red dragon named Kezzanamark came searching for the bladesmith who supplied a band of adventurers with weapons after they foolishly attacked the wyrm. The attackers had bragged of the magical weapons crafted by Darnarest and declared that the enchanted arms would be Kezzanamark's doom. Instead, they perished by the dragon's fire. Being a vengeful creature, Kezzanamark investigated the wizard's name. The angry red dragon and the wizard bladesmith engaged in a fierce aerial battle that ended with Darnarest bitten in half. Kezzanamark melted the wizard's tower and scattered its remnants in search of treasure.\n\nDecades later, [[Handragath]] claimed that Darnarest the Bladesmith was his great-uncle and sent groups of adventurers to search for the long-dead relative's ''[[spellbook]]'' ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. In reality, Handragath was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and was tasked with sending unwitting simpletons into the hands of the Cult to be used as slave labor in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]."
