'''Sajifot''' was a [[sorcerer]] member of a marauding [[orc]] tribe that fought against the [[dwarf|dwarven]] King [[Taik]] and sought to conquer his underground kingdom.

==History==
Sajifot's main footnote in history was his death at the hands of King Taik longe before [[1372 DR]]. The orcish sorcerer's essence was used to create an [[enchanted]] weeping for the King, the ''[[Blood Frenzy (axe)|Blood Frenzy]]''. Sajifot's innate bloodthirstiness powered the weapon's magics, and the [[axe]] later was used to behead [[Kumon]], the leader of the horde that sought to destroy King Taik's kingdom.
