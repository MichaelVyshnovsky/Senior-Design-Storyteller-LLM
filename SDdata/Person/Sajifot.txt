Sajifot was a sorcerer member of a marauding orc tribe that fought against the dwarven King Taik and sought to conquer his underground kingdom.
Sajifots main footnote in history was his death at the hands of King Taik longe before 1372 DR. The orcish sorcerers essence was used to create an enchanted weeping for the King, the Blood Frenzy. Sajifots innate bloodthirstiness powered the weapons magics, and the axe later was used to behead Kumon, the leader of the horde that sought to destroy King Taiks kingdom.
