The Xanathar lieutenant Shunn Shurreth wanted to kidnap and ransom a wererat to get the key back.\nRizzeryl liked to remain invisible when dealing with outsiders. As a Zhent ally, he wanted to destroy the Xanathars influence in the Arcane Chambers.\nRizzeryl worked for two masters on the surface, he was an ally of the Zhentarim but secretly he worked for the drow House Auvryndar. He had a quasit familiar and had good dealings with the leader of the Zhent wererats."
