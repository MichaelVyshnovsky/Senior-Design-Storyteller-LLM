        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, the sage [[Beldrune]], working at the [[Moonshorn Tower]], opined about a certain Olbert's ''[[triple-delayed blast fireball]]'' spell. Beldrune noted that Olbert claimed to have created that spell by combining the work of [[Iliymbrim Sharnult]], [[Lhabbartan]], and a third person whose name he could not recall at the moment. This indicated that Olbert was aware of both their works."
