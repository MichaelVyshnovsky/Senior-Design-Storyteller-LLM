        "mainbody": "Xi-Chu was an eastern vampire who ruled over the Taring village of Gigit in Kutuk Valley in Shou Lung in 1358 DR.\nIn 1358 DR, Xi-Chu was attacked in the jungle by some hunters from the village of Tebing, who struck him with a wooden stake and then threw the body into the Ular River. Some time later, Xi-Chu\nwashed ashore and two hunters who found the body removed the stake. Immediately, he drained them of all blood, managing to recover. He planned to regain control of Gigit, which during his absence was ruled by the monk Awang Sophir.\nHe met an adventuring party, hired by the Emperor to find General Goyat Nagumo, and asked for their help in the reconquest of the village, offering safe passage through the area if they agreed and indiscriminately killing them if they refused.\nSomehow, Xi-Chu managed to return to Gigit, where Awang quickly escaped using his ring of teleportation to avoid a confrontation. Xi-Chu thus regained his rule."
