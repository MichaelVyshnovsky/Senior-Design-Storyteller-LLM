Thomd was the innkeep for the Wanton Wyvern inn near Hullack Forest, Cormyr, in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Thomd was a tall, battered-looking man.
He was unkind to Baergasra and insisted that theyd never let a leper inside, because the place was clean.
Thomd was responsible for letting people into the Wanton Wyvern late in the evenings and for barring the gate.
Late in the , Thomd opened the Wanton Wyvern one evening to a group of travelers including Shandril Shessair, Narm Tamaraith, Mirt, and Delg Ironstar. After they were ambushed by local Zhentarim bullyblades, Narm required healing from Baergasra. Though Thomd tried to evict her in the aftermath, she turned out not to be an actual leper, but a Harper in disguise. He drew her a bath.
