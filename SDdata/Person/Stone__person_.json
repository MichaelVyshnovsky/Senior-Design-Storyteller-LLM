        "Relationships": "She did work for [[Hubert Windcastle]], an aide to Lord [[Dagult Neverember]].",
        "History": "Following the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Stone was stationed in the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] of the city. While there she worked with some [[human]] adventurers (directed her way by Hubert) to clear away the barricades built by the violent political faction known as the [[Nashers]] to bar Neverwintan citizens from leaving their homes.\n\nAfter helping the district's evacuation, Stone called for the removal of some Nasher spellcasters who were specifically starting fires within that area of Neverwinter. Finally, she made sure the adventurers recovered some deeds to property that the Nashers stole from [[Lord Neverember]] himself."
