'''Saerlar Stormwyvern''' was a [[Moonstars]] spy inside [[Candlekeep]].

==History==
Saerlar went to infiltrate Candlekeep. He killed and replaced a [[shadovar]] agent who had posed as a monk of the monastery. In [[1487 DR]], after the shadovar special agent [[Maerandor]] gathered all shadovar spies inside Candlekeep, Saerlar infiltrated the group.

However, Maerandor unveiled him, but just before the shadovar could attack him an earthquake hit the room. Saerlar profited off the confusion and managed to escape.
