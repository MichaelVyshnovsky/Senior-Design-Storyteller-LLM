Tordarr was a "bravo" (blademaster) and a member of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in the late 15 century DR.
Tordarr was a young and lithe dragonborn male.
In the , Tordarr was recruited by Bazamarl to join his cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame. He joined because he was tired of the hardships his family had to endure, and because he was addicted to incense. Because of his brief time in the cult, he was not a worshiper of the primordial Achazar. He was also a member of a troupe of bravos.
Two weeks later, a band of adventurers that were sent by Halagothra the Healer to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, killed both Bazalmarl and the Firebird. Tordarr fled in panic, avoiding being killed by the adventurers.
