Gandegar Armstrong was a human adventurer and co-leader of the Emerald Swords company.
Gandegar was a humorless, mean fellow who would do whatever it took to complete his mission. Despite that, he wasnt a particularly cruel man, just extremely ruthless, and could be nice enough when needed.
Gandegar had the simple and practical kit of an enchanted warhammer and enchanted chain mail.
In the , he and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis and act as a dead Lord Thistle instead. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.
