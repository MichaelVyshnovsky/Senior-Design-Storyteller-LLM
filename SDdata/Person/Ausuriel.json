        "mainbody": "'''Ausuriel''', also known as the '''Blind Goat''' or simply '''Clyde''', was a [[deva]] that acted as the patron angel of lost children. She held the role of Herald of [[Shiallia]], the goddess of fertility and [[exarch]] of [[Mielikki]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|22}} She came down to [[Faerûn]] numerous times throughout the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], appearing in the lands of the [[Moonsea]] and the nation of [[Elturgard]].",
        "Description": "Much of the time, Ausuriel took the form of small black [[goat]] with milky eyes.{{Cite adventurers league/Day of the Devil|8}} with dark wings, and [[gnome]]-like features.",
        "Activities": "On the [[Prime Material plane]], Ausuriel dedicated herself to guiding and protecting young children that were touched by the divine. Whether that divinity was benevolent or malign, Shialla's angel dedicated herself to sheltering them, while they carried out their gods' will in the Realms.",
        "Relationships": "{{Quote|Goat sayin' I gotta ta hear the song before I meet da Dark Man. Eyes gon' love it!|Elsiande, speaking of her goat companion.}}\nFor quite some time, Ausuriel took on her goat form and traveled with [[Elisande]], a young girl whom she watched over. According to Elisande, her goat would speak to her, sharing cryptic portents, at least one involving the \"Dark Man\". Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was in fact the [[chosen]] of the imprisoned god [[Cyric]].",
        "History": {
            "Time with Elisande": "{{Quote|That is why I brought these heroes, and the daughter of the Dark Sun.|Ausuriel to Graz'zt, when told she was powerless to stop him.}}\nFor a time during 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Ausuriel lived as a blind goat in a small village on an isle not too far from [[Phlan]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|15}}\n\nElisande and Ausuriel later moved to [[Phlan]], and remained there for a time, until the [[Cult of the Dragon]] took the city in a bloody coup.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|17}} The pair escaped from Phlan, and found a place to stay at [[Fort Iron]] in the [[Underdark]], near [[Mulmaster]].\n\nElisande and Ausuriel traveled across the Moonsea together. They briefly attended a celebration for Mielikki in the village of [[Elventree]] ''circa'' [[1486 DR]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Malady of Elventree|8}} and even traveled back to the Underdark, near the village of [[the Stop]].{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|10}} \n\nLater in [[Sporedome]], the pair joined in on the planning of an assault on the [[drow]] city of [[Maerimydra]].{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|11}} In fact, Elisande joined a group of [[adventurer]]s in their attack on the fortress, all the way to the [[Undying Temple]].{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|46-47}} It was there that the pair helped prevent the Dark Prince [[Graz'zt]] from resisting a magical trap set up by [[Vizeran DeVir]] and [[Gromph Baenre]] that would trap the recently released [[demon lord]]s. It was there in the temple that Graz'zt revealed Ausuriel's true identity, just before Elisande gleefully stabbed the demon lord in the chest.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|46-47}}{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|70}}",
            "Shepherding Dara": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ausuriel once again took the form of a goat, now named '''Clyde''', to join another of the god's chosen, [[Dara]] the young priestess of [[Ilmater]]. Ausuriel and the [[planetar]] [[Rinzel]]―who took the form of an elderly herder named Ghorin―accompanied Dara on her divine quest in the Realms.\n\nAfter the city of [[Elturel]] was pulled down to the [[Nine Hells]], Dara, Ghorin, and Clyde (but mostly Dara) rallied a group of adventurers to save any innocents imperiled by the destruction. They helped the unfortunate Elturgardians join a refugee caravan to safety in the nearby city of [[Baldur's Gate]].{{Cite adventurers league/Escape from Elturgard|3-14}}\n\nOnce in Baldur's Gate, the trio went missing and the refugees they had saved became threatened by [[Gharizol]], a [[barbed devil]] who had been summoned to the city by a [[Cult of Zariel|group of cultists]]. Dara's adventurer friends managed to defeat the devil and save the refugees, some of whom it was revealed were descendants of Elturel's famous cavalry, the [[Hellriders]].{{Cite adventurers league/Day of the Devil|6-8}} Ausuriel and Rinsel then appeared with Dara, and revealed their true identities to the adventures. The angels wanted find heroes brave enough to accompany Dara and her divine quest, to find the lost [[soul]]s of Hellriders that perished during [[Hellriders#History|the Ride]] into the Hells and free them from imprisonment in [[Avernus]]."
