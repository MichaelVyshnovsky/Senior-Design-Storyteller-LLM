'''Xavier''' was a young [[giant eagle]] who nested with his mother, an ancient giant eagle, atop the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Xavier's haughty and protective mother found herself in a feud with a tiny [[blue jay]] who lived atop the monastery. The eagles drove the jay away and claimed his nest, at least according to the blue jay. When she was confronted over the stolen nest, the ancient mother commanded Xavier to stay behind as she was ready to attack anyone who accused her of a crime.
