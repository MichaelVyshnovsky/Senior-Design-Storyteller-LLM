'''Mortlock Vanthampur''' ({{Pronounce|MORT|lock|_|VAN|tham|per|refs=}}) was the youngest son of [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Mortlock was born to [[Thalamra Vanthampur]] and her third husband in the {{YearlinkName|1465}},{{BG-DiA-time}} who on his death asked her to look after Mortlock despite his many problems.

When Mortlock was young, he was scarred across half of his face by a fire.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} he was sent to the dungeon used by the [[Dead Three]] cultists under the bathhouse to assist them in planning attacks. After realizing he was of no use, his half-brothers conspired with several [[Bhaal]] cultists to assassinate him.
