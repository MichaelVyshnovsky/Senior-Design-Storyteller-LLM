        "mainbody": "Melarue Alastrarra was an inhabitant of Myth Drannor in the 3 century DR.\nShe was tall. On the evening in which she encountered Elminster Aumar, she was wearing a nightshift, which like her sisters, made of blue-green silk hanging loosely from a collar.\nShe could conjure fire around her wrists, and likely could cast other spells, too.\nOn the evening when Elminster Aumar arrived at the Alastrarra home, polymorphed into Iymbryl Alastrarra, she found Elminster with her sister, Filaurel Alastrarra, hugging him. He took cover behind Filaurel, so that Melarue wouldnt attack him Naeryndam Alastrarra and Ornthalas Alastrarra arrived soon after. Ornthalas received the kiira from Elminster, and Naeryndam took him to the Coronal for justice."
