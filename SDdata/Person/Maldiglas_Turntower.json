        "mainbody": "'''Maldiglas Turntower''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1318}} to {{yearlink|1322}}. He created a number of refuges.",
        "Appearance": "He was six and a half feet tall, with sharp brown eyes and a firm stride.",
        "Personality": "Maldiglas was polite, and used to be humble and straight about the limits of his powers. Over time, he developed a bit of a superior attitude as he became a more accomplished mage.",
        "Possessions": "He was never seen without a staff half again as tall as himself.",
        "Abilities": "Maldiglas soon found he was susceptible to just about all diseases he encountered.",
        "History": "Originally from [[Sembia]], his family moved to [[Amn]] and then to [[Chessenta]] over trouble with an inheritance. As a youth, he decided to become a mage when a mage named [[Kheldivur]] died in front of him, spellbook in hand; Maldiglas took the book and resolved to become a wizard. From the start, he decided he wanted to be independant from rulers, and to travel broadly, hoping to see as much of [[Faerûn]] as possible. During his travels, he was attacked by [[Qilder Yarven]], whom he defeated, gaining in the process the mantle of the [[Magister]].\n\nAfter a prayer to [[Mystra]] which she answered, he embroiled himself in politics, calling on rulers uninvited, often cowing them into removing oppressive laws that were an obstacle to sorcerous learning, or cajoling them into peace agreements on terms that best suited his ends. He also publicly reproached mages who employed their magic in petty bullyings, and strongly encouraged the plunder of old tombs and older magic throughout Faerûn. His most important project, however, was the creation of a number of ''refuges'', which eventually drained all of his lifeforce.",
        "Rumors": "Maldiglas was said to have been greatly rewarded by Mystra for giving up all of his lifeforce to the task of creating the Refuges. However, his ultimate fate after [[Mystra's Choice]] remained unknown as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
