'''Yekschanivosk''', the Bearer of a Hundred Screaming Skulls was a powerful [[mezzoloth]] of the [[Army of Darkness]] that was instrumental in destruction of [[Serpentspires]] in [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Weeping War]].

==History==
In [[714 DR]], the Army of Darkness breached Myth Drannor's defenses and poured into the war-torn City of Song. Yekschanivosk was among the many creatures that rained destruction on the [[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Cormanthor]] ward where Serpentspires stood. The mezzoloth broke into the famed festhall only to come face to face with a [[half-dragon]] [[enchanter]] [[Onharr the Scalebright]], the owner of the building. They engaged in a spell-slinging battle that destroyed the building's western half. It was believed that both perished in the war.

By [[1369 DR]], many ambitions spellcasters tried to summon Yekschanivosk to no avail. This fact gave confirmation to the stories of the magical [[ruby]] as big as a [[gnome]]'s fist that was made into Yekschanivosk's prison by Onharr. Many talked about the ruby being lost deep in the cellars of ruined Serpentspires calling to adventurers brave enough to shatter the gem in exchange for a boon. The gem was guarded by by long-spoiled numerous caskets of magical [[wine]] that was animated by the wild magics of the War and the ''[[mythal]]'', turning it into hungry corrosive [[ooze]]-like creatures.
