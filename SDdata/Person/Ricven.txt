'''Ricven''' was an [[archmage]] of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He perished during the events of the [[Spellplague]], but his spirit languished on the [[Prime Material plane]] for nearly a century after his death.

==History==
Ricven was a member of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] mage's guild in Neverwinter,<ref group="note">Ricven does not name his mage's guild, but it is likely be the [[Many-Starred Cloak]]. However, he appears in the Fallen Tower, not the Cloak Tower. whose guild tower<ref group="note">The ''Neverwinter'' game states this to be the [[Fallen Tower]], but its depiction of the Fallen Tower is irreconcilable with canon lore and appears to the confused with the [[Cloak Tower]]. Hence the tower is not specified in this article. was torn apart during the Spellplague in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. Ricven and his fellow mages died as they fell into the heart of their collapsing tower.

Thereafter, Ricven and his colleagues existed as "shadows of our former selves", as he put it. For almost a hundred years, Rivcen did not pass on to the [[Fugue Plane]], but remained on [[Toril]] as a [[ghost]] tethered to the spot of his death in a chamber full of bones and dust buried beneath the ruined tower.

Occasionally, people such as one too-curious [[dwarf]] fell into the column of [[blue fire]] at the heart of the tower and found themselves face to face with Ricven in the buried chamber; he usually just answered their questions and sent them back. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a [[wizard]] adventurer jumped, or fell, into the column and met Ricven, who taught them how to cast the pre-Spellplague [[spell]] ''[[ghost sound]]'' and showed locations in the city where enough of the [[Weave]] remained intact to cast. Their colleague [[Lugan]] was impressed and wish to study the cantrip and Weave locations further.

==Abilities==
As a portion of the Weave remained intact at the ruined arcane tower, Rivcen was able to still perform magic as it was before the Spellplague.

==Personality==
Astonishingly, Ricven had not been driven insane, like so many others who remained connected to pre-Spellplague magic. He mostly just seemed bored with waiting to move on.
