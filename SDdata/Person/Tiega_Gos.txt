Zora Tiega Gos () was a noble in Mulmaster of the Gos family.
In 1491 DR, for her birthday, Faltyn commissioned his nephew Andrik Gos to create a painting of her and hired Marim Tem as a musician, and hosted a party at the popular dance hall the Wave and Wink.
Tiega was down to earth and friendly, in total opposition to her husband. She did not care for status. Tiegas interests were art, knowledge, and living life to its fullest, despite these not being typical characteristics of the Gos family.
Tiega was the wife of Faltyn Gos.
