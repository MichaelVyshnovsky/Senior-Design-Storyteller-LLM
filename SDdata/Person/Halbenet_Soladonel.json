        "mainbody": "'''Halbenet Soladonel''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] and adventurer of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "The wise elf had pink skin and orange-brown hair. They mostly wore white-blue clothing and a circlet, most of which were themed around celestial objects.",
        "Personality": "Halbenet was enormously brave, but attributed this to the grace of Corellon rather to themself. They were a beacon of calm even on a chaotic battlefield, and were said to give pause to even their most enraged foes. Aside from helping those in need, Halbenet loved fine clothes, long walks, and a good mystery.\n\nThey memorialized all friends they had ever failed to save from danger, and used those memories to motivate themself to protect others.",
        "Possessions": "Halbenet Soladonel wielded a [[club]], or a [[mace]], accompanied by a [[shield]]. Among magical weapons of theirs were: a ''[[mace of disruption]]'', a ''[[sun blade]]'', a ''[[thunder mace]]'', and ''[[St. Markovia's Thighbone]]'' from the ''[[Domains of Dread]].\n\nThey possessed several other enchanted items, such as their ''[[holy necklace]]'', ''[[ring of long life]]'', ''[[lunar crown]]'', ''[[moon's circlet]]'', ''[[brooch of safety]]'', ''[[talisman of the moon]]'', and ''[[lenses of keen sight]]''.\n\nThey owned the ''[[crown of Corellon]]'', the powerful and legendary magical headwear they decorated with [[gem]]stones, each representing a fallen friend. A pair of magic boots, the ''[[Footsteps of Corellon]]'', along with an opulent ''[[ring of shield other]]'', were gifted to them by [[Laeral Silverhand]], who subsequently also awarded them with the ''[[Caretaker's Crown]]'', the ''[[sword of bright blinding]]'', and the ''[[seal of constancy]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Halbenet regarded as allies their adventuring companions: [[Tommus Tallstep]], [[Naomlen Girdaur]], and [[Shevarith Kendia]].",
        "History": "When Halbenet and their allies set out on their first journey, they found themselves assaulted by an [[orc]] ambush. The party was badly injured, but the novice cleric was able to heal them with a blaze of Corellon's healing light. Most of the party returned home, but the eager cleric set out to continue adventuring and find new friends.\n\nWhen Laeral Silverhand arrived at the [[Yawning Portal]] to find adventurers to clear out [[Sharpstone Keep]], Halbenet was predictably one of the first to volunteer."
