Dengor Bloodheart was a fire giant forgepriest of Surtr in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, after the fire giants occupied the outpost of Szith Morcane, Dengor was chosen as the leader of the place. Soon, he started to build a temple to Surtr over the Fane of Lolth and a great palace for himself. Usually, he prayed at the altar or oversaw the reconstruction.
Dengor was killed by some adventurers.
Dengor was a megalomaniac and power-hungry.
