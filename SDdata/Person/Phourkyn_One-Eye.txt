'''Phourkyn One-Eye''' was a [[sunwyrm]] posing as a [[human]] wizard in [[Thentia]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]]. The wizard [[Firefingers]] believed that there had once been a real Phourkyn One-Eye until the sunwyrm killed him and took his place. He was correct.{{cite book/The Moonsea/Reference Guide|38}}

==History==
As of {{yearlink|1372}},, Phourkyn One-Eye was still a human mage, and part of a cabal of wizards in Thentia. Sometime between then and {{yearlink|1373}}, a sunwyrm replaced him by using magic.

In 1373 DR, the sunwyrm tried to disrupt their research using all means and regularly informed [[Sammaster]] of their progress. After the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]] correctly inferred that the wizards' draconic ally, [[Samdralyrion]], attacked them not just because of the [[Rage of Dragons|Rage]] but because one of their number was a traitor employing the [[aggravate dracorage]] spell, Phourkyn decided to adopt a more active approach to kill the wizards. He summoned a [[chasme]], binding it to him to increase not on his own strength but that of the demon as well, and sent it to kill the other wizards.

When Taegan and the [[faerie dragon]] [[Jivex]] intervened to defend them, Phourkyn initially tried to use the Chasme to lead them to suspect other wizards of being the traitor. When they refused to take the bait, he instead captured them and took control of their minds so that the next time a dragon showed up, Taegan would cast the spell to incite it into a Rage. When the [[elf|elven]] wizard [[Rilitar Shadow-water|Rilitar]] realized something was amiss and removed the enchantment before Taegan could finish the spell, Taegan revealed Phourkyn as the traitor. With his cover blown, Phourkyn assumed his draconic form and attacked them directly. With the help of the other wizards, Taegan and Jivex killed Phourkyn, though the sunwyrm managed to mortally wound Rilitar before he died.
