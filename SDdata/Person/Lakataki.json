However, most of his fellows were enslaved by the efreet Hafiz al-Milhab to work in his mine. \nThus, in 1373 DR, when the azers captured Kaanyr Vhok and his allies, Cripakolus bargained with Kaanyr, offer to release them and show them a passage to the City of Brass in exchange for them destroying the efreet mine. Lakataki heavily supported this agreement."
