        "History": "Lakataki was the seneschal of the azer [[Everash Tribe]] in the Elemental Plane of Fire, acting as an advisor to Lord [[Cripakolus]]. However, most of his fellows were enslaved by the [[efreet]] [[Hafiz al-Milhab]] to work in his mine. \n\nThus, in 1373 DR, when the azers captured [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and his allies, Cripakolus bargained with Kaanyr, offer to release them and show them a passage to the [[City of Brass]] in exchange for them destroying the efreet mine. Lakataki heavily supported this agreement."
