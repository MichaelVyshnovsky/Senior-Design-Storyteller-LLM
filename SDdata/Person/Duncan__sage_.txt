'''Duncan''' was a sage in [[Arabel]] in [[1358 DR]]. His area of expertise was [[goblinoid]]s.

When he was young, Duncan lost his family to a [[goblin]] attack, so he started studying them, becoming the greatest expert in goblin lore. He charged three times than normal for his counsel. As a ranger, he sometimes gathered information personally.
