Duncan was a sage in Arabel in 1358 DR. His area of expertise was goblinoids.
When he was young, Duncan lost his family to a goblin attack, so he started studying them, becoming the greatest expert in goblin lore. He charged three times than normal for his counsel. As a ranger, he sometimes gathered information personally.
