The Coral Princess was a yikarian member of the Seven Sages and governor of the Suns Eye province of the Land of the Yak-Men in 1367 DR.
The Coral Princess was an albino, a rarity among the yak-folk.
The Coral Princess ruled her province from the city of Lipo on the coast of Pearl Bay. Perhaps because of the distance separating her from the heart of the Yikarian Empire, the Coral Princess was rather liberal and accepting compared to her kin. She traded freely with foreigners from the barbarian north, whereas most yak-folk of the "heartlands" would enslave any foreigner on sight.
