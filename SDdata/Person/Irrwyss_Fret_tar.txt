|[[Kelgoth Darksong|Kelgoth]] came here to help the [[Cormanthor Elves]] by searching for the Key to the [[Mythal]]. Now Kelgoth is missing, and these surface dwellers won't life a finger to help find him!<br/>If I hadn't sworn oaths to Eilistraee and Kelgoth to make peace with the surface Elves, I'd give this smug [[Drow dictionary#I|iblith]] a thrashing!

|My friend Kelgoth brought a group of followers of the Lady of the Dance here because he had found information he thought the Cormanthor Elves would find usefulâ€”the location of the Key to the Mythal.<br/>Kelgoth was so excited! He thought the Cormanthor Elves would welcome us with open arms! But instead they ignored us. When they refused to investigate, Kelgoth decided to go into the ruins to find the Key himself.<br/>And when he didn't come back, these [[Drow dictionary#W|waela]] Elves refused to help us go look for him!

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Irrwyss and her friend [[Kelgoth Darksong]] joined the [[Elves of Cormanthor]] in their mission to reclaim [[Myth Drannor]], as Kelgoth believed that he had located the key to the ''[[mythal]]''. While they stayed at the [[Myth Drannor outskirts camp|fortified camp]] outside the city, Kelgoth tried to get assistance from the surfacer [[elves]] for his mission, but wasn't successful. Unwilling to wait, Kelgoth headed into the ruins on his own and vanished, leaving Irrwyss behind. As a loyal friend, Irrwyss was near-frantic with worry and frustration and took it out on the camp's security officer, [[Emalline Brightbough]], who tried to calm her down to little effect.
