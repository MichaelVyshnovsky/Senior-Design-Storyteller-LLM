'''Nadron Ilanis''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Anu]]. He served sheik [[Kassim Arslan]] of the [[Oasis of the White Palm]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|64}}

==Personality==
Nadron was loyal to the sheik. He seldom spoke with outsiders, and had a fanatical hatred of idol worshipers.

==Possessions==
Nadron wore a [[cloak of protection]] and carried a ''[[staff of curing]]''. He also had three scrolls pocketed: one of ''[[neutralize poison]]'', one of ''[[raise dead]]'' and one of ''[[blade barrier]]''.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|64}}

At the clerical tent, Nadron had a statue of solid silver, worth as much as 3000 [[gp]]. The statue had a lock securing it to its altar. In his own personal section  of the tent, Nadron had a chest buried in a shallow hole under his sleeping mat. Inside the chest, Nadron kept a [[cobra|hooded cobra]] as a guardian, and also 1500 [[ep]], 600 [[gp]], and 3 pieces of jewelry worth 400 gp.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|70}}

==Abilities==
While of optimal wisdom for a cleric, the cleric's charisma was his one truly outstanding trait.

==Lore==
Nadron knew that the symbol on the palm of Princess [[Shadalah]] came from a tradition almost as old as the tribe itself. The cleric considered that the mark appearing on the bride's hand was a superstition only important because of tradition, which stated that the mark had great power over evil. He understood its significance, however, realizing that since the symbol had not returned to the altar, the bride should be alive.

Nadron was skeptical of the sheik's belief that the Oasis of the White Palm had been the tribe's ancestral homeland just because of writings inside the old temple in the compound. He also knew that if one planted a date from the white palm tree while praying to Anu, a new palm tree would spring up and grow to full size in only a week.
