        "mainbody": "'''Kathkote Dawntard''' was a nobleman in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He sounded sarcastic even in the best of times.",
        "Personality": "He appeared to have a reputation for rage,{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|217-221|21}} Nonetheless, he was smart, patient and scheming.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|237-240|23}}",
        "Relationships": "He was the son of the elder Dawntard. His usual companions were [[Broryn Windstag]] and [[Delasko Sornstern]]. He was also a co-conspirator with [[Marlin Stormserpent]]'s schemes, though Marlin thought he likely meant trouble.\n\nMarlin's co-conspirators, including Dawntard, included largely families that had been ennobled recently, after the exiling of the [[Bleth]] house and the dispossession of the [[Cormaeril]] family.",
        "Activities": "He frequented [[the Bold Blazon]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|317|33}}",
        "History": "By {{yearlink|1479}}, the young Kathkote had not traveled too far from Suzail in his life. He was a guest at the [[Open Feast]] held at [[Castle Obarskyr]] on [[Mirtul 26]] of that year.\n\nKathkote Dawntard got into a fight at the [[Dragonriders Club]] at some point after the Open Feast, where he'd drawn steel with his toadies and bodyguards, threatening [[Arclath Delcastle]] and slaying [[Delnor]], a palace messenger.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|217-221|21}} They were stopped by the arrival of a number of [[Purple Dragon knight]]s, who threatened they would not instantly take Broryn Windstag, then drunk, at his word.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|225-226|21}} The whole club was questioned thoroughly afterwards.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|230-231|22}} His group fled the tavern as soon as they could, being almost late for their meeting with Marlin.\n\nAfter the meeting with Marlin, Dawntard and his toadies set out on an urgent quest for a largish hand-axe, protecting their identities with nothing but revel masks, half-aware at best that what they were doing was not very strategic.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|326-327|31}} This, alongside the rewards they offered in many taverns, brought them to the notice of Swordcaptain [[Dralkin]] and [[War Wizard]] [[Glathra Barcantle]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|331-332|32}} They only succeeded in their search after [[Manshoon]], an ancient archmage, mind-steered them towards Lord [[Barandror Murandrake]] as part of a plan of his.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|334-335|32}} They were then delivered to [[Stormserpent Towers]] by magic, where, after being ushered by Marlin into a secret passage, Kathkote fainted, leaving Broryn to explain they'd found the axe.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|340|32}}\n\nWord of their doings eventually got to their fellow noble Arclath Delcastle by way of the dancer [[Amarune Whitewave]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|364|34}}"
