Marshal '''Kulwarth''' was a scarred barbarian [[Zhentilar]] officer in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], during the [[Cormanthor War]], Kulwarth was the aide-de-camp of the castellan [[Scyllua Darkhope]]. With Kulwarth's help, Scyllua won a great battle against the [[Red Plumes]].

Later, they were besieging [[Hillsfar]] when Kulwarth informed Scyllua that [[Fzoul Chembryl]] needed to see her.
