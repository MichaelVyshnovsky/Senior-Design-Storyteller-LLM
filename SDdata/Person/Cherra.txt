Sister '''Cherra''' was one of the monks of the [[Monastery of the Precipice]].

==History==
Cherra went from [[Waterdeep]] to the Monastery in [[1473 DR]] in search of answers to the disappearance of her brother. She never met Lady [[Saharel]] and gave up hope. Instead, Cherra found a mission in helping other seekers, joining [[Allendi]].

In [[1479 DR]], she took care of the operation of the monastery's distillery.
