        "mainbody": "'''Meo Cha''' was a noble of the [[Meo]] family of [[Xai Chung]] in [[Koryo]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relations": "Meo Cha was the son of [[Meo Yungdo]] and brother of [[Meo Li]].",
        "Activities": "Meo Cha studied at the [[Do Jang of Won Kwang]], a prestigious military academy in the city of [[Pyong Do]]. There he was educated and trained in the arts of war and the history and lore of Koryo.",
        "History": "Meo Cha's father sent him to the Do Jang of Won Kwang at the age of 6.\n\nAround [[1350 DR]], the [[king of Silla]] ordered Meo Cha (then aged 19) and Meo Li to be kidnapped and sold into slavery. His reason was unknown; it may have been for leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. Meo Cha was visiting the city of [[Tu Pe]] when he was robbed and captured.\n\nFortunately, Meo Cha and Meo Li were reunited and managed to escape. They stowed away on a ship that, rather than being bound for Xai Chung as they'd thought, was in fact part of the king's own secret invasion fleet, now underway for [[Kozakura]]. But a tsunami wrecked the whole armada and the siblings were lost at sea. \n\nSurviving the disaster, the Meo children were washed ashore, alive and well, in distant [[Shou Lung]] at [[Yu Tai Shuni]]. The [[dragon]] [[Mei Lung]] found them and allowed them to live in [[Impossible Palace of the Silver Domes|his house]], where he gladly heard tales of their homeland. He later related their stories to [[Elminster]].\n\nMeo Cha and Meo Li eventually returned safely to Koryo, where the tyrant king had abdicated and their father became advisor to the new king, [[Wanang Sun]]."
