        "mainbody": "'''Belathra Kyndle''' was an innkeeper and a [[priestess]] of [[Sune]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She lived in [[Sleeping Hollow]] on the [[Arnrock]], and was the sole [[human]] on the island.",
        "Activities": "She was the proprietor of the [[Brazen Buck]], both the island's only inn and its only tavern. Her establishment was also the only place where other non-[[halfling]]s could have a drink.\n\nPerhaps cognizant of the fact that she lived on a volcano, Belathra maintained a [[cog]] on the eastern coast of the island that was always fully stocked and ready to sail. If needed, she could fit the island's entire halfling population onto the ship with her."
