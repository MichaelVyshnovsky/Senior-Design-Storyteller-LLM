        "mainbody": "elathra Kyndle was an innkeeper and a priestess of Sune in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She lived in Sleeping Hollow on the Arnrock, and was the sole human on the island.\nShe was the proprietor of the Brazen Buck, both the islands only inn and its only tavern. Her establishment was also the only place where other non-halflings could have a drink.\nPerhaps cognizant of the fact that she lived on a volcano, Belathra maintained a cog on the eastern coast of the island that was always fully stocked and ready to sail. If needed, she could fit the islands entire halfling population onto the ship with her."
