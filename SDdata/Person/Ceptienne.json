        "Description": "The powerful caster was described as beautiful, and had jet-black hair. However, she had a considerable ego, and surrounded herself with [[harpies]] and [[medusa]]e, and rode a [[black dragon]]. As well as being very tactically smart, she was surprisingly skilled in other areas of combat.",
        "Possessions": "She owned an enchanted [[dagger]] and a pair of ''[[bracers of defense]]''.",
        "History": "Long ago, the [[dwarf|dwarven]] settlement of [[Ascore]] called upon the most powerful [[mage]]s of the [[Realms]] to protect the walls of the ancient city from monstrous invasions. Many mages answered the call, but only four prevailed in the huge task. They created a [[magic]]al set of statuettes to protect the ancient city from each cardinal direction, and repelled monsters away from the city.\n\nHowever, as the [[Narrow Sea]] began to ebb and dwindle, the merchants of the city abandoned their stores, and the economy of the area plummeted. During the downfall of the city those aeons ago, the rulers took the magical statuettes, and they were distributed around the Realms. The powerful sorceress, Ceptienne, came into contact with one of the statuettes, and kept watch over it in the Star Mounts.\n{{fq\n|text=I will crush you!
