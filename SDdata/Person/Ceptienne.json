        "mainbody": "eptienne was an intelligent and powerful sorceress that dwelt at the top of the Star Mounts.\nThe powerful caster was described as beautiful, and had jet-black hair. However, she had a considerable ego, and surrounded herself with harpies and medusae, and rode a black dragon. As well as being very tactically smart, she was surprisingly skilled in other areas of combat.\nShe owned an enchanted dagger and a pair of bracers of defense.\nLong ago, the dwarven settlement of Ascore called upon the most powerful mages of the Realms to protect the walls of the ancient city from monstrous invasions. Many mages answered the call, but only four prevailed in the huge task. They created a magical set of statuettes to protect the ancient city from each cardinal direction, and repelled monsters away from the city.\nHowever, as the Narrow Sea began to ebb and dwindle, the merchants of the city abandoned their stores, and the economy of the area plummeted. During the downfall of the city those aeons ago, the rulers took the magical statuettes, and they were distributed around the Realms. The powerful sorceress, Ceptienne, came into contact with one of the statuettes, and kept watch over it in the Star Mounts.\nIn 1358 DR, the Heroes of Ascore-to-be made it their mission to collect all four statuettes, and the ring of reversal, in order to repel monsters back to Ascore. After befriending the aarakocra of the Star Mounts, the avian humanoids flew them to her fortress. On arrival, they were confronted by a ghostly image of Ceptienne. The smart mage knew that the group was there to steal her statuette, so she entrapped them in a maze. However, the adventurers slew her, and took her magical artifact."
