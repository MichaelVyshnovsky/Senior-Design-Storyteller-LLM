        "mainbody": "Molnir the Mighty was a dwarf and part of a valiant group who defended Dead Dwarf Bridge against forces from Narfell who hoped to invade Almorel.\nMolnir fell to his death from the bridge into the Clearflow River far below, but not before killing many enemies.\nThough rarely seen, Molnir haunted Dead Dwarf Bridge as a specter, appearing only at night as a drowned dwarf. He attacked any spellcaster attempting to cross the bridge, but left others alone."
