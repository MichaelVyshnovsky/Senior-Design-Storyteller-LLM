        "mainbody": "Phaudrantanthildrar, or Phaudron for short, was a steel dragon who lived on the continent of Arandron on Toril.\nPhaudrons mate was Malavauvrantarandra (Malavauvra), who was aged and unwell. Malavauvra had laid a number of clutches of eggs in her lifetime, but her last with Phaudron was in poor shape most of the young were sickly and died as hatchlings or within their first year. Only Velsaertirden, Rauvrahrileenatandrar, and Torthalindrarron survived.\nThe family laired within the castle of Steelspires, which had been built for them by stone giants. It stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of Haunvaerune.\nPhaudron was a withdrawn, scholarly type who was focused on his research.\nHe had a keen interest in magic that would extend a dragons life and vitality without limit, and without becoming a dracolich or employing other forms of necromancy. To this end, he constantly developed and experimented with arcane magic and regularly traveled far and wide to discover new magics and obtain rare substances for material components.\nSome time around the 8 century DR, Phaudron went off on another expedition, but could not find the rare component he was after. While he was away, his daughter Rauvrahreene discovered his notes, made copies, and slipped away to her lair to devise a way to reverse her fathers spells. When Phaudron returned weary to Steelspires, she was waitingâ€”Rauvrahreene secretly cast the reversed spells and slew her father. She then murdered her mother in her sleep the same way and seized control of Steelspires, turning it against her brothers."
