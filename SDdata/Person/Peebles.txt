Peebles was a deep gnome servant of the beholder Xazax in the late 15 century DR.
Peebles said he had long been interested in aberrations, and especially in beholders.
Peebles was the personal surgeon and attendant of Xazax the Eyemonger, a beholder who attacked other beholders for their eyestalks. Peebles would graft these eyestalks onto Xazaxs own body.
Xazax sent Peebles to Mantol-Derith circa 1486 DR to search for more beholders from which to take new eyestalks. He had checked the duergar and deep gnome sections of the city, but had not yet searched the drow section and the Zhentarim garrison.
