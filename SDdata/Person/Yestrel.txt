'''Yestrel''' was an assumed [[Sembian]] or [[Westgate]] conspirer against [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, upon his coming death, [[Osbur]] claimed to have orders from [[Olgarth Oldbridle]] in case of his death, calling on him to deliver a message for his heir, [[Elbert Oldbridle]]. In turn, the latter sent Osbur to lord [[Traevyn Illance]] to repeat the message, warning him to mind the perfidy of cabals from [[Sembian]] or [[Westgate]], naming specifically [[Kormoroth]], Yestrel, and the [[Lhendreth]]s of [[Saerloon]].
