'''Florbb''' was the [[mud mephit]] who "ruled over" the [[Mud Pits of Florrb]] on the [[Snout of Omgar]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Due to the circumstances in which he found himself, Florbb was extremely anxious.

==Activities==
Florbb spent much of his time attracting and encouraging [[tortle]]s to bathe in muddy pits, hoping they would trigger some magical effect.

==History==
Centuries before the [[Second Sundering]], Florbb and two other mud mephits were transported from their home in the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] to the Mud Pits on [[Toril]]. While Florbb's companions were able to return home by playing in the mud of their new surroundings, Florbb was not so lucky. He spent decades upon decades trying to return to his friends.
