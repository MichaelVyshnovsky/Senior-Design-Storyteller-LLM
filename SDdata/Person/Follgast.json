        "mainbody": "'''Follgast''' was an [[elf|elven]] agent of the [[Zhentarim]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Pity it had to come to this. My dad knew this place, back before Keene took over.''|Follgast}}",
        "Description": "Follgast was a tall and strong-looking elven man with dark skin tone and short curly golden hair. He wore ornate [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[longbow]].",
        "History": "Follgast's father was a shady individual who was either a member of the infamous [[Guild]] or was associated with the guildhall before the leadership was taken over by [[Nine-Fingers Keene]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Follgast worked under ranking Zhents [[Roah Moonglow]] and [[Friol]], forging sticky alliances with the Guild and the [[Cult of the Absolute]] alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the [[Stone Lord]], so Nine-Fingers rolled [[dice]] and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Follgast was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's [[Undercellar]]. Nine-Fingers, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Follgast's fate remained unconfirmed."
