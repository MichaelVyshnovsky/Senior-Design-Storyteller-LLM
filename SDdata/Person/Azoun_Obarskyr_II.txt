==Relatives==
Azoun was the only child of King [[Arangor Obarskyr]].

==Background==
Azoun fought against the [[red dragon]] attack on [[Suzail]] in [[1018 DR]], at a time when he was prince to his father, King [[Arangor Obarskyr]]. He was courting a young lady who was rescued from the burning [[Castle Obarskyr]] by [[Jorunhast]], which displeased him greatly. Azoun had to help Jorunhast, who had panicked, during their battle with [[Thauglor]], but Jorunhast tried to prevent him from entering the battle. Azoun attacked Thauglor with [[Orbyn]] and killing him by driving the blade into the dragon's brain. The two men had heightened mutual respect thereafter.

==Possessions==
Azoun possessed the magical sword [[Orbyn]].
