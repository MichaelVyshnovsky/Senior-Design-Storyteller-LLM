Azoun Obarskyr II was the king of Cormyr. He was thin and lean in appearance.
Azoun was the only child of King Arangor Obarskyr.
Azoun fought against the red dragon attack on Suzail in 1018 DR, at a time when he was prince to his father, King Arangor Obarskyr. He was courting a young lady who was rescued from the burning Castle Obarskyr by Jorunhast, which displeased him greatly. Azoun had to help Jorunhast, who had panicked, during their battle with Thauglor, but Jorunhast tried to prevent him from entering the battle. Azoun attacked Thauglor with Orbyn and killing him by driving the blade into the dragons brain. The two men had heightened mutual respect thereafter.
