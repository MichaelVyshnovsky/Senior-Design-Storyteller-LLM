        "mainbody": "Shanzezim was a marid clockmaker who inhabited the abandoned Waterclock Guilds Crypts in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nPrior to the Waterclock Guilds destruction, Shanzezim, alongside several other water elementals, were conjured and bound to the guilds crypts. When the members of the guild abandoned the premises, all of the bound creatures and several of the guilds clockwork mechanisms were left behind.\nShanzezim was certain of the guilds destruction, but he was reluctant to test the strength of the magical binding to make an escape. He spent almost all his time in this sort of captivity trying to re-build one of the Waterclock Guilds most complex clocks. By the late 1490s DR, he believed that finishing assembling the clock shouldnt take him more than a few years."
