Shamus Dolphinsbane was the dockmaster of Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He thoroughly questioned anyone entering the docks to a degree where it was annoying. Many of these questions even had nothing to do with what the Zhentish authorities actually wanted to know regarding the cargo of approaching vessels. He often got distracted during such questioning, sharing tales of the sea with his unfortunate audience.
Shamus enjoyed drinking at the Tesh-Wave on his down time.
Shamus was a sea captain before he decided to retire.
