        "mainbody": "'''Havilar''' was a [[tiefling]] [[fighter]] and bounty hunter of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the twin sister of [[Farideh]].",
        "History": "She grew up in the small village of [[Arush Vayem]] on the frontier of [[Tymanther]]. As infants, Havilar and her twin sister Farideh were left in a basket at the village gate and were adopted by a clanless [[dragonborn]] warrior named [[Mehen]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Havilar was in a barn attempting to summon an [[imp]] when she accidentally summoned a [[cambion]] from [[Malbolge]] named [[Lorcan]]. Her twin Farideh was tricked by Lorcan into entering into a [[warlock]] pact.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|344}} When Lorcan returned to his home plane, he caused an explosion which leveled the barn and resulted in Havilar, Farideh, and Mehen's expulsion from the village.\n\nAfter Havi and her family were kicked out of Arush Vayem, they began working as bounty hunters. While pursuing a bounty on a [[Torm|Tormite]] priestess on the [[Sword Coast]], they aided a caravan under attack by [[orc]]s and befriended a young runaway Tormite acolyte named [[Aubrin Crownsilver|Brin]] who was traveling with the caravan to [[Neverwinter]]. Brin was the target of Havi's bounty, who was attempting to return him to [[Cormyr]]. Brin convinced the trio that they should travel to Neverwinter and wait for the priestess to show up at the Tormite temple.\n\nWhile in Neverwinter, Havilar and her twin became mixed up in a plot conceived by the [[archdevil]] [[Glasya]] to gain control of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. Havilar was dominated by a [[succubus]] named [[Rohini]] and sent to slaughter a cell of [[Ashmadai]] cultists. With the help of Lorcan, Havilar and Farideh were able to cause enough trouble that Glasya abandoned her plan.\n\nLater, in the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, Mehen, Farideh, and Havilar returned their bounty [[Constancia]] to [[Suzail]] through the Waterdeep ''[[portal]]''. Due to lack of funds, only Mehen and Constancia were able to make the journey through the portal while Farideh and Havilar remained behind in Waterdeep.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|688}} With nothing better to do, Havilar and Farideh tagged along with [[Tam Zawad]] who was investigating magical page from an ancient [[Netheril|Netherese]] book. Farideh was invited to a party at the mansion of the caravan master who purchased the page and she and Tam's [[Harper]] partner stole the page.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|2536}} \n\nTam's daughter [[Mira Zawad|Mira]] was able to locate the origin of the page, the lost [[Library of Tarchamus]], and Farideh, Havilar, Tam, Mira, and friends journeyed to the library where they destroyed [[Tarchamus the Unyielding]]'s [[mummy]] and removed the magical tome from which the page was ripped. In the process, the library was destroyed.",
