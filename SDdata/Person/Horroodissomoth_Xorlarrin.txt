Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin was the house wizard and patron (with Matron Mother Zeerith QXorlarrin) of House Xorlarrin around 1372 DR.
He appeared very old, but that was rumored to be due to a magical experiment gone wrong.
Horroodissomoth was the leader of a council of mages that governed the magical academy of Sorcere in 1370 DR. He was second only to the Archmage of Menzoberranzan, Gromph Baenre.
Horroodissomoth was later driven insane by the Spellplague. He was killed by his own 
delayed blast fireball, which he had placed in his vest pocket.
