        "mainbody": "Essam was an elf from Al Qahera in Raurin as of . When Kiril Duskmourn sought to take refuge from a dust storm of the Raurin in Al Qahara, it was Essam that was at the door and let her in at the moment, he was wearing a white gown, and a larger, rune-covered cloth over it. Though his features were elven, he was sun-weathered.\nHe became interested in Kirils tale as soon as she mentioned that she sought a source of evil north of their settlement, and told her of their own experiences with the Storm Spike, as theyd dubbed the Palace of the Purple Emperor. When Kiril was about to leave, he bequeathed Sandrul unto her, hoping she could avenge Feraih with it."
