'''Joppa''' was a [[human]] [[fisher]]man and [[monk]] who was active as an [[adventurer]] in and around [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was fond of telling fishing stories, except about fish that got away. His tales featured everything from [[quipper]]s and [[eel]]s to [[shark]]s and [[squid]] to a [[kraken]], which was one of those "unfinished" tales he preferred not to share.

==Possessions==
[[File:Lucas-bischoff-joppa-weapons.jpg|thumb|388x388px|''Collections of Joppa's [[fishing rod]]s and [[harpoon]]s.'']]
Joppa's attire was humble and reflected his dual life as a fisherman and a monk. In battle, he was known to wield fishing implements, notably [[harpoon]]s and even [[fishing rod]]s. He handmade many of these fishing implements himself, and was also known to craft and wear beaded prayer necklaces out of [[shell]]s, [[pearl]]s, and pieces of defeated sea monsters.

He also possessed several [[magic items]], including a ''[[ring of free action]]'' which he had recovered from the wreck of a ship from [[Nimbral]]. He also had an ''[[obsidian steed]]'', an ''[[Ioun stone of absorbtion]]'', and a ''[[Daern's instant fortress]]''. During his career adventuring in Waterdeep, he was personally awarded the ''[[harpoon of sudden stillness]]'' and the ''[[seal of tranquility]]'' by [[Laeral Silverhand]].

==Abilities==
Joppa was trained in the use of ''[[ki]]''. He was known to be able to neutralize enemies with ease in even the roughest of fights. He could glide into battle unheard and unseen, or he could command the attention of an entire battlefield with his mere presence.

==History==
Joppa received his training at a monastery near [[Saltmarsh]], At some point, he traveled to [[Toril]] and lost his sense of adventure, instead working on fishing ships and mastering the use of the fishing rod. One day while on the [[Sea of Swords]], he was attacked by a kraken and barely escaped. The experience taught him that his skills in fishing were as mighty as his skills in martial arts, and this discovery renewed his sense of adventure.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Joppa was working as an adventurer, and served [[Open Lord]] Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep to help keep her city and its environs safe.
