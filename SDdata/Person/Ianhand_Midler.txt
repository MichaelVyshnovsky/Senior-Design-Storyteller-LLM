Ianhand Midler was an elder member of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.
Ianhand was an older man with a bald head and neat white goatee.
Ianhand was the father of Ricnan and Quilynn, and husband of Neris.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the cook Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.
Ianhand and his wife Neris were bound up in one of the upstairs bedrooms, guarded by drow warriors until their fate was determined.
