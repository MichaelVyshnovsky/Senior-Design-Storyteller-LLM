==Description==
Ianhand was an older man with a bald head and neat white goatee.

==Relationships==
Ianhand was the father of [[Ricnan Midler|Ricnan]] and [[Quilynn Midler|Quilynn]], and husband of [[Neris Midler|Neris]].

==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the cook [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.

Ianhand and his wife Neris were bound up in one of the upstairs bedrooms, guarded by drow warriors until their fate was determined.
