Bollus was a caravaneer in the service of the Rundeen in 1370 DR.
Bollus was a caravaneer who originated from Calimport and owned a caravan business in Westgate, who traveled up and down between the two cities. He was, however, so influenced by Westgates customs that he stopped using his family and house names. His nickname, Copperteeth, derived from the particular predilection of Bollus for this metal, which he used in all forms and particularly to substitute four of his teeth. Some said, in contrast, that his nickname derived from his ability to convince traders to give him all their precious metal.
