Sherif Akyar al-Awasif was a noble djinni and a member of the royal court khedive Samia al-Said of Rogosto in East Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Unique among noble genies, Akyar served the Khedive of Rogosto by choice. Samia al-Said once freed Akyar from imprisonment, forever earning her gratitude and voluntary service. This was quite the reward for Samia, considering that Akyar was too powerful for even accomplished shairs to bind.
Akyar acted as the representative of the genies in Rogostos court. She also served as the Sherif of the city and commanded over two hundred jann as well as four hundered ins guards that operated in Samias palace. However, Akyar spent much of her time playing match-maker between some of the younger members of the court.
Akyar was inseparable from Samia.
