'''Sherif Akyar al-Awasif''' was a [[noble djinni]] and a member of the royal court khedive [[Samia al-Sa'id]] of [[Rog'osto]] in [[Zakhara|East Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Unique among noble [[genie]]s, Akyar served the Khedive of Rog'osto by choice. [[Samia al-Sa'id]] once freed Akyar from imprisonment, forever earning her gratitude and voluntary service. This was quite the reward for Samia, considering that Akyar was too powerful for even accomplished [[sha'ir]]s to bind.

Akyar acted as the representative of the [[genie]]s in Rog'osto's court. She also served as the Sherif of the city and commanded over two hundred [[jann]] as well as four hundered ''[[ins]]'' guards that operated in Samia's palace. However, Akyar spent much of her time playing match-maker between some of the younger members of the court.

==Relationships==
Akyar was inseparable from Samia.
