==Description==
Phyria was a [[human]] woman with dark skin, brown eyes, and curly black hair. She wore simple blue dresses.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ [[Lord Gortash]]. Phyria  eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.'' [[Augur Harxkellan]] was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers in the Lower City with Phyria Gollus among them. As a fellow loyalist, Phyria approved of Gortash and his [[steel watcher]]s.
