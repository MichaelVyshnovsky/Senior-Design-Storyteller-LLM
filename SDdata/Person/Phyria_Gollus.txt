Phyria Gollus was a commoner from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in late 15 century DR.
Phyria was a human woman with dark skin, brown eyes, and curly black hair. She wore simple blue dresses.
In the , the city of Baldurs Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ Lord Gortash. Phyria  eagerly consumed the new lords propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the Baldurs Mouth Gazette. Augur Harxkellan was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers in the Lower City with Phyria Gollus among them. As a fellow loyalist, Phyria approved of Gortash and his steel watchers.
