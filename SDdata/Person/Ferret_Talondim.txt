Ferret Talondim was a thief in the city of Iriaebor during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a small and wiry man, with beady dark eyes, a thin nose, dark stubble, and a raspy voice.
He wore a brown tunic and carried an assortment of knives he was expertly precise when throwing them.
He was a keen thief and even talked about murder nonchalantly he would do it if things werent going his way.
He was part of the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon. Ferrets grandmother, Jewel Talondim, was matriarch of the Talondim Clan.
He joined the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon after the wizard Morhion Gendahar.
He was thought to have died in 1363 DR by sacrificing himself to save the rest of the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon when they were escaping the crypt of the Shadowking.
After Ferret sacrificed himself so that the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon could escape the crypt of the Shadowking, Ferret gathered all the treasure he could find as the crypt collapsed and found the Shadowstar. The Shadowstar asked him if he wanted to escape, and of course he said yes.
The Shadowstar teleported him to a hill north of Soubar. The Shadowstar granted great luck to Ferret the master thief of Soubar died mysteriously when Ferret first arrived. Ferret started a crime organization in Soubar. Everyone thought Ferret was dead, so he took up the opportunity to start anew under the alias of Stiletto.
After the renewed Fellowship of The Dreaming Dragon found Ferret in Soubar, he left Cormik and his grandmother Jewel Talondim in charge of the crime organization in Soubar, and they ran the business together. At around Midwinter, 1365 DR, Ferret moved his base of operations to Iriaebor.
