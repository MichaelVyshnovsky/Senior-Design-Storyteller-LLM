'''Ferret Talondim''' was a thief in the city of [[Iriaebor]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a small and wiry man, with beady dark eyes, a thin nose, dark stubble, and a raspy voice.<ref>

He wore a brown tunic and carried an assortment of knives; he was expertly precise when throwing them.<ref>

==Personality==
He was a keen thief and even talked about murder nonchalantly; he would do it if things weren't going his way.<ref>

==Relationships==
He was part of the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]]. Ferret's grandmother, [[Jewel Talondim]], was matriarch of the [[Talondim Clan]].<ref>

==History==
He joined the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon after the wizard [[Morhion Gen'dahar]].

He was thought to have died in [[1363 DR]] by sacrificing himself to save the rest of the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon when they were escaping the crypt of the [[Shadowking]].<ref>

After Ferret sacrificed himself so that the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon could escape the crypt of the Shadowking, Ferret gathered all the treasure he could find as the crypt collapsed and found the ''[[Shadowstar]]''. The ''Shadowstar'' asked him if he wanted to escape, and of course he said yes.

The ''Shadowstar'' teleported him to a hill north of [[Soubar]]. The ''Shadowstar'' granted great luck to Ferret; the master thief of Soubar died mysteriously when Ferret first arrived. Ferret started a crime organization in Soubar. Everyone thought Ferret was dead, so he took up the opportunity to start anew under the alias of '''Stiletto'''.

After the renewed Fellowship of The Dreaming Dragon found Ferret in Soubar, he left [[Cormik]] and his grandmother Jewel Talondim in charge of the crime organization in Soubar, and they ran the business together.<ref> At around [[Midwinter]], [[1365 DR]], Ferret moved his base of operations to Iriaebor.<ref>
