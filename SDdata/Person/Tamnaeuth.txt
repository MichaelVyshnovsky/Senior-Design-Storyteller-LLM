'''Tamnaeuth''' was a very old [[elf]] armorer who lived in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

He created high-quality [[sword]]s, [[mail]], and [[plate armor]]. Most of his pieces were enchanted and often became legendary both on Evermeet and in the world at large. He didn't charge a fee for his creations, instead offering them to people he chose, trusting that if elves with influence accepted his works it would bolster his reputation. In exchange for this, the recipients of his items provided him with food, clothing, and other things he needed.
