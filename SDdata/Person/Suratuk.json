        "mainbody": "Suratuk was an eccentric artisan from Calimport in the late 15 century DR. Despite his relative fame, he was rarely seen in person.\nSuratuk was considered to be eccentric, and despite frequent injuries, he continued being dedicated to his craft.\nSometime in the late-15 century DR, Suratuk decided to take up the hobby of hand-painting and decorating unique, as well as dangerous, animals. Many of them being mounts. He eventually was awarded the title of \"Visionary\" for his efforts to paint a giant spider teal, whose bites required him to seek a healer.\nAfter the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge helped him with his efforts in Omu, the tiefling Makos had Suratuk specially paint them a set of giant striders in vibrant ruby colors.\nGiant Red Crab During what some deemed to be his \"classical period,\" Suratuk typically painted giant crabs in a simple deep red coloration that was rather natural looking. \nGiant Sunset Crab Once, while observing wild giant crabs, Suratuk was overcome with emotions as he gazed upon the vibrant orange hues the sun took as it set over the waves. Following that incident he no longer painted crabs red, only vibrant orange. \nBanded Spider A giant spider painted by Suratuk in one of his more eclectic styles, featuring red and yellow bands for accent and variety of angles.\nBlue Strider A giant strider that Suratuk was especially careful with while painting and tinting a design on to its neck and flanks, as that particular strider put him at risk of losing his fingers.\nBlue Tarantula Once, after adventuring in a jungle, Suratuk returned home and proclaimed that \"blue is the perfect camouflage for the jungle!\" He then proceeded to paint a number of tarantulas blue, receiving many bite marks up his hands in the process.\nJungle Spider A giant Chultan spider that Suratuk was rumored to have described with a smile as being painted in the \"colors of his nightmares.\"\nOrange Tarantula A set of tarantulas that were painted in a rather restrained combination of orange and black. Suratuk would claim that they were originally magenta and gold when he painted them, though no one was certain if he was joking or not.\nRed-Dusted Axebeak An axebeak whose feathers were gently painted by Suratuk by dusting them with vibrant colored powders.\nTeal Crag Cat A crag cat that Suratuk became infatuated with while painting. During this process he spoke to the beast, \"You are soft and kind like a stuffed animal, so Ill paint you like one.\"\nYeth Hound At some point Suratuk painted a yeth hounds body to resemble the fur coat of a leopard."
