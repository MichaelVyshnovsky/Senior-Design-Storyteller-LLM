        "History": "Sometime in the late-15{{th}} century DR, Suratuk decided to take up the hobby of hand-painting and decorating unique, as well as dangerous, animals. Many of them being [[mount]]s. He eventually was awarded the title of \"Visionary\" for his efforts to paint a [[giant spider]] teal, whose bites required him to seek a healer.\n\nAfter the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] helped him with his efforts in [[Omu]], the [[tiefling]] [[Makos]] had Suratuk specially paint them a set of [[giant strider]]s in vibrant ruby colors.",
        "Activities": {
            "Notable Works": {
                "Giant Red Crab": "During what some deemed to be his \"classical period,\" Suratuk typically painted [[giant crab]]s in a simple deep red coloration that was rather natural looking.",
                "Giant Sunset Crab": "Once, while observing wild giant crabs, Suratuk was overcome with emotions as he gazed upon the vibrant orange hues [[the sun]] took as it set over the waves. Following that incident he no longer painted crabs red, only vibrant orange.",
                "Banded Spider": "A giant spider painted by Suratuk in one of his more eclectic styles, featuring red and yellow bands for accent and variety of angles.",
                "Blue Strider": "A giant strider that Suratuk was especially careful with while painting and tinting a design on to its neck and flanks, as that particular strider put him at risk of losing his fingers.",
                "Blue Tarantula": "Once, after adventuring in a jungle, Suratuk returned home and proclaimed that \"blue is the perfect camouflage for the jungle!\" He then proceeded to paint a number of [[tarantula]]s blue, receiving many bite marks up his hands in the process.",
                "Jungle Spider": "A giant Chultan spider that Suratuk was rumored to have described with a smile as being painted in the \"colors of his nightmares.\"",
                "Orange Tarantula": "A set of tarantulas that were painted in a rather restrained combination of orange and black. Suratuk would claim that they were originally magenta and gold when he painted them, though no one was certain if he was joking or not.",
                "Red-Dusted Axebeak": "An [[axebeak]] whose feathers were gently painted by Suratuk by dusting them with vibrant colored powders.",
                "Teal Crag Cat": "A [[crag cat]] that Suratuk became infatuated with while painting. During this process he spoke to the beast, \"You are soft and kind like a stuffed animal, so I'll paint you like one.\"",
                "Yeth Hound": "At some point Suratuk painted a [[yeth hound]]'s body to resemble the fur coat of a [[leopard]]."
