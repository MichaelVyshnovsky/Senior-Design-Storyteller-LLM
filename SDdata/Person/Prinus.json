        "mainbody": "Prinus was a wood woad that laired in Uthe Lodge during the late 15 century DR.\nPrinus lurked in Uthe Lodge along with the other wood woads Robur and Falcata around the same time as the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar. They served and protected the maddened dryad Sylvie, who was the source of the plant overgrowth. The wood woads, the dryad, and other plant and animal life in the Lodge had been twisted by the druid Halsaime, who had infected the ranger Peron Uthe and allowed him to spread the disease."
