'''Gandalug Battlehammer''' was a [[dwarf]] of [[Clan Battlehammer]] and the first and ninth king of [[Mithral Hall]]. He was imprisoned by [[Yvonnel Baenre]] before he was freed after Yvonnel's death in the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]].

==History==
Gandalug was the king of Clan Battlehammer at the time when Bruenor led a thousand dwarves of the clan to Mithral Hall and commenced work on building the Undercity.

As he grew old, he found his closest friend in the [[battlerager]] [[Crommower Pwent]], an ancestor of [[Thibbledorf Pwent]], who later became a close friend of the later [[Bruenor Battlehammer|King Bruenor Battlehammer]]. Gandalug eventually gave the kingdom to his son and, with the aid of his companion Crommower, descended into the [[Underdark]] for a final journey and adventure. They encountered [[drow]] elves, led by Yvonnel Baenre, and there they engaged the drow. Crommower was killed by a lance while he was slaying a drow [[wizard]], and Gandalug's soul was stolen by Baenre and sealed within his own tooth.

Baenre tormented him for thousands of years, until the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] when Baenre threw Gandalug's tooth in a fit of rage, freeing his soul. He attempted to kill Baenre with her son [[Berg'inyon Baenre]]'s own sword, but was foiled by an [[illithid]] [[El-Viddenvelp|ally]]. During the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]] and the ferocious fighting in the tunnels, he was freed by his descendant Bruenor Battlehammer, the rogue drow [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], Bruenor's adopted daughter [[Catti-brie]], and the halfling [[Regis]].

Gandalug died not long after his ascension to the throne. With his death, Thibbledorf Pwent and the famed [[Gutbuster Brigade]] sought out Bruenor Battlehammer to inform him that he, the eighth King of Mithral Hall, was now the tenth King of Mithral Hall.

==Relationships==
Gandalug had three sons; the youngest, [[Bruenor Battlehammer I]], became the second King of Mithral Hall. He chose him as he was the most fitting. The more well-known Bruenor Battlehammer was Gandalug's great-great-great-great grandson.
