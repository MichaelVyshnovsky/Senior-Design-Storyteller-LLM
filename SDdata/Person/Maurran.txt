Kithguard Maurran was a shadar-kai rogue of the midâ€“14th century DR.
Serving Kithlord Thieraven, he commanded a group of shadar-kai defenders at the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR. He was likely slain when adventurers in service to Mystra assaulted the fort.
Equipped similarly to all his people, Maurran wielded a well-made spiked chain and composite shortbow and wore +2 studded leather and a +2 gal-ralan.
