'''Aradin the Elder''', father of [[Aradin Beno]], was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] who died some years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Aradin the Elder died sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1486}} and was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]], next to the [[Grand Mausoleum]]. His gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Aradin the Elder - Open the Bloody Gates." His grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.
