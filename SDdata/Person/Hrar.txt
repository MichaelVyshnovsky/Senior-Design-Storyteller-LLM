Hrar was a bugbear chieftain.
In 1491 DR, he was approached by cultists of the Cult of the Howling Hatred who offered their help in subjugating the area in exchange for his stopping all visitors to the nearby Monastery of the Yellow Rose. He agreed, and soon he had conquered first the pacifist Shadow Talon goblin tribe and then the village of Tomrav, capturing many hostages. Eventually, an adventuring party hired for a mission at the monastery were convinced by sergeant Sergor to fight Hrar and his minions, and the chieftain was killed.
