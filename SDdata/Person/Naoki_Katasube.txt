'''Naoki Katasube''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Niwa clan]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
In [[Bingo]] village in a Niwa [[Kozakuran dictionary#S|''shoen'']], he controlled affairs from a beautiful house served by twenty servants. Naoki led one samurai and thirty [[bushi]]. Secretly, he used his position as ship inspector to steal goods to pay his debts.

==Personality==
Naoki was indolent, always preferring to live in luxury than risk his life.

==Activities==
Compounding his disregard for duty, Katasube has accumulated substantial debts with moneylenders and the [[yakuza]] in [[Okahira]], risking his status and comfort. To conceal his financial mismanagement and avoid disgrace, he has resorted to falsifying the accounts of all goods processed through the Niwa [[Kozakuran dictionary#G|''godowns'']] in Bingo, a responsibility that fell squarely on his shoulders. Despite pilfering from the collected rents and taxes, his financial situation continued to deteriorate, plunging him further into debt. 

He commanded a contingent of one [[samurai]] and thirty [[bushi]]. Katasube has kept them in the dark about his illicit endeavors, maintaining a facade of legitimacy while engaging in corruption behind the scenes.
