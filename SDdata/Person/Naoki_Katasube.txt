Naoki Katasube was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In Bingo village in a Niwa shoen, he controlled affairs from a beautiful house served by twenty servants. Naoki led one samurai and thirty bushi. Secretly, he used his position as ship inspector to steal goods to pay his debts.
Naoki was indolent, always preferring to live in luxury than risk his life.
Compounding his disregard for duty, Katasube has accumulated substantial debts with moneylenders and the yakuza in Okahira, risking his status and comfort. To conceal his financial mismanagement and avoid disgrace, he has resorted to falsifying the accounts of all goods processed through the Niwa godowns in Bingo, a responsibility that fell squarely on his shoulders. Despite pilfering from the collected rents and taxes, his financial situation continued to deteriorate, plunging him further into debt. 
He commanded a contingent of one samurai and thirty bushi. Katasube has kept them in the dark about his illicit endeavors, maintaining a facade of legitimacy while engaging in corruption behind the scenes.
