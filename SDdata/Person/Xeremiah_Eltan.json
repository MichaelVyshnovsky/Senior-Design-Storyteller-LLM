        "mainbody": "'''Grand Duke Eltan''' ({{Pronounce|EL|tan|refs= During the [[iron crisis]] of [[1368 DR]], Eltan was nearly assassinated by members of the [[Iron Throne]], but he survived the attempt.",
        "Description": "Eltan was a handsome, tall man with black hair and grey eyes. He was usually clad for combat, wearing a full suit of polished [[plate mail]] and carrying multiple magical items and weapons. He was extremely wealthy, as a result of leading the wildly successful Flaming Fist company.",
        "Personality": "A steadfast and principled man, Eltan was respected by many [[Faerûn]]ian rulers, both for his tactical genius and because he was familiar with the plight of ruling a realm. Eltan had a sincere belief in maintaining the balance of power among the many small kingdoms of Faerûn, and as such actively sought to hire out his Flaming Fist to prevent the formation of empires. Although he had a love of fighting, Eltan strove to keep emotions separated from business.",
        "Possessions": "Duke Eltan owned an enchanted suit of plate mail and a ''[[displacer cloak]]''. He wore a ''[[girdle of frost giant strength]]'' and ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'', greatly increasing his strength. He disdained the use of a [[shield]], and preferred to bring a ''[[Hammer of Thunderbolts|hammer of thunderbolts]]'' into combat, although he rarely used it. Other weapons in his arsenal included a ''[[frostbrand]]'' [[longsword]], a magical silver longsword, a magical silver dagger, as well as a telepathic [[short sword]] named ''[[Roan]]'', which he was greatly attached to. Eltan wore a ''[[ring of absorption]]'', a ''[[ring of anti-venom]]'', a ''[[greenstone amulet]]'', as well as a magical bracelet that allowed him to telepathically communicate with his senior officers.\n\nEltan's personal fortune numbered 160,000 [[currency|gp]], contained in a sealed vault in the [[Nether Mountains]], accessible by his friend [[Moruene]] through a scroll of ''[[teleport]]''.",
        "Activities": "Eltan was often the subject of assassination attempts, since it was commonly believed that the Flaming Fist would crumble without his leadership.",
        "Relationships": "Eltan kept the counsel of two good friends. The massive fighter [[Hurbold Duethkatha|Scar]] was Eltan's right-hand man in the Flaming Fist. The two were close, having known each other since their youth, and Eltan was one of only two people who knew Scar's true name. Moruene, a powerful [[wizard|magic user]], was a lifelong friend of Eltan, and his occasional lover.\n\nIn combat, Eltan, together with Moruene, would often be protected by the seven senior officers of the Flaming Fist. These visored, plate-clad warriors would form a hedgehog formation around Eltan, willing to give their lives for their leader.",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "By the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Eltan was long dead, but still remembered. [[Eltan (family)|His descendants]] became a [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|patriar family]] in Baldur's Gate, though they sold their stake in the Flaming Fist company to cover debt. Eltan's armor and sword were on display among other trophies and relics in the [[Seatower of Balduran]]."
