        "mainbody": "urlin was the last brewmaster of Myth Drannor who perished during the Weeping War and whose ghostly apparition could be seen and heard haunting the places he loved in life.\nDurlin left behind a few items that belonged to him, he hid his pair of gloves of courage in a barrel in the room he used to play chess at, and his favorite weapon, the brewmasters cudgel was used by one of the lizardfolk that found in the Dungeons ruins.\nAs the brewmaster, Durlin was maintaining the Shrine of Hanseath in the Halls of Light and was in charge of the citys sacred brewery. His tireless work could still be witnessed all across many levels of the Dwarven Dungeons centuries after his death. Many casks of his holy brews still possessed their magical properties even as late as 1369 DR. In life, Durlin spent countless hours playing Chess with his best friend Drake in the Halls of Lights Chess Room.\nIn 1369 DR his ghost helped the heroes from Phlan who arrived at Myth Drannor to oppose the Cult of the Dragons evil plan. Durlin guided them to his hidden magic items in the Halls of Light."
