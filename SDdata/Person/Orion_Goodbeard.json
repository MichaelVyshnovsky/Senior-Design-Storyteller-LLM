The two were known of their explorations of the [[Shadowfell]]. Their shred gravestone read: \"Adventurers Alexer and Orion Goodbeard - Intrepid explorers of the Plane of Shadows.\" The Goodbeard grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and their bodies risen as a [[zombie]]s by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
