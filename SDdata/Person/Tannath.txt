Tannath was a swordcaptain of the Purple Dragons working in Suzail, Cormyr, in the late 15 century DR.
Tannath was watching dancers perform at the Dragonriders Club in Suzail one evening when he was summoned to the Bold Archer by a telsword on behalf of fellow swordcaptain Dralkin. At the Bold Archer, Seszgar Huntcrown had just been murdered, alongside much of his retinue, by two blueflame ghosts from the witness statements that they carried off the body, Tannath reasoned they were sent by someone.
