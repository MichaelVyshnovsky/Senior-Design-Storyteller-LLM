'''Tannath''' was a swordcaptain of the [[Purple Dragons]] working in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Tannath was watching dancers perform at the [[Dragonriders Club]] in [[Suzail]] one evening when he was summoned to [[the Bold Archer]] by a [[telsword]] on behalf of fellow swordcaptain [[Dralkin]]. At the Bold Archer, [[Seszgar Huntcrown]] had just been murdered, alongside much of his retinue, by two [[blueflame ghost]]s; from the witness statements that they carried off the body, Tannath reasoned they were sent by someone.
