Mizhena was a devout warrior of the god Tempus in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She traveled with the Flaming Fist, and later the Coalition in the .
She was a devout Tempuran and could not abide thieves of any sort.
Mizhena offered her services as a priest to those accompanying the Coalition forces.
She possessed a unique amulet that she lost during the War of the Shining Crusade. Around that time she also had her gold leaf prayer candle stolen by the traitor Malden Col.
While Mizhena was born male and raised as a boy, she understood in time that she was a woman. She eschewed her birth name and created the name "Mizhena" from syllables of words in several languages, each of which had special meaning to her. Thus she felt it truly reflected her.
