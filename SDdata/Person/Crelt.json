He wore leather armor and carried a club.\nHe was a pleasant individual, but had a dislike for too-helpful people, feeling he could do fine on his own. Crelt took his training as a psionicist very seriously.\nAlthough he frequently employed his psionic abilities, he was still a generally competent person without them.\nHe owned a suit of leather armor +3, a club +2, as well as a ring of invisibility.\nCrelt was born blind, and did not venture into the larger world before reaching middle age."
