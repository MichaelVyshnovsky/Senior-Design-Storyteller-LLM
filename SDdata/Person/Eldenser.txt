Eldenser, called "the Lurker" and "the Worm Who Hides in Blades", was a great wyrm amethyst dragon known for his magical ability to "jump" his sentience from blade to blade, which he used to travel Faer没n while his body lay magically preserved and protected in a crypt within the City of the Dead below Waterdeep.
Few witnesses had ever actually seen Eldenser in his true dragon form, but all reports agreed that he was male and, by the mid-to-late 14 century DR, he appeared absolutely ancient, even decrepit, with a body that seemed emaciated, frail, and moving wearily. His scales had paled nearly to white and his wings had become not much more than shreds dangling between their fingers. He had an array of white spines on his chin, giving the impression of a beard, and similar white spines over his eyes resembling tufted eyebrows. He had extra-large eyes, described to be both very wise and " twinkling with inner amusement". When he spoke or use telepathy, it was quietly and with a calm and dry voice, but he could shout and be heard for up to .
When sighted in his incorporeal form, Eldenser manifested a wraith-like apparition resembling his own head, which was the size of a human. A tail of wispy matter trailed from it.
At the core of Eldensers character, he was ever-curious about the world around him, in all its variety and change, and especially all the beings in it. He liked to observe people in all stages of life and learn how they appeared and acted and grew. In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, his favorite things to observe were the beauties of Faer没n the entertaining deeds of folk, especially of elves, half-elves, and humans and love of all kinds and the effect of love on people, namely what it could drive them to do. He also had a love of riddles and puzzles.
Despite this, Eldenser was himself a loner and he was truly contented with that. He preferred to avoid the company of his fellow dragons, by either ignoring them or concealing his presence. If found out, he remained calm and amiable, but cheerfully refused and resisted any attempt made to threaten or control him or the wielder of his blade, or to put this blade in their treasure hoard. He had no desire to fight and kill another dragon but no desire to run either, not wishing for the other to think themself his victor. Thus, he preferred to trick them and depart in peace, yet he was a formidable foe if provoked, finishing any fight quickly, if rather brutally, and with cunning and enthusiasm. Nevertheless, he was free-spirited and friendly.
From observations made over centuries, Eldenser had a deep understanding of events and their causes and effects, more so than most other inhabitants of Toril. He was thus wise, patient and more humble than other dragons, but also far more experienced and capable, being able to outwit others who put more effort into planning and to act suddenly with bold, even reckless action when he must. While he had desire to lure or trap others, he might manipulate beings and events to assist the wielder of his blade or just to observe the outcome, especially if it would reveal something of a persons character.
He was wanderer, rarely staying in one place, even before he gained the power to separate his mind from his body. And after, inside his swords, he could wander all around Faer没n as he willed. He did not consider any land his territory or domain as other dragons did rather, he considered all lands free for him to roam.
For prey, Eldenser preferred meat from the great cats, but would settle for cattle, and did so more than not. He also enjoyed human delicacies, namely sharp cheeses and fine wines. Strangely, he could even gain nourishment from blood spilled by the blades he inhabited.
Eldenser had all of the magical powers and psionic abilities of an amethyst dragon of great wyrm age, but his most notable ability was his means of transport. He had learned a spell or psionic power known as steelsteal that enabled him to leave his body and transport his mind into the blade of any metal edged weapon. In this way, he staved off death so far as he could, by leaving his withered body unused but preserved in stasis and protected. From within the blade, and from any metals in physical contact with the blade, he could see and hear as well as a human could and even speak via telepathy, though he was most often a silent observer. Using the same or a separate power, he could take on an invisible incorporeal form and jump from blade to blade as needed. To jump, the two blades needed to be  apart and immobile for three minutes, and Eldenser was incapable of speech and spellcasting. To go longer distances, he could adopt his incorporeal form and go "drifting" in search of a new blade, but he lost vitality over time and if he didnt find something in time, he would be forced to return to his body to recover.
He granted a blade much of his own resilience and ability to avoid negative effects, but successfully damaging it could cause him harm and breaking it forced him out in his incorporeal form. Heat and electricity did not affect him, and he could even absorb such energies to protect his wielder, but most blades turned brittle, so he was hesitant to do this. A blade inhabited by Eldenser did not become magical, but it could harm creatures that could only be struck by magical weapons. He could cast his own spells and powers by will alone, with their effects transmitted by touch of the blade or bursting from it, without the knowledge or command of the wielder, so they were usually surprised when it happened.
Although Eldenser could occupy any metal blade, he had a preference for swords of quality craftsmanship. He could occupy magical weapons and make their powers function for wielders who might otherwise be unable to use them. In magical swords that bore alignments, he preferred those that were partly or wholly neutral, and was uncomfortable with the "feel" of those of extremes. He also disliked being in intelligent weapons of any kind. He could easily control weak-willed weapons, though they went dormant for a few minutes while he took over and explored their powers and experiences. Strong-willed weapons and artifacts usually drove him out on contact. In any case, he wouldnt stay in such swords any longer than he had to and left when he perceived something more preferable. He didnt enjoy "drifting blind" in his incorporeal form to go looking. He wouldnt use his powers except to enable a transfer, such as attracting an adventurers attention in order to enter their own sword.
In addition, Eldenser had also mastered many other rare and exotic spells. As one example, he knew a spell to surround himself with a bright and deadly ring of blue-white energy for protection. Elminster theorized he could also sacrifice his own health, rather than psionic energy, to imitate specific psionic powers once a day. The spell just not there was so unique it worked only for Eldenser and hid him and his blade from magical detection. Circa 1372 DR, he had recently developed or acquired a new spell with which he could animate a non-magical blade weapon (smaller than that which he occupied, so usually a dagger), quietly and from within the blade he occupied. He used this to kill people he feared mightve discovered his presence and would try to control him.
However, exactly which psionic powers Eldenser commanded was unclear. Elminster cautioned that Eldenser could be far mightier in the Art than supposed from any accounting of his powers and abilities. Certainly, what powers were known were specifically only those exhibited while he inhabited a blade and he could cast these powers from a blade as well as from his own body. As a psion, he seemed to be dedicated to the discipline of psychokinesis.
From his habit of simply watching and learning, his powers of observation and eidetic memory, Eldenser was knowledgeable in a wide variety of fields, including geography, nature, noble and royal families, psionics, and the history and local affairs of the North. It was said he could know anything from the layouts of alleys and sewers of many cities to the hiding places of treasures, to how to cook a specific meal, no matter how complex. Eldenser was also skilled in mimicry and all forms of persuasion and deception. He spoke Draconic, Common and a number of human and elven languages.
While within a sword, Eldenser simply spent his time in silent observation of the people around it and particularly the people who wielded it. He preferred they remain unaware of his presence, or at the least that they ignore him, and he only revealed himself, either by speech or by powers, when he wished to or was forced to, and usually after a long period of observation. He would change swords when he became bored or was taken away from somewhere he wanted to be. Once he had departed a blade, he could never return to that particular blade.
He was not completely passive, however. Just as rulers, archmages, and other great dragons did, Eldenser sought to subtly influence politics and events to his own ends. His ends, though, were to help heroes, weaken the power of authorities, and create opportunities for his future entertainment and observation. While he learned much information, he was above selling it, though he might share some in exchange for adventurers performing some deed for him and letting him watch. He paid particular interest in spying on or else assisting anyone developing magic that could let a dragon regrow or replace an aged and decaying body such as his own. 
For himself, he was a seeker of Ossavitors Way, a secret to eternal life said to have been discovered by the dragon Ossavitor. He likely knew the entire process, or at least thought he did, and, while apparently unhurried and leisurely about it, Eldenser carefully but actively sought the material components for the procedure that would allow him to live forever in three separate dragon bodies. He regularly guided wielders of his blades to attack and slay dragons and sever specific body parts and these disappeared on contact with the blade, apparently being teleported to a secret store.
Elminster considered it likely that, if misfortune or his hazardous lifestyle did not befall him first, then Eldenser would indeed complete Ossavitors Way, having been so long at it. In fact, by the 1360s DR, he may even have already completed it or was only final step from completion. If so, then he might be hesitant to give up his current life or was developing his psionics to travel between his three bodies and his target blades.
Over the course of his life, Eldenser had formed many friendships with many heroic adventurers, with men and women of many races, as they were often the ones who could carry his blades, travel far, and show him some action. However, he was on his guard against spellcasters who sought to study the blade he resided in. Hed had some contact with members of the Harpers, and they had some knowledge of him.
He had been the life-long companion of several female humans and at least one elvenlady, but naturally had outlived all of them. In particular, Eldenser was said to have had alliances with the Simbul and possibly even with Sylun茅 and Dove Falconhand. Dove occasionally wielded Eldenser in large-scale conflicts with Thayans, Zhentarim, and other foes great in magic. Eldenser had no servants or minions, willing or not, that anyone was aware of. Furthermore, Eldenser had some interaction with Khelben Arunsun, having taught the Khelben bright and deadly ring, just not there, and steelsteal in exchange for other magic.
The only enemies of Eldenser were anyone who was currently annoying him, and he had no interest in carrying on a feud any longer than he needed to. Regardless, he would disrupt and destroy the Cult of the Dragon given the opportunity.
It was unknown if he had ever taken a mate.
Eldenser did not appear to keep an actual lair like other dragons, but he did maintain a number of places where he could hide his body and keep it safe and sealed against air and weather. He used at least a dozen caverns deep in mountains or on islands far out at sea that were quite inaccessible to others. However, he generally used a secure crypt within the City of the Dead in Waterdeep. To reach it, one must go through several portals, but these were trapped so that one who did not speak the correct password be would transported to some random destination, such as the outskirts of the ruins of Myth Drannor or a deep level of Undermountain. While there were no exact details of the defenses of the crypt itself, it was said to hold protective magical barriers like wardmists and mechanical construct guardians like helmed horrors.
A personal history of Eldenser the dragon was unknown rather, he was a figure of bard tales, little-known legends, and historical records appearing all around the North and dating back to at least the 8 century DR. Much of this seemed due to his habit of staying hidden and occupying blades, and only showing himself when he wished it.
Nevertheless, Eldenser was known to be a lone wanderer in his younger days, traveling around Faer没n and especially the Sword Coast North according to his whims and seemingly without purpose or pattern. In truth, as became clear from his later habits, he was simply doing what he loved learning everything he could about life. The earliest sighting described the dragon as aged and frail even then.
Once, Eldenser trespassed into the territory of Lorragauth, a very old black dragon whod decided to devastate his own domain when he felt death approaching. Spying the Lurker, Lorragauth swooped to attack. However, as he spread his wings to arrest his descent and reorient himself for a deadly pounce, Eldenser either calmly beat his wings once, rolled and rose abruptly under his foes right wing or veered away in the final instant. Either way, the action ripped Lorragauths right wing almost completely off, and the screaming dragon crashed to his death in the Neverwinter Wood, Three women of the house of the nomad lord Tharnor of the North witnessed the battle and gave an account of it.
In another great dragon duel, Eldenser flew from a gigantic red, but snatched a fishing boat right out of the water without even slowing. He then twisted about and used its mast as makeshift spear, plunging it into the red dragons eye, killing him before he could react, let alone slow down or avoid it.
However, the majority of actions attributed to him were in his role as the Worm Who Hides in Blades. Countless similar stories featured magic erupting unexpectedly from certain blades twenty or so of these were attributed to Eldenser by later sages and bards of the mid-1300s DR, but he was likely the source of many more. In one confirmed case, the infamous mage Arnaglym of Arrabar hurled a fireball at one swords wielder, only for Eldenser to reflect it back. It ignited vast, old, and very dry tapestries hanging from a huge hammerbeam ceiling under which Arnaglym was standing at the time, leading to Arnaglyms death in a raging fire. 
Eldenser once often frequented Candlekeep and Heralds Holdfast and their environs while researching all he could find about Ossavitors Way. Centuries later, in around the 1360s DR, he would return, though it was not known what he researched this time around.
In the early 1370s DRs, Eldenser was roaming around Amn and Tethyr and along trade routes from the Dragon Coast to Waterdeep. During the Dracorage of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, Eldenser evaded its effects by shifting his body into the Elemental Plane of Earth. He presumably returned once it had passed.
By the late 15 century DR, Eldenser had died, however his mind lingered on as a psionic projection that was able to continue inhabiting blades even in undeath. Because of this, there was widespread confusion as to whether or not he was indeed dead.
Despite being counted as one of the strangest and most interesting dragons of northwest Faer没n, Eldenser was actually relatively obscure, thanks to the low profile he kept. He was the subject of little-known legends and records of the North, where he was usually referred to as simply "the Lurker". Bards and storytellers gave him the grander title of "the Worm Who Hides in Blades". Eldenser became more well known when Volo wrote of him in a pamphlet on the wyrms of the North.
There were common yet unsubstantiated rumors that Eldenser was in fact the servant or even ally of one of the gods. Which god, and why, were not clear.
