Lord Tagreth Cormaeril was the Grandfather of Assassins of the Fire Knives in the late 14 century DR.
He tolerated no dissent within his organization.
Appearing as a frail and elderly man, Tagreth had unnatural vigor that came from magical sources. Using much of his wealth, he extended his lifespan and bolstered his health over many years.
