'''Ines''' was a curious [[thief]] inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
His house was located along the [[High Road (Daggerford)|High Road]] in central Daggerford.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}} Ines excelled at picking locks and detecting and disarming traps, but was woefully clumsy regarding any other roguish skills.
