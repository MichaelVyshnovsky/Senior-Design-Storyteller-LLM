Ines was a curious thief inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His house was located along the High Road in central Daggerford. Ines excelled at picking locks and detecting and disarming traps, but was woefully clumsy regarding any other roguish skills.
