Jarda was a halfling saluk inhabiting Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Jarda was a shrewd professional who distrusted others until they proved otherwise. Because of her paranoia she frequently dressed as a male to make it harder for anyone tracking her.
Because of her craving for sweets, which she often stole while roaming the city, Jarda developed a bit of a paunch.
Jarda owned a pair of bracers of defense +5, a magical short sword, a philter of glibness, and an assortment of thieving tools.
Though she was a successful adventurer in her own right, Jarda was actually a trusted agent of Prince Tannous al-Assad and frequently ran special errands for him.
