'''Danovar Clegg''' was a commoner from the village of [[West Harbor]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] ''circa'' 1374 [[DR]].

==Description==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Danovar was a middle-aged [[human]] man with salt and pepper hair. Despite being armed with a [[club]] and a simple [[shield]], he appeared unsure and wary, looking at strangers as if unsure if they were to hug him or stab him.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the recently rebuilt sire village of West Harbor was menaced by a duo of [[black dragon]]s. In fear of his home's destruction, Danovar Clegg, along with many other villages, picked up arms and began training in case West Harbor needed defending.
