The dwarf Adhamh (
Adhamh was a sturdy dwarf with a long gray beard and a receding hairline.
Adhamh was a simple man with simple means, who loved his job and who usually kept to himself while observing the guests visiting the cemetery. While he felt more at ease among the dead than the living, he still loved the occasional opportunity to gossip.
