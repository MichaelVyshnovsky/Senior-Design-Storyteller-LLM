'''Glek''' was a male [[goblin]] of [[Duskwood]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Glek was one of the goblins who inhabited the caves near Duskwood. He rebelled against the former leader and had some of the goblins follow him into the caves near Duskwood. In order to get a ring for a trial in [[1374 DR]], the Kalach-Cha needed to kill the spiders or slay Glek.
