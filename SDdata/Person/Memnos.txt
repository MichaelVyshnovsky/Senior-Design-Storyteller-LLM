'''Memnos''' was a [[tiefling]] from [[Elturel]] that was forced from his home for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|She didn't kill your brother [[Arka]]. You're better than this.|Memnos, speakign about Sazza.}}

==Personality==
He was a compassionate individual that looked out for the best interest of those he cared about.

==History==
Like other Elturian tieflings, Memnos was exiled from his home city following its [[the Descent|descent]] into the [[Nine Hells]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. He traveled with the former [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]] and others of their kind west towards [[Baldur's Gate]], but were forced to take refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] along the way due to [[goblin]] raids.

When [[Aradin]] and his adventurer companions carelessly led a band of goblins to the Emerald Grove, [[Kanon]] was killed by a goblinoid arrow. Memnos tried to console his sister [[Arka]], and prevent her from taking out her revenge on the captive goblin [[Sazza]].
