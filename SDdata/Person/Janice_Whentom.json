        "History": "Janice Whentom created ''caster's shield'' to further protect herself on the field of battle. She wore [[heavy armor]] and ''caster's shield'' to fight alongside her battalion in the front lines and support them with beneficial spells. However powerful the shield was, it did not offer absolute protection, and eventually, Janice was killed by a stray [[arrow]]. After her death, ''caster's shield'' was returned to her family as a sign of respect by her fellow soldiers who survived the battle."
