Seldinor Stormcloak was a male magelord who was one of the most powerful magelords of Athalantar.
As a tall man, Seldinor was attractive and extremely charismatic.
He had a retinue of apprentices and one of his favorite fields of study was the creation of golems.
Seldinor was a powerful member of the magelords from the start of their power, second only to Neldryn Hawklyn together with Kadeln Olothstar. 
Around 240 DR, the magelord had his head torn off by his own golem with the help of Elminster Aumar and Myrjala Talithyn.
