        "History": "Severin was part of the [[Volahk|Doomguide Volahk's]] contingent of priests and acolytes acolytes who entered [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] and disappeared within. In truth, the group was ambushed and assaulted by many [[undead]] guided by [[Red Wizard]]s, in an area known as [[the Rift]]. \n\nAfter their disappearance, Volahk recruited an [[adventurer]] to help find them. Severin was still alive within crypt under the watch of a sole Red Wizard. Once Severin was rescued, the adventurer was given enough information that they could continue the search for the other doomguides that were yet unaccounted for."
