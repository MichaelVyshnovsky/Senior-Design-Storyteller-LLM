        "mainbody": "'''Orlenstar Thirlthorn''' was a [[Chondathan]] [[human]] man living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was a [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] who tended to the [[God's Grove]] [[shrine]]. <ref group=\"note\">'' Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave'' names Orlenstar \"Thirthorn\", without the 'l', likely in error.",
        "History": "As a young man, Orlenstar was taking care of the God's Grove shrine by [[1358 DR]], and continued through [[1367 DR]] and [[1369 DR]]. He was still there in [[1374 DR]].\n\nBy [[Eleint]] of [[1374 DR|the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Orlenstar greeted the priests of the new [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in Wheloon, believing that [[magic]] could be considered as part of nature. However, he found the [[cleric]] who met him, [[Shan Thar]], to be patronizing and false to him. Upset by this, he didn't return.",
        "Personality": "Orlenstar was a gentle man, though of saturnine moods.",
        "Activities": "Orlenstar was officially the caretaker of the shrine of Silvanus and the grove of [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood trees]] it resided in. However, the God's Grove was a popular spot among Whelunians, so many other folk helped him with this. He spent most days in the grove, but lived in a cabin nearby.\n\nPeople took injured and sick animals to Orlenstar for his ministration. Orlenstar also kept a constant store of healing [[goodberry|goodberries]], as well as his homebrew [[spruce beer]].\n\nHe was available to train others in the ways of the druid, if they made suitable offerings to Silvanus."
