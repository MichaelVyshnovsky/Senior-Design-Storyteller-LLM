        "mainbody": "Orlenstar Thirlthorn was a Chondathan human man living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was a druid of Silvanus who tended to the Gods Grove shrine.  Cormyr The Tearing of the Weave names Orlenstar \"Thirthorn\", without the l, likely in error.\nAs a young man, Orlenstar was taking care of the Gods Grove shrine by 1358 DR, and continued through 1367 DR and 1369 DR. He was still there in 1374 DR.\nBy Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Orlenstar greeted the priests of the new Temple of Mystra in Wheloon, believing that magic could be considered as part of nature. However, he found the cleric who met him, Shan Thar, to be patronizing and false to him. Upset by this, he didnt return.\nOrlenstar was a gentle man, though of saturnine moods.\nOrlenstar was officially the caretaker of the shrine of Silvanus and the grove of duskwood trees it resided in. However, the Gods Grove was a popular spot among Whelunians, so many other folk helped him with this. He spent most days in the grove, but lived in a cabin nearby.\nPeople took injured and sick animals to Orlenstar for his ministration. Orlenstar also kept a constant store of healing goodberries, as well as his homebrew spruce beer.\nHe was available to train others in the ways of the druid, if they made suitable offerings to Silvanus."
