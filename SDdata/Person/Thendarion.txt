'''Thendarion''', also called '''the Wizard of the Boot''', was a [[wizard]] from the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]]. He was trapped in the form of a [[boot]].

==History==
Some time in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]] (around 80 years before [[1370 DR]]), Thendarion was a wizard who engaged in a spell-duel with another mage. According to tales, his rival was still alive by [[1370 DR]], and was in fact a [[Zulkir]] of [[Thay]], presumed to be [[Szass Tam]] himself. Thendarion lost and was cursed to be trapped in the form of a boot forever.

In time, Thendarion was able to modify the spells he remembered to gain some freedom. However, sheer boredom had driven him insane.

It was unknown how and when he came to [[Elgath's Provisions]] (established in the late 1340s DR), but he took up residence there and always returned. Shoppers came to think the place was haunted. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] wrote of him in ''[[Volo's Guide to the Dalelands]]''. He was still lurking amongst the merchandise in [[1370 DR]].

==Powers==
A side-effect of Thendarion's curse was that he could never forget the [[spell]]s he'd had in his mind when afflicted, but nor could he learn new spells. However, he eventually learned modifications to his familiar spells. He could cast spells freely and at-will, but they often went wild because of the curse. For example, a simple attempt to conjure [[light]] could well turn a [[:Category:Trees|tree]] blue, set it aflame, or turn it into a rain of dying [[fish]]. 

Two spells remained reliable and useful: ''[[shapechange]]'' and ''[[teleport]]''. With ''shapechange'', he could take the form of any nonliving object of about the same volume as his standard boot form, in a manner similar to a [[peltast]], such as a [[lamp]] or [[knife]], but he apparently preferred a [[lantern]] or a coil of [[rope]].

The curse could not be lifted even after several expensive attempts. It was said by some that the curse warned the caster of attempts to tamper with it, and might even transfer to whoever did so. The rumored identity of the caster also made such efforts dangerous.

==Activities==
Bored witless, Thendarion attempted to get himself bought by [[adventurer]]s visiting Elgath's Provisions, changing shape accordingly, so he could go on adventures with them and have fun. He often attempted to help, changing form to whatever was needed or casting spells to assist, but the attempts usually caused chaos, making him a nuisance.

When bored of his owners, or when they disposed of him, retired, or died, Thendarion teleported back to the store to wait for a new opportunity. If his purchasers returned him to the store, then [[Elgath]] the proprietor always gave a full refund, politely but reluctantly. Elgath sought out mages to undo the curse and rid himself of Thendarion, but each effort did nothing but cost him.
