Urgund was a man who was once held captive in the lower planes. He wrote of his experience in Urgunds Description of Darkness, some time before the midâ€“14 century DR. Although it was a grim work, it was not much more than a listing of names and palaces, for the horrors within them were too horrible to set down on paper.
