        "mainbody": "Sasha was a Council Clerk and, later, the youngest Councilmember of the Council of Ten from the city of Phlan in the mid 14 century DR.\nBy the , Sasha joined the Council of Ten as its youngest member in recognition of her prolific successes in dealing with the Silver Blades that enriched Phlans coffers, as well as aiding in purging the city of corruption a decade prior.\nKimarr was a one-time ally of Phlan but revealed himself as a traitor and sought to use Sasha as a bargaining chip allying with Banes forces. He found a way to magically enslave ogres and giants of Taydomes Keep. His forces captured Sasha, Bostell – one of her bodyguards, and a fellow mage and ally of Phlan – Quil. Subsequently, Sasha was freed by the heroes of Phlan, while Kimarr was slain after he transformed himself into a fierce blue dragon."
