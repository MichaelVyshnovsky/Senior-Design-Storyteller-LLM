'''Sial Sapphire''' was one of the lieutenants of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Sial was a very successful solitary thief.

In 1479 DR, [[Kal'dir]] finally found her and offered her an opportunity to meet the new [[Xanathar]]. In front of the [[beholder]], Sial challenged its authority, proclaiming herself the best burglar of the city and accusing the Xanathar's agents of being inefficient. Impressed, the Xanathar offered Sial a position as a lieutenant in the Xanathar's Guild and she accepted.

In time, she also became the guild's spymaster.[[Derek Myers]]. "The Xanathar: Beholder Crime Lord of Waterdeep." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.  

==Activities==
Sial supervised all the guild's activities involving thieving and burglary. She also directed the spy network of the guild, often discovering things that [[Kal'dir]], [[Quid]], or [[Draak]] believed they'd kept secret.

==Personality==
Sial was a natural chameleon and could change her attitude and personality as needed. So nobody knew if she lied or not. Sial was a master manipulator. In many ways, she was like a [[drow]] at heart.

==Residence==
Sial had no stable home, normally wandering all of the city's districts.

==Relationship==
Sial knew of [[Kal'dir]]'s fascination for her.
