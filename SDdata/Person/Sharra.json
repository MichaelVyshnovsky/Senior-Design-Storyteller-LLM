        "mainbody": "Sharra, who was nicknamed Sharra of the Invisible Dragon, was an archmage who inhabited the city of Waterdeep.\nSharra was famous for rousing the city of Neverwinter by using her magic so that every citizen in the city heard her warning when Calishite forces attempted a surprise attack a night. When she was still an apprentice in Waterdeep she blasted down a building in an escape when she got caught between rival wizards slinging spells at each other. The alley where she blasted the building was later called Sharras Flight."
