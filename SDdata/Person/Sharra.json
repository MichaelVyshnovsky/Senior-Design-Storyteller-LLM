        "mainbody": "'''Sharra''', who was nicknamed '''Sharra of the Invisible Dragon''', was an [[archmage]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "History": "Sharra was famous for rousing the city of [[Neverwinter]] by using her [[magic]] so that every citizen in the city heard her warning when [[Calishite]] forces attempted a surprise attack a night. When she was still an apprentice in Waterdeep she blasted down a building in an escape when she got caught between rival [[wizard]]s slinging [[spell]]s at each other. The alley where she blasted the building was later called [[Sharra's Flight]]."
