        "mainbody": "Mirande Palemedes was a Zhent half-elf cleric of Loviatar and a spy in the service of Lord Orgauth of Zhentil Keep, who operated in Halfhap around 1369 DR.\nMirande was a petite woman, though her magical equipment gave her enormous strength.\nShe was intensely pious and devoted to Loviatar, and was a rather good liar and trickster.\nMirande did not present herself as a servant of Loviatar when in Cormyr and hid her holy symbol. For combat purposes, she wore ceremonial scale mail with a breastplate, and magically enhanced her strength with a girdle of storm giant strength. She then used this strength to crush her enemies in melee with her +4 morning star. She also carried several vials of unholy water, lawful evil candles of invocation, and a shroud of resurrection. As she needed to travel long distances across the Stonelands, she also had a light riding horse.\nIn the , she commanded a a team of spies including Kalor Ovrabek. Their mission was to study the defenses of Cormyrs northern border, but they also attacked and looted vulnerable adventurers in the wilderness to glorify Zhentil Keep and capture more treasure.\nAs part of their public identities in Cormyr, Mirande and Kalor pretended to be a married couple. They enjoyed the lifestyle so much that they continued it in private."
