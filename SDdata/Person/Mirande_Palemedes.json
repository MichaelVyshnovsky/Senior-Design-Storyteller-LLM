        "mainbody": "'''Mirande Palemedes''' was a [[Zhent]] [[half-elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Loviatar]] and a spy in the service of Lord [[Orgauth]] of [[Zhentil Keep]], who operated in [[Halfhap]] around [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Mirande was a petite woman, though her magical equipment gave her enormous strength.",
        "Personality": "She was intensely pious and devoted to Loviatar, and was a rather good liar and trickster.",
        "Possessions": "Mirande did not present herself as a servant of Loviatar when in Cormyr and hid her [[holy symbol]]. For combat purposes, she wore ceremonial [[scale mail]] with a [[breastplate]], and magically enhanced her strength with a ''[[girdle of storm giant strength]]''. She then used this strength to crush her enemies in melee with her ''+4 [[morning star]]''. She also carried several vials of ''[[unholy water]]'', ''[[lawful evil]] [[Candle of invocation|candles of invocation]]'', and a ''[[shroud of resurrection]]''. As she needed to travel long distances across the [[Stonelands]], she also had a light [[riding horse]].",
        "Activities": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, she commanded a a team of spies including [[Kalor Ovrabek]]. Their mission was to study the defenses of [[Cormyr]]'s northern border, but they also attacked and looted vulnerable [[adventurer]]s in the wilderness to glorify Zhentil Keep and capture more treasure.",
        "Relationships": "As part of their public identities in Cormyr, Mirande and Kalor pretended to be a married couple. They enjoyed the lifestyle so much that they continued it in private."
