Shhuusshuru, also known as Shadow Wing was a great wyrm shadow dragon turned dracolich who made her domain in the Far Hills of the Western Heartlands by the midâ€“14 century DR.
She was sired sometime before the founding of Cormyr in 26 DR by the shadow dragon Shadraxil, who had many other offspring.
In , she gave birth to Aurgloroasa (later a leader of the Cult of the Dragon), who remained in her mothers domain for almost two centuries.
Shhuusshuru preceded her daughters ascension to dracolichdom with the help of a nascent Cult cell in Berdusk, some time around the early 14 century DR. Originally, this was just to gain more power in the Western Heartlands but eventually she took over leadership of the cell.
It was at her insistence that the Berduskan cells second attempt at creating a Sacred One was to involve the red dragon Greshrukk "Red Eye". This plan involved luring a party of adventurers, who had acquired his stolen phylactery (in the form of a sword pommel), to his cave. They would then ambush them, steal the sword, and perform a ritual that would quickly transfer his essence to his corpse, but this failed.
Shhuusshuru remained active by 1374 DR.
From her lair in the tallest of the Far Hills, she plotted to take over Darkhold and from there conquer the entire Chionthar river valley.
She maintained a loose alliance with her daughter Aurgloroasas cell in Sembia.
