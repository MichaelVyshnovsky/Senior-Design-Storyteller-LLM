'''Shhuusshuru''', also known as '''Shadow Wing''' was a [[great wyrm]] [[shadow dragon]] turned [[dracolich]] who made her domain in the [[Far Hills]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|5}}

==History==
She was sired sometime before the founding of [[Cormyr]] in [[26 DR]] by the shadow dragon [[Shadraxil]], who had many other offspring.

In {{YearlinkName|426}}, she gave birth to [[Aurgloroasa]] (later a leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]), who remained in her mother's domain for almost two centuries.<ref>

Shhuusshuru preceded her daughter's ascension to dracolichdom with the help of a nascent Cult cell in [[Berdusk]], some time around the early 14{{th}} century DR. Originally, this was just to gain more power in the Western Heartlands but eventually she took over leadership of the cell.

It was at her insistence that the Berduskan cell's second attempt at creating a Sacred One was to involve the [[red dragon]] [[Greshrukk|Greshrukk "Red Eye"]]. This plan involved luring a party of adventurers, who had acquired his stolen [[phylactery]] (in the form of a sword pommel), to his cave. They would then ambush them, steal the sword, and perform a ritual that would quickly transfer his essence to his corpse, but this failed.

Shhuusshuru remained active by [[1374 DR]].

==Activities==
From her lair in the tallest of the Far Hills, she plotted to take over [[Darkhold]] and from there conquer the entire [[River Chionthar|Chionthar]] river valley.

==Relations==
She maintained a loose alliance with her daughter Aurgloroasa's cell in [[Sembia]].
