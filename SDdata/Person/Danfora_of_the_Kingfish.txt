'''Danfora of the Kingfish''' was a [[drow]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Danfora had long white wavy hair and she wore a [[circlet]] and a set of [[light armor]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a large group of [[duergar]], [[giant spider]]s, and drow, was slaughtered in the home of a [[Bloomridge Park]] groundskeeper, [[Lavernica]]. The murder spree was performed by [[Orin the Red]] and her [[Murder Tribunal]] of [[Bhaal]]. Danfora's butchered body was found in a cellar underneath Lavernica's home, near a slaughtered drow woman, a grotesque display â€“ an effigy representing [[Sendai]], a drow [[Bhaalspawn]] who died a century earlier.
