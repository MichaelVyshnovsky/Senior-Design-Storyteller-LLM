Brester Orthwood was the most competent son of House Orthwood, a fairly new noble house in Cormyr circa 1372 DR.
He was fairly spontaneous in personality, and would gallop wildly into whatever his latest enthusiasm was. Crown agents kept a close eye on him to see if he would make something of himself.
He was a competent fighter, and this led him to getting noticed by agents of the Crown.
