        "mainbody": "Mara Trollsblood was a half-orc guard in Zhent-occupied Daggerdale in the 1360s DR.\nIn 1367 DR, Mara was hired by Red Morgan to guard his caravan from Dagger Falls to Zhentil Keep. After a battle with a band of Freedom Riders and another with a goblin pack, Mara was left the only guard with a horse.\nMara loved taking prisoners, tying them loosely, and killing them when they tried to escape."
