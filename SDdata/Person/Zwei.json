The variator introduced the three successively more powerful extension spells in the years 1280 to 1300 NY of Netherils Silver Age.\nAll other facts about Zweis life (including his or her gender) were lost to history.Arcane Age sources contain only information about Zwei related to the spells bearing his or her name.\nThe Zweihausen were a pair of enormous houses on Netherese territory that were destroyed during the rise of human civilization. It is not known if Zwei was related to the Zweihausen or the namesake Zweihaus River.\"Zwei\" is German for \"two\", as in \"Zweihausen\" for \"two houses\"."
