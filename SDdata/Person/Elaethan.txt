'''Elaethan''' was an [[elf]] [[wraith]] guarding the Sacred Vale in [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a wispy white shadow, trailing off into smoke below the waist.

==Personality==
Elaethan had grown rather aggressive about protecting the Vale, and showed the beginning of some sadistic tendencies.

==Abilities==
He could mind-read people. He was also largely unaffected by spells that destroyed undead, or even ''[[chain lightning]]''. 

==Activities==
He was a guardian of the [[Sacred Vale]].

==Relationships==
One of his fellow guardians was named [[Norlorn]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, Elaethan arrived at the scene after [[Elminster Aumar]] escaped [[Heldebran]]. He mind-read Heldebran as the mage threatened them; after his fellow Noldorn left Heldebran at the mercy of his own [[mage-killer]], slaying him and then the mage-killer itself, he remarked that the mage should've suffered more.
