{{Quote|If you want the right to fill orders in this market, you'll have to impress one of our clients. I've already arranged a meeting...|Tearah Initoo}}

==Personality==
She was very proud of Port Nyanzaru's long history of trade and crafting.

==Activities==
As Master of the Market, Initoo and her associates oversaw all trade within Port Nyanzaru's [[Red Bazaar|Bazaar]] and ensured that the market's needs were met. She also worked alongside local merchant consortiums and craftspeople to enforce the monopolies of the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant princes]] and ensure payment of taxes. In addition, she coordinated special orders from important clients, matching them to approved merchants or craftspeople.

Foreign merchants and craftspeople wanting to sell their wares in Port Nyanzaru were directed to speak with the Master of the Market, who could connect them to agents of the merchant prince who controlled the trade and sale of the relevant goods. For instance, [[alchemist]]s and those dealing in alchemical supplies or [[potion]]s might be directed to [[Giregi Igiri]], while [[smith]]s and [[weapon]] merchants might be directed to [[Silaha Mnunzi]].

==History==
[[File:Master of the market - MMO.PNG|thumb|''Tearah Initoo at the Bazaar in her role as Master of the Market.'']]
During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Tearah received special orders from the likes of the wealthy heiress [[Teyileri Siwifi]] (seeking to buy a magnificent necklace), the guard captain [[Uponga Naodha]] (seeking to acquire foreign [[titansteel]] armor), the huntress [[Mirea Sain]] (seeking a [[leatherworker]] to make gear for the [[Hunters' Guild of Chult]]), the [[artificer]] [[Chonigi Tomi]] (seeking objects touched by the [[Far Realm]]), and the foreign merchant [[Sofia Chiaroscuro]] (hoping to reclaim her confiscated goods).
