Grimwald was a skilled wizard who lived in Tilverton.
Grimwald reportedly threatened vengeance on those who destroyed a magic item he crafted that could turn people into frogs and allow him to steal their goods. Grimwalds Revenge, an inn found in Tilverton, was named in his "honor." The inn even had a small population of frogs living within its walls.
