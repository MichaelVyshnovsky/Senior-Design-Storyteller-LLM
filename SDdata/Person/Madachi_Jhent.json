        "mainbody": "Madachi Jhent was a disgraced nobleman of Waterdeep who proclaimed himself the High Minister of Ao before being killed sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nMadachi was an infamous individual in the City of Splendors whose story spread across Waterdeep like wildfire shortly after the Time of Troubles. He was a minor noble who lost all his wealth but delved into a delusion that convinced him to lead the new church after seeing a vision of Ao, the High God of Toril in his cloak. He started his preaching career proselytizing to a pen of pigs and pronounced damnations on sinners who resided in a bowl of soup. Madachis infamy came after he started preaching gibberish to a group of poor Waterdhavians who eventually became agitated. The High Minister kicked a homeless man in the face and that act somehow cured the poor wretchs blindness (as the penniless noble was wearing enchanted boots later known as A Mad Gents Boots). This miraculous deed attracted a gaggle of followers to the so-called \"High Minister.\" New auditions to Madachis church lacked the fire of insanity that ignited the \"High Ministers\" passionate Kicking Crusade across Waterdeep.\nMiraculously, Madachi Jhents kicks did not cause the crazed ministers demise, as his followers valiantly protected him. Eventually, as the Kicking Crusade continued, minister Jhent realized his kicks did no miracles as the victims of his kicks were not suffering from illness. However, another \"miracle\" was taking place. As Madachi helped his victims up from the streets, his gloves, later known as A Mad Gents Gloves, cured those he touched. This attracted yet another wave of followers to the misguided church.\nThe High Minister of Ao spent several next days touching people after kicking them, spreading the healing \"miracle.\" But his foolish luck ended when he kicked a grimly-armored cleric of Bane in the face. The cleric was a follower of then the dead god of hatred and tyranny and retaliated by throttling the dimwitted miracle dispenser. Madachi demanded to be unhanded because \"no servant of a dead god is fit to touch a servant of Ao.\" Despite not having divine magics at his disposal, the priest of Bane handled the \"High Minister\" and his gaggle of lunatics with ease."
