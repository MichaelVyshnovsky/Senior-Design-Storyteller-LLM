        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], Pharx was the strongest ally of the Dragon's Hoard group in [[Skullport]]. In her plan to destroy them, [[Liriel Baenre]] convinced her longtime friend, the mutated deep dragon [[Zz'Pzora]], to dispose of Pharx. Zz'Pzora approached Pharx in a Skullport bar, where he was drinking disguised as a [[polymorph]]ed [[drow]] male, and seduced him. Once in his lair, she attacked him. A fierce battle ensued resulting in Pharx's death. However, Zz'Pzora also received fatal injures."
