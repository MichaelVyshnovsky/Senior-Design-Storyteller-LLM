        "mainbody": "'''Lumbar''' was a strange beggar â€“ a sentient [[zombie]], who shambled across the alleys of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Come to have a go? Give it your best shot.''|Strange Beggar Lumbar}}",
        "Description": "Lumbar was wrapped in rags, his face hidden under a hood and a scarf. Lumbar's sickly yellow skin and stench of decay betrayed his [[undead]] zombie nature. Like other zombies, however, he was fully conscious and possessed undead fortitude and resistance to all types of physical damage.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lumbar could be seen in an alleyway in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] near the [[Basilisk Gate]]. The zombie made [[coin]] by allowing people to hit him. A single punch cost them 15 [[gold]] pieces."
