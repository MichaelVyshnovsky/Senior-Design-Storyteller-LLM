        "mainbody": "'''Skittle''', also known as the '''Great Collector''' or the '''Merchant of Mysteries''' among his furry kin, was a simple [[rat]] who prided itself for collecting great artifacts from the [[Flaming Fist]] prison and the barracks in the [[Basilisk Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''A new client? What a thrill - for you, rat-urally!''|Skittle}}",
        "Description": "Skittle was an unassuming male rat with brown coat.",
        "Possessions": "The vermin merchant collected various [[spell]] [[scroll]]s and [[thieves' tools]], as well as a key from one of the [[Counting House]] secure vaults, and a single ''[[elixir of universal resistance]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the rodent Merchant of Mysteries inhabited the Flaming Fist prison in the Basilisk Gate of Baldur's Gate. The rat scurried along the nooks and pipes of the prion and collected items it thought to be artifacts. Those capable of ''[[speaking with animals]]'' could convince the Great Collector to part with some of its erasure for [[coin]]."
