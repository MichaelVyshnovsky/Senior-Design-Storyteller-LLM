'''Liono Marlot''' was the tactician of the [[hammership]], the ''[[Probe]]''.

==Description==
Liono was a short and slender man. He had a quick tongue.

==Relationships==
Liono was good friends with the ship's weapons master [[Bubbo]], and the two spent much of their off-time sharing drinks in the officer's saloon aboard the ''Probe''. He was also a long-time friend of the first-mate [[Aelfred Silverhorn]].

==History==
On the journey from [[Krynn]] to [[Toril]], while in the [[Phlogiston|flow]], the ''Probe'' was attacked by a [[neogi deathspider]]. As tactician, Liono's advice was to run fast, not because of cowardice, but because a deathspider's most powerful armaments were at its aft. Bubbo argued instead that they should turn and face the deathspider, since the hammership's most powerful weapons could only fire forward. The first-mate ultimately chose Bubbo's plan.

During the battle, the spidership pinned the smaller vessel in its grappling ram, and the ''Probe'' was boarded by [[human]] and [[demihuman]] slaves and raging [[umber hulk]]s. During the bloody fight, Liono was impaled by a spear thrown from one of the assailants.
