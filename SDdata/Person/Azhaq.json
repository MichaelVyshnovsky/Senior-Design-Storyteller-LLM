        "History": "In 1373 DR, Azhaq and his fellow [[Moonwing]] were sent to capture the rebellious [[song dragon]] [[Karasendrieth]], but were defeated by [[Dorn Graybrook]]'s team. \n\nBecause of his failure, Lareth, corrupted by the Rage, tried to kill him, but the [[gold dragon]] [[Llimark]] saved his life in the last minute.\n\nAfter the [[metallic dragon]]s changed their minds and decided to join the fight against [[Sammaster]], Azhaq helped break the [[chromatic dragon]]s' siege of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].\n\nAfter the [[metallic dragon]]s changed their minds and decided to join the fight against [[Sammaster]], Azhaq along his fellow Talons were sent to attack Sammaster's citadel. In the final battle, most of the Talons of Justice died, including their leader, [[Havarlan]]. \n\nAfter the Rage, Azhaq tasked himself with rebuilding the Talons of Justice, stronger than before, eventually ascending to the rank of leader of the order. He re-structured the order, allowing gold and [[bronze dragon]]s, as well as [[Half-dragon|gold and silver half-dragon]]s, to join the order to bolster its numbers.\n\nHe also worked alongside the gold dragons [[Larendrammagar]] and [[Tamarand]] in some missions. Their last mission was to help the Talons locate a former member of the order who had become a rebel, the dragon [[Arendelonthos]]."
