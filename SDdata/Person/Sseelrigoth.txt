Sseelrigoth was a blight dragon from the Shadowfell.
When Tchazzar was wounded by the Spellplague and traveled through a rift between the Prime Material Plane and the Shadowfell, Sseelrigoth subdued and imprisoned him. Sseelrigoth fed from Tchazzars essence for nearly 100 years until Jhesrhi Coldcreek rescued him from his imprisonment. Once freed, Tchazzar slaughtered Sseelrigoth and returned to the Prime Material Plane.
