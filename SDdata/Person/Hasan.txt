'''Hasan''' was a Grandfather of the [[Everlasting]] in [[Zakhara]].{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|22}}

==History==
After the destruction of their base by [[mamluk]]s from [[Qudra]], Hasan discovered the existence of the fortress of [[Sarahin]] from one of his loyal followers. He carefully planned to claim that fortress for the Everlasting. Though thwarted by the sheikh of Sarahin, Hasan eventually negotiated a clever deal where the sheikh would sell him all of the land that would fit within a single ox hide. After the sheikh agreed to the deal before his entire court, Hasan cut the ox hide into thin strips and surrounded Sarahin with the strips, claiming the fortress for the Everlasting.
