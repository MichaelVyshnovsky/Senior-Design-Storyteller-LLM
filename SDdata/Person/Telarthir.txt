Telarthir, or Great Telarthir, Emperor of the Ninth Dynasty of Lords was a long-forgotten ruler of a long-forgotten kingdom of antiquity.
Telarthir lived many centuries before 1372 DR, and by the 14 century DR, he, nor his dynasty, nor his kingdom was remembered. His final resting place was within a well-hidden tomb in the Brush of Barbs of Delimbiyr Vale. Telarthirs tombs location was known to only few and several maps that led to it existed and were sold for mere change, though to be fakes.
In his eternal rest, Telarthir was preserved as a warrior mummy who along with his servant skeleton warriors guarded the tomb. An unwitting aspiring adventurer Fernigold the Younger gained entrance to the tomb but was slain by the mummy.
