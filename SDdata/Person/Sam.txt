Sam the Farmer was one of the humble folk who worked the apple orchards in the Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Most of the time, Sam could be found in the orchards across the way from Daggerford Graveyard and not far from the water mill and grain silos. Unlike his fellow worker Josef, Sam had a foul attitude and miserable demeanor, often being rude to passers-by who dared to greet him.
