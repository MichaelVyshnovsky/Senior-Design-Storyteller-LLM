Glavyn was a guard at Castle Felmorel in the midâ€“8 century DR.
He had a famously bad temper.
He wielded a mace and dagger, or a sword.
He was the shortest of the three guards. During his encounter with Wanlorn, he used a cheerful, angry voice. His eyes were blazing green.
As a guard, he served Lord Esbre Felmorel. His fellows in the task included Feiryn, and Errart.
One rainy spring afternoon in the , Glavyn tried to turn away a magic user claiming his own name was Wanlorn, who insisted he was there to join Lord Esbre Felmorel at one of his feasts. Glavyn rebuffed the man repeatedly, until the man used a spell to freeze Glavyns arms in a cross-armed position, and then Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel ushered him in, much to Glavyns annoyance.
That evening, after the Lady Nasmaerae Felmorels spells were broken by Azuth, who let her off with a warning, Glavyn was one of the three soldiers that came to the aid of Lord Esbre, on whom an enthralling spell had been broken. Glavyn helped Lord Esbre in forcing her to cast another spell, which as per Azuths warning, broke her ability to use spells forevermore.
