'''Ubar khel Muhif''' was the Caliph of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Umara]] in [[north Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.

==Activities==
Ubar was the Khan of the [[Astok]] hill tribe of barbarians who inhabited the [[Furrowed Mountains]] near Umara. After becoming [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]], Ubar offered his services to Umara's former Caliph. He staged a [[Umara Rebellion|rebellion]] within the palace during a battle between Umara and [[Muluk]], seizing the throne for himself and marrying Princess [[Maran ber Ubar]] to solidify his claim. Order was reestablished in Umara before troops from [[Qudra]] arrived, so Ubar was accepted as the new Caliph of Umara in order to prevent a prolonged siege of the city.
