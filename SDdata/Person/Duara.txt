Duara was a mage and a good friend of Elminster.
She had dark eyes and flowing black hair. She wore a scanty gown, the front of which appeared to be made of glowing animated flowers.
Duara came to reside in Telflamm and joined the Harpers in 1335 DR. Aspiring to improve her magical powers, she came across a dragon, whose treasure hoard contained a key important to Elminster. She contacted Elminster openly, not realizing that the key was of importance to anyone else but him, and subsequently her home came under attack by people seeking the key.
In 1336 DR, Duara met Elminster at a magefair and gave him the key. This had to be done in secret because they were both worried about spies of their enemies being present, so Duara grabbed Elminster into a long kiss, during which she transferred the key to him. The key fitted into a smiling dragon head in the wall of Elminsters tower, which opened a concealed door, behind which Elminster kept a collection of old spellbooks.
