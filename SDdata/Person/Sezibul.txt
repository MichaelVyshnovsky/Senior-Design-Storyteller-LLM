Sezibul was an orc shaman around 1485 DR.
Sezibul was the shaman of the Fanged Moon tribe until 1485, when a pale orc gathered the Fanged Moon, Gory Maul, and Jagged Scythe tribes under his command. Sezibul was the only previous leader to survive under the new leader. Sezibul commanded day-to-day activities in their headquarters in the ruins of Harpshield Castle.
Later, he was killed by an adventuring party hired to search the Delimbiyr Bloke.
