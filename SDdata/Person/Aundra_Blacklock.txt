'''Aundra Blacklock''' was a powerful [[raptoran]] [[sorceress]] who was the owner of a tenement building known as the [[God Catcher]] in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. She lived in a [[magic]]al sphere that hovered above the building.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], [[Clytemorrenestrix]], a [[blue dragon]] changed into a [[human]] by the [[Spellplague]], came to Aundra and asked her to reverse the effect, something that Aundra claimed was within her power. Aundra asked Clytemorrenestrix to break into a shop and steal a magical mask owned by the [[green dragon]] [[Andareunarthex]]. Aundra knew that the dragons would come into conflict and that one would either be killed or driven from Waterdeep. However, even though Clytemorrenestrix returned the mask to Aundra, she didn't change her back into a dragon.

==Description==
Aundra's head looked like a hawk's and she had white feathers.
