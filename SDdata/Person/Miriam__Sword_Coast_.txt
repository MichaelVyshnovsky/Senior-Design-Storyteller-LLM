'''Miriam''' was a woman from the [[Sword Coast]] who fell in love with the man named [[Edmund]] who became a [[warlock]].

==History==
At some point in her life, Miriam became indebted to [[Maggie Two-Fingers]]. Somehow, Maggie learned of Miriam's name and began harassing her for the money. Miriam's lover Edmund took decisive action. He agreed to an [[infernal pact]] with a [[cambion]] to gain [[warlock]] powers and joined a mercenary group to earn money, and pay back Miriam's debt.
