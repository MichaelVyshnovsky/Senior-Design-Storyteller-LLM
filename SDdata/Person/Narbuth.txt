'''Narbuth''' was a caravan guard of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was stouter than [[Storstil]].

==Personality==
He never stopped cracking jokes, even to himself.

==History==
Narbuth was one of the guards in [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan in late {{yearlink|1357}}, on the route from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]], which [[Shandril Shessair]] joined.

During the ambush, [[Narm Tamaraith]] used his spells to save Narbuth's life; to prevent him from running all the way across the caravan to his wife, Shandril, Narbuth and Orthil knocked him out and tied him up.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|102-103|7}} He tended to Narm's injuries afterwards.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|106|7}}{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|119|8}} He bound Narm somewhat tightly, per [[Arauntar]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|131|8}}

He was later slain during another ambush.
