Narbuth was a caravan guard of the mid-14 century DR.
He was stouter than Storstil.
He never stopped cracking jokes, even to himself.
Narbuth was one of the guards in Orthil Voldovans caravan in late , on the route from Scornubel to Waterdeep, which Shandril Shessair joined.
During the ambush, Narm Tamaraith used his spells to save Narbuths life to prevent him from running all the way across the caravan to his wife, Shandril, Narbuth and Orthil knocked him out and tied him up. He tended to Narms injuries afterwards. He bound Narm somewhat tightly, per Arauntar.
He was later slain during another ambush.
