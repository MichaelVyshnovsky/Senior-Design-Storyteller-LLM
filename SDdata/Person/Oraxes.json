        "History": "In his youth, he was forced to live in the arcane ghetto with other magic-users. He supported himself using his art to commit petty crimes.\t\n\nWhen [[Chessenta]] went to war with [[Threskel]] in [[1479 DR]], Oraxes fought alongside the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]]. While fighting for the Brotherhood, he fell in love with a young [[necromancer]] named [[Meralaine]]. Oraxes later joined the Brotherhood and was assigned to remain in Threskel, supposedly hunting for resisters loyal to [[Alasklerbanbastos]] while [[Aoth Fezim]] was in [[Akanûl]]. When wyrmkeepers from the Church of [[Tiamat]] showed up at the Brotherhood's encampment, he used an illusion to make them believe he was Aoth. The wyrmkeepers saw through the disguise and captured both Oraxes and Meralaine. They managed to escape, killing several wyrmkeepers in the process.",
        "Personality": "Oraxes was rebellious and quick to anger.",
