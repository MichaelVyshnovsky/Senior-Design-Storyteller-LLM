Ilund Marhymbel and his brother Vromur Marhymbel ran the well-reputed Marhymbel House Shipways shipwright business out of Sarshel in Impiltur, in the 1490s DR.
By the late 15 century DR, Ilund and Vromur were second-generation shipbuilders. They produced reinforced and rugged top-quality naval vessels in reasonably fast timeframes, earning the reputation of being some of the best shipwrights of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
