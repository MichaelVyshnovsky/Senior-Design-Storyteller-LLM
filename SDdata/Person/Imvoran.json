        "History": "By {{yearlink|1357}}, Imvoran had been in service to the Zhentarim for a dozen years. Late that year, while in Manshoon's presence, he witnessed the [[spellfire]]-induced death of [[Drauthtar Inskirl]], when the latter teleported to the High Lord's throne room, fatally injured by [[Shandril Shessair]]'s spellfire. That was the first time he saw fear in Manshoon's face."
