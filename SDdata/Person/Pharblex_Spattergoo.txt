Pharblex Spattergoo was the chief and shaman of the bullywug tribe in the Mere of Dead Men during the time of the Tyranny of Dragons in 1489.
Pharblex greatly enjoyed tormenting the lizardfolk, thanks to Dralmorrer Borngray putting them under his control, and he killed the lizardfolk chief Suncaller.
In battle, Pharblex wore studded leather and fought with a spear and shield.
Pharblexs bullywugs acted as servants and henchmen for the Cult of the Dragons local leader Rezmir. 
He was probably killed by the lizardfolk chief Snapjaw, helped by a band of adventurers who were enemies of the Cult.
