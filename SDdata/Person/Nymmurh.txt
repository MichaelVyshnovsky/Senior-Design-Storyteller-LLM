'''Nymmurh''' was a [[bronze dragon]] summoned to the [[metallic dragon]]'s council to discuss of the menace of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and [[Tiamat]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]]. 

==Personality==
Nymmurh was granitic in his beliefs that humanity were better than metallic dragons. His thinking was simple: metallic dragons were created by [[Bahamut]] to do good and they must not turn away from that, but lesser species could freely choose to be good. He looked to the [[Harpers]] and the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] as two examples of his theory.

==History==
For a long time, Nymmurh protected the noble [[Waterdeep]] family of [[Silmerhelve]], to the point that he showed affection to members of the family, as exemplified by [[Dala Silmerhelve]]. He apparently chose the Silmerhelve family at random in [[1032 DR]] and over time Nymmurh manipulated the family's members into being kinder, gentler, and slower to act. Sometimes he appeared in front of Silmerhelve members, usually once a generation, as a long-dead ancestor returned from the grave (usually as the mad Lady [[Saerista Silmerhelve]]).

During a [[Dracorage]], Nymmurh accidentally teleported himself into the [[Plane of Mirrors]]. Since then, he became obsessed with the race known as the [[nerra]].

An adventuring band sent by the [[Council of Waterdeep]] may have convinced Nymmurh to ally with humanoid races in order to stop the Cult's plot.
