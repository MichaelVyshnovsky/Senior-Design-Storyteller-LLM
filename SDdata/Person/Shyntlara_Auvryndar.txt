'''Shyntlara Auvryndar''' was a [[drow]] [[vampire]] and [[matron mother]] of [[House Auvryndar]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], matron mother Shyntlara was a member of the city's ruling council. Being in the favor of [[Lolth]], she was able to maintain her position despite her rivals fearing she would create a vampire army. However, she found that she was only able to create vampires from drow that had failed the test of Lolth but had not yet been transformed into [[drider]]s. She held that secret close to her heart and revealed it to no one.
