Shyntlara Auvryndar was a drow vampire and matron mother of House Auvryndar.
In 1370 DR, matron mother Shyntlara was a member of the citys ruling council. Being in the favor of Lolth, she was able to maintain her position despite her rivals fearing she would create a vampire army. However, she found that she was only able to create vampires from drow that had failed the test of Lolth but had not yet been transformed into driders. She held that secret close to her heart and revealed it to no one.
