        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], after [[Elminster Aumar]] had foiled a Zhentarim plot to conquer [[High Dale]], [[Manshoon]] decided to send the young [[Avaerl]] to track and kill the Old Mage. In truth, the High Lord of the Zhentarim was skeptical of Avaerl's chances and sent also Zalarth Bloodbrow to follow Avaerl and intervene if needed. Zalarth gathered a team of [[Zhent]]s and started the mission.\n\nAvaerl found Elminster and [[Sharantyr]] at [[Spellgard]], always with Zalarth and his team following.\n\nHe managed to survive a meeting with Lady [[Saharel]] and spied upon the duel between the Old Mage and Avaerl, waiting for the right occasion but at last was killed by the timely arrival of the [[Harpers]] [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]] and [[Belkram Hardeth|Belkram]]."
