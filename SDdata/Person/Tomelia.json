        "mainbody": "'''Tomelia''' was the name given to a female [[gnoll]] [[archer]] who was mentally enslaved by a follower of [[the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, three gnolls had their will dominated by a [[True Soul]] cultist of a new fledgling religionâ€”[[the Absolute]]. [[Linsella]] used her [[psionics]], granted her via being infected by an [[illithid]] tadpole, to enslave and re-train the gnolls as her servants and cooks in the Moonrise Towers, which were the cult's base. She renamed her slave gnolls to Tomelia, [[Barnabus]], and [[Timothy]]. Linsella claimed that she'd quelled the gnolls' savage nature and showed them a \"gentler way.\" Tomelia was instructed to work in the kitchen, yet bloodthirstiness and rage still seethed underneath the painful mental domination.\n\nWhen the gnolls and their mistress encountered a group of the True Soul heroes of Baldur's Gate they may had been helped by severing Linsella's mental leash, leading to the cultist's swift death. Some said that the heroes could've dominated the gnolls themselves, while by other accounts, the three gnolls could've remained under the cult's control and perished in an assault by [[Harper]]s and the True Soul heroes on the Moonrise Towers."
