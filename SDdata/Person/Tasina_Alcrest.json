        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1472}}, soon after the end of the [[Wailing Death]] quarantine and the conclusion of the [[Neverwinter]]-[[Luskan]] war, Tasina made arrangements to travel aboard ''[[Midnight Rose]]'', departing from the gang-ridden [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of Neverwinter. During her last days in the Jewel of the North, Tasina stayed at the [[Golden Apple]] in the docks. When it was time to depart, Captain [[Allendry]] sent members of his crew: [[Nisar Zayid]] and [[Eater-of-Garm]]. However, trouble found her first. A group of thugs who were claiming to be Allendry's men were escorted to the priestess' chambers by [[Gilda]], Apple's older maid. The criminals were mercenaries hired by Tasina to guard her on the trip to Neverwinter and beyond. However, she had no [[coin]], and the men were ready for violence. Eater-of-Garm and Nisar arrived just in time to save the priestess and escort her to the ''Rose'' and her true goal.\n\nShe boarded the ''Midnight Rose'' as a passenger in order to stay close to a [[wizard]] who possessed a powerful [[statue]] [[artifact]] from the hot sands of [[Anauroch]] desired by Umberlee. When the ship was on the high seas, in order to acquire the strange artifact, Tasina summoned an army of [[sahuagin]] that slaughtered most of the crew and took the ship.\n\nShe then ventured into the mysterious sea-region of [[Fiddler's Green]]. There, Tasina planned to go to a submerged temple to her goddess and summon her in all her power. However, an adventurer, also a passenger of the ''Midnight Rose'', went in search of Tasina, having promised vengeance to the [[ghost]] of [[Allendry]], the ship's captain. At last, the adventurer defeated Tasina."
