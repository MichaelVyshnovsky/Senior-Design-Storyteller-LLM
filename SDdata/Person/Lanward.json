        "mainbody": "Patrol Captain Lanward was an officer in the Neverwinter Guard who lived in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nFollowing the Siege of Neverwinter in the , Lanward was stationed in the Tower District, which was occupied by Many-Arrows orcs. He was ordered to make sure no agents or sympathizers of Many-Arrows entered or left the district by the entrance near the Fallen Tower tavern. In practice, this meant preventing even half-orcs—like Johari who were long-time residents who wanted to help and adventurers recruited by Sergeant Alphonse Knox to serve the Guard—from entering the district for fear that they would join the cause of their orc cousins. While an accomplished half-orc adventurer recruit gave him pause for thought, Lanward tasked the adventurer with confirming that some Many-Arrows orcs were afflicted with spellscars, he said to convince the other guardsmen."
