'''Stormgale''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Stormgale led two plots to access the [[elemental node]] under the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. First, his right-hand agent [[Bloodwind]] tried to master a ritual involving many cultists who had infiltrated the monks. Afterward, Stormgale himself decided to kidnap some monks, planning to use them as sacrifice to open a ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Howling Void|6}}

==Rumors and Legends==
Around 1491 DR, an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster [[Perrywinkle Shin]] to find the missing monks ruined his plan and Stormgale was defeated.{{Cite adventurers league/The Howling Void|27-28}}
