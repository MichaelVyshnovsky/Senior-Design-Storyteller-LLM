Stormgale was a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
In 1491 DR, Stormgale led two plots to access the elemental node under the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. First, his right-hand agent Bloodwind tried to master a ritual involving many cultists who had infiltrated the monks. Afterward, Stormgale himself decided to kidnap some monks, planning to use them as sacrifice to open a gate to the Elemental Plane of Air.
Around 1491 DR, an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster Perrywinkle Shin to find the missing monks ruined his plan and Stormgale was defeated.
