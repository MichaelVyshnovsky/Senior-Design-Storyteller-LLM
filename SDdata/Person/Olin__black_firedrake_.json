        "mainbody": "'''Olin''' was a [[black firedrake]] who served the Ransar of [[Innarlith]] as a bodyguard in the mid–14{{th}} century DR.<ref name=LoL-p31\">",
        "History": "[[Marek Rymüt]] was a [[Thayan]] [[Red Wizard]] living in Innarlith in the mid–14{{th}} century DR acting as a secret agent on behalf of Thay while posing as a self-employed seller of [[magical item]]s and services. He began a project of creating black firedrakes in [[1361 DR]] using the [[black dragon]] [[great wyrm]] [[Insithryllax]] and female [[fire drake]]s to create the mutant creatures. \n\nOlin was one of the creatures that was created and he was kept within a pocket dimension under Marek's control that he called the [[Land of One Hundred and Thirteen]] along with other black firedrakes. On [[Eleint 8]] in [[1364 DR]], Marek polymorphed Olin into a human form as the first of many black firedrakes that he planned to polymorph in order to serve as an army for the person that Marek planned to install as the new Ransar of Innarlith. Marek made Olin the captain of the other black firedrakes.\n\nOn [[Highharvestide]], [[1365 DR]], Senator [[Salatis]] launched a coup in Innarlith to usurp Ransar [[Osorkon]] with help from Marek's black firedrakes. Captain Olin led his black firedrakes to besiege the [[Palace of Many Spires]] and fought a battle with Osorkon and his bodyguards in the Ransar's office. Olin and another black firedrake succeeded in killing Osorkon in the melee in their polymorphed human forms.<ref name=LoL-p25\">\n\nSalatis was then appointed as the new Ransar of Innarlith by the [[Senate of Innarlith]] and Olin served as his chief bodyguard. Salatis constructed a secret shrine to [[Shar]] in the Palace of Many Spires and then ordered the workmen who built the shrine to be killed after they had completed their work to preserve the secret. Olin carried out the Ransar's request by murdering them in the shrine with his axe at the conclusion of their labor.<ref name=LoL-p31\" />\n\nLater, Senator [[Pristoleph]] raised an army and invaded Innarlith in an attempt to install himself as the new Ransar of Innarlith. Olin and the other black firedrakes switched sides when Pristoleph had taken much of the city and laid siege to the palace. They murdered Salatis in his office and handed his body over to Pristoleph. Thereafter they served the new ransar. \n\nOlin and the other black firedrakes later successfully fought off an assassination attempt on Pristoleph by a [[maurezhi]] that had been sent by Marek Rymüt.",
        "Description": "In his polymorphed [[human]] form, Olin had brown skin and deep black eyes.",
        "Abilities": "He possessed an ability to transform between his black firedrake and human forms, given to him by [[Marek Rymüt]]. In either form, he possessed a breath weapon composed of both acid and flame. He was proficient with a long [[axe]] in his polymorphed human form and was able to understand [[Common]].<ref name=LoL-p31\" />"
