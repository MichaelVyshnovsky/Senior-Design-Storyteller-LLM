        "mainbody": "assiar was the undead master who turned Jander Sunstar into an elven vampire.\nThe master vampire was young looking with coppery red hair, pale skin, and large doe-like eyes. Cassiar preferred to wear fine clothing, such as leather boots, calfskin gloves, and linen shirts.\nCassiar was an evil creature who delighted in controlling and forcing others to do heinous acts against humanity, such as drinking the blood of an infant.\nIn 1072 DR, Cassiar was once one of the master vampires that plagued Daggerdale. For this, he was pursued by a band of adventurers, including Jander Sunstar and the cleric of Ilmater Gideon, among others. Cassiar was ambushed by the adventurers but escaped while killing most of the group.\nAfter Cassiar turned Gideon into an undead beast, the two vampires hunted down Jander Sunstar and transformed him into a vampire too."
