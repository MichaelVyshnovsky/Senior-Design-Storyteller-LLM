Yrberop was a myconid and leader of the Circle of Sporers in Neverlight Grove in the late 15 century DR.
Yrberop was easily seduced when Zuggtmoys will twisted most of the Circle circa 1486 DR. It began creating more and more myconid sprouts.
Because of Zuggtmoys influence, Yrberop always swayed to a music that only it could hear, and those in tune with the myconid could hear a faint echo. Yrberop was excited for Phylos plans to spread the will of Zuggtmoy throughout the Underdark. Due to its madness, Yrberop forgot all conversations after they ended.
