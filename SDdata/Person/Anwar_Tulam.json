        "mainbody": "Anwar Tulam was an elven corsair and captain of the pirate vessel the Reaver in 1367 DR.\nHis banner was a flying pair of crossed cutlasses.\nEasily the most-feared pirate haunting Suq Bay and even the Golden Gulf, Anwars bloodthirsty nature struck terror into the hearts of anyone sailing on the bay.\nAnwar and his crew attacked anyone they came into contact with on the open water. Fire was his preferred method of attack. He enjoyed using his liquid star projector on ships from the Admiralty of Huzuz.\nAs of 1367 DR, Anwar had a 5,000 dinar price tag attached to his head.\nAfter a brutal attack on the admirality, Anwars ship was left short of men and was believed to be heading for the Pearl Cities to recruit new crewmembers."
