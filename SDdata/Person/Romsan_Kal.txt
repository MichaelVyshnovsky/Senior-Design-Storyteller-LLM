Romsan Kal was a scarred innkeeper in Twilight Marsh near Phlan in 1489 DR.
Romsan was a jovial individual. He constantly changed the story of how he acquired his scars, from escaping from an illithid to a fight with a dragon. He knew all adventurers negotiating ploys and laughed if someone tried to use them on him.
Romsan was the Amnian manager of the Crossing Inn, the most famous inn near Trank River on the road to Phlan.
