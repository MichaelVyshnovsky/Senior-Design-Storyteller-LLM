'''Adris Colebriar''' was a male [[human]] [[fighter]] and a merchant of the [[Six Coffers Trading Coster]]. He managed a branch office in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].

Adris was a shrewd trader, and through him the Six Coffers dominated trade in the town. The store sold all standard, non-magical weapons, armor, and equipment, typically at higher-than-normal prices.
