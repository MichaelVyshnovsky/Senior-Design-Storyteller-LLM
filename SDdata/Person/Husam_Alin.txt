Husam Alin ran a large tour guide business from the Pilgrims District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Husam employed over 50 youths to guide pilgrims around the popular spots of the City of Delights. He charged 1 sp for a guided tour of the city. A carriage could be hired for 1 dinar to carry customers around.
The guides employed by Husam were called "Husams peacocks" because their abas were embroidered with red peacocks.
