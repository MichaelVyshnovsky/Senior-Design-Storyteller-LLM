'''Husam Alin''' ran a large tour guide business from the [[Pilgrims' District]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|59-61}}

==Activities==
Husam employed over 50 youths to guide pilgrims around the popular spots of the City of Delights. He charged 1 [[sp]] for a guided tour of the city. A carriage could be hired for 1 [[dinar]] to carry customers around.

The guides employed by Husam were called "Husam's peacocks" because their [[aba]]s were embroidered with red peacocks.
