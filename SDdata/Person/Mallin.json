The skull of Mallin took residence in a shattered tower in [[Myth Rhynn]], where he collected and studied [[magic]]. He sent visions via magic and spread rumors of great treasure to lure [[adventurer]]s to him, so he might steal their magic.<ref><ref>{{Cite dragon/206/Tashara of the Seven Skulls|76}}"
