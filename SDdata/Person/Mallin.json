        "mainbody": "Mallin was a lich and one of the lovers—and skulls—of Tashara of the Seven Skulls.\nAfter Azuth defeated Tashara, her seven skulls split apart, and went in many directions. The skull of Mallin took residence in a shattered tower in Myth Rhynn, where he collected and studied magic. He sent visions via magic and spread rumors of great treasure to lure adventurers to him, so he might steal their magic."
