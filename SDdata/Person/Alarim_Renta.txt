Alarim Renta was a half-orc leader of a human bandit gang that operated in the overland of Shadowdale in the year 1369 DR. His modus operandi was to intimidate passers-by to "donate" goods and gold for safe passage. His group was wary of increased patrols from Dagger Falls and fearful of Randal Morn and his Freedom Riders.
The bandit leader wore splint mail armor and wielded a bastard sword and shield. He was also in the possession of a +1 ring of protection.
