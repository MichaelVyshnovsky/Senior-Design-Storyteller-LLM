'''Caligope''' was a [[halfling]] [[priest]] of [[Brandobaris]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Caligope suffered from arachnophobia.

==History==
The greatest enemy in Caligope's life was an evil [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] by the name of [[Eli-Makar]]. Makar's wizard tower filled with abnormal varieties of spiders and the tower itself was surrounded by a hedge maze full of [[giant spider]]s. For over a year Caligope was so deathly afraid of its arachnid guardians that he refused to even look at the tower. Eventually, he sought to conquer his fear by crafting an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[club]] known as the ''[[Evil Spider Crusher of Doom]]''. Through use of the club he managed rob Eil-Makar blind and slaughter dozens of his spiders along the way.
