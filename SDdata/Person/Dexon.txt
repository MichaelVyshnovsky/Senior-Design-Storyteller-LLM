'''Dexon''' was a [[Vaasa]]n warrior that joined several of his countrymen on an expedition to the city of [[Evereska]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. There they reunited with [[Melegaunt Tanthul]], an ally of their ancestors who led them to a series of events that would reshape the face of [[Faerûn]] for decades to follow.

==Description==
He was a swarthy and burly man, His appearance (and disposition) was akin to that of a good-natured [[bear]].

During one of his battles while fighting along the elves of Evereska, Dexon's leg was badly injured, withered to the point where it could hardly bear his weight.

==Personality==
Dexon was both a steadfast warrior as well as a kind and caring man. While he and his men were always ready for battle, Dexon often found himself a bit flummoxed when confronted with matters of love.

==Possessions==
Like his fellow Vaasans that made the expedition to the [[Sharn Wall]] beneath Evereska, Dexon was the proud owner of a ''[[darksword]]''. His blade had the unique quirk of "talking in its sleep", presumably when sheathed.

==Relationships==
The burly Vaasan warrior developed a loving and passionate romance with one of his party's elven hosts, [[Keya Nihmedu]]. After a few short months together they fell in love, and Dexon became very protective of Keya, even if he had trouble expressing himself.

==History==
Dexon joined the expedition from [[Vaasa]] to Evereska in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. After traveling to [[Evereska]] in the [[Greycloak Hills]], Dexon chose to to remain within the [[elven]] city. During his travels he developed feelings for Keya Nihmedu of the [[Vale Guard]]. 

In mid–[[Mirtul]] of that year, the [[archmage]] [[Khelben Arunsun]] finally broke through the [[phaerimm]]-led siege of Evereska and began coordinating the city's defense with the [[Hill Elders]]. Dexon and his men served as the [[Blackstaff]]'s personal escorts for a time. When the time came that Khelben's company leave to fight the phaerimm, Dexon was saddened to part ways from Keya.

The pair reunited in battle when the phaerimm attacked the [[Vine Vale]] on [[Mirtul 20]]. During the fighting, Keya made use of Dexon's ''darksword'' and felt no ill effects—a sensation of cold that left the blade unwieldable after a short time—and realized they had been bonded as family. Keya was expectant with Dexon's child. As Dexon suffered a grievous wound shortly thereafter,
