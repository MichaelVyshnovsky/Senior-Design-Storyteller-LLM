'''Princeps Kovik''' was a [[chain devil]] warlord in [[Avernus]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Although particularly cruel, Kovik was a capable leader who had gained the trust of its subordinates.

==Possessions==
The Princeps rode a [[Devil's Ride]] [[infernal war machine]].

==History==
Kovik once commanded the [[8th Infantry Legion]] of the Nine Hells, nicknamed "Terror Incarnate". After a crushing defeat in battle against the [[demon lord]] [[Kostchtchie]] on the banks of the [[Styx]], Kovik blamed his superiors. The chain devil commander gathered the surviving members of the 8th Legion and renounced the infernal hierarchy, forming the marauder gang known as the [[Eighth Remnant]].

==Activities==
Kovik's ultimate goal was to gather enough military strength to drive the [[demon]]s out of Avernus forever. Many disenfranchised devils sympathized with this goal, and so flocked to join the Eighth Remnant.
