Henry Coldwater was the owner of the Breakneck Ski Resort in the Ten Towns of the Northwest Faer√ªn in the late 14 century DR.
By the late 14 century DR, Henry Coldwater was the man who ran the Breakneck Resort. Once day a hin smuggler from the city of Luskan arrived to the Ten Towns in search of shelter. Henry Coldwater saw potential and initiative in the newcomer. However, Breakneck Resort proved its name to the amateur skier halfling. Only the most proficient skiers and orcs returned from the slopes unharmed. A short time later, Henry Coldwater hosted a eulogy for the dearly departed Jaccob the halfling.
