Kai Hua Liu was a bushi in Shou Lung in the midâ€“14 century DR. She was a member of the Liu Clan.
Going back many generations, the Liu Clan had a feud with the powerful Feng Su clan of Cham Fau. Circa 1357 DR, Kai was tasked with protecting Liu ships and spying upon Feng Su agents. She believed them to be consorting with pirates of the Hungtse River and would do anything to have proof of that.
