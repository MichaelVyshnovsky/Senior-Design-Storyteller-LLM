'''Yeslick''' was a [[dwarven]] [[priest]] of [[Clan Orothiar]] that hailed from the [[Cloak Wood mine|mines]] beneath the [[Cloak Wood]] forest. He venerated [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] as his patron deity.

{{Quote|We do good. 'Tis as my clan was, long ago.|Yeslick}}

==Personality==
Yeslick was a good-natured and laid back dwarf. He was not a proponent of violence and felt it could only solve the most basic of life's problems.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1243}}, the Orothiar dwarves dug too deep within their subterranean home. They opened a passageway into an underground river that flooded the mines and killed nearly all of the clan.

Having survived the incident with few others, Yeslick left his ancestral home and made for the eastern realm of [[Sembia]] in the hopes of starting anew. He worked as a smith and befriended one of his clients, [[Richtar]] of the [[Iron Throne]], who used the alias of Rieltar Anchev.

Yeslick wound up sharing the history of his clan with his new "friend", who in turn used the information against the trusting priest. "Rieltar" tortured Yeslick for the exact location of his clan's mine, imprisoned him,

Yeslick was still imprisoned within the Cloak Wood mines as of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. He sought to flood the mine again, and rid his old home from the menace of the Iron Throne.
