'''Bernadette''' was an [[abjurer]] and a member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] who was imprisoned by the [[barber]] [[Jooge Nopsmoth]] in [[Silverymoon]].{{Timescale}}

==Description==
Bernadette had light skin and brown hair, and wore spectacles. She was clad in a blue robe and blue pointy hat.

==Abilities==
Although able to cast lesser spells at will, Bernadette relied on her spellbook for most of her magical arsenal.

==History==
While getting her hair curled by Jooge Nopsmoth, Bernadette was kidnapped by the barber and placed in an oubliette beneath Jooge's shop. Under duress, she helped Jooge construct the ''[[Prismatic Coloring Machine]]'', a device that used extradimensional energies to color hair and cause a wide range of curious side effects.
