'''Marantine Delcastle''' was a noble of [[Delcastle|House Delcastle]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, following the request of her son [[Arclath Delcastle]], Marantine agreed to house [[Amarune Whitewave]] and [[Elminster Aumar]]'s party in her house for a time. She also told them about the [[Imprisoners]] and the creation of the [[blueflame ghost]]s, which she knew of thanks to her family dealings with the [[church of Mystra]].

That year, in order to lure out Elminster after the matter of [[Castle Irlingstar]], [[Manshoon]] sent a contingent of his [[death tyrant]]s and several of his magically dominated nobles to attack [[Delcastle Mansion]]. In the fighting, Lady Marantine was fatally injured. She died soon after seeing her son a final time.{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|4836}}

==Relationships==
Arclath had a frosty relationship with his mother, who seemed more interested in being pleasured by young men than the family business.
