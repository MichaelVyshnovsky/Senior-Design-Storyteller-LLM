        "History": "After [[the Descent]] briefly dragged Elturel down to the [[Nine Hells]] in the{{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city's tiefling population was promptly blamed and exiled from the city. The community traveled west from the city towards Baldur's Gate, but was forced to stop for a time at the [[Emerald Grove]] due to increased goblin attacks along the [[Risen Road]].\n\nUnder the supervision of the stalwart [[Asharak]], tiefling children like Ide were given training with small blades so that they could defend themselves against goblins if the need ever arose. While some other children were more hesitant, Ide was confident in his ability to face down a [[goblinoid]] attack."
