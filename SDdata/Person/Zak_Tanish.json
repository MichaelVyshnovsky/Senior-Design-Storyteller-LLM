        "mainbody": "Zak Tanish was the harbormaster of Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nZak proved to be an able harbormaster and administrator. He possessed an uncanny ability to resist bribes and threats from various powers within Zhentil Keep. Unbeknownst to all, Zak was an agent for the Zhentarim who reported the names of the citys corrupt lords, and other enemies of the city, who attempted to bribe him directly to Lord Manshoon.\nBefore his time as harbormaster, Zak served as a soldier in the Zhentilar where he achieved the rank of captain. An injury suffered during a battle in YÃ»lash left him lame in one leg and prompted his retirement from the Zhentilar."
