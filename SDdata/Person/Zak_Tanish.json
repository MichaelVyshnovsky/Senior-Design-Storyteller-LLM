        "mainbody": "'''Zak Tanish''' was the harbormaster of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Zak proved to be an able harbormaster and administrator. He possessed an uncanny ability to resist bribes and threats from various powers within Zhentil Keep. Unbeknownst to all, Zak was an agent for the [[Zhentarim]] who reported the names of the city's corrupt lords, and other enemies of the city, who attempted to bribe him directly to Lord [[Manshoon]].",
        "History": "Before his time as harbormaster, Zak served as a soldier in the [[Zhentilar]] where he achieved the rank of captain. An injury suffered during a battle in [[YÃ»lash]] left him lame in one leg and prompted his retirement from the Zhentilar."
