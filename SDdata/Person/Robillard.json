        "mainbody": "'''Robillard''' was a [[wizard]] of the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a close ally of Captain [[Deudermont]] who served as the second-in-command on Deudermont's vessel, the ''[[Sea Sprite]]''. He was a former member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].",
        "History": "He aided Deudermont after an assassination attempt in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, an act that helped save the life of [[Wulfgar]], the accused killer. Had Deudermont not woken, Wulfgar would have been falsely executed for the alleged assassination attempt, a crime that Deudermont confirmed he did not commit.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, Robillard single-handedly defeated [[Arklem Greeth]], a [[lich]] and the former Archmage Arcane of the Arcane Brotherhood. This battle, however, pulled the wizard from his captain's side, allowing High Captain [[Kensidan]] of [[Luskan]] to bait and kill Captain Deudermont.<ref>"
