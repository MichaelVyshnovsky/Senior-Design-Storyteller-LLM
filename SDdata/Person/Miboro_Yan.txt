'''Miboro Yan''' ({{Pronounce|mee|BOW|row|_|YAHN|refs = {{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|3}}}}) was the proprietor of [[Holdup|The Holdup]], a popular tavern in [[Port Nyanzaru]]'s [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Miboro was well-respected and much beloved among the [[adventurer]]s who passed through Port Nyanzaru and the people of the Old City alike.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|33}} Owing to her perceived influence, the [[Zhentarim]] became interested in arranging to have Miboro owe them a favor.

==History==
Shortly after the end of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Miboro was captured by [[undead]] servants of the [[necromancer]] [[Jaru Tasca]]{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|4}} By the following evening, an alliance of foreign adventuring factions had assembled a team to rescue her. They were led by [[Branzen]] (a [[Tyrran]] [[priest]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]) and included [[Dunlo]] (a [[dwarf]] [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]]), [[Grunk]] (a Zhentarim [[orc]] [[spy]]), [[Lily (elf)|Lily]] (a Zhentarim [[elf]] [[berserker]]), [[Mandolin (tabaxi)|Mandolin]] (a [[tabaxi]] [[bard]] and [[Harper]]), and [[Mercer]] (a [[human]] [[knight]] in service of the [[Lords' Alliance]]).{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|6}}

Unfortunately, this rescue operation was all according to Jaru Tasca's plan, whose real goal in kidnapping Miboro was to lure adventurers to her lair in the catacombs beneath the [[Beggars' Palaces|Old City ziggurats]] in order to transform them into undead servants to lead the undead forces of her master, [[Zuccass]]. By the very next day, Jaru sent an anonymous message to the [[Port_Nyanzaru/Old_City#Government|beggar prince]] [[Pock-Marked Po]] encouraging him to assemble yet more adventurers to send to rescue Miboro. After checking with his contacts in the various factions, Po interrogated her messenger&mdash;the [[albino dwarf]] [[Favin Kreeger]]&mdash;before hiring a party to seek her out.

In the meantime, Jaru Tasca kept Miboro chained in her lair as bait while she began turning the first group of adventurers into undead.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|11}}{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|5}}
