After [[Fender Stouthammer]], his dwarf companion, was overwhelmed by [[trolls]], Bonnerbas was the first to realise he was dead. Bonnerbas himself was killed soon after by [[Proffit]] during the ensuing battle.\n\nAfter the dwarves and refugees of Nesmé had escaped from the trolls, the dwarves huddled together, and offered prayers to [[Moradin]] for the souls of Bonnerbas.",
