        "mainbody": "Thendric was a male human fighter and a temple guard at the new Temple of Mystra in Wheloon, Cormyr.\nThendric stood guard in the outer courtyard of the temple, and had a bunk in the guard post outside.\nIn early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Thendric was questioned by adventurers investigating the temple.Strangely, the module says \"If the PCs ask about Thendricâ€™s claims (see below)\", but no entry is given for Thendric (presumably missing in error), so his importance and these claims are unknown. In response, Shan Thar discusses the temple taking in prisoners from the Wheloon Jail.\nThe temple guards wielded longbow and longsword, and wore scale mail armor."
