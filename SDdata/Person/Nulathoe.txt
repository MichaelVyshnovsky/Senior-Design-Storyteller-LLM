'''Nulathoe''' was a [[necromancer]],{{Cite dragon/62/Pages from the Mages|17}}

==Magic==
Most famously, he created the [[necromancy|necromantic]] spell known as ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]'',{{Cite dragon/32/Dragon's Bestiary|39}} He was also credited with inventing the spells ''[[Nulathoe's concussive demise]]'', ''[[Nulathoe's death ward]]'', and ''[[Nulathoe's undead army]]''. Although he was a powerful necromancer, Nulathoe's spells were generally too crude to aid in the preservation of complex organs.

Nulathoe authored many necromantic tomes,{{Cite dragon/82/Spells between the covers|58}}

==History==
Nulathoe had two apprentices, one of whom was the famous wizard and spell inventor Nchaser. After Nulathoe's death, these two apprentices carried on his legacy by proliferating his most famous spell: ''Nulathoe's ninemen''.

==Rumors & Legends==
Nulathoe was sometimes mentioned alongside infamous [[lich]]es like [[Acererak]] and [[Vecna]] as a testament to the corruptive nature of necromancy.{{Cite dragon/403/Academies of Magic|11}}
