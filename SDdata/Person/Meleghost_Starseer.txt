Meleghost Starseer was the high priest of the House of Wonder, the temple to Mystra in Waterdeep, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Meleghost was a cruel but polite individual. He was fiercely devoted to Mystra. Meleghost professed that he respected all faithful but his dealings with the Red Magic Enclave alienated many worshipers.
Meleghost had a good relationship with Maaril and the leaders of Eltorchul family, and troubled relations with Khelben Arunsun and the members of the Wands clan. He maintained a cold but polite relationship with Naneatha Suaril but was nearly hostile to Xale of the Starry Glen of the Order of the Blue Moon. Despite the advice of his allies in the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, he started dealings with members of the Red Magic Enclave.
