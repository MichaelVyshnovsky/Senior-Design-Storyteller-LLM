'''Meleghost Starseer''' was the high priest of the [[House of Wonder]], the temple to [[Mystra]] in [[Waterdeep]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Meleghost was a cruel but polite individual. He was fiercely devoted to Mystra. Meleghost professed that he respected all faithful but his dealings with the [[Red Magic Enclave]] alienated many worshipers.

==Relationship==
Meleghost had a good relationship with [[Maaril]] and the leaders of [[Eltorchul]] family, and troubled relations with [[Khelben Arunsun]] and the members of the [[Wands]] clan. He maintained a cold but polite relationship with [[Naneatha Suaril]] but was nearly hostile to [[Xale of the Starry Glen]] of the [[Order of the Blue Moon]]. Despite the advice of his allies in the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]], he started dealings with [[Red wizard|members of the Red Magic Enclave]].
