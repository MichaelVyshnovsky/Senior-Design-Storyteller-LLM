        "mainbody": "'''Tomphael Arkenrret''' was a mature adult [[drow-dragon]] (''draa'zekyl''), who held the tile of Patron Father of [[Eryndlyn]]Â among the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}} After the [[Silence of Lolth]], he became the direct superior of [[Nimor Imphraezl]].",
        "Description": "In his [[drow]] form, his appearance was that of a slender drow in [[wizard]] robes, which looked rakish. In his [[dragon]]-form, he was a mature adult [[shadow dragon]].",
        "Personality": "He was first and foremost a cautious pragmatist. He preferred steadily pooling his strength, so he could conduct decisive strikes at the right opportunity, over taking risky actions. In the eyes of Nimor Imphraezl, Tomphael's cautiousness bordered on cowardice, and the older dragon was aware of the young one's evaluation of him.",
        "History": "Tomphael was the Patron Father of the major fosterage in Eryndlyn,{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}} Under him, the Jaezred Chaulssin managed to bring the drow of the [[church of Vhaeraun]] and those from [[Ghaunadaur]]'s under a single banner during the [[Silence of Lolth]], so they were able to destroy the power of [[Lolth]] in their city. They succeeded.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|4}}\n\nIn the post-[[Spellplague]] era, the major fosterage in Eryndlyn was still in existence,",
        "Relationship": "As mentioned above, he was the head of the fosterage in Eryndlyn.\n\nAfter his failure at subduing [[Menzoberranzan]], Nimor Imphraezl got demoted and assigned as Tomphael's direct subordinate. Tomphael became something of a mentor-figure to the young [[assassin]]. Through a discussion with Tomphael, Nimor understood the value of steady work and to move at full strength when the opportunity presented itself. Tomphael bolstered the demoted assassin's confidence by ensuring that new opportunities would arise and that re-promotion wasn't barred to him, when he learned to act properly on an opportunity.",
        "Abilities": "Tomphael was a mature adult [[drow-dragon]].\n\nLike the other drow-dragons, he trained himself in additional skills instead of fully relying on his inborn powers. In his case, he trained in the skills of an [[assassin]] and those of a [[wizard]].\n\nWhile he an assassin by trade and training, his skill at it fulfilled only the bare minimum needed to meet the requirements to be a member of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]].\n\nHis true strength lay with his magic. While he had impressive magical skill and power as a wizard, what was interesting about him wasn't the strength but the variety of arcane power he wielded. He was primarily a wizard,",
        "Residence": "Like any other Patron Father, he owned a residence in his fosterage in [[Eryndlyn]],{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|2}}"
