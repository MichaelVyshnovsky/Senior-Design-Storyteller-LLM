        "mainbody": "rcaheart was the village champion of the Ice Hunters that dwelled on the isle of Oyaviggaton circa the 1480s DR.\nAt times, the Ice Hunters chieftain Barking Seal would propose duels between Orcaheart and wandering outlands that stepped upon their island home. If Orcaheart won, the outsiders would have to offer up some of their finer weapons, especially those made of steel. If he lost, his opponent and their companions were welcome to the village, and offered food and shelter. Orcaheart was often offered assistance in the form of healing magic but the village shaman Bonecarver."
