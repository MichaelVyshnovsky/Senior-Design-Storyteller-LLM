        "History": "Daern became a devoted companion of [[Flaergon]] of [[Glister]], a priest of [[Ilmater]] who dedicated himself to assisting miners and caravan-workers in the frozen north of the [[Moonsea]] lands. Flaergon was also the bearer of the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', one of holiest books of the Ilmatari faith. After Flaergon died of a fall in a chasm near [[Whitehorn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1299}}, Daern took the ''Tome of Torment'' across all of Faer√ªn back to the [[House of the Broken God]] temple in [[Keltar]], [[Calimshan]].\n\nDaern presented the ''Tome'' to the High Mistress of Worthy Suffering, [[Althea|Althea the Abased]]. Daern's devotion so moved Althea that she named him an honorary Brother of the temple. Daern became Althea's personal bodyguard, but his duties consisted largely of carrying the frail, crippled priestess around.\n\nAlthea the Abased finally passed on in the {{YearlinkName|1341}}, and Daern mourned her passing. He was appointed to the new role as Guardian of the Tome, defending the artifact he'd once traveled so far to deliver. Unfortunately, within a year, Daern was murdered one night by a semi-monstrous man&mdash;Althea's predecessor, [[Bloirt Waelarn]]&mdash;who stole the ''Tome'' and escaped.\n\nEven as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Vast Emptiness of Grace|8}}"
