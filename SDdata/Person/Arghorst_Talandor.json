        "mainbody": "'''Arghorst Talandor''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|345}} to {{yearlink|404}}. He was beloved by a wide variety of wizards.",
        "Appearance": "He was described as impressive and well-spoken.",
        "Personality": "He was fond of teaching to the point that he praised the technique of the student that slew him even as he was doing it.",
        "Possessions": "The first of the ''[[Talandor's helm]]s'' were created by Arghorst.",
        "Activities": "During his tenure, Arghorst Talandor freely gave spells to every mage he met, mediated disputes between them, started many careers, and often aided in spell creation. He was also known to have a recipe for ''[[potion of longevity]]'' which he both used and sold to nonwizards.",
        "History": "He defeated the previous [[Magister]], [[Phambra Chalyphar]], by goading her into a rage, being already prepared to defeat her.\n\nAs the Magister, he became largely beloved by being indiscriminately helpful to all wizards he came across. His end came ultimately when one of his students took advantage of his good will by running him low on spells, and then challenging him to a duel on the spot.\n\nAfter his death, he became one of [[Mystra]]'s most favored [[shadowstaff|shadowstaves]]. He was occassionally allowed to return to flesh and blood to help a mage in need of insight, if they prayed to Mystra."
