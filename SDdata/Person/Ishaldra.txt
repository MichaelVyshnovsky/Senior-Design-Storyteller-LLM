'''Ishaldra''' was a [[dryad]] princess and a powerful [[fey]] of [[Kryptgarden Forest]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Activities==
She advised her companion prince [[Witchthorn]], balancing his evil inclinations with her good nature.

==History== 
In 1489 DR, the arrival of [[Claugiyliamatar]] corrupted Ishaldra and her [[treant]] bodyguard. The corruption, coming in the form of poisoned waters, paralyzed Ishaldra and drove her treant mad. Eventually, an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones freed them from corruption and in exchange they were directed to King Witchthorn.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|24-25}}
