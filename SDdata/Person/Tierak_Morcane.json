        "mainbody": "Tierak Morcane was a female drow priestess of Lolth and perhaps the sole surviving priestess from House Morcane after the Silence of Lolth.\nEver-scowling, Tierak Morcane was nevertheless a striking female and like many priestesses of Lolth, she had an almost palpable aura of authority about her.\nTierak typically wore a shirt of fine mithral chain and a spider-shaped dagger at her belt.\nAt the time of the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, Tierak was one of the many priestesses from House Morcane but she fled Szith Morcane when Kiaransaleean cultists overthrew the rulers of the settlement on Marpenoth 12th. After the fall of her House, Tierak found her way into the Dordrien crypts above Szith Morcane, along with a pair of skilled bodyguards and a Spellguard that were still loyal to her. Here they planned their reprisal against the followers of the White Banshee.\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryWorshipers of Lolth\nCategoryInhabitants of Dordrien\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dagger Hills\nCategoryInhabitants of Daggerdale\nCategoryInhabitants of the Dalelands\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Szith Morcane\nCategoryInhabitants of the Deep Wastes\nCategoryInhabitants of the Upperdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryMembers of House Morcane\nCategoryClerics of Lolth\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nj8bys35kvwfyywayghqpzl0107ydjhs"
