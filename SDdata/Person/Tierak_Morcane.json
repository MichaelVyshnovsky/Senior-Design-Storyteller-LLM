        "mainbody": "'''Tierak Morcane''' was a female [[drow]] [[priestess]] of [[Lolth]] and perhaps the sole surviving priestess from [[House Morcane]] after the [[Silence of Lolth]].",
        "Description": "Ever-scowling, Tierak Morcane was nevertheless a striking female and like many priestesses of Lolth, she had an almost palpable aura of authority about her.",
        "Possessions": "Tierak typically wore a shirt of fine [[mithral]] [[chain shirt|chain]] and a spider-shaped [[dagger]] at her belt.",
        "History": "At the time of the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], Tierak was one of the many priestesses from [[House Morcane]] but she fled [[Szith Morcane]] when [[Kiaransalee|Kiaransaleean]] cultists overthrew the rulers of the settlement on [[Marpenoth]] 12th. After the fall of her House, Tierak found her way into the [[Dordrien|Dordrien crypts]] above Szith Morcane, along with a pair of skilled bodyguards and a [[Spellguard]] that were still loyal to her. Here they planned their reprisal against the followers of the White Banshee.",
