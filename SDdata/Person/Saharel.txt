Lady Saharel was formerly an archmage of ancient Netheril and later ruler of Saharelgard, better known as Spellgard, a ruined castle complex on the western edge of the former Anauroch desert.
At some point, presumably after the fall of Netheril (), Lady Saharel became an archlich. Lady Saharel continued to watch over Spellgard as an archlich until 1358 DR, when she sacrificed herself in order to destroy the wizard Manshoon and defend Elminster of Shadowdale.
As of 1479 DR, Lady Saharel continued to exist beyond death as a kind of prophetic spirit or ghost. On rare occasions when she appeared within the ruins of Spellgard, she answered questions posed by any nearby mortals. It was said that no query was off limits. At times, in order to get Saharel to divulge information a price was required. This could take the form of repairing part of Spellgard.
It was thought that the only way to lay Lady Saharels ghost to rest was to destroy Manshoon and all of his clones.
Lady Saharel, once a companion and lover of Elminster of Shadowdale, was known to view the Harpers with favor and the Zhentarim with hostility.
