        "mainbody": "'''Leevi''' was one of the hunters of the [[Wandering Village]] who traveled [[Icewind Dale]] between the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Leevi traveled with his small community of hunters and gatherers in the harsh northern lands. Leevi had a friendly personality and welcomed business with even a [[drow]] merchant known as [[Nym (Icewind Dale)|Nym]]. The hunter was respectful of [[Tahvo]] the Huntmaster, his senior and an expert on the local tundra.\n\nLeevi found companionship in the arms of [[Carita]], a local villager woman, who was married to [[Kyosti]], one of the Wandering Village's hunters. The two lovers decided to murder Carita's husband, and she lured him away from the village, where they ended Kyosti's life.\n\nWhen a group of adventurers from [[Targos]] arrived at the village, they investigated the hunter's disappearance, discovering the truth about the murder. Carita and Leevi fled the Wandering Village. Soon after, the couple came across the Beastlord [[Harshom]] of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], who was in pursuit of the adventurers. The pair eagerly informed the Beastlord of the heroes' plans and whereabouts. As a reward, both were fed to Harshom's four fierce war-[[bear]]s."
