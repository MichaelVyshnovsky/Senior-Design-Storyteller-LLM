'''Vhalak''' was a [[doppelganger]] in the employ of [[Nezznar]], the Black Spider.

==Description==
A servant of the Black Spider, Vhalak often took the form of a [[drow]] male, who supervised others.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} he supervised the [[bugbear]]s that were clearing the floor of a collapsed cavern in the north of [[Wave Echo Cave]]. If a fight broke out between those he was supervising, he planned to fight on their behalf. However, if he was sorely outnumbered, he would attempt to warn the Black Spider of the intruders.
