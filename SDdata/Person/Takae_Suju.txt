'''Takae Suju''' was a monk in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Suju was the military instructor at [[Uwaji]] and a close collaborator of [[Baiyosho Degi]]. Takae, however, advocated for a more proactive role for the [[samurai]] in the country's government, but this idea did not please the [[shogunate]] and he was reassigned to the isle of [[Huyusha]] to teach the prisoners at [[Ibhei]].

Suju continued his studies on government reform and wrote many unpublished books about it.
