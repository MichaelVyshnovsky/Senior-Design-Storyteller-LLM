Argul Marammas was a wizard who lived in Suzail in 1367 DR.
In Arguls view, most people, warriors especially, were little more than lumbering fools who destroyed everything they could get their hands on. Arguls condescending attitude kept many mages from his company.
Argul spent most of his time researching exotics planes of existence and spells involving personal protection. In order to fund his research, and his expensive taste in exotic dining, Argul sold scrolls containing one to three spells. These scrolls sold for 5,000 gp per spell.
Eager to learn more about the planes, Argul was always interested in speaking with planar travelers.
