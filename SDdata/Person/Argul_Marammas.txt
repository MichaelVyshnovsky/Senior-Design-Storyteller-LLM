'''Argul Marammas''' was a [[wizard]] who lived in [[Suzail]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Personality==
In Argul's view, most people, [[warrior]]s especially, were little more than lumbering fools who destroyed everything they could get their hands on. Argul's condescending attitude kept many [[mage]]s from his company.

==Activities==
Argul spent most of his time researching exotics [[planes of existence]] and [[spell]]s involving personal protection. In order to fund his research, and his expensive taste in exotic dining, Argul sold scrolls containing one to three spells. These scrolls sold for 5,000 [[gp]] per spell.

==Rumors and Legends==
Eager to learn more about the planes, Argul was always interested in speaking with planar travelers.
