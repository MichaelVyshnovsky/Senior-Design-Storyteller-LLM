        "mainbody": "Zensil of Westgate was an enchanter pirate who sailed on the Maelstrom in the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThe wizard was known as a soft spoken man.\nZensil enjoyed bringing creatures of the sea into battles to help his shipmates, such as crocodiles, giant crabs, and on one occasion a giant sea snake. At the conclusion of each fight, Zensil would release his monstrous \"allies\" back into the deep.\nAround 1359 DR, Zensil was the lieutenant and ally of Vurgrom the Mighty and the key to his success it was Zensil who charmed small schools of vicious sea-creatures to aid Vurgrom in his raids."
