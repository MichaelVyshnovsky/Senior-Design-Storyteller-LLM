        "mainbody": "Grumbelham Goldhand was one of the innkeepers of the Wildlands Rest, a wayside inn in the Silver Marches.\nGumbelhams adventuring and business partner was Irvag the Bear. Both were enterprising souls.\nIn 1371 DR, the two old adventurers built and founded the Wildlands Rest. Despite their age, they were able to repel multiple orc attacks on their business. They continually expanded the location, adding additions to the building and upgrading furnishings."
