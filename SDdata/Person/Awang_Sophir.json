        "History": "Awang Sophir was a mysterious monk who arrived in [[Suijeng]] with four students from Petan to participate in the Komite. He was a master of the mystical style of [[Wikipedia:silat|silat]] but knew nothing about [[Chu' Yuan]]. Awang Sophir managed to finish among the tournament's finalists. \n\nIn one of the final rounds of the tournament, he competed against an adventurer but Awang was disqualified for his use of a magical lucky charm. Awang promised vengeance against the adventurer.\n\nLater, Awang tricked some villagers into believing that his adventurer opponent and their companions were [[demon]]s and sent them to kill them, but with no success.\n\nSoon after, Awang took control of the leaderless [[taring]] village of [[Gigit]] in [[Kutuk Valley]]. He ruled there until his adventurer opponent and their companions and/or the previous [[vampire]] ruler [[Xi-Chu]] came to Gigit. Awang quickly escaped using his ''ring of teleportation'' to avoid a confrontation.\n\nFollowing again his adventurer opponent and their companions, Awang was attacked by [[tiger]]s and injured. However, he was nursed back to health by a barbarian tribe. Again he tricked the barbarians into believing that his adventurer opponent and their companions were demons and led them to [[Tempat Larang]] to have vengeance.\n\nAt Tempat Larang, he attacked the adventurers and [[Osari Minhiro]] just before they entered the [[demiplane]] of [[Qui]] but Awang was defeated. Nevertheless, he followed his enemies into the demiplane.\n\nIn Qui, however, Awang couldn't manage to find the exit and at last was killed and eaten by a pack of [[jackal]]s."
