He held the title of "Master Worker" within the guild and worked out of the [[League Office]]â€“their headquarters on [[Wall Way]] in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]]. Felthauvin held the position of guildmaster for most of his life, thanks in part to his expert skill at his chosen craft and his ability to train others.
