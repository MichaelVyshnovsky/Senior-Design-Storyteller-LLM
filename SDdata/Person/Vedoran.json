He utilized [[Beshaba|Beshaba's]] temple for healing and schemed with [[Traedis]], Beshaba's [[cleric|priest]], to start an uprising in the city.{{Cite digital book/Unbroken Chain|3996}}\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], [[Uwan]] appointed Vedoran the leader of an expedition to investigate the disappearance of a scouting party lead by the [[wizard|witch]] [[Ilvani]].  He was accompanied by several young Shadar-kai warriors including [[Ashok]], who had been found near death in the Shadowfell several months previous.{{Cite digital book/Unbroken Chain|2481}}\n\nThe group found the Shadar-kai enclave in which Ilvani was held prisoner and during the rescue mission, Vedoran correctly guessed that the enclave belonged to Ashok's clan.  Vedoran took the information to Traedis who encouraged him to frame Ashok as a traitor to Ikemmu.  Vedoran took an oath to Beshaba with the intent of starting a revolt in Ikemmu.  Vedoran later had a heated argument with Tempus' high priest [[Natan]] and killed the cleric.  Vedoran denounced Ashok as a traitor and murderer to Uwan and Uwan found Ashok guilty and sentenced him to imprionment for ten days, a sentence that could kill a Shadar-Kai who must have constant stimulus to avoid fading to oblivion.{{Cite digital book/Unbroken Chain}}\n\nVedoran went to Ashok's cell with the intention of killing him but was surprised by Uwan.  The two fought and Vedoran seriously injured Uwan.  However, Ashok was able to kill Vedoran.{{Cite digital book/Unbroken Chain|5393}}"
