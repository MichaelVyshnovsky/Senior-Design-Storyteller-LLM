'''Salazon''' was a lesser [[wizard]] that worked with the [[Zhentarim]] that operated a [[Zhentarim hideout (Risen Road)|hidden cavern]] beneath a stretch of the [[Risen Road]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|'Little serpent, long shadow.' Don't want to die. 'Little serpent, long shadow.' Just say it!|Salazon's thoughts when someone approached the Zhentarim hideout.}}

==Personality==
He was a bit of a nervous fellow that thoroughly preferred not being dead.

==History==
When the Zhent leader Zarys ordered her group to abandon and eventually destroy their hideout beneath [[Waukeen's Rest]], Salazon was given the unenviable position of carrying out their first line of defense. If anyone came into the warehouse behind the inn, without knowing the correct passphrase, Salazon would ignite a series of explosive barrels killing the intruders and himself before they could gain entry.
