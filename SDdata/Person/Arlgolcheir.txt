Arlgolcheir was a demon lord trapped in The Wells of Darkness.
All that was left of Arlgolcheir was a pile of rotting, oozing flesh that continuously seeped from his well of darkness as the Abyss tried to resurrect him. Abyssal ghouls and chasmes fed upon this flesh, and if it were not for their activity Arlgolcheir would indeed eventually regenerate.
Anyone who looked into the perfectly still pool of inky blackness would perceive what was likely Arlgolcheirs living form a scaly, corpulent person with a three-pronged horn growing from the end of an elongated snout. However, the image also appeared pale and lifeless, and was unresponsive.
Arlgolcheir once made a pact with the demon lord Ahazu in for power, pledging his body and essence if he ever died on another plane. He rose quickly in power after that, soon becoming a minor demon lord.
However, Laeral Silverhand found an amulet tied to him and, after calling Khelben Arunsun and Alduth of Neverwinter by sending, the two mages gemjumped to her by way of a pair of rogue stones she was carrying, and all three were ready to fight when Arlgolcheir appeared. He was subsequently destroyed.
Arlgolcheir was then drawn to and trapped in a well of darkness as the second part of his foolish pact came into effect.
