        "mainbody": "'''Phintarn''', nicknamed '''\"Redblade\"''', was the lord of the town of [[Llorkh]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the 1350s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Phintarn was the last of the old lords of Llorkh. These were a succession of [[human]] rulers, often retired miners or warriors who'd earned the respect of the community who, it was said, would never have tolerated the [[Zhentarim]] in their town. However, shortly before the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The date of this unknown. ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'' (dated [[1357 DR]]) only says this was \"recently\", implying sometime in 1357 DR or shortly before. Phintarn was found dead at the foot of the [[Lord's Keep]]. He'd been murdered by the Zhentarim; this was unproved but widely suspected by the people.\n\nOvernight, the mage [[Geildarr Ithym]] seized the Lord's Keep and claimed the throne. Soon after, four hundred \"[[Lord's Men]]\" arrived and in a handful of battles slaughtered all of the existing militia under the pretext that they were trouble-makers. The citizens found themselves under the \"protection\" of the Lord's Men. Thus, Llorkh was quickly and quietly conquered by the Zhentarim and under the control of their puppet.\n\nShortly after, [[Phintarn's brother]] died mysteriously one night, and [[Worried Wyvern (Llorkh)|his inn]] was razed the very next day."
