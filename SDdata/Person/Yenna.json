        "mainbody": "'''Yenna''' was a girl living in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Yenna had shaggy red hair down to her shoulders, tanned skin adorned with freckles, and [[Wikipedia:Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]: her right eye green, and her left one blue. Due to her poor status, Yenna often wore ragged articles of clothing.",
        "Personality": "Yenna was awkward, uncomfortably asking for help since her mother mysteriously disappeared. She was also naive, believing that her mother would return soon despite growing evidence to the contrary. Despite this, Yenna was enthusiastic about helping out the [[Absolute Adversaries]], and grateful that they had a place for her to reside. Over time, she began to accept that her beloved mother might not return, and elected to remain with the group and help out in what ways she could, such as cooking and selling supplies.",
        "Possessions": "Yenna had a pet cat, [[Grub]], whom she regarded as her best friend. She also possessed her own paring knife.",
        "Activities": "Yenna's favorite pastime was cooking, having learned the skill from her mother, and she had dreams of opening a [[soup]] shop in the future with her.",
        "History": "In or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Yenna's mother [[Emery]] disappeared, having been sick for some time and heavily implied by her pet cat [[Grub]] to have gone off somewhere and peacefully passed away to spare her daughter the pain, comparing it to a cat losing its last life. However, Yenna, whether through willful ignorance or genuine optimism, believed her mother would return. After some time had passed, Yenna had run out of food and money, and took to the streets with Grub in search of aid. \n\nIn 1492 DR, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Yenna encountered a group of individuals who had been infected with [[mind flayer]] tadpoles, and elected to ask them for help, mentioning that her mother had disappeared and was not sure when, or if, she would return."
