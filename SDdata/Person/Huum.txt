Huum was a mind flayer who resided in Sporedome in the late 15 century DR.
Purple-skinned and hairless, Huums tentacles writhed around his mouth.
Huum kept to himself mostly, living something of a hermit existence in Sporedome and only communicating with nearby myconids.
Skilled in the psionic arts like most mind flayers, Huum was able to communicate telepathically with ease and even read minds. Despite this, his ability to read minds was not strong enough to pry into the thoughts of Solom Nedrazak, a powerful drow archmage.
Huum considered a certain brooch, in the possession of Solom Nedrazak, to be his.
In his abode, Huum had control over a one-way teleportation circle to Szith Morcane.
He was on friendly terms with the myconids of Sporedome but held a dislike for the leader of Szith Morcane, Solom Nedrazak.
Circa 1490 DR, Huum resided in Sporedome alongside a community of myconids. He sought to acquire a brooch from Solom Nedrazak, which Huum believed protected the drow archmage from his psionic power. In actuality, the brooch was nonmagical, and Soloms willpower was simply stronger than Huums abilities, and the former had managed to convince the illithid that the brooch protected him.
Huum acted as a proxy for its elder brain to join the assault on Maerimydra.
