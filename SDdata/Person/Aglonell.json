        "History": "Aglonell was a trapper and hunter living near [[Bryn Shander]] in the [[Ten Towns]]. In 1485, he warned of the threat of [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]] after finding several traps raided and small animals stolen. In fact, the culprits were [[wererat]]s of [[Ship Rethnor]]. Aglonell spoke of his problems with [[Mithann]], who recruited adventurers to investigate."
