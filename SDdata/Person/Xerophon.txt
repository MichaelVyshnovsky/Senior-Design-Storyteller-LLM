edition Monster Manual]] (p. 82) for Xerophons stat block. His alignment, challenge rating, and abilities are taken from there.
Xerophon was a doppelganger magically imprisoned in the Netherese city of Ythryn.
In its guise as a human, Xerophon looked like a sickly, thin, middle-aged man with a streak of silver running through its long, black hair. It had one green eye and one blue eye.
The doppelganger valued self-preservation above all else, and had no qualms about resorting to deceit, murder&mdashor even friendly cooperation&mdashto achieve this. Xerophon constantly attempted to read the thoughts of the creatures around it to try and glean beneficial information.
Like other doppelgangers, Xerophon could assume the appearance of other humanoids, and could read the surface thoughts of those around it.
Not long before Ythryn crashed into the Reghed Glacier in the , Xerophon infiltrated the flying city. It murdered and stole the identity of a Netherese sage and tried to gain access to the Spire of Iriolarthas, but was caught and imprisoned. Even worse, Xerophons jailer was a wizard with a keen interest in magical experimentation. The doppelganger was an interesting test subject for the jailer, who wanted to study Xerophons shapeshifting ability and distill it, somehow, into a potion.
When not being experimented on, Xerophon was strapped to an operating table and magically sequestered away&mdashinvisible and in suspended animation. This was the state Xerophon was in when Ythryn fell, which meant the doppelganger was still alive as of , over 1500 years after he first entered the Netherese enclave.
