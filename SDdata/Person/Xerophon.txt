'''Xerophon''' was a [[doppelganger]] [[magic]]ally imprisoned in the [[Netheril|Netherese]] city of [[Ythryn]].

==Description==
In its guise as a [[human]], Xerophon looked like a sickly, thin, middle-aged man with a streak of silver running through its long, black hair. It had one green eye and one blue eye.

==Personality==
The doppelganger valued self-preservation above all else, and had no qualms about resorting to deceit, murder&mdash;or even friendly cooperation&mdash;to achieve this. Xerophon constantly attempted to read the thoughts of the creatures around it to try and glean beneficial information.

==Abilities==
Like other doppelgangers, Xerophon could assume the appearance of other humanoids, and could read the surface thoughts of those around it.

==History==
Not long before Ythryn crashed into the [[Reghed Glacier]] in the {{YearlinkName|-343}}, Xerophon infiltrated the flying city. It murdered and stole the identity of a [[Netherese]] sage and tried to gain access to the [[Spire of Iriolarthas]], but was caught and imprisoned. Even worse, Xerophon's jailer was a [[wizard]] with a keen interest in magical experimentation. The doppelganger was an interesting test subject for the jailer, who wanted to study Xerophon's shapeshifting ability and distill it, somehow, into a [[potion]].

When not being experimented on, Xerophon was strapped to an operating table and magically ''[[sequester]]ed'' away&mdash;invisible and in suspended animation. This was the state Xerophon was in when Ythryn fell, which meant the doppelganger was still alive as of {{Yearlink|1489}}, over 1500 years after he first entered the Netherese enclave.
