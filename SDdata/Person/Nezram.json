        "mainbody": "'''Nezram''', known as the '''World-Walker''', was a powerful [[Mulhorand]]i [[wizard]] who traveled the [[cosmology|planes]] extensively.",
        "Activities": "Nezram was a wizard with a passion for [[gem]]-based magic, and he specialized in planar and transportation magic as well. where he created several spells and wrote the spell tome known as ''[[Unique Mageries]]''<ref> as well as crafting several unique magic items, such as the ''[[Claw of Nezram]]''.<ref>",
        "History": "In [[643 DR]], Nezram began a centuries-long journey in the [[plane]]s after having discovered the ancient ruins of [[Okoth]]. Searching for clues about the fabled [[sarrukh]], one of the [[Creator race]]s, he used an ancient Okhotian [[portal]] to travel to the [[outer planes]].\n\nIn the late 14th century [[DR]], after hearing of the return of [[Thultanthar]] and the discovery of [[Deep Imaskar]], he returned home to his tower, which he found ruined With the help of his mortal descendants, who had become known as the [[Nezramites]], he built a new tower in the town of [[Nezras (town)|Nezras]].\n\nA few years after Nezram went again to explore the planes, searching again for the sarrukh, until he learned about the [[Spellplague]]. When Nezram returned to [[Toril]], he found Mulhorand was no more and in its place was a new nation, [[High Imaskar]]. Blaming the Imaskari for the Spellplague, he began to plot the eventual fall of High Imaskar. In [[1479 DR]], Nezram subverted High Planner [[Yanay]], a member of the [[Body of Artificers, Planners, and Apprehenders]], gaining her aid to the Mulhorandi cause.\n\nDuring Mulhorand's reclamation war against High Imaskar, Nezram provided a great deal of help to the gods, enabling them to more easily overthrow the occupiers and drive them out of his homeland.<ref>",
        "Relatives": "Many of Nezram's children were slain by Chathuulandroth when the dragon attacked his tower, but a few survived, as did other relatives, who went on to produce a sizable number of descendants, known as Nezramites, who formed their own community, surviving east of Mulhorand.<ref>\n\nPerhaps Nezram's most infamous relative was his grand-nephew<ref> [[Nezras]], who turned traitor against the forces of [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Weeping War]].<ref>\n\nHis [[familiar]] was a [[rat]] named Nezlit."
