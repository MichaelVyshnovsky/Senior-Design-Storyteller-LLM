'''Ulvryn Hamdarakh''' was the Sage of [[Saelmur]], active ''circa'' [[1284 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1284}}, Ulvryn Hamdarakh penned and published a collection of ruminations on the topic of mortality, aptly titled ''[[Musings on Mortality]]''. In the book, Ulvryn conceded his thought to a simple point: whatever the purpose of life was, it was of great amusement to the gods.
