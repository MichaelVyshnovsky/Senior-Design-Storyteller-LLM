Adnan was gaunt and frail. He often wore a dark grey aba. On the rare occasion when he smiled, he revealed missing teeth and blood-red gums. Adnan rarely raised his voice above a whisper.\nAdnans physical weakness masked the awesome magical power he wielded.\nThough he was a powerful shair in his own right, Adnan truly excelled at giving genies specific commands so that they could not find ways to twist his words to suit their own needs.\nAdnan constructed his wondrous tower in the Pilgrims District in a single night with the help of several tasked architect genies.

Students who were able to make it back to Adnans tower were accepted, those who did not were never heard from again.

Sadly, she never returned. Because of past insults committed against the genie rulers, Adnan dared not travel to the elemental planes himself to discover what happened to her.\nGenies trembled at the name of Adnan al-Raqi, for the shair slew, imprisoned, or humiliated more genies than any other shair in recent history. Most genies wished for him to die a horrible death.\nUpon his arrival in Huzuz in 1357 DR, Adnan presented Grand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir with the gift of a powerful efreeti named Hassan to serve as a guardian for the Royal Harim. He once sought to curry favor with the court, but decided against that after an unfortunate encounter with Jiraad, a noble marid.\nAdnans familiar was an efreetikin named Hakim.\nThrough his many dealings with genies, Adnan amassed an impressive collection of magical items including many scrolls, a staff of striking, a ring of shooting stars, a ring of genie summoning, a pair of genie prisons, an iron flask, and wands of magic missiles, frost, conjuration, lightning, enemy detection, paralyzation."
