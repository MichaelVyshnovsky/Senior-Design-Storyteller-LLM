'''Haliyra Ravenfast''' was an assassin member of the [[Hand of Yartar]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], a patrol of the [[Twelve]] near [[Triboar]] had defeated some cultists of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] and recovered a ''[[devastation orb]]''. They went back to Yartar with the orb but, just after they put it in the city's vaults, [[Nareen Dhest]] of the Hands of Yartar stole it. After examining it, the Hands of Yartar decided to sell it in an auction at the [[Wink and Kiss]] tavern. However, secretly, Haliyra sold it to the [[Kraken Society]].

She stayed in the tavern while waiting for the right time to kill Naaren and seize the orb, but the intervention of some adventurers saved Naaren and Haliyra was killed.
