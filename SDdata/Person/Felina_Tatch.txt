'''Felina Tatch''' was a [[priestess]] on a quest to release tortured spirits of the [[undead]] from their cursed existence sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Felina used her [[enchanted]] [[flail]] called ''[[Last Rest]]'' in her righteous pursuit. Eventually, the priestess met her doom at the hands of the [[vampire]] [[Milikaia]], who slew Felina and turned her into a fellow blood-sucking undead. Sometime later, Felina was seen wandering the graveyard of her hometown, still destroying the undead. Milikaia's fate remain unknown.
