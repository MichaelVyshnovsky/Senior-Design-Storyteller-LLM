'''Zeno''' was a [[half-elf]] [[mercenary]] inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Zeno would fight for whoever paid him the most, though he did have a tendency to choose the underdog in a fight if the pay was the same.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
