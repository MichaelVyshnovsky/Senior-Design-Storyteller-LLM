        "mainbody": "'''Rebekkah Darklyte''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Eilistraee]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the acting high priestess of [[The Dark Dancer]], a controversial and troubled shrine to the goddess in that city.",
        "History": "Aiming to promote peace between drow and other races, Rebekkah Darklyte worked to establish a shrine in Ravens Bluff.\n\nThus aided, Rebekkah Darklyte and her followers rebuilt a warehouse in the Harbor District and renovated it as the shrine called The Dark Dancer. However, they did not obtain a charter from the city's [[Clerical Circle]], Work on the shrine and warehouse was completed in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], and it was soon opened and made public.\n\nShortly after, the shrine was attacked by an angry, drow-hating mob, protesting against its opening. A small race riot erupted, as the mob hurled rocks and debris at the warehouse. Dozens of officers of the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] moved in to quell the unrest. The building itself took little damage, but most of the food and clothing that had been gathered for the needy of Ravens Bluff was ruined and several Watchmen were injured. Rebekkah treated the wounded guards at the scene and vowed to continue her work of promoting harmony. Despite this, many citizens remained hostile to the dark elves, the shrine remained a subject of great controversy, and the Watch kept close watch on their activities to prevent further trouble.\n\nRebekkah was once a guest of Lord [[Eskevelt Emmerdin]] at [[Emmer Hall]], the family's manor house outside the city. This was thanks to the Emmerdins' friendship of [[elves]]."
