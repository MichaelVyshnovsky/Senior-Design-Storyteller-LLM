        "History": "Gnarltooth's notoriety, the footnote in history, came from his tribe attacking gnome settlements sometime before 1372 DR. One of the towns targeted by him was the home of [[Elbix]], a gnome [[conjurer]] who famously owned a [[rod]] of \"great power.\" The town's leader summoned him to obliterate Gnarltooth and the ettins via the awesome powers of ''[[Elbix's Stonestick]]''. The terrified gnome met Gnarltooth on the battlefield, ready to be killed by the monster. Instead, the ettin snatched Elbix to take a closer look and received an accidental poke in the eye from the \"mighty\" rod. The ettin chieftain stumbled backwards and impaled himself on his own [[spear]], ending his marauding career. The remaining ettins fled without their leader."
