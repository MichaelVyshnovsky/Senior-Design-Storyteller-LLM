        "mainbody": "narltooth was the chieftain of a marauding ettin tribe who preyed on gnome settlements sometime before 1372 DR.\nGnarltooths notoriety, the footnote in history, came from his tribe attacking gnome settlements sometime before 1372 DR. One of the towns targeted by him was the home of Elbix, a gnome conjurer who famously owned a rod of \"great power.\" The towns leader summoned him to obliterate Gnarltooth and the ettins via the awesome powers of Elbixs Stonestick. The terrified gnome met Gnarltooth on the battlefield, ready to be killed by the monster. Instead, the ettin snatched Elbix to take a closer look and received an accidental poke in the eye from the \"mighty\" rod. The ettin chieftain stumbled backwards and impaled himself on his own spear, ending his marauding career. The remaining ettins fled without their leader."
