Wingle Spewgold was a male gnome illusionist and thief and a spy of Glinda Scatterstar in the Rogues Guild of Hillsfar in 1367 DR.
He used his illusions to pass as an ordinary human thief.
Wingle was a very daring individual. He confided in no one about his secret identity but hoped that in time of need he could confide in paladins, good clerics, and rangers.
