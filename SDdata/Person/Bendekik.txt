'''Bendekik''' was a [[deep gnome]] priest in [[Blingdenstone]].

==History==
Bendekik was the high priest of the city until [[1371 DR]], the year of a [[drow]] attack. Bendekik remained in the city and made a curse that no drow be able to use the power of the earth. During the fighting, he killed seven drow warriors before he died.

In [[1479 DR]], his assistant [[Pingtu]] was back in the city and was the new head priest. Bendekik somehow manifested to him and explained how to end the curse.{{Cite digital book/Reclaiming Blingdenstone|21-23}}
