Riyataivin was a merchant and investor in caravan trades in the city of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.
Riyataivin had no set house in Waterdeep, but rather spent time in various different rooming houses and inns in the Southern Ward. In terms of business, he made consistent profit margins by dealing in the buying and selling of cargo, draft animals, wagons, and warehouse space.
Riyataivin was generally well respected among his colleagues. He had no particularly special knowledge or connection or the Lords of Waterdeep.
In 1357 DR,Page 14 of Waterdeep and the North states that the news provided in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set, "...is current [to this book] as of early Mirtul, in the Year of the Prince. the Shadow Thieves of Athkatla sent an assassin to kill Riyataivin, having mistaken his penchant for acting mysterious as evidence of him being a Lord of Waterdeep. Armed with poisoned daggers, the assassin attacked an adventurer by mistake who closely resembled the merchant.
