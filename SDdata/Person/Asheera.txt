'''Asheera''' was an [[elf]] [[paladin]] from the world of [[Azallah]] who went on a quest to find and stop [[Morag]] of the [[Old One|Old Ones]]. After entering the [[Source Stone]], in the [[demiplane]] there, she met the [[Hero of Neverwinter]], who was on the same mission, in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.

==Description ==
In the view of the Hero, she was identical in appearance and voice to [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]]. However, she was wearing different clothes.

==Personality==
Her behaviors seemed very similar to Aribeth's before the latter was [[Blackguard|corrupted]]. She was motivated by vengeance and a need to protect her home. Asheera also showed great determination towards fulfilling her mission. She was honorable to point that no one seemed to question it. Like Aribeth she was also trusting towards the Hero of Neverwinter at the moment of their meeting. She and Aribeth both spoke in a nearly identical manner.

==Possessions==
Asheera's garb appeared alien to the Hero of Neverwinter. She possessed a [[Asheera's amulet|magic amulet]], which she got from [[magic-user]]s of her world, to aid the struggle against Morag and her army of Old Ones. The [[enchanted]] item increased the wearer's resistance towards electricity, [[fire]], [[magic]], and attacks of [[:Category:Reptilian_humanoids|reptilians]].

== Activities==
Asheera was part of the [[Shining Order]]. Before or during the invasion of her city, she successfully resisted Morag's temptations to help her with invading [[Sahaladar]]. Because her homeworld, Azallah, was under attack by Morag's forces, Asheera and others were sent into the Source Stone to kill the Old One queen and stop the invasion. However, they were defeated and she was the only survivor of the expedition. While fighting a losing battle against the Old Ones, Asheera was saved by the Hero of Neverwinter and told them about her homeworld and the war. The magic keeping her in the demiplane was weakening, and the time of Asheera's leaving the plane was coming closer, so the woman offered the Hero her [[amulet]] to support their efforts in finishing Morag off and finally ending the war against the Old Ones. It was unknown if Asheera avoided a confrontation with the Hero or peacefully left for Azallah.

==History==
Not much is known about Asheera before she entered the Source Stone. At some point she became a [[knight]] of the Shining Order. Just like Aribeth, Morag attemted to recruit her via haunting dreams that promised power. In contrast to Aribeth, she was able to succesfully resist those temptations. Her story suggests, that she was considered a competent enough paladin in her homeworld, to join the mission to stop Morag's forces.

=== Trivia ===

*While she looks identical to Aribeth de Tylmarande both in her portrait and according to the Hero of [[Neverwinter]], the game Neverwinter Nights classifies her as an elf, while Aribeth is a [[half-elf]].
*The names of the sound files with dialogue spoken by Asheera begin with vs_naribetf.
*Asheera would not be able to level up as a paladin, because of her [[alignment]]. Gaining paladin levels is only possible for Lawful Good characters in Neverwinter Nights. This means she either changed her alignment during paladin training or the requirements for developing as a paladin are different in her world.
