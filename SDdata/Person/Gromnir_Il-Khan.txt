'''Gromnir Il-Khan''' was a [[half-orc]] [[Bhaalspawn]] who briefly ruled [[Saradush]] while the city was under siege by [[Yaga-Shura]].

==Possessions==
Gromnir wielded two enchanted [[morning star]]s in combat, one of which was the ''[[Ice Star]]''.<ref>

==History==
Gromnir and his garrison of soldiers had been brought into the city by [[Melissan]] along with other Bhaalspawn, ostensibly to keep them safe. When Yaga-Shura besieged the city in an effort to destroy all the Bhaalspawn within, Gromnir locked himself up in the palace with his closest followers, and while the local militia fought against the invaders, his men were content to bully and exploit the town's populace.

Gromnir himself was seemingly paranoid about Melissan, thinking she wanted to "turn Bhaalspawn against Bhaalspawn until all are dead." He turned out to be right, though few others would have suspected it. Ultimately, he was killed by [[Gorion's Ward]] at her bidding.
