        "mainbody": "Ironbark was a treant in Cormanthor.\nIn 1459 DR, Ironbark and two other treants were captured by the dracolich Dretchroyaster, who considered them a delicacy. In time, the dracolich slowly drained them of their life force.\nBy 1479 DR, only a half-mad Ironbark was still alive. That year, some adventurers infiltrated the lair and met the treant.\nThe long period of privation and fear had made him quite insane."
