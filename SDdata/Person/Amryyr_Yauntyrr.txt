'''Amryyr Yauntyrr''' was a courier in [[Skullport]] for the [[Dark Dagger]].

==History==
Amryrr was born to [[House Druu'giir]], In [[1370 DR]], he still held on his house insignia but his relationship with his house was as good s non-existent.

He met his best friend [[Malakuth Tabuirr]] in Menzoberranzan when the latter still ran caravans in service of his merchant house in [[Karsoluthiyl]]. At some point, he became a member of the [[Dark Dagger]], the main reason for his entry was that his friend Malakuth was the leader of the local cell.

==Personality==
Amryyr had a reserved personality and valued his friendship with Malakuth Tabuirr.

Amryrr followed [[Vhaeraun]] and hated [[Lolth]]'s priestesses for their readiness to hurt people to satisfy religious demands. In other words, female drow who didn’t act in such ways received his respect and friendship as did [[Xalyth]],

==Activities==
Amryrr was mostly traveling as part of his courier work between Skullport and many [[Underdark]] settlements, including his hometown of [[Menzoberranzan]]. He was under steady employment at the [[Fatted Bookworm]], But mostly he wasn’t in Skullport and followed his duties as a member of the Dark Dagger as a courier wandering between Skullport and various Underdark settlements, among others his birthplace Menzoberranzan.

Apart from courier work, he worked as a supplier for Xalyth’s gem and spell component enterprise. 

==Relationships==
Malakuth was the best friend of Amryrr and the two were very close, knowing each other's secrets. The only female [[drow]] that Amryrr trusted was Xalyth, who had conquered his respect with her calm behavior, her intelligence, and her business mind.
