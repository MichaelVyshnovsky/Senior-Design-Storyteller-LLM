        "Personality": "Befitting his rank, Greymace had a commanding air that was evident every time he stepped into a room.",
        "History": "On [[Uktar 2]] of the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, the city of Marsember was assaulted by [[shade]]s during [[Netheril]]'s invasion of [[Cormyr]]. Greymace was able to accompany Grand Duke [[Farnig Seasilver]] aboard the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]'' during the conflict, sailing away from the city. Unfortunately, the Duke Seasilver was slain shortly thereafter, though Greymace's fate was unknown."
