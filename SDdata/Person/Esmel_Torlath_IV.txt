King Esmel Torlath IV was an Amnian monarch of the Torlath dynasty who had a short and tragic reign.
Esmel was the eldest son of King Brinnaq I. He had at least five brothers including Jhanos I, and one sister, Leluia. His son was Esmar.
Esmel IV came to the throne on the death of his father King Brinnaq I, but only ruled for two years before Leluias husband Arbas slew all the Torlath males in Amn and seized the throne. Esmel died in 696 DR by way of poisoning, and his newborn son Esmar did not escape either. The family was avenged by Jhanos I, who returned from aboard the following year and killed Arbas, then became king himself.
