King '''Esmel Torlath IV''' was an [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Torlath]] dynasty who had a short and tragic reign.

==Relationships==
Esmel was the eldest son of King [[Brinnaq Torlath I|Brinnaq I]]. He had at least five brothers including [[Jhanos Torlath I|Jhanos I]], and one sister, [[Leluia Torlath|Leluia]]. His son was [[Esmar Torlath|Esmar]].

==History==
Esmel IV came to the throne on the death of his father King Brinnaq I, but only ruled for two years before Leluia's husband [[Arbas]] slew all the Torlath males in Amn and seized the throne. Esmel died in [[696 DR]] by way of poisoning, and his newborn son Esmar did not escape either. The family was avenged by Jhanos I, who returned from aboard the following year and killed Arbas, then became king himself.
