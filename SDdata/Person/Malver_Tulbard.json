        "Possessions": "Tulbard possessed a molded, silk covered throat & chest plate, a protection would eventually prove quite useful.",
        "Activities": "As a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]], Malver's duties extended to inspecting [[Suzail]]ian shops, such as the one owned by the [[Alchemist]] [[Immaero Sraunter]].\n\nMalver enjoyed [[butter]]ed [[snail]]s served in spiced [[wine]], like the ones offered at [[Glocklin's]] or [[The Bright Sammer]] - upscale dining clubs along the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]].",
        "History": "Fearing that this War Wizard may investigate [[Immaero Sraunter|Sraunter's]] shop around the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, [[Manshoon]] decided to eliminate him while he could. Malver was eating his beloved buttered snails at [[Gocklin's]], as he was wont to do, when the plan was brought to motion. \n\nManshoon teleported to the establishment, taking the still dining Malver by surprise and swift lightning. Malver's shields were the first to fall, with his armour taking the next brunt. Were it not for the intervention of Lord [[Tauntshaw]], and the subsequent assistance from spellcasters and nobles nearby, Malver would certainly have perished."
