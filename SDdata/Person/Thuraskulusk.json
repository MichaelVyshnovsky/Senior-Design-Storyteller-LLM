        "mainbody": "'''Thuraskulusk''' was an ancient [[black dragon]] who was worshiped by [[Saslick]]'s tribe of [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Lizard Marsh]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "The alliance between the black dragon and Saslick's tribe was forged sometime before 1372 DR. The lizardfolk, under the religious leadership of [[shaman]] [[Uzzak-Szalzik]], treated the ancient wyrm as their god. In exchange, Thuraskulusk protected the tribe from invaders, adventurers, and the rival lizardfolk led by [[Redeye]]. The lizardfolk and the shaman erected a statue idol of the black dragon and used it as their main place of worship.\n\nUnder the protection of the mighty dragon, Redeye couldn't fold Saslick's tribe under his control, and so hatched a devious plan. He snuck into Thuraskulusk's lair and stole one of her eggs. The dragon started tracking the thief across the Lizard Marsh. Redeye offered information to the [[Hero of Daggerford]] on the strange occurrences around the city of [[Daggerford]] in exchange for depositing the dragon egg into Chief Saslick's hut, thuis framing him for the theft. The Hero was ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into a lizardfolk by the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] and infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe. The plan was successful, and Thuraskulusk followed the egg's smell to the chieftain's hut. The mighty dragon accused Saslick of treachery and slew the chief, dissolving the alliance and allowing Redeye to claim rulership of the tribe."
