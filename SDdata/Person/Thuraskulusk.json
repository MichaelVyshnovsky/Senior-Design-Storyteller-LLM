        "mainbody": "Thuraskulusk was an ancient black dragon who was worshiped by Saslicks tribe of lizardfolk of the Lizard Marsh circa 1372 DR.\nThe alliance between the black dragon and Saslicks tribe was forged sometime before 1372 DR. The lizardfolk, under the religious leadership of shaman Uzzak-Szalzik, treated the ancient wyrm as their god. In exchange, Thuraskulusk protected the tribe from invaders, adventurers, and the rival lizardfolk led by Redeye. The lizardfolk and the shaman erected a statue idol of the black dragon and used it as their main place of worship.\nUnder the protection of the mighty dragon, Redeye couldnt fold Saslicks tribe under his control, and so hatched a devious plan. He snuck into Thuraskulusks lair and stole one of her eggs. The dragon started tracking the thief across the Lizard Marsh. Redeye offered information to the Hero of Daggerford on the strange occurrences around the city of Daggerford in exchange for depositing the dragon egg into Chief Saslicks hut, thuis framing him for the theft. The Hero was polymorphed into a lizardfolk by the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh and infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe. The plan was successful, and Thuraskulusk followed the eggs smell to the chieftains hut. The mighty dragon accused Saslick of treachery and slew the chief, dissolving the alliance and allowing Redeye to claim rulership of the tribe."
