'''Torisk Haut''' was a member of the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He served as the "spymaster" and second-in-command of the [[Thay]]an [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]] in the city of [[Proskur]], under [[khazark]] [[Chathin Zurn]].

Spymaster Haunt oversaw the security of the enclave in Proskur, closely monitoring any residents that he believed were suspicious or otherwise unreliable. He accomplished this by means of a vast network of informants and agents that fed him intel from within the enclave, and throughout the rest of the mercantile city.
