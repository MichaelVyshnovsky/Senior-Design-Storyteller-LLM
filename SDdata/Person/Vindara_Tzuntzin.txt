Vindara Tzuntzin was a half-elf tavern owner inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was slim and carried herself with grace. Vindara was sarcastic and was quick to spurn suitors.
Vindara, along with her sister Allet, owned a popular tavern in Waterdeeps North Ward called the Misty Beard. She dreamed of founding a half-elf community in the Ardeep Forest.
She was a skilled wizard who enjoyed wielding a variety of wands including a wand of fear, wand of fire, wand of flame extinguishing, wand of illusion, wand of lightning, wand of paralyzation, and a wand of polymorphing.
She once ran the Black Gryphon inn in Elturel but wore out their welcome with their exotic employees and decided to try their hand in the City of Splendors.
