==Activities==
Ara was a pilot who helped safely guide incoming ships through the treacherous coral maze of Chaos Bay.

She ran afoul of the [[Corsair Council]] after demanding more pay and prestige for the sea elves living in Chaos Bay, even going to far as to reveal the secrets of safely navigating the coral maze to outsiders.
