Seek healing elsewhere.''|Velisha}}",
        "Description": "Velisha was a tiny, high-cheekboned [[drow]] woman with a sinister and serious demeanor. She had red eyes and red markings on her forehead and cheeks underneath the eyes. She wore a voluminous hooded [[robe]] that somewhat successfully his her diminutive stature.",
        "Personality": "Velisha was religiously strict and followed her deity's tenants. She refused healing to all but devotees of Shar and refused to answer questions as Shar did not share her secrets freely. However, she offered a collection of [[Sharran]] magic items and healing [[potion]]s for sale.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, High Priestess Velisha could be found deep in the Dark Lady's Promise by the temple's shrine. During that time, Velisha offered comfort to a disgraced murderous [[paladin]] of [[Lathander]] named [[Mantides]]. She was trying to convert the man to the worship of Shar, the Lady of Loss. She preyed on the man's sense of injustice and offered him a clean slate after all the acts of vengeance and murder he committed. She did not disclose that turning to Sharran faith involved sacrificing a part of his soul. It was unrecorded if Velisha was successful or if Mantides managed to recover the favor of his old deity."
