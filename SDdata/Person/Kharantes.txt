'''Kharantes''' was a [[yuan-ti]] [[half-fiend]] who usurped control of [[Oreme]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Personality==
A child of the [[Abyss]], Kharantes was the offspring of a female [[yuan-ti abomination]] and a male [[demon]]. After reaching maturity, he found his way to [[Faerûn]]. His hubris led him to believe his destiny was rulership over all the serpentfolk of the world, and then by extension, the world itself.

==History==
Kharantes learned about the history of the [[sarrukh]] while on Faerûn. Feeling an instant connection to the yuan-ti, he studied texts preserved since the ancient days and came to the conclusion that the sarrukh had squandered their position of dominance in the world. The yuan-ti's subsumed leadership of the [[Mhairshaulk|Mhairshaulk Empire]], on the [[Chultan]] peninsula far to the south, a sarrukh kingdom that the progenitors grew tired of and disinterested in, ingrained in him his notion that the yuan-ti were entitled to the mantle of ultimate rulership.

Kharantes discovered that, far to the north in the area that would become known as [[Anauroch]], the sarrukh established the [[Isstosseffifil|Isstosseffifil Empire]]. The city of Oreme was the capital of that realm. Kharantes studied carefully and discovered that Oreme was the repository of a vast magical knowledge, the ''[[Golden Skins of the World Serpent]]'' (the serpentfolk name for the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'').

His investigations led him to discover the location of Oreme and he entered the ruins with his entourage in [[1375 DR]]. His cunning and duplicity allowed him to gain an audience with Oreme's ruler, [[King Oreme]], and poison him with a special [[positoxin|toxin]]. With the king incapacitated, Kharantes took his own place on the throne. Soon after, Kharantes was deposed and defeated by an adventuring party in search of the [[Arthindol|Terraseer]].
