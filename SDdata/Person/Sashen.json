        "mainbody": "'''Sashen''' was a [[Zhentarim]] wizard and apprentice of [[Ashemmi]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Sashen was described as an owlish individual who wore dirty, wrinkled, and patched robes. He also wore thick spectacles without which he was nearly blind. That caused the other mages of Darkhold to only entrust him with spells that he could trigger at close range, lest he hit an ally.",
        "Personality": "Sashen was a cautious and silent individual, bordering on being dull with little insight. His primary interest was researching ancient magic and hidden lore and Sashen believed being in the Zhentarim was a good opportunity for him to do this. He had no interest in the intrigues and political plots of the Zhentarim.",
        "History": "Sashen was assigned to Darkhold to study under Ashemmi along with three other apprentices - [[Ilthond]], [[Kadorr ]], and [[Yarkul]]. Sashen was the least ambitious of the Ashemmi's pupils. He usually wandered the of dungeons of [[Faer√ªn]] with his bodyguards, searching for ancient knowledge."
