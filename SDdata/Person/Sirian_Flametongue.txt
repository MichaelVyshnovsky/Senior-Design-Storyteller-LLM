'''Sirian Flametongue''' was a hot-headed young [[red dragon]], spawn of [[Tam (dragon)|Tam]], who, unlike his mother, willingly and gladly allied himself with [[Lolth]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Sometime before 1370 DR, the red dragon Tam was convinced to join the High Priestess of Lolth, [[Azurna]], in Undermountain during her pursuit of [[Waterdeep]]'s destruction. Her hatchlings were used by the [[drow]] as powerful allies. One of the young dragons who gladly joined the malicious plot was Sirian Flametongue. Old enough to be a powerful agent, the dragon attacked the adventurer who infiltrated the drow stronghold while investigating the plot against the City of Splendors. The dragon was slain in the ensuing confrontation.
