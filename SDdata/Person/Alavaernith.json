        "mainbody": "lavaernith was a wizard active sometime prior to or in the early 3 century DR in southern Faerûn.\nResearchers after his time believed him to be close-mouthed about his secrets, and characteristically not effusive.\nHe had developed some spells. Two researchers in Moonshorn Tower claimed he lived \"south\".\nIn the mid–8 century, the researchers Tabarast and Beldrune discussed Alavaerniths three-cats spell upon finding notes regarding a different magic of apparently similar purpose. They soon concluded it was probably not his magic."
