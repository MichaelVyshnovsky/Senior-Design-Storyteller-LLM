Hassan Arslan was the firstborn son and heir of Kassim Arslan, Sheik of the Oasis of the White Palm, as of . His bride was kidnapped by Khalitharius almost as soon as they were bethrothed.
Hassan had sympathy for his brothers feelings of anger and jealousy at not being the heir, but he saw nothing that could be done about that hatred. He held up through the disappearance of his bride, but could sometimes lapse into sadness. He was desperate enough to accept any honest offer of help, even at a price hed eagerly yield his badge of office, a palm sign amulet identical to his fathers, if any help was forthcoming.
Hassan wore a scimitar, chain mail armor, and a shield, all of them with powerful enchantments.
Beyond his skills as a fighter, Hassan Arslan possessed heroic strength and amazing agility.
Hassan spoke for his father in audiences with strangers, as he did for the adventurers that ultimately released Martek.
Hassan did not spend much time in his tent after his bride was kidnapped, and only returned at night to sleep. Despite this change in his own attitude, he was concerned that his brother Korus had lately never attended the offering for the holy days, and was staying by himself.
According to Hogan Underwood, Hassan had been in the bar at the time of his brides disappearance. Hassan wandered the oasis sometimes. 
Though Hassan Arslans Charisma (Ch) score is listed as 2 in the module, that number is impossibly low for a human ability scores in 1st edition were generated by a roll of 3d6, which has a lower bound of 3. It is most likely a typo, where the intended number was 12 the adventure from which he is adapted has an otherwise identical character whose charisma is 12.
