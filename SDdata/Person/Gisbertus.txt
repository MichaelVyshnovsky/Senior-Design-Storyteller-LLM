Gisbertus was the bugbear steward and chamberlain of queen Zaranda Star. 
Gisbertus fretted over the other servants and often took it upon himself to cook for the queen, being an expert cook. His most notable feature was perhaps his articulate and refined manner of speech.
In Hammer of 1370 DR, master chef Thundaerl returned to Tethyr and offered his services to the queen. This caused a conflict with Gisbertus, who did not want to give up his kitchens. In the end, Thundaerl became the chef of the Great Hall while Gisbertus remained the head chef for the palace of Faerntarn itself.
