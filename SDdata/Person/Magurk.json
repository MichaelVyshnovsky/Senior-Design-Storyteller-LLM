        "mainbody": "'''Magurk''' was a male [[human]] [[fighter]] in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]]. A former soldier of the [[Purple Dragons]], Magurk was proprietor of the store called [[One-Armed Magurk's]].",
        "Personality": "He was a shrewd dealer, and one could not take advantage of him.",
        "Possessions": "Impressively, Magurk owned a ''+3 [[vorpal]] [[short sword]]'', which he kept under the counter.",
        "History": "After he lost his arm in battle, Magurk retired from the Purple Dragons and opened up his shop, buying and selling — no questions asked — goods looted by adventurers from ruins and dungeons found around Thunderstone. As Magurk was a former soldier of the Purple Dragons, the local contingent kept an eye on him and his store to make sure nothing bad happened to him.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Wolfmasters]] adventuring company stopped at Magurk's store seeking [[potion]]s that could somehow control [[black dragon]]s before they ventured into the [[Vast Swamp]] in search of [[Orvaskyte Keep]]. However, Magurk had no such thing, and came to despise the obnoxious [[Sembite]] adventurers and their excessive haggling."
