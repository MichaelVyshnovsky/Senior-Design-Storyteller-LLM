        "History": "During the Payit golden age, Tacal was a prince of [[Tulom-Itzi]]. When rumors of the beauty of the [[Payit]] princess [[Aliah]] reached him, Tacal decided that she should be with him, but she was promised to her half-brother [[Xetl]]. So Tacal assembled his retinue and devised a plot to strike during the wedding day, where he was among the guests with his parents and most of the Itza nobles, and kidnap her.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, Tacal and his warriors managed to kidnap Aliah but only with the deaths of most of his warriors. At last, in revenge, the Payit decided to slay the whole royal family of Tulom-Itzi. When Tacal, still surrounded by [[Ulatos]]'s armies, saw at a distance the bodies of his family, he killed Aliah out of desperation. Soon after, Payit arrows killed Tacal.\n\nThis act signaled the end of the Payit Golden Age."
