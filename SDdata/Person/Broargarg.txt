Broargarg was a white-haired bugbear belonging to the Frosthunger Horde of the Frozenfar in the late 15 century DR.
After the goblinoids of Dragonscar Gorge were forced into hard labor by Shattercrown and his frost giants in the late 15 century DR, Broargarg led an uprising that saw a large group of the Frosthunger Hordes goblin and bugbear members flee into Shimmersky Valley. They soon overran the Valleys inhabitants and claimed it as a new home.
The goblins continued attacks on travelers soon caught the attention of adventurers from Waterdeep, who drove back the Horde and faced Broargarg in battle. Upon being defeated, Broargarg dropped their weapons and bounded across the snowy valley back toward the Gorge while the adventurers pursued.
