'''Broargarg''' was a white-haired [[bugbear]] belonging to the [[Frosthunger Horde]] of the [[Frozenfar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
After the [[goblinoid]]s of [[Dragonscar Gorge]] were forced into hard labor by [[Shattercrown]] and his [[frost giant]]s in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Broargarg led an uprising that saw a large group of the Frosthunger Horde's [[goblin]] and bugbear members flee into [[Shimmersky Valley]]. They soon overran the Valley's inhabitants and claimed it as a new home.

The goblins' continued attacks on travelers soon caught the attention of [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]], who drove back the Horde and faced Broargarg in battle. Upon being defeated, Broargarg dropped their weapons and bounded across the snowy valley back toward the Gorge while the adventurers pursued.
