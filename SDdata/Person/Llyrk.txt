When roaming the [[Underdark]], Llyrk was taken captive by Baeloth Barrityl outside [[Menzoberranzan]] and made to fight in the [[Black Pits]]. He was known for summoning [[skeleton]]s with extraordinary speed, and his skill at this was even praised by his master.

==History==
He and his skeletal minions were slain by the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits]] and their party.
