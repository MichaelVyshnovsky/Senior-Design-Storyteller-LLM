Llyrk was a necromancer and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.
Llyrk was described by Baeloth Barrityl to be an insolent and minor spellcaster. He carried a quarterstaff and wore a robe.
When roaming the Underdark, Llyrk was taken captive by Baeloth Barrityl outside Menzoberranzan and made to fight in the Black Pits. He was known for summoning skeletons with extraordinary speed, and his skill at this was even praised by his master.
He and his skeletal minions were slain by the Champion of Baeloths Pits and their party.
