Mackester Claypipe was a halfling assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR.
Mackester on the surface was the houndsmaster of House Thalavar and the most skilled canine expert of Westgate, loved both by her masters and the citys halfling community. However, she was secretly also a Night Mask assassin. Mackester was in fact also a member of a small cult of worshipers of Urogalan who believed that the god needed sacrifices, and she always remained confident in this doctrine. For this, Mackester always interred her victims underground as a sacrifice to Urogalan.
