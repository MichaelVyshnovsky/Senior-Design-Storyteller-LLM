Kithian Moss was a girl that lived with her family on a peat farm in the Twilight Marsh during the late 15 century DR.
Kithian was the daughter to Millivent and Haldred Moss. She had four siblings, Alleena, Bo, Quayle, and Volland.
During the 1480s DR, Kithian and her family were attacked on their farm by a band of goblin raiders from the Foulwater tribe. Kithian and nearly all of her siblings, along with their father and a number of farmhands were unable to get away. While the exact details of the attack were unknown, it appeared as if they were taken captive by the monstrous creatures. Kithians mother Millivent managed to escape along with Bo and get away safely to a nearby town.
