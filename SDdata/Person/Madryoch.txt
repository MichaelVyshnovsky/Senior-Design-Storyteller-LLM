Master Oriseus tried to involve Aeron Morieth in a rite to bind him to the power of the Shadow Stone, which the student escaped.
Over the course of five years, Madryochs schemes led him to rise to the position of Sceptanar by . As the Sceptanar, he proceeded with a ritual to use the power of an artifact he had created before, the Shadow Stone, to increase his own magical power.

The fate of Madryoch and his possessed body after Aeron Morieth caused the destruction of the Stone was unknown.
