Nathgarl was a minor magelord of the kingdom of Athalantar.
Nathgarl was a minor wizard from Unther and an apprentice of Maulygh. He was hired with his master by the prince Felodar Aumar in Calimshan to fight the magelords of Athalantar. Quickly however, Maulygh and Nathgarl joined the ranks of the magelords.
After a fatal dinner in Hastarl on 229 DR where Maulygh died, the other magelords killed Nathgarl as they didnt trust him.
