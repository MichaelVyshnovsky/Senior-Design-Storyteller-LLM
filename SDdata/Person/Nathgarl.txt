'''Nathgarl''' was a minor [[magelord]] of the kingdom of [[Athalantar]].

==Biography==
Nathgarl was a minor [[wizard]] from [[Unther]] and an apprentice of [[Maulygh]]. He was hired with his master by the prince [[Felodar Aumar]] in [[Calimshan]] to fight the magelords of Athalantar. Quickly however, Maulygh and Nathgarl joined the ranks of the magelords.

After a fatal dinner in [[Hastarl]] on [[229 DR]] where Maulygh died, the other magelords killed Nathgarl as they didn't trust him.<ref>{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|26-37}}
