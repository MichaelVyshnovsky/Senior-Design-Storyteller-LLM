'''Shikata''' was the leader of a [[salamander]] tribe that dwelled within the lower levels of [[Dorn's Deep]] in [[1281 DR]].
{{Quote|''When I am done killing you, your body shall be cast into the flames for our spirits to feast upon.''|Shikata to a group of [[adventurer]]s.}}

==History==
Like the rest of his salamander tribe, Shikata was once a native of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] that had come through the [[portal]]s within the Great Forge of Dorn's Deep.

Shikata and his salamanders oversaw the mines within Dorn's Deep and its enslaved [[svirfneblin]] workers for his ally [[Marketh]], as well as guarding the entrance to his palace, referring to the area as the latter's "domain." Despite his best efforts, he could not prevent several salamanders of his tribe from going rogue and forming a faction bent on asserting dominance over the other creatures dwelling in the Lower Levels of Dorn's Deep.

==Relationships==
Shikata was allied with the mad [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Malavon Despana]], the bandit Marketh, and their boss [[Belhifet]].
