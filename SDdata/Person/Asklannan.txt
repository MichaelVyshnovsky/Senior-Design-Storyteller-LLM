'''Asklannan''' was the owner of a spell library that was consulted in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Of note, Asklannan possessed a library of [[spellbook]]s. At least two members of the [[Zhentarim]] had accessed his spell library by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, the [[Zhentarim]] mage [[Ghaubhan Szaurr]] put in motion a plan to join his blood with that of [[Shandril Shessair]] in an attempt to gain her [[spellfire]] powers, an act strongly implied to be carnal in nature. He was stopped by [[Manshoon]], who slew him and his forces before they could move against Shandril; Manshoon explained he'd found Asklannan's book, strongly implying Asklannan had written the book himself.
