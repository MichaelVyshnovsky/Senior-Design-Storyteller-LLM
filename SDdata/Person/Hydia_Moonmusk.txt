Hydia Moonmusk was the daughter of Kriga Moonmusk and leader of Blue Bear Tribe members allied with Kayalithicas stone giants.
Hydia, like most of her tribe, agreed with the stone giant thane Kayalithica that civilization must be destroyed.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, they lived inside the Deadstone Cleft together with the giants. Hydia lived with three cave bears in a dry cave tucked under the grassy bulge of the mountains.
Hidya was the daughter of the Great Chief of the Blue Bear Tribe.
