'''Raerlin''' was a [[Calishite]] human and briefly, apprentice to [[Elminster]], until he stole a key to a container of old [[spellbook]]s in [[Elminster's tower]]. Later, he became a [[lich]], but Elminster assumed that he had been eaten by a [[dragon]].

==History==
When Elminster recovered the key to his door in the {{YearlinkName|1336}}The web article "Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction" dates this short story to [[1355 DR]]. This is assumed to be an error as the author, Ed Greenwood, has repeatedly affirmed that "Elminster at the Magefair" is set in 1336 DR., Raerlin opened a gateway directly into Elminster's tower (which was magically protected) and attacked Elminster and [[Storm Silverhand]]. He drained Elminster's magical energy to power his own, and in doing so, defeated Elminster. Storm noticed that one of the books in the room was glowing in a similar way to the lich's gate, and burned it. The book was Raerlin's ''[[phylactery]]'' and Raerlin was destroyed. Elminster recovered without serious harm.
