Raerlin was a Calishite human and briefly, apprentice to Elminster, until he stole a key to a container of old spellbooks in Elminsters tower. Later, he became a lich, but Elminster assumed that he had been eaten by a dragon.
When Elminster recovered the key to his door in the The web article "Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction" dates this short story to 1355 DR. This is assumed to be an error as the author, Ed Greenwood, has repeatedly affirmed that "Elminster at the Magefair" is set in 1336 DR., Raerlin opened a gateway directly into Elminsters tower (which was magically protected) and attacked Elminster and Storm Silverhand. He drained Elminsters magical energy to power his own, and in doing so, defeated Elminster. Storm noticed that one of the books in the room was glowing in a similar way to the lichs gate, and burned it. The book was Raerlins phylactery and Raerlin was destroyed. Elminster recovered without serious harm.
