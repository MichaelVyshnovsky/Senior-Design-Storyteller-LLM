Aznar Thrul, Zulkir of Evocation and Tharchion of the Priador, was one of the eight rulers of Thay and its Red Wizards.
An exceedingly cruel and evil man, he was the greatest rival of the lich Szass Tam, Zulkir of Necromancy.
Thrul was originally trained in the Art at Blackstaff Tower by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun. By the mid-to-late 14 century DR, he had his own apprentice Mantorra Hennaflame.
Ibbalar Thrul, a Red Mage of Thay and one of the apprentices of Halaster Blackcloak from mid-14 century DR, was likely Aznars relative.
During the Salamander War, Thrul bargained with Kossuth, god of fire, to aid the Red Wizards. Their victory led to the capture of the Priador and the appointing of Thrul as its tharchion. This led to a close alliance between Thrul and Mythalanir, high priest of Kossuths Flaming Brazier temple.
Aznar was credited with rediscovering the ancient Mulhorandi secrets for creating gemstone golems in 1368 DR, and set about building an army with which to conquer Rashemen. However, he underestimated how difficult it was to control these constructs. By 1372 DR, they were largely no longer under his control, and had spread out across the continent. His personal army also included the Sisters of Cyric, a regiment of Cyricist priestesses who rode into battle on black unicorns.
In the wake of becoming the tharchion of Priador, Aznar Thrul captured the former tharchion Mari Agneh and kept her as his slave and sexual play-thing. In 1375 DR, Mari was transformed by the blood fiend Tsagoth into his likeness and finally killed Thrul.
Aznar Thruls position as Zulkir of Evocation remained filled for a time.
