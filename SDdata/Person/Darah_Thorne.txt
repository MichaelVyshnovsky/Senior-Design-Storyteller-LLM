'''Darah Thorne''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage who laid claim to [[Herne's Wood]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Although warned to avoid Herne's Wood, the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] was forced to camp by its edge. Darah Thorne marshaled bloodforged forces against them, insisting on being given tribute in exchange for staying there, but the leader chose to fight instead.
