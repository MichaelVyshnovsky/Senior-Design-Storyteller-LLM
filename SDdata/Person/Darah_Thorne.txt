Darah Thorne was a bloodforge mage who laid claim to Hernes Wood in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Although warned to avoid Hernes Wood, the leader of the Legendary Campaign was forced to camp by its edge. Darah Thorne marshaled bloodforged forces against them, insisting on being given tribute in exchange for staying there, but the leader chose to fight instead.
