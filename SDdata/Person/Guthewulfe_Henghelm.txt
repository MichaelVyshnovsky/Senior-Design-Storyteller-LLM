'''Guthewulfe Henghelm''' was a traveling [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]] trader from the region of [[Icewind Dale]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Heh... I may not look the part, but a trader's heart I have. I enjoy barter, almost as much as the sounds and smells of the rivers I ply. Besides... townsmen merchants fear to cheat so fierce a man, you see? Hah-hah!''|Guthewulfe Henghelm}}

==Personality==
Guthewulfe was a friendly and boisterous man who eagerly invited strangers to share a drink with him. He participated in drinking competitions with anyone except [[dwarves]], due to the Stout Folk's resilience when dealing with hard liquor.

==Possessions==
The barbarian merchant carried a selection of quality iron arms to trade with, as well as a special barbarian drink called ''[[braehg]]''. Guthewulfe also wore an [[enchanted]] [[silver]] ''[[howling wolf charm]]'' that allowed him to summon a [[gray wolf]] ally. He won the magic charm from his cousin's husband in a drinking game and had been using it as a lucky charm since then. Guthewulfe was willing to bet the charm against a good competitive drinker.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the [[Legion of the Chimera]] assailed the [[Ten Towns]] and besieged the town of [[Targos]] with an army of [[goblin]]s. Guthewulfe traveled up the [[Shaengarne]] to trade with Targos and settled in the [[The Salty Dog Tavern]] for the winter months when the river was frozen over. When Guthewulfe entered Targos, he refused to aid the town's defenses and freeze up on the palisades. The result of the refusal was an order that forbade the barbarian to unsheathe his [[axe]] while within the walls of the settlement. Guthewulfe's code of honor demanded the he obey the promise he'd given.

The barbarian was merrily drinking when the goblins launched a surprise attack on the docks, avoiding the palisades and fortifications altogether. As the fighting raged outside, Guthewulfe refused to believe such preposterous claims that goblins were attacking the docks, as he'd not heard a signal horn from the palisades or defenders' call to arms.
