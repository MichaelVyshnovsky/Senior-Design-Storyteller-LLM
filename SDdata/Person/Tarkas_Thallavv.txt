'''Tarkas Thallavv''' was the Gemayor of [[Keczulla]] in [[Amn]] in [[1362 DR]] and secretly a [[Cowled Wizards|Cowled Wizard]].

==History==
Tarkas once was an administrator for the Vinson family, but while their influence dwindled, Tarkas's powers grew.

In [[1347 DR]], he was the ruler of the city of the Keczulla, which he helped to grow with the aid of the [[Tanislove]] family. A decisive gain for the city were [[Pulth Tanislove]]'s gem mines, discovered in [[1355 DR]].
