'''Lalaskra of Ormpetarr''', also known as '''"Leatherskin"''', was a priestess of [[Loviatar]] from [[Ormpetarr]] in [[Sespech]], living in the 12th century [[DR]].

==History==
Soon after [[Bredisker]] stole the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'' in the [[1177 DR|Year of the Majesty, 1177 DR]], he sold the holiest book of the faith of [[Ilmater]] to Lalaskra, an enemy of the [[Church of Ilmater|church]]. She wore the tome's hairshirt form constantly. 

Finally, with Lalaskra having removed it during a ritual in the [[1211 DR|Year of the Crimson Crag, 1211 DR]], the ''Tome'' was stolen by [[Athorton|an unknown thief]], who also managed to make off with the tome's covers, stored in a backroom in Lalaskra's quarters in a nearby temple. Incensed, Lalaskra whipped her Loviatan minions into a frantic search for the ''Tome'' all across the southern [[Vilhon Reach]] lands, though without success.

After some ten years, Lalaskra was the center of a feud between two lovelorn [[wizard]]s. They battled for her hand in marriage, but Lalaskra was killed in the cross-fire. Lalaskra's followers soon abandoned the search for the ''Tome''.

==Activities==
Lalaskra wore the ''Tome of Torment'''s barbed hairshirt form at all times in order to receive the spells it granted. She was willing to suffer the injuries it inflicted, and earned the nickname "Leatherskin" for her troubles. She removed it only during Loviatan rituals, in which she walked slowly past her followers as they scourged her as hard as they could.
