        "Activities": "Rinyon handled the day-to-day running of [[Merrymar's Merchandise]], the only general store in Shining Falls.",
        "Personality": "She was known to be confident and strong-willed, and felt her husband's get-rich-quick schemes, such as discovering the dwarven complex behind the [[Shining Falls]] waterfall, to be foolish.",
        "History": "In the summer of {{YearlinkName|1372}}, goods meant for Merrymar's Merchandise were raided on the road by bandits, thought to be [[orc]]s of the [[High Forest]]. Tragically, Blaz and Rinyon lost not only merchandise but also all four of their sons and three of their nephews, leaving the extended family decimated and the store understaffed. Rinyon and her two daughters were left to run it alone while Blaz went on the road as a merchant.<ref>{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"Extermination\" Plot Recap}}"
