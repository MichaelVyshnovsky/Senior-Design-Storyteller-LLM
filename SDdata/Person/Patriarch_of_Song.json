        "Description": "Despite being the highest ruler of his church, the identity of the Patriarch was a mystery to most people. He usually appeared as a male of venerable age with gentle features, knobby hands, a long white beard, and ice-blue eyes.",
        "Abilities": "The patriarch was amongst the best [[harp]]ists in the world. He was a wonderful singer, able to go from a deep and heavy voice to the clear high pitch of a young elven maiden.\n\nThe patriarch seemed able to change his appearance and gender, and would sometimes adopt new names, which contributed to the mystery surrounding his origins.\n\nHe was rumored to know a song so beautiful it would [[enthrall]] creatures listening to it, putting them in a trance during which they would only focus on the music soaring in their heads.\n\n[[Sorlyn]] believed that the Patriarch was immortal, and that as long as he lived music would flourish on [[Faerûn]].",
        "Possessions": "The Patriarch owned a house in [[Waterdeep]]. In addition, he was in possession of the [[Bellows of Milil]]—a powerful [[pipe organ]] housed in the [[Arbalest's House]] temple in [[Athkatla]].",
        "Activities": "In [[1358 DR]], Milil gave the Patriarch the task of overseeing the development of Arbalest's House, its most significant temple at that moment.",
        "Relationships": "While all churches paid heed to the Patriarch, his influence was stronger in [[northwest Faerûn]] and dwindled the further away one moved from Waterdeep. Distant congregations such as the ones in [[Sembia]] paid the Patriarch no more than lip service, and only paid attention to his most urgent communications."
