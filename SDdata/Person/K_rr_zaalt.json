        "Activities": "K'rr'zaalt's predecessor, a [[spirit naga]] chieftain, was slain by adventurers, leaving the Kron'ikl tribe in complete disarray. K'rr'zaalt had been taught the dogma of [[Shekinester]] and took control of the tribe when no other leaders stepped forward. K'rr'zaalt was affirmed several months later at a meeting of spirit naga chieftains. He later attended the same meeting, called the [[Great Conclave]], on a regular basis and was the only pterafolk in attendance. Many of the spirit nagas resented him for this and plotted to wrest control of the Kron'ikl from him.",
        "Possessions": "K'rr'zaalt wielded an enchanted [[heavy mace]] and [[heavy crossbow]]. He owned a ''[[cloak of resistance]], [[bracers of armor]]'', and two [[scroll]]s of ''[[cure moderate wounds]]''."
