Justyn Rassk was a butcher and representative of the Guild of Butchers in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
Justyn grew up in the toughest neighborhood in the Field Ward of Waterdeep, gaining many scars.
In 1492 DR, Justyn possibly went into business with the new owners of the Trollskull Manor.
Justyn disliked going to the North Ward and in that part of the city his heart was always full of resentment. He always tried to ask extra pay for delivering the guilds meats.
