The thuggish woman, part of a mercantile family, set her eyes on an upstart shop, Okuzos Imports, when it began dealing in perfumes and spices from the eastern lands of Kara-Tur. Dallia Urdo sought to squash the competition to the Urdo family business before Okuzo could grow and become a threat. Dallia attempted to buy Okuzos business out, but the Wanese merchant refused. Soon after, just a few days later, Dallia came to the store with her henchmen to intimidate Okuzo into selling. When Okuzo refused once again, she was backhanded with a ring-adorned hand of the thuggish Urdo scion, leaving the painful welt. The goons left but not before promising to return later to continue \"negotiations.\""
