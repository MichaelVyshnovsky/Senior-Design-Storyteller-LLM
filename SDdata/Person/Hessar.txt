Hessar was a Calishite human shade monk and member of the Eye of Justice in the late 15 century DR.
Hessar was muscular and had yellow eyes. He had a black moon symbol of Shar tattooed on his wrist and the Eye of Justices symbol of an eye and gauntlet tattooed on his palm.
Although he was a monk, he possessed some magical abilities.
Levia Shadewalker sometimes joked lustfully with Hessar about taking a step further.
Hessar kept his true nature hidden from most members of the Eye. Some who knew him suspected he was an agent of the shadovar, but in fact he was working for the vampire lord Kirenkirsalai. After he double-crossed Kirenkirsalai one too many times in 1480 DR, the vampire broke Hessars neck and left him for the newly made vampire Vaelis to feed on.
