'''Scarmar Heldeth''' was a mage from [[Athkatla]], working as a wizard-for-hire in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was extremely cautious, and got very skittish when things weren't perfect.

==Abilities==
He had at least one blasting spell, and one defensive spell that created a cloud of glowing dust around him.

==Possessions==
He carried a paralyzing wand, almost certainly a ''[[Wand of paralyzation]]''.

==Activities==
He was a wizard for hire.

==Relationships==
During the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, he was hired by [[Traevyn Illance]], but only for one evening.

==History==
Traevyn Illance hired him for an evening after the disaster in the [[Council of the Dragon]] of 1479 DR, to capture [[Rauligus Helderstone]]. Scarmar Heldeth, together with [[Morligul Downdagger]], assaulted the home where the man was staying, and took him captive; along the way, they also captured [[Storm Silverhand]] and slew everyone there, save for the [[War Wizard]] [[Reldyk Applecrown]], whose comatose body was actually harboring the mind of [[Elminster Aumar]].

However, knowing they had failed to capture or slay one of the people there, Scarmar Heldeth decided to flee the city, fearful of what the loose end may bring; he had already been paid, and was less trusting of Traevyn Illance's loyalty than his companion Downdagger was. He even cast a protective spell before leaving, not trusting Downdagger.
