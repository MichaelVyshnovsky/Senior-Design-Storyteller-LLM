        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Screeb and two of his drunkard friends stumbled across [[Mantides]], a disgraced [[paladin]] of [[Lathander]] who was drowning his sorrows in [[ale]] at Black Eye in Westgate's [[Harbor Loop]]. The drunkards accused Mantides of being a washed-out drunk, insinuated he lost his holy [[sword]] and that the [[Church of Lathander|church]] took Mantides's manhood when it stripped him of paladinhood. Despite harassment, Mantides did not stoop to violence. Screeb accused the ex-paladin of being a coward, and his group stumbled out of the tavern, leaving Mantides alone."
