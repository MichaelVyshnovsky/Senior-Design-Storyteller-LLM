Pallar the Obedient was a human man of the city of Procampur in the Vast.
He was a priest of Torm and was High Priest of the House of the Hand temple by 1358 DR, a position which he still held by 1367 DR. He had 26 subpriests and 48 lay-worshipers.
Priests of Torm ran Calispar Delgorth, a poison-dealing priest of Talona, out of the city early in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR. When Calispar later dealt with the Shadowkind assassins in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, he asked them to assassinate the high priest. The high priest is unnamed but presumed to be Pallar the Obedient due to the close dates. As this is an adventure module and the attack is contingent upon a successful demonstration of Calispars magic-resistant poison, which may be interrupted by player characters, the attack may not necessarily have gone ahead.
