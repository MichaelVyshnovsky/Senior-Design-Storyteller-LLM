        "History": "Arianna the Archer died many centuries before her grave was disturbed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their [[drow]] allies in [[1369 DR]]. Her body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside Magister [[Luther]], [[Erik Sliphand]], [[Sindar]], [[Bannoc]], and [[Shyla]]. Their final resting places were corrupted by the wild magics of the Weeping War. Arianna, and her crypt-mates became cursed with an [[undead]] existence as [[wraith]]s, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with."
