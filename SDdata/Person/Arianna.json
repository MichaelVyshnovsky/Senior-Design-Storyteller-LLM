Her body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside Magister Luther, Erik Sliphand, Sindar, Bannoc, and Shyla. Their final resting places were corrupted by the wild magics of the Weeping War. Arianna, and her crypt-mates became cursed with an undead existence as wraiths, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with."
