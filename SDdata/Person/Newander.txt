Newander was a druid of Silvanus at the Edificant Library in the Snowflake Mountains of Erlkazar in the mid–14 century DR.
Newander had blond hair.
The druid was a shy man who loved nature yet yearned for civilization at the same time, which aroused contradictory feelings in him regarding his faith. As a druid, he viewed the forest with love and wished to be as powerful as his friends, who had the ability to shape-change into various animals—an ability he had not yet developed.
In the , when the Edificant Library was assaulted by agents of Castle Trinity, Newander joined his friends Danica Maupoissant and Cadderly Bonaduce in battle against the cleric Barjin. Newander and Cadderly were the only ones not affected by Barjins Chaos Curse—potent magic that enhanced ones desires even until self-destruction. Newander resisted the curse to a high degree because his desires were contradictory and unclear even to the druid himself.
In the final battle with Barjin, the druid finally achieved the ability to shape-change into a great wolverine and sprayed Barjin with his musk. The musk disintegrated the mages enchanted robes and thus weakened his defenses to a point where Newanders friends could overcome the cleric. But before Newander could get away, Barjin killed him with his enchanted mace, the Screaming Maiden.
