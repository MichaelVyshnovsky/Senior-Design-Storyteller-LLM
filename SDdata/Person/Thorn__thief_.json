        "mainbody": "'''Thorn''' was a thief in [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Raven Express: They Deliver Messages - And More}}",
        "History": "One day, Thorn met [[Legov Nairb]], who was living on the streets after being evicted from the family home, and realized his power to control [[bird]]s with his ''[[ring of avian control]]''. Thorn allowed Legov to stay at his house and took a role as his mentor. They began to work together as thieves, using Thorn's skills and Legov's bird-control power to execute some significant thefts and getting rich.\n\nHowever, Legov tired of thieving after only a year, and started the [[Raven Express]] delivery business. Thorn persuaded Legov to use the [[raven]]s to smuggle goods as well, and found some thief acquaintances to run branch offices for Legov. Raven Express was active in the 1360s [[DR]]."
