'''Yasraena Dyrr''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] and the [[matron mother]] of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Yasraena was the granddaughter of the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow]] and sister of [[Auro'pol Dyrr]], who was matron mother until [[1358 DR]].

==History==
After Auro'pol's death, Yasraena was chosen by the Lichdrow to be matron mother.

In the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, during the [[Silence of Lolth]], House Agrach Dyrr entered into a secret alliance with the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], who had chosen that house because of its ''de facto'' male ruler, the Lichdrow Dyrr. In exchange for the assassination of Matron Mother [[Ghenni Tlabbar]], they worked with [[Nimor Imphraezl]] to betray Menzoberranzan's [[Army of the Black Spider]] to the armies of [[Gracklstugh]] and [[Kaanyr Vhok]]. Nimor posed as Captain "Zhayemd" of House Agrach Dyrr in order to complete the deception. After the house's betrayal was revealed, the house compound was besieged by [[House Xorlarrin]] and its allies. [[Gromph Baenre]] battled Lord Dyrr, destroying his corporeal form. Thus the defense of the house was for the first time truly in the hands of Yasraena and her daughters. However, Gromph infiltrated their compound in order to destroy the lich's [[phylactery]]. Destroying the phylactery activated the master ward, destroying the house temple and killing Yasraena.
