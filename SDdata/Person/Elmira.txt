'''Elmira''' was an elderly resident of [[Neverwinter]] who lived in the city's [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She saw through the rhetoric proclaimed by the "revolutionary group" known as the [[Nashers]], seeing them as little more than another gang that preyed upon the less fortunate.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Elmira saved up what money she could to hire adventurers to deal with the Nashers in her neighborhood. She wanted them to take back the goods that the Nashers stole from her fellow less-fortunate Neverwintan residents.
