        "mainbody": "'''Bawr''' was a pirate captain of the ''[[Narwhal (galleon)|Narwhal]]'' and a member of the [[Refuge Bay Trading Company]] who traveled between [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Chult]] ''circa'' [[1362 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''The only danger you've ever faced, Master Historian, was your patron's wrath at a bottle of spilled [[ink]]. Quiracus, take the old man down to the orlop, where he'll be quartered as surgeon for the voyage. Our ink-stained friend will be put in [[Nelock]]'s charge.''|Bawr}}",
        "Description": "Captain Bawr appeared to be a sweet and petite young woman\n\nShe wore expensive and beautiful black shoes and [[silk]] pantyhose, a white blouse, a white loose skirt,, delicate gloves, and a red hooded cloak.\n\nUpon her transformation into the lizard or dragon-like shape, her head became covered in hard ridges, her face shifted to remain that of a [[crocodile]], and red scales covered the entirety of her form. The snapping maw was filled with razor-sharp teeth. Her slender and petite appendages bulged with muscles become thick, like those of a [[mountain dwarf]]. Her body grew and ripped through most of the clothes she wore if the transformation was full.",
        "Personality": "Bawr was quickly bored by mundanity. Her voice turned from sweet to coldly malicious upon even a hint of insubordination or disagreement.\n\n\nShe kept a strict chain of command on her ship. She inspired awe, respect, and feat via her strange nature, and short-tempered outbursts. Bawr's crew often spoke of their Captain in hushed tones but always favorably. The crew witnessed Bawr terrifying transformations, triggered by anger, and tried to keep her in good spirits whatever the cost.\n\nShe trusted her first mate, Master [[Quiracus]], to run the ship during the day when she stated below the deck. At night, Bawr was helming the ship and could always be found on deck.",
        "Abilities": "Apart from Bawr's charisma, her main weapon was her mysterious [[draconic|dragon]] lineage. She could transform into her lizard-like terrifying red bulky humanoid, monstrous form when she was angry. Her attitude and anger levels were manifested in her growing in size and her skin turning reddish hue, only to grow red scales when she went into a rage.",
        "Possessions": "Captan Bawr was the owner of her ship, the ''Narwhal'' ever since she took it by force and until her demise in [[Aremag]]'s hungry maw.\n\nBawr liked to keep her cabin furnished and decorated gaudily. The cabin's centerpiece was an intricately woven expensive [[Turmish]] carpet.",
        "History": "Captain Bawr was a mysterious person. Not much of her past was known about her history. According to her loyal crew, the woman was a pirate active in the [[Inner Sea]] sometime before 1362 DR. She gathered manpower and vessels to build a small pirate fleet there. She had forcefully taken ''Narwhal'' from the hands of [[Cormyr]]ean Crown's Navy. Soon after, the resourceful woman stroke a deal with the [[Black Network]] of [[Zhentil Keep]]. Zhents provided Bawr with a labor of a group of strong but dimwitted [[giant]]s who carried ''Narwhal'' and her new crew from the land-locked Inner Sea to the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nGetting access to the vast open seas off the Sword Coast, Bawr's ship operated both as a pirate, and an expensive cargo vessel, member of the Refuge Bay Trading Company of Chult. The Trading Company used Bawr to transport trade goods to the Chultan coastal outposts and moved highly valued [[teak]] and [[ivory]] back to the Sword Coast.\n\nIn 1362 DR, two adventurers purchased a passage on Bawr's ship from Baldur's Gate to Chult. [[Artus Cimber]] and [[Hydel Pontifax]], members of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] in search of the legendary ''[[Ring of Winter]]''. Unimpressed with the passengers, Bawr ordered Pontifax to serve as the ship's medic and Cimber to serve under her third in command, Nelock. Unbeknownst to the two, Bawr also transported two more guests, villainous [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] and his [[wizard]] aide [[Phyrra al-Quim]], both of the [[Cult of Frost]] infamy. Kaverin influenced Bawr's first mate Quiracus to serve him and eventually steal ''[[Artus Cimber's journal]]'' and attempt to get the adventurer killed.\n\nCloser to the end of the voyage, off the shores of the [[Refuge Bay]], Bawr was confronted by a [[dragon turtle]] [[Aremag]] who demanded a tribute even though that was in violation of the agreement Bawr and the Refuge Bay Trading Company made with the creature. Angered, Bawr decided to feed Artus Cimber to the beast as part of a payment extorted by Aremag. That was due to Quiracus' manipulation, placing unwitting Artus in the way of the Captain's blind anger. Unfortunately for Bawr, Artus wore an enchanted [[Mulhorandi]] medallion at the time that housed a powerful ''guardian phantom'' [[Skuld (phantom)|Skuld]]. Triggered by the obvious threat to its Master, Skuld appeared just in time to be attacked by a fully transformed red draconic monstrous Bawr. The Captain was no match for the Mulhoradi spirit. She was tossed overboard, where Aremag happily swallowed her, accepting it as the part of the passage fee the dragon turtle demanded."
