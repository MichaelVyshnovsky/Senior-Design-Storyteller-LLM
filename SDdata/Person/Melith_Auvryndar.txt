'''Melith Auvryndar''' was a [[drow]] member of [[House Auvryndar (Menzoberranzan)|House Auvryndar]] in the drow settlement in the [[Sargauth Level]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Melith was frustrated to command only a few troops and to need to rely on T'rissa. For this, she welcomed [[adventurer]]s that could change the situation in the level.

==Activities==
Melith led the Auvryndar offensive inside the [[Twisted Caverns]] and was waiting to challenge the victor of the conflict between the local [[aboleth]]s and [[kuo-toa]]. Melith's strategy was to first destroy the kuo-toa and later eliminate the aboleth, however she commanded only a few [[drow]] troops and did not have enough soldiers for large-scale-attacks.

She was usually praying in front of a shrine of [[Lolth]] with her wife [[Thirza]] nearby.

==History==
Melith was a priestess of [[Lolth]] and a daughter of Matron Mother [[Vlonwelv Auvryndar]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} under orders of her elder sister [[T'rissa Auvryndar]] Melith lead a small Auryndar contingent inside the Twisted Caverns.

==Relationship==
Melith was in love with the drow mage [[Thirza]], who however was more interested in prestige than Melith's love.
