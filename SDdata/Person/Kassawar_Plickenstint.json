After 1371 DR, he was chosen as the representative of Luruar, but the deep gnomes there produced a smaller portion of goods than before. So Kassawar had little to do and spent a lot of his time just staring at nothing.\nKassawar greatly suffered for the loss of his home city and spent most of his time in mourning.\nCategoryClerics\nCategoryGnomes\nCategoryDeep gnomes\nCategoryWorshipers of Segojan Earthcaller\nCategoryInhabitants of Blingdenstone\nCategoryInhabitants of Mantol-Derith\nCategoryInhabitants of the Northdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Middledark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants\nryu4oucwg6kjohcpqx6ui43udb4n1yq"
