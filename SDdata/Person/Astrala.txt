Astrala, sometimes spelled Astralla, was a human waitress who served tables at the Golden Goblet Inn in Mossbridges in the late 14 century DR.
Circa the , Astrala was a tall young woman with long brown hair. She had an average appearance, somewhere between being attractive and plain.
She was familiar with a good half-orc fighter who occasionally visited the Goblet. The retired fighter, Chester Hearth, was notable to her because he paid with gems, instead of coins and was often accompanied by his guardian war dog named Suzzane.
The town of Mossbridges began growing after The Three Women War in the Vast. A new popular inn opened in the late 14 century DR, the Golden Goblet Inn, where Astrala found employment. She cheerfully greeted guests and offered them a table or a spot at the bar, where the inns owner, Georgio, served drinks.
