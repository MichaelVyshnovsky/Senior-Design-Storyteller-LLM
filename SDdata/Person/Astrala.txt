'''Astrala''', sometimes spelled '''Astralla''', was a [[human]] waitress who served tables at the [[Golden Goblet Inn]] in [[Mossbridges]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Astrala was a tall young woman with long brown hair. She had an average appearance, somewhere between being attractive and plain.

==Relationships==
She was familiar with a good [[half-orc]] [[fighter]] who occasionally visited the Goblet. The retired fighter, [[Chester Hearth]], was notable to her because he paid with [[gem]]s, instead of [[coin]]s and was often accompanied by his guardian [[war dog]] named [[Suzzane]].

==History==
The town of Mossbridges began growing after [[The Three Women War]] in [[the Vast]]. A new popular inn opened in the late 14{{th}} century DR, the [[Golden Goblet Inn]], where Astrala found employment. She cheerfully greeted guests and offered them a table or a spot at the bar, where the inn's owner, [[Georgio]], served drinks.
