        "Description": "Dimon had fairer skin than most [[Mulan]]. Blue veins showed across his shaven head. He wore the black gauntlet emblematic of his order.",
        "History": "Around [[1373 DR]], Dimon decided to convert to the faith of Bane.\n\nDimon housed the council of [[zulkir]]s during the war of Thay in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. During one of their meetings, Dimon was attacked by the bored [[Nevron]], who conjured an [[advespa]] to kill the priest. Suddenly, Bane took possession of his worshiper and endured the attack of the devil, in the end killing it with Dimon's hands. Bane encouraged the zulkirs to fight [[Szass Tam]] again at the [[Keep of Sorrows]] under cover of the magic-crippling effect of the [[Spellplague]]. However, after the god disappeared, Dimon died from the wounds inflicted by the advespa."
