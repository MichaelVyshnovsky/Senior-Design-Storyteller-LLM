Tethka was a githyanki warrior in training from Crèche Yllek, on Toril during the late 15 century DR.
Tethka had a gaunt gith body and long light brown hair. She wore a set of githyanki-crafted half plate.
Tethkas people, the gith group that would become Crèche Yllek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Tethka, loyal to her Kithtak, was a warrior in training who was to become a sarth, leading her kin into battle. She and several of her kin ventured into the nearby shadow-cursed lands, where they encountered a corrupted spirit of nature Thaniel who forced them to play games with him and his shadows and ended up killing Tethka and others.
