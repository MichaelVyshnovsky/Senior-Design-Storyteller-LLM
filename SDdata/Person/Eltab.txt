'''Eltab''' was a [[demon lord]] known as the "Lord of the Hidden Layer."

==Description==
Eltab appeared as a fifteen-foot-tall humanoid with the head of a canine-like creature. His head sported numerous antlers and horns and his body was covered with bony dark red plates. He had slitted yellow glowing eyes.

==Realm==
Eltab ruled the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 248: The Hidden Layer|248{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]] known as the Hidden Layer. It was a vast wasteland of boulders and fissures constantly beset with intense electrical storms, making it inimical to most life except for [[demons]] and deadly [[plant creature|plant]] life such as [[viper tree]]s, [[ironmaw]]s, and [[bloodthorn]]s. In the fifteen centuries or so of Eltab's absence, the Hidden Layer was fragmented into ever-changing fiefdoms as Eltab's former lieutenants, including the balor [[Ndulu]], fought over the vacated realm.

Thanks to the bindings cast by the [[Narfell]]i [[demon]]-binders on Eltab when they summoned him, they also somehow linked fragments of the Hidden Layer to [[Faerûn]], as well. Pieces of the layer, known as [[demoncyst]]s, could be found scattered beneath the ground all over [[northeast Faerûn]]. The largest cyst, known as the [[Hall of the Hidden Throne]], lay in the [[Citadel of Conjurers]]. This cyst contained Eltab's palace and the calling circle that tied Eltab to the Realms. In fact, until this circle is destroyed, Eltab could not leave [[Faerûn]] or return to the Abyss.

==History==
The demon lord Eltab was a potent force in the Abyss, rivaling the powers of [[Graz'zt]], [[Orcus]], and even [[Demogorgon]] himself. However, during the ancient days of Faerûn, the empires of [[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]] engaged in a bitter war ({{Yearlink|-623}} to {{Yearlink|-150}}), which ultimately destroyed both empires. During this war, Eltab was summoned to Faerûn by the so-called demon-binders of Narfell, so he could be used as a pawn against their hated enemy. In {{Yearlink|-148}}, Eltab led a demonic horde on the behalf of Narfell and invaded [[Raumathan]], a city of [[Rashemen]], which he quickly conquered and set up himself up as its ruler.

Eltab's rule was brief, as an alliance of spellcasters (including the [[Witches of Rashemen]]) overthrew Eltab in {{Yearlink|-75}}. Eltab was forced to flee, but the Rashemi witches caught up with him in the [[Sharawood]], imprisoning him beneath the ground, and bound a [[dracolich]] called the [[Everlasting Wyrm]] to guard over him.

In [[106 DR]], followers of the dark god [[Myrkul]], intending to plunder the hoard of the Everlasting Wyrm, discovered the imprisoned demon lord. They agreed to release Eltab under the condition that he serve Myrkul's church for ninety-nine years. With Eltab's aid, the followers of Myrkul took control of the city of [[Shandaular]] and in its place, established the theocratic city of [[Eltabranar]].

Later, in [[202 DR]], Eltab prompted an ill-fated invasion of the nations of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]]. Eltab was once again imprisoned, this time by the god-kings who led Mulhorand, in a demoncyst beneath [[Thaymount]].

The infamous [[Red Wizards]] found Eltab more than seven hundred years later, in [[922 DR]]. The wizards used an ancient Narfelli demon-binding ritual and called Eltab forth to assist them in their war with the Mulhorandi god-kings. The god-kings' armies were routed and the nation of [[Thay]] was established. When the Red Wizards found they could not dismiss Eltab, they imprisoned him near the mouth of the [[River Eltar]], which was named after the demon lord, and built a capital city named [[Eltabbar]] over the prison.

Eventually, the Thayan lich [[Szass Tam]] realized that Eltab would soon break out of his prison. Instead, in [[1367 DR]], he deliberately released Eltab with the intention of using a spell to permanently enslave the demon lord. But his plan was foiled by a group of adventurers, allowing Eltab to escape into a demoncyst below Thaymount.

During a retaliatory confrontation with Szass Tam in [[1373 DR]], Eltab was seemingly destroyed, but thanks to the binding cast on him by the ancient Narfelli demon-binders, he was magically transported to the [[Citadel of Conjurers]] in the nation of [[Impiltur]], where he plotted new plans for conquests and revenge.
