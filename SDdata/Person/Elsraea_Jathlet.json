        "mainbody": "'''Elsraea Jathlet''' was the matriarch of the [[Jathlet]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. She inherited the reins of the family business after her husband, \"Happy\" [[Jolthur Jathlet]], died in a riding accident of dubious cause. However, her position was mostly honorary because Jolthur had many brothers and uncles who were already actively conducting independent business for the family (and themselves) and she was greatly outnumbered in a male-dominated clan."
