Hulmarra Murnyetha was a beautiful Rashemaar tracker who lived in Rashemen during the 12 century DR.
Hulmarra was killed by a Red Wizard from Thay. After her death her spirit would often visit Mosstone within Immil Vale, perhaps because she was fond of the location during her life. She would interact with anyone camping at Mosstone, even going so far as to steal away with men who reminded her of her long-dead husband. The men would reappear years later without having aged a day.
