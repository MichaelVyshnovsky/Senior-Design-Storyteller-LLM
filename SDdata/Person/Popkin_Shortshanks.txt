|Things went fine in the beginning, just the usual undead problems you find in tombs. But then I found a secret door leading down into an underground cave complex.
|Popkin}}

==Description==
Popkin was a pale-skinned woman with bright green eyes and reddish-brown hair kept tied back. She wore mismatched [[hide armor]].

==History==

|There were all sorts of things down in the caves, and we got ambushed. The group was split up during the fighting. I managed to escape out a side passage, but afterwards I couldn't find any of the othersâ€¦
|Popkin}}
Around the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Popkin and her fellow [[adventurer]]s [[Jarus Brithandir|Jarus]], [[Helayna]], [[Liantor Stoneborn|Liantor]], [[Kirina Aelorothi|Kirina]], and [[Tristran]] discovered an [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|ancient tomb]] at the bottom of a crevasse in the Stonelands. They fought their way past some [[undead]], and found a hidden passage leading deeper underground. The group pressed on boldly, but were ambushed and overwhelmed by the [[kobold]]s of [[Clan Daeronnax]]. The fighting separated all the members of the group, and though Popkin escaped she was unable to find her friends again or fight past the threats that filled the caves.

She returned to Eveningstar in search for help, and received a number of magical trinkets that contained ''[[word of recall]]'' spells keyed to Eveningstar, from a "[[Elminster|nice old gent with a weird hat]]" that she met in town. She looked further still for someone to deliver the enspelled trinkets and save her friends, and found some capable adventurers that were willing to help. She shared what she knew of the situation and directed them onward in her [[ox]]-pulled [[cart]], anxiously waiting to see if any of her friends lived.

Although Liantor Stoneborn had already been killed, thanks to Popkin's actions her other four companions were able to be rescued and safely recovered from the caves. This even included Tristran, who had been kept for a snack by the [[red dragon]] [[Daeronnax]].
