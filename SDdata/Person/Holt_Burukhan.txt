'''Holt Burukhan''' was the high priest of [[Bane]] in [[Sundabar]] in [[1373 DR]].

==History==
In 1373 DR, Burukhan was approached by [[Kaanyr Vhok]], leader of the [[Scoured Legion]], who asked for the help of the local [[Church of Bane]] to overthrow [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]]. Burukhan was not fully convinced and waited for a better evaluation of the situation, but his underling [[Zasian Menz]] joined Kaanyr.
