Holt Burukhan was the high priest of Bane in Sundabar in 1373 DR.
In 1373 DR, Burukhan was approached by Kaanyr Vhok, leader of the Scoured Legion, who asked for the help of the local Church of Bane to overthrow Helm Dwarf-Friend. Burukhan was not fully convinced and waited for a better evaluation of the situation, but his underling Zasian Menz joined Kaanyr.
