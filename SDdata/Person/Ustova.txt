Ustova was a stone giant librarian living in Gravenhollow in the late 15 century DR.
Ustova was the most reserved of the librarians there.
Ustova spent all her time in meditation, sensing visions of the future that she transcribed on stone tablets. She kept a special eye on the futures of all giant communities in the Underdark, hoping to maybe see a clue to rebuilding the once-great giant civilization.
