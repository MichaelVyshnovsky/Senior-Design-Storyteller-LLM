'''Ustova''' was a [[stone giant]] librarian living in [[Gravenhollow]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Ustova was the most reserved of the librarians there.

==Activities==
Ustova spent all her time in meditation, sensing visions of the future that she transcribed on stone tablets. She kept a special eye on the futures of all [[giant]] communities in the [[Underdark]], hoping to maybe see a clue to rebuilding the once-great giant civilization.
