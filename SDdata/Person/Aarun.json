        "mainbody": "'''Aarun''' was a [[Harper]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1485 DR]].",
        "History": "Aarun was a member of the Harpers based in [[Ten Towns]]. In 1485 DR, he grew suspicious about [[Vaelish Gant]] and his minions. Aarun discovered that Vaelish's minions were [[wererat]]s of [[Ship Rethnor]] and contacted fellow Harper [[Emryn Dawe]] in [[Luskan]], requesting [[silver]] weapons. Emryn promised to send them in the next shipment but, in the meantime, Vaelish discovered Aarun's true nature. He faked a letter from [[Mithann]], leading him into an ambush, where he murdered Aarun."
