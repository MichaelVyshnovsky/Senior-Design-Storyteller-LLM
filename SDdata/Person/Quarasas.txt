Quarasas was a manggus that lived in a palace at the very top of the Mhahasaratsu Shan, on the eastern edge of the A-Ling Shan.
Quarasas regularly took sacrifices, offered to him on altars found all along the paths that went near the Mhahasaratsu Shan, by those who lived near the mountain. He also occasionally kidnapped people that wandered near his mountain. According to local superstition, this was typically done during terrible blizzards.
Quarasas was watchful and wary of any strangers that came near his mountain, using his shapechanging powers to investigate them.
Over the years Quarasas grew very powerful, though complacent.
In 1359 DR, Quarasas came to the conclusion that it was about time he raised a new generation of mangguses. He plotted to take the fairest maiden he could find, though repeatedly he found many of the locals to not satisfy his tastes.
Those who lived around the Mhahasaratsu Shan claimed that the spirits voice was supposed to be golden and irresistible, describing it as the "music of the mountain".
