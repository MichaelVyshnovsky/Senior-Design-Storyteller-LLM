Mirea Sain was a seasoned hunter operating out of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
She was a woman of few words.
Mirea was a member of the Hunters Guild of Chult, and took an active role in acquiring equipment&mdashparticularly leather armor&mdashfor the guild. She could often be found at Hunters Square in Port Nyanzaru as she planned her hunts and purchased lures.
During the events of the death curse Mirea contacted Port Nyanzarus Master of the Market in order to find a leatherworker who could fashion durable equipment out of manticore hide.
