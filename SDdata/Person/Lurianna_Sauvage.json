The werewolf and the vampire spawn became lovers. When, in 1492 DR, Cazador Szarr decided to perform a ritual that would elevate him to being a vampire ascendant, Antwun was ordered to become part of the ritual. However, Dufay knew of what would happen to him in the ritual and made a plan to avoid that grim fate. He purchased a potion from Bonecloaks Apothecary that would knock the imbiber out, giving Dufay the appearance of death and to make sure the illusion was believable, he also purchased lookalike potions of acid poison.\nIt was unknown if Antwun Dufay consumed the potion and outlived his master. By the time the ritual began, his body was found in the Szarr Palace, showing evidence of acid poisoning, implying he accidentally drank the wrong vial. Lurianna Sauvage, was not informed of the her lovers plan as he was unsure if she could be trusted not to betray him to Cazador. When Lurianna found her beloveds body, she wrote a goodbye note and drank another deadly potion, following Dufay into the afterlife. He body was turned to slush from the inside by the poison."
