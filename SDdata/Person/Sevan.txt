Sevan was a wealthy merchant from Amnwater in Amn.
After the sinking of Valashars Bane in 389 DR, a pair of fishermen from Teziir recovered the Cormyrean sword of state Ilbratha and sold it to Sevan. Sevan took the sword with him on a trade caravan to Scornubel, via Traders Road and the Chionthar river. In Scornubel, Sevan sold it to another merchant, Phelas Urm.
