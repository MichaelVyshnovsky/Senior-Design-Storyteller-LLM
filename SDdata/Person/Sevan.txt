'''Sevan''' was a wealthy merchant from [[Amnwater]] in [[Amn]].

After the sinking of ''[[Valashar's Bane]]'' in [[389 DR]], a pair of fishermen from [[Teziir]] recovered the [[Cormyr]]ean sword of state ''[[Ilbratha]]'' and sold it to Sevan. Sevan took the sword with him on a trade caravan to [[Scornubel]], via [[Trader's Road]] and the [[Chionthar]] river. In Scornubel, Sevan sold it to another merchant, [[Phelas Urm]].{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}
