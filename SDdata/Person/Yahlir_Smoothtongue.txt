'''Yahlir Smoothtongue''' was a [[honey]]-tongued adventuring [[bard]] and a historian, active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Yahlir had a light heart, glib tongue, and light feet.

==History==
Yahlir claimed to have earned his [[bard]] title at a court in the Snowhigh Towers. No one knew of the place's existence, as it was likely completely fictional. By the age of twenty-two, Yahlir was known for being too brash and too boastful, uncharacteristically for a bard from any court in [[Faerûn]]. Despite that, Smoothtongue had a vast knowledge of history, lore, and songs. He valued ancient art and jewelry above all else. Yahlir made a living as an adventurer and a mercenary archeologist because being a poet paid little.

Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Yahlir Smoothtonguet was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths.
