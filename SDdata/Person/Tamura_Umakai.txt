Tamura Umakai was a wu jen of Fochu Peninsula in Wa. 
Tamura Umakai was the shoya of the village of Ikizawa in Fochu Peninsula.
Umakai trained under the powerful wu jen Setsu Iki.
In 1357 DR, after years of not seeing him, Setsu arrived in Ikizawa asking Umakai to take care of a page of the fabled Book of Hsi. Setsu explained that the evil Za-Jikku from the Qui demiplane wanted the book but it was safest being split in two, with a page in the far and isolated Ikizawa.
However, in 1358 DR, the yellow-robed minions of Za-Jikku twice attacked the village, greatly scaring Umakai and his villagers.
Later he met Osari Minhiro and a foreign adventuring party. After checking that they were good men, Umakai told them everything and gave them the page of the Book of Hsi.
