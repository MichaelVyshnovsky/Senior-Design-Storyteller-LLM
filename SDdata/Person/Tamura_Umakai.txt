'''Tamura Umakai''' was a [[wu jen]] of [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]]. 

==Activities==
Tamura Umakai was the [[shoya]] of the village of [[Ikizawa]] in Fochu Peninsula.

==History==
Umakai trained under the powerful wu jen [[Setsu Iki]].

In [[1357 DR]], after years of not seeing him, Setsu arrived in Ikizawa asking Umakai to take care of a page of the fabled [[Book of Hsi]]. Setsu explained that the evil [[Za-Jikku]] from the [[Qui]] [[demiplane]] wanted the book but it was safest being split in two, with a page in the far and isolated Ikizawa.

However, in [[1358 DR]], the yellow-robed minions of Za-Jikku twice attacked the village, greatly scaring Umakai and his villagers.

Later he met [[Osari Minhiro]] and a foreign adventuring party. After checking that they were good men, Umakai told them everything and gave them the page of the Book of Hsi.
