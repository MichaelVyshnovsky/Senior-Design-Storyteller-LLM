'''Temmenische''' was a [[monk]] and a member of the [[Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred]] at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]] in the 13th and 14th centuries [[DR]].

==History==
Temmenische was born ''circa'' [[1264 DR]].

In the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], Grand Master [[Poke]] died suddenly. This necessitated that [[Kane]], a Master of Spring and next-in-line for the position of Grand Master, hurry back to the monastery and manage affairs until a new Grand Master could be trained and selected. However, Kane had no wish to remain in the position. Temmenische was the next most senior monk, but at 95 years of age, he was hardly a practical choice.

Thus Kane and Temmenische chose [[Cantoule]], who was much younger and more suitable, to succeed Poke as Grand Master. They put Cantoule through accelerated training in advanced techniques to ready him for the post.
