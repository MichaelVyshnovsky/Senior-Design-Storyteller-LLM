King Javilarhh "the Dark" Snowsword III was a king of Delimbiyran in the 7 century DR.The existence of Javilarhh III is somewhat vague, as he is referred to without a regnal number, shares his nickname with Javilarhh I, and lived within the same century as Javilarhh II. While the father of Erthaer Javilarhhsson could be an extraordinarily long-lived Javilarhh II, it is considered more likely that there were three Javilarhhs and a reused nickname.
Javilarhhs ancestor was King Javilarhh Snowsword II, and he had several children, with the later King Davyd Snowsword being his grandson. His youngest son was Erthaer Javilarhhsson.
