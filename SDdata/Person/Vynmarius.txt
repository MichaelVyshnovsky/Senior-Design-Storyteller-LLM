Vynmarius was an open wizard, as well as an agent of the Council of Six, who lived within the city of Athkatla around the year 1370 DR. While his service to the Council, along with his freedom to practice the arcane in Amns capital, was well known, Vynmarius allegiance was also rumored to extend to the enigmatic Cult of the Dragon.
Despite the openness Vynmarius enjoyed as a mage who practiced within the city, he emanated a presence of suspicion and hostility.
