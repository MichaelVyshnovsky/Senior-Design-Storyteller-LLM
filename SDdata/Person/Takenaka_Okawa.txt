Takenaka Okawa was the shikken of Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Okawa became shikken in 1349 DR after the conclusion of the Hojo War, where the Takenaka clan gained supremacy over the Hojo clan, putting a puppet shogun on the throne. However, Takenaka Sugawara, the true military leader of the war, couldnt ascend to the shikken position because he was of no blood relation to the shogun, a trait possessed instead by his half-brother, Okawa.
Okawa was reserved and aloof, ambitious and very able in manipulate others. He was able in administrative works but not an inspired military leader or a good diplomat. Okawa considered Sugawara only a jealous man and was divided by the necessity to keep united his clan and frustration for Sugawaras actions against him
