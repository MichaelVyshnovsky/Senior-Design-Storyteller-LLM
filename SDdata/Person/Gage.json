However, he didnt care for righting wrongs.\nHe was also inordinately tenacious, following Kiril even though she warned him not to on pain of death, even across the Yuirwood, Sildëyuir, and even the Underdungeon of Stardeep, all while staying hidden.\nHe was, however, genuine enough to recommend Kiril avoid restoring her bond to Angul.\nPer Kiril Duskmourn, Gage fought \"like a wildcat\", disabling foes quickly, even trained knights. He was also a sure-footed and excellent climber. Despite his differences with his possessed glove and his poor treatment of it, he consistently got it to do what he wanted, even though he had to threaten the demon with acid sometimes.\nGage made use of alchemical equipment such as inhalant, alchemical lights and even explosive bulbs on occassion.

When Kiril learned Gage had been hired to steal her blade, she parted ways with him Gage decided to follow her anyway, from a distance, and hidden.\nGage crossed the same portal Kiril had used, but was delayed in following by two nilshai attacking him. He used the Hands of Paymon to track Kiril through Sildëyuir and into the Underdungeon, where he was attacked by a stone spider and lost the enchanted glove after using an explosive to attack the spider, which loosed the demon. He took the opportunity to flee when the spider came back up to attack the demon.\nEventually, he crossed the Empyrean Knights again.

After helping strike down the keeper, he revealed himself to Kiril, and they were back on good terms."
