        "mainbody": "Martin von Mensch was the  ex-adventurer owner of Conyberry Arms within the village of Conyberry.\nNever content with just ripping off his customers, Martin enjoyed creating items which would break and selling them at market prices. Martins endeavors all revolved around looking only for new means to increase his hoard of treasure and wealth. This included having an invisible thief walk around his store adding to his ill gained fortune. \nAround 1367 DR, Martin decided to have an invisible thief to walk around with a ring of invisibility stealing small objects off unsuspecting customers in the shop. During this time villagers guessed at possible identities of the thief, one included a famous Waterdeep burglar who was taken in by von Mensch, because he permanently caused himself to be invisible."
