'''Miri Shokiro''' was a [[warrior]] from [[Kara-Tur]], whose life was largely lost to the sands of time by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Be the sand, and nothing but time will take you. The rocks must become it, the waves and wind must bear it, and those who would hold it find it slips through their grasp. Always some trace in a faraway nook, if never the whole is seen again.''|Miri Shokiro's philosophy}}

==History==
Even though most of Miri's legacy was forgotten, the philosophy that defined her life was still remembered by sages as of the late 14{{th}} century DR. Another piece of her legacy were the [[enchanted]] [[shuriken]]s that once were part of Miri's armory â€“ ''[[Grains of Sand]]'', found on the [[Sword Coast North]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}
