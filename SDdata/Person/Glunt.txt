Glunt was a negligent Watchguard in the city of Westgate in the late 14 century DR.
Glunt was a human guard with yellow-hued skin creased with age and bright red hair. He wore a set of chainmail armor of the Watchguard and was armed with a sword and a shield.
In the , Glunt was stationed in the Market Triangle of Westgate when a seemingly abandoned building exploded. Nonplussed by the pyre, Glunt was focused on removing a piece of stringy meat from his teeth with his grimy hands. When confronted about his ignoring the explosion, the Watchguard stated that the home was abandoned with no one hurt inside and that the fire was not spreading. He hoped to find some piece of wood loosed by the explosion to fashion a toothpick. Glunt had no interest in venturing into the "deathtrap," claiming that even if someone were inside, theyd be already long dead. Instead, Glunt "actively monitored the situation" on behalf of the guard. In reality, the building was not abandoned, and it served as the hideout for wizard Uzalimon, who led a clandestine war against the cultists of the ancient lich Kokrulobis.
