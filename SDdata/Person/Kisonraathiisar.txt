'''Kisonraathiisar''' was a [[topaz dragon]] and the first king of [[Westgate]]. He founded Westgate in an effort to build a kingdom that would survive the effects of the [[King-Killer Star]].

==History==
He was slowly destroyed by [[Saldrinar]] "of the Seven Spells", a [[Netherese]] wizard, in {{Yearlink|-349}}.<ref> Saldrinar then became the first [[human]] king of Westgate.

Kisonraathiisar's corpse was kept in a secret subbasement below [[Castle Thalavar]] in Westgate.
Early in his reign, [[Orlak]] took a large chunk of bone from the skeleton of Kisonraathiisar and from it carved a special chalice. With unholy incantations of [[necromancy]], Orlak enchanted this as the ''Argraal of Orlak''.

Long after his death, a large stature (not to scale), was erected in Westgate to commemorate the creation of the city and its first draconic king. The statue depicted Kisonraathiisar as a fierce [[red dragon]] and was placed in the [[Harbor Loop]] with a plaque that named the creature, his death date, and his slayer â€“ Saldrinar. As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the stature to Kisonraathiisar stood unvandalized.
