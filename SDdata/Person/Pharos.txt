Pharos was the most powerful elven high mage among the elves of Tethir, Darthiir Wood, and Shilmista and the one who trapped the genies Calim and Memnon in the Calimemnon Crystal and ended the First Era of Skyfire. He became a baelnorn and guarded over the Crystal for nearly 9,000 years.
As of 1374 DR, Pharos still resided in the Spinning Keep of Siriwadjen. He cast illusions and set traps throughout the Keep to prevent anyone from ever finding the Crystal.
