{{quote|Ma and Pa left me in charge.|Pitney Junior}}

==Description==
As a child, Pitney Junior Lannon was much taller than his peers. He liked to appear tough and serious. He had short dark-brown hair and dark blue eyes.

==Relationships==
Pitney Junior was a son to [[Ginni Lannon]] and [[Pitney Lannon]], two soldiers and defenders of West Harbor. He had several younger siblings, including [[Kyl Lannon|Kyl]], [[Kiri Lannon|Kiri]], and [[Kaye Lannon]], as well as two much older siblings.

==History==
After the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, soon after the [[Mere of Dead Men]] was briefly consumed by a short but deadly conflict known as the [[Second War of the Shadow]], Kyl's parents volunteered to go on a rescue mission to retrieve the village [[mage]], [[Tarmas]], from the lair of [[black dragon]]s [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]]. Pitney Junior was still too young to understand the danger, but he was left in charge of his younger siblings, a job that he took seriously.
