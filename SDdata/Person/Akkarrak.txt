'''Akkarrak''' was a [[deinonychus]] [[animal companion]] of [[Clawkeeper Kzheemoc]], a beastmaster of the [[Batiri]] [[Shattered Spear tribe]] in [[Chult]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==Description==
Akkarrak was a lean long-bodied bipedal [[dinosaur]] with intimidating-looking talons on its toes. Its hide was brightly colored, reminiscent of an exotic [[bird]].

==History==
In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, the Shattered Spear tribe discovered the shipwreck of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' on [[Omgar's Teeth]]. The vessel belonged to [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] and her trade company. The Batiri attacked surviving sailors and passengers, including the infamous writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Some of the survivors ended up captured by the [[goblin]]s along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by [[Ghzermag]], Clawkeeper Kzheemoc, and [[Shoudul of the Skulls]]. Volo tried to persuade charming locals to let the survivors go, but Volo was not as fluent in [[Goblin language]] as he claimed to be. In the ensuing fight, Clawkeeper Kzheemoc, Akkarrak, and their kin were slain.
