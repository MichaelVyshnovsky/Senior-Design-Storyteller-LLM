Usamah was a human corsair living on the various lands of the Great Sea in 1367 DR.
Usamah was both the nakhuda and rubban of his sailing vessel. This was a source of great pride for him.
Usamah owned leather armor +2, a figurine of wondrous power (marble elephant), and a scroll of protection from fire.
