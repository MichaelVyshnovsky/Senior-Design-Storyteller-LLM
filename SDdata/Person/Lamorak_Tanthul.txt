'''Lamorak Tanthul''' was one of the [[Princes of Shade]] that ruled over the city of [[Thultanthar]] within the returned empire of [[Netheril]] throughout the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].
{{Quote|Have no fear, we will honor the promise. With your permission, we will do even more. We will help you destroy the [[phaerimm]].|Prince Lamorak, to Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]].}}

==Description==
Unlike some of his more imposing brothers, Lamorak had a lead appearance with a rather gaunt visage. He had eyes that resembled rust-covered [[iron]] and long, talon-like fingers.

This was not Lamorak's true appearance however. Like his brothers, all that remained of the [[shade]]-prince's mortal form was a beating black heart set within a rib cage and adjoining spine, the bones of each appeared entirely black. Lamorak's [[humanoid]] appearance was composed of mere wisps of shadow.

==Personality==
He held no strong loyalties amidst the politics of Thultanthar, believing it best that his father the High Prince Telamont Tanthul utilize manipulation to deal with anyone that perceived themselves as his enemy. He preferred to abstain from any outright hostilities.

==Possessions==
Prince Lamorak's personal sigil was a white skull outlined in black on a light gray field.

==Activities==
Selected by his father Telamont to administrate the [[Determinists' Guild]], Lamorak and his fellows administered tests to each and every [[shadovar]] to ensure they could best serve Thultanthar, the City of Shade.

Additionally he was also charged with overseeing the selection process that determined which of the city's shadovar residents were worthy enough to be transformed into [[shade]]s.

==Relationships== 
Lamorak had two sons, [[Tantoras Tanthul|Tantoras]] and his younger brother [[Draethren Tanthul|Draethen]], a sorcerer of some skill in Thultanthar. Lamorak killed his elder son for plotting against his grandfather, staging his death to appear as an accident.

==History==
When the Princes of Shade [[the Return|returned]] to [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Lamorak appeared alongside his brothers [[Brennus Tanthul|Brennus]] and [[Yder Tanthul|Yder]] before the [[Bedine]] people traveling along the [[Shoal of Thirst]] in [[Anauroch]]. They attempted to win over the nomadic people but were mistaken for [[djinn]] or other fiends by the superstitious locals.

By [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Lamorak had returned to Thultanthar alongside brothers Brennus and [[Rivalen Tanthul|Rivalen]]. The following month in [[Mirtul]], Lamorak and [[Clariburnus Tanthul|Clariburnus]] met with Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]] to offer Thultanthar's support the [[Army of the North]], as they marched in relief of the besieged [[elven]] city of [[Evereska]]. The Shadovar princes were dedicated to eradicating their ancestral foes, the recently-released aberrations known as the phaerimm.

Within hours, the Shadovar withdrew their support from the [[Heartland Alliance]] and abandoned their allies on the battlefield, leaving them vulnerable to a phaerimm counterattack. Lamorak returned with Clariburnus and other fellow princes to Thultanthar, to consult with their father, the Most High [[Telamont Tanthul]]. Telamont directed Lamorak to form a treatise with the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], and garner new allies for Thultanthar.
