Neyobu was an ensorcelled panther companion of Ras Tfima, once the barae of Ubtao and a gem mage in the mid-14 century DR.
Neyobu was a big cat with night-black fur, with deadly fangs and big razor-sharp claws. It had lightning-fast reflexes.
The panther had three enchanted pearls affixed to the forehead in a shape of a triangle with blueish white sparkles jumping from one gem to another. The magic pearls granted the cat powers, longevity being one of them.
Even though Neyobu was a dangerous and fearless beast, it followed Tfimas will and commands. The cat was playful and even gentle with allies like Negus Kwalu and Alisanda Rayburton, and an intense sentry guarding its master from strangers.
Loyal companion of Ras Tfima, the cat lived together with the gem wizard in his sprawling hut on a riverbank, surrounded by natural and chiseled stone, granite, limestone, slate, shale, and other more exotic rocks.
In 1362 DR, Neyobu was living with its master outside of the magic walls of Mezro in Chult. During Artus Cimbers expedition to Chult in search of the Ring of Winter, Cimber and Alisanda sought Ras Tfimas aid in rescuing Dhalmass Rayburton, captured by the Cult of Frost and the Batiri. The black cat guarded its master from the stranger - Artus, while letting the barae through into the sorcerers hut. During that visit, Neyobu pounced up onto the huts roof like black lightning, instantly slaughtering Feg, the flying monkey spy of the Cult of Frost.
