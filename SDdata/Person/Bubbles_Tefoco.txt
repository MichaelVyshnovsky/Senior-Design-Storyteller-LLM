'''Bubbles Tefoco''' was the oldest daughter of [[Oliver Tefoco]], the proprietor of the [[Beehive Goods and Wares]] general store in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Bubbles was a daughter of Oliver and [[Kroyce Tefoco]], mother of [[Dorimara]], and a sister to a number of siblings. The older siblings were: [[Dariel Tefoco]], who served the [[Flaming Fist]], [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]], and [[Crowell Tefoco|Crowell]], who were training as caravan guards. The youngest siblings [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]], [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]], and others still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened Baldur's Gate's safety, Bubbles lived outside the Lower City walls in the [[Stonyeyes]] neighborhood and gave birth to Dorimara, who became the first granddaughter of Oliver Tefoco's. As the city became closed off in fear of the cultists, Bubbles received a letter from Oliver Tefoco with several [[coin]]s he sent over for her to buy a cute hat for the newborn. The grandfather could not wait to visit but was worried about the closed-off city gates and burdening his daughter, who had just given birth.
