'''Boward''' was an agent of the [[Harpers]] that operated out of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She played an important role in coordinating the response against the emergent [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Abilities==
During the campaign against the cult, Boward dispatched adventurers to deal with cult-aligned dragons that appeared in various locales across [[the North]], including [[Roth√© Valley]], the [[Ebon Downs]] cemetery in the [[Silverwisp Swamp]], the [[Whispering Caverns]], and even far-off [[Icespire Peak]]. She also helped rally the defense of Neverwinter when dragons assailed the city,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 6}} responding to the dragon [[Charthraxis]] that attacked [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath graveyard]].

She worked with various [[adventurer]]s to outright slay any cult members they encountered.

==History==
When the Cult of the Dragon became active across the [[Sword Coast]] during the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Boward began to recruit volunteer adventurers at [[Neverwinter/Protector's Enclave|Protector's Enclave]] in Neverwinter. She gained more information from her fellow Harper agent [[Windle]], and informed adventurers about the ongoing schism of the cult, specifically the rise of [[Severin Silrajin]] within the organization.

Boward followed the Cult of the Dragon's trail as they sought out the final resting place of the [[barbarian]] [[Cruven Gantara]], as part of their effort to access the [[Flame Fault]] on [[Tuern]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 5}} [[Dragonsoul]] [[Malthus]] sought to converse with the spirit of Gantara's former companion companion [[Belast Messandar]] at Neverdeath Graveyard. Fortunately, Malthus and his fellow cultists were thwarted by Boward and her new ally, the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].

Despite their best efforts the cult finally managed to open a ''[[portal]]'' to Tuern.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 2}} In response, Boward orchestrated the [[Five Factions]]' efforts to take control of the ''portal'' in [[Icewind Dale]]. A group of heroes including [[Alaeros Margaster]], [[Barrowin Undurr]], and Boward's fellow Harper [[Nymmestra Durothil]] fought a terrible battle against the cult, but proved successful in the end. When the Cult of the Dragon struck back against the allied forces, Boward then coordinated the factions' defense of the ''portal'', preventing it from falling into the cult's possession once again.

When it became apparent that the Cult and their [[Red Wizard]] allies led by the [[Thayan Resurrection|renegade]] [[Rath Modar]] were close to summoning [[Tiamat]] at [[Tiamat's Temple|her temple]] at the [[Well of Dragons]], Boward took immediate action. She tasked some adventurers with infiltrating the cult's compound and stealing Red Wizard supplies to gleam more information about their involvement.
