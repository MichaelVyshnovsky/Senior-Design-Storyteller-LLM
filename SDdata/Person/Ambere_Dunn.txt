'''Ambere Dunn''' was a woman who lived in the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the unhappy and heavy-drinking wife to [[Tybald Dunn]] and mother to [[Hailee Dunn]].
{{quote|''Tybald's wife...?! Ha! I sleep under his roof at times, but am I his '''wife'''? In name only... Ha! May his innards freeze and his body be buried in one of his [[barrel]]s... I bear NO love for that scarecrow of a man. He dragged me here, to the North, to NOWHERE, so he could try to make a few coppers, and I could freeze and die... what a '''fool''' I was.''|Ambere Dunn}}

==Description==
Ambere was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone and long golden hair.

==History==
Tybald Dunn and Ambere married a number of years before somewhere south of Icewind Dale. Eventually, the couple moved to the frontier town of Lonelywood, as Tybald promised his wife a "bright new future." However, she and Tybald had a hellion of a daughter. Ambere spent her days drowning her misery at a frozen hell of a home, dead-end husband, and unruly daughter in drinks at [[The Whistling Gallows]] inn. She was sleeping around, throwing herself at visitors and caravaners who passed through the town in hopes that one of them would take her away from this life. Despite being bedded by several men who promised her an escape, Ambere was left behind by every single one of them.

When a [[barbarian]] army threatened the [[Ten Towns]] in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, a group known as the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]] arrived in Lonelywood to deal with the danger. By some accounts, the heroes met the Dunn family and subsequently managed to convince Ambere to reconsider her plans of escape and to rethink her priorities, putting effort into her family. It was also possible that the heroes saw Ambere and her drinking habits as detriments for her family and convinced her to flee Lonelywood on her own and start a new life somewhere else, to Tybald's dismay.
