Ambere Dunn was a woman who lived in the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR. She was the unhappy and heavy-drinking wife to Tybald Dunn and mother to Hailee Dunn.
Ambere was a human woman with a light skin tone and long golden hair.
Tybald Dunn and Ambere married a number of years before somewhere south of Icewind Dale. Eventually, the couple moved to the frontier town of Lonelywood, as Tybald promised his wife a "bright new future." However, she and Tybald had a hellion of a daughter. Ambere spent her days drowning her misery at a frozen hell of a home, dead-end husband, and unruly daughter in drinks at The Whistling Gallows inn. She was sleeping around, throwing herself at visitors and caravaners who passed through the town in hopes that one of them would take her away from this life. Despite being bedded by several men who promised her an escape, Ambere was left behind by every single one of them.
When a barbarian army threatened the Ten Towns in the , a group known as the Heroes of Icewind Dale arrived in Lonelywood to deal with the danger. By some accounts, the heroes met the Dunn family and subsequently managed to convince Ambere to reconsider her plans of escape and to rethink her priorities, putting effort into her family. It was also possible that the heroes saw Ambere and her drinking habits as detriments for her family and convinced her to flee Lonelywood on her own and start a new life somewhere else, to Tybalds dismay.
