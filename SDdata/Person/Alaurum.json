        "mainbody": "'''Alaurum''' was a powerful [[archmage]] of the world of [[Toril]] and one of three persons responsible for creating the [[World Serpent Inn]], according to the [[wizard]] [[Elminster]].",
        "Relationships": "Very little is known about Alaurum&mdash;not even race or gender are known&mdash;except that the mage was friends with a member of [[Arcane (race)|the Arcane]] named [[Ilyndele]]. The two, together with the [[illithid]] High One [[Sharth]], are said to have \"crafted\" the inter-planar inn.",
        "History": "Hundreds of years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Alaurum, Ilyndele, and Sharth built the inn itself. The [[demiplane]] within which the inn resided&mdash;and the plane's many portals&mdash;had already existed, supposed by some cosmologists to be a [[dreamscape]] resulting from a sleeping fragment of the [[World Serpent]]."
