While digging, he extensively discussed the subject of Tessarils exact relationship to the king, explaining to his fellow Highknights that Lord Tessaril was close personally with Azoun, and that he was certain of her loyalty. He later spotted that he was being scried on by Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle, and warned his fellow knights to fetch a War Wizard."
