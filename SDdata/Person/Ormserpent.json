These reptiles would be spawned in groups of between three and six, which never contained more than two of each kind. It was rumored that if the Ormserpent were to spawn another Ormserpent in this manner, the original would die.\nTales also circulated about a group known as the \"Daughters of the Ormserpent\". These female-only beings were supposedly vomited out by the Ormserpent only rarely, and were said to be immune to all forms of poison, were able to shapechange into snakes of various sizes, and possessed significant intelligence and determination.\nFinally, the Ormserpent was said to be the subject of a cult."
