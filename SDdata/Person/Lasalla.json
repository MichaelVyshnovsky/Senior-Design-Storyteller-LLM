        "mainbody": "Lady '''Lasalla''' was a noblewoman from the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Why must this inn always be crowded with brainless debutantes? Have you seen Alicia?''|Lady Lasalla}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Lady Lasalla frequented an expensive and exclusive [[Mithrest]] inn in [[Athkatla/Center District|Center District]]'s grand [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. She found herself scoffing at the young debutant â€“ [[Alicia Paalater]], who was being aggressively courted by predatory Count [[Claylan]], like he did Lady Lasalla in the past. The Count spent a week with young Lady Lasalla and left her heartbroken after growing bored with her. She believed that Alicia was foolish and naive to show interest in Claylan, who was seducing and using \"idiot girls\" routinely while being married himself. Lasalla planned to have Count Claylan's [[wine]] to be mixed with slop water."
