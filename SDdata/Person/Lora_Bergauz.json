        "mainbody": "'''Lora Bergauz''' was a retired sailor and a patron of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''A hag has her? Gods above. What does a hag want with Vanra? My poor child...''|Lora Bergauz}}",
        "Description": "Lora was a [[human]] woman with freckled bronze skin, blue eyes, and red hair. She wore a commoner's garb and carried a [[quarterstaff]].''",
        "Abilities": "Lora was a [[cleric]] who followed a [[deity]] of the [[light domain]]. As a priest, she had access to such [[spell]]s as ''[[guiding bolt]]'', ''[[sacred flame]]'', and ''[[spirit guardians]]''. As a cleric of light, she could ''[[channel divinity]]'' into a ''[[radiance of the dawn]]''.",
        "Posessions": "Lora's small home was located in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, not far from the Blushing Mermaid and the docks. Apart from a quarterstaff, Lora owned a unique and powerful [[rapier]] she received from her famed mother – ''[[Duellist's Prerogative]]''. She also wore a potent [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] – the ''[[amulet of Windrider]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Lora's mother was ''[[Lenore the Fleet]]'', a duelist and a sailor, whose name came from her legwork in battle and not from her naval skills. Lora's daughter was [[Vanra Bergauz]], still a child in the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "Lora Bergauz retired to the city of Baldur's Gate with her daughter after selling her ship – ''[[Starborn]]'', a three-masted [[gaff]], a Valor-class vessel, five-gun sixth rate. Despite its damaged condition, with two of the five guns broken, Lora received a bid of 10,000 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] from an anonymous buyer.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the time [[Captain Grisly]] was replaced by the [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Lora's seven-year-old daughter mysteriously disappeared during an evening of drinks there. When she came to her senses, Vanra was missing, and everyone at the Mermaid seemed to believe that the girl never existed and Lora was there alone, meeting and drinking with friends. Distraught and desperate, Lora tried to threaten the bar staff with a [[dagger]], but no one believed her story. She eventually attempted to report the disappearance to [[Liara Portyr]] at the [[Basilisk Gate]] barracks. The [[Flaming Fist]] Blaze's investigation uncovered a lead. Still, when Lora arrived at the barracks, Liara Portyr seemed unable to focus on the problem and talked in circles, not willing nor able to comprehend the crime, as if some mind-magics afflicted her. She may have gotten lucky coming across the group called the [[Absolute Adversaries]], who offered to help the distraught mother.\n\nVanra Bergauz, still a child, was captured by Captain Grisly, or more precisely, Auntie Ethel, and consumed as a grim act of [[hag]] procreation. The heroes could've decided to save the child and, by using the ''[[hag's bane]]'' [[potion]], extracted the child alive and unharmed from the hag's belly. By other accords, Vanra was rescued, but the adventurers failed to save the child's life, breaking Lora's heart. And the last possibility was the \"heroes\" taking a grim or cruelly utilitarian approach and allowing the hag to gestate the child into a new hag in exchange for Auntie Ethel's help in defense of the Gate during the War with the [[Absolute]]."
