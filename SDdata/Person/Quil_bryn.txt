Quilbryn was a mad drow in Szith Morcane in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Quilbryn was a member of the Drow Resistance against the invading fire giants. However, he was infected by a kind of hedonistic madness and murdered the archmage Solom Nedrazak.
Afterward, Quilbryn, despite the objections of Murssvayas Dhuurniv, tried to convince all drow to abandon Szith Morcane.
In his madness, Quilbryn wanted to live again in a great drow city, with many slaves at his disposal, focusing only on enjoying life.
