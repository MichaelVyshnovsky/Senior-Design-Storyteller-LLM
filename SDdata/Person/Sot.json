He and the cook would always reach instinctively for their cudgels when trouble was brewing at the inn.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Laughing Goblin Inn\nCategoryInhabitants of Phlan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Moonsea\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInnkeeps\nfa4tbxkd53of7zfi1ulbnkbe6ytafnc"
