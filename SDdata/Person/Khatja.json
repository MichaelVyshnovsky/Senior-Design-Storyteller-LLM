        "Description": "Unlike her mate, Khatja was a chaotic woman who venerated the ferocity of [[barbarian]]s. Khatja wielded her giant two-handed [[broadsword]] in battle.",
        "History": "Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Khatja, along with her mate [[Geldin]], joined the Lady's Lament and quickly gained respect for their strength. The couple rarely talked about their past, but one thing was known about them - they have been ostracised by both [[human]]s and [[orc]]s alike.\n\nIn 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from [[Luskan]] to the besieged city of [[Targos]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]."
