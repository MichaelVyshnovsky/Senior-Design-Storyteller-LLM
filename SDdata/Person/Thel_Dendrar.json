        "mainbody": "'''Thel Dendrar''' was a woodcarver that lived in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was a courageous man, and the only resident of Phandalin to stand up to the [[Redbrand]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Thel was the patriarch of the Dendrar family. He had a wife, [[Mirna Dendrar|Mirna]], and two children, [[Nars Dendrar|Nars]] and [[Nilsa Dendrar|Nilsa]].\n\nHis woodworking shop was located in central Phandalin.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the local bandits of Phandalin gave sly and suggestive looks to Mirna, Thel's wife. The Redbrands had been terrorizing the village for some time, and the townmaster, [[Harbin Wester]], was too intimidated to do anything. Thus, Thel approached the bandits alone in this cause. This did not go well, and he was murdered.\n\nThel's corpse and his family were taken to [[Tresendar Manor]], the ruffians' base. Thel was thrown into the caverns beneath the manor and fed to a [[nothic]], whilst his family were put into a slave pen."
