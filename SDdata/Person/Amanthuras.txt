'''Amanthuras the Benificient''' was a [[human]] [[proxy]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[power]] known as [[Ilmater]]. He was considered to be among the foremost of Ilmater's regular stable of proxies.

==Description==
Amanthuras was typically dressed in gray [[robe]]s, along with a blood-red [[skullcap (cap)|skullcap]] and blood-red cords wound around his wrists.

==Activities==
This proxy traveled to wherever his [[cleric]]al services were most needed. This could include [[Toril]], the world of Ilmater's worshipers, or even the planar city of [[Sigil]].
