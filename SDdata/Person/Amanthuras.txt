Amanthuras the Benificient was a human proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Ilmater. He was considered to be among the foremost of Ilmaters regular stable of proxies.
Amanthuras was typically dressed in gray robes, along with a blood-red skullcap and blood-red cords wound around his wrists.
This proxy traveled to wherever his clerical services were most needed. This could include Toril, the world of Ilmaters worshipers, or even the planar city of Sigil.
