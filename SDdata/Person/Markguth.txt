Markguth was a human guard and the sergeant of the guards in the small town of Greenest, located in the Western Heartlands in west Faer√ªn.
During the battle with the Cult of the Dragon, Markguth was among the defenders of the keep. When he saw that Langdedrosa Cyanwrath had captured his sister and her children, he offered to be the citys champion against the half-dragon.
