Donnor Kerth was a knight of Lathander.
Donnor was trained in the ways of Lathander by Grayth Holmfast as a member of the Order of the Aster.
When in 1374 DR Grayth died during the feyri invasion of Evereska, Donnor went in search of Araevin Teshurr in order to know exactly how and why Grayth died. After listening to the story, he decided to join Araevins party in order to finish what Grayth had started.
