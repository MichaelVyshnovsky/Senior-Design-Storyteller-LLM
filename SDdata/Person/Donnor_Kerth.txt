'''Donnor Kerth''' was a knight of [[Lathander]].

==History==
Donnor was trained in the ways of Lathander by [[Grayth Holmfast]] as a member of the [[Order of the Aster]].

When in [[1374 DR]] Grayth died during the [[fey'ri invasion of Evereska]], Donnor went in search of [[Araevin Teshurr]] in order to know exactly how and why Grayth died. After listening to the story, he decided to join Araevin's party in order to finish what Grayth had started.
