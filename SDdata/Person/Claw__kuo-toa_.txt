The '''Claw''' was a male [[half-fiend]] [[kuo-toa]] and the leader of a small sect of kuo-toa in the [[Shrine of the Claw]] on the [[Lake of Shadows]].

==Description==
Unlike others of his kind, the Claw's teeth protruded from his mouth and his eyes glowed with an unearthly radiance. A row of sharp spines ran down the length of his back, giving the Claw an altogether fearsome appearance.

==Personality==
The Claw was a hateful and boastful creature that could not abide air-breathers or surface-dwellers. The few times he would deign to converse would be to preach death to his opponents or brag of his might. A discerning and patient combatant, however, the Claw would try to lead foes into open water where he could outmaneuver them or call upon his [[fiend]]ish [[kraken]] ally.

==Abilities==
Trained in the arts of an [[assassin]], the Claw could administer lethal and precise strikes against unprepared enemies. Adept with either the [[pincer staff]] of the kuo-toa or a stealthy dagger, the Claw was agile and canny enough to mix and match his fighting style to prey on an opponent's weaknesses.

Furthermore, the Claw was a devotee of [[Umberlee]] and could call upon [[divine magic]] skilfully enough to ''[[silence]]'' other casters or create rolling banks of ''[[fog cloud|fog]]''. He also had limited control over [[water elemental]]s.

Due to his [[demon]]ic heritage, the Claw was notably tougher and more powerful than others of his kind. He could even bring forth dark powers such as ''[[desecrate]]'' and ''[[unholy blight]]'' and was resistant to acid, cold and fire.

==Possessions==
Like other kuo-toa whips, the Claw was versed in, and carried, a [[pincer staff]]. He also had an ''[[assassin's dagger]]'' and carried ''[[potion]]s of [[invisibility]]'', which could both be employed to get close to an enemy. 

Furthermore, the Claw had collected a large quantity of offerings from his followers at the Shrine of the Claw, including thousands of coins, a ''[[Cli lyre]]'', a ''[[lyre of building]]'', and a few [[wizard]] [[spells]].

==Relationships==
The Claw was considered the intermediary between the kuo-toa of the [[Lake of Shadows]] and the fiendish [[kraken]] that controlled the Lake. This position earned him the devotion of the kuo-toa and he was considered the leader of the Shrine of the Claw. This enabled him to incite the kuo-toa into raids against the nearby [[stone giant]]s.

==History==
Born from the union between his kuo-toa mother and [[hezrou]] father, his unusual heritage made him an appropriate candidate as the liaison between the fiendish kraken and the kuo-toa in the Lake of Shadows.

By [[1372 DR]], the Claw had begun inciting his kuo-toa followers to attack the nearby stone giant tribe on the shore of the Lake of Shadows.
