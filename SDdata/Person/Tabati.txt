'''Tabati''' was a female [[invisible stalker]] inhabiting the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[east Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Adventure Book|5-6}}

==Description==
Tabati stood 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall.

==Activities==
Tabati was tasked by the [[sha'ir]] [[Raja al-Sadiq]] with recovering a unique seal and killing whoever possessed it. Raja provided Tabati with a brief description of the beggar who stole the seal, but Zakhara was filled with plenty of individuals matching the description. By chance Tabati spotted the seal in the possession of [[Adil al-Muluki]] in [[Muluk]] and immediately slew him and grabbed the seal.
