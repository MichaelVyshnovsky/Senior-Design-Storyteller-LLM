Tabati was a female invisible stalker inhabiting the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Tabati stood 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall.
Tabati was tasked by the shair Raja al-Sadiq with recovering a unique seal and killing whoever possessed it. Raja provided Tabati with a brief description of the beggar who stole the seal, but Zakhara was filled with plenty of individuals matching the description. By chance Tabati spotted the seal in the possession of Adil al-Muluki in Muluk and immediately slew him and grabbed the seal.
