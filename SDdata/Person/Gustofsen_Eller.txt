Gustofsen Eller was the most renowned planar expert in the Realms in 1357 DR.
In his youth, Gustofsen witnessed his entire family slaughtered by cultists of Kali, a goddess of another plane.
Around 1357 DR, Gustofsen proclaimed he had killed the goddess Kali in her layer on the Abyss. An adventuring party was assembled in order to accompany Eller to verify this. 
Gustofsen was obsessed with defeating Kali. He was a somewhat arrogant individual.
Gustofsen taught his second cousin Inata Eller.
