Evren Feray () was a diviner as well as the chief navigator and sailing master of a caravel that operated out of Ayakar in Turmish, and throughout the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Evren kept a number of maps that detailed notable locations across the Sea of Fallen Stars.
She was a trusted advisor to Captain Lazlo Sharktooth.
Some time during or after the , Captain Lazlo and his crew took on a job to uncover the whereabouts of Zehira Deryan. During their journey, Evren performed a divination ritual in an attempt to discern Zehiras exact location.
