Daeclander Illance was the head of House Illance in the late 15 century DR.
His retinue of armsmen and announcers had matching horses.
According to Arclath Delcastle, Daeclander arrived early to court events he could not afford to ignore, because he needed time to sample the luxuries on other and had much shady business to attend to before the War Wizards and highknights started eavesdropping on him.
He was married to Velyandra Illance. He had at least nine children, the oldest of which was Rothglar Illance.
Daeclander and his retinue arrived at court in Mirtul of the , during preparations for the Council of the Dragon. They were spotted by Arclath Delcastle and Delnor from the door of the Dragonriders Club.
