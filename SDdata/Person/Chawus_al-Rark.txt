'''Chawus al-Rark''' was a wealthy merchant and smuggler inhabiting the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] in [[north Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Chawus made his fortune in the wilds of far northern Zakhara. He had a deal with the [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] of the [[Corsair Domains]] where he helped them smuggle their goods into Utaqa in exchange for the corsairs agreeing to cease attacking any ships flying Utaqa's colors.

Chawus was also an advisor for Caliph [[Agara al-Gandar]].
