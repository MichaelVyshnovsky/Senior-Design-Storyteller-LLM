        "History": "Fylo was a priest of [[Bane]] who led the [[Zhentarim]] delegation in the reconstruction of Nesmé in the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]]. Secretly, however, Fylo went to deal with the [[fire giant]] [[Gundahella]]. Gundahella promised the liberation of a [[Zhent]] agent prisoner inside [[Ironslag]] fortress in exchange for support from the Zhents in stopping good groups like the [[Lords' Alliance]] for interfering with research on a fragment of the [[Vonindod]]."
