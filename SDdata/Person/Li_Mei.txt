Li Mei was a lover of an infamous monk from the nation of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, named Jade Panther, active some years before the late 14 century DR.
Li Mei was responsible for the disappearance of the bloody fighting implement that gained the monk his infamy. With time, Li Mei grew disgusted with the monks cruelty and stole the Claws of the Jade Panther, the monks gloves affixed with razor-sharp blades to savage his opponents. Li Mei tasked one of her servants with destroying the enchanted gloves, but instead the Claws ended up on the black market.
