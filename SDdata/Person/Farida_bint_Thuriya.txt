Farida bint Thuriya was a moralist and an ambassador of the Pantheist League.
Farida was known to be a very passionate and holy crusader for the Pantheist League.
In 1367 DR, Farida was a member of the royal court of Rogostos khedive, Samia al-Said, acting as a representative of the Pantheist League. During this time she was known to pay adventurers for whatever treasures they found out in the uncharted wilderness of the Ruined Kingdoms, after which she would arrange to have them smuggled out of Rogosto.
Farida was distrustful of Rogostos laymen mages and weak priests, believing that they inherent power within the city should not rest in their hands.
