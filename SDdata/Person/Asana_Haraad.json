        "History": "She would often save the lives of the starving citizens. In the late 1360s [[DR]], she stole money from Balthazar's mercenaries, and they threatened to publicly execute her. She begged to be spared, but ultimately regretted nothing. Asana may have been saved by [[Gorion's Ward]], with ''[[Montolio's cloak]]'' being his reward."
