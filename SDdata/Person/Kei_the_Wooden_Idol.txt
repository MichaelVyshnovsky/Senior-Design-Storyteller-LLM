'''Kei the Wooden Idol''' was a [[half-elven]] [[rogue]] [[adventurer]] and a member of the [[Annals of Halgren]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Being a rogue, Kei was armed with [[dagger]]s and a [[shortbow]]. She possessed a pleasant and affable personality sharing jokes and jigs with her comrades at arms. Kei liked to sneak out at night to feed her curiosity over what rich merchants had in their stock. In battle, she often stayed away from the front lines.

==History==
Kei was a mysterious youthful-looking woman who always raised eyebrows when she shared the stories of her past. Kei the Wooden Idol told tales claiming that once she was nothing but a sculpture carved out of wood. By some mysterious means, the idol was granted life and sentience. Kei spent some time adventuring, evident by many stories she accumulated over the years. The half-elf often exchanged one of her wild tales for a hearty meal at a tavern.

In the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Kei the Wooden Idol found herself in the northern city of [[Luskan]], where she joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries, and the rogue happily joined.
