'''Dralas''' was an [[undead]] [[human]] warrior and assassin from [[Thay]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a servant of [[Szass Tam]] and [[Sofina]] of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}
{{quote|You look older, Yendar. Must be all that foul mortal blood.|Dralas to Xenk}}

==Description==
Being undead, he had pallid and scarred skin. As a Thayan, he was bald with his scalp adorned with [[tattoo]]s, including the mark of Szass Tam. He wore ornate black [[armor]], and a hooded [[cloak]] to conceal himself.

==Possessions==
He wielded a [[sword]] with branching blades and used a [[spyglass]] and [[satchel]].

==Abilities==
He could ignite his sword with the spell ''[[green-flame blade]]''.

==Relationships==
Dralas was an old enemy of the Thayan [[paladin]] [[Xenk Yendar]], with the two likely having clashed before.

==History==
[[File:Honor Among Thieves - Sofina, Dralas, and Blackwood.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Sofina and Dralas meet and share their secret plans.'']]
In [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Sofina sent for Dralas and his band of six fellow warriors after she discovered the [[wild shape]]d [[Doric]] spying on her and [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] in [[Castle Never]]. Arriving by boat on the [[Neverwinter River]], they met Sofina at the docks. Sofina ordered him to hunt down and kill [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], and [[Simon Aumar]]. But first, she wanted Dralas to dispatch [[Blackwood (soldier)|Blackwood]] and his Neverwintan guards because they'd failed to stop Edgin and Holga's escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly.

Later, Dralas and his men caught up to Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric, who'd been joined by Xenk Yendar, as they rode through the [[Dessarin Hills]] and [[Kryptgarden Forest]], though he could only watch them through his spyglass from atop a high bluff nearby. The assassins climbed steathily down after them and tracked them through the [[Underdark]] all the way to their destinationâ€”the ruins of [[Dolblunde]]. Dralas and Xenk confronted and taunted one another, but the paladin handily took down the whole squad of assassins, as his companions provided a little aid
