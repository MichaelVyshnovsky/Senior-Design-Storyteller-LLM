Dralas was an undead human warrior and assassin from Thay in the late 15 century DR. He was a servant of Szass Tam and Sofina of the Red Wizards of Thay.
Being undead, he had pallid and scarred skin. As a Thayan, he was bald with his scalp adorned with tattoos, including the mark of Szass Tam. He wore ornate black armor, and a hooded cloak to conceal himself.
He wielded a sword with branching blades and used a spyglass and satchel.
He could ignite his sword with the spell green-flame blade.
Dralas was an old enemy of the Thayan paladin Xenk Yendar, with the two likely having clashed before.

In Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR, Sofina sent for Dralas and his band of six fellow warriors after she discovered the wild shaped Doric spying on her and Forge Fitzwilliam in Castle Never. Arriving by boat on the Neverwinter River, they met Sofina at the docks. Sofina ordered him to hunt down and kill Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, and Simon Aumar. But first, she wanted Dralas to dispatch Blackwood and his Neverwintan guards because theyd failed to stop Edgin and Holgas escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly.

Later, Dralas and his men caught up to Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric, whod been joined by Xenk Yendar, as they rode through the Dessarin Hills and Kryptgarden Forest, though he could only watch them through his spyglass from atop a high bluff nearby. The assassins climbed steathily down after them and tracked them through the Underdark all the way to their destinationâ€”the ruins of Dolblunde. Dralas and Xenk confronted and taunted one another, but the paladin handily took down the whole squad of assassins, as his companions provided a little aid
