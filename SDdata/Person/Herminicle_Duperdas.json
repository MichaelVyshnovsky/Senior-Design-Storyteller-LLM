        "mainbody": "'''Herminicle Duperdas''' was a novice [[mage]] from [[Heliogabalus]] in [[Damara]] who later became a [[lich]].",
        "Description": "When he became a lich, he was described to be an emaciated, skeletal creature, covered in withered skin. He wore tattered black robes and had a rotted brown lipless face.",
        "History": "Herminicle was a middling [[wizard]], whom many of his fellow students considered a novice.\n\nHowever, the novice wizard came across a [[Zhengyi]]an relic, a [[magic]]al tome of creation. He eagerly read it, and the book consumed him, taking his life force. The book bound him to a tower, which was a construct of Zhengyi.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Artemis Entreri]] infiltrated the tower, and confronted the lich. Herminicle engaged the two sellswords in battle, shooting green bolts of energy from his bony fingers at them. The lich's unlife was dependent on a conduit: a skull-shaped artifact inside the original tome that bound his life force to the Zhengyian construct. On Jarlaxle's command, Entreri grabbed the skull gem with the [[gauntlet]] that accompanied the sword known as [[Charon's Claw (sword)|Charon's Claw]], eventually breaking the conduit and causing the tower to collapse. As a result, Herminicle was defeated."
