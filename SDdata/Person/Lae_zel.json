        "mainbody": "'''Lae'zel''' was a [[githyanki]] soldier from [[crèche K'liir]] who was unwaveringly loyal to [[Vlaakith CLVII]], the god-queen of her people. After suffering an attack from [[mind flayer]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], she embarked on a quest to reunite with her people on the continent of [[Faerûn]] on [[Toril]].{{Cite web/BG3 Character Sheet - Lae'zel}}\n\n{{Quote|Lae'zel: passions of the heart and the blade wage war in her soul.|[[Orin|Zethino]], the [[dryad]].}}",
        "Description": "{{Quote|Zorru was right. Yellow as a toad, and twice as ugly.|The tiefling [[Damays]].}}\n\nThe githyanki had distinct black facial features, including a thick black underline and several spots. Lae'zel had a single, long scar that ran from her forehead, along the left side of her slight nose, and down to the bottom of her lower lip. She had pulled-back dark red hair and wore heavy mail. She weighed {{SI|143.3|lb|k}}.\n\nShe was considered a child still among her people.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|I am unfamiliar with the - well, I shall not say 'culture'. 'Custom', perhaps. You will educate me on matters of this Fay-run.|Lae'zel.}}\n\nLae'zel appeared to be wholly dedicated to the service of Vlaakith CLVII, the Undying Queen of the githyanki. She did not care for forming genuine relationships with others of her kind. Despite her singular devotion, she had a curious mind, one that led to her explore and better understand the strange land in which she found herself. Her greatest desire was the pursuit of truth of her people, and delivering it all for them to bear witness.\n\nLae'zel dreamed of becoming a githyanki ''kith'rak'', riding atop her own [[red dragon]] mount to carry out Vlaakith's will.\n\nWhile she was supremely confident in her own martial abilities, Lae'zel had the tendency to not allow herself to depend on others. She was exceptionally stubborn and seldom listened to others who had wisdom and knowledge that extended beyond her own life experiences. Furthermore, she expressed some sentiments of xenophobia, believing githyanki indoctrination that their people were more disciplined, and far superior to other races found across the [[Cosmology|cosmos]].",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|I know only blood-red and death-black. My mind is silver and my body steel. I am what I must be, say what I must be, to survive every beast I face and every wound I bear.|Lae'zel, on how she views herself.}}\n\nAs a soldier, Lae'zel possessed great strength and was exceptionally athletic. She was a skilled warrior, and was considered fierce even by the high githyanki standards. The young gith warrior mastered a battle stance called Hrath ajak, which is a unique technique from her crèche\n\nLike other githyanki, Lae'zel possessed some [[psionic]] powers. She could ''[[mage hand|move and manipulate small objects]]'' with the power of her mind at will. Similarly, she had an inherent resistance to psionic attacks.",
        "Possessions": "Lae'zel armored herself in a suit of [[githyanki half-plate]] armor, and preferred to wield a [[greatsword]] in battle. She kept with her a set of [[dragonchess]].",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|Countless scholars roam the [[Astral Sea]] and beyond - observing the ways of our lessers, exploring planes so distant, order turns to chaos and cold fires rage...The githyanki possess an eternity of knowledge, yet we still collect more. Infinities upon infinities.|Lae'zel, discussing her people.}}\n\nLae'zel devoted a lot of her youth in her combat training as a young warrior, and eliminated three young peers who dared to challenged her from the same crèche. She also spent quite some time in the library in crèche K'liir, learning much knowledge about worlds and planes beyond her crèche, pursued her goal of ascending within the githyanki military hierarchy.",
        "History": "{{Quote|Would that I were dont battle up there, among the Tears...Watch the moon cross the sky. The Tears follow behind it. Rocky bodies rumbling through the Sea of Night. One of them is my crèche: K'liir|Lae'zel.}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lae'zel embarked from [[crèche K'liir]] after Vlaakith directed her servants to find a unique artifact known as the ''[[Astral Prism]]'', which was taken to the third planet in the solar system that remained in [[Realmspace]]. She was unfortunately taken captive by a [[mind flayer]] and was forced into a holding pod inside a unique [[nautiloid]]. An illithid inserted an illithid tadpole into her eye. Soon afterwards, the nautiloid was attacked by githyanki dragon riders and severely damaged while fleeing from the attacks. Lae'zel managed to escape her pod but found out the nautiloid accidentally teleported into the [[Blood War|Blood war]] front line in [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]].  She immediately took action with other survivors on the ship who were freed due to the red dragon attacks. They eventually navigated the ship back to the material plane before the ship would crash into Avernus.\n\nAfter being back to the material plane and surviving the crash, Lae'zel overheard an encounter between her kin and some tiefling she met near the crash site. She decided to find her kin in a nearby crèche as well as a potential cure for herself. Lae'zel wholeheartedly believed she would turn into an illithid herself―a ''ghaik'' in the [[gith language]]―the creature her people despised the most throughout their existence if she did not act quickly. As she understood, the only way to cure herself from the infection was to visit a [[crèche Y'llek|gith crèche]], and undergo \"purification\" from a githyanki ''ghustil'' and their ''[[zaith'isk]]''. However, she started to notice that her illithid tadpole showed no further symptom development after the infection, which was against everything she had learned about the illithid tadpole. During the pursuit of her cure, Lae'zel encountered other survivors from the same nautiloid who shared the same unusual illithid tadpole infection with her."
