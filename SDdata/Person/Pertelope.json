        "mainbody": "Pertelope was headmistress at the Edificant Library in the Snowflake Mountains of Erlkazar in the midâ€“14 century DR. She was also one of the Chosen of the god Deneir.\nPertelope had graying hair but her hazel eyes displayed a youthful inquisitiveness. She was neat and well groomed, though not modest, but after the effects of the Chaos Curse, Pertelope began covering herself with gowns that were long-sleeved, ankle-length, and done up tightly at the collar, as well as gloves. This concealed her transformed shark skin.\nThe priestess was wistful, irreverent, and preferred to follow common sense rather than stick strictly to rules. Pertelope was a chosen of Deneir and had the ability to hear Deneirs song.\nShe had an affinity for sharks and had loved watching them swimming in the water when going out fishing with her father.\nPertelopes god bestowed on her powers granting prophetic dreams.\nShe was a headmistress at the Edificant Library and lived in a room above the great hall.\nPertelope was a mentor and substitute mother to the priest Cadderly Bonaduce. Pertelope meant even more to Cadderly after he discovered himself to be a chosen of Deneir.\nIn the , when the Edificant Library was assaulted by agents of Castle Trinity with the Chaos Curse, Pertelope lost herself in her affinity for sharks, resulting in maintaining a featureless torso covered by a shark skin with sharp-edged pentacles. Being half-human and half-shark made breathing air as poisonous to her as water."
