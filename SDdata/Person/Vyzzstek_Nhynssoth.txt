'''Vyzzstek Nhynssoth''' was the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] representative in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], Vyzzstek posed as a loyal lieutenant of [[Zstulkk Ssarmn]] but in truth was the eyes and ears of the Arcane Brotherhood under his master, the South Overwizard [[Deltagar Zelhund]]. His position permitted him to subtly aid the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]]'s interests and, at the same time, he kept under surveillance the [[Harpers]], the [[Kraken Society]], and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].
