        "History": "Tabarast and Beldrune had been to Ripplestones at some point prior to {{yearlink|767}}.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|699-704|17}}\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|761}}, Beldrune and Tabarast had been in Moonshorn Tower for some time, studying the texts there. They had agreed not to broach the subject of [[Chosen of Mystra]], but did so anyway, speculating idly as to the signs claimed by the priests of [[Mystra's Mantle]] in [[Haramettur]] that [[Elminster Aumar]] was once again walking the lands. They had been at this task for years.\n\nBy the spring of that year, Tabarast and Beldrune noticed a stranger walking into Moonshorn; unknown to them this was the Elminster they'd heard about. Though they turned away from the stranger until he left, there were burning letters left in the documents he read; they took those as a sign of [[Mystra]]'s direct intervention, and decided to pursue Elminster and be witnesses in his wake. They rode after him on [[mule]]s. On the way, they were soon passed by [[Ilbryn Starym]], who was also in pursuit of Elminster.\n\nThey reached the [[Castle of the Lady]], where Elminster Aumar apprenticed under the sorceress [[Dasumia]], at some point before the {{yearlinkName|764}}, by which point they were already observing the comings and goings of the two mages from one or more hidden positions near the castle.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|629-630|9}}\n\nBy {{yearlink|767}}, they had abandoned their Elminster search, and had settled somewhere near [[Starmantle]]. There, one day, Tabarast came across a rejuvenating spell in an empty page of his spellbook; Beldrune attested to feeling rejuvenated by it.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|655-656|12}} The two of them had been teachers,{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|668-669|13}} for quite some time at that point, until they were commissioned by a [[Harper]], secretly the god [[Azuth]], to hunt after Elminster, whom he was seeking.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|672-674|14}}\n\nThey made a short stop for food at the [[Fair Maid]], a tavern in [[Ripplestones]], a town where they nearly rode down [[Baerdagh]], a local elderly man. Then they were joined by [[Caladaster Daermree]], another local elderly man and former wizard, who agreed to guide them to nearby ruins where he was almost certain Elminster would turn up.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|722-724|19}}\n\nAzuth protected the three wizards from the destruction that ensued. Then, upon the death of Saeraede, who was struck down by Ilbryn Starym after he had burst from hiding to attack, Azuth held back the explosion that resulted from Saeraede's death throes. Azuth then vanished together with Elminster, leaving the three mages awed and briefly bewildered. They rambled shortly, and then found among the rubble three gowns that Saeraede had stolen previously.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|737-739|19}}\n\nAfterwards, they headed to the Fair Maid, where they had some drinks, showed around the dresses, and talked about their latest adventure. Beldrune embellished heavily, claiming that it was their spells that had saved the day and that Azuth had told them so. Tabarast added that Azuth had told them they'd earned the magical robes they were showing off, though Azuth had said nothing of the sort. [[Sharindala]], a local [[undead]] sorceress, joined them at the tavern and claimed a dress, but Tabarast refused to share. She departed with Caladaster, but said everything they'd said about Azuth was true.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|752-753|20}}"
