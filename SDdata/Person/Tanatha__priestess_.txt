Tanatha was a human priestess of Talos in service of Lord Vorik Aris, operating in Wyvernwatch Castle in the Stonelands around 1369 DR.
Tanatha was darkly beautiful but usually hid it with her armor, appearing anonymous and terrifying instead.
She was cruel and unpredictable, and was fully devoted to her patron and his domain of upheaval and destruction.
Tanatha was a powerful cleric, and could call forth many spells which she largely used to smite her enemies. Her devotion as a stormlord gave her additional storm-themed powers, including shocking grasp, call lightning, water walk, control winds, and lightning bolt.
Tanatha wore ornate black +3 full plate with a matching helm of comprehending languages & reading magic that fully hid her identity, and carried a +3 footmans mace and +3 shield. She also wore a ring of regeneration and had several vials of unholy water.
In 1369 DR, she served Lord Aris as his spiritual advisor as he schemed to overthrow King Azoun IV and enthrone himself. She greatly anticipated the delightful chaos and war he would wreak upon Cormyr, but had absolutely no loyalty to him beyond that, and was ready to abandon Lord Aris the moment his defeat seemed likely.
