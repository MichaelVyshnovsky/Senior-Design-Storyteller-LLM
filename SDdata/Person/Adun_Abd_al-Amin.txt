Adun Abd al-Amin was the general and commander of the Faithful Mamluk Society in Qudra in 1367 DR.
Adun viewed Hatit Abd al-Wajib and Ekuriyah Abd al-Wajib as personal enemies. He actively sought ways to thwart their efforts.
Adun wished to be elected as an emir in Qudra in 1354 DR, but attracted the evil eye in the process and was not successful.
General Amin owned a mamluk sword of obedience (scimitar), a magical dagger, a sash of defense, a ring of protection, and a ring of mind shielding.
