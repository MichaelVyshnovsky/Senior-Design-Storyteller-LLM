'''Tashad''' was a barber, healer, and surgeon from [[Zakhara]] who plied her trades in the city of [[Sigil]] in the [[Outlands]].

==History==
Tashad was transported to the [[Outer Planes]] after an unfortunate altercation with a [[marid]]. When she discovered Sigil she decided to settle in the city, opening a shop in the Lower Ward near the [[Shattered Temple]].

==Activities==
Although her primary business was providing haircuts and shaves, she also provided healing and surgery to paying customers. The [[Athar (faction)|Athar]] were frequent patrons of her shop.

The door to her shop served as a portal to the [[Plain of Infinite Portals]] in the [[Abyss]], though it was only active five days per month. Patrons could access the portal for the price of a shave and a haircut. Tashad could close the portal prematurely by closing the door to her shop.

She was a member of Sigil's [[Free League]].
