Tashad was a barber, healer, and surgeon from Zakhara who plied her trades in the city of Sigil in the Outlands.
Tashad was transported to the Outer Planes after an unfortunate altercation with a marid. When she discovered Sigil she decided to settle in the city, opening a shop in the Lower Ward near the Shattered Temple.
Although her primary business was providing haircuts and shaves, she also provided healing and surgery to paying customers. The Athar were frequent patrons of her shop.
The door to her shop served as a portal to the Plain of Infinite Portals in the Abyss, though it was only active five days per month. Patrons could access the portal for the price of a shave and a haircut. Tashad could close the portal prematurely by closing the door to her shop.
She was a member of Sigils Free League.
