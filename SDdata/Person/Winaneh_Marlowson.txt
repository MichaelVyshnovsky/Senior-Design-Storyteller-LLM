Winaneh Marlowson was a human sorceress in service of Lord Vorik Aris, who operated in the Stonelands around 1369 DR.
Winaneh was clever and efficient, viewing the world in an analytical fashion.
She was an experienced spellcaster, and prepared a wide variety of spells for any situation.
Winaneh possessed bracers of defense, a brooch of shielding, a wand of lightning, and a small carpet of flying. As she traveled with a group of scouts, she also had a light warhorse.
In 1369 DR, she served Lord Aris under Oznod Brekker as they scouted around Wyvernwatch Castle. Their mission was to locate explorers and treasure hunters that intended to wander the wilderness, and kill them before they found Wyvernwatch.
Winaneh was completely loyal to Lord Aris and believed in his quest to conquer Cormyr. Rather than be distracted from this work by Oznods romantic overtures, she rejected him and turned his affection to hate.
