'''Winaneh Marlowson''' was a [[human]] [[sorceress]] in service of Lord [[Vorik Aris]], who operated in the [[Stonelands]] around [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Winaneh was clever and efficient, viewing the world in an analytical fashion.

==Abilities==
She was an experienced spellcaster, and prepared a wide variety of spells for any situation.

==Possessions==
Winaneh possessed ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[brooch of shielding]]'', a ''[[wand of lightning]]'', and a small ''[[carpet of flying]]''. As she traveled with a group of scouts, she also had a light [[warhorse]].

==Activities==
In [[1369 DR]], she served Lord Aris under [[Oznod Brekker]] as they scouted around [[Wyvernwatch Castle]]. Their mission was to locate explorers and treasure hunters that intended to wander the wilderness, and kill them before they found Wyvernwatch.

==Relationships==
Winaneh was completely loyal to Lord Aris and believed in his quest to conquer [[Cormyr]]. Rather than be distracted from this work by Oznod's romantic overtures, she rejected him and turned his affection to hate.
