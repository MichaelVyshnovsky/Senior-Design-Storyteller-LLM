'''Ellard Gauntur''' was a [[War Wizard]] in [[Suzail]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was young.

==Personality==
The young man was self-important, and zealous.

==Abilities==
The self-important man was rather inexperienced.

==Relationships==
The inexperienced man was assigned five [[Purple Dragons]] as his retinue for his last mission: [[Ilstan Narbrace]], [[Unstrarr Troon]], [[Gorloun Hethel]], [[Berent Thallowood]] and [[Mandron Saldar]].

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], five Dragons acted as escorts for the [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] [[Ellard Gauntur]] in his pursuit of the renegade [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]]. They caught up to Rorskryn as he used a portal to [[Marsember]], while in the shape of a woman; Ellard Gauntur figured out that it was Rorskryn transformed from a stain on her clothes, and then got pushed by Ilstan Narbrace through the portal for his trouble.

Then the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]] after them to hide Mreldrake's trail. Targrael found Hethel at the top of the [[King's Tower]] in Marsember; he was at the wizards' armory, asking if Ilstan Narbrace, whom Targrael had just killed, had noticed anything amiss. She slashed his throat as he peeked his head out of the door.
