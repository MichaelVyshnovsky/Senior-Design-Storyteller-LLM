        "Activities": "He traveled through a portal into the Forest of Amtar. The ruins of the gate were also the home of a large tribe of [[gnoll]]s whom he easily took control over. The gnolls thought that he was a representative of their \"god\" [[Yeenoghu]]. The gnolls were more organized than before and he used them for raids in the near area from [[Dambrath]], [[Channathgate]] and [[Rethmar]]. He planned to recruit humans as spies and soldiers. The [[Swagdar]] seemed the best suited for this task. His ultimate goal was to raid [[Halruaa]] since the magically rich country promised the best profit."
