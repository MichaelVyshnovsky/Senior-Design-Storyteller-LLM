        "mainbody": "Quinix was a glabrezu living in the ruins of the Gate of Iron Fangs on the southwestern tip of the Forest of Amtar.\nHe traveled through a portal into the Forest of Amtar. The ruins of the gate were also the home of a large tribe of gnolls whom he easily took control over. The gnolls thought that he was a representative of their \"god\" Yeenoghu. The gnolls were more organized than before and he used them for raids in the near area from Dambrath, Channathgate and Rethmar. He planned to recruit humans as spies and soldiers. The Swagdar seemed the best suited for this task. His ultimate goal was to raid Halruaa since the magically rich country promised the best profit."
