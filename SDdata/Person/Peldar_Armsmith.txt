Peldar Armsmith was the Cloakmaster of Karlaggar, one of the eight districts of Zazesspur, for the Shadow Thieves around 1370 DR.
Peldar was a blacksmith before becoming a well-known arms and armors merchant. Entering into the Shadow Thieves, he was chosen as one of the eight Cloakmasters of Zazesspur.
Peldar had a foul temper. He had decent relationships with the other Cloakmasters as long as they respected his own sphere of influence.
