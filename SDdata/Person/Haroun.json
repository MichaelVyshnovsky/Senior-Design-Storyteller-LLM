        "mainbody": "Dark Lord '''Haroun''' was devoted [[Cyricist]] and the leader of the [[Black Helms]] within the [[Company of the Ebon Spur]], a contingent of mounted crusaders that spread the word of the Mad God during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|You speak as though that would be a bad thing, Jabbar.|Dark Lord Haroun, when told he was afflicted with madness.}}",
        "Description": "He was an enormous man and dressed a coat of [[chain mail]] armor. Like the rest of his company, Haroun rode atop a massive [[bull|war bull]].",
        "Relationships": "Haroun had an antagonistic relationship with his counterpart in the [[Purple Lancers]], His Deadliness [[Jabbar]]. The two never looked upon one another when on the same battlefield fighting for Cyric's cause.",
        "Activities": "For some time, Haroun and Jabbar disagreed so vehemently on admission standards for the Company that they each drew up complex schemes to kill the other.",
        "Possessions": "The Dark Lord of the Black Helms bore a [[gold]]en scepter atop which sat an [[iron]] starburst, depicting one half of Cyric's [[holy symbol]]. His Deadliness Jabbar carried a similar scepter, crowned with the skull that completed the holy symbol of the One and All.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Haroun led the Black Helms along with Jabaar and the Purple Lancers and other holy warriors of [[Shar]] and [[Talos]], to raze the the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]] and recover the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', a holy tome of the Cyricist faith.\n\nWith their leaders gone, the Company of the Ebon Spur fell into chaos and soldiers from the Black Helms and Purple Lancers fought against one another in the ensuing chaos. Each of the commanders' scepters were recovered by Malik."
