        "mainbody": "Dark Lord Haroun was devoted Cyricist and the leader of the Black Helms within the Company of the Ebon Spur, a contingent of mounted crusaders that spread the word of the Mad God during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was an enormous man and dressed a coat of chain mail armor. Like the rest of his company, Haroun rode atop a massive war bull.\nHaroun had an antagonistic relationship with his counterpart in the Purple Lancers, His Deadliness Jabbar. The two never looked upon one another when on the same battlefield fighting for Cyrics cause.\nFor some time, Haroun and Jabbar disagreed so vehemently on admission standards for the Company that they each drew up complex schemes to kill the other.\nThe Dark Lord of the Black Helms bore a golden scepter atop which sat an iron starburst, depicting one half of Cyrics holy symbol. His Deadliness Jabbar carried a similar scepter, crowned with the skull that completed the holy symbol of the One and All.\nIn the , Haroun led the Black Helms along with Jabaar and the Purple Lancers and other holy warriors of Shar and Talos, to raze the the library-fortress of Candlekeep and recover the Cyrinishad, a holy tome of the Cyricist faith.\nWith their leaders gone, the Company of the Ebon Spur fell into chaos and soldiers from the Black Helms and Purple Lancers fought against one another in the ensuing chaos. Each of the commanders scepters were recovered by Malik."
