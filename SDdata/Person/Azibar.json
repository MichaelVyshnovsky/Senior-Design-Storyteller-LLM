        "mainbody": "'''Azibar''', who was nicknamed '''Azibar of the Seven Skulls''', was a vile [[wizard]] apprentice who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the 1350's [[DR]].",
        "History": "Azibar was apprenticed to a particularly wicked [[mage]] named [[Melinter]]. He would meet his master, along with other apprentices and members of their gang, in a small courtyard in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. The courtyard would later become known as [[Melinter's Court]] because of these meetings."
