        "mainbody": "human\nLord Hund Hiilgauntlet was a noble member of the Hiilgauntlet family in Waterdeep sometime during the first half of the 14 century DR.\nIn his younger days, Lord Hund was an accomplished fighter. In later life he became a master of the necromantic arts.\nLord Hund was eccentric in an evil way. He made his family uncomfortable and they were quietly pleased when he disappeared into Undermountain. He loved a good fight and relished pitting himself against adventurers that explored his tomb, taunting and joking with his opponents at every opportunity. He also loved acquiring new knowledge through books and frequently demanded or bargained for new ones.\nAs he grew older, he became obsessed with creating a tomb for himself and his eventual undeath, complete with undead guardians. Several attempts to build such an elaborate mausoleum in the City of the Dead were delayed indefinitely or denied by the Lords of Waterdeep.\nLord Hund was the grand-uncle of Lord Jhassin Hiilgauntlet, patriarch of the family in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe made an enemy out of House Eltorchul when he betrayed one of that familys scions by first paying a large sum of money for the location of a gate into Undermountain and then later turning the young lord into one of his undead guardians.\nLord Hund studied necromancy for years and was adamant about securing a place for his \"afterlife\". After unsuccessfully petitioning the Lords of Waterdeep for a spot in the City of the Dead, he heard about a newly discovered portal that was a two-way passage into the depths of Undermountain. It had been discovered by some young sons of the Eltorchul family and Lord Hund offered a small fortune to one of them to reveal the location of this portal. The transaction was made and Hund started using the portal to transport workers and mages-for-hire to the Arcane Chambers and build an elaborate tomb complex to his specifications.\nWhen Lord Hunds Tomb was completed, he killed most of the workers and used their corpses to create the many undead guardians he desired for his new home. This include the young Eltorchul lord that sold him the location of the portal, drawing the enmity of his brothers who tried to attack Hund in his tomb, only to be driven back by the guardians. Instead, they ransacked his villa in the city during the night, carrying off anything of value, including Hunds daughter. They hired magical assistance to destroy the gate so Hund could never again use it to return to the surface world.\nBefore he died of natural causes, Lord Hund brought a specialist mage from Calimshan to perform an elaborate and expensive ritual to turn him into a mummy. Thereafter, he resided in his tomb reading his books over and over again, waiting for adventurers to stumble into his lair or attack with purpose and perhaps bring new reading material for him to study."
