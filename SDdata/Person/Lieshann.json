However, she took the wrong trail and came upon the mysterious Mages Tower that stood on the edge of the Flooded Forest. She only saw it from a distance, however, and left. Afterwards, by the late 1350s DR, Lieshann regularly sang about the mysterious tower, telling that it was an entrance to the lair or underground kingdom of a gold dragon or some other, even more powerful wyrm. According to her, this dragon shapechanged into another form to enter and descend to the subterranean realm. However, those whod actually managed to enter the tower called this story \"bardish moonshine\". Lieshann admitted shed only seen it from a distance, but still sang her version of the story."
