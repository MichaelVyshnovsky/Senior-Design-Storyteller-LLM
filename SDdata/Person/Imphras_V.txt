'''Imphras V''' was a boy king of [[Impiltur]] who never ruled.

==Relationships==
Imphras was the oldest nephew of King [[Soarimbrar the Younger|Soarimbrar]]. His mother was named Ilmara, and he had a younger brother named [[Imbrar II|Imbrar]].

==History==
King Imphras V was next in line to be king when his uncle was murdered just before his coronation. Since Imphras was only four years old at the time, Queen-Regent [[Sambryl]] continued to reign in his stead.

In [[1363 DR]], however, Imphras died of a wasting disease before he had even come of age. His younger brother, Imbrar became the next king.
