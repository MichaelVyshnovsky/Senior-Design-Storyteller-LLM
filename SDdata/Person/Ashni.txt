'''Ashni''' was the student of [[Neverwinter Academy]].

==Biography==
Ashni was a student of Neverwinter Academy. When Qara caused trouble at the Academy, Praven went after her. Once [[Qara]] and the [[Kalach-Cha]] came out of the [[Sunken Flagon]] and defeated [[Praven]], Ashni would confront them and attack. After the battle, the headmaster, [[Jochris]], appears and scolds Qara, then leaves off to prepare a plan for revenge for her.
