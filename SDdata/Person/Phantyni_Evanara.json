She was a member of [[House Evanara]].<ref>\n\nShe died and became an undying [[baelnorn]]. By [[1370 DR]], she had served her god for millennia at the [[Temple Beyond Time]] in [[Mhiilamniir]] in neighboring [[Eaerlann]].\n\nAlongside [[Susklahava Orbryn]] and [[Roanmara Neirdre]], she was one of the Timespinners: historians, oracles, sages, and seers whose advice was sought by the faithful on the temple's occasional returns to the normal time-stream."
