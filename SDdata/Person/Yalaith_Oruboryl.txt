Lady '''Yalaith Oruboryl''' was a beloved socialite and [[thief]] in [[Thentia]] in the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
Lady Yalaith was the only publicly tolerated professional thief in Thentia, who earned the adoration of the city with her high-profile and risqué crimes. The Lady Thief of the Parties would seduce a paramour at a social event, and after taking them to a private bedroom, would drug and rob them, tossing the valuables out the window to an accomplice. She would then re-join the party for a time before making her escape.

Her exploits were the stuff of legend, and being known to attend parties that she "worked" at was a status symbol in Thentian high society.

Thentians who traveled abroad would signal their origin to each other with a secret sign in her honor — flipping a coin down onto a table using two fingers of the left hand.
