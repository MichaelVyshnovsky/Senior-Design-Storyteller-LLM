        "mainbody": "Timothy was the name given to a gnoll archer who was mentally enslaved by a follower of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers during the late 15 century DR.\nShortly before the , three gnolls had their will dominated by a True Soul cultist of a new fledgling religionâ€”the Absolute. Linsella used her psionics, granted her via being infected by an illithid tadpole, to enslave and re-train the gnolls as her servants and cooks in the Moonrise Towers, which were the cults base. She renamed her slave gnolls to Barnabus, Timothy, and Tomelia. Linsella claimed that shed quelled the gnolls savage nature and showed them a \"gentler way.\" Timothy was instructed to work in the kitchen, yet bloodthirstiness and rage still seethed underneath the painful mental domination.\nWhen the gnolls and their mistress encountered a group of the True Soul heroes of Baldurs Gate they may had been helped by severing Linsellas mental leash, leading to the cultists swift death. Some said that the heroes couldve dominated the gnolls themselves, while by other accounts, the three gnolls couldve remained under the cults control and perished in an assault by Harpers and the True Soul heroes on the Moonrise Towers."
