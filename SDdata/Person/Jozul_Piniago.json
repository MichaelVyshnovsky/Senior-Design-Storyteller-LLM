        "mainbody": "uke Jozul Piniago was a human man and a noble of the city of Procampur in the Vast in the early 1360s DR.\nHe held the title of \"Duke\" among Procampan nobility.\nWhen King Azoun IV launched his crusade against the Tuigan Horde in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR, Duke Piniago sold supplies to the army, and profiteered off the campaign. He took little other part in the war, yet felt unjustly proud of his involvement. He considered the Tuigan to be little more than barbarian bandits, however.\nIn the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR, Piniago hosted a banquet at his palace, to which he invited some 22 guests, including his courtesan, the Hierarch Orn Thavil of the local temple of Tymora, and the lama Koja of Khazari, the former grand historian of Yamun Khahan of the Tuigan Horde. Koja requested money from the Duke to fund the mass-printing of his next work, A History of the Tuigan. However, the amount was more than Piniago was willing to pay, and he only desired a single copy to hoard his own library. Piniagos consort insulted Koja, and the lama excused himself.\nPiniago was blunt, boorish, and coarse-mannered. He had a reputation as a gourmand, and held banquets with a wide array of fine dishes, and was also a heavy drinker. He brought his dogs to his banquets, and threw them scraps during meals.\nHe was quite wealthy and appreciated the arts, even owning a library. However, he preferred to fund the creation of books and artworks to fill his personal collection, forcing others to come to him to view them.\nHe hired a courtesan to serve as his consort. \nJozul Piniago was quite tall and broad. He had black hair and thick beard.\nDuke Piniago had a palace deep in the Nobles District of Procampur. It was surrounded by high walls topped by statues of grotesque creatures and iron spikes to deter intruders and unwelcome guests. Guarded gates led into a courtyard and the palace proper, described as a \"manse\". Inside, the outer chambers were carpeted and had enchanted music playing in each room, a different tune for each purpose. Among these was a banquet hall. The dukes servant had powdered faces and fancy livery."
