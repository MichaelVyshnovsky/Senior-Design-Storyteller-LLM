        "mainbody": "'''Duke Jozul Piniago''' was a [[human]] man and a noble of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the early 1360s [[DR]].",
        "History": "He held the title of \"[[Duke]]\" among Procampan nobility.\n\nWhen King [[Azoun IV]] launched his crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]] in [[1360 DR|the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Duke Piniago sold supplies to the army, and profiteered off the campaign. He took little other part in the war, yet felt unjustly proud of his involvement. He considered the Tuigan to be little more than barbarian bandits, however.\n\nIn [[1362 DR|the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], Piniago hosted a banquet at his palace, to which he invited some 22 guests, including his courtesan, the [[Hierarch]] [[Orn Thavil]] of the local temple of [[Tymora]], and the lama [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]], the former grand historian of [[Yamun Khahan]] of the [[Tuigan Horde]]. Koja requested money from the Duke to fund the [[printing press|mass-printing]] of his next work, ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]''. However, the amount was more than Piniago was willing to pay, and he only desired a single copy to hoard his own library. Piniago's consort insulted Koja, and the lama excused himself.",
        "Personality": "Piniago was blunt, boorish, and coarse-mannered. He had a reputation as a gourmand, and held banquets with a wide array of fine dishes, and was also a heavy drinker. He brought his [[dog]]s to his banquets, and threw them scraps during meals.\n\nHe was quite wealthy and appreciated the arts, even owning a library. However, he preferred to fund the creation of books and artworks to fill his personal collection, forcing others to come to him to view them.\n\nHe hired a [[courtesan]] to serve as his consort.",
        "Physical description": "Jozul Piniago was quite tall and broad. He had black hair and thick beard.",
        "Palace": "Duke Piniago had a palace deep in the Nobles District of Procampur. It was surrounded by high walls topped by statues of grotesque creatures and iron spikes to deter intruders and unwelcome guests. Guarded gates led into a courtyard and the palace proper, described as a \"manse\". Inside, the outer chambers were carpeted and had enchanted music playing in each room, a different tune for each purpose. Among these was a banquet hall. The duke's servant had powdered faces and fancy livery."
