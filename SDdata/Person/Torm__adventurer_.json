        "mainbody": "Torm was a human rogue and a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor.\nHe was born in Westgate to the prostitute Netha and an unknown man, heavily presumed to be Dathguld, the most powerful lord of the city. For this lineage, he was targeted by the Night Masks.\nWhen Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur and her dowry went missing in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Torm was one of three notorious thieves named as suspects by High Suikh (king) Helbareim Alanasker, but was innocent. Torm could well have gone looking for the real thief, perhaps deciding to have the loot as well as the blame.\nHe wore a thin mustache and a longsword.\nHe loved to tease Rathan Thentraver."
