Kylia was a rock gnome illusionist who served as a messenger and informant for Laeral Silverhand in Skullport, in the 14 century DR.
She dressed in an all-red, hooded robe, and wore a golden necklace.
She had a very pleasant personality, to the point that many of her foes underestimated her. Kylia also had a flair for the dramatic, and was especially fond of appearing and disappearing in a puff of smoke.
Kylia owned several magical items, among them a robe of eyes, a staff of thunder and lightning, a pair of bracers of defense, and a ring of gargoyles.
