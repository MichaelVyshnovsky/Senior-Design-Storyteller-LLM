==History==
At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gheris Hhune became afflicted by [[lycanthropy]], the affliction that led him into the servitude of the [[Kozakuran]] [[vampire]] [[Cazador Szarr]], the lord of the [[Szarr Palace]] in Baldur's Gate. Along with [[Blaise Hhune]], [[Duver Rillyn]], and other [[werewolves]], Gheris massacred a party of influential guests at the Szarr Palace, shortly before Cazador attempted to perform his ascension ritual. Gheris was guarding the passage past the massacre site to Cazador's dungeon, and sought to please his master and gain his favor. The beasts and lycanthropes were likely put out of their misery by the [[Absolute Adversaries]] and the [[vampire spawn]] [[Astarion Ancunín]].
