'''Hagar Hlutwigsson''' was a [[hagspawn]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Hagar was the son of [[Hlutwig Long-throw]], last chieftain of the [[Blue Bear Tribe]], and the [[annis]] [[Tanta Hagara]], at that time shaman of the tribe. Hagara banished her son at a young age and Hagar took to wandering. Over time, he assembled a small gang of followers, both fellow [[Uthgardt]] outcasts and [[half-orc]]s. Meanwhile, [[Malar]] granted Hagar the power of the [[bear warrior]]s. Eventually, he and his so-called [[Bull Elk]] tribe arrived in Waterdeep, where they established themselves as a criminal gang.
