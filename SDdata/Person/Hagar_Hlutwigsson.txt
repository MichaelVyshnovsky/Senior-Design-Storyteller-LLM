Hagar Hlutwigsson was a hagspawn in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Hagar was the son of Hlutwig Long-throw, last chieftain of the Blue Bear Tribe, and the annis Tanta Hagara, at that time shaman of the tribe. Hagara banished her son at a young age and Hagar took to wandering. Over time, he assembled a small gang of followers, both fellow Uthgardt outcasts and half-orcs. Meanwhile, Malar granted Hagar the power of the bear warriors. Eventually, he and his so-called Bull Elk tribe arrived in Waterdeep, where they established themselves as a criminal gang.
