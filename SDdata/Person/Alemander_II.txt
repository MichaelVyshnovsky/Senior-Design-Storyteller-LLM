King '''Alemander II''' of [[House Tethyr]] was the ninth king of the [[Lions' Dynasty]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Alemander was the grandson of King [[Coram III]], whom he would eventually succeed. He had a bastard [[Half-elf|half-elven]] son named [[Kymer]] and a son through marriage named [[Coram IV|Coram]].

Besides Kymer's mother, Alemander was also rumored to have had an affair with his court vizera [[Wyvorlaa]]. Regardless of the truth of the rumors, she indeed influenced his rule more than his own dukes and chancellors.

==History==
Alemander was born in [[1150 DR]] and was crowned king in the [[1181 DR|Year of the Shieldtree, 1181 DR]].

In [[1188 DR]], Alemander's vizera Wyvorlaa was accused of consorting with a [[lich]] living beneath the [[Starspire Mountains]]. The king's nobles pressured him to order her execution, and he at last consented.

Alemander died in [[1202 DR]]; Coram, his firstborn legitimate son, succeeded him as [[Coram IV]].
