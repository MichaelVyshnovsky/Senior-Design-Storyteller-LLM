        "mainbody": "ally Flymm was a merchant and cobbler who, alongside her husband, Dravo Flymm, ran Flymms Cobblers in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 14 century DR. Sally was also the mother of the infamous Lord Gortash, one of the leaders of the Cult of the Absolute.\nSally was a human woman who, in the late 15 century DR, was an aged matron. She had a light skin tone and hair silvered with age and dark eyes. While running the shop, Sally wore a simple black dress with red frills and a leather corset over it. Her wrinkled neck was decorated with a simple silvered necklace.\nSally and Dravos shop was located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, near Beehive Goods and Wares.\nSally and her Husband were poor cobblers who struggled with having their ends meet whilst running the cobbligng business. At some point, the married couple ran into serious debt, owing money to multiple parties, including some vicious loan sharks who threatened to torch the store. Out of desperation, the Flymms sold their young son Envers services to a warlock, earning a hefty sum that secured the shop and their couples safety. Despite a cruel and desperate acct, Sally believed that they did what was best for Enver and the parents. The boy was smart, too smart, according to Sally, so the mother was at peace with the difficult decision to give Enver up and all three surviving versus all three being murdered by the loan sharks.\nYears later, Enver Flymm, now using the name of Enver Gortash, became a warlock in his own right and made a fortune by smuggling weapons. His ambition led Enver to become one of the three leaders of the Cult of the Absolute, assembling an army of brainwashed servants, many of whom were infected with altered mind flayer tadpoles. While unsavory activities were hidden, Enver rose in prominence in Baldurs Gate, becoming a lord. Still bitter over his parents actions, Gortash stormed into Flymms Cobblers like a fist of justice and infected his parents with mind-altering parasites. These tadpoles, however, were different instead of brainwashing them, the creatures dominated the Flymms. Sally was happy and eager, running the business and praising her beloved son for becoming a Lord, all while her true self was locked inside her mind, unable to do much but watch her body being puppeteered by the parasite. Sallys husband, Dravo, is faced with an even darker fate. The parasite completely destroyed his mind, leaving nothing but a smiling puppet behind. By the time the Cult of the Absolutes army attacked the Gate, Sally and Dravo had been controlled by the parasites for several months. It was unknown if the two survived the ensuing battle for the city."
