'''Batina al-Shaat''' was a [[moralist]] priest of [[Hajama]] and the leader of the [[Preachers]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Batina was a rogue compared to other moralist priests in [[Zakhara]]. Moralists typically did not support the use of [[holy slayer]]s to strike down enemies of their god. Batina held no such qualms.

She smiled often when dealing with her followers, but her smile was not pleasant.

==Activities==
Batina guided assassins to strike down anyone she felt was an enemy, including other members of the [[Everlasting]].

She advised the [[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali|Shadow Caliph]] on all matters regarding the faith, yet she did not have any designs on leading the Everlasting. She viewed her current position as having just as much power without the constant risk that the Shadow Caliph faced.

==History==
Batina was enemies with Emir [[Hatit Abd al-Wajib]], who once spurned her for a position of power in [[Qudra]]. She never forgave him for the sleight.

==Possessions==
Batina owned a magical [[short sword]], a bag containing ''[[powder of the hero's heart]]'', and a ''[[shield of the holy]]''.
