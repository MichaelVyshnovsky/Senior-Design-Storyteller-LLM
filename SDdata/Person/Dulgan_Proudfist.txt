'''Dulgan Proudfist''' was a cunning member of the [[Proudfist]] tribe of [[half-orc]]s who lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|You have done well, or you've covered your failures better. Either one is enough for me.|Dulgan Proudfist}}

==Personality==
Unlike his tribe's chieftain who valued strength, Dulgan was a more subtle individual. He respected those who demonstrated shrewdness and cunning above others.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Dulgan and the Proudfists served [[Vansi Bloodscar]] in the [[Many-Arrows]] occupation of the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] of [[Neverwinter]] and fought against the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. When a [[half-elf]] adventurer sought to prove their worth to the Proudfists in an effort to persuade them to change sides, Dulgan challenged them to find his hidden trinkets.

==Activities==
As a way to amuse himself, Dulgan liked to hide small caches of trinkets throughout the River District, unbeknownst to the [[orc]]s.
