'''Marlono Rhandle''' was a relative of one of the [[Gondian]] foundry workers who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|'''..."artifice can outdo magic, given the right smith and a good set of raw materials" - I've carried these words with me all my life, but now I'm beginning to question whether it's really true. Whatever they're doing here with all the steel - it's not for good. Forgive me, Gond, but if we get out of here alive, I don't think I'll ever touch an anvil again.''|Excerpt from Marlono's diary}}

==Description==
Marlono was a handsome [[human]] man with a dark skin tone, black short curly hair, trimmed beard and mustache, and dark brown eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of Gondians was put to work at the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] in Baldur's Gate against their will, forced into slave labor by Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[Cultists of Bane]]. One of the two motivations for the slaves' compliance was the fact that the Gondians' family members were abducted and held hostage within the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]]. Marlono Rhandle was among the cult's hostages. It was unknown if the hostages were rescued before the conclusion of the [[Absolute crisis]], or if the prison was flooded in retaliation for the foundry workers' uprising.
