Marlono Rhandle was a relative of one of the Gondian foundry workers who lived in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Marlono was a handsome human man with a dark skin tone, black short curly hair, trimmed beard and mustache, and dark brown eyes.
In the , a group of Gondians was put to work at the Steel Watch Foundry in Baldurs Gate against their will, forced into slave labor by Lord Enver Gortash and his Cultists of Bane. One of the two motivations for the slaves compliance was the fact that the Gondians family members were abducted and held hostage within the drowned Iron Throne headquarters. Marlono Rhandle was among the cults hostages. It was unknown if the hostages were rescued before the conclusion of the Absolute crisis, or if the prison was flooded in retaliation for the foundry workers uprising.
