'''Olonther''' was a [[wizard]] and a high-ranking member of the [[The Riders of the Sword]] mercenary company based at [[Holdensword|The Hold of the Sword]] in [[Turmish]] early in that nation's history.{{Cite polyhedron/104/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Country Treasures|8}}

==Activities==
He was known to have had his quarters and workplace in a series of secret rooms somewhere within either the castle or the tunnels in the rock outcrop below it. He also built dozens of [[battle horror]]s to defend the castle.

==Rumors & Legends==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was thought possible that some of Olonther's battle horrors remained hidden within the castle or the tunnels, waiting to be reactivated. Furthermore, it was speculated that Olonther's [[spellbook]]s, [[magic item]]s, and treasure might be with them too, and even the old mage himself in some state.
