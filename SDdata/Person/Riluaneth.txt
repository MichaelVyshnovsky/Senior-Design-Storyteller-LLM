Riluaneth was an inhabitant of Cormanthyr in the 3 century DR.
He was rather tall and muscular, for an elf.
His streak of cruelty was almost controlling.
He was resentful, and delighted in teasing and tormenting his cousins.
Riluaneth was taken in by the Alastrarra family after his parents died.
On , when Elminster Aumar came to the Alastrarra house transformed into Iymbryl Alastrarra and wearing his kiira, he stumbled upon Riluaneth playing a game of spellcircles with a maid. He sent a blade towards Elminster, which he dodged, only to find its true quarry was a servant Elminster then stole control of the blade. While the two fought mentally over control of the sword, Riluaneth reached for a dagger rather than risk the magic in it, Elminster cast a spell which Iymbryl had stored in the kiira for precisely such a time. The spell slew Riluaneth on the spot.
