Chonis was an unknown being named in two ruins found in Cormyr the ruins of Chonis Temple in the Stormhorns in the west and the Tomb of Chonis in the plains in the east.
The word "Chonis" was written in the Thorass alphabet in prominent places in both structures. For example, it appeared on the stone lintel over the door in the tomb. This led to both structures being named for this Chonis.
It was unknown who or what Chonis was by the 1370s DR. The ruins in the Stormhorns appeared to have once been a temple dedicated to Chonis, leading to speculation it was a long-forgotten deity, demigod, or fiend.
