        "mainbody": "The Lady of Pain was the enigmatic ruler of the city of Sigil. The nature of her being was not clear, but whatever she was, she was not human.\nNot much was known about the Lady of Pain few in the city ever saw her,\nWhile the Lady of Pain was by no means kind or compassionate, she was not necessarily cruel either. She seemed to care about little more than maintaining the status quo of her city.\nthumb|250px|The Lady of Pain hovering through the streets of Sigil.\nThe Lady of Pain was a being of intense power. So powerful was she that she could block the gods and goddesses from entrance into her city,\nThe Lady of Pain could create demiplanes in the Deep Ethereal, special prisons called \"mazes\" for those who would oppose her.\nDespite her mysteriousness, there was never any doubt the Lady of Pain was real because she had been seen hovering over the streets of Sigil on many occasions. Any who tried to interact with her at such times found their skin erupting in bloody wounds when she gazed upon them, and many others vanished, teleported into the prisons of the hive, so it was not considered a good sign if she was heard to be about in the streets. Eventually, she would vanish again into nothingness.\nAccording to the great wizard Mordenkainen, the Lady of Pain had some sort of connection to the Raven Queen, another enigmatic character. It was said that only the Lady of Pain knew the Raven Queens true intentions.\nThe Lady was served by a strange race of creatures called the dabus. Like the Lady of Pain, the dabus never spoke, but they could communicate her will by forming mystical images of word-pictures. The dabus never left Sigil and likely could not leave Sigil. They acted as workmen to maintain the infrastructure of the city and occasionally appeared in numbers to punish rioters.\nThe Lady of Pain was not a deity, even if she was as powerful as one, for she had no temples and no worshipers, yet she still existed. In fact, she refused worship. Those who tried to worship her were found with their skin flayed off.\nIn ancient past, it was said that an entity challenged the Ladys control over Sigil and nearly defeated her. The Lady of Pain was not able to destroy him she could only entrap his spirit in a gem, known to history as the Labyrinth Stone, which was lost for over 10,000 years.\nThis was not the only time that someone dared challenge the Lady of Pains power. Sometime in the 14 century DR by the counting of years of Faer√ªn, Duke Rowan Darkwood, a former leader from Vaasa titled the Protector of the North and Guardian of the Great Glacier, rose to power in the city of Sigil. Over the course of a single year, he became the factol of the Fated faction, and only a few years after that, he even sought to challenge the rule of the Lady of Pain herself, starting the ordeal known as the Faction War. Through years of searching, his servants eventually brought to him the Labyrinth Stone, which he hoped to use as a weapon against the Lady of Pain by releasing her ancient foe.\nNaturally, the Lady of Pain intervened to stop the war, sending most of the factols into her mystical mazes, including Rowan. Rowan had planned for this, and with the use of a wish spell succeeded in exiting the Ladys labyrinth. Only, she outwitted him yet again. Her magics were so powerful that he exited the maze into a time some 500 years in the past with no way to return to the future.\nOver the next half-millennium, his lifespan extended by magic, Rowan, now renamed Gifad, was imprisoned and driven insane, yet still with enough intelligence to await for when he might be able to meet the \"younger version\" of himself and attempt his plot a second time.\nthumb|The Lady of Pain of Sigil.\nThe Guvners, members of the Fraternity of Order, believed that the Lady of Pain created the city of Sigil. The Ciphers, those of the Transcendent Order, suggested that the city was actually nothing but a living dream of the Ladys.\nAnother theory about the Lady of Pain was that she had something to do with the start of the Blood War. Others hypothesized that she was a rebel fiend herself,"
