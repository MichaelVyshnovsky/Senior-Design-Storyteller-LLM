'''Mahaxara Khal''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] and the Captain of the Royal Guard in service to Prince Andru of the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She was tall and athletic of build. Mahaxara kept her head shaved bald but for a queue of long dark hair at the back, while [[tattoo]]s of [[snake]]s covered both her arms, giving her what some considered a barbaric look.

==Personality==
She was a reticent warrior and, having no interest in the politics of the royal court, she commonly kept her thoughts to herself.

==Abilities==
Very difficult to take by surprise, Mahaxara had an almost superhuman alertness.

==Possessions==
Mahaxara wielded a ''+3 [[two-handed sword]]'' that she specialized in, but as back-up she also had a ''+2 [[short sword]]'' and a [[light crossbow]] with a half-dozen ''+3 [[bolt]]s'' and three [[Arrow of slaying|''bolts of slaying'']], two dedicated to [[illithid]]s and one to [[beholder]]s. She wore ''+4 [[banded mail]]'' and a ''[[cloak of the bat]]''. Finally, she had a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''.

She had private quarters in [[Starhaven]], the palace of Prince Andru in the [[Bral/High City|High City]] of [[Bral]]. It was a spartan and spotlessly tidy place.

==Relationships==
She was a completely loyal to Prince [[Andru]] and [[House Cozar]], and was never far from his side.

Mahaxara saw right through Lord [[Diadan Cartan]]'s act as a witty fop and saw him for the vicious murderer he really was. In private, she hated the man and waited for the day she could confront him in a fair fight.

==History==
Hailing from some faraway world, Mahaxara Khal traveled on a [[spelljammer]] privateer before she arrived on the Rock of Bral. Already an experienced warrior, she enlisted in the Royal Guard and within eight years had risen to its command.
