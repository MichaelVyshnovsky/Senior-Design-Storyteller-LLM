        "mainbody": "'''Estelar Sunweaver''' was an [[elf]] supremacist in [[Tethyr]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Estelar worked for the [[Serôs]] [[aquatic elf]] tyrant [[Gantar Kraok]], acting as one of his agents on the surface.",
        "History": "In 1370 DR, under the orders of Gantar and disguised thanks to his ''[[hat of disguise]]'', Estelar followed the [[Company of the Anvil]] after they had recovered the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' from a long-forgotten [[dwarven]] tomb in the [[Starspire Mountains]].\n\nOn [[Uktar 10]], he was in the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]]. posing as the bard '''Fylson Tarasp'''.\n\nHowever in the inn were also the [[Shields of the Highland]], depressed for the loss of two of their companions and demanded to Estelar to compose a dirge for their two fallen friends.\n\nLater that night, three [[dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''Sondarr Scepter'' and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for [[Dumax]]. This greatly angered the [[Shields of the Highland]]. When [[Bramas Thorntree]], another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the ''Scepter'', Timor, [[Karr]], and [[Vajal]] got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer [[mug]]s and swinging their chairs. Timor's mug struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the [[Company of the Anvil]], used this as an opportunity to escape with the ''Scepter''. Estelar found a nice, out-of-the-way spot and watched the brawl.",
        "Personality": "Estelar strongly believed that elves must rule the world. He agreed with the [[Saratycoron]]'s ideas but acted only after careful preparation. He became a master in using his ''hat of disguise'', creating many personalities to interact with others."
