}}'''Turlang''' was a [[treant]] who guarded the northwestern region of the [[High Forest]], a grove known as [[Turlang's Wood]].
He "governed" over an area of a hundred or so trees, a gentle, calm but authoritative presence over his arboreal realm.

==Activities==
Turlang attempted to halt the intrusion upon his woods by expanding the forest towards [[Everlund]], with the end goal of having trees once again border the [[River Rauvin]].

With his companions, most notably other treants, he oversaw the security of the ruins of [[Hellgate Keep]] by refusing to let anyone in or out, but he was aware that evil was still present, sealed beneath the ruins, and was wary of its escape.

Additionally, Turlang was the caretaker of [[Shadowtop Cathedral]].

==History==
Turlang took part in the defense of [[Earlann]] against the [[orc]] hordes that erupted in the North in {{YearlinkName|-111}}<ref><ref group="note">The source does not give a date of -111 DR, but does state that it was the same orc hordes that preciptitated the fall of [[Delzoun]], and we know that these hordes attacked in -111 DR

Turlang and his fellow treants went to sleep sometime in the mid-thirteenth century Dalreckoning, only to be roused less than a hundred years later by the [[Mistmaster]] who made a deal with Turlang to help him seal off Hellgate Keep. As part of that process, Turlang and a group of [[galeb duhr]] allies triggered a massive avalache that blocked off [[Turnstone Pass]] and access to the [[Upvale]] and the Keep from [[Sundabar]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}

Over a century after Hellgate was successfully sealed, Turlang was a wandering defender of the High Forest, having developed a mild case of xenophobia. Scaring off unwanted intruders, he would cease his wanderings only to take care of the [[Shadowtop Cathedral]]<ref>

==Abilities==
Turlang possessed the ability to ''[[animate tree]]s'' in the area of 180' (54.9 m) around him turning them into fellow treants.

==Possessions==
In addition to carrying a ''[[ring of major elemental resistance]]'', as well as a wealth of valuable [[gem stones]], raw [[gold]], and [[silver]] ore, Turlang had hidden caches of treasure, recovered from invaders, scattered throughout the part of the forest he called home.
