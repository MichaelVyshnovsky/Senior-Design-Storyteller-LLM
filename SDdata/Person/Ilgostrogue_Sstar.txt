Clanmaster Ilgostrogue Sstar was a dwarf leader and revolutionary who left Citadel Adbar in order to claim Mirabar and beyond.
Sstar was said to be mad and never settled for anything.
Ilgostrogue had tens of thousands of followers, including his son and successor, Beerkanstrouge.
Ilgostrogue Sstar was originally from Citadel Adbar. More than a thousand years prior to 1358 DR, Sstar led almost a quarter of the Northkingdoms population, 35,000 dwarves, on an expedition to Mirabar in search of riches. However, they faced daily attacks from orcs while crossing the mountains north of Sundabar, and by the time they reached Mirabar, their ranks had been decimated. A large number of dwarves became disenchanted with the terrible conditions on the northern road and chose to settle down in the safety of the city.
Ilgostrogue became fixated on his goal to establish a great dwarven empire after his initial expedition. He then led the remaining loyal soldiers of his army towards the end of the Spine of the World, ultimately crossing into Icewind Dale. Not long later, the leader perished.
Beerkanstrogue, Ilgostrogues son, continued to honor his fathers vision and convinced the remaining dwarves to found Ironmaster in a rocky dell close to where Ilgostrogue first looked out over the sea.
