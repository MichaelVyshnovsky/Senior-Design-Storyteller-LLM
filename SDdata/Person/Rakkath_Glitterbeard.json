        "mainbody": "'''Rakkath Glitterbeard''' was the proprietor of the [[Counting House]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a man who lived a double life: serving as the treasurer for both the city-sponsored [[Council's Eminent Fellowship of Financiers]] and the less-official [[Honorable Order of Moneylenders]] crew, as well as acting as the Kingpin of [[the Steeps]] within the criminal organization known as [[the Guild]].",
        "Personality": "Rakkath was described as somber and rather aloof. He possessed a rather sinister reputation in both aspects of his life.",
        "Activities": "As the Kingpin of the Steeps, Glitterbeard oversaw the loansharks and goons who menaced those poor Baldurians who were desperate for loans. He facilitated the safekeeping of many valuable treasures the Guild had stolen, hiding them within the subterranean vaults of the Counting House."
