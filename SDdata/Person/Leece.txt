Leece was a maid working at the Dragonriders Club in the late 15 century DR.
She found it notable that nobles were crazy.
Leece witnessed Arclath Delcastles attempt at bribing Tress, proprietress of the Dragonriders Club, to find out the name of Amarune Whitewave, the masked dancer who had danced for him and his comrades the night prior. Upon seeing how money Arclath was willing to leave behind, even as an apology, she commented that nobles were crazy. Tress agreed.
