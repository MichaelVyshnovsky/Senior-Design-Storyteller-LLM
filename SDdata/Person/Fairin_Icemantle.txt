'''Fairin Icemantle''' was a [[sage]] of the 6{{th}} and 7{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

Fairin was the author of the ''[[Treatise Against Blood-Metal]]'', in which he expressed his reservations about [[orcslayer]] blades whose steel was poisonous to [[orc]]s. He feared that they would lead to the development of other alloys toxic to many races, and spread death and destruction.

His treatise also discussed the [[dwarf|dwarven]] attack on the [[orc]] kingdom of [[Vastar]] in the [[610 DR|Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]], in which the dwarves wielded the new orcslayer blades. This provided the only first-hand account of the conflict to later generations. Fairin described the dwarven slaughter of the orcs, saying that they "run in waist-high riot across the land".
