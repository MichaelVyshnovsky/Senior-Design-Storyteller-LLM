Fairin Icemantle was a sage of the 6 and 7 centuries DR.
Fairin was the author of the Treatise Against Blood-Metal, in which he expressed his reservations about orcslayer blades whose steel was poisonous to orcs. He feared that they would lead to the development of other alloys toxic to many races, and spread death and destruction.
His treatise also discussed the dwarven attack on the orc kingdom of Vastar in the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR, in which the dwarves wielded the new orcslayer blades. This provided the only first-hand account of the conflict to later generations. Fairin described the dwarven slaughter of the orcs, saying that they "run in waist-high riot across the land".
