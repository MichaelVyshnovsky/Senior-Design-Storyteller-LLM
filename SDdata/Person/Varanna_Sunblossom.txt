Varanna Sunblossom was a half-elven veteran who lived and died in the 15 century DR.
As a half-human of the wood elfin blood, Varanna had pointy ears and dark bronze skin. She wore her hair tightly bound in rows with temples shaved.
By the time Varanna died in the , she was already a battle-worn veteran soldier. When the new deity began spreading its worship across West Faerûn, Varanna found herself joining the Cult of the Absolute, putting her sword in its service. However, despite her loyalty, Varannas life was ended by the murderous whims of an Absolutist general. Her soul yearned for revenge against the deadly cult, and Varanna Sunblossom was among the dozen individuals plucked from the Fugue Plane, chosen by the entity Withers to aid in his campaign against the Dead Three and their Cult of the Absolute.
