'''Nadlok Bormul''' was a member of the [[Shield Council]] of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Nadlok grew up in [[Crimmor]] in [[Amn]] but sold all his holdings to the [[Crytrappers]] and moved to [[Athkatla]] in [[1366 DR]]. There, Nadlok made much money, becoming one of the richer tavern and festhall owners in the city. However, bored by money, he greatly enjoyed his role in the Knights of the Shield and soon rose through the ranks to the Shield Council.
