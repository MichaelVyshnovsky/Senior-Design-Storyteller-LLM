'''Sarliman Eurdoe''' was an inhabitant of the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] and a local entrepreneur.

As a "hothands", or entrepreneur, Sarliman imported the [[rosecork]] tree from [[Prespur]] to his native land for its fire-resistant properties and value in building. The trees went on to flourish by the southern tributaries of the [[Wyvernflow]].
