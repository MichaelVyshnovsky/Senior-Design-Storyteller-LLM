'''Thuldra Thuldrin''' was a [[dwarf]] commoner in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] who was displaced by [[the Absolute]] and, as a refugee, sought shelter in [[Baldur's Gate]].
{{quote|''Don't pay me any mind, now! I'm just trying to make sure everyone gets fed.''|Thuldra Thuldrin}}

==Description==
Thuldra was a stout clean-shaved dwarven woman with freckled olive skin.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees along the way in the process. Thuldra Thuldrin found her way to the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, she was refused entrance. Being a kind soul, Thuldra worked with the [[Flaming Fist]] to feed the refugees in the camp, and asked Father [[Lorgan]] of the [[Open Hand Temple]] for [[carrot]]s, [[apple]]s, or anything they could spare for the starving refugees.
