'''Hrabbaz''' ({{Pronounce|hrah|BAWZ|refs=}}) was a bodyguard of [[Gralhund|House Gralhund]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Hrabbaz protected both [[Yalah Gralhund]] and her husband [[Orond Gralhund]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} the Gralhunds were involved in the search for the lost gold of [[Dagult Neverember]] under the promise of getting their fair share of the treasure. The Zhents led by [[Urstul Floxin]] used Gralhund Villa as their headquarters during their search for the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]''.

When a fight started between her guards and the [[Zhentarim]], Hrabbaz was at his mistress Yalah's side and hid with her in her master bedroom. He was with her when she gave the ''Stone'' to her nimblewright servant with orders as to where to take it.

==Personality==
Hrabbaz always showed good manners and his clothes were immaculate.

==Relationship==
Hrabbaz truly respected Yalah but would like to see Orond humbled.
