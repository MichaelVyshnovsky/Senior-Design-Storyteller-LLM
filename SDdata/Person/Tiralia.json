She was rather attractive, had a fair complexion, and sported curly red hair that dropped down to her shoulders.",
        "Personality": "Tiralia was extremely flirtatious and never failed to attract attention. When it came to fight, she preferred to use her incredible strength and [[staff]], using her wizard spells to protect her or improve her chances in close-quarter combat.",
        "Abilities": "After her incident with a spell gone wrong, Tiralia had strength equivalent to that of an [[ogre]] and could wield weapons suitable for a [[hill giant]].",
        "Possessions": "As a wizard Tiralia possessed a number of magical items. These included ''[[ring of djinni summoning]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +2'', a ''[[wand of fireballs]]'', and a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]''. In terms of non-magical items, she carried an [[ironwood]] staff that was {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} thick.\n\nTiralia also possessed [[spellbook]]s that contained and allowed her to cast the spells ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[audible glamer]]'', ''[[blur]]'', ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'', ''[[deeppockets]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', and ''[[wizard lock]]''.",
        "History": "Tiralia grew up not knowing her parents, living among nobles as a successful courtesan. Eventually she grew tired of life among nobility and used all the money she had earned to enroll at a school of [[magic]]. She managed to learn there for two years before her funds had depleted, after which she left to become an adventurer. After a long journey, she joined the Iron Maidens adventuring company,{{Cite polyhedron/55/The New Rogues Gallery: Iron Maidens|19}}"
