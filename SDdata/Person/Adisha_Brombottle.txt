Adisha Brombottle was a halfling merchant at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the late 15 century DR.
Adisha was depressed, bored, and very often drunk. She believed, out of paranoia, strangers to be agents for the Great Worm of the glacier intending to destroy the barrier that kept the storm at bay.
Adisha was one of the guests at the monastery in 1491 DR with her two teamsters.
