'''Bonnerbas Ironcap''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] soldier from [[Mithral Hall]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR]],  Bonnerbas was a member of [[Dagna Waybeard]] squad, which was sent from Mithral Hall to protect the refugees from [[Nesmé]]. After [[Fender Stouthammer]], his dwarf companion, was overwhelmed by [[trolls]], Bonnerbas was the first to realise he was dead. Bonnerbas himself was killed soon after by [[Proffit]] during the ensuing battle.

After the dwarves and refugees of Nesmé had escaped from the trolls, the dwarves huddled together, and offered prayers to [[Moradin]] for the souls of Bonnerbas.
