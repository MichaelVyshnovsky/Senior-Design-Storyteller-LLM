Bonnerbas Ironcap was a dwarven soldier from Mithral Hall.
In 1370 DR,  Bonnerbas was a member of Dagna Waybeard squad, which was sent from Mithral Hall to protect the refugees from Nesmé. After Fender Stouthammer, his dwarf companion, was overwhelmed by trolls, Bonnerbas was the first to realise he was dead. Bonnerbas himself was killed soon after by Proffit during the ensuing battle.
After the dwarves and refugees of Nesmé had escaped from the trolls, the dwarves huddled together, and offered prayers to Moradin for the souls of Bonnerbas.
