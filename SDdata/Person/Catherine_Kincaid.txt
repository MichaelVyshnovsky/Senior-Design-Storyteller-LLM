Catherine "Cat" Kincaid was the Captain of the Harbor Patrol of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.
Cat Kincaid was often outfitted with her enchanted +1 chainmail and a ring of invisibility and inaudibility.
Catherine Kincaid was orphaned at the age of 14 and was eventually adopted by Jason Shimel, a corporal of the City Guard in Ravens Bluff who raised her to adulthood. Subsequently, Jason was assassinated by the citys black-market operatives. Catherine joined the City Guard to stop tragedies like hers ever happening again and later became the famously fierce commander of the City Guards Harbor Patrol.
