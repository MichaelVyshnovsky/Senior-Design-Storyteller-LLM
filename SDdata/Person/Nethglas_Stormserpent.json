        "mainbody": "Nethglas Stormserpent was a heir of House Stormserpent in the early-to-mid 14 century DR. He stole the Wyverntongue Chalice as a prank, and later accompanied Emvar Obarskyr on the day of their deaths.\nNethglas had a strong nose and a mustache.\nTo his little brother Marlin, he was unpleasant and shark-like.\nHe was the son of Narmitra Stormserpent. He was the eldest of four siblings, followed by Elgrym, Marlin, and Rondras Stormserpent.\nAs a youthful prank, Nethglas Stormserpent stole the Wyverntongue Chalice from the Room of the Red Banner and hid it instead near the Dragonskull Chamber, both in Castle Obarskyr. He told his three brothers about it, and meant to brag about it more, but instead he began to fear consequences and swore them to secrecy. When his brother Elgrym told Nael Rowanmantle, Nethglas had the two of them killed in what he later characterized as an \"unfortunate accident\" to his two remaining brothers.\nHe was slain later while accompanying Emvar Obarskyr in the Vast Swamp, where they were ambushed by Sembian forces"
