        "mainbody": "ndreas Vanderslyke was a monster hunter.\nThe hunter traveled far and wide in search of evil creatures to stalk. His home was the wilderness, and he was uncomfortable in towns and cities. He explored dungeons not to find treasure, but to test himself against dangerous monsters that lived there.\nAround 1369 DR, Andreas and his companion Honus were ambushed and pursued by the Shadowcloaks of Calaunt. Trapped in a small room, Vanderslyke and Honus were surrounded by the criminal organization and given a mock trial with Shartana acting as judge and jury."
