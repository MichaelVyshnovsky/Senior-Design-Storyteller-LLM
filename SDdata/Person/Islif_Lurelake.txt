'''Islif Lurelake''' ({{Pronounce|ISS|liff|refs=}}) was one of the original [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Islif was born in the village of [[Espar]] to the trader [[Buckman Lurelake]]. She was tutored in the way of sword by the old warrior and hunter [[Skuldi Wolfspear]]. Islif went to search of fortune with [[Florin Falconhand]], [[Doust Sulwood]], and [[Jelde Asturien|Semoor Wolftooth]].

Later, Doust asked her to marry him when he was nominated Lord of [[Shadowdale]] and she agreed, serving her husband as captain of the militia and giving birth to a son, [[Jhaok Sulwood]], while fighting against [[drow]], [[Zhentarim]], and [[Lashan Aumersair]]. When Doust retired and gave the lordship to [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], she and her family retired to [[Arabel]] to live quietly.
