'''Vynnia''' was a young [[dark one]] who was a member of the [[Glumguts]] family of [[dark creeper]]s in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Vynnia was a cousin of [[Blackclaw (dark stalker)|Blackclaw]], the terrifying and merciless leader of the Glumguts.

Vynnia, another cousin named [[Thrax]], and Blackclaw's son, [[Blackcut]], weâ€™re the only members of the Glumguts who dared to cross Blackclaw. They played pranks across Evernight, embarked on sly ventures, sought excitement by harassing people who did not seem to be native to the [[Shadowfell]], and merrily committed acts that embarrassed and hindered the aspirations of the Glumguts' employers, [[Netheril]]. This in turn meant that if the the three youngsters' involvement in these events were discovered, it could ruin the whole family. Before that, they ran the risk of invoking Blackclaw's wrath, although they believed they would be fine because Blackcut was his son.
