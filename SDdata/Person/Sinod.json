        "mainbody": "'''Sinod''' was an Overseer of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] during the occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] who reported to [[Kya Mordrayn]] herself.",
        "History": "Sinod was one of the cultists who were led by Kya Mordrayn in 1369 DR into the ruins of the ancient elven city to take control of a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' in the basement of [[Castle Cormanthor]]. He ordered lieutenant [[Garesh]] to hunt down a band of [[orog]] mercenaries who rebelled against their cultist masters who were stripping souls off their kin, tuning them into subservient living [[zombie]]-like creatures. According to the notes left behind in the [[Elven Catacombs]], Sinod threatened Garesh with Kya Mordrayn's thinning patience because of the lieutenant's inability to handle the orog problem."
