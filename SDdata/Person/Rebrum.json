        "mainbody": "Rebrum was a travelling merchant from Sheirtalar in Lapaliiya.\nAround 1210 DR, Rebrum wrote the Life of Rebrum, a bawdy autobiography that was frequently copied. In it, among other things, Rebrum wrote of the \"Eleave\" trade-fair in Vaerndoun in the Underdark. Here, Rebrum mentioned a group of drow traders, sent by their matrons, who attempted to barter the Chanting Chain, a holy relic of Talos the Destroyer, to another group of drow from a distant city."
