        "History": "Nal'dorltyrr was appointed as weapons master in [[1469 DR]] after the elder boy and previous weapon master was killed at a party. This was a scandal in the city because no drider had never held such a powerful position. However, Nal'dorltyrr proved that his ability with weapons was unrivaled in his house. He was constantly challenged by rivals, but Nal'dorltyrr had defeated them all."
