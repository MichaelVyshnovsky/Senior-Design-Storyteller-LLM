Nüber was a rather annoying man who lived on the Sword Coast during the mid—14 century DR.
His boot size was six rods and a jackdaw.
He had the habit of repeatedly asking inane questions and sharing non sequitur statements about his life.
On one occasion, Nüber saw a rider on a horse.
In the , Nüber went searching for Kayler in order to join the Shining Crusade with the hopes of getting a new pair of boots. He made it at least as far as Dead Mans Pass.
