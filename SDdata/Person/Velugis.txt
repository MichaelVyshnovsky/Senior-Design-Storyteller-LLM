'''Velugis''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] as of {{yearlink|1374}}. Originally, he was from [[Thay]], and he mostly kept to himself, staying in his bed when he was not on assignment. Word on the fortress was that he drank only water, and never asked for a woman to be sent to his room. However, he was known to have a grasp of poisons and alchemy second only to that of the Old Man of the Mountain himself. He spotted one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] that [[Berun]] fought through in the night of [[Tarsakh 25]] to make his way to [[Chereth]] and [[Lewan]] inside [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]], from his post just inside the main gate.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||29}}
