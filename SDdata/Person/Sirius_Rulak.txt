Sirius Rulak was a Zhentarim mercenary commander in Daggerdale around 1479 DR.
Rulak and his squad were paid by the Shadovar to expel a large band of gnolls from Anauroch. Instead of killing the gnolls, Rulak devised a plan to drive the band to Daggerdale. He later offered his services to Daggerdales leaders to eliminate the gnolls.
Rulak was assembled by the mayor of Dagger Falls with the constable and an adventuring party hired by Kendar Morn for a meeting to decide the best option for dealing with the gnolls.
