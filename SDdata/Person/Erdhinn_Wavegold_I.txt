King '''Erdhinn Wavegold I''' was the first [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Wavegold]] dynasty.

==Relationships==
Erdhinn was the distant descendant of [[Jamyll Torlath]], the daughter of [[Imnel Torlath I]]. His son was [[Belhinn Wavegold|Belhinn]], though it was his grandson that took up the regnal name [[Belhinn Wavegold I|Belhinn I]].

==History==
Erdhinn came to the throne of Amn in the {{YearlinkName|1095}}, after the assassinations of King [[Imnel Torlath IV|Imnel IV]], King [[Niskam Torlath|Niskam]], King [[Rhor Torlath|Rhor]], and King [[Dornak Torlath|Dornak]] that took place over the previous year. With the [[Torlath]] family annihilated, he used his ancestral link to the family to quell the mounting unrest and bring stability back to the realm. His efforts succeeded, and Amn entered a period of peace free from the conspiracies of ambitious merchants.

The unexpected death of Erdhinn and his son in [[1115 DR]] led to his young grandson ruling with a regent for some time, the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Herald]] [[Thultar Mornhelm]].
