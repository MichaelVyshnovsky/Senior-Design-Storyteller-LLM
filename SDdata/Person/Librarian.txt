Elf
The Librarian was a consciousness that inhabited an enormous statue in the gem-encrusted Hall of Living Memory in Myth Nantar.
The Librarian manifested as a statue of three elves performing daily tasks reading, praying, and writing upon a scroll. It was situated in a domed chamber, the walls of which were lined with kiira. As the Librarian spoke to visitors, the eyes of the three elves in the statue shone and triggered similar flickering in the surrounding kiira.
It was in fact the transmuted remains of three ancient elven sages that lived during the time of ancient Aryselmalyr.
The Librarian was rather cryptic in its interactions with others. It could only be spoken to when in the presence of people of elven lineage.
If any entity touched the Librarians surface, it would take from them their memories, likely causing some form of feeblemindedness. When this occurred, one of the Librarians three faces would grow a new kiira upon its forehead and release it into the surrounding chamber.
The Library served as a repository of ancient elven knowledge. this was often a rather perplexing affair.
Some time during or around the , Red Wizards from the land of Thay sought out the Librarian in its home city. They were followed by Zehira Deryan and her fellow adventurers.
Zehira and her companions were able to hold audience with the Librarian, and their ally Thessalia.
