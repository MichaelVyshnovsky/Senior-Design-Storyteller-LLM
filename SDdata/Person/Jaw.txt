'''Jaw''' was the name of a wilderness guide from [[Chult]], whose death was immortalized in the [[book]], ''[[Journey Through the Jungle]]''. It was not entirely clear if she was a real person, or fictional character created for the story of ''Journey''.

==History==
As described in ''Journey Through the Jungle'', Jaw accompanied an unnamed traveler through the enigmatic and perilous jungles of Chult. Their foray into the wilds were cut short however, when they heard the call of, and were rapidly beset by the legendary monster known as [[Uluu Thalongh]]. The pair attempted to flee by climbing a pair of trees, but were ultimately too slow. Silent in its assault, and leaving no trace of its movement, Uluu Thalongh wrapped itself around Jaw's leg, and claimed her as its latest victim. Jaw's patron was left alive, thus allowing her story to be immortalized in the pages of ''Journey''.
