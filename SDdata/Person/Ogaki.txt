Ogaki was a samurai retainer of the Korimori clan in Maeshi Province in Kozakura in 1360 DR.
Ogaki was the second-in-command of Lord Korimori. In 1360 DR, he, together with his lieutenants Himeji and Sakigahara, led a bushi army into a village formerly ruled by the Michimori clan. There, however, an adventuring party, hired by Michimori Uemon to retrieve the Seven Swords, fought and defeated his troops.
Ogaki preferred to observe a battle from a distance. He was careful of his safety, as he planned to receive the keep of Michimori after his lords triumph.
