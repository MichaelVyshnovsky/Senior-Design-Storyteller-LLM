'''Imbralym Skoond''' was a [[wizard]] and member of the [[Parliament of Peers]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Imbralym desired to use his magical power to acquire great riches. He was an amoral but charming individual.

==History==
Originally, Imbralym worked as a dancing master in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], before he realized his talent for magic. He went to [[Baldur's Gate]] to search for a rich sponsor. Imbralym soon attracted the interest of [[Grand Duke]] [[Torlin Silvershield]], who, after proving his suitability and that he was not a threat, made him one of his subordinates. Duke Silvershield also appointed Imbralym as a member of the Parliament of Peers by [[1479 DR]].
