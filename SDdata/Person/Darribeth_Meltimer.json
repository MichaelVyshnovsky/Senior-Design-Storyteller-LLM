Teeha told her that [[hezrou]] demons were close by to prevent her leaving. There, she may have at last been found and rescued by adventurers if they killed or drove away the toad. If so, and they restored her sanity, she would travel to Amphail and then [[Triboar]] and finally have a happy reunion with Urgala at [[Northshield House]].",
        "Relations": "Darribeth was the wife and adventuring companion of [[Urgala Meltimer|Urgala]]. Another former adventuring companion was [[Harthos Zymorven]].",
        "History": "While on an expedition in the Underdark, a fellow adventurer was killed and Darribeth became lost. The [[quasit]] [[Teeha]], posing as a talking [[toad]] that Darribeth did not quite remember meeting, teased her with promises of escape that proved false.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Look, Teeha!

        "Personality": "After contact with [[demon]]s, Darribeth had gone mad, being afflicted with paranoia and having hallucinations, though she desperately wanted to escape and be back with Urgala. If a ''[[greater restoration]]'' spell was applied on her, Darribeth regained lucidity. She was a curious and kind woman who didn't care about breaking the rules if needed to do good.",
        "Description": "She was slight of build and had long black hair. After living years in the Underdark, her [[robes]] were gray and tatty, as was the cloth she used to tie back her hair.",
        "Possessions": "Darribeth still had her [[spellbook]], containing [[spell]]s such as ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]'' (which aided in her Underdark travels), ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[greater invisibility]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', and others.\n\nShe kept it, [[material component]]s, a [[dagger]], canteen, a blanket, and 11 [[gp]] in a pouch with a [[backpack]] with a broken strap. She also had a ''[[rope of climbing]]'' retrieved from her slain companion."
