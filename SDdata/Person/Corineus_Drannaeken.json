        "mainbody": "Sun elf\nCorineus Drannaeken was a former sun elf, that spent his existence as a baelnorn watching over the remains of the Irithlium in ruined Myth Drannor, following the citys destruction in the 8 century DR.\nIn life, Corineus was a tall and handsome elf with flowing red hair and eyes that were flecked with gold.\nAs a baelnorn, Corineus eyes turned entirely white, with white milky flesh was so thin that his bones were readily visible beneath his skin. He had long, broken toenails that extended far beyond his feet. He wore the same ragged garments for centuries, a set of once-fine robes that remained as mere tatters tatters.\nEven as a lich, he was a thoughtful and considerate individual. He was appreciative of those that helped preserve the sanctity of Myth Drannor, even in its state of ruin.\nBy the graceful and deadly manner in which he fought, Corineus appeared to have been bladesinger during his mortal life.While this is not explicitly stated, The Sieges describes his fighting style as a \"bladedance\", in line with descriptions of bladesinger fighting styles.\nIn undeath, Corineus emanated an aura of coldness that could immobilize others that came within a certain radius of his presence.\nHe had in his possession a magical, undetectable ring that allowed the wearer to see through illusions and deceit, as well as turn invisible themself.\nOn Mirtul 19 in the , Corineus encountered the Vaasan adventurer Vala Thorsdotter within the depths of the Irithlium along with her Shadovar escorts. the undead elven bladesinger enlisted Vala to help eradicate the phaerimm that infested the depths of the arcane academy. They cut down the minions that guarded the aberrant masterminds, slaying scores kobold, bugbears, and mind flayers, before exterminating the last five remaining phaerimm themselves. In appreciation of her service to Myth Drannor, he gifted Vala his magical, non-detectable ring."
