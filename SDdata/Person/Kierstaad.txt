Kierstaad, or Kierstaad the Swift, was a barbarian king of the Tribe of the Elk in Icewind Dale.
Like his father, Kierstaad had a secret desire to experience "civilized life" in the cities of the Sword Coast.
Kierstaad was born in 1347 DR to Revjak, king of the tribe until 1364 DR. Kierstaad did not like the new king Berkthgar for his strict views but never challenged him openly.
Kierstaad proved himself decisive in the conflict between the Companions of the Hall and demon lord Errtu. He was the first after Wulfgars apparent death to be able to use the hammer Aegis-fang. For his valor in later years, Kierstaad became king of the tribe until his death.
