'''Kierstaad''', or '''Kierstaad the Swift''', was a [[barbarian]] king of the [[Tribe of the Elk]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Personality==
Like his father, Kierstaad had a secret desire to experience "civilized life" in the cities of the [[Sword Coast]].

==History==
Kierstaad was born in [[1347 DR]] to [[Revjak]], king of the tribe until [[1364 DR]]. Kierstaad did not like the new king [[Berkthgar]] for his strict views but never challenged him openly.

Kierstaad proved himself decisive in the conflict between the [[Companions of the Hall]] and [[demon lord]] [[Errtu]]. He was the first after [[Wulfgar]]'s apparent death to be able to use the hammer ''[[Aegis-fang]]''. For his valor in later years, Kierstaad became king of the tribe until his death.
