Raella Hiess was a female human wizard living in Skullport in the 1360s and 1370s DR. She was the true proprietor of The Deepfires inn and collected information for the Lords of Waterdeep.
Although Raella was the actual proprietress of The Deepfires, she preferred to work behind the scenes and instead served as an ordinary barmaid. Instead, her companion Vhondryl pretended to be the owner. They operated as partners Raella was available at all times and arranged meetings between Vhondryl and her customers and clients in the dealing of poisons and potions.
Raella used the inn as a means of gathering information for the Lords of Waterdeep and for sale to others, as did her friend Irusyl Eraneth.
Raella was herself an accomplished mage.
Raella and Vhondryl knew each other very well and were quite fond of one another. Theyd been companions for a number of years, even saving each others life on countless occasions. Raella granted Vhondryl permanent rooms at The Deepfires, and together upheld the ruse that Vhondryl was the owner and Raella the barmaid. Vhondryl knew of Raellas role in gathering information for the Lords of Waterdeep, and kept her secret.
Raella was also a close acquaintance of Irusyl Eraneth, who also secretly collected information for the Lords through The Deepfires. Thanks to Raella, Vhondryl also knew this. Raella and Irusyl exchanged information regularly.
