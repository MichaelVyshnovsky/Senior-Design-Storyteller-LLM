'''Quellonis''' was a friendly and outgoing ancient{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|3}} [[satyr]] who lived just outside the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] in [[the Vast]] and frequented the [[Morden Winery]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the war against the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] concluded in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the couple who ran the Morden Winery in the Vast disappeared, presumably taken and killed by the [[Tuigan]]s. A year later, a young priest of [[Earth Mother]] came across the abandoned winery. [[Larn]], the said priest, restored the vineyard and resumed its [[wine]] production. During that time, he befriended a duo of fun-loving satyrs – Quellonis and [[Harmon (satyr)|Harmon]]. The two [[fey]] were regular guests of Larn's, tasting new wines, singing songs, and playing music late into the night.{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|21}}

However, that friendship was cut abruptly when the [[medusa]] [[mage]] named [[Samanthiss]] and her consort – [[maedar]] [[Vorlon]], found the winery and decided to take over. Larn was [[petrified]] by the medusa, while Vorlon assumed the assumed identity of the vintner. The couple continued operating the winery for the following decade. Vorlon showed remorse over Larn's fate but came to love winemaking. Larn's stone body was kept in good condition if the medusas ever needed food.

One day satyrs returned to their friend's winery and were met with a closed door with Larn sending them away from behind it with a voice that did not sound quite right. The satyrs soon realized what had happened but could not challenge the powerful monsters openly. Quellonis and Harmon decided to bite their time, spy on the medusas, and plan revenge. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a group of adventurers was tasked with investigating the winery, and their investigation led the group into a [[harpy]] ambush. The friendly satyrs interrupted the harpies' ''charm'' songs with a song of their own played on magic [[pipes]]. The friendly satyrs told the heroes everything they uncovered about the winery and its slithering masters. Subsequently, the satyrs information aided the heroes in either slaying the inhabitants of the winery or forging a firefly business relationship, freeing Larn from his petrified state.
