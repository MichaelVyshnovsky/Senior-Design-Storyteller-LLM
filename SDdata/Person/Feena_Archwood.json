        "mainbody": "Feena Archwood was a natural werewolf and cleric of Selûne. In 1373 DR she briefly served as Moonmistress of Moonshadow Hall and refounded the long-lost New Moon Pact.\nShe often chose to dress simply in light sandals, a blue skirt of homespun wool, and a blouse of linen dyed yellow with yarrow. In wolf form, her pelt was russet, the same color as her hair. She wore a battered and scratched medallion with the silver symbol of Selûne.\nFeena was the daughter of Maleva. Her mother, knowing that Feena was a werewolf, sent her to mother Dhauna Myritar at Moonshadow Hall, a temple of Selûne in Yhaunn, Sembia. At the temple, she was trained to control her inner wolf and to become an acolyte. In her stay at the temple, she met Mifano, who was a novice and an acolyte with her, a young man with silvery hair who was extremely flirtatious.\nWhen casting hold person, she was known to use the phrase \"Bright Lady of Night, stay his hand!\" as the verbal component."
