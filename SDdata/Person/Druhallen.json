        "mainbody": "'''Druhallen''' was a particularly talented [[mage]] that traveled the [[Western Heartlands]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He famously ventured into the mines of [[Dekanter]] along with his old flame [[Rozt'a]], her foster son [[Tiep]], and a [[Sheemzher|particularly well-mannered goblin]] to save the life of his longtime friend [[Galimer]], and wound up recovering an [[Nether Scrolls|ancient artifact]] from the lost empire of [[Netheril]].",
        "Description": "He had an unassuming appearance that was far more befitting a laborer than a wielder of the [[arcane arts]]. Druhallen had a square head, with slightly-larger-than-average features, that sat atop a laborer's frame.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|What's cut stays cut.|Dru's personal motto.}}\n\nDruhallen was a stubborn and plain-speaking man that did not mince words. He maintained a rather reserved demeanor and seldom let his emotions get the better of him, except under the most stressful or distressing circumstances. \n\nHe was not one to think about \"what ifs\" or otherwise think about what could have been. As soon things played out in his life, he only considered what actions could he take given his current circumstances.",
        "Abilities": "Dru demonstrated great aptitude for spellcasting even at a young age, developing his own minor [[cantrip]]s without any training in the arcane arts.",
        "Possessions": "Like his brother Galimer, Druhallen worked his spells from a \"spellbook\" that was rather unique in design. He used a finely-crafted box with many little compartments that stored the [[material component|reagents]] he used for spellcasting.\n\nRather than wield a [[quarterstaff]] like many other [[wizard]]s, Druhallen carried with him an [[ax]]-handle, a weapon more befitting the son of a carpenter.",
        "Activities": "Druhallen served as the premiere mage of his traveling group, in part by ensuring their safety with the use of [[ward|magical wards]]. Just as Galimer did, Dru studied for and prepared his arcane spells just after midnight.\n\nThroughout much of his journeys, Druhallen spent much of his time collecting a group of rare and valuable [[Material component|spell reagents]] in order to cast a single [[scrying]] spell that he believed would offer him and Galimer some insight into their shared past. Among the components he had collected were a perfectly-formed [[pearl]], a bone taken from a [[mummy]], and some blood collected from an actual [[dragon]].",
        "Relationships": "Dru's father was a carpenter,\n\nFrom their time together under Ansoain's care and tutelage, Druhallen and Galimer became the closest of freinds, spending nearly all their time together. For a long time, Dru never considered the fact they would not be a part of each others' lives, even as old men in their twilight years.\n\nOn two occasions in his life did Druhallen attempt to form a connection with an animal as a [[familiar]]. His childhood pet [[cat]] could not focus enough for the bond, and a certain [[parrot]] he encountered was far too self-centered.",
        "History": "Druhallen was raised alongside five older brothers in the village of Sunderath. The lives of the three mages changed dramatically in the {{YearlinkName|1353}}, when the caravan with which they were traveling was ambushed by [[Red Wizard]] and their undead minions while en route from [[Elversult]] eastward towards [[Hlondeth]].\n\nDruhallen and Galimer continued on their work for a few years, eventually taking on the services of the bodyguard Rozt'a around the {{YearlinkName|1356}}. Druhallen and Rozt'a felt immediate mutual attraction for one another and found themselves in a steady relationship. and the couple had even taken on a young boy from the streets of [[Berdusk]] as their own son.\n\nThe company traveled together for nearly another decade, periodically making effort to take revenge on the Red Wizards that had taken Ansoain's life and uncover more of the secrets that surrounded its circumstances. In the {{YearlinkName|1363}} Druhallen spent a summer at [[Candlekeep]], with the hopes of learning more about the [[Netherese glass disk|glass disk]] the pair had recovered from the ambush site. Within five years time, Dru and Galimer had killed three of the Red Wizards with the intent to get revenge on the others. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Dru finally convinced Dru and Rozt'a to delve into the mines of Dekanter to more fully understand exactly what sort of magic they had encountered that day. They traveled from [[Llorkh]] to [[Parnast]], in order to follow the [[Dawn Pass Trail]] south through the [[Greypeak Mountains]] into Dekanter, but their plans were halted due to interference by the Lord [[Amarandaris]]. Just as they were left without and prospects, Druhallen met a surprisingly well-mannered [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] named [[Sheemzher]], who requested that the group come meet his mistress, the mysterious and magical being known as [[Lady Wyndyfarh]].\n\nDespite having Sheemzher as a guide, the journey through [[Weathercote Wood]] to the Lady's glade proved dangerous. Careless and harmful actions taken by the young lad Tiep drew the ire of Lady Wyndyfarh. She accused the group of defiling her forest, claimed Galimer as a hostage and tasked them with quest as recompense for their transgressions: the group would continue their journey through the Greypeaks into Dekanter, and recover one of the lost ''[[Nether Scroll]]'' of ancient [[Netheril]], and bring it back to the Lady of the Forest within her grove.\n\nIn the depths of the mines, the group faced down the malevolent [[undead]] being known as the [[Beast Lord]]. Dru set the example for the group, putting himself in harm's way first to offer up the best chance of successfully recovering the ''Nether Scroll'' and having Galimer back in their lives. The rest of the party banded together, recovered the scroll, and distracted the Beast Lord long enough for everyone to make it out alive. As the party journeyed back to Weathercote, Druhallen was given the opportunity to read from the ''Nether Scroll'' himself and learn some of the fundamental truths about [[magic]] that escaped so many spellcasters in the Realms. Upon their arrival, Dru, Rozt'a, and Tiep were reunited with Galimer, and the two mages that grew up with one another were afforded an audience with the Lady of the Forest. They three talked of the secrets of Dekanter, Lady Wyndyfarh shared some about her past, and the two mages were offered some insight into the mysterious disk that guided their journey across the Heartlands towards Dekanter, all while under a night's sky that was not the same one normally seen throughout their place in the Realms.\n\nAfter they returned to Parnast, Druhallen made one final deal with Lord Amarandaris to ensure his family's safety moving forward. He offered the Zhent ruler a copy of the first portion of the ''Nether Scroll'' in exchange for his word that the Black Network would forget about Dru and his companions, and act as if they had never known one another at all."
