'''Laragunt of Threskel''' was an archmage.

==History==
Laragunt was a wizard from [[Threskel]]. Around [[1487 DR]], he went in search of the [[Lost Spell]] at the [[Oldspire]] mansion, like many other archmages. When a [[spellstorm]] hit the place, Laragunt and a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] tried to escape but the magic energies made them insane.
