Wishes was a violet faerie dragon who worked at the Pink Flumph theater in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
Unlike typical dragons, Wishes did not keep a treasure hoard. Instead, the dragon donated all its earnings to Waterdhavians in need. At night, it flew throughout the city while invisible, and left coins in various places, such as doorsteps and windowsills, or nightstands and under pillows.
Wishes was very skilled with telepathy. Whereas typical faerie dragons could usually only communicate telepathically with other faerie dragons, Wishes was capable of communicating with humanoids as well.
At the Pink Flumph, Wishes was in charge of providing special effects to the plays, by making use of its innate magical abilities. It tended to remain invisible most of the time.
The dragon was also very protective of the theater, immediately rising to its defense should the building or its inhabitants be threatened.
The faerie dragon kept working at the theater despite its strong dislike of its owner Iokaste Daliano. The feeling was mutual the widow usually called Wishes "the flying serpent".
Wishes was the companion of the Pink Flumphs late owner, Algondar Daliano. After Algondars death, Wishes decided to preserve his legacy by continuing to provide special effects to enhance plays and performances given at the theater.
