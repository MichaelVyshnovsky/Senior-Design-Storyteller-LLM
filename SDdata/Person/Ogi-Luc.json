        "mainbody": "gi-Luc was an archmage from the country of Sembia.\nOgi-Luc had a very robust body.\nOgi-Luc was known to be a very intelligent man.\nNot content with the extent of his already impressive strength, Ogi-Luc created an enchanted great robe to improve it even further. For a while he had become feared among Sembians, for wherever he walked proud men would step aside and the boastful grew hushed. However, he ultimately lost in a fight to a Red Wizard abjurer by the name of Nesk Vhaltim, who proceeded to take his great robes for himself. The robes were then later stolen from Vhaltim by a rogue who sold them. They eventually ended up in the possession of Orrick the Grey in 1281 DR."
