        "History": "Not content with the extent of his already impressive strength, Ogi-Luc created an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[Ogi-Luc's great robe|great robe]] to improve it even further. For a while he had become feared among Sembians, for wherever he walked proud men would step aside and the boastful grew hushed. However, he ultimately lost in a fight to a [[Red Wizard]] [[abjurer]] by the name of [[Nesk Vhaltim]], who proceeded to take his great robes for himself. The robes were then later stolen from Vhaltim by a [[rogue]] who sold them. They eventually ended up in the possession of [[Orrick the Grey]] in [[1281 DR]]."
