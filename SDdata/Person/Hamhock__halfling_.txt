Hamhock was a halfling who worked as a spy for a Calimport thieves guild.
He dressed in short, green pants and a green vest, with a red-and-white-striped undershirt. He had light skin and light brown hair.
Hamhock owned a magical short sword.
Originally hailing from the Shaar, Hamhock was orphaned at an early age. He eventually secured passage to Calimport on a trading caravan, learning rudimentary thieving skills en route. In Calimport, he worked as a servant for a local thieves guild for a while, further developing his skills, before being assigned to work as a spy.
