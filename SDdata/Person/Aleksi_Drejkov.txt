Aleksi Drejkov was a noble member of the Cult of the Howling Hatred in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Aleksi saw his allegiance to the Howling Hatred only as another method by which he could damage his rivals.
Aleksis family once ruled a great trading empire, but he had no ability to rule it, and soon his rivals outmaneuvered and betrayed him. So Aleksi joined the Cult of the Howling Hatred and became leader of a cell in the city.
In 1491 DR, after many schemes had been ruined, the high leaders of the cult decided to wipe out the Drejkovs cell and sent a cadre of assassins led by Little Wing to silence them. After killing Drejkovs steward, Niko Sevek, the cultist assassins burned Dreikovs mansion. Aleksi managed to escape in time, but was confronted by an adventuring party whod been falsely accused of one of the cultistss assassinations. He was sniped at by the assassins.
