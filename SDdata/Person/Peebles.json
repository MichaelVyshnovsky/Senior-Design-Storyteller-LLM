        "mainbody": "'''Peebles''' was a [[deep gnome]] servant of the [[beholder]] [[Xazax]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Peebles said he had long been interested in [[aberration]]s, and especially in beholders.",
        "Activities": "Peebles was the personal surgeon and attendant of Xazax the Eyemonger, a beholder who attacked other beholders for their eyestalks. Peebles would graft these eyestalks onto Xazax's own body.",
        "History": "Xazax sent Peebles to [[Mantol-Derith]] ''circa'' [[1486 DR]] to search for more [[beholder]]s from which to take new eyestalks. He had checked the [[duergar]] and deep gnome sections of the city, but had not yet searched the drow section and the [[Zhentarim]] garrison."
