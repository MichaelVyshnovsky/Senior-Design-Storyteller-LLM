        "History": "One of Naren's ancestors was the original owner of the Dragon's Tooth sword, the sword that The Mandible's leader held as a badge of office.  Years prior to [[1479 DR]] the sword compelled Naren to leave [[Waterdeep]] and journey to Skullport where he lived ever since.  He clawed his way up the Mandible's hierarchy in an attempt to reclaim his ancestral sword.",
