He was a lesser lord of the Mandible gang, a position he believed was too low for him.\nOne of Narens ancestors was the original owner of the Dragons Tooth sword, the sword that The Mandibles leader held as a badge of office.  Years prior to 1479 DR the sword compelled Naren to leave Waterdeep and journey to Skullport where he lived ever since.
