Firefoam was the famous war horse of the leader of the Knights of Myth Drannor, Florin Falconhand.
Fireform was a white charger or heavy war horse.
Similar to a paladins mount, Firefoam was intelligent and through telepathy could communicate basic information such as feelings and danger, recognize beings, and respond to questions with yes or no answers. He could fight with hooves and bites, whether with his rider or alone.
Florin received Firefoam via a wish some time before 1358 DR. It was expected to serve him until around 1364 DR.
