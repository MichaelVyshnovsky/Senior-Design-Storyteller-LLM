'''Drayson Fivestars''' ({{Pronounce|DRAY|sun|_|FEYEV|starz|refs={{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|31}}}}) was a member of the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]] in [[Mulmaster]] in [[1491 DR]].

==History==
Drayson joined the Cloak at an early age. His partner was [[Salvar Brix]].

In 1491 DR, during a routine visit to a lost tower near the city, Drayson was captured by the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] and brainwashed into joining them. The cult chapter's leader, [[Therus]], sent Drayson back to the city to spread their doctrine among the worshipers of [[Umberlee]]. However, the high priestess of Umberlee, [[Rydah]] the Storm Soother, saw the threat and some of her followers killed Drayson.{{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|5}}
