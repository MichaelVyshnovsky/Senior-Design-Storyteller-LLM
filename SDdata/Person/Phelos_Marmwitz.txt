'''Phelos Marmwitz''' was a librarian of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Managing the small [[Ghars library]], Marmwitz lent out [[book]]s, took returns, insisted patrons be quiet, and obtained new books of no less than forty or so years old and that in his view were "serious literature". He was disappointed his library was not frequented more often.

Marmwitz had a special interest in [[history]] and shared his own collection of history books with the library. He searched for certain tomes and was pleased to find them.

==History==
{{fq
| text   = A town history of [[Juniril]]. A splendid volume, published forty years ago. Been looking for it for ages.

On [[Eleint 17]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to the library to return ''[[The Internal Structure of the Brachiopod]]'' on behalf of [[Benelaius]] and questioned Marmwitz about recent research into the [[Vast Swamp]] and the legend of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]], as part of his investigation into [[Dovo]]'s murder. Marmwitz was irritated at Jasper for disturbing [[Grodoveth]] in his research.

Later, on the night of [[Eleint 20]], Marmwitz was collected by the local [[Purple Dragon]]s for a midnight meeting at Benelaius's cottage regarding the murders of Dovo and Grodoveth; Marmwitz rode in a carriage driven by [[Khlerat]]. There, Marmwitz merely confirmed Grodoveth's research into local legends of Fastred and the Vast Swamp.

==Personality==
He was rather fussy and a stickler for library rules.

==Description==
He was lean and withered with great age.
