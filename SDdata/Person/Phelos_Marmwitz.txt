Phelos Marmwitz was a librarian of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Managing the small Ghars library, Marmwitz lent out books, took returns, insisted patrons be quiet, and obtained new books of no less than forty or so years old and that in his view were "serious literature". He was disappointed his library was not frequented more often.
Marmwitz had a special interest in history and shared his own collection of history books with the library. He searched for certain tomes and was pleased to find them.
On Eleint 17 of the , Jasper went to the library to return The Internal Structure of the Brachiopod on behalf of Benelaius and questioned Marmwitz about recent research into the Vast Swamp and the legend of the bandit chieftain Fastred, as part of his investigation into Dovos murder. Marmwitz was irritated at Jasper for disturbing Grodoveth in his research.
Later, on the night of Eleint 20, Marmwitz was collected by the local Purple Dragons for a midnight meeting at Benelaiuss cottage regarding the murders of Dovo and Grodoveth Marmwitz rode in a carriage driven by Khlerat. There, Marmwitz merely confirmed Grodoveths research into local legends of Fastred and the Vast Swamp.
He was rather fussy and a stickler for library rules.
He was lean and withered with great age.
