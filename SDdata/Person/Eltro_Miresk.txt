Eltro Miresk was the founder of a school of magic and the first Magus Senior of the Conclave of Silverymoon.
Miresk was tall and lean and liked to wear black robes. Wherever he went, he was followed by a set of three floating magical rods, which his students named "The Triad".
Eltro Miresk was haughty, but he was also a superb teacher. Miresk believed in balance and taught that magic use should be tempered with other natural forces. He encouraged the creative use of simpler "everyday" spells over reckless use of the more powerful ones.
Miresk was an exceptionally powerful mage with a vast array of spells at his disposal. He was also particularly skilled in alchemy, arcana and spellcraft, and the knowledge of history. He knew a good deal about nature, religion, and the planes of existence as well.
"The Triad" was said by his students to provide the Magus Senior with the powers of several ioun stones in addition to acting like a rod of negation and a source of limitless unseen servant, hold portal, and hold monster spells. Miresk could use any of these powers without actually having to make contact with the floating Triad.
Miresk founded a school of magic from his home in Silverymoon, named Miresks School of Thaumaturgy. When High Lady Alustriel founded the Conclave of Silverymoon in 1369 DR, she appointed Eltro Miresk as its first Magus Senior, and his original school became a part of the larger institution.
