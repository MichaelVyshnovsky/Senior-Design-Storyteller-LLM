Bluster was a brown bear who was a friend of the ranger Montolio "Mooshie" Debrouchee in the early 14 century DR.
Bluster was a brown bear and in the middle of his life.
In the 1340s DR, Drizzt came to his cave after coming to the surface. Bluster did not argue, but let him live in his cave for the winter. Drizzt gave him fish most of the time, and when he left, he left one final fish meal for Bluster.
