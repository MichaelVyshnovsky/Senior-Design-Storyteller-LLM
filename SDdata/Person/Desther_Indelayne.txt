'''Desther Indelayne''' was a [[cleric]] in the service of [[Maugrim]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
When the [[Wailing Death]] broke out in [[Neverwinter]] in 1372 DR, Desther was the leader of a contingent of [[Morag]] cultists sent to infiltrate the city by posing as [[Helm]]ite clerics. Under the guise of aiding the city, Desther and his followers were actually spreading the plague.

When the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] engineered a cure for the Wailing Death, Desther stole the potion and escaped to [[Helm's Hold]]. The Hero tracked Desther down and captured him. He was executed for his crimes alongside [[Fenthick Moss]], his unwitting accomplice.
