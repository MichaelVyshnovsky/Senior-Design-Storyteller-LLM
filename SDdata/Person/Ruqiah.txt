'''Ruqiah''' was a member of the [[Desai]] tribe, part of the nomadic [[Bedine]]. She was the  reincarnation of [[Catti-brie]].

==Description==
Like her former incarnation but despite her parents' darker complexions, Ruqiah had thick, light brown hair with red highlights and blue eyes.

Ruqiah had two spellscars, one on each arm. On her left forearm was a seven-pointed star on a circle of red (the symbol of [[Mystra]]); on her right forearm was a unicorn's head (the symbol of [[Mielikki]]).

==History==
Ruqiah was born in [[Anauroch]] on the spring equinox (19 Ches) in [[1463 DR]] to [[Niraj]] and [[Kavita]]. At age five, her blooming magic and secret garden caught the attention of the [[Netherese]] lord [[Parise Ulfbinder]], who sent [[Shadovar]] agents [[Untharis]] and [[Alpirs De'Noutess]] to kidnap her. They failed and were killed by Ruqiah, who fled soon after to protect her parents, who practiced magic, from the [[Netherese]].

In [[1469 DR]], Ruqiah was taken in by Lady [[Avelyere]] to be trained in the magic arts at her Coven in the [[Shade Enclave]], where she remained for ten years until [[1479 DR]], when Lady Avelyere discovered her true identity. She then fled to Longsaddle, where she ceased using her name, preferring the alias ''Delly Curtie'' instead. In [[1482 DR]], she settled in [[Bremen]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. The following year, [[Spider Parrafin]] ([[Regis]]) joined her in Bremen, where they bided their time until the spring equinox of [[1484 DR]]. At this time, they met up with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], saving his life from a mortal injury. It was at this time that Ruqiah returned to her original name of [[Catti-brie]].

==Relationships==
===Niraj and Kavita===
Ruqiah had a close relationship with her parents, [[Niraj]] and [[Kavita]], who learned of her nature as [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]] in [[1468 DR]]. Her father's nickname for her was "Zibrija," a type of flower that grew in the desert.

===Lady Avelyere===
Despite a rough start, Lady [[Avelyere]] viewed Ruqiah as one of her favorite students and gave her preferential treatment, allowing her to visit her parents once a tenday. However, she was not averse to using magic to pry information out of Ruqiah.
