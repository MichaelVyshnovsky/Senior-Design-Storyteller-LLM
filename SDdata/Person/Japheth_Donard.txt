'''Japheth Donard''' was a [[warlock]] of a fey pact with the [[archfey]] [[Neifion]].

==Description==
Japheth had black hair and black eyes. He was almost always seen wearing his mysterious cloak, which seemed to have strange powers itself.

==Personality==
Japheth was addicted to [[traveler's dust]]. 

==History==
Japheth Donard was once an acolyte and librarian at [[Candlekeep]]. It was at Candlekeep that he found the book ''[[Fey Pacts of Ancient Days]]''. He summoned Neifion to save him from the death that traveler's dust brings. Neifion sealed the fey pact with an [[emerald]] pendant.

Japheth became an agent of [[Behroun Marhana]],

In [[1396 DR]], [[Malyanna]] destroyed his fey pact stone. Japheth subsequently lost his fey-granted powers and then made a pact with the [[elder evil]] [[Nihal]], becoming a [[Warlock#Star pact warlock|star-pact warlock]].

==Relationships==
Japheth was quite taken by the young woman [[Anusha Marhana]]. At first denying the relationship because his past and his later situation, he came to realize Anusha had claimed his heart.

==Abilities==
He had an unknown spell that created and hurled a red-hot spear at a target.

He could summon and merge his consciousness with a swarm of [[bat]]s from [[Darroch Castle]] through his cloak.

He knew the spell ''[[crown of madness]].''

He knew the ''[[magic mouth]]'' [[ritual]].

Japheth could create a [[construct]] out of simple materials, such as his [[scarecrow]] made of dockside debris. This scarecrow also had a ''magic mouth'' spell placed on it.

After forming a star pact, Japheth often employed ''[[steps on the purple stair]]''. He could also call on ''[[rending fear of Khirad]]'',{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||14}} and ''[[blaze of Ulban]]''.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP|12,18}}
