Quilynn Midler was a member of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.
Quilynn was a middle-aged woman with tan skin and long blonde hair.
Quilynn was the daughter of Ianhand and Neris Midler, and sister of Ricnan. She was the aunt of Ricnans sons Normon and Thoben.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.
Quilynn was held captive in the kitchen of the house, alongside Ricnan and Normon, guarded by several drow invaders.
