'''Brevin''' was a [[gnome]] who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|Won't be laughing. Won't be laughing when I'm a watchman.|Closed Mind's thoughts.}}

==History==
Brevin lived in Baldur's Gate and he was determined to become a member of [[The Watch|Baldur's Gate's City Watch]], but he was constantly confronted by prejudices regarding his race.

In the late 15{{th}} century, Brevin got wind of a "training camp" organized by [[Enver Gortash]] that supposedly could help him make his way into the Watch. Brevin enrolled in it, but he did not get what he was looking for. Instead, his brain was extracted for experiments or usage in the [[Steel watcher|Steel Watch project]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Brevin's brain was put into a [[brain jar]] named '''Closed Mind''' that could be found in the [[Necrotic Laboratory]] of the [[Mind Flayer Colony]] beneath [[Moonrise Towers]].
