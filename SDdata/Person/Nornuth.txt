'''Nornuth''' was a [[horse]] breeder and a stable master in the town of [[Espar]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Nornuth was the town's horse breeder by the {{YearlinkName|1348}}. Following the [[Battle of Hunter's Hollow]] that same year, Nornuth, along with his friends [[Thorl Battlestorm]] and [[Barth the Barrelhead]], discussed the newly celebrated hero who famously saved King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s life. Nornuth complimented the young man on his knowledge of forests, [[ranger]] skills, and his good looks. Promptly, his friends compared the heroic [[Florin Falconhand]] to young Nornuth, who was just as popular among women and had numerous consorts in the old days. [[Imsra Skydusk]], Florin's mother, joined that conversation, voicing worries about her son's future.
