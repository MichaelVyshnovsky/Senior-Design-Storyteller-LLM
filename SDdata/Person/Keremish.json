        "mainbody": "'''Keremish''' was a [[vampire]] criminal and extortionist from the town of [[Skull Crag]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], the legendary set of [[enchanted]] items known as the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' were lost to a monster attack after the local hero [[Arelin Starbrow]]'s death. Subsequently, the set was recovered by a group of [[adventurer]]s. When Keremish learned about the retrieval, he used his vampiric gifts to lure and kidnap the aged husband of Arelin Starbrow, [[Morudel]] of [[Marsember]]. The vampire dragged the prisoner to a ruined [[hin]] village southeast of Skull Crag across the [[Tunlands]]. Members of Keremish's gang issued demands to Arelin's children for the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' in exchange for Morudel's life. The Roadwarden Guard intentionally stretched the negotiations out to buy time for the adventurers to rescue the hostage.\n\nThe group investigated the kidnapping and stumbled upon a group of thieves whispering about the old halfling village, and they followed the clue. There, the adventurers slew [[ettin]]s working for the vampire and many members of the gang, eventually confronting and slaying Keremish."
