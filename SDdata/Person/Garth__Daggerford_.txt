Garth was a member of the Delimbiyr family inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His house was located along Rogar Alley in western Daggerford near the Caravan Gate. His family sent him out into the world to become an adventurer in order to keep him from drinking away all of the profits of their wine cellars at the River Shining Tavern.
