'''Bobrik Highmantle''' was a regular patron of the [[Beached Leviathan]], one of the most popular taverns of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|59}}

==Activities==
Bobrik was known as the "bosun" of the Beached Leviathan because he was like a permanent fixture in the tavern, spending all his time drinking. Bobrik was respected and feared by the other patrons for his ill temper, and only the owner of the Beached Leviathan, [[Harrag]], dared to call him "the bosun" in a loud voice.

==Trivia==
Bobrik had a [[monkey]] pet he had named "Monkey".
