Amrath Mulnobar was the castellan of Noanars Hold until sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Amrath was the castellan of the Hunt Lords keep, serving them from before they entered into a pact with Orcus and became wights.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Amrath still remained as castellan in the keep.
