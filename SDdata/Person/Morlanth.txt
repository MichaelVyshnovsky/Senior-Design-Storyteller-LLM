'''Morlanth''' was a [[necromancer]] [[wizard]] in the [[Shard of Night]] above [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
Morlanth was the apprentice of the [[lich]] [[Arklem Greeth]] during his time as leader of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. Arklem sent Morlanth to [[Neverwinter]] in search of an [[artifact]] known as the [[Shroud of Souls]] that could be used to call upon the spirits of the dead. Morlanth found the Shroud within a [[Kelemvor]]ite crypt in the city's [[River District]], but the crypt's wards trapped her within. Over time, the magic of the Shroud transformed her into a [[shade]].

Over a century later, the [[illusionist]] [[Lukan]] accidentally breached the crypt's wards, freeing Morlanth. Allying herself with the [[Netherese]], Morlanth took up residence within the [[Shard of Night]] and planned to use the Shroud of Souls to raise the [[Neverwinter Nine]] as [[wraith]]s under her control. She was ultimately slain by the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge, who recovered the Shroud of Souls before she could finish her ritual.
