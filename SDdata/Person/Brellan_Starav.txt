Brellan Starav was the Commander of the Order of the Golden Cup in Damara as of  DR.
In 1373 DR, Brellan Starav was amongst the audience to which Pavel Shemov explained the situation regarding Zhengyis impersonation by Sammaster. The commander was against aiding him, for he had consorted with Brimstone, but the queen overruled him. He was not chosen to aid the vampires foray into the Plane of Shadow, however, as the queen preferred some of the top knights remain behind in case of failure.
Once Gareth Dragonsbane was returned, he was involved in the planning of his rout of the Bandit Army of Vaasa.
