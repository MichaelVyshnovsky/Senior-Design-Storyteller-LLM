'''Brellan Starav''' was the Commander of the [[Order of the Golden Cup]] in [[Damara]] as of {{yearlink|1373}} DR.{{cite book/The Rage}}

==History==
In 1373 DR, Brellan Starav was amongst the audience to which [[Pavel Shemov]] explained the situation regarding [[Zhengyi]]'s impersonation by [[Sammaster]]. The commander was against aiding him, for he had consorted with [[Brimstone (drake)|Brimstone]], but the queen overruled him. He was not chosen to aid the vampire's foray into the [[Plane of Shadow]], however, as the queen preferred some of the top knights remain behind in case of failure.

Once Gareth Dragonsbane was returned, he was involved in the planning of his rout of the [[Bandit Army]] of [[Vaasa]].
