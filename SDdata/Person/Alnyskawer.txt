==Relationships==
He was familiar with the locals Baerdagh and Caladaster Daermree, knowing they were too skint to pay up.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|663-664|13}}

==History==
Alnyskawer personally served a wandering [[Elminster Aumar]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, when the latter was fishing for information on [[Sharindala]]'s [[Scorchstone Hall]] in Ripplestones and wanted to tempt local seniors [[Baerdagh]] and [[Caladaster Daermree]] into talking. He put down a large feast for Elminster, who paid up front.

Alnyskawer was also personally serving on the day when a [[Harper]] [[Azuth|giving no name]] and the sages [[Tabarast]] and [[Beldrune]] rode into Ripplestones. He made litte conversation, and also took notice later that Baerdagh was also known as the Lion of [[Elversult]]. He then asked him to recount at least one old war tale.
