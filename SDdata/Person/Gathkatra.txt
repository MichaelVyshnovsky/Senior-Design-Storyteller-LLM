Gathkatra was an ogre mage that masqueraded as a human female and worked as the chatelaine of the Whistling Wizard inn on the outskirts of Voonlar circa the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR.
In the late 1350s DR, the Whistling Wizard had become a haven and meeting place for many of the more evilly-inclined religious, mercantile, and political groups in the Moonsea region. The owner at the time was Ravvas Thurrpurtyn who seemed to tolerate these elements in his establishment, perhaps even courting favor with them. For unknown reasons, Gathkatra was attracted to this activity or atmosphere and arranged an accident to eliminate the current hostess of the Wizard. Then, polymorphed into a human female, Gathkatra applied for the job and became the new chatelaine.
Gathkatras presence at the Whistling Wizard was one of many concerns that worried Zarracee Ambroanye, the spectral harpist that haunted the Wizard Well, located in the cellar of the inn. She eventually called for help, asking that the inn be purged of the many duplicitous characters living there. This precipitated the conflict that became known as the Battle at the Bar.
