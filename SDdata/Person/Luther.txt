'''Luther''' was an ancient beloved Magister hero of [[Myth Drannor]] who died long before the advent of the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Luther owned a unique enchanted ''[[ring of the protected]]'', which served him in life and was buried with the Magister after death.

==History==
Magister Luther perished many centuries before his final resting place in the [[Elven Catacombs]] was disturbed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their [[drow]] [[House Freth]] allies in [[1369 DR]]. His body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside [[Arianna]] the Archer, [[Erik Sliphand]], [[Sindar]], [[Bannoc]], and [[Shyla]]. Their sarcophagi were corrupted by the wild magics unleashed during the Weeping War. The Magister, and other heroes he shared the tomb with became cursed with the [[undead]] existence as [[wraith]]s, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with.
