'''Heggr Splitsteel''' was a dwarven weapon merchant who sold wares in the [[Underdark]] in the late 13th and early 14th centuries [[DR]].

==Personality==
Heggr sold wares in the area south of a [[House Despana]] camp, near [[Rilauven]]. The weapons merchant sold a variety of weapons, included magically enhanced ones.

Heggr set up trade with a derro savant ([[Myrvek of Gracklstugh|Myrvek]]) and a drow ([[Wode the Guileful|Wode]]), despite their races not typically getting along. He made it clear that he wouldn't let "ancient grudges stand in the way of good coin". These mercantile tactics gave his clan the edge in trading. It was noted by Wode, however, that he didn't like being associated with his fellow traders. Furthermore, if he was found out by his clan, he would have been exiled. Despite this, he often engaged in banter with Myrvek and Wode.

The dwarf was particularly religious, being a priest of Abbathor. He didn't like his clan name to be revealed, and would curse those in the name of Abbathor and [[Clangeddin Silverbeard|Clangeddin]], if they revealed it. He, himself, was poor at keeping secrets.

Heggr used a warhammer and shield to fight.
