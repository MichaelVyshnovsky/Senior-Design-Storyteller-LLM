'''Divine Simfray''' was a matron mother in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Divine ruled [[House Simfray]] in [[Menzoberranzan]], a very small house. However, she acquired the services of a very talented weapon master, [[Zaknafein]].

In [[1018 DR]], House Simfray was attacked by [[House Tr'arach]]. Meanwhile, [[Arathis Hune]] and [[Jarlaxle]] were hired by Matron Mother [[Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin]] to deliver the weapon master Zaknafein to Matron [[Malice Do'Urden|Malice]] of [[House Do'Urden]]. In the last moments of the battle, Arathis infiltrated Divine's private room, killing the guards, and confronted the matron mother. He offered to Divine a chance to join [[Bregan D'aerthe]] but she refused and the assassin quickly hit her with his poisoned sword, killing her.
