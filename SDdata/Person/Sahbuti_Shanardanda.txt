'''Sahbuti Shanardanda''' was [[human]] [[monk]] and member of the [[Dark Moon]] monastic order in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Sahbuti was terse, to-the-point, and had an abiding loneliness and bitterness that he felt would only be relieved once he was dead and [[Shar]] extinguished his being. He was also very confident, and brooked no criticism of his abilities and quickly accepted duels. Like all of his brethren, he was a staunch opponent of [[Sel√ªne]].

==Abilities==
As a skilled monk, [[shadowdancer]], and [[sorcerer]], Sahbuti had a wide range of skills and abilities. He was an expert melee fighter with weapons and his own body, stealthy even in plain sight, and was able to support his actions with an array of sorcerous spells that were of lesser power, though very useful.

==Possessions==
He wore ''[[bracers of armor|armcloths of armor]] +4'', a ''[[monk's belt]]'', and carried a masterwork [[bastard sword]]. He also possessed permanent ''[[magic fang]]'' spells on his hands and feet, gifted from another of the faithful.

==Relationships==
Sahbuti loved nothing and no one, with his only companion the living [[shadow]] named '''Shemnaer''' who he knew was loyal, but didn't treat with any kind of familiarity.

==History==
Sahbuti was born and raised in [[Amn]], and taught the worship of Shar while very young. Around [[1472 DR]], Sahbuti traveled the [[Sword Coast]] from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Calimshan]], doing the work of his goddess. Adept at arriving at exactly the place where he was needed most, he escorted Dark Moon officials, guarded valuable shipments for the church, and occasionally assassinated Shar's enemies.
