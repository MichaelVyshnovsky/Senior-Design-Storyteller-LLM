        "mainbody": "Nadron Ilanis was a cleric of Anu. He served sheik Kassim Arslan of the Oasis of the White Palm.\nNadron was loyal to the sheik. He seldom spoke with outsiders, and had a fanatical hatred of idol worshipers.\nNadron wore a cloak of protection and carried a staff of curing. He also had three scrolls pocketed one of neutralize poison, one of raise dead and one of blade barrier.\nAt the clerical tent, Nadron had a statue of solid silver, worth as much as 3000 gp. The statue had a lock securing it to its altar. In his own personal section  of the tent, Nadron had a chest buried in a shallow hole under his sleeping mat. Inside the chest, Nadron kept a hooded cobra as a guardian, and also 1500 ep, 600 gp, and 3 pieces of jewelry worth 400 gp.\nWhile of optimal wisdom for a cleric, the clerics charisma was his one truly outstanding trait.\nNadron knew that the symbol on the palm of Princess Shadalah came from a tradition almost as old as the tribe itself. The cleric considered that the mark appearing on the brides hand was a superstition only important because of tradition, which stated that the mark had great power over evil. He understood its significance, however, realizing that since the symbol had not returned to the altar, the bride should be alive.\nNadron was skeptical of the sheiks belief that the Oasis of the White Palm had been the tribes ancestral homeland just because of writings inside the old temple in the compound. He also knew that if one planted a date from the white palm tree while praying to Anu, a new palm tree would spring up and grow to full size in only a week."
