        "mainbody": "ack Boosenburry was a gnomish illusionist and a cleric of Baervan Wildwanderer, active circa 1312 DR.\nIn the , Zack Boosenburry traveled to a newly erected ice temple of Auril in Icewind Dale. Zack attempted to investigate the strange structure for personal reasons along with his huge spider mount named Aocha‎‎. Inside, he was collecting information on the temple and was taking copious notes. As Boosenburry was meditating on his notes, he did not notice the approaching cultists of Auril and their tamed arctic beasts. Before the gnome could do anything, he was swallowed whole by a remorhaz. Zack spent several days inside the beast, keeping himself alive through prayers to Baervan Wildwanderer. He managed to annoy the worm from the inside by kicking and punching enough for the remorhaz to belch out a note – a plea for help from Zack. Eventually, his spells almost completely spent, Zack Boosenburry managed to put the remorhaz to sleep in time to be rescued by a group of mercenaries from Targos. Later, they helped the gnome to reunite with his spider Aocha‎‎ and in exchange for information on the temple, he offered the adventurers his collection of potions and spells for trade."
