Nilunele Gudelmer was a member of the Gudelmer merchant family and a daughter of Albaerlus Gudelmer who resided in Athkatla in the late 14 century DR.
Like her sister, Nilunele Gudelmer was a smart, astute, and charming woman. Among her family, Nilunele was the most adventurous and eager to partake in bold affairs.
By the late 14 century DR, Nilunele Gudelmer had three siblings, all sisters. Iylandra and Raeveshara Gudelmer were the older siblings, while Quaerthara Gudelmer was Niluneles younger twin. The sisters lived with their father, Albaerlus, in the family mansion, famously haunted and beautiful Dancing Dolphins House in Athkatlas resplendent Gem District. All four sisters were professional escorts and guides to Athkatla, offering their services to visitors in need of companionship. The Gudelmer sisters were well-known in Athkatlas upper classes through their social status and professional life. Niluneles natural thrill-seeking personality and devil-may-care attitude often made her the first choice to be hired to wear disguises and aid in various illicit activities.
