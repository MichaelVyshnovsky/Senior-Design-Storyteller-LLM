'''Nilunele Gudelmer''' was a member of the [[Gudelmer]] merchant family and a daughter of [[Albaerlus Gudelmer]] who resided in [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Like her sister, Nilunele Gudelmer was a smart, astute, and charming woman. Among her family, Nilunele was the most adventurous and eager to partake in bold affairs.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Nilunele Gudelmer had three siblings, all sisters. [[Iylandra Gudelmer|Iylandra]] and [[Raeveshara Gudelmer]] were the older siblings, while [[Quaerthara Gudelmer]] was Nilunele's younger twin. The sisters lived with their father, Albaerlus, in the family mansion, famously haunted and beautiful [[Dancing Dolphins House]] in Athkatla's resplendent [[Athkatla/Gem District|Gem District]]. All four sisters were professional escorts and guides to Athkatla, offering their services to visitors in need of companionship. The Gudelmer sisters were well-known in Athkatla's upper classes through their social status and professional life. Nilunele's natural thrill-seeking personality and devil-may-care attitude often made her the first choice to be hired to wear disguises and aid in various illicit activities.
