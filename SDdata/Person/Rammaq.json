        "History": "Originating in the [[Time of Giants]], Rammaq had long worked to ascend in power as a [[demigod]], but without success. Eventually, Rammaq sought to possess a number of tomes—the ''[[Tome of Ka'Tai]]'' and the ''[[Tome of the Dolorous Sage]]''—kept within [[Fugue Plane#Eternity's End|Eternity's End]] on the [[Fugue Plane]], believing they would help him attain apotheosis, and so he became a lieutenant of [[Akachi]] in his [[Betrayer's Crusade|crusade]] against the god [[Myrkul]] himself. Though the crusade was foiled, Rammaq managed to flee Myrkul's wrath and continued to search for a means of becoming a god.\n\nAt the time of the [[Third Crusade]] in the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, Rammaq returned to the Fugue Plane to continue where Akachi left off and again try to locate the tomes. Following the first assault, Rammaq and his followers went to Eternity's End. After this, his fate is unconfirmed—the [[Kalach-Cha]] could have aided or thwarted or even destroyed the demilich. If they allowed the tomes to be lost, then Rammaq might suspect betrayal and attack, while if they recovered one or both tomes, then Rammaq would grant an [[undead]] minion to aid them at the [[Wall of the Faithless]], while Rammaq departed to work on his apotheosis. If he survived, and [[Kaelyn]] continued her own crusade against the Wall, then Rammaq would one day betray her."
