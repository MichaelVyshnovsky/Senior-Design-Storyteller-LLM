'''Khorsaya''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], and the ancestor of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]].

==Abilities==
Khorsaya was one of the few rare dragonborn of Abeir who could use [[arcane magic]].

==History==
Khorsaya was a slave of the [[dragon]] [[Emycharianatris]].

One day, Khorsaya drugged the favored son of Emycharianatris using a concoction made of her own fermented blood and [[magic]], and served in the skull of her father. Then, she killed the dragon and fled from slavery.

Eventually, Khorsaya became the posthumous matriarch of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
