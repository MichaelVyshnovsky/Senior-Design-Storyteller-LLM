Khorsaya was a dragonborn of Abeir, and the ancestor of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
Khorsaya was one of the few rare dragonborn of Abeir who could use arcane magic.
Khorsaya was a slave of the dragon Emycharianatris.
One day, Khorsaya drugged the favored son of Emycharianatris using a concoction made of her own fermented blood and magic, and served in the skull of her father. Then, she killed the dragon and fled from slavery.
Eventually, Khorsaya became the posthumous matriarch of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
