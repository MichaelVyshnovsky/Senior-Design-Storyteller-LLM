        "mainbody": "'''Digby''' was a no-good trapper, brother to [[Doogal]] and [[Dolan]], from the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Aye. Dingbat, Dumbbutt, and... whatever that other one be called. They be thugs, the worst kind o' scum. Emmerich knows they be up to no good. Only a matter o' time, says I.''|[[Young Ned]]}}",
        "Description": "Digby was a [[human]] male with light skin and light chestnut hair. Digby was known to overindulge on alcohol.",
        "Possessions": "He wore a set of simple [[leather armor]] and carried a [[dagger]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protector's rules. To [[Emmerich Hawk]]'s disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the [[Lonely Wood]] without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only care about skinning and selling as much as possible. Emmerich Hawk attempted to dissuade the trappers from their harmful practices, but the brothers considered the ranger to be just a crybaby who loved animals a bit too much. When a [[barbarian]] army approached Lonelywood in 1281 DR, Digby was not worried for the town's well-being; instead, he was happy to see all sorts of forest crutters being spooked by the barbarians and being sent running straight into the brothers' traps."
