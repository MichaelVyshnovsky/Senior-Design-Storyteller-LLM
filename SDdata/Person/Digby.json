        "mainbody": "igby was a no-good trapper, brother to Doogal and Dolan, from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.\nDigby was a human male with light skin and light chestnut hair. Digby was known to overindulge on alcohol.\nHe wore a set of simple leather armor and carried a dagger.\nIn the , three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protectors rules. To Emmerich Hawks disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the Lonely Wood without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only care about skinning and selling as much as possible. Emmerich Hawk attempted to dissuade the trappers from their harmful practices, but the brothers considered the ranger to be just a crybaby who loved animals a bit too much. When a barbarian army approached Lonelywood in 1281 DR, Digby was not worried for the towns well-being instead, he was happy to see all sorts of forest crutters being spooked by the barbarians and being sent running straight into the brothers traps."
