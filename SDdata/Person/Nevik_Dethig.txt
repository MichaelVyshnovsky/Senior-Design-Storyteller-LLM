NevikDethig was an aboleth in the Lake of Blood in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, having heard the whispers of the demon lord Grazzt, NevikDethig settled inside the Lake of Blood, quickly gaining some orc minions from Maerimydra.
When the allied factions attacked Maerimydra, the aboleth was confronted by an adventuring party supported by a mind flayer, Vilcuum.
NevikDethig was curious about the war at Maerimydra. He believed that no humanoid could harm him.
