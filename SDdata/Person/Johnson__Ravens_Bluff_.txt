Private Johnson was a low-ranking member of the City Watch in Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
On the 17 of Flamerule, , a group of adventurers who were asked to assist the temple of Mystra in Ravens Bluff – the Halls of Mystery, were involved in a scuffle and a battle on the streets of the city early in the morning. Shortly after, patrolman Private Johnson witnessed some unsavory elements running and even flying away from the area of the incident. Private Johnson ordered the individual to halt but was ignored. Johnson was joined by fellow patrolmen and chased the suspicious criminal to a rental room in a boarding house – later revealed to be the apartment of the Zhent mage Varken Hallos‎. Upon entry, Private Johnson witnessed someone disappearing in a flash of magic. Ulijaz Thenumbrin – the fleeing individual, was swiftly subdued by a lucky hit of Johnsons billy club straight to Ulijazs temple. Private Johnson later reported the event and aided the group of Mystran adventurers, giving them clues to pursue the Zhentarim agents to the town of Dragon Falls.
