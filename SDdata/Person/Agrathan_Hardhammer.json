        "mainbody": "'''Agrathan Hardhammer''' was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] of [[Dumathoin]] and a member of the [[Council of Sparkling Stones]] of [[Mirabar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He had soft features for a dwarf, and a long white beard. As the highest-ranking dwarf in Mirabar among the [[human]]s, he was also the voice of the dwarven population not only to the council, but to the [[Marchion]] as well. He often wore robes. He worked in the mines some time before [[1270 DR]] before taking up the priesthood.",
        "History": "Agrathan once devised a plan against [[Mithral Hall]] in which inferior charcoal would be swapped into their stores to hamper their industry.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], he was apparently the only dwarf on the council. During the rioting in the Undercity of Mirabar over the imprisonment of [[Torgar Hammerstriker]], Agrathan revealed to [[Shingles McRuff]] that he had known about the imprisonment and had done nothing, prompting Shingles to assault him, beating him to the ground.\n\nAgrathan played a large role in Mirabar's time of unrest between its dwarven and human populations from the very beginning. The majority of his time was spent trying to act as a voice of reason between the strongest proponents of the conflict: Torgar Hammerstriker and Marchion [[Elastul Raurym]]. He also faced great inner turmoil during the conflict, having to come to terms with and decide whether his loyalty was to his race or his city.\n\nAfter Torgar and around four hundred of Mirabar's dwarves chose to leave and make their homes among the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer, it was Agrathan who made the comment that few in all of [[Faer√ªn]] were more deserving of honor and respect then the dwarves of Mirabar."
