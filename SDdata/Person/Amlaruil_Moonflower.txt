'''Amlaruil Moonflower''' (sometimes known as the '''Sad Queen''' after the death of [[Zaor Moonflower|King Zaor Moonflower]]) was a [[moon elf]] and queen of the [[Elf|elven]] island of [[Evermeet]].

==History==
Born on [[Evermeet]] in the {{YearlinkName|611}}, Amlaruil eventually married Zaor Moonflower, King of Evermeet She earned the nickname of the "Sad Queen" after her husband was murdered and continued her life in a state of mourning.

By [[1367]], she was more than 700 years old. She was believed to have reached total harmony and understanding with the universe, something which no other elf had achieved. When faced with the choice of joining the [[Seldarine]] and her lost husband in [[Arvandor]] or staying behind, she chose to stay with her people.

As of [[1479 DR]], she was gone and her throne stood empty.

==Relationships==
===Family===
Amlaruil had an older brother, [[Giullio]], who preferred solitary study.

Amlaruil's first child was [[Ilyrana Moonflower|Ilyrana]], a priestess of [[Angharradh]]. The princess was followed by twins, [[Zhoron Moonflower|Zhoron]] and [[Xharlion Moonflower|Xharlion]], trained as fighters. [[Chozzaster Moonflower|Chozzaster]] was born after Amlaruil and Zaor wed, and he dedicated himself to magic. [[Shandalar Moonflower|Shandalar]] followed, and chose the path of the [[bladesinger]]. Next came the twins [[Tira'allara Moonflower|Tira'allara]] and [[Hhora Moonflower|Hhora]], who trained as priestesses of [[Hanali Celanil]]. Another set of female twins, [[Lazziar Moonflower|Lazziar]] and [[Gemstarzah Moonflower|Gemstarzah]] followed. Many years later, four more joined the family. [[Amnestria Moonflower|Amnestria]] loved the life of the solitary adventurer. [[Zandro Moonflower|Zandro]] and [[Finufaranell Moonflower|Finufaranell]] were mages and studied in the [[Towers]]. Last was [[Lamruil Moonflower|Lamruil]], a mischievous young man.

The fate of her children was a sad tale. Either Zhoron or Xharlion was devoured by the [[Ityak-Ortheel|Elf-Eater]], and the other's fate is unknown; both may have met this end. Lazziar and Gemstarzah vanished during a diplomatic mission. Chozzaster died young. Shandalar died during her bladesinger training. Tira'allera entered into a disastrous relationship with a noble elf, and died of heartbreak; Hhora married a chance-met commoner and disappeared into [[Faer√ªn]]. Ilyrana later took the Elf-Eater to Arvandor in the hopes of defeating it, it's unknown if she ever returned. Amnestria was banished by the nobility to the mainland after bearing a half-elven child ([[Arilyn Moonblade]]). The fates of Zandro and Finufaranell were not told. Lamruil, despite his early habits, successfully drew the [[King Sword]]. Upon Amlaruil's return to Evermeet, he left to build a kingdom in the distant north.

==Status==
Amlaruil was regarded so highly in the society of Evermeet that works of art, poems, and songs were dedicated to her, in number second only to the Seldarine.

==Possessions==
Amlaruil was able to ''[[teleport]]'' any approaching ships miles away from the island using the [[Accumulator]], a magical scepter that stores magical energy,

She also possessed two of the three [[Great Treasures of Evermeet]]: the magical sword ''[[Tahlshara]]'' and the ''[[Chalice of Labelas]]''. 

==Accommodation==
Amlaruil Moonflower lived in the [[Moonstone Palace]] above the city of [[Leuthilspar]] Although the Queen spent much of her time in the Moonstone Palace, she had a second home called the [[Summer Palace]] in the center of the [[Lake of Dreams]].

==Trivia==
Amlaruil often obtained her clothes from [[Shael]], the clothier in Leuthilspar.
