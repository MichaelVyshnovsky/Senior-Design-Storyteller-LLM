        "mainbody": "But she did come back, riding out of the swamp on the evening of [[Eleint 18]] and rescuing Jasper from a rogue [[hydra]]. Battling it on horseback, she chopped off three heads and stabbed it through the heart with her sword, but not before one head bit her thigh. Jasper threw rocks at it. Afterward, he was thankful and suggested she go to his master [[Benelaius]] to treat her injuries; she agreed, letting Jasper ride behind her. On the way, she put herself forward as a suspect for the murder of Grodoveth, who'd been found dead in Fastred's tomb with the treasure gone, and teased that if she had killed him she could kill Jasper too. But she hadn't, and she didn't. At the cottage, Kendra trusted Benelaius because he had almost a hundred cats and let him treat her wound.\n\nOver the next few days, Kendra stayed at the cottage with Benelaius, Jasper, and Lindavar while she recovered from her injury and blood loss.

        "Description": "She was tall with a fit and healthy figure with wide hips and slender waist, but also very big feet. She was considered rather beautiful. She had red hair, cut to the level of just beneath her chin. Her armor comprised a steel bustier-like [[breastplate]], mail [[legging]]s, a leather skirt slit up the front, and a broad belt with sheaths for various bladed weapons. She tied peacestrings on these in deference to [[Laws of Cormyr|Cormyrean law]]. Over this, she donned a heavy hooded [[cloak]], which had a hem weighted and lined with \"[[orc]] spikes\" as a trap.",
        "Personality": "{{fq\n| text   = He was a pig and a fool, and I for one am not sorry to see such men die.\n| source = Kendra, and not unreasonably either\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nKendra had a cold and stern attitude when she expected trouble, namely from men, so she usually had a cold and stern attitude. She despised men who were pigs and fools, declaring she'd kill them given the chance or let them die. Nevertheless, she accepted men who were respectful and didn't try to touch her where she did not wish and trusted a man who liked animals, especially [[cat]]s. She was relaxed and friendly when among good company. She admitted she could be a bit of a bully.",
        "Possessions": "She had her armor and weapons, including a knife and a [[sword]].\n\nShe had a [[horse]], a combat-trained steed named [[Darrun]].",
        "Abilities": "She was a skilled rider and swordswoman.",
        "History": "She came from outside Cormyr. As an adventurer, she travelled quite widely.\n\nKendra already had an impressive reputation when she came to [[Cormyr]] in [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. Her goal was to hunt for treasure in the [[Vast Swamp]], namely that of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]].\n\nOn [[Eleint 16]], Kendra rode from the city of [[Wheloon]] to the town of [[Ghars]]. That night, she stopped by the [[Bold Bard]] tavern and immediately received crude and unwelcome advances and insults from [[Dovo]], and she returned the insults. When he grabbed her arm, she put a knife to his throat and invited tavernkeeper [[Shortshanks]] to throw him out, though Kendra did most of the throwing. Dovo even threatened her, but fled from her anger. Shortly after, [[Grodoveth]] tried the same, subtler but no less crude before he left. Shortshanks apologized for his patrons and thereafter Kendra drank her [[Old One Eye]] in peace. After a few drinks, she left and camped out among a copse of trees south of town.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = That's what I do. You're a soldier, you soldier. I'm an adventuress, I adventure. Whee.\n| source = Kendra to Flim, telling it like it is\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nThe [[Eleint 17|next morning]], Kendra was accosted by two highwaymen, and left them dead. Riding to the Vast Swamp, she came upon the scene of Dovo's murder, which was being investigated by Captain [[Flim]] of the [[Purple Dragons]], [[Benelaius]], [[Lindavar]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], Doctor [[Braum]], and Mayor [[Tobald]]. Flim questioned her, and she mocked him. Naturally a suspect, Kendra said she would've gladly killed Dovo, but denied actually doing it—her alibi for the killing being busy killing two entirely separate thugs elsewhere, and besides she didn't use an axe. She left the men and rode away free into the Vast Swamp, promising to return to Ghars when she was done and inviting Jasper, whom she recognized from the Bold Bard, to raise a drink to her if she didn't.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Sometimes, one does foolhardy things just for the sheer joy of doing them.
