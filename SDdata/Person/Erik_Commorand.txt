Erik Commorand was Adrik Commorands twin brother. Both of them were mercenary sorcerers.
Both Erik and Adrik talked constantly about topics too esoteric for others to follow.
Erik had a staff, but it was destroyed by a red wizards lightning bolt.
They were a part of the caravan that Raidon Kane joined, perhaps hired as a concession to the rumors of increased activity from the Red Wizards along the River Umber. He helped defend the caravan against one such raid.
Once in Emmech, after Raidon Kane tried to hire them, he turned out to have only money enough for one. Erik agreed to remain in the city, looking for a boat to take them across the Sea of Fallen Stars, waiting for the two tendays that Raidons money could buy. When Adrik died, he knew that Erik would move on after that time.
