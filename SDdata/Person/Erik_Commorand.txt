'''Erik Commorand''' was [[Adrik Commorand]]'s twin brother. Both of them were mercenary [[sorcerer]]s.{{cite book/Stardeep|83-84|9}}

==Personality==
Both Erik and Adrik talked constantly about topics too esoteric for others to follow.{{cite book/Stardeep|83-84|9}}

==Possessions==
Erik had a staff, but it was destroyed by a red wizard's lightning bolt.

==History==
They were a part of the caravan that [[Raidon Kane]] joined, perhaps hired as a concession to the rumors of increased activity from the [[Red Wizards]] along the [[River Umber]]. He helped defend the caravan against one such raid.{{cite book/Stardeep|83-84|9}}

Once in [[Emmech]], after Raidon Kane tried to hire them, he turned out to have only money enough for one. Erik agreed to remain in the city, looking for a boat to take them across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], waiting for the two tendays that Raidon's money could buy.{{cite book/Stardeep|124-125|11}} When Adrik died, he knew that Erik would move on after that time.{{cite book/Stardeep|260-261|24}}
