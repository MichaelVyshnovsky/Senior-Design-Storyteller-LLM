        "mainbody": "'''Fflar Starbrow Melruth''', known posthumously as the '''Captain of True Valor''', was a captain of the [[Akh'Velahr]] who served the city of [[Myth Drannor]] for half a century in the late 7th and early 8{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{page needed}} He famously sacrificed his life in defense of his home city—earning himself a place in Myth Drannan legend. He was ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' hundreds of years later to serve Myth Drannor once again, when terrible fiends threatened all of elven-kind in the late 14{{th}} century. Fflar protected his restored home for several generations, having been given a second chance at a peaceful existence among the [[Tel-quessir]].\n\n{{Quote|I am here, Aulmpiter!

        "Relationships": "During his time as a captain of the Akh'Velahr, Fflar was served well by his loyal lieutenant [[Elkhazel Miritar]]. \n\nFflar was married to [[Sorenna Alydyrrin]] at the age of 80, and together the two had a son named [[Arafel Melruth|Arafel]]; both fled the besieged Myth Drannor before the city fell.\n\nAfter his resurrection, Fflar rode atop a roan-coated stallion by the name of [[Thunder (horse)|Thunder]].{{page needed}}",
        "History": {
            "Weeping War": "Fflar was one of one of several valiant elves who famously defended the city of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Weeping War]], fought against the fiendish [[Army of Darkness]] and culminating in the {{YearlinkName|714}}. During the Battle of [[Crownfrost Capture]], the last major engagement of the war, Fflar led some 400 elves in a successful retreat, ensuring that one third of the army survived its defeat. Arms-Major [[Olortynnal]] fell in that battle and it was said that his spirit lived on in Fflar after he took up Olortynnal's blade, ''Keryvian''.{{page needed}}\n\nFflar rallied what was left of the Akh’Velahr to make a last stand against the Army of Darkness as the beleaguered city was evacuated. He fought on as his forces dwindled. The conflict escalated to the [[Banes' Duel]] between the remnants of Myth Drannor's forces and those commanded by the supreme commander of the Army of Darkness, [[nycaloth]] general, [[Aulmpiter]].{{page needed}} The battle raged for two days before the two generals faced off against each other in single combat. Fflar and Aulmpiter slew each other on [[Flamerule]] 15, after which the last of the city’s defenders were slain defending the portals being used in the retreat to Semberholme as the city finally fell. Fflar's [[soul]] made its way to the elven afterlife in [[Arvandor]]. while other accounts state he was buried in the [[Warrior's Tomb]] outside Myth Drannor.",
            "Afterlife & Resurrection": "{{Quote|I think I know Corellon's will in this. You were not called back to live one hour, or one day, or one battle. You were called back to live, for as long as fate, chance, and your own heart allow.|[[Seiveril Miritar]], to Fflar.}}\n\n\nAlthough he had departed for Arvandor, the [[ghost]] of Fflar Starbrow remained on [[Toril]], haunting the north center of the second floor of the Warrior's Tomb. Unfortunately, he wasn't aware of his undead, ghostly state. Fflar mistook anyone who ventured into the tomb as an intruder, and attacked them, unless he was given direct proof that he had perished.\n\nOn [[Ches]] 20 of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, 666 years after the fall of Myth Drannor, Fflar Starbrow Melruth was resurrected by [[Seiveril Miritar]]. Captain Fflar was needed so that he could take up ''Keryvian'' in battle against the [[daemonfey]] assault on [[Evereska]] and other elven cities of [[Faerûn]].\n\nIt was during that conflict that the resurrected elven warrior met and joined forces with [[Araevin Teshurr]], [[Ilsevele Miritar]], and other heroes in the [[Elven Crusade]].{{page needed}}\n\nThe leaders of the Elven Crusade. Fflar included, were instrumental in the defeat of the daemonfey and the reestablishment of the realm of [[Cormanthyr]]. These events also led to the eventual betrothal of Fflar and Ilsevele Miritar, ending her previous betrothal to [[Araevin Teshurr]].",
            "Commander of Myth Drannor": "{{Quote|Be welcome all of you...we need every sword, or Myth Drannor is doomed.|Fflar, to [[Storm Silverhand]] and her allies.}}\n\n\nIn his second life, Fflar valiantly served as High Captain and commander of the army of restored Myth Drannor.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, the flying capital of the returned Empire of [[Netheril]]―[[Thultanthar]], known as Shade―loomed over Myth Drannor. Its dark [[arcanist]]s sought to siphon away the magic of the city's ''[[mythal]]'' for their own ends. Numerous battles broke out as the Netherese forces and their mercenary armies assailed the free people of Myth Drannor.\n\nHigh Captain Fflar led the charge, taking on any allies that would come to the city's defense. In one battle, Fflar and Coronal Ilsevele stood against a contingent of [[Sembia]]n mercenaries, along with a few brave elven knights, having ordered most of their soldiers to reinforce another of the city's wards. Fflar was spared a second death defending his city, when he, Ilsevele, and what remained of their people were magically ''[[portal]]led'' away from Myth Drannor to Semberholme by the Srinshee, moments before Thultanthar came crashing down atop Myth Drannor, destroying the city for a second time."

        "Rumors & Legends": "Skilled students of the School of Arms in Semberholme were referred to as \"Fflarrens\", a tribute to the captain's career as a martial instructor.\n\nFollowing his death in the Weeping War, the true identity of Fflar Starbrow Melruth became lost to the ages. Some tales told of a stalwart [[human]] paladin who slew the nycaloth general of the Army of Darkness, while others insisted he was a [[half-elven]] [[ranger]], or an elven [[bladesinger]]."
