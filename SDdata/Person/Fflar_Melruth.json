He famously sacrificed his life in defense of his home city—earning himself a place in Myth Drannan legend. He was resurrected hundreds of years later to serve Myth Drannor once again, when terrible fiends threatened all of elven-kind in the late 14 century. Fflar protected his restored home for several generations, having been given a second chance at a peaceful existence among the Tel-quessir.\nFflar was tall with broad shoulders, with russet hair and a broad, handsome face. He wore his hair in a braid. He had a grim-sounding voice.\nCaptain Fflar armored himself with a lacquered breastplate,\nFor a period of 19 days at the end of the Weeping War \nDuring his time as a captain of the AkhVelahr, Fflar was served well by his loyal lieutenant Elkhazel Miritar. \nFflar was married to Sorenna Alydyrrin at the age of 80, and together the two had a son named Arafel both fled the besieged Myth Drannor before the city fell.\nAfter his resurrection, Fflar rode atop a roan-coated stallion by the name of Thunder.\nFflar was born in Myth Drannor in the . As a young elf in his first century of life, Fflar was already an incredibly skilled warrior, and was named a captain in the Cormanthyrean AkhVelahr.\nWhen Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl passed on to Arvandor in the , the city of Myth Drannor entered into a collective time of sorrow, known as the Mourning Days. After the untimely death of Etargrims daughter two years later, a Claiming Ceremony was held to determine the next coronal. Absolute chaos broke out in the city. Alongside the Arms-Major, the young Captain Fflar did his best to maintain order, but the city only came to peace upon the intervention of the legendary Srinshee.\nFflar married his first wife Sorenna in the , Arafel.According to Cormanthyr Empire of the Elves, Captain Fflar returned home to attend his wife in 335 DR. This date was later retconned to a later date in the novel Final Gate, as the timeline of Fflars life was expanded upon.\nFflar was one of one of several valiant elves who famously defended the city of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War, fought against the fiendish Army of Darkness and culminating in the . During the Battle of Crownfrost Capture, the last major engagement of the war, Fflar led some 400 elves in a successful retreat, ensuring that one third of the army survived its defeat. Arms-Major Olortynnal fell in that battle and it was said that his spirit lived on in Fflar after he took up Olortynnals blade, Keryvian.\nFflar rallied what was left of the Akh’Velahr to make a last stand against the Army of Darkness as the beleaguered city was evacuated. He fought on as his forces dwindled. The conflict escalated to the Banes Duel between the remnants of Myth Drannors forces and those commanded by the supreme commander of the Army of Darkness, nycaloth general, Aulmpiter. The battle raged for two days before the two generals faced off against each other in single combat. Fflar and Aulmpiter slew each other on Flamerule 15, after which the last of the city’s defenders were slain defending the portals being used in the retreat to Semberholme as the city finally fell. Fflars soul made its way to the elven afterlife in Arvandor. while other accounts state he was buried in the Warriors Tomb outside Myth Drannor.\nAlthough he had departed for Arvandor, the ghost of Fflar Starbrow remained on Toril, haunting the north center of the second floor of the Warriors Tomb. Unfortunately, he wasnt aware of his undead, ghostly state. Fflar mistook anyone who ventured into the tomb as an intruder, and attacked them, unless he was given direct proof that he had perished.\nOn Ches 20 of the , 666 years after the fall of Myth Drannor, Fflar Starbrow Melruth was resurrected by Seiveril Miritar. Captain Fflar was needed so that he could take up Keryvian in battle against the daemonfey assault on Evereska and other elven cities of Faerûn.\nIt was during that conflict that the resurrected elven warrior met and joined forces with Araevin Teshurr, Ilsevele Miritar, and other heroes in the Elven Crusade.\nThe leaders of the Elven Crusade. Fflar included, were instrumental in the defeat of the daemonfey and the reestablishment of the realm of Cormanthyr. These events also led to the eventual betrothal of Fflar and Ilsevele Miritar, ending her previous betrothal to Araevin Teshurr.\nIn his second life, Fflar valiantly served as High Captain and commander of the army of restored Myth Drannor.\nIn the , the flying capital of the returned Empire of Netheril―Thultanthar, known as Shade―loomed over Myth Drannor. Its dark arcanists sought to siphon away the magic of the citys mythal for their own ends. Numerous battles broke out as the Netherese forces and their mercenary armies assailed the free people of Myth Drannor.\nHigh Captain Fflar led the charge, taking on any allies that would come to the citys defense. In one battle, Fflar and Coronal Ilsevele stood against a contingent of Sembian mercenaries, along with a few brave elven knights, having ordered most of their soldiers to reinforce another of the citys wards. Fflar was spared a second death defending his city, when he, Ilsevele, and what remained of their people were magically portalled away from Myth Drannor to Semberholme by the Srinshee, moments before Thultanthar came crashing down atop Myth Drannor, destroying the city for a second time.\nSkilled students of the School of Arms in Semberholme were referred to as \"Fflarrens\", a tribute to the captains career as a martial instructor.\nFollowing his death in the Weeping War, the true identity of Fflar Starbrow Melruth became lost to the ages. Some tales told of a stalwart human paladin who slew the nycaloth general of the Army of Darkness, while others insisted he was a half-elven ranger, or an elven bladesinger."
