'''Deputy Noric''' was one of the deputies of [[Bron]] [[Bourstag]] of [[Voonlar]] in the [[Moonsea]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].

==Personality==
Noric was an extremely quarrelsome person, with that quality perfectly matched by his laziness.

==History==
Deputy Noric was one of the oldest assistants of Voonlar's cruel Bron, who by the {{YearlinkName|1373}} was among the city's Deputies. ''Circa'' that year, Noric was often charged with guarding the [[Locktower]]'s entrance. Deputy Noric survived the invasion of Voonlar but the summoned [[fiend]]s of the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] of 1373 DR.
