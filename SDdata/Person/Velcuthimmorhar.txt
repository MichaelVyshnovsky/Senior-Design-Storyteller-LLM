'''Velcuthimmorhar''', also known as '''Hephaestus''', was a [[red dragon|red]] [[wyrm]] living in the mountains west of [[Mirabar]].

==History==
He resided had there for longer than even the [[dwarves]] could remember.

[[Drizzt Do'Urden]] once tricked Hephaestus by claiming to be [[Mergandevinasander]] of [[Chult]]—an old [[black dragon]] known to Hephaestus—and claimed that his lavender eyes, a trait shared between the two, proved it.

==Activities==
He earned his considerable pay by melting ores for merchants.

==Personality==
The dragon was lazy, somewhat stupid, and was overly proud. He described himself as Destroyer of Cockleby; Devourer of Ten Thousand Cattle; and He Who Crushed [[Angelander]] the Stupid Silver.

He was able to speak the [[Common]] tongue, but was not very perceptive when presented with duplicity.
