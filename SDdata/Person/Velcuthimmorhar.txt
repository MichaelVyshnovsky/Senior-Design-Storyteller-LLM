Velcuthimmorhar, also known as Hephaestus, was a red wyrm living in the mountains west of Mirabar.
He resided had there for longer than even the dwarves could remember.
Drizzt DoUrden once tricked Hephaestus by claiming to be Mergandevinasander of Chult—an old black dragon known to Hephaestus—and claimed that his lavender eyes, a trait shared between the two, proved it.
He earned his considerable pay by melting ores for merchants.
The dragon was lazy, somewhat stupid, and was overly proud. He described himself as Destroyer of Cockleby Devourer of Ten Thousand Cattle and He Who Crushed Angelander the Stupid Silver.
He was able to speak the Common tongue, but was not very perceptive when presented with duplicity.
