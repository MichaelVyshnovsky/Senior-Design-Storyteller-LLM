        "mainbody": "'''Athrogate''' was a [[dwarf]] warrior of some reputation in the [[Bloodstone Lands]]",
        "Description": "Athrogate had the stout and powerful build of a typical dwarf. He wore his black beard parted in the middle, with two long braids of straight hair running down to mid-chest, each tied off at the end with a band set with three sparkling blue gemstones, or occasionally tipped with dung. His bushy eyebrows nearly covered his brown, almost black eyes. He had large ears.\n\nHe wore a suit of armor, part leather, part plated, and covered with a myriad of buckles and straps.<ref> His twin [[morningstar]]s were tied in an X at his back, their handles reaching up and well beyond the back of his bushy hair.\n\nAthrogate (perhaps jokingly) explained to Jarlaxle that he was cursed by a wizard to live a long life and never to forget the hardship he went through. Thus, although few dwarves reached 300 years of age, Athrogate was about 370 years old as of [[1368 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Athrogate liked to speak in rhyming couplets, through he displayed this behavior less frequently as time went on, perhaps in consideration for his companions.",
        "History": {
            "Citadel Felbarr": "Athrogate's home was [[Citadel Felbarr]], a dwarven stronghold east of [[Mithral Hall]] and south of [[Citadel Adbar]]. An [[orc]] clan raided Felbarr and Athrogate's children and wife, [[Gerthalie]], were slain. When the call went out to reclaim Felbarr, Athrogate didn't answer and thus did not return when his fellow dwarves reclaimed Felbarr some 300 years later.",
            "Citadel of Assassins": "Instead, Athrogate became a supreme killer, an agent of the [[Tightpurse]] thieves guild of [[Heliogabalus]] and associated with the [[Citadel of Assassins]]. Thus, during his time in Damara, he was often accompanied by [[Canthan Doolittle]], a wizard of the Citadel of Assassins.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Athrogate became a member of a group of warriors chosen by Commander [[Ellery Dragonsbane]] to fight the legacy of [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King. This group included [[Artemis Entreri]] and [[Jarlaxle]]. Athrogate was subsequently arrested by the [[monk]] Grandmaster [[Kane]] and held in prison for a long time. He was freed when Entreri, now styling himself King Artemis the First, was captured by the [[paladin]] King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and Jarlaxle saved them.\n\n{{Sectstub}}",
            "Bregan D'aerthe": "After many adventures, Artemis parted ways with Jarlaxle, and Jarlaxle returned to [[Bregan D'aerthe]] with Athrogate. Over [[1376]]–[[1377 DR]], Athrogate proved instrumental in their plans for [[Luskan]], delaying the rogue [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] (and also proving quite a match for the skilled dark elf) from saving Captain [[Deudermont]] of ''[[Sea Sprite]]'', thus helping Luskan descend into chaos and opposing Deudermont's attempts to save Luskan.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Athrogate journeyed with Jarlaxle to a meeting with [[Mirabar]]'s [[marchion]] to broker a trade agreement. When Jarlaxle was contacted by the [[Ghost King]] via [[telepathy]] and decided he needed to return to [[Spirit Soaring]], Athrogate was sent into Mithral Hall under the guise of a dwarf with a cure for [[Catti-brie]], who was suffering from a madness brought on by the [[Spellplague]]. [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], Drizzt, and [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] all set out to Spirit Soaring. Before long, Jarlaxle and Athrogate revealed themselves to the travelers, who reluctantly agree to allow the pair to tag along.\n\nAt Spirit Soaring, the group met with the priest [[Cadderly Bonaduce]]. Soon after, they were beset by a minion of the Ghost King, who was a [[dracolich]] combined with the crystal shard [[Crenshinibon]]. The first time they battled the dracolich he was nearly defeated but took refuge on the [[Plane of Shadows]] to recuperate. Upon returning to the Material Plane, the heroes battled the Ghost King once again, only for him to return to the Plane of Shadows. This time, [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] followed and finished off the dracolich, only to take the title Ghost King and seal the breach for all eternity.\n\nMore than half a century later, Athrogate could be found still traveling with Jarlaxle and working for Bregan D'aerthe. Around [[1452 DR]], he and Jarlaxle journeyed to [[Gauntlgrym]] with [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and Athrogate was coerced (by the [[vampire]] [[Korvin Dor'crae]]) into pulling a lever that released the trapped [[primordial]], which subsequently destroyed much of [[Neverwinter]]. Athrogate regretted that mistake and was driven to fix it for fear of the wrath of [[Moradin]] after his death. He and Jarlaxle returned to Gauntlgrym with Drizzt Do'Urden and Bruenor Battlehammer and were able to re-imprison the primordial. In the process, Athrogate and Jarlaxle were believed dead, consumed by the primordial.\n\nHowever, Jarlaxle had in fact used his magic to save Athrogate and soon the two were back working for Bregan D'aerthe.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Jarlaxle, upon hearing news of the return of the [[Companions of the Hall]], sent Athrogate to [[Nesme]] to investigate \"problems with the marketplace.\" Athrogate did so, spending his free time hunting [[troll]]s in the [[Evermoors]]. However, Jarlaxle's real intent was for Athrogate to meet up with the Companions, which he did, defending Nesme against the [[orc]] hordes and joining them on their journey to [[Mithral Hall]]."
        },
        "Home": "''Circa'' [[1463 DR]], Jarlaxle and Athrogate had a home in Luskan on the second floor of an unremarkable two-story building.",
        "Skills": "Athrogate was able to speak the [[Goblin language]] fluently, albeit with a heavy accent.",
        "Possessions": "Athrogate wore a broad [[Belt (disambiguation)|belt]] adorned with metal lightning bolts,<ref> which was in fact a ''[[belt of storm giant strength]]''.\n\nHe fought with twin gray [[glassteel]] [[morning star]]s, with spiked metal heads attached to the ends of [[adamantine]] [[chain]]s.<ref group=\"note\"> Although the novels name Athrogate's weapons \"[[morning star]]s\", their descriptions are more like [[flail]]s, especially in D&D v.3.5 rules. However, in medieval weaponry, the name \"morning star\" mainly referred to the spiked ball head of a weapon, and this could be attached to a handle, similar to a mace, and sometimes to a chain, like a flail. Therefore this name and description are accurate. He called them ''[[Cracker and Whacker]]'' or ''Rotter and Slaughter,'' whichever suited him best. On command, the left-hand morning star, ''Cracker'', emitted from the small nubs on the striking ball a dark reddish and chalky fluid, the ichor of a [[rust monster]], which corroded other metals on contact. The right-hand morning star, ''Whacker'', coated itself with a clear, blue-gray and oily liquid known as [[oil of impact]]. Using thus enhanced weapons with first left then right strikes, Athrogate could smash anything from a portcullis to an [[iron golem]] into rust flakes.\n\nAthrogate was also given a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'' by Jarlaxle, in the form of a red [[hell boar]] named [[Snort]]. The figurine looked like a small red boar without skin covering its body. The summoned beast, a large red-skinned boar, was a creature from the fiery pits of the [[Nine Hells]]. Steam rose from its back and bursts of red flames erupted from its nostrils. The boar appeared with full saddle, was fierce and rode tirelessly into battle. Snort was able to keep pace with any conventional beast of burden such as a [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmare]] and covered tremendous ground. By stomping a hoof and snorting, the boar created a defensive ring of fire from its snout and body, which didn't really harm but rather distracted enemies enough for a charge of its rider.",
        "Relationships": "Athrograte considered Jarlaxle his close friend. The pair were practically inseparable, with Jarlaxle going through great efforts to save Athrogate a number of times.\n\nDuring the journey from Mithral Hall to Spirit Soaring, Athrogate and Thibbledorf Pwent forged a friendship, with each always proving to the other his battle prowess.\n\nAthrogate had great respect for Bruenor Battlehammer, whom he adventured with several times. He said once to Bruenor, when returning to Gauntlgrym, \"I walk ''aside'' Jarlaxle. Athrogate follows Athrogate, and none else. Except this time, just this time, when Athrogate follows King Bruenor.\""
