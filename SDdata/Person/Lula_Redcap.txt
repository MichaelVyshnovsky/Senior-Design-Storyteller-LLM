Lula Redcap was a moody teenager obsessed with vampires who resided in Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Lula Redcap was a teenage human girl with pale skin and dark hair. She had the air of detached cold beauty about her. She was always dressed in high black clothes that made her appear morose sinister than she actually was. 
Even though Lula came off as cold, she was inexperienced and sheltered. She had an obsession with vampires that was fueled by romanticizing the blood-sucking undead and her lacking of understanding of the complexities of life.
She acted as if she were an actual vampire, calling others mortals and harbored an attitude of forced disgust towards other living beings.
In 1372 DR, Lula Redcap was seen almost nightly skulking through the shadows of Daggerfords streets pretending to be a blood-sucking vampire. Some people claimed that Lula Redcap volunteered to wed an ancient drow vampire Sieronius Dethick or even was taken by the creature of the night against her will.
