        "mainbody": "'''Tharim Roaringhorn''' was a member of the noble [[House Roaringhorn]] in [[Cormyr]], and was head of the family in the early 1200s [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Tharim was a husky man with dark brown eyes. His hair was an unbound mane of long brown locks and he sported a large, bushy mustache.",
        "Personality": "True to the reputation of House Roaringhorn (or perhaps the origin of it), Tharim was loud and boisterous, both on and off the battlefield. His irrepressible spirit was a boost for morale in battle (he actually roared and laughed while fighting), but in the [[Castle Obarskyr|Royal Court]] many courtiers found him annoying and disruptive.",
        "Abilities": "Tharim was a great warrior, skilled in both the [[warhammer]] and the [[battleaxe]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1227}}, Tharim Roaringhorn was part of an escort sent by the Crown to ensure the safety of a [[Sembian]] trade representative on a journey to [[Immersea]]. During the night, while the small force made camp, an enclosed wagon came careening down the road with no warning, striking and killing Tharim and [[Elbryn Scatterstars]] in its dash through the dark. [[Orngrym Cormaeril]] and [[Ardagast Falconhand]] gave chase by separate routes, but Orngrym could not track the wagon in the gloom and Ardagast was nearly killed when he was unhorsed by a [[spear]] thrust from a window on the carriage. They were later to learn that it was a hijacked pay-wagon carrying the wages for the [[Purple Dragons]]. [[Waevor's Wagon]] (as it was eventually named), its contents, and the guards and [[War Wizards]] that were protecting it were never seen again.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Tharim was a legend on the battlefield, said to mow down [[orcs]] like sheaves of wheat."
