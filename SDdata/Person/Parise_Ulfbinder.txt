Parise Ulfbinder was a lord of Netheril.
Parise Ulfbinder was friends with Draygo Quick, another Netherese noble. For a time Parise wondered if Drizzt DoUrden was the Chosen of Lolth, although he later rescinded that idea in favor of Dahlia Sinfelle being favored of Lolth.
Parise was also acquainted with Lady Avelyere, with whom he watched the re-acquaintance of the Companions of the Hall on Kelvins Cairn on 19 Ches 1484 DR.
