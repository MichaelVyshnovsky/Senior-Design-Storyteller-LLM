'''Parise Ulfbinder''' was a lord of [[Netheril]].

==Relationships==
Parise Ulfbinder was friends with [[Draygo Quick]], another Netherese noble. For a time Parise wondered if Drizzt Do'Urden was the Chosen of [[Lolth]], although he later rescinded that idea in favor of [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] being favored of Lolth.

Parise was also acquainted with Lady [[Avelyere]], with whom he watched the re-acquaintance of the [[Companions of the Hall]] on [[Kelvin's Cairn]] on 19 [[Ches]] [[1484 DR]].
