        "mainbody": "ntharl Danthelon was the dwarf proprietor of Danthelons Dancing Axe in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nDanthelon was a shield dwarf with a blonde beard who was often in high spirits. He kept his face clean-shaven, hair – styled and groomed, and wore fine clothes. In case of trouble, Entharl carried a crossbow.\nThe blonde dwarf sold second-hand goods, from armor and weapons, to mundane coils of rope.\nthumb|Entharl Danthelon getting ready to defend himself.\nIn the early 1480s DR, Entharl rented out parts of his residence to others, such as the wizard, Yssra Brackrel. Though Entharl claimed an animated \"dancing\" axe was gifted to him by an elf princess during his time as an adventurer, it was actually Brackrels illusion that cloaked a stirge.\nIn 1492 DR, he was preoccupied with reports of smugglers that went missing in the Riverveins tunnels. He encouraged his shoppers to seek out the smugglers, who were said to have been carrying a potion-filled chest. During the same period of time, Entharl Danthelon was secretly affiliated with the Harpers, grating them the use of the shops cellar. Entharl and his hired bodyguards ensured the safehouse remained unmolested by the city guard and the steel watchers. Due to that affiliation, the dwarf was familiar with the High Harper of Baldurs Gate – Jaheira, whom he called \"oaken maiden.\" At one point, a group of doppelgangers impersonated Harper agents in attempts to ambush Jaheira within the safehouse.\nWhen the city of Baldurs Gate started mandating donations to fight with the Absolute crisis, Entharl Danthelon donated three sets of worn travel cookware and utensils on at least one occasion."
