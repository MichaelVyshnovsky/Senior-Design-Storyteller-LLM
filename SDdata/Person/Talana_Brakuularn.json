        "mainbody": "Talana Brakulaarn was the Magister from  to . She was responsible for inventing the Magefair.\nTalana was large-girthed.\nShe was short-tempered, efficient, and loved both to organize affairs and to take charge.\nUpon becoming Magister, Talana had an appropriately haughty blazon made for her.\nMeasured against journeymen and novices, she was indeed superior.\nTalana had organized a high-society mages guild as an informal club with her at the head. She discouraged self-experimentation and dangerous castings, out of line with their standing in the club. She also encouraged magic be shared with the other members, though she denied it to all those who displeased or defied her.\nIn response to the growing resentment against her for controlling other mages supply of magic, Talana Brakulaarn organized the first MageFair, within the Shoon Imperium, in .Per the cited source, she was made Magister barely a month before the second Magefair the next paragraph explains she perished at the fair, while her date of death is given as 256 DR. However, the book also says she was the Magister from 249 to 256. As seven years is much longer than a month, this article assumes that she did not die at the second MageFair, but that other fairs were held between the second and the one of her death, while the implication that she died at the second fair is only an accident of editing. Sixty people attended, most of them journeymen and apprentices. Some of them were agents of the Shoon Imperium looking for dangerous wizards or magic worth seizing, who recommended her that she host the next one in Calimshan or Amn, to help expand her enterprise. She agreed, and made sure to advertise her coming Fair thoroughly. She became the Magister shortly before the next MageFair, hours after the death of the last Magister.\nWhile on a fair, someone slew her in her bed the assailant was himself slain, and so was his assailant. Ten or eleven mages slaying mages later, the last assailant staggered back to bed when a second man took notice of his wounds, the attacker polymorphed himself into a lizard man and attacked. A third mage, Eirl Rauthantannar, slew the lizard man and became the next Magister.\nThere was evidence that Talanas killer pretended to be a mage smitten with her charms."
