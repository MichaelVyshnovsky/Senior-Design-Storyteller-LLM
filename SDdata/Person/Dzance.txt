'''Dzance''' was a [[ranger]] of [[the North]] who retired in [[Silverymoon]] after his years spent adventuring across the Realms.

==History==
At some point in his adventuring career, Dzance explored the depths of the ancient [[dwarven]] city of [[Gauntlgrym]]. While exploring the former capital of [[Delzoun]], he recovered a [[magic]]al [[shield]] within a chest that came to be called ''[[Dzance's guardian]]''.

When the veteran ranger finally retired in the "Gem of the North", Dzance gifted his namesake shield to the young knight of the city, [[Belpir]], before [[1357 DR]].
