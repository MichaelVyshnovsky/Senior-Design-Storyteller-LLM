        "mainbody": "'''Sharna Quirstiron''' was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] agent of the [[Zhentarim]] who became the guildmaster of the [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]] toward the end of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Sharna was one of the more influential residents of [[Phandalin]], as well as one of the most capable fighter in town. She was a member of a splinter faction of the Zhentarim loyal to [[Manshoon]].",
        "Personality": "On the surface, Sharna was feisty and gregarious, always looking for opportunities to create new business partnerships or to hire capable adventurers to keep the local mines safe. However, in truth this was just a very good act. Sharna was completely evil and highly manipulative, and her eagerness to form new relationships was merely a means to ingratiate herself to powerful or dangerous individuals. That said, Sharna genuinely cared about making Phandalin a prosperous town, although only because she anticipated that this would make it more valuable to her Zhent superiors in the future.",
        "Activities": "As overseer of the [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]], Sharna's responsibilities included paying the miners and keeping records of their claims, but her principle goal was to revitalize the local mining industry. In addition, she secretly plotted to turn the Exchange into the dominant economic power in the town. and took steps to undermine those she saw as competition. All of this was in service of ultimately turning Phandalin into a hub for her splinter faction of the Zhentarim.",
        "Relationships": "Sharna was strictly dedicated to the Manshoon sect of the Zhentarim above all others. She was a party to the murder of [[Halia Thornton]], the former Zhentarim operative in Phandalin, so that she could take Halia's place and advance the goals of her sect.\n\nAs overseer of the Miner's Exchange, Sharna had quickly earned the admiration of the local miners who trusted her assurances that she could improve their livelihoods. These miners were quick to side with her in any confrontation, and she could easily steer them against rivals by claiming that they threatened the mines' future prosperity. Anyone who threatened her ability to keep the miners reliant on her was seen as a threat.\n\nSharna's aspirations of economic dominance put her at odds with any competitors, such as [[Linene Graywind]] at the local [[Lionshield Coster (Phandalin)|Lionshield Coster]]. She also sought to undermine or even eliminate [[Harbin Wester]], a wealthy local banker and the largest landowner in Phandalin, to usurp his many resources.\n\nShe maintained a team of four bodyguards to keep her operations secure, rough up any uncooperative miners, and do her dirty work.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1496}},{{AI-time}} Sharna's sect of the Zhentarim killed the old Zhent agent in Phandalin, Halia Thornton, and sent Sharna to replace her with the goal of grooming the town to be a safe-haven for their faction. Sharna quickly took over Halia's job at the Phandalin Miner's Exchange, claiming that her predecessor had left town seeking other work after her failure to make the mines profitable, The evil dwarf then set about trying to establish dominance in the town through economic and physical intimidation and manipulation."
