Ullvor Mharivven was the Guildmaster of the Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR.
Ullvor was a human man with dark and handsome features. His thin frame was decorated with foppish clothes of the latest fashions. He often was seen wearing maroon cloaks and high boots. His clothes were as fine if not more so than most nobles of Suzail.
His large personality was accented by his sharp tongue and cutting remarks, as well as his love for theatrics.
At one point early in his career, Ullvor Mharivven commissioned a spell and an enchanted finger-ring to be created for his guilds headquarters in Suzailâ€”the Hardshutters House. The spell was similar to the blade barrier spell that animated a collection of sharp glass shards hidden in the guildhouses attic and was activated through the ring.
Under his guidance, the Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild organized exhibits to show off the crafts of his tradesmen. Magnificent displays of stained glass, windows, and "gingerbread" roofing trims were presented to the high and mighty people of Suzail in attempts to create new fads and fashions in the guilds industry.
Apart from the guild activities, Ullvor Mharivven spread rumors of hauntings in Suzail only to purchase buildings for cheap later. These houses were gutted, renovated, or rebuilt to be sold at a gain.
