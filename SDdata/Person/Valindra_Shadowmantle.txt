==Personality==
Valindra never felt the same respect for community that other [[moon elves]] shared. She grew into a self-absorbed individual who cared little for anything that wasn't connected to her own interests or goals. Her arrogance, however, made her prone to underestimating her enemies.

As a [[lich]], she was described as strong-willed, deeply ambitious, and utterly ruthless. She believed the ends justified the means, and because of that she allied with Szass Tam of her own free will. She also became reckless, almost suicidal, because she believed that while her [[phylactery]] was in safe location, she was almost immortal.

==History==
She was born in the {{yearlinkName|1225}} in the [[High Forest]], where she trained as a [[wizard]]. Frustrated with the slow pace of her education, she left her homeland in the {{yearlinkName|1322}} to pursue her own goals. Valindra made her way to [[Mirabar]] where she found little trouble persuading a trusting old wizard to take her on as an apprentice. After a year working with her mentor, she murdered him and appropriated his [[spellbook]]s and [[magic item]]s. From there, she headed for [[Luskan]] and made contact with the Arcane Brotherhood, eventually earning a place as one of their lesser agents in [[1362 DR]].

Since then, she applied herself to carrying out assignments with precision and alacrity, gaining a reputation that put her in good stead when the Archmage Arcane, [[Arklem Greeth]], who sought a replacement Overwizard of the North Tower in the wake of his purging of the organization in late [[1371 DR]] or early [[1372 DR]].

Valindra was tasked with directing the Arcane Brotherhood's activities in the [[Silver Marches]], which they hoped to control. She hired spies to dwell among the communities and gather information useful to destabilizing the economy of the region. She also smuggled addictive Thayan memory-loss drugs with the hopes of reducing people's ability to react as she stepped up her efforts to take over the area.

After the destruction of the Host Tower of the Arcane and her own death, Arklem Greeth transformed Valindra into a lich so they could rule Luskan together from the shadows.<ref> Their phylacteries were made from gems that were given to them by [[Jarlaxle]].

During her travels with the fanatics of [[Asmodeus]] under the command of Thay, she showed that she was fully willing and hoping to join Szass Tam's ranks. She was even responsible for forming an alliance with the [[Ashmadai]] and the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. Using a powerful [[ruby]] scepter of Asmodeus that was given to her by Szass Tam and with the prayers of the cultists, she called forth a [[pit fiend]] called [[Beealtimatuche]], who in the end was responsible for the death of [[Bruenor Battlehammer]]. She was cast under ground in her wraith form by Jarlaxle and as she did so she swore to murder Jarlaxle, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], and [[Dahlia Sin'felle]].

Valindra was somehow able to return to Thay, where she continued working for Szass Tam. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, she was sent to Neverwinter in order to advance Tam's agenda in the area and, if possible, to thwart the [[shadovar]] operations there as well. Her goals were to try to restore the [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] located in [[Neverwinter Wood]], and pave the way for an eventual take over of Neverwinter by the Thayans. Once again, she had to work with the [[Ashmadai]] to achieve her goals, but she also received help from a cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Valindra also studied the [[primordial]] sealed under [[Gauntlgrym]], [[Maegera]] the Inferno, with hopes to either harness its power or control it on behalf of Szass Tam. She was also interested in controlling the [[ghost]]s of the [[Neverwinter Nine]], although she was unable to do so using what resources she had on-hand.

At some point after [[1486 DR]], she went to [[Chult]] under the orders of Szass Tam to investigate an [[artifact]] called the [[Soulmonger]]. Her mission was to take control of the artifact or, if that proved to be impossible, to destroy it. Valindra was aware of the intervention of some [[adventurer]]s in her plans, and she may have used them to achieve her goals. When the adventurers destroyed the Soulmonger, Valindra returned to Thay.

Following her expedition to Chult, Valindra was sent to a [[Sword Mountains]] peak called the [[Dragonbone Vale]], where Thayan agents had managed to unearth the ''[[Scaleblight mythallar]]'', an ancient Netherese [[mythallar]] capable of amplifying a spell's effects. The Thayans planned to cast the Cult of the Dragon's ''[[rite of the dracolich]]'' through the mythallar, which would forcefully turn every dragon in [[Faerûn]] into a dracolich under the caster's control. This would grant Szass Tam an unstoppable army. Valindra allied herself with the Cult and promised to help them fulfill the ancient prophecy of their founder [[Sammaster]]. Together managed to exploit the [[dragonsight]] of the ancient [[bronze dragon]] [[Palhavorythin]], who was then transformed into a dracolich under the cult's control.

Their efforts were combatted by the [[Shield of the North]], an alliance between the [[Harpers]], [[Lords' Alliance]], [[Order of the Gauntlet]], and [[Emerald Enclave]]. Eventually, when Valindra started casting the rite with the cult's help, she was interrupted by [[Elminster Aumar]], Palhavorythin's partner [[Gysentraxia]], and adventurers from Neverwinter. The ensuing fight ended as Valindra quickly cast the ''rite of the dracolich'' and Elminster teleported everyone else away. The rushed manner in which Valindra cast the rite led to disruptions in the dragonsight inherent to all dragons in the Realms. This triggered a new [[Rage of Dragons]].
