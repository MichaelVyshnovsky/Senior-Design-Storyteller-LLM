        "mainbody": "'''Rathgar Malynd''' was the captain of the [[Battle Hounds]] mercenary company and the main opposition of Lord [[Hamminas Dorn]] of [[Tarmalune]] as of [[1479 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Rathgar's mercenary company provided guards for shops, homes, and warehouses as well as personal security to all paying customers. He was known for his ruthless dealings with trade rivals.\n\nRathgar publicly criticized the [[Vigilant]] order and he was not fond of Hamminas Dorn's government. For him, Hamminas was no better than a [[dragon]], and he believed that a free city should have no lord other than commerce.",
        "Relationships": "Rathgar was the onetime lover of [[Tammess Eldrake]], a member of the [[Council of Tarmalune]]. Since they parted, he tried to kill her at least three times.",
        "History": "A few years before 1479 DR, Rathgar gave [[Halagothra]] the Healer a secure house and provided for personal guards to watch for her, after agents of [[Gauwervyndhal]] tried to kidnap her. This act earned him the favor of the citizens of Tarmalune.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|55}}",
