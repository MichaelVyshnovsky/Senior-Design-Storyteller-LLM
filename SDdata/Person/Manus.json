        "mainbody": "'''Manus''' was a [[human]] [[Harper]] who followed the Harper hero [[Jaheira]] into the [[Shadow-cursed lands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Manus was a man with long brown hair who wore a set of [[leather armor]]s with his ''[[harper pin]]'' proudly displayed.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira was alerted of the mysterious return of [[Ketheric Thorm]], now a leader of a cultist army that worshiped [[The Absolute]]. Harper Manus was one of the agents who accompanied Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed lands surrounding the [[Moonrise Towers]] â€“ General Thorm's seat of power.\n\nWhen a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the [[Last Light Inn]], which Harpers claimed as a temporary base, Manus was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if Harper Manus survived the war with the Absolute. The accords of the events varied. Some claimed he might've perished after the Last Light Inn was consumed by the darkness or survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign."
