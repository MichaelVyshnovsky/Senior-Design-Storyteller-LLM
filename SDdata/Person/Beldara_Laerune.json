        "Activities": "Beldara was quite famous for her travels, like the one from [[Icewind Dale]] to [[Halruaa]] and the one from [[Nimbral]] to [[Sossal]]. She usually preferred to travel with [[elves]] or [[dwarves]] rather than with [[human]]s. She was a terrible cook but could easily read the surrounding area.",
        "History": "Beldara left her home city of [[Melvaunt]] when the [[Zhentarim]] rose to power in [[Zhentil Keep]], hoping to find less oppressive areas where she could find inspiration for her music, adventures, and treasures. Beldara found a lot of all three.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], she went missing and in [[Sembia]] some said she went inside a ''[[gate]]'' in [[Myth Drannor]]."
