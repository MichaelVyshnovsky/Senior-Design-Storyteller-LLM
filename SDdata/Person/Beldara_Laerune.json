        "mainbody": "Beldara Laerune was a wayward Harper.\nBeldara was quite famous for her travels, like the one from Icewind Dale to Halruaa and the one from Nimbral to Sossal. She usually preferred to travel with elves or dwarves rather than with humans. She was a terrible cook but could easily read the surrounding area.\nBeldara left her home city of Melvaunt when the Zhentarim rose to power in Zhentil Keep, hoping to find less oppressive areas where she could find inspiration for her music, adventures, and treasures. Beldara found a lot of all three.\nIn 1368 DR, she went missing and in Sembia some said she went inside a gate in Myth Drannor."
