'''Istor''' was a [[wolf]] kept by the [[Zhentarim]] operating within the organization's [[Zhentarim hideout (Risen Road)|hideout]] found within a massive cave found beneath the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I do not understand. But I will guard this nothing-stone.|Istor, as understood through ''[[speak with animals|magical means]]''.}}

==Activities==
Istor was set to guard an pathway in the rear of the Zhentarim hideout that led down into the depths of the [[Underdark]].Istor's keen sense of smell made suspicious of the ''[[illusory wall]]'' that obscured the entrance to this pathway, though as a wolf he did not fully comprehend the discrepancy between his senses.

==History==
The massive wolf was tasked with guard duty as the Zhentarim planned to demolish their hideout in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, to avoid detection by the [[Flaming Fist]].
