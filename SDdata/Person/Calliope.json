        "mainbody": "Calliope was an adventuring half-elf bard and an ex-pirate, active in the late 15 century DR.\nCalliope had shoulder-long red hair and a freckled face. Her one blue eye showed a mischievous personality while an eyepatch covered the left eye.\nRaised a pirate, Calliope was easy to lose composure and give in to anger and use her sharp tongue and \"colorful\" language. Even so, she had a knack for celebrating, and liked to share her joy with her friends. She was prone to sudden moments of musical inspiration.\nCalliope accumulated weapons and trinkets throughout her career, including several powerful magical items. Her weapon of choice was a rapier and sometimes she wielded a simple longsword. She owned several magical blades, such as the Eye of the Storm, the Hearts Splinter, the unique sword of riotous revels, and the mysterious Boris, the blade that had the face of her former teacher. Calliope owned a ring of battle, a pair of magical idle dice, an ioun stone of protection, and an enchanted spyglass called Squint.\nCalliopes enchanted lute was her favorite and quite weathered magical instrument, from the neck of which dangled the seal of orchestration. She also owned several other magical lutes that she switched as the need arose thw charming lute was aptly named for its ability to cast charm monster, and Basher was a deadly lute that allowed Calliope to instantly kill her opponents with one pluck of its strings.\nOn her head, Calliope wore a makeshift bandana she called Bonny, she sliced it off unsuspecting Mirts coat. The bandana turned out to be a magical item with healing properties. On her feet, she wore the Keels, boots crafted out of metal parts of the ships she downed during her pirating days. Calliope had the Keels enchanted to give her the frightful presence.\nthumb|Calliope, cheerfully playing her trusty lute in battle.\nBoris, a pirate captain who raised Calliope, was her mentor and the father figure.\nCalliope could often be found in Waterdeep accompanied by her two best friends, a human rogue Hitch and a halfling fighter Skip Brickard. The trio gained some renown and was mentioned by Volothamp Geddarm in his book Dungeonology.\nDuring her time working for the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Calliope worked alongside adventurers Coriolis, Farideh, Halbenet, Naomlen, Nayeli, Raika, Saarvin, Shevarith, and Tommus. During the same period of time, she became acquainted with the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, a drow mercenary Jarlaxle, as well as two of the Lords of Waterdeep, Durnan and Mirt the Moneylender.\nCalliope was raised in the high seas aboard a pirate ship by a privateer only known as Boris. Accustomed to the fast life of danger and swashbuckle, Calliope continued adventuring long after leaving her pirate life behind. Eventually, her fate brought her to the City of Splendors, where she engaged in missions alongside the Force Grey and on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15th century DR."
