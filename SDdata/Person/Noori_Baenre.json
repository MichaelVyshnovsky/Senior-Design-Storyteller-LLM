        "mainbody": "Noori Baenre was a female high-born cousin to Triel Baenre. She was one of the few exceptions to the rule of only males at Sorcere circa 1373 DR. She was permitted to study magic at Sorcere rather than become a cleric of Lolth at Arach-Tinilith.\nShe was one of the Baenre magic-users who Gromph Baenre gathered during the Siege of Menzoberranzan for an attack on Nimor Imphraezl through a scrying crystal."
