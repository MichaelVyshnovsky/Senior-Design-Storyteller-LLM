        "mainbody": "'''Ornar of the Claw''' was one of the Overwizards of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] in the 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], Ornar was famous for the claw-related combat [[spell]]s he created.\nHe was busy creating some new ''[[magic storm]]'' spells. He plotted to conquer [[Hellgate Keep]], [[Silverymoon]], [[Everlund]], and [[Sundabar]], using [[Uthgardt]] barbarians as fodder.",
        "History": "In [[1371 DR]], after [[Eldeluc]] and [[Valkebar]]'s coup against the Archmage Arcane, [[Arklem Greeth]], Ornar pledged his loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a [[lich]] with some new [[devil]]ish allies, Ornar escaped to a hideout in the [[Evermoors]].",
        "Personality": "Ornar was an able strategist that never forget a face. He tried to look kind in order to avoid having too many enemies."
