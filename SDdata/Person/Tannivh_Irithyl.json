He is known for having successfully routed the [[drow]] from the [[Twisted Tower]] in {{Yearlink|-331}}, passing control of the tower to followers of [[Eilistraee]]. In gratitude to the reformed and surface-acclimatized drow who helped in the downfall of the tower, he granted them rights to settle remote woods east of [[Myth Drannor | Cormanthor]]. He died in {{Yearlink|-223}}, passing the rulership of the realm to his son, [[Eltargrim Irithyl]]."
