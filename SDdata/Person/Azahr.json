        "mainbody": "'''Azahr''' was a dancer and the ringleader of a [[bard]]ic group of traveling scoundrels in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Oh, I think there are many more riches to be gained here, so that's a yes.''|Azahr}}",
        "Description": "Azahr was a [[fire genasi]] and appeared distantly touched by the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. She had dark bronze skin and brightly flicking and burning white hair. Azahr had a tight body of a professional dancer.",
        "Possessions": "Among treasures of the thieving bard, no doubt all stolen, were such items as a ''[[Mac-Fuirmidh citern]]'' and a ''[[fife of blasting]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Azahr led a traveling gang of [[rogue|roguish]] performers that included [[William (Crossroad Keep)|William]] and his [[tambourine]], [[Lila]], a [[flute|flautist]], and [[Venn]] a sting musician. Azahr and her band spent some time performing at the [[Crossroad Keep]] as it was being reinvigorated by trade and commerce after the devastation of the [[Shadow War]]. The band's leader was happy to be making [[coin]] once again and planned on staying at the keep for a little while. However, that time was cut short after Azahr sole a precious artifact â€“ ''[[Gauntlets of Ironfist]],'' from the keep's seneschal, [[Khelgar Ironfist]]. The thieving bards fled to Azahr's cabin hideout in the [[Neverwinter Wood]], guarded by the woman's [[orc]] bodyguards, led by [[Feargus Orc-Heart]]. [[Khelgar Ironfist]] sent a group of adventurers to retrieve the precious stolen magic item; a brawl was ensured as every inhabitant of the hideout stood up in their boss's defense."
