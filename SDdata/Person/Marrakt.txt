Marrakt was an orc messenger in Zhent-occupied Daggerdale in 1367 DR.
An orc without a tribe, Marrakt acted as a lackey and messenger for Constable Tren Noemfor.
In 1367 DR, Constable Tren sent Marrakt escorted by two mercenaries to invite a just-arrived-in-town adventuring party to meet him.
Marrakt did not want to be part of any fight at the first sign of trouble, he escaped.
