He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers, along the stairs towards one of the towers' entrances. The fortress was controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General [[Ketheric Thorm]]. Like many other members of the cult, Dorikel's fate remained unknown as he could've perished in battle when the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] and her [[True Soul]] allies stormed the Moonrise."
