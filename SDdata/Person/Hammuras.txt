Hammuras was a Waterdhavian spice merchant in the late 14 century DR.
As of his last meeting, he was carrying a small chest which held rubies.
In early spring of , Hammuras was in debt to Caethur at a meeting the moneylender had with him and five other debtors in a room overlooking Jembril Street. He made the payment to Caethur, but after the brass merchant Aldurl Nael did not, the moneylender murdered the non-paying debtor. Caethur had his men murder all the others anyway, as they were witnesses to the murder.
