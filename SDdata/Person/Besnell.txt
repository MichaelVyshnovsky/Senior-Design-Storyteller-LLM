'''Besnell''' was a high-ranking [[elf|elven]] [[Knights in Silver|Knight in Silver]] who hailed from [[Silverymoon]] in the [[Silver Marches]]. He led the Knights in Silver against the [[drow]] during the battle for [[Mithral Hall]].

==Description==
Like many elves, Besnell had angular features, golden hair and eyes, but was taller than most of his kind.

==Personality==
Extremely noble, Besnell was not prideful and worked to keep all the forces protecting Mithral Hall from killing each other.

==Possessions==
In battle, Besnell used a [[sword]] and wore a bright [[breastplate]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Besnell and a hundred Knights of Silver combined forces with the [[Longrider]]s of [[Longsaddle]], the [[Riders of Nesmé]], and [[Berkthgar]]'s [[barbarians]] of [[Settlestone]] to defend Mithral Hall from the drow of [[Menzoberranzan]].

During the [[Battle of Keeper's Dale]], Besnell was pierced through the lung by a [[goblin]] wielding a [[spear]]. Before he could fall to the ground, Berkthgar the Bold grabbed the fallen elf, who died in the barbarian's arms. His last words were "For the good of all goodly folk."
