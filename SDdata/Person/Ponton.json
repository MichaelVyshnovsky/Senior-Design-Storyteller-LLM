        "mainbody": "onton was a cleric of Tyr in Urml in the Shining Plains in 1358 DR.\nPonton took care of the temple of Tyr in Urml, where was kept the Hand of Tyr artifact gauntlet.\nPonton started his training in the Church of Tyr in Urml under Devron, an old cleric who had fought during the famed Battle of Urml of 1258 DR. So he became enthusiastic about the anniversary in 1358 DR, but disliked that the event had become a kind of reenactment and local festival instead of a celebration of Tyr.\nDuring the goblin attack on the reenactment, the arcanaloth Yrkhetep, posing as the White Warrior, arrived and asked for the Hand of Tyr from Ponton, who happily gave to him."
