Umbregard was a mage, once of Galadorna, in the midâ€“8 century DR.
He came to be friends with Starsunder.
He carried at least two wands for aggressive magic, some rings, and a walking staff that was old, fire-hardened, and copper-shod.
In spring of the , Umbregard went to Tangletrees, where he talked to the elven wizard Starsunder, looking for information on Elminster Aumar, the last Court Mage of the realm of Galadorna, and on how should mages conduct themselves. He was accepted as the grove found him worthy, a sign of it being the flowers and stalks that sprouted from his staff. Their conversation grew long, and was only interrupted by the elf receiving notice that flame was wielded in a distant forest, near what was the Dead Place they crossed a portal to reach it.
Across the ocean, they fought a number of Sharran Dreadspells they only prevailed because of the intrusion of his foe of many years, Tenthar Taerhamoos. Starsunder was badly injured during the fight, and in the aftermath, Tenthar helped heal him.
