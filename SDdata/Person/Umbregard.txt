'''Umbregard''' was a mage, once of [[Galadorna]], in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He came to be friends with [[Starsunder]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|743-746|20}}

==Possessions==
He carried at least two ''[[wand]]s'' for aggressive magic, some [[ring]]s, and a walking [[staff]] that was old, fire-hardened, and [[copper]]-shod.

==History==
In spring of the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Umbregard went to [[Tangletrees]], where he talked to the elven wizard Starsunder, looking for information on [[Elminster Aumar]], the last Court Mage of the realm of Galadorna, and on how should mages conduct themselves. He was accepted as the grove found him worthy, a sign of it being the flowers and stalks that sprouted from his staff.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|681-683|15}} Their conversation grew long, and was only interrupted by the elf receiving notice that flame was wielded in a distant forest, near what was [[the Dead Place]]; they crossed a portal to reach it.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|713-714|18}}

Across the ocean, they fought a number of [[Shar]]ran [[Dreadspells]]; they only prevailed because of the intrusion of his foe of many years, Tenthar Taerhamoos. Starsunder was badly injured during the fight, and in the aftermath, Tenthar helped heal him.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|750-751|20}}
