Sika al-Bana was a halfling who worked and cared for Hama Sayif within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Sika played his pipes while Hama performed his splendid dances. He also took care off all haggling for Hamas customers.
Sikas mate was Bara Minora.
Sika had been with Hama ever since he saved the lives of he and his mate in Al-Akara Mountains.
