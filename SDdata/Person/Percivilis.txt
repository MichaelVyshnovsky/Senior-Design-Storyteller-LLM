Percivilis was a paladin who had entered the [[Tomb of Martek]] in order to stop [[Khalitharius]]' rampage and became trapped in the [[Garden of the Cursed]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|110}}

==Abilities==
Of human maximum charisma, optimum intelligence for a wizard, amazing strength, and outstanding agility, Percivilis was quite gifted.

==Possessions==
Percivilis wielded a longsword and wore an enchanted set of chain mail.

==Relationships==
The Palan-teen in the [[Garden of the Cursed]] made him their leader, recognizing he was better than they were. They had several other leaders, however.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|108}}

He would not speak of [[Trifakas]] and his two thieves, having nothing nice to say of them.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|111}}

==History==
Percivilis entered the Tomb in a holy quest to save the desert an efreet. Three weeks after he entered, the adventurers who finally resurrected [[Martek]] entered the tomb. Percivilis might have attempted to meet with those adventurers; unless they seemed pure of heart (and really sorry they released [[Khalitharius]]), he may have been quite loath to act in their service, making it clear that he distrusted them even if they joined forces.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}
