Percivilis was a paladin who had entered the Tomb of Martek in order to stop Khalitharius rampage and became trapped in the Garden of the Cursed.
Of human maximum charisma, optimum intelligence for a wizard, amazing strength, and outstanding agility, Percivilis was quite gifted.
Percivilis wielded a longsword and wore an enchanted set of chain mail.
The Palan-teen in the Garden of the Cursed made him their leader, recognizing he was better than they were. They had several other leaders, however.
He would not speak of Trifakas and his two thieves, having nothing nice to say of them.
Percivilis entered the Tomb in a holy quest to save the desert an efreet. Three weeks after he entered, the adventurers who finally resurrected Martek entered the tomb. Percivilis might have attempted to meet with those adventurers unless they seemed pure of heart (and really sorry they released Khalitharius), he may have been quite loath to act in their service, making it clear that he distrusted them even if they joined forces.
