        "mainbody": "'''Althallan Crownsilver''' was a member of [[House Crownsilver]], a noble family in [[Cormyr]]. He ascended to the head of the family for a short time in the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Althallan was of small stature, but moved with feline grace. He had luxurious red hair and large dark-blue or indigo eyes that made him appear almost feminine.",
        "Personality": "His wit was as quick and sharp as his swords.",
        "Abilities": "Despite being a small man, Althallan had a great capacity for alcohol and could drink much larger men under the table. He was quite good at wielding two [[rapier]]-like [[longsword]]s simultaneously. He had no qualms about using a large drinking vessel as a missile weapon.",
        "Activities": "According to the notorious divulger of secrets, [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Althallan and his friend [[Donder Cormaeril]] concocted a scheme to put pressure on western [[Sembian]] merchants and holdings by secretly supporting the so-called [[Hullack Hawk]]—a bandit that attacked Sembian interests and fled into the [[Hullack Forest]]—and publicly directing the blame toward [[Eltrym Drauthglas]], the Lord of Hullack.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|77}}",
        "History": "Althallan once foiled an assassination attempt that happened after a bout of drinking. All the other nobles involved were intoxicated to the point of impairment, but Althallan had the wherewithal to intercept and slay the killer.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Although unproven, Volo posited that the Hullack Hawk was none other than [[Beldarm Truesilver]] in disguise, doing the bidding of, or at least in league with, Althallan and Donder."
