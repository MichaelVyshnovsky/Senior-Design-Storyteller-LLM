        "mainbody": "Althallan Crownsilver was a member of House Crownsilver, a noble family in Cormyr. He ascended to the head of the family for a short time in the early 13 century DR.\nAlthallan was of small stature, but moved with feline grace. He had luxurious red hair and large dark-blue or indigo eyes that made him appear almost feminine.\nHis wit was as quick and sharp as his swords.\nDespite being a small man, Althallan had a great capacity for alcohol and could drink much larger men under the table. He was quite good at wielding two rapier-like longswords simultaneously. He had no qualms about using a large drinking vessel as a missile weapon.\nAccording to the notorious divulger of secrets, Volothamp Geddarm, Althallan and his friend Donder Cormaeril concocted a scheme to put pressure on western Sembian merchants and holdings by secretly supporting the so-called Hullack Hawk—a bandit that attacked Sembian interests and fled into the Hullack Forest—and publicly directing the blame toward Eltrym Drauthglas, the Lord of Hullack.\nAlthallan once foiled an assassination attempt that happened after a bout of drinking. All the other nobles involved were intoxicated to the point of impairment, but Althallan had the wherewithal to intercept and slay the killer.\nAlthough unproven, Volo posited that the Hullack Hawk was none other than Beldarm Truesilver in disguise, doing the bidding of, or at least in league with, Althallan and Donder."
