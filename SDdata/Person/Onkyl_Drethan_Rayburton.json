        "mainbody": "Onkyl Drethan Rayburton was one of the founders of Cormyr and a member of the noble Rayburton family.\nOnkyl was tall and thin with soft brown eyes and hair so blond that it was almost white. He wore his hair long and kept his mustache impeccably curled. He was usually dressed in shoes with pointed toes and low heels, hose with cross-garters, a long tunic with rich embroidery and fancy sleeves, and a fashionable cloak.\nOnkyl was a scholar and did not enjoy life outside of secure shelter. He was afraid of most non-domesticated animals, orcs, elves, dragons, and generally anything that he imagined could be encountered in the Wolf Woods of early Cormyr. His idea of comfort was a sturdy castle with many armed guards. He felt isolated and sought out the company of other like-minded, civilized people.\nOnkyl had an eye for detail and a sharp memory. He was very organized and could direct others efficiently.\nOnkyl had practically nothing but the family name in common with his brother Belmer. The turmoil surrounding the Rayburton Jewels drove them from being aloof to outright fear and distrust.\nOnkyl had a son named Telarn that he was proud of and came to rely on in his later years.\nWhen Belmer Rayburton came to blows with warlords Relve Turcassan and Orndar Merendil over a dispute about funding the military effort to protect and stabilize nascent Cormyr, Onkyl managed to quell his brothers burning desire to finish the fight by threatening to reveal Belmers secret. According to famed explorer and investigator, Volothamp Geddarm, the only secret that could have reined in Belmers bloodlust was the existence of the Rayburton Jewels. It was revealed in a letter to his son Telarn, found after his death, that Onkyl had briefly seen inside the two chests of jewels and encouraged Telarn to claim them for himself."
