Captain Durham Shaw was a leader among the Neverwinter Guard in the late 15 century DR.
Durham visibly suffered from effects of the Spellplague.
Captain Shaw worked for Lord Dagult Neverember and served under General Sabine. Many of his subordinates in the Neverwinter Guard did not respect him.
Durham was Captain of the Wall as of the . By and large, the local Neverwintian soldiers who had long manned the Wall despised him and resented taking orders from him. Beyond their normal distaste for New Neverwinter mercenaries, the soldiers believed he was receiving preferential treatment by being allowed to remain in the city despite Neverembers standing edict that all individuals affected by the Spellplague be expelled from Neverwinter.
It was believed that Durham and Lord Dagult Neverember were either personal friends or at least distantly related.
