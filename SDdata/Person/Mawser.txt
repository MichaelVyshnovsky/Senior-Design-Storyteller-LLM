'''Mawser''' was a [[Tymora]]-worshiping man from the [[Dalelands]] that fought in the famous [[second battle of Shadowdale]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a thin man that held the devout belief that the Goddess of Luck watched over his safety.

==History==
During the [[Zhentilar]] invasion [[Shadowdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Mawser volunteered to set off a falling-tree trap that would take out many Zhent soldiers and block the incoming road from [[Voonlar]]. 

Unfortunately Mawser's luck soon ran out, as he was shot through the neck by a Zhentish arrow.
