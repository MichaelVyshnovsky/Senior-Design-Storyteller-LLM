'''Rectus''' was a [[ghoul]] servant of [[Mystic Carrion]], a [[mummy lord]] who resided in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Rectus was slain and risen as an [[undead]] servant sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Mystic Carrion, who performed dark magic serviced for the wealthy clients from the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]], kept Rectus and other undead as his minions in Philgrave's Mansion in the Lower City. The manse was a mysterious and suspicious landmark that attracted attention due to the putrid stench of the dead that emanated from the building.
