        "mainbody": "adventurer\nArvyn Umbryl was the proprietor of the Smiling Satyr tavern outside Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nCirca the 1370s DR, Arvyn Umbryl appeared to be a strong and muscular man of average height who was starting to grow a belly. His shoulder-length hair was starting to grey and his face was always clean-shaven. He had icy blue eyes and hooked nose. Diagonally across Arvyns left forearm stretched a scar from his old adventuring days.\nArvyns usual garb included thick heavy boots, leather beeches, and open pirates shirt. When he was at the Smiling Satyr, Arvyn wore a leather apron. He hid a knife and a dagger tucked away in each of his boots.\nHe was a warm and pleasant man who spoke in gravelly voice.\nArvyn owned the Smiling Satyr tavern, the hill it stood on, and the two fields on either side, which he allowed to be used as campsites. Among the antique weapons, broken shields, skulls of monsters, and other trophies of adventures past on the walls, behind the bar were two crossed magic battleaxes of dancing. Arvyn, and only Arvyn, could command these to animate to defend himself and his staff.\nArvyn was a retired adventurer, but his accomplishments, if any, were unknown to the likes of Volo. Regardless, he was running the Smiling Satyr by 1365 DR and through 1370 DR, alongside his quiet wife Marra Umbryl who ran the establishments kitchen. Their three daughters Dauntra, Shammarra, and impish Lantrue ran business errands, tended to guests horses, and helped with the business.\nHe had a descendant in the person of Gharwin Umbryl, who ran the Smiling Satyr in the late 1480s DR."
