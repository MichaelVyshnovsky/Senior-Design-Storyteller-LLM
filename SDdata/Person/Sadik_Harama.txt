Sadik Harama was an old dwarf who ran a small shop within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Sadik was completely bald.
Sadik sold a wide variety of metal weapons in the Grand Bazaar. The quality of his weapons was average or good, but he was a poor haggler, so clever customers usually found great deals.
Sadik employed a pair of hulking ogres armed with two-handed swords.
