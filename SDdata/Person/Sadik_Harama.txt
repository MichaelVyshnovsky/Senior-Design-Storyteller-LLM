'''Sadik Harama''' was an old [[dwarf]] who ran a small shop within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Sadik was completely bald.

==Activities==
Sadik sold a wide variety of metal weapons in the Grand Bazaar. The quality of his weapons was average or good, but he was a poor haggler, so clever customers usually found great deals.

Sadik employed a pair of hulking [[ogre]]s armed with [[two-handed sword]]s.
