YuYa Mao was a cat hengeyokai adventurer in Shou Lung in the midâ€“14 century DR.
YuYa Mao wandered the land, protecting a great number of small villages from any danger. She preferred put a stop to trouble swiftly and move on, so the folk she aided knew little about her.
YuYa Mao was a swift but elegant individual, in any form. In human form, she carried a longsword and a short sword.
She was curious but oddly aloof. When among humans for extended periods, she preferred to remain in the form of a stray Siamese cat playing pranks and pinching fish.
Around 1357 DR, YuYa was sometimes a companion of the tiger hengeyokai Hu.
