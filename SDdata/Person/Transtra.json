        "Relationship": "Transtra's only companion was her pet [[behir]] [[Uliss]], that she had come across in Undermountain and charmed to obey her.\n\nShe was also a business associate of, and informant for, [[Mirt]] the Moneylender.",

She also owned at least one warehouse, and had business dealings in smuggling, gambling, thievery, slavery, and moneylending. She was also known to hire adventurers to investigate rumors in [[Undermountain]].",
