        "mainbody": "'''Yorven Springpaw''' was a [[harengon]] [[barbarian]] and [[druid]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|I am vengeance incarnate, born of treachery and the shadows. I wield the powers of the Shadowfell and the viciousness of nature to defend those who cannot defend themselves. It is very hurtful that you assume that makes me a bad person.|Yorven Springpaw}}",
        "Description": "Yorven's black fur was marked with [[magic]]al ''[[eldritch claw]]'' and ''[[blood fury]]'' [[tattoo]]s. He dressed in a simple, open-chested [[jerkin]]&mdash;that he had made himself from trophies from fallen enemies&mdash;and a [[kilt]]. His ears were pierced and torn, and both his fangs were broken.",
        "Personality": "When Yorven was lost in the [[Shadowfell]], he was forced to embrace his inner beast spirit or die. Not only did he survive; he thrived.",
        "Abilities": "His signature move was savagely mauling his opponents with his sharp claws. Yorven could ''[[wild shape]]'' into a [[shadow mastiff]]-like creature. He had an innate sense of impending danger that gave him an edge in combat.",
        "Possessions": "Yorven kept a pair of [[scissors]] for use as a weapon in a pinch. He owned several trophies taken from defeated [[shadow dragon]]s.",
        "History": "As a child, Yorven was lured away from his childhood home in the [[Feywild]] by a coven of [[hag]]s. He became lost in the Shadowfell but found a way to survive and build his strength. When he chanced an encounter with the [[cosmology|planes]]-traveling [[Witchlight Carnival]], Yorven signed on. He stayed with the carnival for several years until he returned to the Feywild to seek revenge on the hags who had wronged him."
