        "mainbody": "Yorven Springpaw was a harengon barbarian and druid circa the late 15 century DR.\nYorvens black fur was marked with magical eldritch claw and blood fury tattoos. He dressed in a simple, open-chested jerkin&mdashthat he had made himself from trophies from fallen enemies&mdashand a kilt. His ears were pierced and torn, and both his fangs were broken.\nWhen Yorven was lost in the Shadowfell, he was forced to embrace his inner beast spirit or die. Not only did he survive he thrived.\nHis signature move was savagely mauling his opponents with his sharp claws. Yorven could wild shape into a shadow mastiff-like creature. He had an innate sense of impending danger that gave him an edge in combat.\nYorven kept a pair of scissors for use as a weapon in a pinch. He owned several trophies taken from defeated shadow dragons. \nAs a child, Yorven was lured away from his childhood home in the Feywild by a coven of hags. He became lost in the Shadowfell but found a way to survive and build his strength. When he chanced an encounter with the planes-traveling Witchlight Carnival, Yorven signed on. He stayed with the carnival for several years until he returned to the Feywild to seek revenge on the hags who had wronged him."
