        "mainbody": "'''Ebony''' was black [[mare]] that was kept in the [[Backlands]] region of the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Ebony and five other horses, [[Bandy]], [[Cardinal (horse)|Cardinal]], [[Fowler (horse)|Fowler]], [[Hopper]], and [[Star (horse)|Star]] were kept together by a traveling company that comprised the [[mage]] [[Druhallen]], the guardswoman [[Rozt'a]], and her foster son [[Tiep]].\n\nEbony almost fell one of the peaks' sheer sides as they traversed the treacherous pathways cut along its façade. Tumbling rocks startled the mare, but her reins were collected by Tiep and her nerves were soothed by the young man. Ebony returned the favor by giving Tiep a ride later on when he was very unwell. \n\nShe was one of the horses that survived the group's journey through the mountains, and accompanied its human members into the [[Weathercote Wood]]."
