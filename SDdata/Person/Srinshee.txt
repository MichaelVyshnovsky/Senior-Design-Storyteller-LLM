'''The Srinshee''' (born '''Oluevaera Estelda''') was one of the most famous [[baelnorn]]{{Fact}} of all time. She aided three [[Cormanthyr]]an [[Coronal]]s: [[Miirphys Irithyl|Miirphys]], [[Tannivh Irithyl|Tannivh]], and [[Eltargrim]]. She also helped raise the ''[[Mythal]]'' over the elven city of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[261 DR]].{{Fact}}

==History==
[[File:Srinshee pre-regen.png|thumb|''Srinshee, before her rejuvenation.''|380x380px]]
The Srinshee played a vital role in the creation of the ''Mythal'' of Myth Drannor in 261 DR amid the ruins of the shattered court of the Coronal after she ended the madness of the [[Starym]]-led attack (which was an attempt to hinder the plans of Coronal Eltargrim). She led Mythanthor, Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, Lady [[Ahrendue Echorn]], Lord [[Earynspieir Ongluth]], and another ten mages to create the magical ward.{{cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|53, 143-144}}

The year [[661 DR]] marked the death of Coronal Eltargrim. He left only one heir behind, [[Aravae Irithyl]], who also passed in [[664 DR]], leaving a ruling vacuum behind her. In [[666 DR]] there was an unrest amongst the Noble Houses to determine the next Coronal of Myth Drannor and Cormanthyr. After forty [[elves]] and the Rule Tower itself were destroyed, the Srinshee stepped in, easily swinging the [[elfblade]] free of its perch.{{Fact}}

{{Quote|''Peoples, attend me. Look ye upon your works and deign to despair. A great gift was given to ye, and it lies ashambles. A gift given freely is to be treasured, but one scorned and abused is a gift undeserved. Two score have lit the heavens and scored the Weave in their arrogance. Two score have tried to uphold peace and unity but were found wanting of peace and unity in their own hearts. The spurned gift might have allowed one to rise above to truly become Coronal and rule well. Instead, the Coronal's Rule lies ruined under my feet. In time, ye shall understand what has been lost. In time, ye shall either forget or learn a lesson of it. I reach for the responsibility, for my slight shoulders can more bear its weight. Carry not I the onus of yore. Should I prove less than worthy, the Claiming shall continue. The gift and ye earn their own fates thereafter. Should I prove worthy, I would make ye so. Should I prove worthy, I shall give ye hope.''|''The Srinshee prophesying to all Cormanthyr.''<ref name=tFoMD-p6>}}

As it was brandished before her, the golden light of the blade crystallized around her and a quartet of High Mages in a massive diamond-shaped energy field that engulfed and restored the Rule Tower. The Srinsshee said her last teachings to all the inhabitants of Cormannthyr about brothership and hope:<ref name=tFoMD-p6 />

{{Quote|''I have proven worthy, but... Coronal I will not be. I shall not rule from the Throne but from the Heart. Look not for me to rule the realm, people, or Court. Look for me to rule war and hate with peace and love. When the dream truly becomes your own, I shall return. When elf and N'Tel'Quess alike truly accept the gift, I shall return. When Oacenth's Vow is fulfilled in the stars above and below, I shall return. When I am wanted truly, I shall return. When I am needed truly, I shall return. Peoples, attend me. Look ye upon my work and dare to hope.''|''The Srinshee prophesying to all Cormanthyr.''<ref name=tFoMD-p6 />}}

Finally, with a whirl of magic, the golden diamond magical field, the Srinshee herself, the four High Mages, and the [[Rulers' Blade]], Ar'Cor'Kerym disappeared.

The Srinshee retreated to a hidden resting place whose location was known only by [[Alvaerele Tasundrym]] and was not seen again until [[1377 DR]]. It was then that she returned to a rejuvenated Myth Drannor and offered [[Ilsevele Miritar]] the Ruler's Blade. 711 years after she disappeared, waiting for a coronal to rule her realm, a worthy one appears.

In [[1487 DR]], she fought to defend Myth Drannor from the besieging forces of [[Thultanthar]] and sacrificed herself to stop [[Larloch]] from becoming the new deity of magic.
