Scrivenscry was a conceited arcanaloth who traveled the planes in order to locate the Books of Keeping.
Scrivenscry referred to itself in third-person, and enjoyed licorice. The arcanaloth was ferocious and heinous, especially to those in service to it.
It had in its servitude a nervous, albino, blind, awakened giant penguin called Kingsport.
The arcanaloth owned a chime of opening, and three spell scrolls.
In the 15 century DR, the fiend made its way to the Prime Material Plane. It sought out four tomes containing the true names of every yugoloth in existence.
