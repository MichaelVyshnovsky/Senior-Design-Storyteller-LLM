        "mainbody": "'''Saed''' was a [[vampire]] and the preeminent beast chieftain of [[Veldorn]] throughout the 11{{th}}{{Cite dragon/236/Children of the Night}}",
        "Personality": "Saed was a melancholy character, always thinking about his lost wealth. He found peace only when he used his powers to mediate the beast chieftains' disputes.",
        "Activities": "Sometimes Saed thieved off the [[Shining South]] caravans that traveled Veldorn. He normally mediated all disputes between his fellow beast chieftains, thanks to his abilities and his [[psionics|psionic power]]s.",
        "History": "Once Saed was a member of [[Chakka Baroda]] and the wealthiest merchant of [[Turelve]] as of the early 11{{th}} century DR. Thus, as a [[Durpar]]i custom, he was also elected [[nawab]]. Saed became more and more powerful but did not want to share his wealth with his [[chaka]] fellows. So he discreetly started searching for a way to achieve immortality by means of ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.\n\nOne day in the {{YearlinkName|1048}}, a very friendly visitor arrived in his court, offering immortality in exchange for an oath to [[Shar]]. Saed agreed and the visitor brought him to the ruins of [[Old Vaelen]]; where he turned Saed into a [[vampire]] slave. He went back to his city as a puppet of his master. When his chaka discovered the matter, they sent adventurers to kill the vampires but slew only Saed's master. Saed survived and escaped. Afterward, Chakka Baroda put out a story about his disappearance and continued to rule.\n\nSaed went back to Old Vaelen and settled there. In time, the surrounding beast chieftains started to appreciate his diplomatic skills and soon Saed became the arbiter of all disputes in Veldorn. He also convinced the other beast chieftains to make a mutual alliance to destroy outside invasions.\n\nWhen the [[Datharathi]] chaka rose to power in the 15{{th}} century, Saed manipulated their hired adventuring bands to make forays into the [[Beastlands]] and remove any potential rivals for his power."
