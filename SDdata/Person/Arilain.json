In , the talented archwizard discovered that the great Karsus was developing a new extremely powerful spell. The spellcasters of Opus managed to divine the effects of this spell, which would become known as Karsuss avatar. Arilain warned the other arcanists of Opus, but personally set out to approach Karsus himself. However, after meeting with Karsus, she was never heard of again."
