Bramas Thorntree was a thief and smuggler in Tethyr in 1370 DR.
Bramas worked for Kiros Tamadan, a spice merchant in Athkatla, who through various agents and blind contacts worked for Inselm Hhune.
Bramas had  worked for his boss for a long time.
In 1370 DR DR, Bramas was ordered to to gather a mercenary company and recover the Sondarr Scepter from a long-forgotten dwarven tomb in the Starspire Mountains. He gathered some old allies and mercenaries, forming the Company of the Anvil. Together they recovered the Scepter.
They were ordered to maintain a low profile in their return voyage and on Uktar 10 they stopped at the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth for a drink.
Later that night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter. However, the dwarves accidentally started a brawl with the Shields of the Highland adventuring company. Bramas and his companions used this as an opportunity to escape with the Scepter.
Bramas took his work very seriously. He was totally loyal to his masters and always honored a contract. However, he would not follow this duty to the death. Instead, if surrounded by enemies, he falsely surrendered and cooperated with the hope of escaping later. Bramas also enjoyed taunting his vanquished adversaries after the end of a job.
