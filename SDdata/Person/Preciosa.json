She attended the \"Laff Riot\" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by Harvard Willoughby in Elfsongs side room with a stage. Preciosa, a well-dressed woman herself, thought Willoughby to be a snappy dresser apart from the mans monocle. She hoped the word around town about the comedian was true and he was funny enough to distract her from the looming threat of the Cult of the Absolute."
