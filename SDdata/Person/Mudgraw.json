        "mainbody": "Mudgraw was a tortle druid and guide who lived in Ahoyhoy in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had led expeditions to Shilku and the Heart of Ubtao. Two years later, he led an expedition to Omu. This was three years before the death curse.\nMudgraw had only one visit to Omu. He accompanied a group of treasure hunters from the city of Athkatla. They were ambushed by yuan-ti and Mudgraw was forced to abandon the treasure hunters. He hid in the ruins of a shrine to the god Ubtao. In the shrine, he found a holy symbol of Ubtao and since then wore it around his neck believing that Ubtao had assisted him in escaping the city."
