'''Obslin Minstrelwish''' was Seneschal of [[Twilight Hall]] in [[Berdusk]] and one of the [[High Harpers]].

==History==
In [[Tarsakh]] of [[1370 DR]], he was running the Harper stronghold during the absence of the severely ill [[Cylyria Dragonbreast]] when, under the urging of [[Bran Skorlsun]], Obslin agreed to discuss the evidence that showed [[Khelben Arunsun]] was a traitor. The Harpers had discovered that Khelben had been the one who had stolen the ''[[Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings]]'', a powerful [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[artefact]] thirteen years before from the [[Catacombs of Ordulin]]. This artifact had since ended up in the hands of the [[Zhentarim]].
