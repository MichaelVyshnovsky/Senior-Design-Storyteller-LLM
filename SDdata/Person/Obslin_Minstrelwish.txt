Obslin Minstrelwish was Seneschal of Twilight Hall in Berdusk and one of the High Harpers.
In Tarsakh of 1370 DR, he was running the Harper stronghold during the absence of the severely ill Cylyria Dragonbreast when, under the urging of Bran Skorlsun, Obslin agreed to discuss the evidence that showed Khelben Arunsun was a traitor. The Harpers had discovered that Khelben had been the one who had stolen the Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings, a powerful Netherese artefact thirteen years before from the Catacombs of Ordulin. This artifact had since ended up in the hands of the Zhentarim.
