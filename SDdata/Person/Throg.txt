'''Throg the Ravenous''' was an [[orc]] warrior of the [[Many-Arrows]] kingdom and one of the lieutenants of [[Vansi Bloodscar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
The mighty orc fought in a manner that was quite similar to the [[ogre]]s that fought in the Many-Arrows forces.

==Possessions==
Befitting his combat style, Throg favored a [[magic]]al club of the variety often wielded by ogres. In battle, he wore a suit of [[leather armor]] that was unique to the orcs of the Many-Arrows kingdom.

==History==
During the Many-Arrows orcs' occupation of the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] of [[Neverwinter]], Throg could be found in the [[Cloak Tower]], along with Vansi Bloodscar and her other lieutenants. When [[adventurer]]s in service to Captain [[Janros]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] finally penetrated the tower in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, they confronted and slew Throg the Ravenous in the Botanical Garden.
