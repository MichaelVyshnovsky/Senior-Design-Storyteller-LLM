'''Ulcaster''' was a [[conjurer]] of note, who founded a school of wizardry, the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]], in the small farming village of [[Beregost]] in the midâ€“11th century [[DR]].

Roughly eighty years after the school was founded, [[Calishite]] mages came to fear the school's power and popularity. During the {{yearlinkName|1106}}, the school was destroyed in a massive spell battle. Ulcaster disappeared during the confusion and was not seen since.

The ruins of the school lay on a hill to the east of Beregost and were said to be haunted. The local [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]] grazed their sheep near the ruins to keep an eye on things in the area.

[[Gorion's Ward]] eventually met Ulcaster's ghost haunting his school.<ref>
