        "Description": "This wizard and alchemist had a young, plump-looking face, and had a bald head. He also had thick mutton chops. Avery was a member of the [[Council's Eminent Fellowship of Healers]],\n\nCustomers would often call Avery by the namesake of his shop, Felogyr. However, Avery did not mind, and did not even correct them.",
        "Personality": "Sonshal abhorred non-magical members of the Council's Eminent Fellowship of Healers, for instance, surgeons and botanists.",
        "Relationships": "Avery was the descendent of [[Felogyr Sonshal]], who was the namesake of [[Felogyr's Fireworks]]. He had a working relationship with the [[Church of Gond]] of Baldur's Gate, as well as the [[Council of Four]]. He would sell them [[smokepowder]] to fulfil their inventive needs, though he sold [[firework]]s to other customers.",
        "Activities": "Avery Sonshal was the author of the illustrated guide called ''[[Boom, Bang, Blast: The Joy of Fireworks]]''.",
        "History": "In [[1482 DR]], Avery was the proprietor of Felogyr's Fireworks. Around this time, the disguised [[Imbralym Skoond]] came to his shop, ordered a large amount of fireworks, and bought everything he had in his store. Skoond, however, did not reveal his identity, and used the alias \"Horus Kope\". The disguised mage also paid for the names of those who would supply Avery with his raw materials.\n\nSometime in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Avery Sonshal was infected with an [[illithid]] tadpole of the [[Absolute]], indoctrinating him into the servitude to the cult and making him a [[True Soul]]. Whilst serving the looming anger of the cult, Avery supplied the new Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[church of Bane|cultists of Bane]] with smokepowder and explosives. Avery's explosives were used to arm the sunken [[Iron Throne headquarters]] to detonate in case of emergency, and the Banites were supplied the explosives to be used against the refugees that began flooding the city, fleeing the armies of the Absolute."
