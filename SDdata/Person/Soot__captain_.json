He was famous and welcomed at hundreds of ports.\nCaptain Soot had jet-black skin and curly white hair. He had a small well-trimmed white beard and mustache.\nSoot loved to travel, to visit and see new locales, and to meet new people and particularly new women.\nCaptain Soot used his ship, the Ebony Queen, to travel between between Qudra and the Pearl Cities in Zakhara, lands outside Zakhara, and the genie realms on the elemental planes, He was able to trade with genies since they considered him to be an honorary genie, and they dealt with him without loss of face. Soot also traded with the mamluks of Qudra. Soot would transport passengers and goods for a hefty fee.\nWhen in the City of Brass, Soot enjoyed polymorphing into the shape of an efreet and posing as a merchant under an assumed name. He used the spells reduce and vanish to make any cargo he purchased disappear into the Ebony Queens hold.\nSoot was skilled in navigation and sailing, trade, and spellcraft knowledgeable in astrology and the lore of genie-kind, skilled in trade and adept in poetry.\nIn addition to the Ebony Queen, Soot owned a number of other magical items. He wore  a jellaba of eyes, a ring of protection +2, and a ring of spell storing. This was a ring finely carved from jasper and held fire shield, monster summoning II, contact other plane, and vanish. He also had a brass elephant.\nThe spells at his command were change self, chill touch, enlarge, magic missile, shield alter self, deeppockets, invisibility, reduce, stinking cloud blink, haste, lightning bolt, non-detection, wraithform ice storm, polymorph other, shout, stoneskin and advanced illusion, cone of cold, hold monster, passwall chain lightning, and true seeing.\nWhile piloting the Ebony Queen, Soot made a show of using a tome of esoteric lore named the Book of Fixed Stars. However, it was the ships own orrery of the planes that took it between the planes.\nSoot hailed from somewhere outside Zakhara.As an ajami mage, Soot would likely to be a foreigner or outlander to Zakhara. The connection of the Ebony Queens amazons to the Anaconda Company, which was connected to Katashaka, would suggest Soot also hails from Katashaka.\nIn 1367 DR, Captain Soot and the Ebony Queen had to beat a quick departure from the City of Brass."
