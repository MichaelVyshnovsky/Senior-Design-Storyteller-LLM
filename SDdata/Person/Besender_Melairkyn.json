        "mainbody": "Besender Melairkyn was a possessing Clan Melairkyn dwarf ghost in Undermountain in 1375 DR.\nAround 1363 DR, a deepspawn, Xovliax, claimed a section of the Melairbode as its lair so Besender soon possessed it. Somehow the possession became permanent and the personalities of the dwarf and of the deepspawn fused together.\nSo Xovliax started spawning dwarves in order to form a new dwarven community inside the dungeon, Murkstone. However, the spawned dwarves were a failure and often Xovliax sent them on suicide missions. Meanwhile, however, many dwarf outcasts and some duergar joined Murkstone.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryDwarven defenders\nCategoryGhosts\nCategoryDwarves\nCategoryChieftains\nCategoryMelairkyn\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nte1p6ol6oic04od0pgtgapp5djxtm3a"
