        "mainbody": "Relarn Dayspring was a Morninglord of Lathander and the Chief Prelate of the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff during the late 14 century DR. He was popular among the heads of the civic churches, having earned the admiration of the more benevolent faiths and the grudging respect of the more malevolent ones.\nChief Prelate Relarn recognized the Circle had to maintain a strong influence over the government of Ravens Bluff, especially in the face of external religious threats. While he saw expansion of the civic religion as a likely necessity, he felt the pressure to do so could not be allowed to compromise the strong alliances between the government bodies within the city.\nRelarn had average-looking features, highlighted by thinning brown hair and large brown eyes. His thin and delicate arms and hands were well-hidden in his simple clerics robes, his attire reflected his simple taste and preference for simplicity over ornate decorations and ceremony.\nThe priest of Lathander was a kind and caring man who kept a level head and clear mind in even the must tumultuous of circumstances. He was an exceptional astute judge of character, often able to discern when someone was telling the truth.\nWhile he lacked the same authority as his predecessor, Holy Justice Sinus Melandor, Chief Prelate Relarn was respected and well-liked at the time of his ascension as head of the Clerical Circle. One of his first innovative acts was to invite representatives from the Council of Lords and the Merchants Council to attend circle meetings as observers.\nSoon into his term, Relarn discovered the vast library of esoteric religious works assembled by Chief Prelate Melandor and became fascinated by the ritualistic details, overarching goals and historical deeds of the various faiths of Faer√ªn. Maintaining this all-encompassing, empathetic mindset granted him significant wisdom when coming to decisions about individual faiths."
