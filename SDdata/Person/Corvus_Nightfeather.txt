Corvus Nightfeather was a kenku assassin and spy and the owner of Nightfeathers Circus of Wonders of the late 15 century DR.
Corvus was trained at the Rookery of Tears. He ran the Circus of Wonders, a circus traveling through southern Faerûn for a number of years.
In 1479 DR, he led the rescue of Marod el Arhapans heir, Cephas, from enslavement on the Island of the Free. He took Cephas to Almraiven, where one of his employers, Acham el Jhotos, intended to enspell Cephas with deadly magic to kill Marod. When two members of the circus were abducted and taken to Calimport, Corvus traveled with Cephas and other friends to attempt a rescue. Corvus was imprisoned by his other employer Shahrokh and stripped of all his magical items. Corvus escaped Calimport when Cephas destroyed Marods palace and gladiatorial arena.
In addition to his circus, Corvus earned his coin by acting as a spy for various factions in southern Faerûn.
Corvus had black feathers.
He seemed to have a soft spot for outcasts such as the goliath Tobin.
Corvus could shadowstep and mimic the voices and hand writing of other people.
Corvuss most powerful magical item was an extradimensional space he accessed through his chest feathers.  He possessed one of the two books necessary to complete the Ritual of Return to free Calim and Memnon from their imprisonment.
