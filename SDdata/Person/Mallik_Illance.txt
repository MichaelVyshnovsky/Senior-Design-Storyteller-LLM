Captain '''Mallik Illance''' was a shipowner and nobleman of the [[Illance]] family of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was based at the [[Cormyrean Embassy]] in [[Calimport]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Relations==
He was seventh in line for the clan's lordship and an elder cousin of [[Jhartos Illance]], who was third in line.

==Activities==
Mallik was one of the clan's few ship owners. Owing to this fact and his responsility to the family, he was forced to bring Jhartos to the Cormyrean Embassy, but hated the city and remained only because it was his duty. He established trade ties with honest merchants whose goods could be sold in Cormyr.
