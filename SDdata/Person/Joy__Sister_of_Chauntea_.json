        "History": "Following the [[Orcfastings War]], Joy left the [[Abbey of Chauntea]] to go south and provide aid to the people of [[Nimoar's Hold]]. There she worked inside a stone structure that had been converted to an infirmary and long-term care facility for the Hold's veterans. With the aid of her other sisters, she modified the magic wards around the building to amplify healing [[spell]]s and sustain those close to death.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|940}}, [[Gharl|Warlord Gharl]] set fire to the fields of Nimoar's Hold in an effort to halt the advance of [[troll]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Hero of the Troll Wars|4}} With ten of her infirmary's occupants being crippled or injured and twenty of them unconicous, they were unable to be evacuated up to [[Mount Waterdeep]]. She was unconcerned for her own safety, being determined to guard the people in her care, but she was extremely anxious about her Sisters back at the abbey.\n\nWhen a group of time-displaced [[adventurer]]s from the 15{{th}} century DR came to Nimoar's Hold during the fire, she begged them to go and provide aid to her sisters back at the Abbey of Chauntea."
