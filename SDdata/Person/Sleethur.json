        "mainbody": "Sleethur was a dark naga who laired under Myth Drannor in deep Elven Catacombs circa 1369 DR.\nSleethur was an evil and conniving creature that preyed on the unwitting passersby.\nSleethur was a highly capable spellcaster who was proficient in using the offensive magics, natural dark naga abilities, and the powers of the enchanted set of armor in their possession, Nezrass mysterious chainmail.\nIn 1369 DR, Sleethur made their way into the deep levels of the Elven Catacombs, the areas controlled by the recently arrived drow of the House Freth. From there, the dark naga started preying one the creatures that resided or passed by the territory, that included the drow, Cult of the Dragon members, orcs, and other humanoids. Sleethurs strategy was to lure the creatures into a false sense of security, addressing them, and having friendly interactions. Once the unwitting prey relaxed, the naga used the mysterious chainmail to blink at a safe distance, and shower them with offensive magic, like fireballs. Sleethur attacked the wrong prey in 1369 DR, the heroes from Phlan sent by Elminster Aumar to stop the Cults activities in the ruins. Even though ambushed, the heroes persevered and killed the treacherous creature."
