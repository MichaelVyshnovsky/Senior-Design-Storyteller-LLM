        "mainbody": "Sky Father was the posthumous title of the founder and first abbot of Stung Monastery in Bashan Do Province, Tu Lung, in the 4 century before Dalereckoning.\nHe was a shukenja who became a monk.\nIn , the abbot ordered his monks to create five high-quality placards, and they did so, creating the paper and ink from scratch, blessing the materials, and cutting the paper using a holy blade kept in the monastery. Once complete, the abbot carried the blank cards and the ink into the wilderness on a four-month long retreat of self-purging. When he returned, he had painted powerful holy symbols upon them, creating the enchanted cards called the Edusascar.\nA keen student of astronomy, he left behind countless star charts and observations of meteors and comets. Hence, after his death, he was given the title \"Sky Father\"."
