        "mainbody": "'''Sky Father''' was the posthumous title of the founder and first abbot of [[S'tung Monastery]] in [[Bashan Do Province]], [[T'u Lung]], in the 4{{th}} century before [[Dalereckoning]].",
        "History": "He was a [[shukenja]] who became a [[monk]].\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|894|SY}}, the abbot ordered his monks to create five high-quality placards, and they did so, creating the [[paper]] and [[ink]] from scratch, blessing the materials, and cutting the paper using a holy blade kept in the monastery. Once complete, the abbot carried the blank cards and the ink into the wilderness on a four-month long retreat of self-purging. When he returned, he had painted powerful holy symbols upon them, creating the enchanted cards called the [[Edu'sascar]].\n\nA keen student of [[astronomy]], he left behind countless star charts and observations of meteors and comets. Hence, after his death, he was given the title \"Sky Father\"."
