Toke Horgath was an Uthgardt human of the Elk tribe of the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier in the late 14 century DR.
In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors sometime around 1400 DR,The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of Honor Among Thieves, which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The , is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the Cult of the Dragon for control of the helmet of disjunction. Although the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, they had the black dragon Rakor on their side and vomiting acid on the barbarians ranks. The Elk chief, Stanhard Grimwulf, gave the helmet to Toke to carry to safety, but Toke was abruptly chopped in half, sideways, by a Dragon Cultist, and died. The fallen Elk tribesmen were interred at a sacred burial ground on the site.
A century later, in the late 1490s DR, the body of Toke Horgath was exhumed by Edgin Darvis, Simon Aumar, Doric, and Holga Kilgore (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simons deathly token to speak with the dead, they questioned Tokes corpse over the fate of the helmet of disjunction, and then about assorted other things to finish the spell.
