'''Toke Horgath''' was an [[Uthgardt]] [[human]] of the [[Elk tribe]] of the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==History==
In the conflict known as the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] sometime around [[1400 DR]],<ref group="note">The battle is undated but is "a century ago" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The {{yearlinkName|1402}}, is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the [[Cult of the Dragon]] for control of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]''. Although the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, they had the [[black dragon]] [[Rakor]] on their side and vomiting [[acid]] on the barbarians' ranks. The Elk chief, [[Stanhard Grimwulf]], gave the helmet to Toke to carry to safety, but Toke was abruptly chopped in half, sideways, by a Dragon Cultist, and died. The fallen Elk tribesmen were interred at a [[Evermoors cemetery|sacred burial ground on the site]].

A century later, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the body of Toke Horgath was exhumed by [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Simon Aumar]], [[Doric]], and [[Holga Kilgore]] (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's ''[[deathly token]]'' to [[speak with dead|speak with the dead]], they questioned Toke's corpse over the fate of the ''helmet of disjunction'', and then about assorted other things to finish the spell.

==Personality==
His favorite food was [[barley]], after considering [[oat]]s. He did not really like [[cat]]s. Finally, he was not good at [[mathematics]], struggling even to answer 2 + 2, but might be excused on account of being a corpse.{{Speculation}}
