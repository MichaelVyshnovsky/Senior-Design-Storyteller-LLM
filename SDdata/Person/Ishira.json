        "mainbody": "Human\nIshira was a human girl of Thay in the late 14 century DR.\nAs Xenk Yendar would recall, in the mid-1370s DR, Szass Tam, the Zulkir of Necromancy of Thay, called all the other zulkirs and all the people of Thaymount, including Ishira and Xenk, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on the eve of the summer solstice. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.Honor Among Thieves mentions only the eve of the solstice due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god Amaunator has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lieâ€”instead, Szass demanded all Thayans abandon their mortality and serve him in undeath. Then Szass used the horn of beckoning death that consumed their souls, thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain. Ishira was left standing alone and lost in the panic, and Xenk remembering see before she was lost in the killing smoke, likely to be killed and turned into a zombie.It is difficult to reconcile Xenks account and the scenes in Honor Among Thieves with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tams betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in The Crimson Gold in 1373 DR the meeting of the Council of Zulkirs in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tams takeover of Thay in Unclean in 1375 DR and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenks childhood memories, its presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization."
