'''Retta Starling''' was a female [[human]] of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==Activities==
She attended the Tourney of Talent during the [[High Harvest Fair]].

==History==
Originally from Neverwinter, Retta came to [[West Harbor]], when she became a widow. Once [[Lorne Starling|Lorne]] lost to [[Cormick]], she became more depressed, as she did not what became of him. Nevertheless, she continued her life with [[Bevil Starling|Bevil]] and other children.

During the Harvest Fair, she attended the Tourney of Talent and would reward the winners with some scrolls. When the [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] attacked the village, she barricaded herself, waiting for the [[Kalach-Cha]] and Bevil to rescue her children. After the battle, she wanted to know what happened of Lorne. Once the Kalach-Cha defeated Lorne, Retta learned of his son's fate.

After [[Ammon Jerro]] passed through the down, she died, but was revived as a shadow once the [[King of Shadows]] re-gained its power. She wanted to trick her youngest son to come with her, but was defeated by Kalach-Cha.

Retta has four children - 3 sons Lorne, Bevil and Danan, and a daughter around the age of Danan. Lorne died with the duel with [[Kalach-Cha]] or one of his/her companion, Danan died under the attack of [[King of Shadows]]'s troops, Bevil survived and continued working in [[Kalach-Cha]]'s [[Crossroad Keep]], and the situation of the daughter was unknown.
