At some point, the tribe was forced out of the territory they claimed as home by a tribe of orcs. One of the clan members, Geb, became lost in the dungeons as the Sharpticks fled. Eventually, the Veiled Ones came across the Sharpstick clan, helping them reclaim their homes and rescuing the lost ormyrr. Thankful for the adventurers help, Retha offered them safety to recuperate and offered to trade many of the magical and enchanted items the Sharpsticks had gathered throughout the ruins."
