        "mainbody": "'''Retha''' was the [[ormyrr]] chieftain of the [[Sharpstick clan]] who resided in the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Retha, like the rest of the Sharpstick clan, was a non-aggressive ormyrr, but nevertheless a competent warrior. Retha's [[Common]] language speech patterns were awkward and broken with the insertion of foreign words.",
        "Relationship": "Retha was friends with [[Geb (ormyrr)|Geb]], a fellow Sharpstick clan member.",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, Retha, along with the rest of the ormyrr of the Sharpstick clan, resided in the [[Halls of Light]] of Myth Drannor's Dwarven Dungeons. At some point, the tribe was forced out of the territory they claimed as home by a tribe of [[orc]]s. One of the clan members, Geb, became lost in the dungeons as the Sharpticks fled. Eventually, the [[Veiled Ones]] came across the Sharpstick clan, helping them reclaim their homes and rescuing the lost ormyrr. Thankful for the adventurers' help, Retha offered them safety to recuperate and offered to trade many of the magical and enchanted items the Sharpsticks had gathered throughout the ruins."
