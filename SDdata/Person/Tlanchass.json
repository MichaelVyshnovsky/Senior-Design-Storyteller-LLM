She revealed her true form there.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1294}}, Archveult was known to live with her, and she was known to lair somewhere in [[The Vast]], within a network of caverns that contained some shallow water, with an entrance hidden in the basement of what resembled a lonely cabin. After Archveult's death fighting an unknown [[dragon]], she spent a day mourning his death over the city of [[Raven's Bluff]]; the tears she shed became the ''[[Tears of the Dragon]]''. At dusk, she left for the west, and was never seen again; her hoard was still unfound as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nAfterwards, she was said to have taken up residence in [[Evermeet]], per [[Elminster]]. Other sources corroborated this datum."
