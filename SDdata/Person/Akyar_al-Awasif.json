Samia al-Said once freed Akyar from imprisonment, forever earning her gratitude and voluntary service. This was quite the reward for Samia, considering that Akyar was too powerful for even accomplished shairs to bind.\nAkyar acted as the representative of the genies in Rogostos court. She also served as the Sherif of the city and commanded over two hundred jann as well as four hundered ins guards that operated in Samias palace. However, Akyar spent much of her time playing match-maker between some of the younger members of the court.\nAkyar was inseparable from Samia."
