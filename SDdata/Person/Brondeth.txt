'''Brondeth of the Broken Staff''' was a [[human]] mage.

Alongside [[Auziiyra Twelvestars]] and several other mages, Brondeth was guarding a human mining community when they were attacked by [[drow]]. The mages used the ''[[wonderform]]'' spell to hide in the form of [[wingless wonder]]s and escape being killed, but became lost in the [[Underdark]]. They were thought to still be wandering the Night Below by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].
