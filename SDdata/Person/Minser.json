        "History": "Minser lived in the small village of [[Fairelm]] in [[shadovar]]-dominated Sembia.\n\nIn [[1480 DR]] he went to the [[Abbey of the Rose]] to ask to heal a ill uncle of him, becoming a follower of [[Amaunator]].\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Minser traveled to the [[Dalelands]] and [[Cormyr]] before going back to Fairelm.\n\nHowever, [[Sayeed]] and [[Zeeahd]] arrived in the village and when they discovered he knew about the Abbey they unleashed their pack of [[spined devil]]s to slaughter all the inhabitants except Minser and [[Elle]] in order to force Minser to show them the right way.\n\nAfterward, he out of fear agreed to show to [[Sayeed]] and [[Zeeahd]] the right way. So they decided to no need him more and unlashed the spines devils that killed him"
