        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. One of the Legion's surprise attacks herded a troop of goblins by magical means through underground tunnels into the Targos docks, where Brohn and his partners, [[Reig Redwaters]] and [[Honest Jon]], stood guard. Reig and Jon managed to survive, but Brohn was killed by a goblin [[arrow]] that pierced the man's throat."
