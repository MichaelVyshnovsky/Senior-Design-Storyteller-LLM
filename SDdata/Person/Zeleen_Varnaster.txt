'''Zeleen Varnaster''' was the leader of the [[wererat]] bandit group known as the [[Whiskered Gang]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Zeleen was ruthless and deceitful. She was more than willing to fight and to kill for what she wanted, and to lie to anyone she couldn't fight or kill.

==Relationships==
Although the members of her gang deferred to her leadership, they regarded her as easily replaceable.

==History==
During the late 15{{th}} century DR, Zeleen and her gang used the [[Shrine of Savras (Conyberry)|Shrine of Savras]] outside the ruins of [[Conyberry]] as a home base. However, when the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] arrived in the area and began driving monsters out of the [[Sword Mountains]], the wererats were chased away from the Shrine by a group of [[orc]]s. Zeleen soon led her gang to the [[Mountain's Toe]] [[gold]] mine, where they killed most of the miners, claimed the mine as their new home, and Zeleen began attempting to pass herself off as the mine overseer to any visitors who came snooping around. This put her on a collision course with [[Don-Jon Raskin]], the new overseer being sent by the mine's owners in [[Neverwinter]] around the same time.
