Anwar al-Sifr was the Cipher of Liham in 1367 DR, as well as the leader of its local chapter of the Brotherhood of the Everlasting.
A dark-skinned man, Anwar carried a stern expression on his face. He garbed himself in black and grey, and wore a red keffiyeh on his head, fastened with a black agal.
Deeply fanatical and violent, Anwar haunted the dark alleys of Liham. He preferred to stay emotionally detached to everyone, even his closest underlings.
Anwar owned a potion of flying, as well as a ring of feather falling. In combat, he wore a magical set of leather armor and wielded a mundane scimitar.
The goblin barber Bani Matruj al-Haddar actively tried to avoid Anwar.
Anwar al-Sifr was secretly a holy slayer who protected interests of the Brotherhood of the Everlasting in Liham, sometimes through the use of well-planned attacks where he would plant messages before making his escape. He would sometimes organize attacks on the mamluks of Qudra purely out of spite.
