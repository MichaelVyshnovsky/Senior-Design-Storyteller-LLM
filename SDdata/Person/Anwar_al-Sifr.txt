==Personality==
Deeply fanatical and violent, Anwar haunted the dark alleys of Liham. He preferred to stay emotionally detached to everyone, even his closest underlings.

Anwar owned a ''[[potion of flying]]'', as well as a ''[[ring of feather falling]]''. In combat, he wore a magical set of [[leather armor]] and wielded a mundane [[scimitar]].

The [[goblin]] [[barber]] [[Bani Matruj al-Haddar]] actively tried to avoid Anwar.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|40|Bani Matruj al-Haddar}}

==Activities==
Anwar al-Sifr was secretly a [[holy slayer]] who protected interests of the Brotherhood of the Everlasting in Liham, sometimes through the use of well-planned attacks where he would plant messages before making his escape. He would sometimes organize attacks on the [[mamluk]]s of [[Qudra]] purely out of spite.
