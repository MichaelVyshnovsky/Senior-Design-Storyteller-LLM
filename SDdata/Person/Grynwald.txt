Grynwald was a sailor who worked for the noble Seasilver family of Marsember during the late 15 century DR. He served as the first mate of the Wave Wyvern, the galleass owned by Grand Duke Farnig Seasilver.
He was tall and slender, with the tan skin and blonde beard that accompanied spending time at sea under the sun.
Grynwald was aboard the Wyvern when Lord Farnig and Lady Elira set sail from Marsember to Elversult escaping the Shadovar invasion of the city. While Lord Farnig was killed, Grynwald managed to survive the ordeal, staying aboard with Lady Elira as they presumably sailed to Westgate to find safe harbor with her family.
