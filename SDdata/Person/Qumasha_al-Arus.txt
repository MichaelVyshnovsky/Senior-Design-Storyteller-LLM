Qumasha al-Arus was a skilled flame mage inhabiting Krak al-Niraan in 1367 DR.
Qumasha was a strong woman who was very aggressive in the pursuit of her goals.
Qumashas innocent beauty was magnified by her athletic frame.
Though she was the second wife of Jamal al-Yindannim, Qumasha outwardly praised Jamals first wife, Najeeya bint Siddiq. However, Qumasha secretly drugged Najeeya with dreambliss to foster her addiction to the drug and keep her out of the picture.
Qumasha also helped train new flame mages who joined the ranks of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.
Qumasha was quite skilled at throwing daggers and carried several with her at all times. Each of these daggers was coated with dreambliss. She owned a sash of fire resistance, a ring of shocking grasp, and a potion of extra healing. She also carried several smoke spheres.
