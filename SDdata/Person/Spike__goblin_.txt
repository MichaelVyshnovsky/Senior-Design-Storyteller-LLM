Spike was the head torturer for the Cult of the Absolute that formed in the Sword Coast region of the Western Heartlands.
The goblin was a particularly vicious and malevolent individual, fitting in well with his role in the cult.
Spike worked alongside the Loviataran devotee Abdirak, under the leadership of Nightwarden Minthara Baenre.
At some point during the late 15 century DR, Spike and his fellow goblins burned a town to the ground, and apprehended a Flaming Fist soldier named Wyll. While his ally Fezzerk held Wyll down, Spike proceeded to pluck out the soldiers right eye from his skull.
Later on, Spike joined up with the cult of the Absolute using his unique set of skills to the cults advantage.
