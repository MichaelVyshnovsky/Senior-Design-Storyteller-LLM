'''Gallor''' was an "archaeologist" of sorts who partnered with one [[Charleston Nib]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Another perhaps more accurate description for Gallor was that of a "tomb raider".

==Activities==
Unlike his partner Charleston, Gallor felt their team would be well-suited to sell the ancient items and [[artifact]]s they found, rather than donate them to museums.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Gallor and Charleston began excavation on the [[Sword Coast]] and uncovered a long-extinct temple-village. The inhabitants of this ancient settlement once worshiped the god [[Kozah]].

During the dig, Gallor planned on having Charleston killed and taking over their operation.
