Glishman the Annoying was a wizard who lived in Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Glishman lived in a red run-down two-story house on Magicians Row with a shield over the door. It was the third of five houses.
Glishman had a toad familiar, smoked Golden Sea tobacco, and was primarily a milk drinker.
Circa 1357 DR, the City Guard serving Regent of the Exchequer Vernon Condor considered Glishman the Annoying for the theft of two minor magic items of historical importance from the city vaults, after suspicions and divinations tracked the thieves to Magicians Row. However, Glishman was innocent.
