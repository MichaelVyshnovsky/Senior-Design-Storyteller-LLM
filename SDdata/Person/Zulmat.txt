'''Zulmat''', also simply called '''The Darkness''', was a terror of [[Jumlat]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] region of [[west Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} 

==Activities==
Zulmat's calling card depended on his victim. Moneylenders' wrists were broken and their throats were cut. Wicked sea captains were left on the beach like flotsam with lungs full of sea water. Corrupt city guards were stripped naked and dumped into [[al-Fatir River]].

Jumlat's Chief Vizier, [[Agat amir-Doth]] had yet to unravel the mystery of the Darkness as of 1367 DR.

==Rumors & Legends==
The exact nature of this individual remained unclear. They could have been a man or a woman and a [[human]] or perhaps even a [[genie]]. Others believed the Darkness was a society and not just one individual.
