However, they met a fake Elminster instead a group of doppelgangers, one of which Mereld was commanded to blast away rather than let it get away. Later, they came across another fake Elminster, this one being actually the noblewoman Storm Silverhand. She deftly outmaneuvered the group and convinced Eskrel Starbridge to hand over a teleport ring Mereld questioned why, but didnt push the matter afterwards."
