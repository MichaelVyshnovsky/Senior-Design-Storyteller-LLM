        "History": "Mereld was one of the War Wizards tapped by the highknight [[Eskrel Starbridge]] for his mission to [[Shadowdale]], seeking to apprehend the fugitive [[Elminster Aumar]] personally. However, they met a fake Elminster instead: a group of [[doppelganger]]s, one of which Mereld was commanded to blast away rather than let it get away. Later, they came across another fake Elminster, this one being actually the noblewoman [[Storm Silverhand]]. She deftly outmaneuvered the group and convinced Eskrel Starbridge to hand over a ''[[teleport ring]]''; Mereld questioned why, but didn't push the matter afterwards."
