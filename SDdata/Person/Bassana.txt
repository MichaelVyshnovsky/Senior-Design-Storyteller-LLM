'''Bassana''' was a spy of [[Golconda]] in [[Turmish]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Bassana was one of the agents of [[Boubakar]] of Golconda.

==History==
In [[1355 DR]], [[Yrkhetep|Hetep]], the self-styled king of [[Muktar]] started a war against Golconda. In 1358 DR, Bassana went to spy inside Muktar but was captured by the king of Muktar, who used a [[hypnosis]] power to manipulate Bassana into believing that he had discovered that Hetep's battle plans were hidden in the small keep of [[Fort Blood]]. Bassana reported the news to his master Boubakar.

Still in Yrkhetep's power, he eventually helped an adventuring party King [[Samakay]] had hired to resolve the matter (and Yrkhetep's true objective) to escape from Count [[Belim]].
