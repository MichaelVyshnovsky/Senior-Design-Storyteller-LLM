Gelduth Blackturret was the Watchlord of Thentia in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As of 1373, he was solidly built and dour-looking. He wore a chain of office, a black velvet doublet, and carried a gold-hilted sword in a golden scabbard.
Gelduth Blackturret was the Watchlord by 1367 DR and during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR. He dealt with the mages in Firefingers tower, communicating the concerns of the noble families after Samdralyrion fell to the Rage.
