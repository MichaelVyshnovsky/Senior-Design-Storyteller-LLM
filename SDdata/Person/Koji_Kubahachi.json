        "mainbody": "'''Koji Kubahachi''' was a head of the [[Kubahachi]] clan and a [[daimyo]] of [[Aru Province]] in [[Wa]] during the early 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].",
        "Personality": "As a ruler, Koji was a cruel strong-man with a nasty temper and an excessive vindictive streak.",
        "History": "Most notoriously, in {{YearlinkConvert|1713|WY}}, when Koji levied a special tax to pay for castle improvements and a certain fishing village fell short, Koji killed every inhabitant, razed it, salted the earth, and did the same to two neighboring villages, insisting they must been aware of a plot to defraud him.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|1717|WY}}, two [[ninja]]s infiltrated [[Aru]] disguised as [[pilgrim]]s and tried to assassinate Koji. They were killed in the attack, Koji couldn't identify who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this excess, shogun [[Masanori]] gave Koji \"permission\" to \"take the final step on the road of life\", and returned the daimyate to the [[Matsutomo]] clan, under [[Masakito Matsutomo]].<ref>"
