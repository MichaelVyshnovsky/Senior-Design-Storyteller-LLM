They were killed in the attack, Koji couldnt identify who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this excess, shogun Masanori gave Koji \"permission\" to \"take the final step on the road of life\", and returned the daimyate to the Matsutomo clan, under Masakito Matsutomo."
