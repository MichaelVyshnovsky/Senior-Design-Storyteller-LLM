Lord '''Challas Amcathra''' was the patriarch of the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble]] [[Amcathra]] family of [[Waterdeep]] throughout the late 13{{th}} and over half the 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Description==
Challas Amcathra used ''[[potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]'' to grant himself and his wife unusually long lives, achieving the milestone of becoming a centenarian.

==Relationships==
He had six older brothers, all of whom died to one unfortunate circumstance or another.

Lord Challas was married to Lady [[Miri Amcathra|Miri]], and the father of nine children as well as the grandfather of nineteen grandchildren. Most notable of his sires were [[Arilos Amcathra|Arilos]], his eldest son and heir apparent,

==History==
During his youth, Challas Amcathra was one of the more promising [[adventurer]]s that traveled the [[Sword Coast]]. But around the {{YearlinkName|1293}}, he was forced to abandon that lifestyle and take on the role as lord of the Amcathra family.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the aged Challas and Lady Miri traveled to Shadowdale to visit their son Mourngrym. Unfortunately, their visit preceded the invasion of Shadowdale by the [[Zhentarim Occupying Army]]. The Waterdhavian nobles were imprisoned by the Zhents within the dungeons of the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] for a time.
