        "mainbody": "Lord Pharnth Aelorothi was a feyri diviner of House Aelorothi of Siluvanede and a member of the daemonfey in 1369 DR.\nHe had a wiry build and a hawk-like nose. His bald head was adorned with many mystical tattoos.\nAs a feyri, Pharnth had the unique powers to cast clairaudience and ESP once a day each, and was resistant to fire and electricity.\nPharnths consort was Saesaan Aelorothi.\nPharnth was the lord and patriarch of the Aelorothi feyri among the daemonfey. His duties were to spy on the enemies of House Dlardrageth, which he did remotely with his divination powers, and he reported to Ryvvik Dlardrageth and his intelligence-gathering networks. He was a voice of restraint in the daemonfey council, and thus was increasingly sidelined.\nPharnth was very cautious."
