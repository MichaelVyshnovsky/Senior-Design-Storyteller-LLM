        "History": "Around [[1363 DR]], Xovliax claimed a section of the [[Melairbode]] as its lair but was soon possessed by the [[ghost]] of the Laird [[Besender Melairkyn]]. Somehow the possession became permanent and the personalities of the [[dwarf]] and of the deepspawn fused together.\n\nSo Xovliax started spawning [[dwarves]] in order to form a new dwarven community inside the dungeon, [[Murkstones]]. However, the spawned dwarves were a failure and often Xovliax sent them on suicide missions. Meanwhile, however, many dwarf outcasts and some [[duergar]] joined Murkstones.",
