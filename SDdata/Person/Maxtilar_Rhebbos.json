        "History": "Maxtilar lived as a member of the Tempuran clergy of the [[House of Heroes]] temple in [[Waterdeep]] from [[1357 DR]] and through [[1368 DR]].\n\nIn [[1363 DR]], Maxtilar sponsored a ship alongside the local [[Church of Sune|clergy of Sune]], known as ''[[Goddess' Glory]]''. This ship was meant to deliver a load of precious statuary to the [[Temple of Beauty]], but it mysteriously sank just south of the city. Unbeknownst to them, the sinking of the ''Goddess' Glory'' was caused by [[Kerritas Reefsilver]], a member of the [[Cult of Ao]], and two [[merfolk]]. They pilfered the statuary to place within a small temple to [[Deep Sashelas]], situated in an underwater reef just outside of the [[Deepwater Harbor]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/94/The Cult of Ao: Who Watches Those who Watch over You?|12-13}}"
