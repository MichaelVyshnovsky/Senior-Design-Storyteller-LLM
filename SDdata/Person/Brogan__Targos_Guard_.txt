'''Brogan''' was an inhabitant of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] and a member of the [[Targos Guard]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Brogan was a [[human]] man armored in Targos Guard's [[leather armor|leathers]] and a horned [[helmet]]. He was armed with a [[dagger]] and a [[battleaxe]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of Targos became besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. One of the Legion's surprise attacks teleported a troop of [[goblin]]s into the Targos docks, where Brogan was among the guards. He managed to trap a large group of goblins in one of the warehouses and attempted to get aid from one of the adventuring bands hired by Targos, the [[Iron Collar Band]], who were more interested in drinking at the [[The Salty Dog Tavern]] than working. Time was of the essence for Brogan, as if the goblins started a fire in the warehouse, the resulting blaze would consume the entire docks area.
