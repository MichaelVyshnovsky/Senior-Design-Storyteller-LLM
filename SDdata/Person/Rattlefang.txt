Rattlefang was a gnoll chieftain and shaman who led a tribe in the Wild Hills of Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR.
Rattlefang was a cruel and vicious gnoll with tattoos that decorated his arms and chest. Rattlefangs face was scarred and tattooed with two malicious black eyes that betrayed the gnolls cunning, rare among his kin.
The shaman wore Rattlefangs talisman, a magical talisman, decorated with bones and chunks of fried flesh.
Rattlefangs tribe, at some point before 1372 DR, controlled the old toll house in the Wild Hills that stood atop a natural bridge across a deadly chasm that split the area. The gnolls collected tolls from travelers, living profitable lives. Eventually, the orge tribe, under the leadership of Guruk Bonesnap, took the toll house and forced the gnolls out. Rattlefang led his tribe to claim a ruined stone structure in the Wild Hills, calling it their "stronghold" and lairing in a cave that had an entrance underneath the razed building. From there, Rattlefang plotted to take the old toll house back from the ogre enemies. The gnoll shaman sought help to defeat his adversaries and even tried to enlist the Hero of Daggerford. However, it was not known which of the two factions ended up controlling the toll house.
