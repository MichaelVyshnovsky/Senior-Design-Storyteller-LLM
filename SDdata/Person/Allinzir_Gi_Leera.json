        "mainbody": "Allinzir Gileera was a proxy of Vhaeraun, the Dark Seldarine deity of thievery and treachery. He was also the sole individual among Vhaerauns proxies &mdash who for their own safety tried to avoid attention and keep their identities secret &mdash that was publicly known.\nLike all of Vhaerauns proxies, Allinzir was a male drow.\nAllinzir was an incredibly subtle and constantly scheming individual. He carried himself with an air of smooth pleasantness and a cold smile that almost never faltered. He always looked for indirect or roundabout solutions to any problem he faced, even if a straightforward one was available.\nAllinzir possessed the same abilities that were given to all of Vhaerauns proxies. This included trusight, a catlike grace, abilities related to thievery, and abilities related to striking at creatures that could only be harmed by magical weapons.\nUnlike other drow, Allinzir was uniquely unaffected by sunlight. And he could disappear into the shadows, even while being watched, then reappear elsewhere.\nAllinzir operated in the shadows, working against the machinations of the Dark Seldarine goddess Lolth, just like all proxies of Vhaeraun. Beyond this duty as Vhaerauns proxy, Allinzir operated as a member of the planar faction known as the Revolutionary League."
