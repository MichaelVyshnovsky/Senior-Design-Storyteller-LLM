'''Roanmara Neirdre''' was a [[gold elf]] priestess of [[Labelas Enoreth]] from the elven realm of [[Siluvanede]]. She was a member of [[House Neirdre]].<ref>

She died and became an undying [[baelnorn]]. By [[1370 DR]], she had served her god for millennia at the [[Temple Beyond Time]] in [[Mhiilamniir]] in neighboring [[Eaerlann]].

Alongside [[Susklahava Orbryn]] and [[Phantyni Evanara]], she was one of the Timespinners: historians, oracles, sages, and seers whose advice was sought by the faithful on the temple's occasional returns to the normal time-stream.
