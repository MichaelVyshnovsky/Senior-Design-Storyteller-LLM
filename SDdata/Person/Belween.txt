'''Belween''' was the second bastard son of [[Berellip Xorlarrin]].

==History==
In [[1484 DR]], in preparation for the [[drow]] [[Darkening|war]] against the [[Silver Marches]], Belween, under the orders of [[Tiago Baenre]] and [[Ravel Xorlarrin]], disguised himself as the [[orc]] prince [[Lorgru]], who had been kidnapped previously. So disguised, Belween killed the king of [[Many-Arrows]], [[Obould XVII]].
