        "mainbody": "Zeran was a half-elf cleric of Leira and adventurer of the Puppetmasters company circa 1369 DR.\nZeran affected a mysterious persona, and considered herself far superior to her victims, regarding them with sneering contempt.\nZeran carried a magical horsemans mace and wore chain mail and a cloak of displacement. She also carried potions of healing and her holy symbol of Leira, a black disk.\nZeran had an array of divine spells and abilities for her work, which mainly supported her allies and disabled her enemies via illusions and trickery.\nIn 1369 DR, the Puppetmasters came up with a scheme to win an easy prize for the company. They planted a letter and treasure map leading to the dungeon of Barrenstone, allowing another adventuring group to excavate and clear out the complex. When they emerged from the dungeon with the treasure, the Puppetmasters attempted to rob their victims, only to be driven off and receive nothing for their troubles."
