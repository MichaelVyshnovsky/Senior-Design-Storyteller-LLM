Jonslyn Windtongue was a halfling thief of some infamy, who operated in Amn, Tethyr, the Nelanther Isles, and sometimes even on the coastal lands of the Shining Sea in the late 14 century DR.
In the late 14 century DR, Jonslyn Windtongue managed to steal one of Lantanna spellwebs. These weapons fed off magic, enchantments, and spells, unleashed and still held within a casters mind. As such, spellwebs were rumored to be weapons used in defense of Lantan from pirates and other invading forces. The Ayrorch, the Council of Twelve dispatched the Hands of Gond to find the halfling thief and return what was stolen by all means.
Jonslyn went on a run and was rumored to hide somewhere in the lands of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
