'''Gaumahavi''', also called the '''Purple Dragon''', was a unique [[dragon|greater purple dragon]] from the [[Hordelands]].

==Description==
Outwardly, Gaumahavi looked very similar to an [[oriental dragon]], possessing a long sinuous body that measured well over a hundred feet long.

==Abilities==
As the "Great Dragon of the Desert Winds," Gaumahavi had complete control over the wind within a 500 yd. radius of herself, allowing for awesome displays of power.

Her breath weapon was a large cloud of suffocating purple dust.

Gaumahavi could take any shape she desired and could revert to an [[Astral Plane|astral form]] at will.

==History==
Thousands of years in the distant past, Gaumahavi was a pet [[leopard]] of [[Surtava]], an Ulgarian prince. Because of her close proximity to the Padhra, she developed her own soul, allowing her to reincarnate herself into different forms including that of the great purple dragon.

During the [[War of the Purple Dragon]], Gaumahavi, along with the army of [[Solon]], sacked the city of [[Kushk]] located along the [[Jumpa River]] near [[Ra-Khati]].
