        "Activities": "In the city of Kuda, Joei managed a very lucrative business of importing exotic items under licenses by both the emperor and the [[shogun]]. He often disappeared for months or even years searching for items with his ship. Even when Joei was in the city, nobody knew his true activities. Many thieves met their end entering his warehouse. People spread rumors that Joei acquired his licenses by doing illegal deeds for the emperor and shogun.",
