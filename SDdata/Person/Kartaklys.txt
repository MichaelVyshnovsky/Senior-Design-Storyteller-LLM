Kartaklys was a Netherese archwizard.
In , this archwizard began to create his own flying enclave, and started the crucial stage of shaving off the top of a mountain. It was believed that a rival archwizard, Buoyance, interrupted Kartaklys plans by casting trap the soul on him. Kartaklys, his life-force trapped, was unable to react as the mountain top fell atop him, ending his life.
