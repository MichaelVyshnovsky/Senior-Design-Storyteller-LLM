Puce was a goblin warrior who served as a novice in the cult of the Absolute. He served his goddess at the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.
Puce had orange-brown skin that he decorated with blue war paint. He wore salvaged metal armor and carried upon his back a large axe.
After cult raiders sacked Waukeens Rest in the , Puce and a handful of other goblins were sent on guard duty rather than allowed to celebrate at a grand feast.
