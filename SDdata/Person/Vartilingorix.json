When he appeared in the [[Valley of the Ancients]] in the swamp, Vartilingorix was slain by a collective of adventurers working with Acolyte [[Heiron]] of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]]. \n\nThe black' dragon's remains lay embedded into the muddy ground of the valley, and no natural creature would scavenge from it. One year after his death, agents of the Cult of the Dragon returned to the site of his death to recover the dragon's essence."
