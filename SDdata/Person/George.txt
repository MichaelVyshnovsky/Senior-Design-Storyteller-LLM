George was a mean-spirited talking raven who served Sememmon of Darkhold in the late 14 century DR.
George was a pitch-black raven. His personality was abrasive and aggressive. The birds colorful tongue constantly threatened those around him with violence and eating their corpses. George was not threatened by cats and boasted that he would eat a cats heart from the inside if he ever were to be swallowed. He was afraid of falcons, visibly becoming nervous at a mere mention of these birds of prey. George also considered them to be "sneaks and cheats."
Georges true nature remained a mystery. Some time before the , the bird became bound to serve wizard Sememmon for a set period of time. However, the wizard did not wish to reveal the reasons for Georges servitude but did clarify that the raven was not a familiar. Despite the birds foul attitude and abrupt manner, George served his master and the masters cause well.
In 1372 DR, George accompanied Sememmon and two other agents loyal to him – Beowen and Miyandra, to the area surrounding the city of Daggerford that became the target of a Zhentarim takeover plot. Sememmon took on the guise of a Harper agent named Teygan and camped in a cavern outside of the city. When a group of adventurers emerged acting against the Zhent plot, Sememmon seized the opportunity and approached the person who would later be known as the Hero of Daggerford. The "Harper" invited the Hero to his hideout and fed the Hero intel, resulting in ruining Fzoul Chembryls attempts to claim Daggerford. The Hero of Daggerford met George at the "Harper" hideout and was not amused by the birds attitude, eventually threatening the raven with the Heros brother – a falconer.
