        "mainbody": "Lasaonar was a drow swordmaster who lived in Ust Natha.\nHe was known to participate in duels in the Ust Natha tavern duel arena.\nIn 1369 DR, Gorions Ward, when disguised as a drow, had the chance to watch Lasaonar fight four people at once in the tavern. After this, Gorions Ward and his party were offered to fight Lasaonar in a duel themselves.\nLasaonar wore drow-made adamantine full plate armor and carried two enchanted swords that were similarly made of adamantine. Whereas one of these was an ordinary drow-made longsword, as carried by several other drow, the other was actually the Blade of Searing, a bastard sword that struck with fire and was made of a special alloy that would endure the sunlight once taken back to the surface, unlike other drow-made items.\nIt was rumored that he would give up his bastard sword to Gorions Ward, if defeated by one of his group in combat.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryDuelists\nCategoryInhabitants of Ust Natha\nCategoryInhabitants of Old Shanatar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Ust Natha tavern\nf9fic1s9xfd87t5sde34pypv0m3luym"
