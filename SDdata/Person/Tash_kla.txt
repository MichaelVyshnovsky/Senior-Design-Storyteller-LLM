'''Tash'kla''' was a priestess of [[Eilistraee]].

==History==
Tash'kla was one of the [[Protectors of the Song]] in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].

In [[1377 DR]], she was one of the six Protectors chosen for an assault led by [[Cavatina Xarann]] on the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]].

In [[1379 DR]] Tash'kla was killed by an [[ooze]] during the attack of the [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers to the Promenade but Cavatina hoped to resurrect her later.
