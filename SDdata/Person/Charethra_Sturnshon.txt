Charethra Sturnshon was one of the middle daughters of Hlargrim Sturnshon, who along with her eight sisters worked at the Dryads Dreams, the only festhall in Mosstone, Tethyr in the mid-to-late-14 century DR.
Like all of her sisters, Charethra had long silky brown hair, king the color of ivory, and large cheerful dark eyes. She wore the Dryads uniform, a sewn leather gown resembling that of an actual dryad, a dress made out of green-dyed leather leaves.
Charethra, Braetha, Kalaeria, Hestroone, and her five other sisters all worked at the Dryads Dreams with their father. The women were in charge of serving food and drinks to the customers and entertained them, giving rubdown to sore muscles of foresters and rangers at the end of a long workday. The women greeted the clients with cheery attitudes and affectionate body language. On occasion, they perform a limited assortment of medical procedures, such as setting dislocated joints or fingers in for the locals.
