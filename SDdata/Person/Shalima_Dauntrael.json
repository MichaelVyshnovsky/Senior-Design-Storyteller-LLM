        "Rumors & Legends": "She was said to have never married, but to seek to conceive a child; the man she ultimately went to was a [[marilith]] in disguise, and the child would slay her upon birth. In response, she sought every spell she could muster from a dozen mages (some given willingly, some not as much) to alter the nature of her child without slaying it. Her child, whom she named [[Hemtor Dauntrael|Hemtor]], ultimately had only a few [[tanar'ri]] traits upon birth."
