'''Xanthon Cormaeril''' was a member of the [[Cormaeril]] noble family of [[Cormyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He became the sixth [[ghazneth]], called '''Xanthon the Baneful''' and the '''Scourge of Swarms'''.{{Cite dragon annual/1999/The Dragon's Bestiary: Ghazneths|114,120}}

==History==
Xanthon was one of House Cormaeril's more adventurous youths. He traveled the [[Heartlands]] in search of wealth and excitement, and in the process often irritated a foreign merchant or monarch to the point that his family needed to use its influence to free him from foreign justice.

After [[Gaspar Cormaeril]]'s involvement in the [[abraxus affair]] and failed coup in [[1369 DR]], the Cormaeril family was stripped of land and title, with several members being imprisoned or put to death. Xanthon swore to have revenge on King [[Azoun IV]] and betrayed his realm, and thereby turned into a ghazneth. In [[1370 DR]], he unleashed the buried scourges to destroy [[Cormyr]].

==Powers==
As a ghazneth, Xanthon had surprising speed and power, which allowed him to overwhelm and kill [[Emperel Ruousk]], along with many other victims. Xanthon had the power to control swarms of poisonous creatures, from wasps and scorpions to even large snakes.
