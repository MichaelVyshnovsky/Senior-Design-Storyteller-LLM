Nimra, nicknamed Nimra Ninehands after one of her spells, was a wizard of Myth Drannor who became imprisoned in the shape of a magical staff until the midâ€“14 century DR.
She was slim and grey-eyed, but her eyes turned clear blue shortly after her imprisonment ended.
As a staff, she was a length of smooth-polished shadowtop wood.
Nimra was imprisoned in the shape of a staff by a rival, Nerndel, around the year , 700 years prior to . Before that time, she had imprisoned herself a number of creatures that her own imprisonment released these things sought her out unsuccessfully, as her imprisonment made her nigh-impossible to find.
Nimras imprisonment came as she owed Nerndel six services. Her first service was to train him her second service was to turn herself into a staff. However, her imprisonment made it impossible for her to complete the first service either. Elminster Aumar also stole from Nerndel the spells that bound her, and made it impossible to release her, so that she would remain safe while her seekers were destroyed.
Nerndel later bequeathed his staff unto Tarth Hornwood, who nearly used up her power (and thus her lifeforce), adventuring across the Dragon Reach and Myth Drannor. When Tarth later sought training from Elminster Aumar in late Mirtul of 1360 DR, the mage requested that his payment be the staff- or rather, its destruction. Nerndel sought out Sarlin to create a duplicate of his staff, so as to destroy that one instead Elminster saw through the ruse, and Tarth finally destroyed the staff, releasing Nimra.
After her release, Nimra was to complete Tarth Hornwoods training, as he was the heir of Nerndel, whose web of spells still bound her.
