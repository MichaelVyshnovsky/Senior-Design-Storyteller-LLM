Cori Shorard was one of innkeepers of the Northern Light, located on the east side of Caer-Konig during the late 15 century DR.
She was a stout woman who often wore a glowering expression on her face.
Cori handled all the cooking and preparation of supplies as the Northern Light.
Cori and her younger sister Allie often disagreed with one another about how to run the Northern Light. Cori believed that her sister had little knowledge about how to properly run an inn. While their arguments never ceased, they never escalated to anything more serious.
