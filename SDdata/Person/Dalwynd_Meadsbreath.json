        "mainbody": "'''Dalwynd Meadsbreath''' was an adventuring [[hin]] [[wizard]] member of the [[The Winter Rose]] from the [[North Faerûn]].",
        "Appearance": "Dalwynd Meadsbreath adventuring robes trimmed with crimson. His pie-thieving past left the wizard with a set of roguish skills, evident by his nimbleness and use of [[throwing knives]] and [[crossbow]]s. He was a talented diplomat and had a knack for the [[enchantment]] school of ''[[the Art]]''.",
        "History": "Dalwynd Meadsbreath hailed from a tiny [[hin]] Shire in the north. He was renowned among his kin for being the most notorious pie thief that has even operated in the Shire. However, despite his heinous crimes against the good halfling folk of the Shire, Dalwynd has never faced the consequences thanks to his natural charisma and ability to talk his way out of almost any situation. One day, a group of adventurers known as the [[Winter Rose]] passed through the hin hamlet, and the young pie-thieving wizard decided to join them on a grand adventure. Surprisingly, the folk of the Shire were sad to see Dalwynd Meadsbreath go; they missed him more than they missed all the stolen pies. Dalwynd Meadsbreath, along with [[Llendril Coe]], was the last to join the adventuring fellowship. Together, they quickly learned to bring levity to any situation and lighten their new friends' hearts."
