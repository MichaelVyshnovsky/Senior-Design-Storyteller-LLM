She was charged with enforcing the ''\"King's Code\"'' in town of [[Moranay]] and was fair and just in her service to the realm.{{Cite dungeon/137/Man Forever}}",
        "Description": "Telda was a dark-skinned woman with handsome features.",
        "History": "Although her parents hailed from [[Turmish]], Teda was born in [[Agmoth]] county and never traveled to her ancestral homeland. She had a successful military career, having served in the [[Royal Guard (Impiltur)|Queen's Guard]] and the [[City Watch (Hlammach)|City Watch]] of [[Hlammach]] before joining the Royal Constabulary.\n\nWhen a coven of [[Shar]]ran [[hag]]s infiltrated Moranay during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Teda was one of the first citizens that was ''[[dominate person|dominated]]''. For several [[tenday]]s, the hags used her as a thrall to confirm the lies they spread about the seemingly immortal [[Salumbrar Chaseris|Lord Salumbrar]], going so far as to impersonate her by means of the spell ''[[veil]]''. The manipulated Teda confirmed reports about slain animals and [[vampire]] attacks, that reinforced the \"rumors\" that Lord Salumbrar had succumbed to [[undead|undeath]] and was slaughtering his own people. The coven used Teda's status as Royal Constable to manipulate the citizens of Moranay, insisting that she was \"busy investigating the matter\" all the while preventing the [[Lords of Imphras II]] from dispatching any additional forces to uncover the truth of the matter.\n\n{{sectstub}}"
