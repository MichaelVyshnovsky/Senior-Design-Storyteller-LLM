'''Jargus Holenhond''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Ilmater]] and a member of the [[Order of the Golden Cup]] in the midâ€“13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Jargus Holenhond rose to a position of leadership in the Order of the Golden Cup by the 1260s DR.

Around [[1265 DR]], Archsufferer [[Bloirt Waelarn]] of the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] had denounced his fellow Ilmatari priests of the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] for refusing to relinquish the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the faith. The Mussum priests and the [[Companions of the Noble Heart]] attacked Waelarn and his followers, labeling them "false clerics" and "subverted by evil". An angry Waelarn summoned the Order of the Golden Cup, as well as the [[Holy Warriors of Suffering]] and [[Knights of the Bleeding Shield]], to his side and vowed holy war against the "unclean ones of Mussum" and their allies. The war saw the violent clashes of [[Holy Hill Farm]] in [[1266 DR]] and [[Bronsheir's Charge]] and [[Weeping Rock (Ilmater)|Weeping Rock]] in [[1267 DR]]. Jargus Holenhond was among those Golden Cup paladins who fought in the war.

Finally, in [[1267 DR|Year of the Groaning Hart, 1267 DR]], Lord Sir Jargus Holenhond called an end to the bloodshed between "true Sufferers all". He insisted that the ''Tome of Torment'' be transferred to Keltar as planned, and blamed Bloirt Waelarn for the senseless violence, naming him "the cause of all this needless, evil slaughter". Jargus determined that Waelarn should be removed from office and sent into hermitage on the isle of [[Falconsrise]] for the remainder of his years. The weary paladins accepted and carried out his judgment.
