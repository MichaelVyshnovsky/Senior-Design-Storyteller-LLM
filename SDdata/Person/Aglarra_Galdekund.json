        "mainbody": "'''Aglarra Galdekund''' is the wife of the merchant [[Flammos Galdekund]] of [[Waterdeep]]. In [[1369 DR]], Queen [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] assumed her appearance in order to hide in Waterdeep during the [[abraxus affair]]. The change in mannerisms and voice was blamed on an illness, that the couple had to travel to [[Iritue's Firesprings]] in southern [[Amn]] in order to address. Aglarra is short and masculine in appearance, with a pot belly and a large, pimpled chin.",
