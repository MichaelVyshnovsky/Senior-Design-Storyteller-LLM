'''Leyla Wildwood''' was a [[human]] [[proxy]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[power]] known as [[Chauntea]]. She was one of the two primary proxies in that goddess's [[divine realm]], the [[Great Mother's Garden]].

==Personality==
Embodying the more wilder, rural aspect of her power, Leyla preferred the company of wild things growing freely over the measured growth of farms.

==Relationships==
Leyla got along quite well with [[Tallas Greenfellow]], Chauntea's other primary proxy in the Great Mother's Garden.
