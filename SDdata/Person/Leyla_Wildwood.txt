Leyla Wildwood was a human proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Chauntea. She was one of the two primary proxies in that goddesss divine realm, the Great Mothers Garden.
Embodying the more wilder, rural aspect of her power, Leyla preferred the company of wild things growing freely over the measured growth of farms.
Leyla got along quite well with Tallas Greenfellow, Chaunteas other primary proxy in the Great Mothers Garden.
