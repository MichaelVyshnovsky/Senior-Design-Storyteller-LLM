Myrelas the Gallant was the leader of the Peerless Champions of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, as of 1479 DR.
Myrelas was a male doppleganger. He was flamboyant and well mannered, and liked to be finely dressed at all occasions. He was noble, valiant, and chivalrous to a fault, even in situations where his life was at a stake.
Myrelas wore a leather cuirass and a large plumed hat. He also carried an extravagant rapier.
Myrelas was the husband of Iphimedra.
Myrelas was the leader of the Peerless Champions, a troupe of "bravos" (blademasters) or vigilantes that patrolled the city of Sambral.
Myrelas was the self-proclaimed rival of Davien Mecatoris.
In 1479 DR, Iphimedra was kidnapped by the Cult of Reborn Flame to be a sacrifice to the primordial Achazar. Myrelas joined forces with a band of adventurers to rescue her and to stop the cult for good.
After that, Myrelas joined the adventurers and helped them in their fights against the cult in Harglast and Ramekho.
In 1480 DR, they faced Pyrultimus, but were defeated and Pyrultimus cursed them with madness. A few weeks later, they went to Tarmalune seeking help from Halagothra the Healer, who was unable to help them.
After having being cured, Myrelas joined forces again with the adventurers to defeat Pyrultimus, this time for good.
After having defeated the cult, Myrelas and Iphimedra married.
