'''Hyacinth''' was the [[gnome|gnomish]] guildmaster of the [[Guild of Watermen]] in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|14}}<ref group="note" name="Year" />

{{Quote|''I rose quickly in the Watermen’s guild. It’s possible some people got hurt along the way.''|The [[ghost]] of Hyacinth{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|36}}}}

==Description==
Hyacinth constantly exuded a heavy floral scent, which he claimed was just a natural part of his [[fey]] nature expressing itself.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|12}}

==Personality==
Hyacinth was a rather brash and hard-nosed individual during his time in the Guild of Watermen. Over time, retirement made him more complacent and mellow, though he was still hard to bargain with. He also had a finely trained sense of telling whenever someone was lying to him.

==History==
One evening in [[1459 DR]], a [[Masked Lord]] visited Hyacinth and promised him [[gold]] if he would arrange for four Watermen to visit a certain tavern that night. Said Watermen had previously done a job for the Masked Man, smuggling a couple chests on to a ship bound for [[Amn]], but then later drunkenly bragged about it. Hyacinth took the Masked Lord up on his offer and that night the four Watermen ended up being stabbed in a bar fight. He kept silent about the incident and a month later he was getting paid more gold and was receiving support for a higher office within the guild for recruiting new Watermen that worked as [[assassin]]s for the Masked Lord.

In [[1474 DR]], Hyacinth retired from his role as guildmaster. Five years later he began exploring more of his spiritual side and was studying to become a [[priest]] of [[Garl Glittergold]].

In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note" name="Year" /> on the night of [[Fleetswake]], Hyacinth was to be honored with an award for his support of the Guild of Watermen’s health and safety fund.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|12}} found their bodies mutilated within a ship wreckage in [[Mistshore]]. Each of them were inside of an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] torturer's rack that bound their souls and prevented them from speaking on their own.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|16}} 

The body of Hyacinth was found missing both of his arms and legs, which was reflected by his [[ghost]] when he and the other victims arose to confront the adventurers. After possessing one of them to speak, they managed to make him confess his sins and he spoke of the incident with the Masked Lord that had occurred twenty years prior.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|17}} After they learned the identities of three shipping merchants that the trio had betrayed, the ghosts of all men departed.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|18}}

The adventurer that Hyacinth had possessed to communicate with the group was left with a lasting reminder of the incident, as from then on flowers would wilt and die upon coming into physical contact with them.
