Ahlysaaria YrilLysaen was a female drow cleric of Lolth and a member of the mercantile House Lysaen of the city of Karsoluthiyl in 1370 DR.
She was chosen to lead a group of three other priestesses and a 32-strong hunting party of her house to establish a hold on Level Two of Undermountain, with the goal of rebuilding an ancient slave-trading route to the surface, in order to bypass the route used by House TanorThal, the ruling house of Karsoluthiyl.
Ahlyssaria had an aunt named Aranea SrixLysaen.
