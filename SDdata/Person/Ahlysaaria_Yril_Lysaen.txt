She was chosen to lead a group of three other priestesses and a 32-strong hunting party of her house to establish a hold on Level Two of Undermountain, with the goal of rebuilding an ancient slave-trading route to the surface, in order to bypass the route used by House TanorThal, the ruling house of Karsoluthiyl.
Ahlyssaria had an aunt named Aranea SrixLysaen.
