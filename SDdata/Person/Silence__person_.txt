Silence was the elven monk who owned an enchanted sling called Ricochet before 1372 DR.
The name "Silence" was the name given to the monk because of his vows of silence taken so far in the past that no one remembered the elfs true name. Many parts of the monks life were relatively unknown due to his quiet life. However, one story was well known. At one point, Silence was pursued by an arcane archer who chased the man into a catacomb system. Armed with nothing but his fists, wits, and an enchanted sling, Silence found himself driven into a dead end. As a final resort, the monk aimed at the archers silhouette and used all of his strength to shoot a bullet at his pursuer. The projectile bounced and ricocheted off the catacombs stone walls and struck the arcane archer in the chest, earning the slings name. Silence seized a moment, and while the archer was momentarily stunned, the monk knocked him out with a flurry of punches and kicks.
