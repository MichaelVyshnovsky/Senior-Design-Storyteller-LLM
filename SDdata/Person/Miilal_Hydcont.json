        "mainbody": "'''Miilal Hydcont''', also known as the '''Witch Widow''', was an [[Amn]]ian noble of the [[Rosznar]] family, as well as a member of the [[Knights of the Shield]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.",
        "Activities": "Miilal was the eldest sister of Lord [[Tobem Rosznar]] and widow of the late [[Lord Hydcont]], meaning that she controlled all the fortunes of [[House Hydcont]], the Amnian branch of [[Rosznar|House Rosznar]]. Miilal was also the unofficial ruler of the city of [[Imnescar]], which she controlled thanks to her money and personality. Miilal was also involved in the slave and poison trade.",
        "History": "Thanks to the power of the Knights, and considerable bribes, Miilal avoided most of the destruction caused by the [[Sothillisian War]] in early 1370 DR. She then got busy rebuilding her city but did not abandon her hatred of Lady [[Estrip Rosznar]] of [[Waterdeep]], hoping to regain that noble title for her branch of the family."
