        "Activities": "The cookhouse at the Whistling Wizard was a raucous place where Thamphrol and the other kitchen drudges bickered with each other and the two [[dwarven]] cooks, [[Bezoldur Thornhand]] and [[Thaunder Gallowglaive]], nonstop while carrying water, tending fires, turning spits, stirring cauldrons, and cleaning and slicing vegetables. They treated the four serving wenches who came to pick up food in much the same manner. It was a stressful working environment made even more uncomfortable by the heat from all the cooking fires and ovens. Thamphrol and his coworkers adapted by wearing very little clothing as they worked.",
