        "mainbody": "eneral Ignazar was a fire archon that long-served as an ally of the fire primordial Maegera.\nUnable to concede defeat, Ignazar never stopped his endless war â€“ he forewent conflicts on the plane of Elemental Chaos and brought forth a seemingly unending stream of elemental archons onto Toril to conquer the material world.\nTens of thousands of years before the Present Age, General Ignazar fought for Maegera during the Dawn War.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Ignazar aligned himself with the mad fire giant Gommoth, the self-styled King of Mount Hotenow and leader of the burgeoning cult of Maegera. Ignazar was granted use of the ancient dwarven stronghold of Fireguard Fortress to use as his own personal keep, to defend Gommoth and his followers as they took action to reawaken the slumbering primordial in the Prime Material plane."
