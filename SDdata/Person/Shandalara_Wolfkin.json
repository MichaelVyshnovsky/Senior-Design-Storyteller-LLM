        "mainbody": "Shandalara Wolfkin was a half-elf ranger that lived on Toril until accidentally stumbling upon a planar conduit that took her to the Colothys layer of Carceri in the 14 century DR.\nShandalara devoted much of her time in Colothys in the Land of the Hunt, the divine realm of the deity Malar. While there she would make the best of her situation by sabotaging the various dens strewn throughout the Hunt, thereby sabotaging the activities of Malar and his hunters. Because of this activity she was always being hunted, necessitating that she sleep in a different place every night.\nShe would gladly help anyone with the power to further cause destruction to the dens in the Hunt. However, after living on edge as prey for so long Shandalara was distrustful of everyone she met until they proved themselves to her."
