        "mainbody": "'''Shandalara Wolfkin''' was a [[half-elf]] [[ranger]] that lived on [[Toril]] until accidentally stumbling upon a [[planar conduit]] that took her to the [[Colothys]] layer of [[Carceri]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Shandalara devoted much of her time in Colothys in the [[Land of the Hunt]], the [[divine realm]] of the [[deity]] [[Malar]]. While there she would make the best of her situation by sabotaging the various dens strewn throughout the Hunt, thereby sabotaging the activities of Malar and his hunters. Because of this activity she was always being hunted, necessitating that she sleep in a different place every night.\n\nShe would gladly help anyone with the power to further cause destruction to the dens in the Hunt. However, after living on edge as prey for so long Shandalara was distrustful of everyone she met until they proved themselves to her."
