Samdralyrion was an old brass dragon during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR.
In 1373 DR, Samdralyrion was among the metallic dragons who wanted to find a cure for the Rage. He was a good ally of Chatulio and Karasendrieth. He decided to join a cabal of humanoid wizards in Thentia to study the Rage. However, when the avariel Taegan Nightwind and the faerie dragon Jivex arrived in the city, Samdralyrion succumbed to the Rage and started attacking the wizards. The intervention of Taegan and Jivex saved the wizards but only at the cost of the brass dragons life.
