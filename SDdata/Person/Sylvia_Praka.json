        "mainbody": "Sylvia Praka was the Baroness of Ostel in Damara in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nSylvia lived in luxury and normally executed her political opponents. In Praka, she had total control of the local landowners, but outside the walls, the population hated her.\nSylvia was not a true member of House Praka, the ruling house of Ostel. She was instead an unrelated noblewoman who was appointed to the role of baroness by Zhengyi the Witch-King. Sylvias best ally was the baron Dimian Ree of Morov.\nSylvia knew well that she was hated by her subordinates and that one day Prakas walls would not be enough. She was truly desperate, her only possibility being the crowning of Dimian as king. She claimed to worship Ilmater, but nobody believed her.\nIn the , Sylvia was a noblewoman and powerful magic-user who was appointed to the role of baroness by Zhengyi the Witch-King after he had all of House Praka assassinated during his conquest of Damara. She quickly consolidated her control over the wealthy elites of Ostel with a combination of magic and charisma, but did not bother to endear herself to the commonfolk. she sided with Baron Dimian Ree of Morov and Baron Zorth BelMaris of Polten against the forces of Bloodstone, led by then-Baron Gareth Dragonsbane. but she continued to oppose Gareth at every turn.\nFollowing Gareths ascent and Zhengyis defeat, her popularity sunk so low that her people would have gladly helped the army of Bloodstone overthrow her. However, she managed to hold onto power, and by the late 1360s DR she had gained the loyalty of thousands of her subjects, making her a political force with which to be reckoned, even for King Gareth."
