'''Boesild Aerasumé''' was a [[half-elf]] [[fighter]] and [[mage]] of [[Silverymoon]]. He was the eighth son of [[Alustriel Silverhand]]. He was known for being the most pragmatic of her [[Tall Ones|sons]].

By [[1370 DR]], Boesild was also the [[Moonstars]]' regional agent for [[Luruar]] and the [[Evermoors]] region. He was the only one of Alustriel's children who got on well with [[Khelben Arunsun]]; the rest only just endured him for the sake of their [[Alustriel Silverhand|mother]].
