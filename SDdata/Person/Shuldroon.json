        "mainbody": "'''Shuldroon''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Per [[Storm Silverhand]]'s intelligence, Shuldroon was zealous and overconfident, a killer, and was out to make his mark. Internally, he was arrogant, and believed in the superiority of War Wizard command over knights. He sneered a lot.",
        "Abilities": "Shuldroon could feel large amounts of magic being unwound, and he could wield [[wand]]s. He also knew more than one offensive spell.",
        "Possessions": "Shuldroon carried a ''[[wand of lightning bolts]]'' or similar.",
        "Relationships": "During his last mission, Shuldroon was part of a team together with [[Rondrand]] and [[Athlar]]; all squads were under the command of [[Kelgantor]]. Storm Silverhand considered [[Hondryn]] one of his flunkies.",
        "History": "Shuldroon was a part of the squad sent to capture [[Elminster Aumar]] at [[Tethgard]] after he stole the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]'' from the Royal Palace of [[Suzail]]. While approaching Elminster's refuge, his team broke formation out of unfamiliarity with the terrain. He provided some unprompted advice in the aftermath, right before they noticed the ripples in the [[Weave]] from Elminster destroying an [[enchanted]] item, and were precipitated into action.\n\nDuring their meeting with Elminster, Shuldroon ran his mouth quite freely, gloating and boasting, and even issued commands that were ignored by the rest of the team, though Kelgantor did not contest them.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|30-32|2}} He continued to gab until Elminster admitted the gorget was no more, at which point, Shuldroon immediately attacked with his strongest spell, which, combined with everyone else's spells, blew up Tethgard, slaying Kelgantor on the process. He was unmoved by the deadly counterattack of [[the Simbul]], instead employing his wand to fire off a lightning bolt; it slew a [[highknight]]. His next discharge was somehow augmented and rebounded by an unknown spell of Elminster's; it went right back to his wand, which exploded, killing him."
