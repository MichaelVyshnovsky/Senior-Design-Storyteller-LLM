        "mainbody": "Shuldroon was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nPer Storm Silverhands intelligence, Shuldroon was zealous and overconfident, a killer, and was out to make his mark. Internally, he was arrogant, and believed in the superiority of War Wizard command over knights. He sneered a lot.\nShuldroon could feel large amounts of magic being unwound, and he could wield wands. He also knew more than one offensive spell.\nShuldroon carried a wand of lightning bolts or similar.\nDuring his last mission, Shuldroon was part of a team together with Rondrand and Athlar all squads were under the command of Kelgantor. Storm Silverhand considered Hondryn one of his flunkies.\nShuldroon was a part of the squad sent to capture Elminster Aumar at Tethgard after he stole the Royal Gorget of Battle from the Royal Palace of Suzail. While approaching Elminsters refuge, his team broke formation out of unfamiliarity with the terrain. He provided some unprompted advice in the aftermath, right before they noticed the ripples in the Weave from Elminster destroying an enchanted item, and were precipitated into action.\nDuring their meeting with Elminster, Shuldroon ran his mouth quite freely, gloating and boasting, and even issued commands that were ignored by the rest of the team, though Kelgantor did not contest them. He continued to gab until Elminster admitted the gorget was no more, at which point, Shuldroon immediately attacked with his strongest spell, which, combined with everyone elses spells, blew up Tethgard, slaying Kelgantor on the process. He was unmoved by the deadly counterattack of the Simbul, instead employing his wand to fire off a lightning bolt it slew a highknight. His next discharge was somehow augmented and rebounded by an unknown spell of Elminsters it went right back to his wand, which exploded, killing him."
