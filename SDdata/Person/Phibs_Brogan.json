        "mainbody": "'''Phibs Brogan''' was a foppish patron of the [[Elfsong Tavern]] from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|What in the hells are you staring at? Have I got [[spinach]] in my teeth?|Phibs Brogan}}",
        "Description": "Phibs was a fashionably dressed [[gold dwarven]] man. He had a dusky skin tone, dark brown eyes, and black hair. He kept his head clean-shaven and gathered the trimmed beared into a tied knot.\n\nNotably, Phibs wore a red suit he purchased from [[Carm's Garm]], a clothier located on the [[Wyrm's Crossing]]. Unfortunately, that outfit made him look a lot like [[Dolor]], a [[Bhaalist]] serial killer dwarf.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Phibs Brogan was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. He attended the \"Laff Riot\" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by [[Harvard Willoughby]] in Elfsong's side room with a stage. Phibs was excited to see the show after his friend, [[Roanoke]] \"almost pissed himself laughing.\" Phibs' expectations were high as Harvard Willoughby wore a [[monocle]] and anyone wearing one was good in the dwarf's book."
