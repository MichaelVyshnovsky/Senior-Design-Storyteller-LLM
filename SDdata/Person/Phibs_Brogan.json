        "mainbody": "Phibs Brogan was a foppish patron of the Elfsong Tavern from the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nPhibs was a fashionably dressed gold dwarven man. He had a dusky skin tone, dark brown eyes, and black hair. He kept his head clean-shaven and gathered the trimmed beared into a tied knot.\nNotably, Phibs wore a red suit he purchased from Carms Garm, a clothier located on the Wyrms Crossing. Unfortunately, that outfit made him look a lot like Dolor, a Bhaalist serial killer dwarf.\nIn the , Phibs Brogan was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldurs Gate. He attended the \"Laff Riot\" show at the Elfong, a stand-up comedy performance hosted by Harvard Willoughby in Elfsongs side room with a stage. Phibs was excited to see the show after his friend, Roanoke \"almost pissed himself laughing.\" Phibs expectations were high as Harvard Willoughby wore a monocle and anyone wearing one was good in the dwarfs book."
