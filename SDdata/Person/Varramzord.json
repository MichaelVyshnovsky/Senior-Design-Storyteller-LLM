        "mainbody": "'''Varramzord''', also known as '''Varram the White''', was a male [[Gold dwarf|gold]] [[dwarf]] and the White Dragon Wyrmspeaker in the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Severin Silrajin]].",
        "Personality": "Owing to his past experience, Varram hated the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and despised the fact that Severin had allied with them.",
        "History": "Varram was captured by pirates during a trip across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and sold as a slave to the Red Wizards of Thay. He managed to escape but retained a great hate for the [[Thay]]an wizards.\n\nDuring the [[Tyranny of Dragons]], a very competent [[Zhentarim]] thief stole Varram's ''[[white dragon mask]]'' and in fear of punishment from Severin he secretly traveled from the Cult's stronghold of the [[Well of Dragons]] to the [[Tomb of Diderius]]—the site of a powerful divination pool—in order to find the mask's location. However, in the [[Serpent Hills]], Varram was captured by a [[yuan-ti]] clan.\n\nEventually an adventuring band opposed to the Cult rescued Varram in order to extract information from him."
