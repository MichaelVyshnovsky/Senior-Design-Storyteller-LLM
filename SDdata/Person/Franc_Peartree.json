        "mainbody": "'''Franc Peartree''' was a weapons dealer who worked for Lord [[Enver Gortash]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''And I do. I do love you, Franc. I love any man willing to birth a little more slithering, wet malice into the world.

        "Possessions": "Franc Peartree owned a small home in the [[Lower City]] of the Gate, near [[Felogyr's Fireworks]]. The plaque by its doors read \"The Humble Home of Franc Peartree.\"",
        "History": "Once, Franc Peartree was a cook who worked for the [[Flaming Fist]]s in the [[Basilisk Gate]]'s barracks but he was discharged after suffering an injury. Subsequently, Franc Peartree became an ambitious [[Banite]] weapons dealer in the city of Baldur's Gate. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, his name was recommended to a rising criminal of grand aspirations â€“ Lord Enver Gortash. He recently came into possession of a large quantity of [[infernal iron]], a material that created powerful weapons that needed no [[enchanted|enchantments]], and Gortash needed an ambitious seller with contacts and low morals. Peartree agreed to be Lord's distributor. He kept a detailed ledger of Gortash's weapon sales to such unsavory organizations as the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Knights of the Shield]]. In his ledger, Franc noted that the sales to the Knights began declining due to the organization's looming collapse. To compensate for that loss, Franc organizes sales to an unnamed buyer in [[Athkatla]]. Lord Gortash considered the weapon sale enterprise to be as successful as it were due to Franc Peartree's work.\n\nIn 1492 DR, when the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s threat hung over the city, Franc Peartree sold Gortash's infernal iron fire-spitters to the city of Baldur's Gate, where they were placed in various places of importance, such as the [[Wyrm's Crossing]]. The [[Murder Tribunal]] of [[Bhaal]], led by [[Orin the Red]], found the constructs distasteful. Soon after, Franc was murdered by Bhaal's cultists, while cooking soup. His abode in the Lower City, was turned into a macabre shrine to Bhaal. Franc's tombstone was commissioned to be carved by [[Candulhallow's Tombstones]] in the Lower City. His freshly-carved grave marker read: \"Our Lady's Traitor. His life now given, gladly taken.\""
