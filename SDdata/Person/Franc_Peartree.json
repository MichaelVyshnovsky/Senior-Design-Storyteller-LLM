        "mainbody": "Franc Peartree was a weapons dealer who worked for Lord Enver Gortash of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nFranc Peartree owned a small home in the Lower City of the Gate, near Felogyrs Fireworks. The plaque by its doors read \"The Humble Home of Franc Peartree.\"\nOnce, Franc Peartree was a cook who worked for the Flaming Fists in the Basilisk Gates barracks but he was discharged after suffering an injury. Subsequently, Franc Peartree became an ambitious Banite weapons dealer in the city of Baldurs Gate. Sometime before the , his name was recommended to a rising criminal of grand aspirations â€“ Lord Enver Gortash. He recently came into possession of a large quantity of infernal iron, a material that created powerful weapons that needed no enchantments, and Gortash needed an ambitious seller with contacts and low morals. Peartree agreed to be Lords distributor. He kept a detailed ledger of Gortashs weapon sales to such unsavory organizations as the Zhentarim and the Knights of the Shield. In his ledger, Franc noted that the sales to the Knights began declining due to the organizations looming collapse. To compensate for that loss, Franc organizes sales to an unnamed buyer in Athkatla. Lord Gortash considered the weapon sale enterprise to be as successful as it were due to Franc Peartrees work.\nIn 1492 DR, when the Cult of the Absolutes threat hung over the city, Franc Peartree sold Gortashs infernal iron fire-spitters to the city of Baldurs Gate, where they were placed in various places of importance, such as the Wyrms Crossing. The Murder Tribunal of Bhaal, led by Orin the Red, found the constructs distasteful. Soon after, Franc was murdered by Bhaals cultists, while cooking soup. His abode in the Lower City, was turned into a macabre shrine to Bhaal. Francs tombstone was commissioned to be carved by Candulhallows Tombstones in the Lower City. His freshly-carved grave marker read \"Our Ladys Traitor. His life now given, gladly taken.\""
