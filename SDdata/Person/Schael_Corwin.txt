'''Captain Schael Corwin''' was an officer of the [[Flaming Fist]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"Ah, noise and crowds. Feels like home."''|Corwin}}

==Personality==
Schael was quite a free spirit in her younger years and tested her father's composure and emotional fortitude. Her exploits even got her into trouble with the soldiers whose ranks she would later join.

As an adult, she could readily be described as a no-nonsense individual. She was extremely dutiful and devoted her life to her family and the Fist.

She enjoyed [[Berduskan Dark]] wine.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|15}}

==Possessions==
Schael owned a [[Corwin's armor|unique set]] of [[chainmail]] that was custom-made to fit her form. Schael's father gifted it to her when she gained admission into the Flaming Fist.

She wielded an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] ''[[Corwin's bow|composite longbow]]'' that could ''[[entangle]]'' any foe she struck with an [[arrow]].

==Relationships==
Schael followed the path taken by her father [[Audamar Corwin|Audamar]], who was also a soldier of the Flaming Fist.

Schael had a tumultuous relationship with Rhoma's father, [[Beno Famari]]. Over the course of their knowing one another she had killed him on at least five separate occasions.

For a short while she worked alongside an [[elven]] [[wizard]] named [[Zeri]].

==History==
After she joined the Flaming Fist, Corwin ascended through the ranks rather quickly. She eventually attained the rank of captain.

When the [[War of the Shining Crusade]] broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Captain Corwin was assigned to accompany the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]] as he rallied his old adventuring party and prepared to accompany the [[Flaming Fist]] north to rally with the rest of the [[Coalition]] forces.
