        "mainbody": "Blackrabbas Khuulthund was a Tethyrian sage inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe had a reputation for being a pompous individual who enjoyed the sound of his own voice and praising himself. This caused his reputation as a sage to suffer.\nBlackrabbas Khuulthund studied the birds, insects, herbs, and flowers of the Sword Coast and northwest Faer√ªn. He spent much of his time within the Font of Knowledge in the Castle Ward and rented a house nearby."
