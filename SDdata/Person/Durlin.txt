'''Durlin''' was the last brewmaster of [[Myth Drannor]] who perished during the [[Weeping War]] and whose [[ghost]]ly apparition could be seen and heard haunting the places he loved in life.

==Possessions==
Durlin left behind a few items that belonged to him, he hid his pair of ''[[gloves of courage]]'' in a barrel in the room he used to play chess at, and his favorite weapon, the ''[[brewmaster's cudgel]]'' was used by one of the lizardfolk that found in the Dungeons' ruins.

==History==
As the brewmaster, Durlin was maintaining the Shrine of Hanseath in the [[Halls of Light]] and was in charge of the city's sacred brewery. His tireless work could still be witnessed all across many levels of the Dwarven Dungeons centuries after his death. Many [[cask]]s of his holy brews still possessed their magical properties even as late as [[1369 DR]]. In life, Durlin spent countless hours playing [[Chess (game)|Chess]] with his best friend [[Drake (person)|Drake]] in the Halls of Light's Chess Room.

In [[1369 DR]] his ghost helped the heroes from [[Phlan]] who arrived at Myth Drannor to oppose the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s evil plan. Durlin guided them to his hidden magic items in the Halls of Light.
