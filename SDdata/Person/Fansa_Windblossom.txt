'''Fansa Windblossom''' was one of the four Cloakmasters of [[Eshpurta]] for the [[Shadow Thieves]] around [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Fansa was abandoned by her elven mother and grew up with a pair of married rangers. One day, however, she tired of their preachings and killed them and stole all their valuables, which she sold. With the money, she enrolled in a wizard school.

Later, she joined the Shadow Thieves, where she rose to the status of Cloakmaster.

She was once seriously scarred fighting a mad [[efreeti]].

==Personality==
Fansa was very self-reliant and expected that all her underlings acted the same. She had only a minimal relationship with other local Cloakmasters.
