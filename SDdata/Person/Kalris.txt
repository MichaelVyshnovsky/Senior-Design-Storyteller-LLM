'''Kalris''' was a [[human]] [[adventurer]] and member of the [[Emerald Swords]] company ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. He was a [[wizard]] of some quality, and handled most of the group's spellcasting.

==Description==
Kalris had long, red hair.

==Personality==
He was a cunning and opportunistic man, preferring stealth and misdirection over direct action.

==Abilities==
Kalris was a proficient [[Arcane magic|arcane spellcaster]], and had a wide variety of spells at his disposal. They tended towards subtle spells that aided his subterfuges.

==Possessions==
Kalris carried a [[dagger]] and a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]''. He wore a ''[[robe of the archmagi]]'', a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', and a ''[[ring of form retention]]''.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Kalris and the Emerald Swords were guests at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. They conspired to kidnap Lord [[Partic Thistle]] and hand him over to [[Zhentil Keep]] for questioning, and had [[Xixis]] the [[doppelganger]] impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. To aid the deception, Kalris lent Xixis his ''ring of form retention'', to make absolutely sure that the doppelganger didn't lose its disguise. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, [[Gandegar Armstrong]] had [[Haridyn Storm]] kill Xixis with a ''dagger of venom'', so that the Lord's murder would cover up his kidnapping. Thanks to the ''ring of form retention'', Xixis kept the form of Lord Thistle even in death. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.
