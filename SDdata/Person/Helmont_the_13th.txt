'''Helmont the 13th''' was the twentieth duke of the [[Duchy of Carmathan]] in the Kingdom of [[Damara]]. His reign ended during the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]] at the end of the [[Vaasan War]].

==Relationships==
Helmont the 13th was a member of the noble house of [[Devlin (family)|Devlin]]. His successor, [[Dashard Devlin]], was his fourth cousin.

==History==
When [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] completed his [[Vaasan War|decade-long invasion of Damara]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, by slaying King [[Virdin Bloodfeathers]] at the [[Ford of Goliad]], he and his allies set in motion a plan to wipe out the remaining ruling nobles and replace them with puppets. Helmont the 13th was the first of Damara's dukes to be assassinated, followed by fifty members of his family. This left Dashard Devlin, an ally of Zhengyi, as the only viable claimant to the ducal seat. Dashard was swiftly appointed as Duke Helmont the 14th, ushering in an era of propaganda and subjugation in Carmathan.
