Helmont the 13th was the twentieth duke of the Duchy of Carmathan in the Kingdom of Damara. His reign ended during the mid&ndash14 century DR at the end of the Vaasan War.
Helmont the 13th was a member of the noble house of Devlin. His successor, Dashard Devlin, was his fourth cousin.
When Zhengyi the Witch-King completed his decade-long invasion of Damara in the , by slaying King Virdin Bloodfeathers at the Ford of Goliad, he and his allies set in motion a plan to wipe out the remaining ruling nobles and replace them with puppets. Helmont the 13th was the first of Damaras dukes to be assassinated, followed by fifty members of his family. This left Dashard Devlin, an ally of Zhengyi, as the only viable claimant to the ducal seat. Dashard was swiftly appointed as Duke Helmont the 14th, ushering in an era of propaganda and subjugation in Carmathan.
