        "mainbody": "'''Falataer''' was a powerful [[bard]], musician, and instrument maker from the [[Moonshae Isles]], famed for creating the original ''[[Instruments of the Bards]]'' of [[Toril]].",
        "History": "Long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Falataer was known as a wise teacher and a bard of impressive powers. He ran a bardic college on the Moonshae Isles and tested his students with the ''Instruments of the Bards'', later gifting them to his best students. Over the centuries, Falataer's designs were copied, and the instrument retained the great bard's name as a sign of respect.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, it was believed that there were only about twenty ''[[Falataeric Cli lyre]]s'' left in existence, at least those exquisite lyres that were hand-crafted by the great bard in his workshop back on the Moonshae Isles. One of these instruments was sold at the [[Chromatic Scale]], a musical instrument shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
