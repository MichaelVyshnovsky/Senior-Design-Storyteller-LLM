'''Uzad al-Aqnadi''' was a [[holy slayer]] of the [[Flamedeath Fellowship]] who was in charge of internal security at [[Krak al-Niraan]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Like most holy slayers, Uzad was a fanatic. He believed his service at Krak al-Niraan would spread the influence of [[Kossuth]] throughout [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
Uzad was a master of his chosen weaponâ€”the ''[[tufenk]]'', and skilled in the use of [[liquid star]].

==Possessions==
Uzad's ''tufenk'' was custom-fitted with a [[firestarter]]. Uzad also owned a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'', a magical [[scimitar]], some ''[[bracers of defense]]'', and always carried several [[smoke sphere]]s and [[star pot]]s.
