Kaa Mihnd was an inhabitant of a poor fishing village somewhere and sometime.
According to an unconfirmed account by Kaa Mihnd, falling stars crashed into the village square one night, and the villagers used these to forge the magical katanas known as Divine Fury. Kaa Mihnd and the other villagers used these swords to rise up against their rich overlord and reclaim their ancestral land.
