Rildra was a Harper in Scornubel during the mid-14 century DR.
She was a very vicious fighter.
Rildra was part of Harper activities in or around Scornubel.
The Harper was known to Marlel and to Ulburt.
In late , Marlel tried to talk to Rildra while guiding Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith through Scornubel. He asked Ulburt to refer them to her, but Ulburt said Rildra had been slain fighting Red Wizards, killing one and hurting his bodyguard while armed with nothing but a hairpin.
