'''Horlo Aumrabbar''' was a member of the adventuring band known as the [[Company of the Cloak]].

==Activities==
He was the soft-spoken deceiver within the band. A worshiper of [[Mask]], he influenced [[Mhair Gulzrabban]] to act in a more subtle and patient manner. After setting up several caches of wealth throughout the [[Western Heartlands]], Horlo planned several means of betraying Mhair and his lover [[Sharaera Duthtue|Sharaera]] should they ever act too boldly for his taste. One of his plans involved the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].

==Abilities==
Along with all of the other members of the Company of the Cloak, Horlo possessed an immunity to [[oil of taggit]] (which caused unconsciousness).

==Possessions==
Horlo wielded a ''[[keen]] [[longsword]]'' and possessed a ''[[candle of truth]]'' and a ''[[chime of opening]]''.
