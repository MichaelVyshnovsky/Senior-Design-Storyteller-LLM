        "mainbody": "Erelda Htithet was the main drow representative in Mantol-Derith.\nEreda was very good at concealing her scorn for others. She lived in fear of Talabrina Duskryn and did anything she said. However, Erelda personally thought she could do good business with the deep gnomes.\nErelda usually sold art objects, poisons, and obsidian daggers, in exchange for salt and gems.\nIn 1479 DR, Erelda was, following the suggestion of Talabrina Duskryn, the main opponent to re-opening the outpost to the deep gnomes of Blingdenstone."
