        "mainbody": "'''Zaaman Rul''', called the '''Prince of Good Fire Creatures''', the '''Flame of Purity''', and the '''Resilient Ember''', was the good [[archomental]] of fire in the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], and thus the archenemy of his evil counterpart [[Imix]]. His symbols were a longsword of fire and an orange Z.\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "He took the form of a {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes|adj=tall}}, {{SIAdj|400|lb|k}} humanoid with red skin that resembled burning coal, long black hair, and black eyes that held kindness despite his fearsome visage.",
        "Personality": "He was honorable and courageously stood against evil, though many considered him na√Øve and inexperienced as the newest of the archomentals. He was thoughtful and diplomatic, but had little patience for people who lacked tact, honesty, or etiquette, and was as much a creature of action as of communication. The Resilient Ember was enthusiastic in everything he did.",
        "Abilities": "As an archomental, Zaaman Rul possessed a long list of powers and abilities. He possessed [[darkvision]], as much good as it did a being of fire, and naturally spoke the languages of [[Celestial language|Celestial]] and [[Ignan]], and could use a ''[[tongues]]''-like ability to speak to and understand any creature intelligent enough to speak. He himself was a genius with great knowledge of diplomacy, healing, magic, and matters of the planes; he was fast, agile, and perceptive, and a terrifyingly skilled warrior.\n\nZaaman Rul was immune to damage caused by fire and heat, obviously, as well as poison, sleep-inducing effects, paralyzation, petrification, and stunning. He was resistant to both spells and physical damage- and could not even be injured by weapons with less than a moderately strong enchantment; he also healed quickly, and any metal weapon that struck him risked melting on contact. However, he was vulnerable to damage caused by water or ice.\n\nBy his touch alone, Zaaman Rul set any and all combustible objects and materials on fire, and any creature that came too close to him in combat risked catching on fire, as did any creature he struck with his sword. Moreover, Zaaman Rul could extinguish any nonmagical, open flames within {{SI|20|ft}} of him, and could dispel magical fire with a touch.\n\nLike other archomentals, Zaaman Rul could shapechange into any creature of his elemental subtype at will, could innately command any [[fire elemental]]s within {{SI|100|ft}} of him, and could use the spell-like abilities ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[greater dispel magic]]'', ''[[greater teleport]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', and ''[[telekinesis]]'' at will.<ref>{{Cite dragon/353/Princes of Elemental Good|43-44}} In a more fiery vein, he could also use as spell-like abilities ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[heat metal]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', and ''[[scorching ray]]'' at will; ''[[fireball]]'', quickened ''scorching ray'', ''[[flame arrows]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]'' thrice each day; and ''[[flame strike]]'' once per day.\n\nAnd lastly, he could summon and dismiss his sword at will, and once each day could summon up to three elder fire elementals, thirty [[azer]], twelve [[fire mephit]]s, five [[rast]]s, one [[fire monolith]], two fire elementals, or four [[firetail]]s.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Realm": "After his great defeat, he enlisted a clan of azer to build him a fortress, the [[Hidden Heart]]. This fortress, made of [[basalt]] and [[fyrite]], was secured behind powerful wards against divination magic and a moat of sanctified fire capable of burning any evil creatures, even those otherwise immune."
        },
        "Activities": "Zaaman Rul spent his time watching and learning, rebuilding his forces, gathering alliances and helping potential allies, and planning for when he next fought to bring down Imix.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Enemies": "Of all the good archomental, Zaaman Rul was forced to contend with the most enemies: not only did his archenemy Imix largely dominate the Plane of Fire, but he also faced opposition from the [[efreeti]] of the [[City of Brass]], and forays of minions of [[Mephistopheles]] (archdevil and lord of hellfire) and [[Gazra (archomental)|Gazra]] (supposed archomental of Ash) into his plane.",
            "Allies": "Zaaman Rul remained in contact with the [[phoenix]] that had healed him after his first, disastrous attempt to take down Imix, and it had also promised him its aid, including a large army of [[phoera]]s and [[phoelarch]]s, when he next confronted the Prince of Evil Fire. He had also allied with the great [[brass dragon]] [[Ronothere]], who had ties to the [[Court of Stars]]; the azer king [[Amaimon]]; and the celestial paragon [[Raziel]].",
            "Servitors": "Zaaman Rul was served directly by various elemental fire creatures, but given the scarcity of goodly fire creatures on his home plane, he accepted as servitors and allies various other creatures. Through his alliance with Ronothere, several squads of [[monadic deva]]s and a host of [[firre]] and [[asura]]s had entered his service. [[Fire genasi]], [[fire weird]]s, and [[sun giant]]s were also known to swear to him, and on the Material plane, a military order of [[sollux]] called the [[Sun Brothers]] had pledged their loyalty to the Flame of Purity.\n\nHis dual role as both a crusading rebel prince and freedom fighter against the tyrannical Imix was an inspiration to others across the planes as they fought for their own causes."
        },
        "History": "Zaaman Rul was said to have once been a (mostly) ordinary fire elemental, who rose to power and spent years gathering a great army of azer, firetails, fire mephits, fire elementals, and renegade efreet with which to challenge Imix. He gathered his forces on the [[Plain of Burnt Dreams]], where it was said a great artifact of good was located, and attacked his sire when the time was right. The battle was long and fierce, but ultimately the older, smarter Imix prevailed, destroying much of the goodly forces and grievously wounding Zaaman Rul. The artifact, if it existed, was lost beneath the waves of the [[Burning Sea]].\n\nZaaman Rul, defeated and left for dead, contemplated giving up and surrendering the Plane of Fire to Imix. But a [[phoenix]] appeared to him, restored his body and mind, and gave him newfound hope. Though he was forced to go into hiding, he learned from his defeat and began planning Imix's downfall anew."
