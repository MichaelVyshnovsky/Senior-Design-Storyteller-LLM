'''Erik Sliphand''', also known as the '''Rogue of [[Turmish]]''', was an ancient decorated hero of [[Myth Drannor]] who died before the advent of the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Erik's most notable possession was his unique [[enchanted]] [[leather armor]] called the ''[[armor of shadows]]'', which served him in life and was buried with its owner in death.

==History==
Erik Sliphand, who lived in ancient Myth Drannor after leaving Turmish, died many centuries before his grave was disturbed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their [[drow]] allies in [[1369 DR]]. Erik's body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside Magister [[Luther]], [[Arianna]], [[Sindar]], [[Bannoc]], and [[Shyla]]. Their final resting places were corrupted by the wild magics of the [[Weeping War]]. The Rogue of Turmish and his crypt-mates became cursed with the [[undead]] existence as [[wraith]]s, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with.
