Topaz was a blue jay that nested in the Emerald Grove during the late 15 century DR.
He had predominantly blue feathers, with a white breast and legs, and a line of black running along the sides of his neck.
Topaz was a discerning bird who was quite concerned with the specific arrangement of his nest. He wanted exactly the right items placed in exact perfect positions within.
Among the items found within Topaz next were a bundle of straw, a magnifying glass, a single gold coin and a unique key.
