Jaras Silverblood was a Huntmaster of Malar, and the leader of the Company of the Hunt, a group of outlaw-worshipers of the Beastlord from the Winterwood, during the late 14-century DR. He was known for his particularly calculating, and overbearing nature.
Jaras was wanted in Turmish for the murder of an assemblyman.
Among Jaras possessions were a helm of brilliance and a pair of gauntlets of ogre power. He also always kept several vials of poison on his person.
