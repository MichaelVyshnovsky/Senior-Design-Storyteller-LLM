        "mainbody": "'''Menes Azludde''' was the lead [[priest]] of [[Cyric]] in [[Skullport]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Menes was handsome and charismatic, but also scheming and very ambitious. His goal was to rule not only Skullport, but [[Waterdeep]] and after the whole [[North]].",
        "Activities": "While he led his faithful in preaching and finding converts, Menes also worked to build his small cult into a criminal enterprise similar to the local [[skulker gang]]s of Skullport. At the same time, he sought to undermine the Shadow Port's balance of power and amass more influence for himself, an ambition that seemed likely to be beyond his capabilities.",
        "History": "Beginning with his arrival in Skullport in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Menes plotted to turn the devotion of the people of Skullport to the Black Sun. Under his leadership, the [[church of Cyric]] swiftly rose to become one of the forces to be reckoned with in the town, albeit a minor one.\n\nAs he amassed followers, he began to set in motion a complex plan involving dozens of beings working independently, seemingly on unrelated tasks, all meant collectively to sow chaos and undermine Skullport's power structures. His aim was to cause people to lose faith in the status quo, and ultimately to look to the church of Cyric for stability. By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Menes's plans had attracted the ire of most other major players in the Shadow Port, including the [[Agents of the Eye]], the [[Dark Dagger]], the [[Harpers]], the [[Iron Ring]], the [[Keepers]], and, most unfortunately, the [[Skulls of Skullport]]."
