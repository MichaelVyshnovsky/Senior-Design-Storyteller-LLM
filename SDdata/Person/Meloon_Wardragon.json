        "mainbody": "'''Meloon Wardragon''' ({{Pronounce|may|LOON|refs=}}) was a [[human]] [[mercenary|sellsword]] active in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Meloon was a very tall young man with broad shoulders, blond hair, and pale blond scruff on his face. He carried a tattoo of the [[Wardragon]] family crest, which was a serpentine dragon wrapped vertically around a downward-pointing sword.",
        "History": "Meloon traveled to Waterdeep around [[1477 DR]]. He may have previously lived in [[Loudwater]]. At the [[Mysticslake]] tavern in Waterdeep, he was once pickpocketed but won the fight that resulted.\n\nIn [[Nightal]] [[1479 DR]], Meloon was working as a hired blade in [[Waterdeep]] when [[Laraelra Harsard]] hired him as a bodyguard to accompany her into the sewers to rescue a trapped [[dwarf|dwarven]] worker. While in the sewers, they heard a woman's screams and were able to use Laraelra's knowledge of the tunnel system to determine which house the screams came from. They contacted the house's owner, [[Renaer Neverember]], who with his friends escorted Meloon and Laraelra to the house. They eventually rescued the future [[Blackstaff]], [[Vajra Safahr]], from imprisonment and torture by [[Khondar Naomal|Khondar \"Ten-Rings\" Naomal]], who desired to have the power of the Blackstaff for himself.\n \nThe group was forced to flee Waterdeep to a [[Neverember]] mansion outside the city after Khondar framed Renaer for Vajra's murder. Before returning to Waterdeep, the companions traveled through a gate to [[Pellamcopse Woods]], where they were taken by the [[Nameless Haunt]] to his lair. At the Nameless Haunt's abode, Meloon was shown a magical axe, ''[[Azuredge]]'', stuck in a tree stump. Only Meloon was able to pull the axe from the stump. Meloon had a vision in which he spoke with his ancestor [[Laroun]] and pledged himself to the defense of Waterdeep.\n\nMeloon later used his axe to attack Khondar at [[Roarke House]] in Waterdeep. Khondar managed to get hold of the axe, which was one of the keys that disabled the wards around Ahghairon's Tower. Meloon was determined to get the axe back, however, and helped Vajra defeat Khondar.\n\nAfter Vajra assumed the role of the seventh Blackstaff and killed Khondar, Meloon became one of the members of Renaer's organization intended to replace the [[Moonstars]] as defenders of Waterdeep and the Blackstaff.\n\nMeloon as member of the new [[Force Grey]] helped adventurers in tough situations.\n\nHowever, around [[1491 DR]], during an expedition to [[Undermountain]] with an adventuring party, they were attacked by the [[Xanathar]]'s minions and an [[intellect devourer]] ate Meloon's brain. He returned to Waterdeep as a spy of the [[mind flayer]] [[Nihiloor]]. Under orders from his new masters, Meloon discouraged adventurers from going into Undermountain and he hunted and killed any [[Zhentarim]] agents he could find.",
        "Equipment": "Meloon wielded a double-bladed [[greataxe]] and wore leather armor. He also carried [[dagger]]s about his person, although he rarely used them.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Meloon obtained the fabled axe ''[[Azuredge]],'' a powerful relic forged by [[Ahghairon]] himself for Waterdeep's defense. Meloon was able to communicate telepathically with the sentient axe.",
        "Relationships": "Meloon was a member of the [[Clan Wardragon|Wardragon]] clan, which had been some of the early settlers of Waterdeep. Meloon was a descent of [[Laroun]], one of the early warlords of Waterdeep."
