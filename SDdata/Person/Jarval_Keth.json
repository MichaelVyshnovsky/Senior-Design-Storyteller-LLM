        "mainbody": "Jarval Keth was a Mulan   explorer. He discovered the symbol marking the entrance to the hidden Imaskari level in Maskana.  \nAfter finding an unusual version of the crescent and the fox pictographs in Maskana, Jarval researched these symbols at Gheldaneth, first asking around in the temples, and then in the Great University.   Jarval had barely managed to escape Sithena Tinzon, Tyarals chief inquisitor, by boarding a ship.\nJarval managed to blurt out a few clues to some adventurers before Sithena Tinzon found him. He mightve survived the fight that almost certainly ensued if so, only a heal spell couldve cured the mental sequels of his torture.   Should those adventurers have defeated Tyaral at Maskana, he was likely to have hired them to explore the lower levels of the ruin."
