When the circus was attacked by minotaur warriors from Calimport, Shan and her twin traveled with Cephas and Corvus Nightfeather to Almraiven.  Cynda was abducted in Almraiven by two Firesoul genasi and teleported to Calimport where she was forced to fight in the arena. Shan traveled with Corvus and Cephas to Calimport where Cephas was reunited with his father the Pasha but Shan was sent to the gladiator stables. The Pasha scheduled a fight between Shan and Cynda and made it the main event.  Immediately prior to the twins fight, Cephas tampered with the magic that levitated the Pashas palace and caused it to collide with the arena.  In the confusion that followed, Shan and Cynda and friends were able to escape Calimport."
