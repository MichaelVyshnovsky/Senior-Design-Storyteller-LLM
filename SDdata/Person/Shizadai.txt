Shizadai was a samurai retainer of the Michimori clan in Maeshi Province in 1360 DR.
Shizadai was ordered, together with his older brother Shizuoka, to lead a company of bushi to assist an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to retrieve the Seven Swords. He may have helped them battle Korimori clan troops led by Sakigahara and Himeji.
