'''Shizadai''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Michimori clan]] in [[Maeshi Province]] in [[1360 DR]].

==History==
Shizadai was ordered, together with his older brother [[Shizuoka]], to lead a company of [[bushi]] to assist an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to retrieve the [[Seven Swords]]. He may have helped them battle [[Korimori clan]] troops led by [[Sakigahara]] and [[Himeji]].
