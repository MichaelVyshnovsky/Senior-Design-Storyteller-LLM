Mighty Groznek was a hagspawn warrior who was imprisoned in the jail of Mulsantir in the late 14 century DR.
Groznek was a strong, muscled, brutish man of some girth. He had grey hide, red eyes, long brown hair, and notable tusks. He held spiritual beliefs typical for Rashemen – Groznek venerated spirits he believed to be everywhere – in the rocks, in the grass, in the water of the land.
Mighty Groznek was the name the orc gained in battle. Because of his hag parentage, Groznek was considered to be an abomination, unworthy of existing. He existed as an outcast. In the , while in Mulsantir, three people taunted Groznek into a berserker rage. The warriors sword swiftly ended all three lives, landing the hagspawn in prison. Soon after, the adventurer known as the Knight-Commander, or Kalach-Cha, roused the spirits of Rashemen. Soon after the Knight-Commanders arrival to Mulsantir, an army of spirits, telthors led by the Bear-God Okku, gathered outside and demanded the life of the Knight-Commander. The adventurer approached Tirzah the Old, the witch-warden of Mulsantirs jail was to help find allies, willing or unwilling, who would stand beside the Knight-Commander against angry spirits. Tirzah insisted that hagspawn named Gannayev-of-Dreams, Mighty Groznek, and hin Joeb the Cutpurse were not to be trusted. When the offer of freedom was extended to the orc, Groznek declined despite being a fierce warrior. He refused to raise a weapon against telthors – their memories and influence were great. And Groznek looked forward to achieving peace that the execution would bring.
