==Description==
Groznek was a strong, muscled, brutish man of some girth. He had grey hide, red eyes, long brown hair, and notable tusks. He held spiritual beliefs typical for [[Rashemen]] – Groznek venerated spirits he believed to be everywhere – in the rocks, in the grass, in the water of the land.

==History==
Mighty Groznek was the name the orc gained in battle. Because of his [[hag]] parentage, Groznek was considered to be an abomination, unworthy of existing. He existed as an outcast. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, while in Mulsantir, three people taunted Groznek into a berserker rage. The warrior's sword swiftly ended all three lives, landing the hagspawn in prison. Soon after, the adventurer known as the Knight-Commander, or [[Kalach-Cha]], roused the spirits of [[Rashemen]]. Soon after the Knight-Commander's arrival to Mulsantir, an army of spirits, ''[[telthor]]s'' led by the Bear-God [[Okku]], gathered outside and demanded the life of the Knight-Commander. The adventurer approached [[Tirzah the Old]], the witch-warden of Mulsantir's jail was to help find allies, willing or unwilling, who would stand beside the Knight-Commander against angry spirits. Tirzah insisted that [[hagspawn]] named [[Gannayev-of-Dreams]], Mighty Groznek, and [[hin]] [[Joeb the Cutpurse]] were not to be trusted. When the offer of freedom was extended to the orc, Groznek declined despite being a fierce warrior. He refused to raise a weapon against ''telthors'' – their memories and influence were great. And Groznek looked forward to achieving peace that the execution would bring.
