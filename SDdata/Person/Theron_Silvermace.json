        "mainbody": "'''''Theron Silvermace''''' was a life-long adventurer and explorer of the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]], a [[Harper]], and a member of the [[Silvermace]] noble family of [[Cormyr]].\n\n{{quote|''No matter what or who stands in your way, Artus, you must struggle on. The thing you seek must be found, then turned to good. Beware the goblins and the [[dinosaur]]s - the giant lizards the locals call [[Ubtao]]'s Children. They are the greatest dangers you will face.''|Theron Silvermace}}",
        "Description": "At the age of fifty, Theron looked much older than other men his age. Rugged by stress, danger, and suffering, Silvermace looked almost corpse-like, with long white hair and circles around the eyes. His skin was loose, and he had a scar on the bridge of his nose and eviscerated ear, the souvenirs from his time in Chult.",
        "Abilities": "Silvermace was a skilled painter, as evident by a stunningly realistic self-portrait he had in his home in Suzail.",
        "Possessions": "Theron Silvermace accumulated a collection of exotic artifacts from across the world he kept in his sprawling mansion in Suzail. He had a [[mummy]] in its glass sarcophagus, many various [[polearm]]s and shields decorated his home's walls, and a [[jewel]]ed stature of a mysterious woman with fangs. The statue was depicting an unknown entity, and sages theorized that it was an ancient, long-forgotten demigod. It possessed strange magic that kept it coated in light even when the rest of the room was in deep darkness. The artifact was the only one in Theron's collection that he refused to sell for any amount of [[coin]].",
        "Relationships": "Theron Silvermace's loyal friend and ally was [[Kwee Chan Sen]] who fled his home to avoid being executed in [[Shou Lung]] and, for the last four years of explorer's life, lived alongside Theron in his sprawling home.",
        "History": "Theron Silvermace had a long and respectable career of adventuring.\n\nLater in his career, he was captured and experienced unspeakable horrors in prisons of [[Menzoberranzan]]. That experience left him mentally damaged and traumatized, something that was the source of contempt and amusement among the younger generation of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers. One such young condescending, and empathy-less youth was [[Ariast]] who boldly gossiped about the man's suffering and made fun of him to [[Artus Cimber]]'s face.\n\nOn Marpenoth 5{{th}}, [[1357 DR]], Theron Silvermace was present at the trial of [[Kaverin Ebonhand]] of the [[Cult of the Frost]]. Representing [[Harpers]], Theron was there to oversee Artus Cimber in hopes of convincing the young man to rejoin his organization. During the conviction, Theron witnessed Kaverin's hands being cut off as the punishment for murder and the creation of his infamous magical black stone [[prosthetic]]s.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], Theron ventured into the [[Hordelands]], to the east from Cormyr. There he met Kwee Chan Sen, a [[Shou]] warrior who fled home and was given the new one in the Silvermace manor when they returned to Suzail together.\n\nSometime in [[1362 DR]], Theron Silvermace, joined by a fellow Stalwart [[Sigerth]], ventured on the expedition to the dangerous jungles of [[Chult]] in search of [[Mezro]], the ancient city believed to be ruined and lost to time. There, he was based from [[Port Castigliar]] and befriended a fellow Harper and the local general store owner, [[Ibn Engaruka]]. Five days into the jungles, Theron's expedition started suffering losses. The heat of the jungles killed two of the hired bearers and Sigerth. At night, they were ambushed by the cruel and cannibalistic [[Batiri]] [[goblins]]. The guides were certain that the expedition was at a safe distance from the Batiri territory, but that obviously was a false notion. Theron and other surviving members were captured and tortured, being devoured by the goblins one adventurer at a time. Silvermace found himself sharing his tortures in the underground prisons with the young [[bara]] of Mezro, [[Negus Kwalu]]. Theron and Kwalu were kept live and were to be sacrificed to the Batiri \"god\", [[Grumog]].\n\nLuckily for the adventurer, he and Kwalu Were rescued from the cannibals. The rescuer was [[Dhalmass Rayburton]], the Society of Stalwart Adventurers' founder, thought to be dead for a thousand years. The rescuer arrived in a bizarre of snow and ice, an unnatural occurrence in Chult. Silvermace concluded that Dhalmass Rayburton was kept alive by the fabled ''[[Ring of Winter]]''. Suffering through mind haze, confusion, and being lost and disoriented, the adventurer eventually returned to Port Castigliar.\n\nBack in Suzail, the surviving adventurer told of his failed expedition to Artus Cimber. Theron wanted Artus to contact Harpers to help with the quest, and likely danger posed by the Cult of Frost on the same path, the request Artus shut down. Soon after Artus' departure, the Cult's threat materialized. An [[ice golem]] assassin who was the eyes, ears, and blade of Kaverin Ebonhand, murdered the older adventurer and Kwee Chan Sen to keep the possible location of the ''Ring of Winter'' secret."
