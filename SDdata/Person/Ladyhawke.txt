Contessa '''Conchita Maria Martina Delores DeFalco''', more commonly known as Dame '''Ladyhawke''' was an adventuring knight of the [[Golden Rooster]] order from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ladyhawke was known as a feisty young woman.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Ladyhawke was named in the popular [[broadsheet]] called the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'', in the column ran by [[Jacinth "Jackie" Moonspring]], the newspaper's Society Editor. Jackie romantically connected the lady knight to an infamous womanizer and fellow Knights of the Golden Rooster member. [[Don Juan Montery]] was said to had been seen consorting several other women all within a single month, but he set his sights on Ladyhawke. Jackie Moonspring also noted that it was unknown if Don Juan and Ladyhawke would ever get close as the man was an infantry member, while Ladyhawke served as a city walls guardswoman.

In [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}{{LCRB}}, Leyland - Nightstalker wedding took place. Dame [[Jenilynn Leyland]], a [[Knight]] of the [[Right Hand of Tyr]], and Sir [[Sarren Nightstalker]], a [[Knight of the Griffon]], were united in a social gala that was reported on the pages of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]''. Ladyhawke was one of the attendants to the bride, alongside Lady [[Dominique Thorin]] and Squire [[Selphiras Elvenstar]]. It was reported that the wedding was scheduled for an earlier date, but Jenilynn Leyland was delayed due to her mission to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and being transformed into a [[Unicorn]].
