'''Wysdor''' was the [[Gnome|gnomish]] captain of the [[Gnomish sidewheeler|dreadnaught]] [[Unquenchable (spelljammer)|''Unquenchable'']].

==Relationships==
Wysdor's brother was named [[Horvath]] and served as navigator aboard his ship.

==History==
Decades before [[1361 DR]], a group of Tinker gnomes set out from [[Krynn]] to explore the reaches of [[wildspace]]. In another [[crystal sphere]], they had encountered [[neogi]] and were so distraught from the encounter that they returned to their own sphere and planet. Their vessel crash landed on Krynn, leaving only a small number of survivors. These survivors included Wysdor and his brother Horvath. These gnomes oversaw the design and construction of a second [[spelljammer]] to replace the one that they had lost. This ship was the ''Unquenchable''.

In 1361, Wysdor took on three gnomish admirals and a young [[human]] named [[Teldin Moore]]. The plan was to sail through wildspace to a planet called Devin, but before setting off from orbit around Krynn, Wysdor ordered his brother to lead a small team to examine the exterior of the sidewheeler for damage from an earlier battle. Teldin accompanied the four gnomes on this short excursion.

However, the sidewheeler was separated from its longboat when pirates unexpectedly attacked, and the fate of Wysdor and his dreadnaught are unknown.
