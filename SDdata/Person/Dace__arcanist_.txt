'''Dace''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who developed several language-based [[spell]]s.

==Personality==
This [[mentalist]] was devoted to the goddess of [[magic]], [[Mystryl]]. He considered revering Mystryl to be the most important thing to him.

==Relationships==
The [[archwizard]]s of [[Netheril]] saw Dace as not much more than an arcanist who should have been a [[priest]]. As many arcanists at the time considered themselves to be just below the gods, they frowned upon Dace's reverence.

==History==
Dace was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1962|NY}}. In {{YearlinkConvert|1995|NY}}, Dace came up with the spell that would become known as ''[[comprehend languages]]''. After developing ''[[ventriloquism]]'' and ''[[tongues]]'', the arcanist invented the ''[[taunt]]'' spell. Dace attempted to discover a means of [[magic]]al life extension and sought out [[potion]]s to do so. However, archwizards of Netheril would plot to end Dace's life as they didn't share his utmost devotion to Mystryl. After Dace finally discovered a ''[[potion of longevity]]'', these rival arcanists ordered the potion to be [[curse]]d. After becoming far older by imbibing the cursed potion, he finally died in {{YearlinkConvert|2083|NY}}.
