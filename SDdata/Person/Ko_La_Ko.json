        "mainbody": "Ko La Ko was a promising young wu jen of the mercantile Ko clan of Shou Lung around .\nSensing his talent, his grandfather the great wu jen Ko Ho San took him on as apprentice and together they investigated the Black Leopard Cult. Together with some adventurers hired by Ko Ho San, he went to search for information in Hsin-to, at the mouth of the Fenghsintzu River in Tu Lung.\nDuring the journey, they met Hu Sen on Mad Monkey Island, who offered to teach them his own martial art, Mad Monkey.\nIn Tu Lung, they fought and defeated the demon known as the Dragon Claw. It was possible that, if Hu Sen appeared and offer to take them on as his monk disciples in the art of the Mad Monkey, Ko La Ko would readily accept, becoming a monk and departing off on adventures with his new master.\nKo La Ko was a kindly individual who had not yet shown his true potential. He was unsuited to merchant life."
