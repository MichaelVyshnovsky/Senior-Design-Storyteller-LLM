'''Tharra''' was a [[Harper]] spy.


==History==
Tharra hailed from [[Mistledale]] but her job with Harpers made her travel a lot.

In [[1479 DR]] Tharra met [[Magros]]; he often helped Tharra in her missions but always gained a profit from them. 

In [[1486 DR]] in order to save both a village and a column of refugee from a [[Sembian]] army Tharra was forced to offer her soul to Magros.

Magros, however, who had planned the entire situation, sent her as his spy to the secret [[shadovar]] village for captured [[Chosen]], where she posed as a maid in the service of [[Adolican Rhand]]. She made everyone talk to each other, and kept all the people safe. She was ordered to dress [[Farideh]] with appropriate clothes.

Later, in the streets of the village, she approached to the disguised [[Dahl Peredur]]. Together they started plotting how to escape. 

At last, however, after Tharra tried to kill [[Oota]] Dahl and [[Farideh]] discovered her bargain with Magros, she told them her story, but was enchained, though Farideh later asked for her assistance recovering  a [[scroll]] from the Rhands' study. 

She was eventually taken into custody by her Harper brethren so she might explain her actions to a jury of her peers.
