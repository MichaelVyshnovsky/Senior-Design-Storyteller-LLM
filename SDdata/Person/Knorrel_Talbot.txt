'''Knorrel Talbot''' was the leader of the [[Company of the Lynx]], an adventuring group that operated throughout [[Cormyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Talbot heard an interesting tale that he believed would bring great riches to himself and his fellow adventurers. According to a lone individual, a great and ancient [[wyrm]] had devoured every diplomat and travelers that was part of a foreign envoy headed for Cormyr, during their travel across the [[Anauroch]], along with important documents that were en route to King [[Azoun IV]]. The elder dragon was then itself slain while in the Forest Country, and its massive corpse remained along the banks of the [[Wyvernwater]].

While it was a messy job, Talbot and his men recovered the documents in the dragon's innards, but discovered they were protected within [[magic]]ally-sealed pouches. When the company's spellcasters, [[Bartholeme Guin|Bartholeme]] and [[Parys Guin]] refused to use their magic to open the pouches, Talbot hired the solitary [[magic-user]] Midnight to do so, but lied about the fact they contained the [[true names]] of many prominent [[Red Wizards]] of far off [[Thay]].

While Talbot struggled to bring Midnight on as a permanent member of their group, or kill her to keep their secret, his decision was made when the young woman stole the documents and attempted to flee with them in the middle of the night. Talbot led the company in a brief pursuit, but ultimately sealed their fate and forfeit their lives upon getting close to Midnight. The young woman prayed to the goddess of magic for help, and [[Mystra]] struck down the entire company with blue fire, killing Talbot and his men, but sparing her faithful Midnight.
