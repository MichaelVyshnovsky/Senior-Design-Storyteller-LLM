'''Vorazidrar''', known among her minions as the '''Queen''', was a mighty [[black dragon]] who laired in [[Forestfall Fen]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Her immense power twisted the swampland around her and caused Forestfall Fen to begin expanding rapidly.

==Description==
She ruled over Forestfall Fen and the citizens of the village of [[Throden]], consisting of its original [[lizardfolk]] inhabitants as well as her faithful [[Queenstooth]] [[kobold]]s. She also counted the swamp's [[green hag]]s as her minions.

==Personality==
Vorazidrar loved receiving "gifts" from her minions, and demanded such gifts be delivered to her lair. She was prone to gloating.

In combat, she only used her tail rather than dirty her claws or teeth, and she had her minions ambush her enemies from behind.

==Abilities==
[[File:Black_dragon_WoW.png|thumb|''Vorazidrar enraged.'']]As an older black dragon, Vorazidrar was quite powerful. She could breathe [[acid]], strike her enemies with [[magical]] terror, and was fond of using ''[[darkness]]'' to disorient her foes. She had mighty wings that she used to buffet her enemies across the battlefield.

==Lair==
Vorazidrar made her lair in a stone cavern beneath the deepest waters in the Forestfall Fen. It was accessed by a cave that looked uncannily like a stone mouth jutting out of the swamp. She spent her time in this lair awaiting the delivery of gifts from her minions.

==Activities==

}}She purported to reward her minions for good gifts with gifts of her own&mdash;such as protection&mdash;but she would retaliate when she was displeased with a gift.

Vorazidrar's influence and power increased as she aged, and had the effect of twisting all of Forestfall Fen into a reflection of her ambition. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the entirety of Forestfall Fen had become a trap shaped by Vorazidrar's magic that was intended to lure the strongest [[adventurer]]s and entrap the wealthiest travelers.

==Relationships==
She may have had a relationship with [[Kurgaloth]], a [[pit fiend]] who leveraged an [[infernal contract]] with the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]] of [[Waterdeep]] to distract the city from nearby threats in order to increase the likelihood of the city's destruction. The Lightfingers played a role in concealing Vorazidrar's rise from the city's protectors.

==History==
Vorazidrar arrived in Forestfall Fen sometime before the 15{{th}} century DR.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Fen was growing rapidly thanks to her magic. She facilitated its growth by commanding [[Galagrave]] and the other green hags to assist her by blighting the forest surrounding the swamp. At first she was able to act without any interference from Waterdeep, until [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]] uncovered the treachery of the Lightfinger family and sent adventurers to investigate Forestfall Fen. These adventurers defeated her minions, thwarted her plans, and even bested her in combat. Rather than slay her, they forced her to retreat inside her cavernous lair by triggering a collapse of the entrance, thus trapping her and breaking her influence over the lizardfolk of Throden.

Although defeated, this did not end her desire for tribute, and she soon rallied her minions for war.
