Ilbrost Mythyl was one of the leading clerics of Mystra at the House of Wonder in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Ilbrosts lack of personal ambition stopped him from rebelling openly against the high priest, Meleghost Starseer. However, he wanted to side with the winning faction, no matter who. Because of this, he monitored the situation closely.
Ilbrost was involved in a conflict in the church over the leadership of Magister Meleghost Starseer, finding himself on the opposing faction.
