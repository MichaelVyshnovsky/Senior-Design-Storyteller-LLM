        "mainbody": "'''Greshrukk''', or '''Red Eye''', was an [[dragon aging|old]] [[red dragon]] turned into a disembodied [[dracolich]].",
        "History": "Greshrukk was to be the nascent [[Berdusk]]an [[Cult of the Dragon|Dragon Cult]]'s second attempt at creating a [[dracolich]], at the request of [[Shhuusshuru]]. When they first attempted to transform him into a night dragon however, the attempt was unsuccessful, as [[Harpers]] attacked just as the ceremony was being completed and slew Red Eye.\n\nHowever, Red Eye's spirit was not transferred into a body as planned, but was believed to reside within his intended [[phylactery]], a [[glassteeled]] ruby set into the pommel of a magic [[longsword]] named ''[[Dragonstooth]]'', which was lost in the fighting that interrupted his transformation. Both the Harpers and the Cult sought the weapon by [[1370 DR]].\n\nEventually, a band of adventurers came across the sword. The Cult got their hands on the adventurers but Greshrukk was not successfully transformed after the ensuing battle and was still trapped in the sword's pommel.<ref>{{cite book/Book of Lairs|38}}"
