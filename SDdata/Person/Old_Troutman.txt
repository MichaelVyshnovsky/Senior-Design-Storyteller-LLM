==Description==
Old Troutman was a poor commoner [[shield dwarf]] with grey hair and beard. His left eye was steely blue and the right one the color of hazel.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Old Troutman could be found on the [[Western Wet]] street in the Lower City, near a small outcropping of fishing docks. From there, Old Troutman ran his [[fish]] stall. During the [[Absolute crisis]], the dwarf continued fishing and selling his catch, despite the looming doom and the strangely polluted waters of the [[Gray Harbor]]. The same year, Old Troutman was among those citizens of the Gate who were ambushed and attacked by [[sahuagin]], who sought to sow chaos and slaughter along the Western Wet.
