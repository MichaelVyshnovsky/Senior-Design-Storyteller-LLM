        "mainbody": "Bolton Brimwell was an innkeeper of the Guts and Garters in the Lower Heart of Skullport.\nThe innkeeper would show patrons a secret passage to the alley near the Feathered Rat for an extra gold piece. For added protection, Bolton could be persuaded to have one of his guards watch the room for another golden coin.\nAround 1370 DR, Bolton was known to rent out rooms in his inn by the hour to anyone with ready coin, guaranteeing their privacy."
