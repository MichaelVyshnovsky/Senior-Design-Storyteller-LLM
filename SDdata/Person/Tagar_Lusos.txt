'''Tagar Lusos''' was an [[aquatic elf]] [[dukar]] of the [[Order of Numos]] and a member of the [[Nantarn Council]].

==Activities==
Despite his irrational hatred of [[Morgan Ildacer]], Tagar was an effective councilor and normally spoke in defense of the people of eastern [[Serôs]] ([[locathah]], [[shalarin]], and [[Qatoris]] [[morkoth]] included).
