        "Biography": "After [[Marchion]] [[Elastul Raurym]] imprisoned [[Torgar Hammerstriker]] to prevent him defecting to [[Mithral Hall]], Shingles took the responsibility of calming the angry and inciteful dwarves in the city, although he was strongly opposed to the marchion's act. When [[Agrathan Hardhammer]] came to Shingles to ask him to support the marchion's line, Shingles punched him to the ground, acting as a catalyst for a large rebellion amongst the dwarves."
