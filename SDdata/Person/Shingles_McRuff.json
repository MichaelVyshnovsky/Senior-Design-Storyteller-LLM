He had a black beard but only on the left side of his face the right side was a large scar.\nAfter Marchion Elastul Raurym imprisoned Torgar Hammerstriker to prevent him defecting to Mithral Hall, Shingles took the responsibility of calming the angry and inciteful dwarves in the city, although he was strongly opposed to the marchions act. When Agrathan Hardhammer came to Shingles to ask him to support the marchions line, Shingles punched him to the ground, acting as a catalyst for a large rebellion amongst the dwarves."
