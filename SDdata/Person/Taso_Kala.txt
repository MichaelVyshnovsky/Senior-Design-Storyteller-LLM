Taso Kala was a drow matron who lived in Ust Natha.
Around 1369 DR, she crushed a sect of Ghaunadaur worshipers, but fled to the south-east of Ust Natha. She may have asked Gorions Ward and companions to perform a service for her, which was apparently demanded by Lolth. The service was to destroy the sect completely, which was led by a high priest and the mage Relonar. She would, however, give no reward, apart from allowing the adventurers continued existence.
