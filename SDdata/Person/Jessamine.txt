==Description==
Although one of the wealthiest and most powerful merchants in Port Nyanzaru, she was a dangerous [[assassin]] by training. Her specialty was the use of poison, particularly [[torpor]].

She dressed in billowing [[robe]]s and black wrappings.

==Personality==
Jessamine was one of the more reserved merchant princes. She rarely spoke, and always carefully considered her words and actions.

She was not above scheming against other powerful figures in Port Nyanzaru, but always denied knowledge of any actions taken by her hirelings or spies.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|13}}

==Relationships==
Jessamine had a daughter, [[Yemzra]], who came as a result of a dalliance she had with a sea captain from [[Amn]]. She ensured that her daughter received a strong education, in order that she could continue her mother's business interests.

She was skeptical of [[Sibonseni]], the wealthy high [[priestess]] at the [[Hall of Gold]], whom she suspected of aspiring to become a merchant prince.

She had assassins, mercenaries, and more than one [[wizard]] in her service.

==Possessions==
She lived in a clifftop villa in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] with a balcony that overlooked Port Nyanzaru. The mansion was often dimly lit by [[oil lamp]]s and the walls were adorned with carvings of [[snake]]s. This home was protected by hooded warriors who stood like statues in the shadows.

She had a vast personal collection of poisons.

==Activities==

Jessamine held a monopoly over the sale of [[herb]]s, [[plant]]s, and poisons within the city of Port Nyanzaru.<ref group="note">While Jessamine controlled the sale of plants, she notably did not control the sale of [[fruit]], which fell under the purview of the merchant prince [[Kwayothé]]. This included a prized local poison known as [[venomtail poison]], however some [[hunter]]s like [[Doriak|Doriak of the Shells]] were known to trade for it amongst each other.

In addition, she controlled the sale of "sanctions", i.e., writs of assassination that licensed the holder to commit a murder via an approved method (usually poisoning or stabbing). She charged an extra fee to provide an assassin to carry out the killing, with satisfaction guaranteed. Her assassins made use of high quality, extremely sharp [[obsidian]] [[dagger]]s.

In her capacity as a merchant princes, she met in council with the other six princes at their palace of [[Goldenthrone]] to make governance decisions.

Jessamine often sent brave adventurers into the jungles of Chult to gather [[zabou mushroom]] samples for her. A dangerous but lucrative task.{{Template:Cite game/Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation}}

==History==
{{fq
| text   = Those who enter the jungle without a guide are like a raft of fools who set sail on the ocean—within hours they are lost and within days they die. In this great, green tangle of life, every plant is an enigma to those not initiated into the jungle’s mystery school—a translucent berry could regenerate a lost arm, a twisted vine could hold visions of another world, a handful seeds could be a cure for lycanthropy, a drop of toxin from a tiny frog could kill a hill giant.

}}In her youth, Jessamine worked as an [[assassin]] for one of the [[pasha]]s of [[Calimshan]]. She died during one of her assignments, and was [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]] at great cost to her patron.

When the ''[[death curse]]'' was released upon [[Toril]],{{ToA-time}} Jessamine began to wither away as her prior resurrection began to unravel. To hide her affliction, Jessamine wrapped her body in black bandages and wore heavy [[scarves]].{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|45}}

During the ''death curse'' investigation, Jessamine helmed the effort to make routes of Chult safe from recent increase of [[vegepygmy]] attacks. She instructed [[Eku]] and a group of adventurers to track down and slay one of the vegepygmy chieftains. Following its death, the plant creatures dispersed, fleeing into the jungle, making the paths relatively safe for travel once again. Shortly after, Jessamine asked the adventurers for one more favor, slaying the massive [[girallon]] known as the [[Great Ape]], who was ravaging the routes outside of Port Nyanzaru. In exchange, she offered leads on the ''death curse'' investigation gained through her wizards' [[divination]]s.
