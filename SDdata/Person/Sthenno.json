        "mainbody": "thenno was a medusa.The text never calls Sthenno a medusa or describes her. However, given that Marrec had snakes growing out of his hair as an infant and later developed a petrifying gaze upon puberty, he is strongly implied to have medusa ascendance. The blightlord Damanda describes him as a medusa when he reveals his powers, and Marrec himself considers the use of his power as calling upon a medusas gaze. Euryale and Sthenno, Marrecs aunts, consider themselves to be of a specific kind with Marrecs mother, distinct from Marrecs father Thanial Selwander claims one of Marrecs parents mustve been human. Furthermore, Sthenno, Medusa, and Euryale are the names of the three [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon gorgons] in the Greek myth of Medusa. Thus, this article concludes that Marrecs mother is a medusa, and so are her sisters.\nSthenno was Marrecs aunt. Unlike her sisters, she sometimes missed his hiding spot while playing hide and seek. Neither she nor her sister, Euryale, liked when Marrecs mother brought up the memory of his father, insisting that he was too vulnerable, and not of their kin.\nAuntie Sthenno was playing hide and seek with Marrec on the night he went missing."
