He was convinced by Krimgol Muzgardt to mount an attack on the [[deep gnome]] section of the trading post to capture the wizard [[Yantha Coaxrock]], leader of the [[Stoneheart Enclave]] in [[Blingdenstone]], who had tricked Krimgol over a gem (in truth a madness-causing [[gem]] from the [[demon lord]] [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]). The operation went well but started a civil war in the trading post.\n\nGhuldur and Krimgol then threatened to feed Yantha to his xorn in order to interrogate her for there whereabouts of the gem.",
        "Relationship": "Ghuldur was a good friend of fellow merchant [[Krimgol Muzgardt]]. He had a [[xorn]] as his \"pet\"."
