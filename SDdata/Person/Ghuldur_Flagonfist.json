        "mainbody": "Ghuldur Flagonfist was a duergar merchant from Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.\nCirca 1486 DR, Ghuldur was the main representative of Gracklstugh in Mantol-Derith, where he sold armor, arrowheads, locks, mining and smithing equipment, and smoked Darklake fish. He was convinced by Krimgol Muzgardt to mount an attack on the deep gnome section of the trading post to capture the wizard Yantha Coaxrock, leader of the Stoneheart Enclave in Blingdenstone, who had tricked Krimgol over a gem (in truth a madness-causing gem from the demon lord Fraz-Urbluu). The operation went well but started a civil war in the trading post.\nGhuldur and Krimgol then threatened to feed Yantha to his xorn in order to interrogate her for there whereabouts of the gem.\nGhuldur was a good friend of fellow merchant Krimgol Muzgardt. He had a xorn as his \"pet\"."
