'''Gorstal Hammers''' was an adventuring [[wizard]] who lived in [[Telpir]] on the [[Dragon Coast]], ''circa'' [[1360 DR]].

==Personality==
Gorstal was a womanizer that had a taste for ladies in the upper echelons of society.

==Relationships==
Hammers was a business partner with [[Endreth Molipher]], a former [[pirate]], and two other wizards, [[Halartan Groune]], and [[Orbel Mhaerouzan]].

==Activities==
Gorstal found a new use for creatures that he encountered while adventuring—he subdued and captured them instead of killing them, and delivered them to Molipher's island of [[Storna]] (not far from Telpir) in the [[Inner Sea]] for fun and profit. He and his fellow wizards helped make Molipher's [[Dark Dragon Hunt]]s a success by providing the dangerous creatures that would be hunted, and by altering the dreams of hapless clients that failed to bag a monster so that they felt as if they had actually engaged in heroic battle with a deadly wild animal and triumphed.{{Cite dragon/282/The New Adventures of Volo: The Urge to Hunt|72}}

==Possessions==
As part of the agreement, Gorstal was allowed to use the island as place to store items he wanted protected, or as a hideout.
