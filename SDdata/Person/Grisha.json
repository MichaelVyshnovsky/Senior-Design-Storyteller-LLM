        "mainbody": "'''Grisha''' was a [[human]] cultist of [[Yeenoghu]] in the [[Labyrinth]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Grisha was a slave of the [[drow]] until he escaped and made his way to the very small village of [[Filthriddens]] inside the [[Labyrinth]]. There, he lived under constant fear of [[minotaur]] raiders.\n\n''Circa'' [[1482 DR]], Grisha saw a minotaur horde march against the village but then be destroyed by the [[demon lord]] [[Yeenoghu]]. So Grisha devoted himself to the [[gnoll]] god and soon the cult of Yeenoghu gained control of Filthriddens with Grisha as their leader.",
        "Personality": "A strict ruler, Grisha believed he sensed the power of Yeenoghu in all things and that he was behind the cultists being resurrected as [[ghoul]]s after they died."
