        "Description": "Irae was striking for a drow, as she was an [[albino]], a seldom seen variant known as a [[szarkai]]. An eerily beautiful elf, Irae had white skin and a hairless head whilst her body seemed to be wrapped in a glowing green mist that surrounded her shoulders and chest, then rose up behind her head like a cloak.",
        "Posessions": "Irae carried few items, but those she did possess were potent indeed. On her right hand was a fine metal guantlet known as the ''[[claw of the revenancer]]'' and in her left she held a long black rod, that spurted pale green flame from one end, known as the ''[[rod of the twisted Weave]]''. Lastly, she wore the ''[[eyes of the spider]]'', a silver plate studded with a row of rubies that adorned her head like a tight-fitting helm and extended down to cover her left eye as well.",
        "History": {
            "Early life": "During Irae T'sarran's youth, she was a young noble of [[House T'sarran]] in [[Maerimydra]]. However, one day while Irae was away from the city, the other [[drow]] noble houses of the city turned a blind eye to the destruction of the rest of her house by a rival. This event caused her to turn to [[Kiaransalee]], the drow deity of vengence, and with the few remaining survivors of House T'sarran's destruction she hid in Maerimydra until she could enact her vengeance.",
            "Silence of Lolth": "Irae's opportunity arrived in the wake of the [[Silence of Lolth]], in [[1372 DR]], when the clergy of [[Lolth]] in Maerimydra were stripped of their powers. On [[Eleint 23]] the [[archmage]] of the city, [[Duneth Wharreil]]; and his allies of [[ogre]]s, [[giant]]s and [[demon]]s led by [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]], took this chance to invade the city. As the chaos of the assault unfolded, Irae and her cult followers eradicated the [[House Ch√ªmavh]], the ruling house that permitted House T'sarran's destruction, and by [[Eleint 28]] and taken control of [[Castle Maerimydra]]. From that vantage point, Irae struck out and slew the archmage, turning him into a [[silveraith]] in the process, and toppled his [[Shattered Tower]] on [[Marpenoth 2]]. Although still besieged by the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn, the high priestes made preparations to take over the city fully by developing her ''[[great revenance]]'' spell. To this end she summoned the [[Undying Temple]] in Castle Maerimydra and dispatched her children, [[Dorina T'sarran|Dorina]] and [[Zedarr T'sarran]] to harry the surface lands. It was her hope that this spell would allow her to cleanse the city of Kurgoth Hellspawn's besieging forces and lead an army of [[revenant]]s against the surface lands."
