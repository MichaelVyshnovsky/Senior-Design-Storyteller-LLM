        "mainbody": "First Guardian '''Dumal Erard''' was a [[paladin]]-priest of [[Helm]], and an adventuring member of the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] who later went on to found the community of [[Helm's Hold]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Quite fitting for a paladin of Helm, Dumal was noted for being a strong war-time leader.",
        "Activities": "For years Dumal and his company ventured around the [[Sword Coast North]], based out of the great metropolis of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Relationships": "Among his fellow Company of Crazed Venturers were the skilled [[fighter]] [[Loene]]; the repeatedly-slain-and-raised [[wizard]] [[Nain Keenwhistler]], the still-deceased warrior [[Tzarrakyn]] the elder; [[Filiare]], founder of the [[Inn of the Dripping Dagger]], [[Trunnigan Regallis]], one of the few [[human]]s allowed to live on [[Evermeet]]; [[Tolgar Anuvien]], the founder of [[Goldenfields]]; and two [[wizard]]s of the [[Harpers]], [[Savengriff]] and [[Malchor Harpell]].",
        "History": "At some point in his career, Dumal defeated [[Iltmul]] at the [[Citadel of the Mists]] and attained the tile of White Master of Dragons. He later defended the title against the [[monk]] known as [[Hlam]].\n\nAfter Dumal settled down from his life as an adventurer, he relocated to the farming community known as [[Helm's Stead]] and began work on a great monastery dedicated to his patron deity. By {{YearlinkName|1350}}, he and his allies managed to officially found the fortified temple of [[Helm's Hold]]. He defended his title as First Guardian and ruler of the city at least six times over several decades after its founding."
