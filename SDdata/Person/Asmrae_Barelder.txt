Lady Asmrae Barelder was the wife of Lord Montror Barelder, head of the Barelder family in the 15 century DR.
Asmrae was a stoic and careful woman with great self-control and patience, widely regarded as an "ice queen" for her silent and calculating demeanour.
Asmrae loved her husband dearly and assisted him in all matters, taking care of the administration and finances of their holdings. She raised her eldest Narnathra to be a wise and responsible ruler following her father.
After her husband was slain in 1479 DR, Asmrae was heartbroken and followed him into the afterlife in 1482 DR.
