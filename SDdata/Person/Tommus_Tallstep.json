        "mainbody": "Tommus Tallstep was a halfling fighter and adventurer active in the late 15 century DR around Waterdeep.\nHe stood at  and weighed about , and had pale skin with brown hair and beautiful eyes. His ally and friend Halbenet Soladonel was known to joke that Tommus had to wear a helmet just so his enemies would stop looking at his eyes. He generally preferred equipment that was both functional in combat but also stylish and appropriate in the company of nobles.\nHe was quick and sure-footed, having been likened to a fox.\nTommus was proud and a perfectionist. Despite having a strong sense of duty toward his community, he was distrustful and assumed the worst of most whom he met. He hated letting his enemies escape.\nthumb|A helmet emblazoned with Tommuss fox symbol.Tommus was proficient in the use of swords and battleaxes, and owned a number of enchanted weapons such as a sword of embers, an axe of sharpness, and the axe of great cleaving given to him by Laeral Silverhand. However, his preference was to wield a short sword and a shield, with his favorites being the combinations know as the warriors duo and the dragon brace and fang. He wore enchanted plate mail along with matching magical boots known as the fox paws. He possessed a number of other magic items as well, including an ioun stone of awareness, bracers of defense, fists of rebuke, and restoration flasks. He always carried a bag or pouch with him, often one which he had made himself. His go-to haversack was one which he had made as a gift for Laeral Silverhand, who was so impressed with it that she enchanted it and asked him to use it in her name.\nTommus had a natural aptitude for combat and a gift for strategy. He was said to be able to defeat a crowd of foes as efficiently as a single enemy.\nHe was known to volunteer for adventuring jobs posted by Open Lord Laeral Silverhand. He regarded as allies his adventuring companions Halbenet Soladonel, Naomlen Girdaur, and Shevarith Kendia.\nOriginally a leatherworker, Tommuss first shipment of goods was attacked on the way to Waterdeep, inadvertently serving as the start for his career as a warrior when he discovered his greater knack for fighting than for business.\nHe went on to spend years training as a fighter. His constant sparring caused him to ruin his armor, but left him with reflexes quick enough to block nearly any enemy blow.\nBy the time he was 45 years old in the late 15 century DR, he fought to protect Waterdeep at the behest of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand as both a guard and an adventurer. In recognition of his service, she bestowed him with the captains helmet."
