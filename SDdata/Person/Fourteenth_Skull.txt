The '''Fourteenth Skull''' was the legendary "extra" skull in [[Skullport]].
 
==Personality==
Although he was similar in nature to the [[Skulls of Skullport]], he operated independently unlike the Skulls who seemed to behave collectively.  The Fourteenth Skull was rarely seen and when a person saw him it was usually discounted as a drunk's hallucinations.

==Activities==
His true purpose in Skullport was to strengthen the [[mythal]] around Skullport known as the [[Mantle]].  He was aided by thirteen [[mage]]s that he hand selected, known as the [[Fray]].

==History==
The Fourteenth Skull's background was similar to that of the other skulls.  At one time he was a [[drow]] known as the '''Rag Mage''' who moved to the [[Netheril|Netherese]] enclave that became Skullport and was apparently caught in the [[magic|magical]] backlash during [[Karsus's Folly]].
