The Fourteenth Skull was the legendary "extra" skull in Skullport.
Although he was similar in nature to the Skulls of Skullport, he operated independently unlike the Skulls who seemed to behave collectively.  The Fourteenth Skull was rarely seen and when a person saw him it was usually discounted as a drunks hallucinations.
His true purpose in Skullport was to strengthen the mythal around Skullport known as the Mantle.  He was aided by thirteen mages that he hand selected, known as the Fray.
The Fourteenth Skulls background was similar to that of the other skulls.  At one time he was a drow known as the Rag Mage who moved to the Netherese enclave that became Skullport and was apparently caught in the magical backlash during Karsuss Folly.
