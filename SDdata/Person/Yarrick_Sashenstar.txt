'''Yarrick Sashenstar''' was a Ser patron of the arts from the [[Sashenstar]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ser Yarrick Sashenstar was invited to attend the art show titled "Strange Tides: Self-Portraits from the Sword Coast," hosted by [[Lady Jannath]] in her [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] estate. Yarrick RSVP'd to attend but insisted on bringing his very young triplets along, despite Lady Jannath politely reminding him that her manse didn't offer attendant nursemaids for the guests.
