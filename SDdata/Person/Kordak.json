        "Personality": "Kordak was selfish, bloodthirsty, and deceitful.",
        "Abilities": "As a wizard he knew a number of spells: ''[[charm person]], [[magic missile]], [[stinking cloud]], [[shield]], [[invisibility]]''. Notably, none of those spells controlled undead. He was also slighly better defended than one would expect, presumably due to fairly good agility.",

        "Relationships": "He had two [[zombie]] servants and a pet [[snake]].",
        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Kordak was in a dilapidated tower within the caverns of [[Mount Dread]], where he tried to set up a secret hideout. If adventurers came across him, he may have tried to ''charm'' one of them into helping with a nearby ''black bear'', then ambush them with his zombie underlings and magic after they succeeded, or should they refuse."
