        "mainbody": "adventurer\nDevuri was a crayfish hengeyokai shukenja and priest of the Lords of Creation in the town of Kataburi in the Kuong Kingdom in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was previously an adventurer.\nCirca 1357 DR, Devuri led the towns temple to a local river spirit, who was believed to bless Kataburi with its giant crayfish. He had many contacts with fellow water-dwelling creatures of the river.\nSome, such as the old nun Ama, didnt like that Devuri was employed as a priest and thought he wasted too much of his time in the river, but this was likely prejudice."
