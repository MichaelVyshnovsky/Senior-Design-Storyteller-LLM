She carried a magic +1 composite longbow and kept arrows of biting, acid arrows, and mundane arrows in her quiver. In close combat, Yi Niu wielded a +1 magical bastard sword. She wore a ring of duplication on a finger and had a potion of superior healing, a potion of extra healing, and a potion of invulnerability ready.\nYi Niu died many moons before the late 14 century DR. In life, she was a ranger and one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi. She continued to do the same long after death. In the , the crypt faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon. The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypts dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard. At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master Larloch, who sought the tombs magical treasure. A ghostly monk named Ki Chin Sang stood guard of Nan Kung Chis tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chis trusted undead lieutenants who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Yi Niu was joined by Weimin Min, Borok-Tosst, Ming-hua Dai, and Jiang Dai, and, presumably, was defeated."
