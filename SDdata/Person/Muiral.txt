Muiral the Misshapen was an apprentice of Halaster Blackcloak, the Mad Mage of Undermountain.
A capable fighter in his youth, Muiral was recruited by Halaster as a bodyguard but soon he started studying under Halaster as a wizard. He learned to magically graft materials together. When Halaster broke off all contact, he descended into madness, grafting his own torso onto the body of a giant scorpion to better engage in combat.
