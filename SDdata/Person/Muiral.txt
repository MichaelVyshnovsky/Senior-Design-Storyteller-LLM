'''Muiral the Misshapen''' was an apprentice of [[Halaster Blackcloak]], the Mad Mage of [[Undermountain]].

A capable fighter in his youth, Muiral was recruited by Halaster as a bodyguard but soon he started studying under Halaster as a [[wizard]]. He learned to magically graft materials together. When Halaster broke off all contact, he descended into madness, grafting his own torso onto the body of a [[giant scorpion]] to better engage in combat.<ref>
