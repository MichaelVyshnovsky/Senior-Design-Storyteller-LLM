        "mainbody": "'''Mo Kin''' was a [[monk]] of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] and the abbot of [[Pokarr Gompa]] in [[Tabot]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.",
        "Activities": "Mo Kin was both the leader of the Pokarr monastery and one of the Lon Chen (chief ministers), whose role was to advise the High Lord of Tabot. Being abbot of Pokarr, he was also commander of its strong militia and was responsible for patrolling Tabot's eastern border with [[Shou Lung]] north of [[Mount E'kwong]]. As such, he was one of the more influential men of Tabot.\n\nDespite his old age, four or five times a year he traveled to other northern [[monasteries]] to attend their festivals.",
        "Personality": "Mo Kin was quiet and contemplative and had a reputation for being very patient and giving good advice, but also being slow to make decisions. His fellow lamas thought him a fair and talented administrator. He was a faithful follower of the Way of Enlightenment and the High Lord of Oceans.",
        "Description": "Even at the age of 78, he was unexpectedly spry and active.",
        "History": "When the city of [[Rokstang]] was inundated by a great flood in {{YearlinkConvert|2601|SY}}, Mo Kin used one of the ''[[golden eggs of Ghastar]]'' (which were kept in the monastery) to stop the flood.<ref>\n\nFor a great festival at the [[Temple of Heaven's Heart]] on Mount E'kwong ''circa'' 2607, Abbot Mo Kin chose the monk scribe [[Pang]] to represent Pokarr Gompa, releasing him from an eight-year-long vow of silence in the process. The grateful Pang later described him as his benefactor and \"the wisest of all abbots\" to the Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]]."
