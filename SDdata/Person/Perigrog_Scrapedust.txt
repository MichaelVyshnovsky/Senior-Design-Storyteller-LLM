Perigrog Scrapedust was a deep gnome and owner of the Whiteshell Mine, a salt mine, in Blingdenstone in the late 15 century DR.
He was fair minded but demanding of his workers.
Circa 1486 DR, Perigrog tried to get the mine to produce as much salt as possible, in order to export as much as possible, so that this would restore the citys fortunes sooner.
