        "mainbody": "Isthana Ro was the guild master of the Rogues Guild in Hillsfar in the late 15 century DR.\nIsthana managed the Rogues Guild, which was the official thieves guild of Hillsfar.\nCirca 1486 DR, Isthana agreed to work with the Harpers in order to arrange a change in the citys politics. She helped to smuggle an adventuring party hired by Elanil Elassidil into the city using the sewers. She told the adventurers about the First Lords Midsummer Masquerade ball.\nSpies had reported to Isthana that some agents from Maerimydra had infiltrated the First Lords court. It was also reported that the Lord was planning a rare trip outside of the city walls for a trade meeting with Damaran leaders in the city of YÃ»lash.\nIsthana was very smart and cared only about her guild. However, she also had amazingly acute business sense and the ability to think ahead. Isthana decided that supporting the Harpers was the best for her guild, instead seeing Torin Nomerthal as the biggest problem in the city."
