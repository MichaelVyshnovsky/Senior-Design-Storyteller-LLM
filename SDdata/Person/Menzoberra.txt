Menzoberra was a drow high priestess of Lolth, who founded the city of Menzoberranzan.
After decades of infighting among the drow of Golothaer, and at the behest of the Spider Queen, who gave her the title Yorthae (the Chosen), Menzoberra the Kinless led seven drow families from their southern holdings of Great Bhaerynden into the Northdark.
 When escorting the refugees through the caverns, she came across dwarven mines, inhabited by the iron mining Clan Black Axe. The two groups fought in a fierce battle, but eventually Menzoberras forces prevailed. They, however, took significant losses, and their numbers were halved. As the last dwarf, Dorn Black Axe, fell to the ground, he cursed her invaders and wished upon them "the doom of many eyes".
By , after several years in the dark deeps of the Underdark, the refugees came to a giant cavern inhabited by a swarm of spiders and the legendary beholder, Many Eyes. After a long battle with many losses for the drow, Menzoberra laid the final blow on the beholder. When the battle was over, a yochlol appeared in front of the surviving drow proclaiming the cavern was to be their new home "Menzoberranzan" in recognition of Menzoberras service to Lolth.
