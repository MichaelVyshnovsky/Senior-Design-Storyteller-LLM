He also wore a ring with a scratched device of a serpent ready to strike, which was shared by some bandits of the Skuldaskar, including Drace and Algan.\nIn , he was present at the Heralds Horn tavern the night that Elminster Aumar purchased a wyrmtongue scepter from Surgath Ilder. Karlmuth Hauntokh showed some of his own loot, and later inspected one of the rubies which Elminster had paid Surgath with. The prince noticed that Karlmuth wore a ring with the same motif as some bandits that had attacked him earlier."
