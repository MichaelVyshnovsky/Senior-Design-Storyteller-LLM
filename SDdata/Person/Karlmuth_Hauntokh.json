        "Description": "He was fatter and hairier than Surgath Ilder, and dressed in tattered clothes.",
        "Personality": "He was more arrogant than [[Surgath Ilder]].",
        "Possessions": "As of {{yearlink|240}}, he had a stout, worn sword, a smattering of utilitarian devices, and had looted a golden sphere set in with gems from an [[elven]] tomb which he claimed to be from [[Elanvae]]. He also wore a ring with a scratched device of a serpent ready to strike, which was shared by some bandits of the [[Skuldaskar]], including [[Drace (bandit)|Drace]] and [[Algan]].",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|240}}, he was present at the [[Herald's Horn]] tavern the night that [[Elminster Aumar]] purchased a ''[[wyrmtongue scepter]]'' from [[Surgath Ilder]]. Karlmuth Hauntokh showed some of his own loot, and later inspected one of the [[ruby|rubies]] which Elminster had paid Surgath with. The prince noticed that Karlmuth wore a ring with the same motif as some bandits that had attacked him earlier."
