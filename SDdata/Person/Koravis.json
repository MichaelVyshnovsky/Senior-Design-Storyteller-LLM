        "mainbody": "Koravis was the fiendish raven companion of Bane, the god of tyranny.\nKoravis was a tiny bird with sharp claws.\nHe was swift and deadly with his claws, and possessed the ability to smite good once each day. He was highly resilient to attacks&mdashand even more so against fire and cold&mdashassuming that a foe could even land a blow on the highly evasive raven.\nKoravis had keen senses, including darkvision.\nBane and Koravis could speak to each other and were connected by both an empathic link and a powerful blood bond, which enhanced the ravens might and skill whenever he witnessed any threat or harm to Bane. The ravens reflexes, will, and fortitude were also closely tied to those of the dark god.\nKoravis was known to accompany Bane as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR,"
