        "mainbody": "Tlanaggathur, who was simply nicknamed the Conjurer, was a powerful but reclusive wizard inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe spent most of his time secluded within his mansion, practicing the summoning and control of creatures from other places. He utilized the creatures as servants to perform special errands usually involving retrieving magic items or rare material components from across Faer√ªn.\nThe gate of his large mansion was decorated with eight hands that were painted black. Locals whispered that they were remnants of other wizards who attempted to steal Tlanaggathurs magic."
