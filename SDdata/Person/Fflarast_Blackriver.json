        "History": "Fflarast was one of the soldiers of the contingent led by Swordlord [[Amglar]].\n\nOn [[Flamerule 17]] of [[1358 DR]], he was sent together with [[Baeremuth Asanter]] to find a secret route to enter [[Mistledale]]. However, Baeremuth was killed by a trap that caused a landslip . He went back to report to his superior [[Pelaeron]] about the possibility of traps but another trap destroyed the command post, killing Pelaeron.\n\nFflarast survived and found a large cave system. Soon ore Zhentilar soldiers and the [[Zhentarim]] high wizard [[Nentor Thuldoum]] arrived to explore the area. However, once again, a trap killed them all and only Fflarast survived, while Nentor [[teleport]]ed himself away.\n\nAt last, during the main battle between the Zhent army and the defenders of Mistledale, Fflarast died killing an old [[Harper]]."
