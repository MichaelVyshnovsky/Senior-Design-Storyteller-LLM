'''Losvius Longnose''' was a teamster on the [[Sword Coast]] just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==Personality==
Losvius's surname derived not from his big nose but from his overpowering thirst for gossip about other people. Losvius was fixated on uncovering others' embarrassing secrets.

==History==
Around [[1489 DR]], Losvius acted as a teamster for a great caravan that, unknown to him, was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]].
