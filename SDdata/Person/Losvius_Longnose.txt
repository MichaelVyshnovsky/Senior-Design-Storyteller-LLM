Losvius Longnose was a teamster on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Losviuss surname derived not from his big nose but from his overpowering thirst for gossip about other people. Losvius was fixated on uncovering others embarrassing secrets.
Around 1489 DR, Losvius acted as a teamster for a great caravan that, unknown to him, was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
