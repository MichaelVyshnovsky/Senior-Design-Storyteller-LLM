Ahtayir was a djinni in service to the Cult of the Howling Hatred at the Temple of Howling Hatred in Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
In the past, Torhild Flametongue, king of the Besilmer dwarves, found a horn capable of summoning Ahtayir. Torhild used the djinnis services to build part of his royal palace.
In 1491 DR, Aerisi Kalinoth found the horn and summoned Ahtayir once again. She ordered him to rebuild all of Tyar-Besil to its former glory.
