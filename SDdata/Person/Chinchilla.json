Chinchilla was exceptionally intelligent and dexterous.\nAs a formidable mage, Chinchilla was able to cast some of the most powerful spells in the Realms. She was naturally hasted, could move and attack very swiftly, and could even morph into a different form. Chinchilla had the ability to transform into a greater wolfwere, and could generate her pool of health extremely quickly.\nUnlike other leporine creatures, Chinchilla was very well naturally armored and could survive many blows. She was also highly resistant to magic as well as melee and ranged weapons.\nChinchilla had formed some sort of brotherhood with other atypical Bhaalspawn these were Toop the Brave, Tibbit, and Merlinious.\nSome time prior to the Time of Troubles, Chinchillas mother somehow came to be pregnant with the seed of the Lord of Murder, Bhaal.\nIn 1369 DR, Chinchilla could be found outside of Yaga-Shuras abode in the Marching Mountains, alongside her Bhaalspawn half-brothers. When discovered, they planned to run out of sight, so as to not get murdered by other Bhaalspawn."
