Queen '''Connomae''' was a [[fomorian]] who lived in the [[Feywild]] realm of [[Vor Thomil]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}

==Activities==
Connomae protected Vor Thomil and allowed passage between her realm and [[Oman's Isle]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]]. She wished to eventually expand her realm onto Oman's Isle and use that as a base to envelop the rest of the Moonshae archipelago. This would provide her with a large quantity of slaves that she would sent back to the Feywild and use during an assault on the city of [[Shinaelestra]].
