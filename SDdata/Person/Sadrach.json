        "Description": "He venerated the four [[elemental lord]]s; [[Akadi]], [[Grumbar]], [[Istishia]], and [[Kossuth]]. He maintained four separate temples dedicated to each of them within his castle.",
        "Personality": "He was a confidant and learned man in life, who became filled with unrelenting rage while living in a cursed state of existence.",
        "Relationships": "His only known relative was his daughter [[Gingrid]], a young [[necromancer]] who was granted unnaturally long longevity and youth.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|280}}",
        "History": "When the [[Spellplague]] struck [[Toril]], in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Sadrach believed his magic was strong enough to protect the people within his castle. Unfortunately he was wrong. Those who were not killed outright became inflicted with [[spellscar]]s, or worse yet, were transformed into [[plaguechanged]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|281}} \n\nLike many of his people, Sadrach was transformed into one of the \"wallbound\", unfortunate souls who became trapped within the structure of Sadrach Castle. He languished in this cursed state, as four stone faces and pairs of arms attached to the keep, filled with an uncontrollable fury for over a century.\n\nDuring the events of the [[Second Sundering]], in the final days of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, three of the gods' [[chosen]] and [[shade]]s from [[Netheril]] came into conflict at Sadrach's Spire,{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|279}} causing the castle to crash into ruin. Sadrach and the unfortunate wallbound were freed from their stony prison, left to return to their loved ones. He aged wizard was last heard crying out for joy, thanking the divine beings of the Realms for his freedom.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|295}}"
