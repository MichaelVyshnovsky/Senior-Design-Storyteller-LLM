The Skum Lord was an aboleth prominent in Skullport in 1370 DR. 
The Skum Lord was the primary agent of the Kraken Society in Skullport. It owned almost forty percent of Skullports buildings and inhabitants. If a person refused or could not pay their monthly rent, the Skum Lords skum servitors would drag them off to the monsters lair for sinister purposes.
In his spying actives, the Skum Lord used many normal citizens of Skullport as informants, communicating with them through telepathic links.
