The '''Skum Lord''' was an [[aboleth]] prominent in [[Skullport]] in [[1370 DR]]. 

==Activities==
The Skum Lord was the primary agent of the [[Kraken Society]] in Skullport. It owned almost forty percent of Skullport's buildings and inhabitants. If a person refused or could not pay their monthly rent, the Skum Lord's [[skum]] servitors would drag them off to the monster's lair for sinister purposes.

In his spying actives, the Skum Lord used many normal citizens of Skullport as informants, communicating with them through telepathic links.
