'''Fidelio Santabalo''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] who tried to single-handledly rid [[Undermountain]] of evil, but in the process fell victim to a [[curse]] and became trapped as a [[ghost]] within its depths.

==Description==
Fidelio's spirit appeared to people in the form of a man with a thin face, sunken cheeks, and ragged stubble. His ghost dressed in shining armor befitting a [[knight]], but pitted and scarred, with the [[balance scale|balanced scales]] symbol of Tyr emblazoned on the [[breastplate]]. Along with this he wore a [[tunic]] that appeared stained and rotting, a hole torn where a symbol would have been, and carried a dented [[shield]].

The air around his spirit reeked of cheap [[cologne]]

==Personality==
In life, Fidelio had always been certain of his superiority over his fellows and unabashed by the criticisms of friends and foes. In undeath, although he was not evil, he was willing to do anything to break his [[curse]], even endangering innocents.

==History==
Fidelio in life was a paladin of a god of justice. He went to Undermountain to battle evil. There, he fought a powerful [[fiend]] of the nether planes to a stalemate. He asked his god's help to win, but after the victory Fidelio was arrogant and belittled his foe. So his god decided to punish him by cursing him: he was condemned to wander Undermountain as a [[ghost]] and punish braggarts like himself by teleporting them into dangerous spots of the dungeon.

For decades, Fidelio wandered the dungeon, but the magic energies unleashed by the death of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] in [[1375 DR]] weakened his curse and amplified his [[teleport]]ation powers. He had identified three magical objects that combined could break his curse, but needed someone with a physical body to recover them.

==Activities==
Fidelio used his teleport powers to send braggarts, and also people with them, into dangerous spots in the dungeon.
