        "mainbody": "Ozamata Ku Murawa was a human thief, one of the Underbarons of Bral, the leader of House Murawa, and the founder of the Yakuza thieves guild on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was also a member of the Council of Captains and was the richest and most powerful Shou on the Rock.Although described as Shou in the Rock of Bral sourcebook, Ozamatas name and culture suggest he is in fact Wanese, from Wa, who are also active in Realmspace but sometimes merged with the Shou.\nUnderbaron Murawa was described as a harsh man.\nAged 50, Ozamata was a short, potbellied man who wore his hair in the traditional Shou style.\nOzamata wore an obi of protection around his kimono and bracers of defense on his forearms. He carried a magical wakizashi and a war fan.It is possible that this \"war fan\" was instead a gunsen, a defensive weapon. He also possessed a vial containing oil of slipperiness and three pinches of dust of sneezing and choking.\nHouse Murawa was one of the largest buildings in the Low City. It was located west of Shou-town on Dock Street and overlooked the docks at the leading edge of the Rock. \nThe Underbaron was an accomplished thief.\nOzamata led the powerful trading family of House Murawa and the thieves guild of the yakuza, both of which he founded. In addition, many of the Shou living on the Rock of Bral considered him the leader of their small community, but Kurishi Otobe, known as the Dragon Lady, was one Shou on Bral who opposed his organizations, while Lord Chan Fu Wi, ambassador of Shou Lung, ignored them both.\nOzamatas yakuza ruled Shou-town and controlled the Docks and much of the Low City. They engaged in extortion, racketeering, and gambling and were marked by their tattoos. Ozamata commanded around 40 yakuza, but could recruit up to 60 thugs if needed.\nHailing from Kara-Tur, Ozamata Ku Murawa was among the first Shou to explore wildspace. When he came to the Rock of Bral, he decided to settle in the city there.\nOver time, he established both his trading company and his thieves guild, and he fought to rise to a place of leadership on Brals Council of Captains, those who owned ships and land on the Rock of Bral. By the 1360s DR, he was the wealthiest and most influential Shou human in Bral."
