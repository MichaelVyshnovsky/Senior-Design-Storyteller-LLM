        "mainbody": "'''Ozamata Ku Murawa''' was a [[human]] [[thief]], one of the [[Underbaron]]s of [[Bral]], the leader of [[House Murawa]], and the founder of the [[Yakuza (Bral)|Yakuza]] [[thieves' guild]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was also a member of the [[Council of Captains]] and was the richest and most powerful [[Shou]] on the Rock.Although described as Shou in the ''Rock of Bral'' sourcebook, Ozamata's name and culture suggest he is in fact [[Wanese]], from [[Wa]], who are also active in [[Realmspace]] but sometimes merged with the Shou.",
        "Personality": "Underbaron Murawa was described as a harsh man.",
        "Description": "Aged 50, Ozamata was a short, potbellied man who wore his hair in the traditional Shou style.",
        "Possessions": "Ozamata wore an ''[[obi of protection]]'' around his kimono and ''[[bracers of defense]]'' on his forearms. He carried a magical [[wakizashi]] and a [[war fan]].<ref group=\"note\">It is possible that this \"war fan\" was instead a [[gunsen]], a defensive weapon. He also possessed a vial containing ''[[oil of slipperiness]]'' and three pinches of ''[[dust of sneezing and choking]]''.\n\nHouse Murawa was one of the largest buildings in the Low City. It was located west of [[Shou-town (Bral)|Shou-town]] on [[Dock Street (Bral)|Dock Street]] and overlooked the docks at the leading edge of the Rock.",
        "Abilities": "The Underbaron was an accomplished thief.",
        "Activities": "Ozamata led the powerful trading family of House Murawa and the [[thieves guild]] of the yakuza, both of which he founded. In addition, many of the Shou living on the Rock of Bral considered him the leader of their small community, but [[Kurishi Otobe]], known as the Dragon Lady, was one Shou on Bral who opposed his organizations, while Lord [[Chan Fu Wi]], ambassador of [[Shou Lung]], ignored them both.<ref>\n\nOzamata's [[yakuza]] ruled [[Shou-town (Bral)|Shou-town]] and controlled the Docks and much of the Low City.<ref> They engaged in extortion, racketeering, and gambling and were marked by their [[tattoo]]s. Ozamata commanded around 40 yakuza, but could recruit up to 60 thugs if needed.",
        "History": "Hailing from [[Kara-Tur]], Ozamata Ku Murawa was among the first Shou to explore [[wildspace]]. When he came to the Rock of Bral, he decided to settle in the city there.\n\nOver time, he established both his trading company and his thieves' guild, and he fought to rise to a place of leadership on Bral's Council of Captains, those who owned ships and land on the Rock of Bral. By the 1360s DR, he was the wealthiest and most influential Shou human in Bral."
