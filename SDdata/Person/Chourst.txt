'''Chourst''' was the [[slaad lord]] of randomness, an agent of chaos at its most unpredictable. He was said to be a living incarnation of whimsy, spontaneously spreading disorder wherever his aimless wanderings took him.

==Description==
Chourst appeared as a gangly slaad, around {{SIrange|20|22|ft}} tall,

==Personality==
Caring for nothing but himself, Chourst's one desire was to follow his mercurial passions, impulsively indulging whatever whim struck him from moment to moment. Rarely did this behavior manifest in any constructive way, for he was too unfocused to build anything significant and too independent to worry about the affairs of other slaadi.

By most estimates, the erratic Lord of Randomness seemed utterly insane. The urge might strike him to go on a random rampage, killing and destroying everything in sight, before stopping the carnage to smell a flower or do whatever else caught his eye. This also made him an odd being to try and fight since even the throes of combat was often insufficient to hold his attention, leading him to quit the battle halfway through to do something else.

However, it was important to note that despite this behavior, the Lord of Randomness wasn't an idiot.{{Cite dragon/221/The Dragon's Bestiary: Lords of Chaos|78}}

==Powers==
Chourst was both physically powerful and had access to a great variety of spell-like abilities. He could cast ''[[advanced illusion]]'', ''[[astral projection]]'', ''[[chaos]]'', ''[[cloudkill]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[Darkness, 15' radius|darkness]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[solid fog]]'', and ''[[wind walk]]'' at will, as well as conjure a ''[[symbol]]'' of his choice three times each day. 

Chourst's very presence caused instability in reality, reverting land shaped by [[Slaad#Control_over_chaos|chaos matter]] in a {{SI|30|ft}} radius around himself into its basal state and causing spells cast within {{SI|300|ft}} of him to trigger [[wild magic]] surges, even outside of Limbo, the effects of which he was immune to. A strike from Chourst caused corporeal instability identical to that caused by [[chaos beast]]s in all living creatures, and also turned [[modron]]s into [[chaotic neutral]] rogues.

If in Limbo, he could try to summon a [[gray slaad]] or two [[green slaad]]i (the latter occurring more often when he tried) every minute with a near-perfect chance of success.

==Realm==
Chourst typically stayed within Limbo since he found its primal soup soothing, though he occasionally journeyed to other planes for a change of pace, giving him a new environment in which to cause chaos.

==Activities==

Chourst was known to frequently perform cannonballs through settlements in Limbo simply for his entertainment. He delighted in dissolving terrain shaped by chaos matter, and though it could be reassembled, it often wasn't fast enough to avoid significant harm. Outside of Limbo, he was known to leave trails of random destruction in the wake of his wildly roundabout path.

==Relationships==
Chourst was ruled by his impulses moreso than his peers, though [[Ygorl]] occasionally enjoyed his company, approving of his brand of chaos due to its entropic nature. The slaad lord also had his fair share of enemies, the githzerai having been on the receiving end of his city-destroying antics in the past.

==Worshipers==
Although Chourst had no desire for followers, knowledgeable members of the [[Xaositects]] admired his apparent appreciation and understanding of their chaotic ideals, though even they still gave him a wide berth.

==History==
On Chourst's one and only visit to [[Mechanus]], he barely survived the encounter. He created rogue modrons of all kinds throughout the plane, providing an arduous amount of work for the pentadrone police, until [[Primus]] himself showed up to deal with the mayhem he had caused. For the disorder he caused on the orderly plane, he was still a wanted outlaw.
