==Personality==
He sometimes snickered at bad times.

==Description==
He was taller than [[Glavyn]].

==Relationships==
He was a servant of Lord [[Esbre Felmorel]]. As a guard, his fellows included Glavyn,{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|563|3}} and [[Errart]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|560|3}}

==History==
One rainy spring afternoon in the {{yearlinkName|761}}, Feiryn was present when his fellow guard Glavyn tried to turn away a magic user answering to the name of [[Elminster Aumar|Wanlorn]], who insisted he was there to join Lord Esbre Felmorel at one of his feasts. Glavyn rebuffed the man repeatedly, until the man used a spell to freeze Glavyn's arms in a cross-armed position, and then Lady [[Nasmaerae Felmorel]] ushered him in, much to Glavyn's annoyance. Feiryn snickered a bit at the man's witticisms.
