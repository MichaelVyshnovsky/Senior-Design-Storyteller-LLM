        "mainbody": "'''Ganark''' was a [[bugbear]] chieftain who led his fellow bugbears in [[Mrolgyet's Legion]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Ganark and his troops were disciplined. He was known to share his allotments of food and treasure with his tribe while also assuming more than his fair share of danger in battle.",
        "History": "In the battle between Mrolgyet's Legion and the [[Lords' Alliance]] on [[Harvestshield Mountain]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Ganark led his troops to support the [[gnoll]]s led by Hnalguk. He was defeated in combat by a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]], causing his disciplined line to buckle and forcing the Legion to spread their troops out more than they wanted to."
