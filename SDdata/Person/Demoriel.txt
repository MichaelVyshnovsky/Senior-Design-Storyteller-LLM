'''Demoriel''' was a demon. It was summoned to fight against [[Gage]], a thief from [[Laothkund]], by [[Sathra]] of the [[Shadow Tongue]] thieves' guild: the [[necromancer]] called it by name. It was a black, humanoid, scaled creature, with inky teeth and claws. Wielding ''[[Angul]]'', Gage managed to slay Demoriel, but it was a tough fight: the demon showed the power to scream abyssal curses to liquify stone and metal.{{cite book/Stardeep|51-54|5}}
