Madame Rosene was the owner of the Driftwood Tavern, one of the most popular taverns of Neverwinter, and the leader of the Graycloaks faction of the Sons of Alagondar in the late years of the 15 century DR.
Madame Rosene was slow to trust in strangers, preferring to deal with the inhabitants of Neverwinter who had lived there since before the eruption of Mount Hotenow.
Besides being the owner of the Driftwood Tavern, she was also the leader of the conservative faction of the Sons of Alagondar insurgent movement, the Graycloacks.
