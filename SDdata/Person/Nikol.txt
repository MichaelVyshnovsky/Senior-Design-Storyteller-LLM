'''Nikol''' was a [[storm giant]] from the [[storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain]].<ref group="note">This fact is deduced because one of Nikol's companions was [[Ramos]], and Ramos was the former [[paramount]] of the storm giant aerie described in ''Giantcraft''.

==Description==
Nikol had pale violet skin and blue-black hair that was very long and unkempt. He was clean-shaven. Nikol typically wore a simple tunic with a large amount of silver jewelry. His eyes were silver-colored.

==Possessions==
Nikol bore a sword in battle that was twenty-feet long. It was notched and rusted.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]],{{Giantcraft date}} the then-[[paramount]] of the storm giants of Mount Woe, [[Anastes]], and five other storm giants were summoned magically by [[Lanaxis]] to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] and her son [[Kaedlaw Burdun|Kaedlaw]]. Nikol was one of those giants. Nikol and [[Ramos]] cooked a moose for Brianna to eat, but during this time, [[Tavis Burdun]] and armies of [[giant-kin]] attacked. Nikol and Ramos were ordered by Anastes to deal with the [[verbeeg]]s. Nikol's fate in the ensuing battle was never recorded.
