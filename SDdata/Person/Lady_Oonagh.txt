Lady Oonagh was an elven noblewoman and an adventurer from the Forest of Tethir, active sometime before 1372 DR.
Lady Oonagh hailed from a musically-inclined noble elven family, but unlike them, Oonagh had no musical talent and was a particularly bad singer. She often adventured with her companion and lover Lord Alex. Ladys long-time mate one year presented her with a gag birthday gift, the enchanted lute, later known as Lady Oonaghs ludicrously loud lute. Alex found it appropriate that the lute and Oonaghs voice both sounded so terrible and intense, they caused profuse ear bleeding.
