Burtrar Malith was a veteran bodyguard and caravan guard as well as a member of the Company of the Cloak.
Burtar was particularly quiet and grim.
Along with all of the other members of the Company of the Cloak, Burtrar possessed an immunity to oil of taggit (which caused unconsciousness).
Burtat acted completely loyal to Mhair Gulzrabban, so as not to be deemed expendable yet wished to one day betray the partys leader and retire.
