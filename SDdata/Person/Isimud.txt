Isimud was the wizard leader of the Enclave in Unther in 1357 DR.
Isimud was a very old wizard, relying on magical means to move.
Isimud was in search of some powerful artifacts of the Old Unther Empire in order to prevent them falling into the hands of the god-king Gilgeam or the cult of Tiamat or someone worse.  
Isimud was frustrated that no benign group wanted to try to rule Unther. He was disposable to totally supporting a group of this kind.
