'''Willard Gooseford''' was a [[ranger]] who lived in the village of [[Snowmantle]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], having called the peaceful hamlet his home longer than anyone else.

==Description==
Willard was rather tall, at 6'2" (1.9 m), and had some trembling brought upon by old age. Despite this, he maintained his clever mind well into his golden years.

==Relationships==
The elderly Willard was the uncle of [[Lanseril Snowmantle]], the famed [[druid]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], on his [[human]] mother's side.

==History==
For many years, Willard operated the winery within Snowmantle, fermenting unique mushrooms from the nearby [[Border Forest]], which he barreled and sold to nearby Dalesfolk.

During the occupation of Snowmantle by [[Zhentilar]] forces after the year [[1355 DR]], Willard hid his keen mind and feigned a number of ailments to present himself in an entirely non-threatening manner to the [[Zhent]] slavers. When his nephew Lanseril was imprisoned within their home village, Willard took in his [[badger]] ally [[Lawrence]], and used the particularly intelligent animal to maintain communication with his nephew.

A month after the Zhent army and the entire village of Snowmantle was leveled by a [[nature elemental]] in [[1369 DR]], Willard, [[Juliana Saan]] and [[Walter Geddstone]] returned to their home in order to rebuild.
