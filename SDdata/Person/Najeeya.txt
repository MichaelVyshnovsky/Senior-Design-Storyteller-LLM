'''Najeeya''' was a student inhabiting the [[White Agate's Tower]] in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|79}}

==Activities==
In addition to her studies, Najeeya met with callers who came seeking answers from her master. She would hold follow-up meetings a week later and return with the desired answers.

She had her own room on the top floor of the tower.

==Relationships==
Najeeya was the most trusted pupil of the famous [[White Agate]]. As such, she was privileged to secret information regarding the vast treasures of the tower.

The White Agate kept a ''[[clone]]'' of Najeeya within his treasure vault in case she met an untimely end.
