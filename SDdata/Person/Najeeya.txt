Najeeya was a student inhabiting the White Agates Tower in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
In addition to her studies, Najeeya met with callers who came seeking answers from her master. She would hold follow-up meetings a week later and return with the desired answers.
She had her own room on the top floor of the tower.
Najeeya was the most trusted pupil of the famous White Agate. As such, she was privileged to secret information regarding the vast treasures of the tower.
The White Agate kept a clone of Najeeya within his treasure vault in case she met an untimely end.
