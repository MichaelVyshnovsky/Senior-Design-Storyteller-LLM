'''Gorin''' was an inhabitant of the [[Fortress of the Old Man]], and one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]]. He was, along with [[Valmir]], one of the few survivors of the night of [[Tarsakh 25]] who met up with [[Talieth]], [[Lewan]] and [[Ulaan]] after the three of them emerged from the [[Tower of the Sun]]. Though he was aware that [[Sauk]] was still inside, he preferred not to go check up on him.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||41}}
