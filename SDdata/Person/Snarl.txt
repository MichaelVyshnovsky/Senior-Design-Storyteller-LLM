Snarl was a wolf and the pet of the Cragmaw tribe chieftain, Grol, around 1491 DR.
Snarl was a powerful wolf, and was much more hardy than others of his species. He often attended King Grol in his personal quarters.
In 1491 DR, when the doppelganger disguised as a drow, Vyerith, confronted Grol, Snarl was present.
