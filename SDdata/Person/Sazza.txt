Sazza was a goblin that pledged her allegiance to the Cult of the Absolute.
The goblin had red hair worn in a side swept undercut. She wore clothing scraps with a feather pauldron and a belt adorned with small bones.
The zealous goblin was captured in a makeshift prison cell in the 15 century DR. The tiefling, Arka, wished to kill her. This, however, did not faze Sazza, as she believed she was blessed by the Absolute.
