Therlon was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
Per Storm Silverhands inside information on the War Wizards, he was a good sort and not quick to resort to dangerous spells.
Therlon was good on his local knowledge of the Hullack Forest and the zone around Tethgard. He personally knew some tracking and identifying spells, though they were not powerful enough to work in Tethgard after the Spellplague.
Therlon carried out reconnaissance for a band of War Wizards sent to kill or capture Elminster Aumar and the Simbul in the , after the first stole the Royal Gorget of Battle and the latter destroyed a village in a bout of madness. Therlon was not amongst the named survivors later.
