'''Jopi''' was a man who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He had an rather famous uncle who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[mage]] known as [[Ragefast]]. When he was young Jopi would affectionately refer to his uncle as Grumpleskin, often provoking the casting of a non-harmful spell in response.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Jopi made a trip along the [[Coast Way]] to visit his uncle at his home in the city. His journey took longer than expected due to the increased bandit activity that sprang up during the [[Iron crisis]] of that year. He made as stop over at the [[Friendly Arm]] inn to briefly avoid the perils of travel on the coast.
