Goldene Clover was a halfling resident of Eveningstar in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
Goldene had long, messy, dark-blonde hair, and wore a brown and white dress with a leather corset.
At the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Goldene found the influx of travelers and outsiders quite interesting, and badgered them about their origins.
