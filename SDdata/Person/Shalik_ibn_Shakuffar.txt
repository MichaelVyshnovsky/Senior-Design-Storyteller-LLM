'''Shalik ibn Shakuffar''' was a skilled [[sha'ir]] who created the ''[[Urn of the Blue Vishap]]'' for use as a [[genie prison]].{{Cite dragon/242/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magical Allies of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Setting}}

==History==
Shalik used the ''urn'' to trap a [[marid]] called Merifa of the Pearl Lagoons. The urn eventually traveled outside of [[Zakhara]], where the trapped marid was able to trick a [[blue dragon]] in changing places with her.
