Alchaia was the leading githyanki commander in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR. She was the ruler of Stardock until succeeded by Commander Urlon.
Sometime in the late 15 century DR,  Alchaia led a group of githyanki into the Crystal Labyrinth while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the Seadeeps level. Upon discovery of the portal leading to Stardock, they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche Kliir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected access to Stardock.
Around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Alchaia resided in Stardock.
Alchaia was in her quarters studying the manual of gainful exercise or the tome of clear thought she had recently found.
Alchaias mount was the loyal Zolcharrx, one of the daughters of Ashtyrranthor, who was her main ally. Her second-in-command Urlon plotted against her.
Alchaia was very cruel to her subordinates. She knew how to motivate her soldiers, by promising them the two magic books. Alchaia was worried about the githzerai Ezria her soldiers had recently captured, fearing that more would arrive.
