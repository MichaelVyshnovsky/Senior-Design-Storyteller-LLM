'''Al'chaia''' was the leading [[githyanki]] commander in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]]. She was the ruler of [[Stardock]] until succeeded by Commander [[Urlon]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Stardock Under Siege|76}}

==History==
Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century DR,  Al'chaia led a group of githyanki into the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the [[Seadeeps]] level. Upon discovery of the portal leading to [[Stardock]], they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche K'liir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected access to Stardock.

Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Al'chaia resided in Stardock.

==Activities==
Al'chaia was in her quarters studying the ''[[manual of gainful exercise]]'' or the ''[[tome of clear thought]]'' she had recently found.

==Relationships==
Al'chaia's mount was the loyal [[Zolcharrx]], one of the daughters of [[Ashtyrranthor]], who was her main ally. Her second-in-command [[Urlon]] plotted against her.

==Personality==
Al'chaia was very cruel to her subordinates. She knew how to motivate her soldiers, by promising them the two magic books. Al'chaia was worried about the [[githzerai]] [[Ezria]] her soldiers had recently captured, fearing that more would arrive.
