Leader of the Marstel trading house, '''Maroth''' was the Harmach of [[Hulburg]] in 1479 DR.  The shadowmage [[Rhovann]] dominated Maroth's will and turned him into his puppet.  When Maroth's mind became too enfeebled for him to function as the Harmach, Rhovann killed Maroth and replaced him with a construct.<br />
