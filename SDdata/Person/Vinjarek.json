        "Description": "The Mound King was a mysterious figure who was said to wield terrible plaguechanged powers.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|26}} His posture was stopped and he wore tattered [[chain mail]] and a [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[crown]] studded with [[gemstone]]s. He wielded a mighty sentient ''[[frostbrand]]'' [[broadsword]] known as ''[[Deepchill]]'', the scabbard for which had long since fallen apart.\n\nHis voice and laughter were raspy and hoarse.",
        "Personality": "The Mound King was cold and vengeful. and he found amusement in the futile attempts of [[cleric]]s to ''[[turn undead|turn]]'' him. While he delighted in draining the life from [[adventurer]]s who opposed him, he rarely pursued invaders within his lair, instead using his treasures to lure them into a trap.\n\nWhile he preferred solitude, he did not shy away from leading and coordinating his followers.",
        "Activities": "He spent much of his time sitting immobile upon his throne, accompanied by no more than three [[wight]] servants who acted as his messengers when he needed them, although his throne room became a hive of activity whenever his lair came under attack.\n\nVinjarek tolerated no competition for his position as great wight.",
        "Possessions": "Vinjarek's crown (valued at about 15,000 [[gp]]) had belonged to one of the rulers interred in the Tombs of Deckon Thar. Aside from the crown and ''Deepchill'', Vinjarek kept nothing of value on his person, however he had a treasure chamber located behind his small throne room beneath the greatest burial mound of the Tombs. As of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, his hoard contained about 13,250 gp worth of ingots, [[trade weight]]s, [[jewelry]], and coins, including a matched set of gems that had once been embedded in the scabbard of ''Deepchill''. The hoard also contained a number of [[magic item]]s, including a [[shield]], the tip of a [[spear]], a ''[[cursed berserking sword|cursed berserking]] [[longsword]]'' (which once belonged to a warlike bandit lord interred in the Tombs), a ''[[ring of spell turning]]'', and a ''[[brooch of shielding]]''. Much of this loot was scattered across the floor of the treasure chamber because the chests which had contained it had long since rotted away.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, his hoard was said to have grown to contain a vast amount of gold and [[magic]].",
