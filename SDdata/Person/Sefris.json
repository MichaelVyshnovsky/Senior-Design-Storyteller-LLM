She worked with the powers of the dead to bolster the life force of her allies. As such she was exceptionally loyal to her friends and traveling companions.\nShe was a member of an adventuring band along with the elven paladin Galea, the tiefling warlock Prosper, and the dragonborn barbarian Vrondiss."
