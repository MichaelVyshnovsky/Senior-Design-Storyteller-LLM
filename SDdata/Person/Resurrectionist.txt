The '''Resurrectionist''' was an elderly [[human]] man who dwelt in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was one of the city's few living inhabitants. 

==Description==
He was old and frail, and he dressed in a tattered [[cloak]] with a hood.

==Abilities==
The Resurrectionist claimed to be able to bring anyone back from the dead regardless of how damaged or ancient their remains (conditions which constrained normal rites of [[resurrection]]). He was generally willing to offer his services to revive someone who had died, but rather than [[money]], he only did so in exchange for some unspecified future favor or quest. Failure to fulfill whatever service he requested would cause the beneficiary of his resurrection [[magic]] to instantly drop dead, a fact that he did not keep secret.

==Activities==
Everyday he would peruse Evernight's [[Corpse Market]] for hours, inspecting (and occasionally sniffing) various body parts and always being audibly disappointed in whatever he found. If asked, he said he was looking for any trace of a friend whom he had lost long ago, and who he intended to resurrect despite them having been dead for far longer than a normal resurrection could accommodate. He refused to elaborate about this deceased friend, and seemed to perhaps not even know or remember any details about them.

==History==
As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, his activities had made him a minor celebrity at the Corpse Market.
