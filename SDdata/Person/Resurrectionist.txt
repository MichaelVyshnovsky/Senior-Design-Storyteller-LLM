The Resurrectionist was an elderly human man who dwelt in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR. He was one of the citys few living inhabitants. 
He was old and frail, and he dressed in a tattered cloak with a hood.
The Resurrectionist claimed to be able to bring anyone back from the dead regardless of how damaged or ancient their remains (conditions which constrained normal rites of resurrection). He was generally willing to offer his services to revive someone who had died, but rather than money, he only did so in exchange for some unspecified future favor or quest. Failure to fulfill whatever service he requested would cause the beneficiary of his resurrection magic to instantly drop dead, a fact that he did not keep secret.
Everyday he would peruse Evernights Corpse Market for hours, inspecting (and occasionally sniffing) various body parts and always being audibly disappointed in whatever he found. If asked, he said he was looking for any trace of a friend whom he had lost long ago, and who he intended to resurrect despite them having been dead for far longer than a normal resurrection could accommodate. He refused to elaborate about this deceased friend, and seemed to perhaps not even know or remember any details about them.
As of , his activities had made him a minor celebrity at the Corpse Market.
