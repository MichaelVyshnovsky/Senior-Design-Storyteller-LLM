'''Kuskyn Waelvor''' was an [[elven]] inhabitant of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], and the head of his house, [[Waelvor]].

==Reputation==
To [[Amaranthae Auglamyr]] in {{yearlink|241}}, should [[Symrustar Auglamyr]] tell him about Elandorr's attempts at wooing her, Kuskyn would be so distraught by his son wooing anyone, let alone someone of as low status as House [[Auglamyr]], that he'd cage [[Elandorr Waelvor]] immediately and for a long time. She also spoke of him using a spell-cage, suggesting he was known to be a wizard.
