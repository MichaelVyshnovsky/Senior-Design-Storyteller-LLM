'''Leluia Torlath''' was a royal daughter of the [[Amn]]ian [[Torlath]] dynasty in the 7{{th}} century.

==Relationships==
Leluia was the only daughter of King [[Brinnaq Torlath I|Brinnaq I]], with at least half a dozen brothers including [[Esmel Torlath IV|Esmel IV]] and [[Jhanos Torlath I|Jhanos I]]. She was married to [[Arbas]], to her family's misfortune.

==History==
Leluia's marriage to Arbas allowed him access to the royal court, and on the death of King Brinnaq I he proceeded to murder every male family member within reach. Her brother Esmel IV was poisoned shortly after becoming king, followed by his newborn son [[Esmar Torlath|Esmar]]. Having cleared the field, Arbas claimed the throne for himself, only to be slain within the year by her vengeful brother Jhanos I.
