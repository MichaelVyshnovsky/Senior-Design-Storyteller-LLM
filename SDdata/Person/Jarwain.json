        "mainbody": "Jarwain was the handsome and fiery-eyed halfâ€“moon elf proprietor of the shop Jarwains Imports in Ashabenford in the late 14 century DR.\nHe was an observant, charismatic man who had an eye for the finest of products in his shop and was extremely detail-oriented in his study of travelers and passers-by.\nSoft-spoken and observant, Jarwain kept his shop well-defended and well-stocked, but was also a man of secrets. He imported luxurious goods, including textiles and spices, from Cormyr via guarded caravans using a dangerous route that passed through Tilvers Gap and down the Moonsea Ride, a business deal he preferred not to disclose to others.\nIn actuality, Jarwain moonlighted as an agent for the Cult of the Dragon. He sold information on other caravans passing through Tilvers Gap to ensure the safety of his own."
