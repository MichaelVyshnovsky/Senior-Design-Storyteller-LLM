==Description==
Arik was a short man with a pudgy body. He spoke in a dull, hollow voice,{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}

==Personality==
Arik was quite a quiet man, often ignoring attempts to question him.

==History==
At some point in the Blood in the Vine's history, a traveler from late-15{{th}} century [[DR]] [[Toril]] by the name of [[Volothamp Geddarm]] came barging into the tavern, having sprinted there on the recommendation of [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]]. While there he struck up a conversation with Arik, who he mistook to be its owner. Arik regaled the man with the layout of the domain [[Barovia]], giving him the names of many notable locations one could find within it. And after Volo informed him that the tavern had been recommended by Ezmerelda, Arik suggested that he seek out a [[half-elf]] [[bard]] by the name of [[Rictavio]] on an island in [[Lake Baratok]].
