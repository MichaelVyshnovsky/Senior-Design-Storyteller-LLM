Koda Yoshiuji was a samurai who ran a posthouse or waystation in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
It was a very unhealthy posthouse. He led the posthouse with two servants.
Koda fell from grace and was sent to the posthouse, a place to send people out of favor, because he was a fanatical supporter of the Igi clan.
