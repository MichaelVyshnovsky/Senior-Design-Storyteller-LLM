'''Koda Yoshiuji''' was a [[samurai]] who ran a posthouse or waystation in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
It was a very unhealthy posthouse. He led the posthouse with two servants.

==Personality==
Koda fell from grace and was sent to the posthouse, a place to send people out of favor, because he was a fanatical supporter of the [[Igi clan]].
