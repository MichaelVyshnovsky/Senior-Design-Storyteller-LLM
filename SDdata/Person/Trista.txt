Trista the Shadowed was the court wizard of Daggerford around 1485 DR.
Trista was the court wizard from the death of her master Gwaereth the Gray, seventy years ago.
Trista had no patience for court politics or the niceties of courtly etiquette. However, she asked respect from younger people. She was brash, outspoken, and extremely opinionated, but not malicious or wantonly destructive.
Trista was feared both in the castle and in the town by all. Her only friend was Lady Morwen Daggerford and the two discussed local history for hours.
