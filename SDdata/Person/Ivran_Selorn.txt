Ivran Selorn was an inhabitant of Myth Drannor in the 3 century DR.
He had at least one spell to track Elminster.
To Elminster, he was blood-hungry. Before his slaying, however, he named the deaths of Symrustar Auglamyr and two others as the reason for his hunt.
He carried at least one blade.
In , he was present at the revel where Elminster Aumar substituted for Coronal Eltargrim. Against the wishes of his sire, he took a scrap of cloth and decided to track Elminster with it, starting the hunt for the prince.
During the hunt, he threw his blade at Elminster, believing him to have killed a number of people at the revel it was rebounded. He was killed soon after by another reflected swarm of swords.
