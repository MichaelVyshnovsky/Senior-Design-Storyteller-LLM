'''Ivran Selorn''' was an inhabitant of [[Myth Drannor]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
He had at least one spell to track Elminster.

==Personality==
To Elminster, he was blood-hungry. Before his slaying, however, he named the deaths of [[Symrustar Auglamyr]] and two others as the reason for his hunt.

==Possessions==
He carried at least one blade.

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, he was present at the revel where [[Elminster Aumar]] substituted for [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]]. Against the wishes of his sire, he took a scrap of cloth and decided to track Elminster with it, starting the hunt for the prince.

During the hunt, he threw his blade at Elminster, believing him to have killed a number of people at the revel; it was rebounded. He was killed soon after by another reflected swarm of swords.
