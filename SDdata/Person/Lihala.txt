'''Lihala''' was a musician who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was described as a joyous, loving individual who demonstrated true grace.

==Abilities==
Lihala was a talented musician and dedicated teacher. She loved to dance but had little talent for it.

==Relationships==
She had one very promising student, [[Alfira]], who absolutely adored Lihala and their close bond.

==History==
Some time during the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lihala and Alfira were traveling near the [[Risen Road]] when they were beset by a pack of [[gnoll]]s. They did not hear the fearsome creatures begin their attack, and unfortunately Lihala paid the ultimate price. Fortunately, Alfira managed to get away and return to safety at the [[Emerald Grove]].

Some time later, Alfira began to write a song to honor her fallen friend and mentor, entitled ''[[The Weeping Dawn]]''.
