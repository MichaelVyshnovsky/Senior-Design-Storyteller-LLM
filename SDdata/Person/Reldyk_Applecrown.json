        "mainbody": "Reldyk Applecrown was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR. The Chosen of Mystra, Elminster Aumar, later borrowed his body.\nHe was young and pleasant-looking, though not overly handsome.\nHe didnt have much of a personality left after the fight against Xarlandralath.\nReldyk Applecrown was one of the lesser War Wizards.\nHe was a War Wizard.\nHis comatose body was later yielded up to Elminster Aumar.\nReldyk Applecrown had taken some damage during the fight against Xarlandralath, but the worst of his injuries was mental after hed been caught in some magical backlash, which had left him comatose and experiencing occassional seizures. It was in this state that Vangerdahast offered his body to Elminster, the Chosen of Mystra, who was in turn without a body after a beholder attack. With some magic, Elminster took possession of Reldyk Applecrowns body.\nElminster used Reldyk Applecrowns body to accompany Lady Darlethra Greatgaunt, actually a disguised Storm Silverhand, the Marchioness Immerdusk, in her walks to and fro all over the city. He later used the same body still to pursue after Morligul Downdagger after he kidnapped one of the Lords of Waterdeep, his friend Mirt, believing him to be actually Rauligus Helderstone, whom he was impersonating at the time.\nHe continued to wear that body for a bit, until while trying to lure the blueflame ghosts to the Bold Blazon, he got caught in the crossfire after the War Wizards turned up. He bodily blocked one of Glathra Barcantles spells on Storm Silverhand, getting Reldyk Applecrowns body completely annihilated in the process."
