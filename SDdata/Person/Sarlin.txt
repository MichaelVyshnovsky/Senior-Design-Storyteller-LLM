'''Sarlin''', also known as '''Sarlin the Supreme''', was a malevolent [[wizard]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Sarlin knew to keep to an agreement in the face of temptation. He was, nonetheless, an evil sorcerer.

==Possessions==
Sarlin's hut was at most three days away from [[Elminster's Tower]]. In {{yearlink|1365}}, he acquired the ''[[Ring of Murbrand]]''.As Tarth Hornwood asks for a few days, he takes at most a tenday. Since four days are needed to duplicate the staff, the trips to and from Elminster's tower may have taken at most three days each.

==History==
In late [[Mirtul]] of {{yearlink|1360}}, Sarlin had fallen on hard times when he was visited by [[Tarth Hornwood]], on whom he had played some trick at a prior time. He agreed to create a false duplicate of Tarth Hornwood's ''[[Nimra Ninehands|staff]]'' in exchange for the ''Ring of Murbrand'', a task he believed would take him four days. It was completed successfully, and he acquired the ring.
