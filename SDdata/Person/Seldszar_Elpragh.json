        "mainbody": "Seldszar Elpragh was a drow diviner the head of the College of Divination and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the late 14 century DR.\nSeldszar became the Master of his college around 1177 DR. Upon becoming Master, he learned the secret about Sshamaths faerzress it was cast by the first Master of Divination, Chaldzar, and the powerful conjurer Yithzin.\nBy 1377 DR, Seldszar was the patron of Qarlynd Melarn, who was about to start his new College of Ancient Arcana. Qarlynd recommended to the priestess of Eilistraee Miverra to trust only Seldszar when discussing a strange magical phenomena that had affected both wizards and priests. Thus, Miverra and Seldszar spoke about a magical phenomena that involved surges in the faerzress spreading from the main temple of Kiaransalee. At last, they decided that a joint force of Eilistraees priests and wizards of the College of Divination, including Qarlynd and Seldszars son Eldrinn Elpragh, would scout the temple of Kiaransalee. After speaking with Miverra, Seldszar Elpragh informed the Master of Conjuration Urlryn Khalazza of his discoveries about the faerzresss problems and Urlryn said hed received the same information from a cleric of Vhaeraun from Skullport, who was actually an agent instructed to deliver the same message as Miverra.\nAfter the mission in Velddrinnsshar, the faerzress did not surge anymore, but its intensity didnt diminish to its previous level either. This weakened the College of Divination, since casting a divination produced faerie fire, giving away the use of magic and also hindering the use of divination magic altogether.\nIn the , Seldszar formally asked the Conclave to elevate Qarlynd as a new member, making him Master of Ancient Arcana. Later, he met with Masters Urlryn Khalazza, Masoj Dhuunyl, and Qarlynd Melarn and they involved Masoj in their plan to strip the faerzress from the drow. Together with Qarlynds apprentices, his son and the Masters Urlryn and Masoj, Seldszar helped Qarlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonais blood into dark elves. Afterward, they all relocated to Rhymanthiin, thanks to Seldszars secret dealings with the sharn."
