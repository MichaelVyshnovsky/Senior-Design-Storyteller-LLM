        "mainbody": "'''Seldszar Elpragh''' was a [[drow]] [[diviner]] the head of the [[College of Divination]] and one of the members of the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Seldszar became the Master of his college around [[1177 DR]]. Upon becoming Master, he learned the secret about Sshamath's ''[[faerzress]]'': it was cast by the first Master of Divination, [[Chal'dzar]], and the powerful [[conjurer]] [[Yithzin]].\n\nBy [[1377 DR]], Seldszar was the patron of [[Q'arlynd Melarn]], who was about to start his new [[College of Ancient Arcana]]. Q'arlynd recommended to the priestess of [[Eilistraee]] [[Miverra]] to trust only Seldszar when discussing a strange magical phenomena that had affected both wizards and priests. Thus, Miverra and Seldszar spoke about a magical phenomena that involved surges in the ''faerzress'' spreading from the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]]. At last, they decided that a joint force of Eilistraee's priests and wizards of the College of Divination, including Q'arlynd and Seldszar's son [[Eldrinn Elpragh]], would scout the temple of Kiaransalee. After speaking with Miverra, Seldszar Elpragh informed the Master of Conjuration [[Urlryn Khalazza]] of his discoveries about the ''faerzress''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s problems and Urlryn said he'd received the same information from a cleric of [[Vhaeraun]] from [[Skullport]], who was actually an agent instructed to deliver the same message as Miverra.\n\nAfter the mission in [[V'elddrinnsshar]], the ''faerzress'' did not surge anymore, but its intensity didn't diminish to its previous level either. This weakened the College of Divination, since casting a divination produced ''faerie fire'', giving away the use of magic and also hindering the use of divination magic altogether.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, Seldszar formally asked the Conclave to elevate Q'arlynd as a new member, making him Master of Ancient Arcana. Later, he met with Masters [[Urlryn Khalazza]], [[Masoj Dhuunyl]], and Q'arlynd Melarn and they involved Masoj in their plan to strip the ''faerzress'' from the drow. Together with Q'arlynd's apprentices, his son and the Masters Urlryn and Masoj, Seldszar helped Q'arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into [[dark elves]]. Afterward, they all relocated to [[Rhymanthiin]], thanks to Seldszar's secret dealings with the [[sharn]]."
