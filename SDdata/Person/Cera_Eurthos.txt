'''Cera''' was the head priestess of [[Amaunator]] in the town of [[Soolabax]] in [[Chessenta]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, she aided [[Aoth Fezim]] in uncovering [[Alasklerbanbastos]]'s plans to attack Chessenta, although she believed that Amaunator wanted her to uncover an even bigger plot.

After Alasklerbanbastos' physical form was destroyed in the second battle of the war with [[Threskel]], she resurrected his soul into the body of a young [[blue dragon]]. Because Cera controlled his [[phylactery]], she was able to exert some control over Alasklerbanbastos. Cera and Aoth traveled together to [[Akanûl]] to talk the Akanûlans out of joining forces with [[Tchazzar]]'s army. Cera compelled Alasklerbanbastos to follow but he was finally able to slip out of her control and regain his phylactery. During the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], Cera rescued the clergy of Amaunator and other legitimate gods who were held prisoner by the Church of [[Tiamat]] and led the attack against Alasklerbanbastos.
