'''Trodinn Deepstone''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] blacksmith for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Trodinn Deepstone spent the entirety of his long life with a [[hammer]] in hand, ablaze by the heat of blacksmithing furnaces. Despite that, Trodinn had never grew tired of such labor. He was truly happy working the metal into quality [[weapon]]s. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Trodinn was working in the city of Neverwinter, offering his services to adventurers and city defenders.
