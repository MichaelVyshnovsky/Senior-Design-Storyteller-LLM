'''Samia al-Sa'id''' was the [[elven]] khedive of [[Rog'osto]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Samia's [[enlightenment|enlightened]] progressive rule endeared her to her subjects.

==Activities==
Samia had been the khedive of Rog'osto for 100 years as of 1367 DR. She spent much of her time settling disputes between the tower lords of the city, as well as serving as a buffer for the greedy representatives from [[Afyal]] and the [[Cities of the Pantheon]].

In addition to her political activities, Samia was a skilled [[sha'ir]] who collected an impressive array of [[magic item]]s over the years.
