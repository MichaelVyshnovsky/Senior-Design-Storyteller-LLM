        "mainbody": "'''Melkhor Goldseeker''' was a [[dwarf]] businessman on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the owner of [[Angelhead Mine]].\n{{quote|Heed well some hard-won advice: avoid trading in bandit territories.|Melkhor Goldseeker}}",
        "History": "Melkhor was an enterprising dwarf who in the late 1470s DR opened some mines in the hills behind [[Raven Cliff Beach]] near [[Cragmire Keep]], north of [[Neverwinter]]. However, they were in the territory of the [[Blackdagger Bandits]], who demanded from Melkhor a large cut of the profits to leave the mines alone. Otherwise, they cared little for mining and the mines had no other value to them. Melkhor agreed to the deal with the Blackdaggers.\n\nHowever, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Melkhor's miners uncovered ancient ruins and statues in Angelhead Mine. The Blackdaggers believed they could find treasure too, broke their deal with Melkhor, and refused to make another. The Blackdaggers raided Melkhor's wagons and the [[gnoll]] leader [[Krag Foultooth]] and his bandits assaulted Angelhead, imprisoned and enslaved the miners and took Melkhor's niece Mira hostage to ensure his silence and cooperation. [[Marion Hexbane]], meanwhile, sent some of her men to the Broken Crown to apply their new leverage on Melkhor. Fearing his business ruined and niece threatened, Melkhor gave up hope until an [[adventurer]] sent by [[Xalliana]] to investigate came to him. Though he first tried to deny it, he admitted what had happened and asked the adventurer to check the wagons and go to the mining base camp to learn what had happened. They found caravan survivors [[Yates]], [[Bazoril Gimlode]], and others holed at some of the ruins of [[Cragmire Keep]]; Yates explained what had happened and the adventurer was able to kill Foultooth, liberate the mine and miners, and rescue Mira. Melkhor was pleased to learn she was safe.",
        "Relationships": "He had a niece, [[Mira Thamros]], who was foreman of the mine."
