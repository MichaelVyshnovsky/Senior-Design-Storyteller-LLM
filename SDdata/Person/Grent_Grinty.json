        "Description": "Grent was a male [[gold dwarf]] with a clean-shaven face, pale skin, and blue eyes. He wore a simple commoner's duster and a large hat.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the cityâ€”[[Lord Gortash]]. Grent Grinty eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.'' [[Augur Harxkellan]] was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers in the Lower City. Grent Grinty was among the loyalists in the crowd, calling Baldur's Gate Lord Gortash's city."
