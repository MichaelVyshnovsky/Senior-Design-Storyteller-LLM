{{quote|''If you can't find a friend in this place, you're just not looking hard enough. Words to live by, my friend.''|Demetira Landscraper on the Happy Cow.}}

==Description==
Demetira was a short stout demihuman woman with red hair. Her body language, shrewd mannerisms, and wide smile telegraphed her mercantile trade.

==Personality==
Demetira Landscraper was a friendly face popular among the regulars of the Happy Cow. She knew almost every regular customer and considered them to be friends.

She often consumed Fulbar's alcohol and advertised her favorite [[Knee-Cracker]] [[cider]] to the inn's guest's.

==Relationships==
Apart from countless friends gained via her affability, Demetira personally knew Duke [[Pwyll Daggerford]] during his many visits to the Happy Cow. The Duke was well liked and he used those moments to talk to his subjects and stay on top of the Daggerford's rumor mill. Unlike Pwyll, his temporary successor [[Matagar Bugo]] was disliked by farmers and by Demetira herself.

==History==
In 1372 DR, Demetira Landscraper could be often seen mingling with the guests of the Happy Cow. She considered the regulars of the establishment her friends and easily built personal relationships with them. She came to know the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who aided the city during the [[Zhentarim]] takeover plot of 1372 DR, often calling the Hero's adventuring party her friends.

During the Hero's investigation of Duke Daggerford's seeming death, Demetira Landscraper revealed that she accompanied him on the faithful hunting trip that was assumed to be Duke's doom. She was asked to join the hunting trip and take care of the fancy [[ale]] kegs from the Cow that the Duke ordered along. She did not witness Pwyll's death but saw his dead body and his [[boar-spear]] that was obviously tampered with. However, she did not know what happened to the Duke's body afterward.

Her home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along [[Horse Way]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
