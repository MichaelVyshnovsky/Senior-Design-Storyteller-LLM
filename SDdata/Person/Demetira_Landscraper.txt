Demetira Landscraper was the manager of the Happy Cow inn in Daggerford who helped Fulbar Hardcheese running the business, purchasing, and accounting circa 1372 DR.
Demetira was a short stout demihuman woman with red hair. Her body language, shrewd mannerisms, and wide smile telegraphed her mercantile trade.
Demetira Landscraper was a friendly face popular among the regulars of the Happy Cow. She knew almost every regular customer and considered them to be friends.
She often consumed Fulbars alcohol and advertised her favorite Knee-Cracker cider to the inns guests.
Apart from countless friends gained via her affability, Demetira personally knew Duke Pwyll Daggerford during his many visits to the Happy Cow. The Duke was well liked and he used those moments to talk to his subjects and stay on top of the Daggerfords rumor mill. Unlike Pwyll, his temporary successor Matagar Bugo was disliked by farmers and by Demetira herself.
In 1372 DR, Demetira Landscraper could be often seen mingling with the guests of the Happy Cow. She considered the regulars of the establishment her friends and easily built personal relationships with them. She came to know the Hero of Daggerford who aided the city during the Zhentarim takeover plot of 1372 DR, often calling the Heros adventuring party her friends.
During the Heros investigation of Duke Daggerfords seeming death, Demetira Landscraper revealed that she accompanied him on the faithful hunting trip that was assumed to be Dukes doom. She was asked to join the hunting trip and take care of the fancy ale kegs from the Cow that the Duke ordered along. She did not witness Pwylls death but saw his dead body and his boar-spear that was obviously tampered with. However, she did not know what happened to the Dukes body afterward.
Her home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along Horse Way.
