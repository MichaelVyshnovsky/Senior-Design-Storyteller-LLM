        "mainbody": "'''Corran D'Arcey''' was a noble-born [[paladin]] son of Baron [[Ethelred D'Arcey]] of [[Sarshel]] who was a member of the [[Veiled Ones]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Even though he was not as big and imposing as his fellow Veiled One, [[Durwyn]], Corran D'Arcey was still quite formidable at {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}} tall. His eyes were gray, often advertising his cold and steely personality. His eyes darkened, and facial features were contorted with rage as he battled forces of evil. It all, however, melted away into serenity during his prayers or giving medical aid to his companions. When he answered a call from [[Elminster]], Corran was still a young man of only twenty-three years old.\n\nHe usually wore a simple [[helmet]] that covered his short black hair, and he proudly displayed the ''[[holy symbol]]'' of [[Tyr]] which he wore above his heavy armor around his neck.",
        "Personality": "Even though he was young when the circumstances plunged him into adventure, he already was overly confident of himself, his calling to serve Tyr, and the righteousness of his opinions. Born into nobility, his upbringing and privilege made him blind to the struggles of others, and charity was simply something to brag about and feel superior over.\n\nMany of his morals were informed by romanticized ideas of honor, and these notions and life outlook were never challenged until his adventures in Myth Drannor among the Veiled Ones. His outlooks slowly became more grounded in reality and informed by moral complexity as well as his constant interactions and conflicts with [[Kestrel]], a rogue and an extremely practical and levelheaded woman.",
        "Abilities": "As a paladin, Corran could ''[[detect evil]]'', provide small amounts of healing via divine magic, cure [[disease]]s, inspire his comrades with the ''aura of courage'', as well as ''[[turn undead]]'' and ''smite evil''. As part of his training, he was taught to handle most simple and martial weapons and fight in all types of armor.\n\nHe was a skilled healer and was a capable diplomat. However, that particular skill was often undermined by his personal biases and disdain for [[rogue]]s and perceived evil and chaos.\n\nBeing raised in a noble family, he had knowledge of nobility-related, and religious topics. His upbringing also taught him [[Elven language|elven]], [[Orc language|orcish]], and [[celestial language]]s.",
        "Possessions": "His gear of note during the adventures in [[Myth Drannor]] included a masterfully crafted [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[plate armor]], a large [[steel]] ''+2'' [[enchanted]] ''[[shield of necromantic spell turning]]'', a [[silver]] [[longsword]] with a ''+2'' enchantment he named the ''[[Pathfinder (sword)|Pathfinder]]'', and a ''holy symbol'' of Tyr.",
        "Relationships": "Corran's indoctrination into rigid morals often led him to assume default leadership as he did with the Veiled Ones. However, his leadership was guided by idealism, lack of experience, and bullheaded bravado that led to the death of [[Emmeric]]. This often brought him to butt heads with Kestrel. The fact that the woman was a rogue made the antagonism even worse.\n\nCorran respected Durwyn's strength in battle and [[Ghleanna Stormlake]]'s magical prowess. In return, they accepted the paladin's de facto leadership in the group's initial outing. However, in Kestrel's opinion, the man needed to learn humility.",
        "History": "Corran was the third son born to Baron Ethelred D'Arcey, the patriarch of the long line of paladins, [[D'Arcey]] noble family of Sarshel. The Baron and all of his sons were devote followers of Tyr's dogma as per the family tradition. Thus Corran absorbed the [[Tyran]] doctrine from the cradle, cementing his molars and faith early on. He grew up knowing his place in life and his duties to become a paladin of his deity.\n\nStarting from an early age, Corran received military training at a neighboring noble's estate, Baron [[Artur Gheinte]]'s as was the tradition between the two families to train each other's heirs. The religious training was provided by the local Sarshel temple of Tyr. In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, at the age of sixteen, Corran took his paladin vows and subsequently participated in several military campaigns against monster invaders of [[Impiltur]]. However, despite his accomplishments, he felt overshadowed by the family's legacy and his father and brothers' names. To prove himself, Corran decided to leave lmpiltur to find a way of serving Tyr on his own terms, growing himself worthy of his family name and his god.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Corran D'Arcey heard the murmurs of ''[[pool of radiance]]'' reawakening in [[Phlan]] of the [[Moonsea]] and without hesitation he volunteered himself to the just cause."
