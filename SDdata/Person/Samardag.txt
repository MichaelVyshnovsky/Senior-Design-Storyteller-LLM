Samardag the Hoper was a merchant on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Samardag, loyal to his moniker, always saw the good side of each situation. For him, the sky was always blue, the weather was always fine, and tomorrow would always be a better day. He could have been rich if not for his soft heart that led him to help anyone with a pitiful story.
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons in 1489 Samardag attached his wagon full of fragile porcelain to a great caravan that, unbeknownst to him, was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
