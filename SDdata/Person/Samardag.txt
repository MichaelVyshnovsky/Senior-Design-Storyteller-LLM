'''Samardag the Hoper''' was a merchant on the [[Sword Coast]] just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==Personality==
Samardag, loyal to his moniker, always saw the good side of each situation. For him, the sky was always blue, the weather was always fine, and tomorrow would always be a better day. He could have been rich if not for his soft heart that led him to help anyone with a pitiful story.

==History==
At the start of the [[Tyranny of Dragons]] in [[1489 DR|1489]] Samardag attached his wagon full of fragile porcelain to a great caravan that, unbeknownst to him, was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]].
