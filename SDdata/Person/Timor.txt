'''Timor "the Scar"''' was a member of the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company in [[Tethyr]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Timor wore a sparse black beard. He received his nickname from the nasty red scars that marked him from the corner of his right eye down his cheek and neck.

==Personality==
Usually, Timor was friendly and exuberant.

==History==
Timor hailed from a village near the [[Forest of Mir]], like all his companions in the Shields.

On [[Uktar 8]], 1370 DR, the Shields of the Highland lost two of their members, including Timor's own younger brother, Dumax, while guarding a caravan. Unexpected cold weather led to snow, and a band of fourteen [[gnoll]]s were able to track them and attack them, killing two of them during the ensuing battle.

At dusk two days later, Timor and the other three survivors went to the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]] to grieve their loss. Timor was completely depressed from his loss and constantly murmured.

Later that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for Dumax. This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland. When [[Bramas Thorntree]], another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the ''scepter'', Timor, [[Karr]], and [[Vajal]] got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer [[mug]]s and swinging their chairs. Timor's mug struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the [[Company of the Anvil]] used this as an opportunity to escape with the ''scepter''.
