Timor "the Scar" was a member of the Shields of the Highland adventuring company in Tethyr in 1370 DR.
Timor wore a sparse black beard. He received his nickname from the nasty red scars that marked him from the corner of his right eye down his cheek and neck.
Usually, Timor was friendly and exuberant.
Timor hailed from a village near the Forest of Mir, like all his companions in the Shields.
On Uktar 8, 1370 DR, the Shields of the Highland lost two of their members, including Timors own younger brother, Dumax, while guarding a caravan. Unexpected cold weather led to snow, and a band of fourteen gnolls were able to track them and attack them, killing two of them during the ensuing battle.
At dusk two days later, Timor and the other three survivors went to the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth to grieve their loss. Timor was completely depressed from his loss and constantly murmured.
Later that night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for Dumax. This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland. When Bramas Thorntree, another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the scepter, Timor, Karr, and Vajal got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer mugs and swinging their chairs. Timors mug struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the Company of the Anvil used this as an opportunity to escape with the scepter.
