'''Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed''' was the [[dragonborn]] patriarch of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]] in the late years of the 15th century [[DR]], until his death in [[1486 DR]]. He was a direct descendant of [[Khorsaya]].

==Description==
According to [[Anala]], [[Dumuzi]], and [[Tarhun]], Pandjed was a look-alike of his son, [[Mehen]].

==Personality==
Pandjed was an aggressive individual, prone to fits of rage.

==Abilities==
Pandjed could breathe lightning.

==Relationships==
Pandjed was the elder brother of Anala, and the father of Mehen.

==History==
Around [[1450 DR]], Pandjed exiled his scion, Mehen, because he had a gay relationship with his clanmate, [[Verthisathurgiesh Arjhani]], and didn't want to marry [[Kepeshkmolik Uadjit]].

The situation worsened when Pandjed began to exile from the clan nearly anyone who annoyed him, greatly damaging his clan's reputation in [[Thymari]] society.

In [[1486 DR]], Pandjed died of a heart attack.
