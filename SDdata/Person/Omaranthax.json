Its gray body was covered in blue spellscars. When seriously injured, Omaranthax transformed further and its eye extended out of its body on a stalk.\nLike others of its kind, Omaranthax was self-obsessed and dishonest. It had a habit of referring to itself in the third person. It was also single-minded about its transformation.\nOrmaranthax had been a foe of the Keepers of the Celestian Order for many years.\nIt was served by many foulspawn minions and a trio of warped gas spores.\nIn the , Omaranthax performed a ritual using the magic of the Plaguewrought Land in an attempt to gain power. However, it lost control of the ritual and violently mutated into a new form. Ormaranthax was pursued into the Thornwood by the Black Arrows, a group of the Keepers of the Celestian Order, where it barricaded itself into a cave along with its minions."
