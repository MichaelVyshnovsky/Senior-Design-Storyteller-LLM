        "mainbody": "Nalavarauthatoryl or Nalavara, formerly the elf wizard Lorelei Alavara, was an elf-dragon who sought vengeance against the kingdom of Cormyr.\nLorelei Alavara was the betrothed of Thatoryl Elian, an elf hunter of the Wolf Woods. When he was murdered by Andar Obarskyr—the first elf in the region ever murdered by human hands—Alavara persuaded Iliphar Nelnueve, Lord of Scepters, to help her take revenge against human settlers. Despite earning Iliphars respect and alliance when he and Andars brother Ondeth first met, around 1000 humans were killed by elven hands before the elves grew tired of Loreleis warmongering and, over a century since Elians death, banished her to the Stonelands. She maintained her quest for vengeance on the Obarskyr name and all humans in Cormyr.The adventure Into the Dragons Lair states that Lorelei Alavaras beloved was killed by \"the first king of Cormyr\", whereas the novel Death of the Dragon specifies that it was Andar Obarskyr, uncle of Faerlthann, who did it. Asked about this at the REALMS-L Mailing List, [https//web.archive.org/web/20150131025937/http//oracle.wizards.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0010c&L=realms-l&D=1&F=&S=&P=3959 here], Sean K. Reynolds explained that he had to share a single rough draft of the novel with three other people and that bit of information probably got lost for that reason.\nIn 116 DR, a group of five Cormyrean wizards cast binding spells, specifically keyed to the elf-dragon, and imprisoned her in the Grodd demiplane. In the casting, two of the wizards gave their lives to empower the final words of the spell. In the process, several of Nalavaras companions were also cast into a parallel dimension.\nShe was later freed by the magic of Vangerdahast, Cormyrs Royal Wizard. She brought with her the Grodd goblins, a tribe of goblins from the city of Grodd. She was also responsible for the creation of ghazneths from the long-dead members of the royal family who had betrayed Cormyr in some way. She was the primary force behind the Goblin War. In 1371 DR, Nalavara and King Azoun IV fought and finally killed each other."
