Glarald Starym was an elven inhabitant of Cormanthyr in the 3 century DR.
He had one of the forbidden enchantments hidden in Felaern Staryms tomb, which allowed him to control wands and scepters from afar. He altered it so that he could also control minds. Another of his abilities allowed him to change peoples bodies.
Prior to 241 DR, Glarald Starym took an enchantment from Felaern Staryms tomb and adapted it to control a number of minds from a distance. He used that magic to control Alais Dree and two unicorns, then using sorcery to alter Alais Drees body shape to better suit his tastes.
In , Glarald Starym was approached by the Srinshee as a possible herald of Cormanthyr. However, while he accepted, his mind was read as part of the process when he learned of something theyd discovered, he attacked the Srinshee and Earynspieir. Amongst other things, he used Alais Dree and two unicorns as weapons through forbidden magic. After the Srinshee broke his thrall, they turned on him. He barely survived, and was kept afterwards at Thurdans Tree, wounded in his wits.
