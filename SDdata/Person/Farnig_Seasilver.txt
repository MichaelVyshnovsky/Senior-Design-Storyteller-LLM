'''Farnig Seasilver''', nicknamed '''Farnig the Feckless''', was the grand duke of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He had hair the color of [[copper]].

==Personality==
Farnig was something of a coward, taking actions to ensure the safety of himself and his family rather than his subjects.

==Possessions==
Among his great wealth and many possessions, was a suit of [[gold]]en armor.

==Relationships==
He was the husband of Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]] and the father of [[Arietta Seasilver]], the [[Chosen]] of [[Siamorphe]].

The Grand Duke was served well by his household guards, led by Sergeant [[Carlton]],
and his majordomo [[Greymace]].

==History==
On [[Uktar 2]] of the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, the city of Marsember was ordered to evacuate in response to the coming assault of Cormyr at the hands of the [[Shadovar]] of [[Netheril]]. Rather than lead his people, Grand Duke Farnig ordered his family to discreetly leave the city aboard their ship, the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]''.

After he and his wife boarded the ship, the grand duke was cut down by [[Yder Tanthul]], one of the twelve Princes of Shade.
