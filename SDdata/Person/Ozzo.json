        "mainbody": "Ozzo was a charmed ogre giant who lived in the fortress of Krak al-Niraan in 1367 DR.\nJamal al-Yindannim used his powers to charm Ozzo into serving the Brotherhood of the True Flame as a brutishly dangerous guard. Ozzo inhabited a large chamber found near the postern of the keep. Anyone entering this area unaccompanied by Jamal, whom Ozzo considered to be his best friend, risked being violently smashed.\nOzzo was carefully monitored by 24 fedayeen at all times, perhaps as a safeguard in case the magic keeping the large brute under control failed. Any intruder lucky or skilled enough to breach Ozzos chamber was attacked by 23 of the fedayeen while the remaining guard alerted the rest of the keep."
