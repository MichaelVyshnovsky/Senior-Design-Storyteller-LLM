King '''Rashturl Torlath''' "the Watchful" was an early [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Torlath]] dynasty who developed a heroic reputation as a general.

==Relationships==
Rashturl was the third son of King [[Corl Torlath II|Corl II]], and inherited the throne from him. His sole son [[Brinnaq Torlath I|Brinnaq  I]] later became king himself.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|661}}, the [[ogre magi]] called the [[Horned Mage]] united the [[ogre]]s of the [[Small Teeth]] and [[Cloud Peaks]], forming an army that sacked the towns of [[Imnescar]] and [[Trademeet]]. Before they could lay siege to [[Esmeltaran]] and claim the [[Armory of Nedeheim]], Rashturl raised an army and led it against the invaders, defeating them and sending the Horned Mage into hiding.

King Rashturl's fame was so great that his name was given to the [[Citadel of Rashturl]] in [[897 DR]],
