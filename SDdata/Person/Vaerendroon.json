        "mainbody": "'''Vaerendroon''' was a skilled [[wizard]] and [[sage]] of magical lore who lived during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "He was known to trade magic for specific [[spell]] that he was eager to possess. He often dealt with apprentices of other powerful mages in order to gain access to unique spells. Vaerendroon compiled his collected knowledge within a [[tome]] called ''[[Vaerendroon's Ineffable Enchantments]]'' and sold the volume for 90,000 [[gp]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] when he needed coin badly."
