        "mainbody": "Ali al-Lazan was a powerful human flame mage and member of the Brotherhood of the True Flame in Zakhara.\nAli was a balding middle-aged man who stood  tall. He used the word \"burn\" in just about every sentence. His appearance was changed via a seeming spell when he went out in public since he was a wanted man for arson.\nHe owned a wand of fire, a sash of fire resistance, a ring of protection, a ring of free action, a fireproofed bag of holding, 12 star pots, 12 smoke spheres, a potion of flying, and a potion of fire breath.\nAli attempted to incinerate the royal palace of Sultana Alurah bint Asrah of Hiyal. Though he failed, his actions prompted the Sultana to issue a 500,000-gp bounty on his head for his capture and return to Hiyal. If returned dead, the Sultana wished for his body to be in a condition from which he could be raised.\nJamal al-Yindannim offered shelter to Ali within the fortress of Krak al-Niraan. Jamal appointed Ali as his Chief Inquisitor where his erratic and violent behavior could be put to use.\nAli was born in Huzuz to a rich silk merchant family. He became obsessed with flames by the age of five. He set one of his fathers wives on fire in her sleep at the age of twelve after getting tired of hearing how she berated his father. He then stole a large sum of coin from his fathers estate before burning it to the ground. Ali traveled to Qadib where he studied flame magic and eventually joined the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\nAlis hatred of women, particularly those in positions of power over men, grew as he aged. He burned a female qadis house to the ground and only escaped justice because of the Brotherhood. After that incident he spent most of his time within a Brotherhood stronghold in the Haunted Lands, developing his expertise in flame magic. He would teleport to a city whenever boredom caught up with him in order to start fires."
