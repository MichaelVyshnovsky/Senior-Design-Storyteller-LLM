        "Description": "Ali was a balding middle-aged man who stood {{SI|5'6|'\"|c|long=yes}} tall. He used the word \"burn\" in just about every sentence. His appearance was changed via a ''[[seeming]]'' [[spell]] when he went out in public since he was a wanted man for arson.",
        "Possessions": "He owned a ''[[wand of fire]]'', a ''[[sash of fire resistance]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of free action]]'', a fireproofed ''[[bag of holding]]'', 12 ''[[star pot]]s, 12 ''[[smoke sphere]]s'', a ''[[potion of flying]]'', and a ''[[potion of fire breath]]''.",
        "History": "Ali was born in [[Huzuz]] to a rich [[silk]] merchant family. He became obsessed with flames by the age of five. He set one of his father's wives on fire in her sleep at the age of twelve after getting tired of hearing how she berated his father. He then stole a large sum of coin from his father's estate before burning it to the ground. Ali traveled to [[Qadib]] where he studied [[Flame (province)|flame]] magic and eventually joined the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\n\nAli's hatred of women, particularly those in positions of power over men, grew as he aged. He burned a female ''[[Midani dictionary|qadi]]'s'' house to the ground and only escaped justice because of the Brotherhood. After that incident he spent most of his time within a Brotherhood stronghold in the [[Haunted Lands]], developing his expertise in flame magic. He would ''[[teleport]]'' to a city whenever boredom caught up with him in order to start fires.",
        "Activites": "[[Jamal al-Yindannim]] offered shelter to Ali within the fortress of [[Krak al-Niraan]]. Jamal appointed Ali as his Chief Inquisitor where his erratic and violent behavior could be put to use."
