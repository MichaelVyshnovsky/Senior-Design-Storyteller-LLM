'''Zulkir''' was an ''[[awaken|awakened]]'' [[dire badger]] friend and companion of the High Priest of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] [[Ryngoth]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Zulkir was a furry medium-sized animal with a distinctive white stripe from the tip of its elongated nose to the back of its head and white cheeks.

==Personality==
Zulkir was a very loyal badger, even though his friend Ryngoth, was a completely evil creature. Zulkir often pretended to be an ordinary animal when other people were around, carefully watching and listening in spying for Ryngoth.

==Abilities==
Apart from being as intelligent as any [[human]], Zulkir possessed all the abilities of a dire badger. He could burrow, deal double attacks with his claws, had heightened senses, and was very proficient in stealth.

Similarly to human [[berserker]]s, Zulkir was prone to go into a berserk rage when hurt.

Even though Zulkir was intelligent, he was still a beast, making him susceptible to the magic that affected animals.

==History==
At some point before 1369 DR, Ryngoth befriended the dire badger, after a [[druid]] granted him sentience with the ''[[awaken]]'' spell. Ryngoth named the badger Zulkir, after his own [[Thay|Thayan]] past.

Zulkir accompanied Ryngoth to [[Cormanthor]], as the High Priest was put in charge of the Cult of the Dragon's operations in the [[Polyandrium]], the dire badger spent his time in the [[Tower of Bones]], in Ryngoth's room. There, Zulkir lounged on a comfy floor cushion, guarding his friend's possessions and pretending to be a simple beast.
