Zulkir was an awakened dire badger friend and companion of the High Priest of the Cult of the Dragon Ryngoth circa 1369 DR.
Zulkir was a furry medium-sized animal with a distinctive white stripe from the tip of its elongated nose to the back of its head and white cheeks.
Zulkir was a very loyal badger, even though his friend Ryngoth, was a completely evil creature. Zulkir often pretended to be an ordinary animal when other people were around, carefully watching and listening in spying for Ryngoth.
Apart from being as intelligent as any human, Zulkir possessed all the abilities of a dire badger. He could burrow, deal double attacks with his claws, had heightened senses, and was very proficient in stealth.
Similarly to human berserkers, Zulkir was prone to go into a berserk rage when hurt.
Even though Zulkir was intelligent, he was still a beast, making him susceptible to the magic that affected animals.
At some point before 1369 DR, Ryngoth befriended the dire badger, after a druid granted him sentience with the awaken spell. Ryngoth named the badger Zulkir, after his own Thayan past.
Zulkir accompanied Ryngoth to Cormanthor, as the High Priest was put in charge of the Cult of the Dragons operations in the Polyandrium, the dire badger spent his time in the Tower of Bones, in Ryngoths room. There, Zulkir lounged on a comfy floor cushion, guarding his friends possessions and pretending to be a simple beast.
