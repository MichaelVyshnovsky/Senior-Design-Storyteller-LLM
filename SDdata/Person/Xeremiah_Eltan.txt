Grand Duke Eltan ( he founded the Flaming Fist mercenary company, unifying several smaller mercenary groups in the process. The Fist quickly became popular, drawing so many recruits that it numbered two thousand strong not long after its foundation. With his newfound political power, Eltan leveraged his way onto the citys ruling Council of Four. One of his first acts was to hire his own company to establish law and order in the crime-ridden Lower City of Baldurs Gate, using government taxes to finance the enterprise. Incorporating Eltan and the Flaming Fist into the ruling structure of Baldurs Gate was a large benefit to the city, through increasing tax revenue, curbing lawlessness, and making it a significant military power along the Sword Coast.
In the early 1360s DR, Eltan and the Flaming Fist were involved in several ventures. They were hired by Sembia to fight the Tuigan menace in the Hordelands, and aided the Golden Legion of Amn in ending the notorious pirate lord Akbet-Khrul. Eltan also hired his company out for reduced rates in Tethyr it was speculated he was planning to leverage this into setting up a puppet government for himself.
When Maztica was discovered in the , Eltan immediately financed expeditions to the new continent, as well as to Chult. He was inspired by his citys founder, Balduran, who had vanished whilst searching for Anchorome. Seized by an urge to explore, Eltan purchased a fleet of ships and sent hundreds of Flaming Fist across the sea, led by his friend Scar. Fort Flame was heavily beset by sahuagin and wild elves, but remained standing. Scar returned to Baldurs Gate, and in the  reinforcements sent by Eltan arrived at Fort Flame.
When the iron crisis plagued the Sword Coast a couple years later, Duke Eltan worked with Scar and Abdel Adrian to investigate the Iron Throne and their activities within the city. Unfortunately, a greater doppelganger took the place of Eltans healer Rashad and gradually poisoned the Grand Duke over a period of time. While the untrustworthy Angelo Dosan briefly took power as the head of the Flaming Fist, Eltan was able to recover from his ailment.
In Uktar of that year, Eltan and his fellow dukes committed one hundred Flaming Fist mercenaries to the Coalition army. The combined forces marched on Dragonspear Castle to stop the senseless destruction caused by the Shining Crusade.
Sometime before the , Grand Duke Eltan sent Flame Art Cullagh to spy on the Thorm family of the Moonrise Towers. Under Eltans orders, Art was to rent lodgings at the Last Light Inn and investigate reports of corruption and a Sharran enclave in the town of Reithwin, starting with the House of Healing.
By the , Eltan was long dead, but still remembered. His descendants became a patriar family in Baldurs Gate, though they sold their stake in the Flaming Fist company to cover debt. Eltans armor and sword were on display among other trophies and relics in the Seatower of Balduran.
