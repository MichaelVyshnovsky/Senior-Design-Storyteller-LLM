        "mainbody": "Ragrath Deathclaw was a cleric of Gruumsh for the Ripped Gut tribe of orcs of Baraskur during the 14 century DR.\nAlthough his father Arlagh was the clans chieftain, Ragrath was more influenced by another follower of the \"One-Eyed God\", Orauth Skullstone. In fact, the younger Deathclaw was so swayed by Skullstone and his ideology, that he planned to betray his father in the name of Gruumsh."
