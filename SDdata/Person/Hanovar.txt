Hanovar of Ruathym was a barkeep in Nexal.
Hanovar was one of the renegades living in the human quarter of Nexal in 1362 DR. That year, after Millos, the barkeep of The Deaths Head bar, was sacrificed to Zaltec, Hanovar took control of the bar.
Afterward, he spoke with Ironspike, a former acquaintance of Millos, and an adventuring party hired by Drakosa to find the Cloak of One Plume for the right price. However, soon after, a patrol of Viperhands orcs entered the bar with the intent to kill all people present.
