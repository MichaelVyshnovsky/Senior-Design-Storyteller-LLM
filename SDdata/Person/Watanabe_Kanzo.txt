Watanabe Kanzo was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan who ran a posthouse in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
In a posthouse in the center of an imperial shoen, he led a company of twenty samurai and one hundred bushi. It was clear that all these men were not needed to run the place instead, they were a show of force by Niwa Hirotada.
Watanabe was one of the most loyal followers of the Niwa clan.
