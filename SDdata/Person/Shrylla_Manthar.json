        "mainbody": "Shrylla Manthar was a noble inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShrylla fled from her family when faced with a forced marriage that she wanted nothing to do with. For many years she used a magical disguise to hide her identiy and lived on Runers Alley, posing as a minstrel who played the pipes. During this time she went by the name Shrylla of the Spiders and simply Runer. Her hair hid needles, daggers, and even a trained venomous spider, leading to her nickname.\nOne day she encounted a wizard who believed her pipes to be enchanted and threatening him with a magical attack. The wizard used his own magic to dispel Shryllas facade, revealing her idenity after so many years. Unmasked, Shrylla refused to return to her family and felt her death was near. She climbed Mount Waterdeep to view the sunrise for a final time and died there. Her body was not discovered for many months, and by that time all that remained was a skeleton with a single spider living within the skull.\nThe alley where she slept for 30 years was eventually called Runers Alley."
