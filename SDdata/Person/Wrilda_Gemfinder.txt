{{quote|Oh, look, the provincial is still around. Taking notes on how the city folk do things?|Wrilda Gemfinder}}

==Description==
Wrilda was a [[rock gnomish]] woman with a light skin tone, hazel eyes, and long brown hair gathered in a bushy ponytail. Her haughty demeanor and quality clothes suggested Wrilda to be a woman of means.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Wrilda was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. She could often be found dining whilst sharing a table with her [[elf|elvish]] friend named "Ears" [[Oohna]]. Wrilda believed that other visitors of the Elfsong were provincial yokels who could not afford the establishment's patronage.
