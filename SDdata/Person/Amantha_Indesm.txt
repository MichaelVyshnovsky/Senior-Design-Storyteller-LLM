'''Amantha Indesm''' was a noblewoman of [[Cormyr]] and a [[Harper]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
One early spring afternoon in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, Amantha Indesm was among the guests at [[Haelithtorntowers]] for a meeting with [[Joysil Ambrur]]. When she was about to leave, she embraced her host before departing. A fellow guest, [[Noumea Cardellith]], noticed that she'd cast a spell on Joysil at that point, and warned their host once Amantha was out of earshot. Joysil explained that Amantha did that every time, and then consented to have the spell broken.

==Description==
At the meeting, Amantha Indesm wore an emerald gown with bare shoulders. To Noumea, she had both the smoldering eyes of a [[tiger|tigress]] and the tinkling smile of an innocent.

==Abilities==
She had the ability to cast at least one [[spell]], or else somehow lay spells on people quite discreetly.

==Activities==
She was a regular at Joysil Ambrur's meetings.
