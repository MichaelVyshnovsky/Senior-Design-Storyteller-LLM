        "mainbody": "'''Rautheene''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] from [[Oerth]] and an apprentice of [[Mordenkainen]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Rautheene was slender with long black hair and considered stunningly beautiful. She was \"half a head taller\" than both [[Elminster]] and [[Mordenkainen]], and [[Ed Greenwood]] described her laugh as \"the merriest tinkling laughter [he'd] ever heard.\"",
        "Personality": "Rautheene was very praiseful of Mordenkainen, insisting that she would call him the greatest archmage of Oerth. She had a tendency to a sarcastic tongue, which tended to not play out well when amongst powerful archmages. She enjoyed many foods of Earth; one of her favorite meals was smoked [[salmon]] covered in praline'n'cream ice cream.",
        "Relationships": "Rautheene was the apprentice of Mordenkainen. She frequently accompanied him on trips to [[Earth]], and took the place of [[Dalamar]] of [[Krynn]] in the meetings of the Wizards Three, meeting with Elminster in Ed Greenwood's house.",
        "History": "Not much is known of Rautheene's history, except for her apprenticeship to Mordenkainen. She traveled back and forth frequently to House Greenwood to meet with Mordenkainen and Elminster to discuss spells."
