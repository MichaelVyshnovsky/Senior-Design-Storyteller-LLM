She was \"half a head taller\" than both Elminster and Mordenkainen, and Ed Greenwood described her laugh as \"the merriest tinkling laughter [hed] ever heard.\"\nRautheene was very praiseful of Mordenkainen, insisting that she would call him the greatest archmage of Oerth. She had a tendency to a sarcastic tongue, which tended to not play out well when amongst powerful archmages. She enjoyed many foods of Earth one of her favorite meals was smoked salmon covered in pralinencream ice cream.\nRautheene was the apprentice of Mordenkainen. She frequently accompanied him on trips to Earth, and took the place of Dalamar of Krynn in the meetings of the Wizards Three, meeting with Elminster in Ed Greenwoods house.\nNot much is known of Rautheenes history, except for her apprenticeship to Mordenkainen. She traveled back and forth frequently to House Greenwood to meet with Mordenkainen and Elminster to discuss spells."
