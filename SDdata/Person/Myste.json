She had black hair, light skin, and attractive features.\nShe was especially fond of using spells involving color or fog, preferring to use those in place of the more standard illusion spells.\nMyste owned a stone of mixed luck, a luckstone variant that ensured her good luck 85% of the time. The remaining 15% were utterly unfortunate, forcing her to endure many embarrassing and comical blunders.\nShe also owned a powerful ring of protection +4.\nAlthough she originally intended to become a generic wizard, Myste found herself drawn toward illusion magic.
