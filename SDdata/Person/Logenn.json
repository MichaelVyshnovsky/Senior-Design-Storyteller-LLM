        "mainbody": "'''Logenn''', known as '''Red Logenn''' and '''Logenn the Red Wolf''', was a skilled [[assassin]] active in [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. At the time of his death, he was said to be the most skilled killer in Luskan, if not the whole of [[the North]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane||5}}",
        "Description": "Logenn was quick, dexterous, and adept at silent killing. He charged handsomely for his services, and only accepted jobs that piqued his interest.",
        "Personality": "He enjoyed and took pride his work, and preferred to hunt targets with enough skill to make the chase interesting. When things went poorly for him, he remained calm and careful even as he was quick to curse.",
        "Possessions": "He fought with a [[short sword]] in one hand and a long [[dagger]] in the other.",
        "Relationships": "Logenn had a history with [[Eden of the Clearlight]], leader of the [[Coin Spinners]] gang in Luskan, although he generally preferred not to work for her.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane||2}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Logenn was hired by Eden of the Clearlight to kill the [[paladin]] [[Kalen Dren]]. The assassin accepted the job out of curiosity given that the bounty was unusually large for a visitor to Luskan. Eden gave him a [[gold]] [[coin]] that allowed her to [[scry]] on his progress.\n\nLogenn tracked his target to Kalen's lodgings in Luskan&mdash;enjoying that his quarry was pretty good at covering his tracks&mdash;before giving the paladin time to drift off to sleep (the assassin sang ''[[Ghost and the Maiden]]'' to himself to pass the time). He then disarmed an [[alchemist's fire]] trap that Kalen had set in his window, but before he could proceed to the kill, he was intercepted by a disguised [[Lilten]], who pinned and ''[[silence]]d'' him. Logenn quickly got free, but was burned to death when Lilten threw the alchemist's fire upon him."
