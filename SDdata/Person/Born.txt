'''Born''' was a creature that claimed dominion over [[Dragonspear Castle]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] around [[1479 DR]].

Born led the [[undead]] forces that emerged from the [[Nepenthe River]] under the castle. They slaughtered the living inhabitants and destroyed the shrine to [[Tempus]], before shrouding the castle in a constant fog and repelling efforts to retake the castle. Born raided the graves of lost cities on the [[High Moor]] to expand his army of undead.<ref>
