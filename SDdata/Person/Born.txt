Born was a creature that claimed dominion over Dragonspear Castle in the Western Heartlands around 1479 DR.
Born led the undead forces that emerged from the Nepenthe River under the castle. They slaughtered the living inhabitants and destroyed the shrine to Tempus, before shrouding the castle in a constant fog and repelling efforts to retake the castle. Born raided the graves of lost cities on the High Moor to expand his army of undead.
