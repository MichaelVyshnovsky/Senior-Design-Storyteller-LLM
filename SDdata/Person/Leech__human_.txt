Leech was a healer in Skullport and owner of Leechs Quick Cures.
During his youth, Leech studied under a crackpot Calishite chirurgeon. Thanks to his masters tutelage, he could heal most injuries without the use of magic, assuming his fee was paid. Leech could also remove poisons using giant leeches. Around 1370 DR, if someone unfortunately died under Leechs care, he took the body to Mhaug.
