'''Leech''' was a healer in [[Skullport]] and owner of [[Leech's Quick Cures]].

==History==
During his youth, Leech studied under a crackpot [[Calishite]] chirurgeon. Thanks to his master's tutelage, he could heal most injuries without the use of magic, assuming his fee was paid. Leech could also remove poisons using [[giant leech]]es. Around [[1370 DR]], if someone unfortunately died under Leech's care, he took the body to [[Mhaug]].
