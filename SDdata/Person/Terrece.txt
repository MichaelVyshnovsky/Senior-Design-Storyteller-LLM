Terrece was a leader of a mercenary mages band that included Gracien and Malacazar, who operated in Athkatla in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Terrece was a mercenary through and through. He performed tasks he was paid to do, despite not agreeing with them from a moral standpoint. However, all obligations to a client ended once a contract was fulfilled.
Terrece was a competent spellcaster and a conjurer. He was ready to defend himself with such spells as stoneskin, minor spell turning, and mirror image. How offensive spells included chain lightning, death spell, as well as magic missile. He also did not hesitate to use domination, mislead, and confusion.
The conjurer wore a simple adventurers robe and used magical defenses of bracers to the death and a ring of the princes. Terrece armed himself with an enchanted +1 quarterstaff and darts.
In the , Terrece and his comrades were hired by Baron Ployer to exact revenge on Harpers who ruined his slave business in Calimshan years prior. These Harper agents were Jaheira and Belgrade. Terreces contract called for the wizards three to develop a lingering curse that weakened and eventually killed the targets. Belgrade was the first victim cursed with the deathly magic, and he expired, with Jaheiras being the next victim. Terrece completed his contract and cursed Jaheira. However, the wizard bore no love for his employer he offered Jaheiras companion, Abdel Adrian, to hire him to "return the favor" to Baron Ployer. Even though it was unrecorded if Abdel and Jaheira agreed to the offer, Ployer was eventually tracked down and confronted by the adventurers. Terrece, Gracien, and Malacazar may have joined them at Ployers derelict home in Athkatla, confronting the villain and likely ending his life.
