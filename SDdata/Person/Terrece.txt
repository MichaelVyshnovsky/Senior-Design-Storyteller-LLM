'''Terrece''' was a leader of a mercenary [[mage]]s' band that included [[Gracien]] and [[Malacazar]], who operated in [[Athkatla]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Our group was directed to harm one of your number, though it was just business. I am here to speak an offer of counter-employment. We performed a service for your enemy, but that contract has expired... though we have been asked to perform another task in the future. We find Mister Ployer distasteful, even in comparison to others of his ilk. It would not disturb us to...make other arrangements around that task in the future. You will find him eventually, and we are to be there. Or perhaps we are not. That is the offer I make today.''|Terrece}}

==Description==
Terrece was a mercenary through and through. He performed tasks he was paid to do, despite not agreeing with them from a moral standpoint. However, all obligations to a client ended once a contract was fulfilled.

==Abilities==
Terrece was a competent spellcaster and a [[conjurer]]. He was ready to defend himself with such [[spell]]s as ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[minor spell turning]]'', and ''[[mirror image]]''. How offensive spells included ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[death spell]]'', as well as ''[[magic missile]]''. He also did not hesitate to use ''[[domination]]'', ''[[mislead]]'', and ''[[confusion]]''.

==Possessions==
The conjurer wore a simple ''[[adventurer's robe]]'' and used magical defenses of ''[[bracers to the death]]'' and a ''[[ring of the princes]]''. Terrece armed himself with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[quarterstaff]] and [[dart]]s.

==History==
{{fq
| text   = Mr. Ployer,<br/>We have prepared the necessary spells and await your order. Our normal efficiency has been forgone in favor of, as you said, "increased pain and suffering." Your payment was received, and though it should have been more, given your continued financial difficulty, it will suffice for now. We will strike when you have located her.<br/>Terrece

}}
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Terrece and his comrades were hired by Baron [[Ployer]] to exact revenge on [[Harper]]s who ruined his slave business in [[Calimshan]] years prior. These Harper agents were [[Jaheira]] and [[Belgrade]]. Terrece's contract called for the wizards three to develop a lingering ''[[curse]]'' that weakened and eventually killed the targets. Belgrade was the first victim cursed with the deathly magic, and he expired, with Jaheira's being the next victim. Terrece completed his contract and cursed Jaheira. However, the wizard bore no love for his employer; he offered Jaheira's companion, [[Abdel Adrian]], to hire him to "return the favor" to Baron Ployer. Even though it was unrecorded if Abdel and Jaheira agreed to the offer, Ployer was eventually tracked down and confronted by the adventurers. Terrece, Gracien, and Malacazar may have joined them at Ployer's derelict home in Athkatla, confronting the villain and likely ending his life.
