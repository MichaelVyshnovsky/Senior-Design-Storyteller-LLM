'''Zaol''' was an insane outcast [[angel of vengeance]] who took up residence in the [[Iyraclea's castle|castle]] of the Ice Queen [[Iyraclea]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|22}}

==Description==
After coming into possession of a powerful and manipulative [[Witch-King’s artifact|artifact]] that once belonged to [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], Zaol was warped from an angel of vengeance into an [[angel of torment]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|5}} If his existence was put in grave danger, he could painfully assume the powers of his former self.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|23}}

As an angel of torment, he appeared as a [[cloak]]ed figure wrapped in [[chain]]s with the artifact&mdash;a shard of glowing [[obsidian]]&mdash;hanging around his neck on a thin cord. The artifact rested against his flesh, and could burn him if it wished. From under his hooded cloak, all that was visible were his wicked claws and his glowing eyes weeping tears of [[acid]]. 

As an angel of vengeance, he was akin to a pillar of fire, and his cloak rippled with [[elemental]] energy. 

==Personality==
Zaol was insane and brooding, and he constantly writhed in torment and agony. In battle, he fought to the death.

==Possessions==
In his true form as an angel of vengeance, Zaol possessed a suit of [[plate armor]] and a pair of powerfully [[enchanted]] [[longsword]]s: an ''[[aegis blade]]'' and a ''[[piercing songblade]]''.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|24,26}}

==Activities==
After colonizing Iyraclea’s castle, Zaol had been twisted into a mindless guardian of both the Zhengyian artifact and the [[Great Glacier]].

==History==
Sometime after Iyraclea’s death in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|6}} Zaol became a protector for the artifact and took up watch over the Ice Queen's former domain.

By the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{4e-time}} the artifact sensed the impending outbreak of the [[Abyssal Plague (disease)|Abyssal Plague]], and was eager to return to [[Castle Perilous]] to be part of it. It began to broadcast a [[magic]]al signal to call powerful, [[evil]] individuals to find and prove themselves worthy of claiming it by slaying its guardians, including Zaol.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|29}} Those who pursued this signal included a group of [[frost giant]]s from [[Kultaakarr]] and a group of [[Banite]] [[Warlock Knights]], although it also attracted the attention of a [[good]]ly [[cleric]] of [[Amaunator]] named [[Yazeth Cobb]], who recruited [[adventurer]]s to investigate.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|19}}
