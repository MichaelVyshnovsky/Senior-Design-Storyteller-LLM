He wore a simple tan-colored tunic.\nIn the , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Gate, Klorrvanks fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the Gray Harbor. Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up nets filled with fish covered in black oily goo. Klorrvank worked diligently, waiting for the next fishing boat once it was clear that most of the catch was spoiled and inedible. In reality, the fish were smothered in oil pollution left behind by a submersible used by the Cult of Bane to transport Lord Gortashs prisoners into the drowned Iron Throne headquarters prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor."
