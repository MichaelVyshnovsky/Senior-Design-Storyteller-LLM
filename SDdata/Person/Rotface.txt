'''Rotface''' was a [[green hag]] of the [[Bloodroot Coven]] in [[Twilight Marsh]] near [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]]. 

==Personality==
Rotface was petty and had a bit of mean streak. She was rude and offensive, with no concern for social rules. In the absence of [[Deathwallow]], she tried to act as the voice of reason but with few results.{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh|10-11}}
