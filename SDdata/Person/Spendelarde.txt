'''Spendelarde''' was a [[wizard]] and [[spell]] developer.

==Magic==
He was noted as the inventor of several utilitarian spells, including the [[necromancy]] spell ''[[Spendelarde's chaser]]''.

==Possessions==
He once owned the [[magic]]al staff ''[[Spendelarde's Protector]]'', which he carried with him when traveling.

==History==
Spendelarde studied [[magic]] under [[Mentor Wintercloak]], one of the [[Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor]].{{Cite polyhedron/125/Wayward Wizards: Tulrun of the Tent|24}}It is unclear when Spendelarde's studies under Mentor occurred. It could have been as early as the founding of the Seven Wizards in [[379 DR]] (''[[Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves]]'', p. 39). Although Mentor Wintercloak left the Seven Wizards in [[682 DR]] (''[[The Fall of Myth Drannor (sourcebook)|The Fall of Myth Drannor]]'', p. 18), he taught several students later in life, and Spendelarde could be among these.

==Activities==
Although Spendelarde did not travel often, he occasionally went on long and dangerous treks to distant locales.
