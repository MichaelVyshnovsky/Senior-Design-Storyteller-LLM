-edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Set (p. 68) uses "Spendelard". Later sources, such as Pages from the Mages (p. 125) use "Spendelarde". In a [http//forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=12023&whichpage=28 forum post on Candlekeep.com], Ed Greenwood claims the actual spelling is "Spendelaarde", and that the other spellings are "TSR simplification[s]".

Spendelarde was a wizard and spell developer.
He was noted as the inventor of several utilitarian spells, including the necromancy spell Spendelardes chaser.
He once owned the magical staff Spendelardes Protector, which he carried with him when traveling.
Spendelarde studied magic under Mentor Wintercloak, one of the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor.It is unclear when Spendelardes studies under Mentor occurred. It could have been as early as the founding of the Seven Wizards in 379 DR (Cormanthyr Empire of the Elves, p. 39). Although Mentor Wintercloak left the Seven Wizards in 682 DR (The Fall of Myth Drannor, p. 18), he taught several students later in life, and Spendelarde could be among these.
Although Spendelarde did not travel often, he occasionally went on long and dangerous treks to distant locales.
