        "mainbody": "'''Glaratha Starntempest''' was one of the nine founding members of the [[Scornubel]] crime syndicate known as the [[Great Goblet]]. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, she was a skilled [[wizard]] that performed [[magic]]al services for the organization.",
        "Description": "Glaratha was not overly concerned about her looks, leaving her hair unkempt.",
        "Personality": "She lost much of her innocence while under the control of her former master, [[Halonidas Dreie]], and her demeanor toward most men outside the circle of her fellow Lords was brusque and distrustful. She was loud, outspoken, prone to using brute-force magic, and did not react kindly to most admonitions toward caution or subtlety. She did not conserve her magic items, preferring to be safe rather than sorry.",
        "Abilities": "It was likely that her younger sister [[Ileldra Starntempest|Ileldra]] was the more advanced mage of the two because of her focus on magical research, whereas Glaratha primarily concentrated on acquiring magical items.",
        "Possessions": "Glaratha had many [[wands]], [[ring]]s, [[bracelet]]s, and other enchanted items. She was never without strong defensive magic and kept a few wands hidden in her clothing.{{Cite dragon/271/The New Adventures of Volo: The Great Goblet|89}}",
        "Activities": "She was passionate about acquiring more magic in any form and was always in the market for new items, replacement items, or replenishing what she had.",
        "Relationships": "Glaratha was very protective of her gorgeous younger sister, Ileldra, which made the male members of the Great Goblet who were interested in Ileldra uncomfortable and wary about courting her. She enjoyed being an equal partner in the organization and was considered the authority on magical issues in the group. [[Ilverr Glaengath]] and [[Hammar Breskult]] were the only members that could convince her to use stealth and subtlety in her operations without igniting her ire.",
        "History": "Sometime around the [[1350 DR|Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR]], Glaratha and Ileldra were young apprentices to Halonidas Dreie, a wizard with business interests and a member of a cabal of merchants in Scornubel that was targeting certain [[Waterdhavian]] noble families that were encroaching on the local trade. Because he was instrumental in defeating the various adventuring mages that were hired by those nobles to protect their caravans, Halonidas asserted himself as the leader of the group, which inevitably led to conflict among the ranks. After a few failed attempts on his life, the opposing faction approached the Starntempest sisters and convinced them to betray their cruel master. Both Glaratha and Ileldra had suffered mental and physical abuse under Halonidas and both readily agreed. Caught unaware, the sisters drowned him in his bathing pool."
