        "Abilities": "Rhaekbog was a trained goblin warrior, proficient in wearing [[armor]] and wielding [[shield]]s, and used an [[axe]] in combat.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks with the aid of an insider—a [[Luskan]]ite [[mage]] named [[Phaen of the Rags]]. When Phaen's treachery was uncovered, the wizard transported a group of goblins to attack adventuring defenders of Targos. Rhaekbog was among the goblins that came to the wizard's aid and died in the process."
