Caliph '''Sajah al-Munsif''', also called the '''Most Revered Mother''' or the '''Quiet Caliph''', was the ruler of [[Hudid]] in the [[Pantheist League]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} She was the only female ruler of a Pantheist city for a generation.

==Personality==
Sajah rarely spoke or acted directly, preferring to let her actions speak for her and leading by example. When she did speak she enjoyed using parables that were often confusing at first but ultimately related important truths leading to [[Zakharan pantheon|Pantheist enlightenment]].

==Activities==
Sajah's resolve prevented the spread of [[Bala|Balanite]] heresy along the coast. She often donned her ''[[chador]]'' and walked freely among the people of Hudid, noting their needs so she could better lead them.

==History==
Sajah served the Pantheist League as a representative to the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]]. Impressed with both her wit and wisdom, the Grand Caliph appointed her caliph of Hudid in [[1357 DR]]. The [[League Conclave]] approved of the Grand Caliph's decision.

==Relationships==
Sajah had twin daughters, [[Inara al-Munsif|Inara]] and [[Jinara al-Munsif|Jinara]], during her tenure in Huzuz.
