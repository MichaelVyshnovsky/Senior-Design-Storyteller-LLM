'''Lazaapz''' was a [[goblin]] [[artificer]] from the world of [[Eberron]].

==Abilities==
She was a mechanical genius of no small intellect, and her skills were highly sought after on her home world.

==Possessions==
Lazaapz wore a custom-built suit of ''[[power armor]]'', featuring a spiked and visored helm, an [[adamantine]] [[tower shield]], a mechanical grappling buzzsaw, and a "thunder gauntlet". The armor was powered by a crystal that needed to be replaced occasionally lest it explode. The crystal could also launch bolts of lightning at enemies.

==History==
She was born with only one arm, and her first invention was a mechanical replacement arm. Her engineering skills soon elevated her from her humble beginnings in The Cogs district of [[w:c:eberron:Sharn|Sharn]]'s Lower City to the relatively more prestigious Tradefair district. Lazaapz was hired by the [[w:c:eberron:Dragonmarked houses|dragonmarked houses]] on several occasions, and came to lead a research team of elite engineers.

[[w:c:eberron:House Cannith|House Cannith]] discreetly hired Lazaapz to investigate an [[w:c:eberron:Eldritch machine|eldritch machine]] built by the [[w:c:eberron:Cul'sir Dominion|Cul'sir Dominion]] for an unknown purpose. Lazaapz discovered the eldritch machine had markings associated with [[w:c:eberron:Dal Quor|Dal Quor]]. Shortly thereafter, both Lazaapz and the device disappeared from Eberron. Lazaapz found herself transported to the world of [[Toril]].
