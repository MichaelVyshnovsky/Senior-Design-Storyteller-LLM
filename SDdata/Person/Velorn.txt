'''Velorn''' was a famed hero of [[Turmish]], active in the nation's early days.

==History==
Velron made his name as a [[warrior]] of Turmish, who loyally protected his homeland from roving [[orc]]ish warbands that often threatened the Heartland of the Reach. His heroics inspired a Tumishian village's name â€“ [[Velorn's Valor]]. The hero's huge and mundane-looking [[shield]] was proudly displayed in the village's town hall into the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
