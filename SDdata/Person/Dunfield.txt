'''Captain Dunfield''' was a mercenary officer who operated throughout the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] region of [[the North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=NCS-p167">

{{Quote|Helm's Hold is overrun by [[devil]]s and their [[Ashmadai]] cultists, my army lies defeated, and I am sent adventurers for help. Don't get me wrong, I will take any help I can get, and I've heard good things about you...However, I do not know if there is anything even you can do against the forces of the [[Nine Hells]].|Dunfield to the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]].<ref name=NCS-p167" />}}

==Personality==
Dunfield was considered a hardened and distrusting man who was somehow able to remain honorable during the difficult times in which he lived. He always did his best by the soldiers under his command and strived to serve the community at large.<ref name=NCS-p167" />

==Relationships==
He had a long-standing relationship with [[Dagult Neverember]], Lord Protector of [[Neverwinter]].<ref name=NCS-p167" />

==History==
After Lord Neverember started the [[New Neverwinter]] movement and rose to power in Neverwinter during the 1470s [[DR]], he appointed Dunfield as captain of the town guard of [[Helm's Hold]]<ref name=NCS-p167" /> and made the official decree of [[Protector's Law]], stating that all [[spellscarred]] residents of the city would be sent to the Hold for treatment. While Captain Dunfield kept the peace in the [[Helm]]ite city a new prophet of the Watcher named [[Rohini]] rose to great acclaim for her treatment of the unfortunate spellscarred. Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Rohini revealed herself as a [[succubus]] and the leader of the [[devil]]-worshiping [[Ashmadai]]. She gathered her [[Ashmadai]] cult followers and drove Dunfield and his soldiers out from the city, forcing them to regroup elsewhere.

Captain Dunfield rallied what soldiers and mercenaries he had at a small camp outside Helm's Hold, known as the [[Last Redoubt]]. They built siege weapons and marched on the city, initiating the ''[[Siege of Helm's Hold]]''. In response, the Prophet Rohini and her cultists summoned scores of [[devil]]s from the [[Nine Hells]] and rebuffed the assault, keeping Dunfield and the soldiers of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] out of the city.

After seeking aid from [[Sergeant Knox]] in Neverwinter, Captain Dunfield worked with some adventurers, including the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], to reclaim Helm's Hold. He directed them to slay the [[imp]]s, [[legion devil]]s and [[hellfire warlock]]s that roamed the battlefield, and then rally with the beleaguered Brother [[Satarin]] stuck in the city.<ref name=NCS-p167" />
