Feldrin was a Baron of Galadorna in the midâ€“8 century DR.
The thin, weak-looking man had a customary sly smile and rarely met anyones gaze with his big brown eyes. He wore fine clothes, but they didnt fit him right, and kept his black hair short. His breath smelled of parsley.
His men wore scarlet, and many were hired from abroad. He sought the death of Maethor, and supported Baron Hothal.
In the , Baron Feldrin initially supported the bid by Baron Hothal to become king, and make peace with Laothkund by giving them the mines of iron and silver in the forest. But after Baron Tholones bid overwhelmed Hothals in support, he backed Baron Tholone to ascend to the throne of Galadorna, in exchange for Hothal being executed on the spot and Maethors future assassination. In any case, the king and Tholone were both eliminated with a spell by Court Mage Ilgrist right in the middle of pronouncing Tholone king, and Baron Feldrin was caught in the blast, slaying him instantly.
He was known as a restless trickster who spent lavishly and often.
