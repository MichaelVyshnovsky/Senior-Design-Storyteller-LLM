The deity granted Norin his limited list of spells and asked of him to help those less fortunate, but to do so secretly. Ever since then he kept his priestly nature a secret and helped both the homeless and sick urchins.",
        "Relationships": "Norin had romantic feelings for [[Gorla]], a dwarf that had been recently hired by the Two Brothers' Butchery."
