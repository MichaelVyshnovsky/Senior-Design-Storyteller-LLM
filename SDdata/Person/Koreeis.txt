'''Koreeis''' was a powerful [[lamia noble]] [[sorcerer]] who led their proud clan of [[lamia]]s in the desert of [[Anauroch]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Portals of Anauroch: The Lost Portal at Hlaungadath}}

==History==
One day, Koreeis and their lamias overstepped their bounds and wandered into the territory of the [[Bedine]] tribe led by the [[Jolarr|Sheik Jolarr]]. As they retreated from the desert raiders, the group of [[magical beast]]s found themselves in the ruins of the [[Netheril|Netherese]] demesne of [[Hlaungadath]], a site of evil repute. Trapped between the ruins to the north and the Bedine to the south, Koreeis and their clan were forced to head north, where the leader discovered a shimmering, iridescent ''[[Hlaungadath portal|portal]]'' within the ancient [[Temple of Mystryl (Hlaungadath)|temple]] of [[Mystryl]].

Since this discovery, Koreeis began focusing his clan's raids in the hopes of recovering a ''[[spellbook]]'', or abducting a [[wizard]], that could shed more light upon the [[portal|magical portcullis]].
