Sallah was an earth gen who babysat an unskilled shair as he travelled  Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Sallah resembled a small plump earth elemental.
Perhaps because of his complete lack of guile and experience, Sallahs halfling shair Rashad al-Anwar always seemed to find himself in tight situations requiring Sallahs skill and experience to smooth things over.
