'''Sallah''' was an [[earth gen]] who babysat an unskilled [[sha'ir]] as he travelled  [[Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993 rare set|39|[[Rashad al-Anwar]]}}

==Description==
Sallah resembled a small plump [[earth elemental]].

==Activites==
Perhaps because of his complete lack of guile and experience, Sallah's [[halfling]] [[sha'ir]] [[Rashad al-Anwar]] always seemed to find himself in tight situations requiring Sallah's skill and experience to smooth things over.
