Talabrina Claddath was the matron mother of House Claddath of Ched Nasad.
Unlike the other members of Chad Nasads ruling council, Talabrina was not purely a priestess of Lolth. In addition to her clerical abilities, she was a skilled fighter.
In 1370 DR, Talabrina had a seat on Ched Nasads ruling council as the seventh matron mother.
