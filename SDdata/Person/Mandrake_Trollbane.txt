Mandrake Trollbane was a skilled wainwright within the Caravan District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Mandrake specialized in making custom wagons for his customers. Due to the precise catering to his clients needs, Mandrakes wagons easily sold for twice the normal asking price.
Mandrake built water-tight wagons used for river crossings, wagons sporting special springs for those carrying delicate cargo, and he could even add secret compartments used for smuggling or in case a caravan was attacked by bandits.
Customers who had the coin could expect their custom wagon within one week.
Originally from the distant barbarian north, Mandrake moved to Huzuz in the early 1360s DR.
