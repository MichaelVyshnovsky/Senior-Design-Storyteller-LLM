'''Verthandantalynx''' was a female [[green dragon]] living in the forest of [[Cormanthor]], to the west of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}

Also called '''Verdant Cloud''', this green wyrm lived 80 miles due west of Myth Drannor, and was worshiped by the population of [[Trenahess]], a nearby village of [[human]]s on the east bank of the [[River Ashaba]]. The villagers offered up visitors and valuables to '''"Little Verthie"''', who defended them from monsters and other communities.<ref>

On [[Uktar 13]], [[1373 DR]], Verthandantalynx fell victim to the [[Rage of Dragons]] and attacked and laid to waste the village of Trenahess.
