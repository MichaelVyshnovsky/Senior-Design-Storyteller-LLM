Verthandantalynx was a female green dragon living in the forest of Cormanthor, to the west of the ruins of Myth Drannor.
Also called Verdant Cloud, this green wyrm lived 80 miles due west of Myth Drannor, and was worshiped by the population of Trenahess, a nearby village of humans on the east bank of the River Ashaba. The villagers offered up visitors and valuables to "Little Verthie", who defended them from monsters and other communities.
On Uktar 13, 1373 DR, Verthandantalynx fell victim to the Rage of Dragons and attacked and laid to waste the village of Trenahess.
