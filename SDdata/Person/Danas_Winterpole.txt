'''Danas Winterpole''' was a [[halfling]] merchant who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/195/That Which Never Sleeps|6}}

==Activities==
Danas was a successful merchant with a reputation for caring for her employees. She was also a well-known supporter of [[Dagult Neverember]]'s rule in Neverwinter.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], Danas was brutally killed in her shop, when a [[plaguechanged]] [[aboleth]] of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] began to mind-control the citizens of Neverwinter to kill each other. Although she was not the first victim of the aboleth, her suspicious death was what warned the [[Neverwinter Guard]] that those killings were something far more sinister than just random murders.
