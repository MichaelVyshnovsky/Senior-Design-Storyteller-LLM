{{Quote|I have seen a little of the future while we were together...Thank you, [[Vala Thorsdotter]].|Corineus, in [[1372 DR]].}}

==Description==
In life, Corineus was a tall and handsome [[elf]] with flowing red hair and eyes that were flecked with gold.

As a baelnorn, Corineus eyes turned entirely white, with white milky flesh was so thin that his bones were readily visible beneath his skin. He had long, broken toenails that extended far beyond his feet. He wore the same ragged garments for centuries, a set of once-fine robes that remained as mere tatters tatters.

==Personality==
Even as a [[lich]], he was a thoughtful and considerate individual. He was appreciative of those that helped preserve the sanctity of Myth Drannor, even in its state of ruin.

==Abilities==
By the graceful and deadly manner in which he fought, Corineus appeared to have been [[bladesinger]] during his mortal life.<ref group="note">While this is not explicitly stated, ''[[The Siege]]''s describes his fighting style as a "bladedance", in line with descriptions of bladesinger fighting styles.

In undeath, Corineus emanated an aura of coldness that could immobilize others that came within a certain radius of his presence.

==Possessions==
He had in his possession a magical, [[Nondetection|undetectable]] ring that allowed the wearer to see through illusions and deceit, as well as turn ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'' themself.

==History==
On [[Mirtul 19]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Corineus encountered the [[Vaasan]] adventurer [[Vala Thorsdotter]] within the depths of the Irithlium along with her [[Shadovar]] escorts. the undead elven bladesinger enlisted Vala to help eradicate the phaerimm that infested the depths of the arcane academy. They cut down the minions that guarded the aberrant masterminds, slaying scores [[kobold]], [[bugbear]]s, and [[mind flayers]], before exterminating the last five remaining phaerimm themselves. In appreciation of her service to Myth Drannor, he gifted Vala his magical, non-detectable ring.
