        "mainbody": "attrick Degronce was an inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nBattrick was a rock gnome with a light skin tone, receding blonde hair, and dark brown eyes.\nIn the , Battrick Degronces complaints of foul odors attracted the attention of Fist Jimi Borleas. The gnome stated that the area around Philgraves Mansion stank of rot and decay, and the smell was coming from the mansion itself, with strange miscreants creeping around at night. Battrick was adamant that the mansion was not safe. However, Fist Borleas dismissed such claims, stating that the stench was coming from the sewers and that he would file a report asking for the eventual sewer cleanup. The response left Battrick convinced that the Flaming Fists did not care about the Lower City and its inhabitants. In reality, Battrick was correct in his suspicions – the stench was coming from the mansion – the lair of Mystic Carrion and his undead servants, with the manses upper floors being filled with decaying viscera and cadavers."
