'''Malus Thorm''' was a surgeon and servant of the goddess [[Shar]], who operated out of the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]] in the town of [[Reithwin]] throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|The objective of the scalpel, sisters, is to soothe, for the scalpel, indeed, is an extension of Shar.|Malus, offering instructions.}}

==Description==
The once-noble [[Elf|elf's]] body had become twisted both by the darkness of the [[shadow-cursed lands]] and what appeared to be self-performed surgeries and mechanical "enhancements". His [[undead]] flesh was gray and pocked with boils and bruises. He had replaced both of his arms with mechanical claws that had scalpels for fingers. Undead flesh and metal extensions had been grafted to his legs, making him unnaturally tall.

He wore a black tailcoat trimmed with gold, complete with padded upper sleeves and a ruffled collar. Over his brow he wore a leather harness that supported goggles with dark lenses, and magnifier that resembled Shar's [[holy symbol]].

==Personality==
{{Quote|What is the light of eyes but the cancer that causes one to witness the laceration of being? If light is the symptom, then darkness is the cure.|Malus Thorm.}}

Malus believed his surgical work, really his twisted experimentation, was the true expression of Shar's will.

==Abilities==
If forced to engage a foe in combat, Malus would utilize his four instruments of loss: a [[bonesaw]], a [[syringe]], a [[trepan]], or the application of [[leech]]es.

==Possessions==
Malus wore around his neck a ''[[surgeon's subjugation amulet]]'', a necklace that could be used to [[paralyze]] his patients when necessary.

He owned a copy of the book ''[[Surgery and Physiology: A Sharran's Primer]]'', a medical dissertation written from the perspective of [[Sharran]] physicians. He also kept within his office a pair of ''[[poisoner's gloves]]''.

==Relationships==
[[File:Malus_and_Sisters.png|thumb|right|300px|''Malus Thorm and his pupils in the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]].]]
Malus Thorm was General [[Ketheric Thorm]]'s uncle.

Malus was served by four undead pupils, Sisters [[Anya (undead)|Anya]], [[Geanne]], [[Hunna]], and [[Sister Vanessa|Vanessa]], among others. He was not wholly confident in their abilities, and believed the incisions they made were not exactly precise. In truth they were little more than outright butchers.

In the late 14{{th}} century DR Sister [[Anna Lidwin]] wrote an [[Anna Lidwin's letter|urgent letter]] to [[Baldur's Gate]] seeking aid as she could not dare argue with Malus Thorm who ordered to heal only the [[Dark Justiciars]] and conducted experiments on the others.

There was a constant dispute between Malus and Ketheric's advisor [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]], as the both needed corpses for their own purposes. The necromancer Balthazar confiscated the most valuable cadavers providing Malus with separate body parts in best case as follows from the Surgeon's [[Tissue and Organ Register]] found in the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)#Morgue|House of Healing's Morgue]].

==Activities==
{{Quote|We do not wish to see you suffer so. Let us cure you.|Malus, speaking of the service he and his nurses provide.}}

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Malus and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. He spent much of his time "experimenting" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Malus attempted to teach his students the finer arts of what he referred to as surgery, but was ultimately unsuccessful.
