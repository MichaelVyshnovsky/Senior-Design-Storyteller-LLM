        "Description": "Erik was a shifty-looking element often seen pacing along Daggerford's docks.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Erik the Fin became involved in a malicious plot to abduct [[Delfen Ondabarl]]'s dear friend. Said friend was shoved inside a chest and as Erik was loading it up onto his boat he dropped it into [[Delimbiyr River]]. Fearful of his benefactor and unable to leave the city due to a lockdown, Erik asked for help to retrieve his precious cargo with unknown contents. The chest washed out somewhere along the river banks. Unfortunately for the man, the person who answered his call for aid was the [[Hero of Daggerford]].\n\nErik the Fin was hired by [[Mogdor]] to track down and capture the [[imp]] name [[Sujit]]. The criminal captured the hellish creature and stuck him in the chest. Eventually, the box was recovered by the Hero of Daggerford, but instead of being returned to Erik, the adventurer reunited Sujit with his friend and master [[Delfen Ondabarl]] of [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]] in Daggerford. What was delivered to Erik, however was a chest with a deadly surprise intended for Mogdor.\n\nAs the chest was unlocked, a powerful [[demilich]] [[Extallimix]] emerged from his slumber, Mogdor was seeming killed by the angry [[undead]], as Erik the Fin fled for his life in sight of his employer's violent death."
