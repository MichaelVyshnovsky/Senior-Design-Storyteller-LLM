        "mainbody": "'''Valom the Deep''' was a sadistic [[sorcerer]] who lived sometime prior to [[1281 DR]] in [[interior Faer√ªn]].",
        "Possessions": "Valom possessed a unique [[cursed]] [[belts|girdle]], known as the ''[[belt of stones]]'', that he had created himself.",
        "History": "Valom lived in a boat on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], known as the ''[[Dim Courser]]''. He was known to often hire lone mercenaries and sellswords to obtain components for [[magical item]]s. When they returned to his floating laboratory he would bestow upon them his cursed ''belt of stones'', then push them off, and because of its curse they would quickly drown.\n\nOne day, he performed this charade on a sellsword from [[Procampur]] named [[Herred]], but he was unaware that the man had in his possession a ''[[potion of water breathing]]'' and a ''[[helm of underwater action]]''. Herred later tracked Valom down, but was mistaken as a crazed seaweed monster by a [[priest]] of [[Tyr]] who proceeded to strike him down. The priest, having soon after realized his mistake, set upon Valom with three [[paladin]]s. Valom managed to slay two of them before falling in battle himself."
