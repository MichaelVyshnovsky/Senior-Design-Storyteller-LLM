Ocelot was a Netherese arcanist and co-owner of Transgate Industries, who lived in Eileanar during ancient Netheril.
Ocelot and his wife Ytartia founded Transgate Industries and developed new forms of portals and other transportation spells, creating superior forms that others could not match. When they died, the business was taken over by their children, Shander, Acciajuoli, and Thamer.
