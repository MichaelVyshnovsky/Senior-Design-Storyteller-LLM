'''Strigga Morkoscavich''' was a crime-fighting [[monk]] from the port town of [[Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]], active sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Morkoscavich was known for her flawless stances that flowed with graceful fluidity. The monk was one of three fighters, including [[Roahton Mobar]] and [[Kimigha Poji]], who opposed the [[Headless Serpent, Secret Venom]] gang of Port Nyanzaru some years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Each of the monks wore one of the sets of [[enchanted]] clothing. Strigga's garb was known as the ''[[vest of soul rejuvenation]]''. Stories said that eventually, one night, Strigga defanged the Headless Serpent
