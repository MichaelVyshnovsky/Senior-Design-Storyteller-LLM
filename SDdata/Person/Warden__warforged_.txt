Warden was a warforged warlock from the world of Eberron.
Warden was a lean, hooded warforged with glowing green eyes, fashioned from dark metal that over time had been tainted with writhing, eldritch corruption.
Designed to be immortal, Warden drew warlock powers from a pact with the Elder Evil Hadar, who granted the use of a hexblade. Warden often used hex to cripple foes, coupled with invocations like cloak of flies and eldritch smite. The warforged could also call on hunger of Hadar when needed.
Wardens hexblade, the Teeth of Hadar, was fused to the right arm. The same applied to the left, which was fused to a magical shield covered in eldritch runes and twitching tentacles. Warden carried an amulet containing the blood of Piscaethces, a ragged cloak from the city of Xxiphu, and a talisman of pure shadow. An eldritch tome attributed to Pandorym was strapped to Wardens right leg.
During a conflict on Eberron known as the Last War, House Cannith built an enormous prison complex to contain alien and extraplanar threats for all time. Warden was built to be the immortal keeper of this prison. On the Day of Mourning, the prison fell, and Warden became corrupted by the very things that the construct was created to imprison. Becoming a servant of Hadar, Warden journeyed across Realmspace to procure souls for the Dark Hunger.
