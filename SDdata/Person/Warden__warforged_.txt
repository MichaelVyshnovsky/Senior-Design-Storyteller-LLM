'''Warden''' was a [[warforged]] [[warlock]] from the world of [[Eberron]].

==Description==
Warden was a lean, hooded warforged with glowing green eyes, fashioned from dark metal that over time had been tainted with writhing, eldritch corruption.

==Abilities==
Designed to be immortal, Warden drew warlock powers from a pact with the [[Elder Evil]] [[Hadar]], who granted the use of a [[Hexblade patron|hexblade]]. Warden often used ''[[hex]]'' to cripple foes, coupled with [[invocation]]s like ''[[cloak of flies]]'' and ''[[eldritch smite]]''. The warforged could also call on ''[[hunger of Hadar]]'' when needed.

==Possessions==
Warden's hexblade, the ''[[Teeth of Hadar]]'', was fused to the right arm. The same applied to the left, which was fused to a [[magic]]al shield covered in eldritch runes and twitching tentacles. Warden carried an amulet containing the blood of [[Piscaethces]], a ragged cloak from the city of [[Xxiphu]], and a talisman of pure shadow. An eldritch tome attributed to [[Pandorym]] was strapped to Warden's right leg.

==History==
During a conflict on Eberron known as the [[w:c:eberron:The Last War|Last War]], [[w:c:eberron:House Cannith|House Cannith]] built an enormous prison complex to contain alien and extraplanar threats for all time. Warden was built to be the immortal keeper of this prison. On the [[w:c:eberron:Day of Mourning|Day of Mourning]], the prison fell, and Warden became corrupted by the very things that the construct was created to imprison. Becoming a servant of Hadar, Warden journeyed across [[Realmspace]] to procure souls for the Dark Hunger.
