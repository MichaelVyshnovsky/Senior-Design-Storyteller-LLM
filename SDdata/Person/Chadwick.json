        "mainbody": "Chadwick was a wizard who lived in Waterdeep in late 15th century DR.\nChadwick had a long, blonde hair tied to a ponytail. He was light-skinned, and had green eyes. He wore red clothes.\nChadwick was born to a family of smugglers. Although his family was arrested when he was young, Chadwick found himself becoming an apprentice to Barok Clanghammer.\nDuring the Wintershield festivities of 1493 DR, Chadwick was drunkenly boasting about his masters Dragonstaff of Ahghairon. This was overheard by a group belonging to the Cult of the Dragon, and they kidnapped him. Fortunately, Chadwick had managed to create a talking map, which had instructions to guide whoever was using it to Chadwicks grandmothers house outside the city. Chadwick had persuaded the cultists to take him to the house for interrogation, suggesting to them that the staff was held there. A group of adventurers, following the instructions of the talking map they acquired at Waterdeeps marketplace, found the house and rescued Chadwick from the cultists."
