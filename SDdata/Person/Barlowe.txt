'''Barlowe''' was a male [[human]] of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Barlowe was the runner of the [[smuggler's warehouse]].

==History==
Barlowe was a member of the thieves guild, who oversaw the transactions of the smuggler's warehouse.

===Gameplay===
If the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions sided with the thieves and have transported weapons to the warehouse, Barlowe would give them a reward before the Watch came to attack the thieves.

If the Kalach-Cha and the companions sided with the Watch, then Barlowe would attack them in the warehouse. Once killed, they could take the papers, which contained codes of the suppliers.
