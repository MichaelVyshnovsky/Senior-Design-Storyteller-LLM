==History==
Yusup Tunyaz became a virtuoso traveling armorer with a notably unimpressive technique by the late 15{{th}} century DR. Eventually, he made his way into the city of Neverwinter in hopes to open his own shop, until then, Yusup sold his services to adventurers and other professionals of Neverwinter. His stuffy personality did not help with the matter much.
