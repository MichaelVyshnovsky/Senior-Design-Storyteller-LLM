Talya Floshin was one of the leaders of the daemonfey in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Talya was the consort of Faersynd Floshin.
Talya resembled the goddess Hanali Celanil as shown in many depictions but with red eyes.
Talya valued potential informants and reported to Ryvvik Dlardrageth. Secretly, she plotted to kill her husband and replaced him with Baron Xhalth.
In 1370 DR, Talya was pregnant with triplets and rumors said they were Xhalths offspring.
Talya was the most manipulative of the feyri. She wanted Xhalth as a new husband because he was more easily controlled by her.
