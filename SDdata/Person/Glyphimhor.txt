Glyphimhor was one of the most powerful lieutenants in the service of Orcus in the Abyss in 1357 DR.
Glyphimhor ruled the metropolis of Orcusgate on the Layers of the Abyss ruled by Orcus. He knew the workings of the Wand of Orcus.
Glyphimhor was a typical balor. He cared nothing for his subordinates but was worried if his city would be damaged. Usually Glyphimhor did not kill personally, preferring to use his symbol of discord and symbol of stunning or his telekinesis powers.
Orcus trusted Glyphimhor but he was still a demon and if he found a truly successful chance Glyphimhor would betray his lord.
