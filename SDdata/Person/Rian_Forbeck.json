        "mainbody": "Rian Forbeck was a traveler and an author who penned the book, The Approachable East, some time during or before the late 15 century DR.\nRian dreamt of visiting the lands of Rashemen, home of the mysterious Wychlaran and mighty Rashemaar berserkers.\nAt some point in their life, Rian embarked upon their journey to the lands of the Unapproachable East, with the ultimate goal of visiting Rashemen. \nRians journey took them to the lands of Thesk, a land of profound tolerance that acted as a great melting pot of contrasting cultures. They continued along the famed Golden Way, where they witnessed goods and peoples from the distant Hordelands and far off continent of Kara-Tur. Ignorant of those lands and their people, Rian was truly impressed, and wondered if their original dream was om fact rather ordinary.\nWhile camping near the great Golden Way, Rian was approached by a traveler, who invited the author to sit with the Council of Zulkirs in the nation of Thay. Rian could hardly refuse such a kind offer, and agreed to put off their visit to Rashemen just a bit longer, and head first to nearby Thay."
