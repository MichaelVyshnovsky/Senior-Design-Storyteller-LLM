        "mainbody": "'''Rian Forbeck''' was a traveler and an author who penned the [[book]], ''[[The Approachable East]]'', some time during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|I am so close to Rashemen, but what was once dream now sounds so...mundane.|''Excerpt from The Approachable East.''}}",
        "Personality": "Rian dreamt of visiting the lands of [[Rashemen]], home of the mysterious [[Wychlaran]] and mighty [[Rashemaar berserkers]].",
        "History": "At some point in their life, Rian embarked upon their journey to the lands of the [[Unapproachable East]], with the ultimate goal of visiting Rashemen. \n\nRian's journey took them to the lands of [[Thesk]], a land of profound tolerance that acted as a great melting pot of contrasting cultures. They continued along the famed [[Golden Way]], where they witnessed goods and peoples from the distant [[Hordelands]] and far off continent of [[Kara-Tur]]. Ignorant of those lands and their people, Rian was truly impressed, and wondered if their original dream was om fact rather ordinary.\n\nWhile camping near the great Golden Way, Rian was approached by a traveler, who invited the author to sit with the [[Council of Zulkirs]] in the nation of [[Thay]]. Rian could hardly refuse such a kind offer, and agreed to put off their visit to Rashemen just a bit longer, and head first to nearby Thay."
