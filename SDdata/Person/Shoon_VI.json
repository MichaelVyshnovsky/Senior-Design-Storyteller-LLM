        "Description": "Shoon VI was described as \"catlike\" in his bearing. He was a powerful wizard as an adult, far more so than many wizards even five times older than he was. This was in stark contrast to his childhood, when he was prone to illness.",
        "Personality": "Shoon VI was proud and confident. He preferred to entrust the ruling of the Imperium to his advisers, but he also had the wisdom to select excellent advisers. He had no love of the military, unlike his mother, and he essentially ignored his armies, letting them control themselves.",

        "Relationships": "Shoon VI was the son of [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|Qysara]] [[Shoon V]] and [[Jahar el Tavarn]]. He was Shoon V's fourth son and the only son to survive to adulthood. His brothers were either assassinated or killed by sickness. He also had two sisters, [[Nada Tiiraklar|Nada]] and [[Selara el Jhotos|Selara]].",
        "History": "Shoon VI was born in [[273 DR]]{{Shoon birth dates}} with the birth name '''Kahlar yn Jahar el Tavarn'''. Because his older brothers had died, his mother sent him far away to the north for protection, where he was raised by trusted friends. He was a very sickly and weak child, but he was taught the ways of magic and quickly grew into a powerful wizard.\n\nIn [[300 DR]], he received word that his mother was deathly ill. He returned to Shoonach to be at her side when she died. The journey was full of traps and attempted assassinations, but he had the protection of his mother's [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|Qysaghanni]]. After her death, he took up the emperor's purple mantle, giving up his given name for the name Shoon.\n\nShoon VI's rule lasted nine years. He was assassinated by 35 stab wounds from his own imperial guard. In truth, they were paid off by his sister's husband, [[Nadim el Jhotos]], and their son, [[Shoon VII|Kodos]], his cousin. As the oldest living male relative, Kodos would become the most infamous and wicked of all the Shoon emperors&mdash;Shoon VII."
