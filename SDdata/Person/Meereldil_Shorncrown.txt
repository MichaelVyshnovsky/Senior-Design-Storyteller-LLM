Meereldil Shorncrown was a famously beautiful escort who worked within the city of Silverymoon, some time before the mid-14 century DR. After her quite successful career catering to the needs of others, she spent her later years in life at rest, living within the Inn of Wayward Sages.
Although it was not entirely known for sure, rumors around Silverymoon circulated that the establishment of the Wayward Sages was financed by Meereldils earnings as an escort. It was believed to be an investment for her golden years. In fact, it was suggested the inns name was earned by her most prevalent clientele, sages and scholars of Oghma who came to enjoy the towns delights after hours in their libraries.
Although their exact relationship was unknown, a woman by the name of Jhalessa Shorncrown worked at the Wayward House, the inn which was built over the ruins of the Wayward Sages after it burned down in the 1360s.
