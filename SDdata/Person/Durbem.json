        "mainbody": "'''Durbem''' was a [[dwarf]] artisan of the [[Goblinbreaker Clan]] who resided in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Away with you! Didn't your mother ever teach you to never bother a dwarf in his cups?''|Durbem}}",
        "History": "[[Borador Goldhand]] and Durbem both were clan-brothers from the Goblinbreakers, the clan that got into a large debt with some [[elves]], though it was not known who exactly or why. During his time in Baldur's Gate in the late 14{{th}} century DR, the same time as Borador took on an adventuring career to help their clan pay off the debt, Durbem offered his artisanal [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] smithing for hire. One of his business partners was merchant [[Bartley]], who operated in the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]]\n\nHe could often be seen slurping [[ale]] at the [[Purple Wyrm Inn and Tavern]] of the Upper City. His grumpy attitude could easily be fixed by buying him a drink and making a crude joke. He also came to possess a key to a treasure vault within the famed [[Halls of the Hammer]], an abandoned dwarf hold in the [[High Moor]], which he was happy to sell to a capable adventurer with whom he shared a tankard or ten. Durbem also collected an impressive amount of gold from Borador Goldhand to pay for the clan and, eventually, led his clan-brother to retake [[Gandam's Hold]] and its mine to aid further with the debt. Eventually, Durbem helped Borador Goldhand reach the status of the [[dwarven hero]]."
