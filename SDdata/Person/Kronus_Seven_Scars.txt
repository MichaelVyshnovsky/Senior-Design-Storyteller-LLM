'''Kronus Seven Scars''' was a ranking member of the [[Order of the One Light]], a cult that worshiped ''[[Crenshinibon]]'' in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Like other cultists, Kronus Seven Scars consumed shards of ''[[black ice]]'' created by ''Crenshinibon''. The evil substance changed their bodies and gave them magical abilities, but also tainted their minds and made them hear the "whispers" from the crystal. Kronus used ''[[curse]]ing'' magics against his opponents and ''[[teleport]]ed'' away from harm. His other abilities included charged blast of dark magics and focused beams. He also could encase himself in an ''ice tomb'' that temporarily made the cultist immune to all cold damage and immediately froze anyone foolish enough to approach Kronus.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, after the war against [[Akar Kessell]] was over, many entities attacked [[Icewind Dale]], all searching for ''Crenshinibon''. The Order of the One Light was among those malevolent groups. Kronus Seven Scars, was among the cultists who used their dark magics to raise Akar Kessell as a powerful spell-casting undead on the [[Spine of the World]].
