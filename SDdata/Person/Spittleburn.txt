Spittleburn was a leader among the Queenstooth kobolds of Forestfall Fen in the late 15 century DR.
Like the other Queenstooth kobolds in service to "Queen" Vorazidrar, Spittleburn had black scales. In combat, Spittleburn favored the javelin.
Spittleburn was fierce and scornful.
During the tenure of Laeral Silverhand as Open Lord of Waterdeep, Spittleburn led the Queenstooth kobolds in their conflicts to defend Throden at the center of the Forestfall Fen against all invaders, including the Muckgrunter trolls, an incursion of meenlocks from the Feywild, awakened holdfast vines from the depths of the swamp, and a group of adventurers sent to investigate the Fen and its apparent importance to the Lightfinger family of Waterdeep.
