}}During the tenure of [[Laeral Silverhand]] as [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], Spittleburn led the Queenstooth kobolds in their conflicts to defend [[Throden]] at the center of the Forestfall Fen against all invaders, including the [[Muckgrunter]] [[troll]]s, an incursion of [[meenlock]]s from the [[Feywild]], awakened [[holdfast vine]]s from the depths of the swamp, and a group of [[adventurer]]s sent to investigate the Fen and its apparent importance to the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]] of Waterdeep.
