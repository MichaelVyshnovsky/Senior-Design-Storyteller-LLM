Nathdarr was a swordsmanship instructor of Waterdeep in the mid-14 century DR.
He had only one eye, in Caladneis recollection.
He was seen as going very far to protect his students.
He taught swordplay at an upper room off Soothsayers Way.
One of his students was Caladnei.
Caladnei trained in swordplay under Nathdarr in her adventuring years when she had to flee the city together with the rest of the Brightstar Sash, her teacher was disappointed and disgusted at their behaviour, but she expected them to protect them from the mob that was chasing them away.
