'''Jhaladass''' was a mage of [[Alaghôn]] in [[Turmish]] who was long dead by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|25}}

He once owned a round tower in Alaghôn, but it was later looted and its [[magic]] deteriorated. Finally, it fell down and another building was erected on the site. All that remained as of around [[1360 DR]] was its circular base and well-warded cellar, known as the [[Wardrobe of Jhaladass]].
