Sacrast Handragon was a Cormyrean noble in the late 15 century DR.
He had a face that betrayed nothing. His voice was soft, close to being lazy.
When it suited him he could be ruthless and swift. He had very strong self-control.
Marlin Stormserpent believed he merited watching, not full trust.
Arclath Delcastle knew him to be associated with Marlin Stormserpent, Mellast Ormblade, and Irlin Stonestable, as well as three lords around Arclaths own age, Broryn Windstag, Kathkote Dawntard, and Delasko Sornstern.
To Marlin Stormserpents knowledge, the fortunes of the Handragon family had fared the worst.
Sacrast was involved in the intrigues weaved by Marlin Stormserpent around his blueflame items in the .
When Marlin tried to release the ghost from the enchanted axe, Sacrast Handragon was amongst the people who were absent when Mirt came free instead. After Marlin related the events to him, Sacrast confirmed hed be attending the Council of the Dragon to represent his family.
After the calamitous Council, Sacrast Handragon turned up at Staghaven House, dropping in on Broryn Windstag, whod been discussing the outcome with Stonestable and Ormblade. He mentioned that, besides the butchery at Castle Obarskyr, where many older nobles had been cut down, he had seen many of the servants of the Stormserpent family running in the streets, claiming that Marlin and everyone at Stormserpent Towers had been slain. While there, they also received the visit of Traevyn Illance, who wanted to recruit them into his own faction should civil war rise, Marlin Stormserpent, who was worried about the mental invasions of the vampire archimage Manshoon, and Osbur, a servant of the late Olgarth Oldbridle.
