'''Garachi Vel'Anova''' was a sailor and a member of a cell of the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]] that operated out of [[Sambral]], one of the [[Windrise Ports]] of [[Laerakond]], in [[1479 DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|33}}

==Description==
Garachi was a large muscled, bald [[human]] male with a tattoo of a flame in his back.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Garachi was a member of [[Bazamarl]]'s cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame. He had traveled across Laerakond, and was aware of the existence of other [[primordial]] cults.

When a band of [[adventurer]]s that were sent by [[Halagothra|Halagothra the Healer]] to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, went to the cult's inner sanctum, Garachi realized their intentions and fled before the adventurers killed Bazamarl.
