Garachi VelAnova was a sailor and a member of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in 1479 DR.
Garachi was a large muscled, bald human male with a tattoo of a flame in his back.
In 1479 DR, Garachi was a member of Bazamarls cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame. He had traveled across Laerakond, and was aware of the existence of other primordial cults.
When a band of adventurers that were sent by Halagothra the Healer to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, went to the cults inner sanctum, Garachi realized their intentions and fled before the adventurers killed Bazamarl.
