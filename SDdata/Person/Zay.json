First we must break their will. Only then will they tell us the words.|Zay, to [[Tha]].}}",
        "Personality": "Like other phaerimms in the WarGather, Zay was a malicious being.",
        "Activities": "Zay was wholly dedicated to bypassing the magical defenses of [[Evereska]] to consume the ''[[mythal]]'' within.",
        "History": "After being released in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Zay, [[Tha]], and the other phaerimm in the WarGather captured a group of Evereskan warriors and [[Elven high mage|high mages]] that sought to repair the damage done to the Sharn Wall. Notable among them were Tomb Master [[Kiinyon Colbathin]] and Lord [[Gervas Imesfor]]. Zay tortured and ridiculed the elven captives in order to attain more information about how to gain access to Evereska.\n\nA short time later a group led by [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] descended into the phaerimm's underground lair to rescue the elves. During the raid, Zay was slain by the [[Vaasan]] warrior [[Vala Thorsdotter]], wielder of a magical ''[[darksword]]''."
