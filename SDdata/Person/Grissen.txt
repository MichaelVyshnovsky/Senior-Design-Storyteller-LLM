'''Grissen''' was a [[halfling]] member of the [[Emerald Enclave]] in the [[Quivering Forest]] near [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]]. 

==History==
Grissen was possibly involved in the case of the disappearance of [[Halvin Graingle]] and six other villagers of the [[Kabel's Hill]] community inside the forest. He advised the adventuring party hired to find the missing people to not disturb the [[elves]], who were on good terms with the Enclave.{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|16}}
