'''The Calling''' was a mysterious evil that plagued [[Kara-Tur]] in the late 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1172}}, the being only known as The Calling targeted [[Azaki]] guild in Kara-Tur. The Calling enthralled a minor attendant, part of the Azaki [[assassin]]s' guild, and in exchange for uplifting the attendant's family, it used the human's body to house its own soul. Now infiltrating the guild, The Calling sowed chaos, generating numerous copies of [[enchanted]] [[shuriken]]s called ''[[Many Talons]]'', seemingly at will. Eventually, The Calling's attendant body was slain by an unnamed [[sohei]].
