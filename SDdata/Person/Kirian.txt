'''Kirian''' was the leader of an arrogant adventuring troupe from the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Come on now, let's be real. Look at yourselves. The bunch of you have about as much style as a pack of [[gibberling]]s. The way you hold yourselves, pathetic. All you are is a bunch of hicks who slapped on some armor and weapons and decided that they could be adventurers. It's real sad.''|Kirian}}

==Abilities==
Kirian was trained in the use of [[sword]]s and had access to such arcane spells as ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[monster summoning I]]'', ''[[horror]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', and ''[[Larloch's minor drain]]''.

==Possessions==
The adventuress was armed with an [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[longsword]] and wore ''[[bracers of defense]]''. She also was in possession of the ''[[golden girdle of Urnst]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Kirian's adventuring party visited the area east of [[Beregost]] known as [[Mutamin's Garden]]. There, Kirian, [[Lindin]], [[Baerin]], and [[Peter]] antagonized travelers, fellow adventurers, and "rustic locals", provoking them into combat.
