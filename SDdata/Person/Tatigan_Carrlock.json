Tatigan regularly ran caravans between Ikemmu and the surface world.\nIn 1480 DR, he pooled his resources with two other merchants to run a caravan to Rashemen.\nThe witch Ilvani and the heroes Ashok, Skagi, and Cree journeyed with Tatigan on a quest to discover the source of the visions haunting Ilvani. Along the way it was discovered that one of Tatigans partners, Thorm, was secretly working for bandits who attacked the caravan. The caravan was able to defeat the bandits, ice trolls, and other perils but when they arrived in Rashemen, they were unwelcome because of the restless spirits that were tormenting the land."
