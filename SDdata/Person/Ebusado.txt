'''Ebusado''' was one of the most talented [[kensai]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Ebusado ran the [[Light-Sparkling Water School]] in [[Yoemura]] on [[Mikedono Island]]. There he had trained the best kensai and [[samurai]] of the country. It was very difficult to be accepted into the school.
