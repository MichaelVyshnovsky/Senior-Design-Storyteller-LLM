'''Mishka''' was a poor child who was taken captive by the evil [[hag]] [[Skabatha Nightshade]].
{{Quote|You act nice one moment and then cruel the next! Everything you say is a trick or a lie. You told me no one was coming to save any of us. That all the kids you found were unloved and forgotten. But Billi remembers her brother! She came to get him!|Mishka, standing up to Granny Nightshade.}}

==Activities==
She acted as Granny Nightshade's personal servant and scullery maid. Because of her repeated escape attempts, Mishka was eventually chained to a worktable in the hag's lair.

==Relationships==
While in Skabatha's custody, Mishka was well-protected by the [[goblin]] [[Chucklehead]]. While he cared for the poor child, he was too fearful of the hag to help her escape.

==History==
While busy at work for Granny Nightshade, Misha encountered two travelers that broke into her lair: the thief [[Billi Sharpe]] and planes-traveling [[harengon]] [[Clipper]]. Mishka helped Billi find her long-lost brother [[Desmond]], who had been kidnapped by the hag nearly a decade prior. When Granny Nightshade herself appeared and menaced the group, Mishka confronted her captor. She stood defiant against Granny Nightshade and called her out on her lies.{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Annual 2022}}

Unfortunately, the adventurers were not able to free Mishka from her bondage, though they promised to return for her and the other missing children held by the hag.
