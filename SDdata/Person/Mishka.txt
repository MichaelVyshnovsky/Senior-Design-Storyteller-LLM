Mishka was a poor child who was taken captive by the evil hag Skabatha Nightshade.
She acted as Granny Nightshades personal servant and scullery maid. Because of her repeated escape attempts, Mishka was eventually chained to a worktable in the hags lair.
While in Skabathas custody, Mishka was well-protected by the goblin Chucklehead. While he cared for the poor child, he was too fearful of the hag to help her escape.
While busy at work for Granny Nightshade, Misha encountered two travelers that broke into her lair the thief Billi Sharpe and planes-traveling harengon Clipper. Mishka helped Billi find her long-lost brother Desmond, who had been kidnapped by the hag nearly a decade prior. When Granny Nightshade herself appeared and menaced the group, Mishka confronted her captor. She stood defiant against Granny Nightshade and called her out on her lies.
Unfortunately, the adventurers were not able to free Mishka from her bondage, though they promised to return for her and the other missing children held by the hag.
