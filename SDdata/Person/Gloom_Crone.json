        "mainbody": "he Gloom Crone was the hag who inhabited the Crone Island somewhere in the Sea of Swords in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , the crew of the Lustrous Lass sailed the ship to the Crone Island, where Captain Harfang made a deal with the Gloom Crone. The crew of the Lustrous Lass thought the isle to be an ill omen while Jorkens, a disgruntled mate, made an undisclosed deal of his own in secret from the Captain. The hag promised the half-orc captain \"enough gold to last the rest of her life,\" Harfang happily accepted. But several days later, the Captain decided to inspect the contents of the gold bags and found only six real gold coins â€“ the rest was worthless. Harfang threw the fake gold overboard and immediately fell ill. She locked herself way in her cabin, trying to contain the disease and hiding away from sinister scratching coming from the Captains baggage. The scratching came from a cursed imp who spread the deadly sea plague, that ended the lives of the entire Lustrous Lass crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made."
