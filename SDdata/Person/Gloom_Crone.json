        "mainbody": "The '''Gloom Crone''' was the [[hag]] who inhabited the [[Crone Island]] somewhere in the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the crew of the ''[[Lustrous Lass]]'' sailed the ship to the Crone Island, where Captain [[Harfang]] made a deal with the Gloom Crone. The crew of the ''Lustrous Lass'' thought the isle to be an ill omen while [[Jorkens]], a disgruntled mate, made an undisclosed deal of his own in secret from the Captain. The hag promised the [[half-orc]] captain \"enough gold to last the rest of her life,\" Harfang happily accepted. But several days later, the Captain decided to inspect the contents of the [[gold]] bags and found only six real gold coins â€“ the rest was worthless. Harfang threw the fake gold overboard and immediately fell ill. She locked herself way in her cabin, trying to contain the [[disease]] and hiding away from sinister scratching coming from the Captain's baggage. The scratching came from a ''[[curse]]d'' [[imp]] who spread the deadly [[sea plague]], that ended the lives of the entire ''Lustrous Lass'' crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made."
