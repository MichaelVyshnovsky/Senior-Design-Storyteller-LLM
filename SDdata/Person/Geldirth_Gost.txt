Lord '''Geldirth Gost''' was the patriarch of the noble [[Gost]] family of [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1219}}. He was responsible for building the underground complex that eventually became known as the [[Fireplace Level]].

==Relationships==
Geldirth's second son and heir was Lord [[Harthar Gost|Harthar]].

==History==
In 1219 DR, Lord Geldirth attempted to increase the family earnings by branching out into direct trading, over and above their existing caravan mastering business. His idea was to build a secret underground facility where goods could be shipped via ''[[portals]]'' quickly and without the burdens of shipping over land. To this end, he bought slaves in [[Skullport]] and brought them up through the city sewers to construct a complex of rooms beneath the family villa and an adjacent warehouse in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. When the job was done, the slaves were resold and those that could not be resold were put to death.

For decades, goods came into the warehouse and then went down to a ''portal'' in the secret chambers. After passing through a few intermediate ''portals'', the goods emerged on the southern slopes of the [[Dark Hills]]{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|6}} The illicit trade greatly increased the Gost family's fortunes, but the ''portal'' route was difficult to keep secure, which cut into profits. Lord Geldirth either died or handed the title and the family businesses over to his heir, Harthar, by the {{YearlinkName|1233}}.
