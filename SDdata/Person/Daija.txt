Lender Daija was a cleric of Waukeen who supervised the creation of her goddesss shrine in the Crossroad Keep in the late 14 century DR.
Daija was a half-elven woman with a cheerful demeanor, dressed in the finest quality clothes.
In the , Lender Daija was tasked with heading a shrine of Waukeen, the Merchants Friend in the mercantile fortress of the Crossroad Keep. However, the city of Neverwinter was still recovering from the Shadow War and failed to provide the Church of Waukeen with promised funds. Soon after the merchant princess SaSani and her Mercantile House were put in charge of the Keep, Lender Daija approached the merchants partners, but not for a donation of funds. Lender Daija believed the tenant of her church â€“ that a deal had to be upheld by the party who initiated the deal. Until the Crossroad Keep or Neverwinter fulfilled the agreement, she stayed at the Phoenix Tail Inn of the Keep, offering to heal those who required it.
