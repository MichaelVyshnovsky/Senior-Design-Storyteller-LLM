Thavaun was a Red Wizard of Thay, who was involved in a takeover of Triel during the mid-14 century DR.
He was somewhat arrogant.
He was capable of disguising himself as someone else with magic.
At Triel, Orthil Voldovan began acting strangely, in Beldimarrs view, speaking stiffly and taking too long to recognize him. Thavaun had magically disguised himself as Orthil Voldovan Shandril found out about this just as she began her immolation. However, Sharantyr, once she arrived at the caravan, quickly realized it wasnt him.
He was slain by Arauntar in the aftermath of Shandrils immolation.
Somehow, he had been whispered of as far as Scornubel. He was known to the Harpers either in that way or through different means.
