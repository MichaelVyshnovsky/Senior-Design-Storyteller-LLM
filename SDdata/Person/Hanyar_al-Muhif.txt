Hanyar al-Muhif was a mercenary barbarian inhabiting Talab in the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
Canny and secretive, Hanyar preferred to carefully analyze situations from the background.
Hanyar was born in Al-Sayaj Mountains and raised among the unenlightened hill tribes native to the mountains. He later found the way of Pantheist Enlightenment.
Hanyar served Caliph Kia al-Sadid as his personal emissary and conduit to the hill tribes of the mountains.
