However, they were harassed by looting mobs of refugees from Tantras, Calaunt and even Mulmaster, whod also come through Maerstar. Oloskar buried a collection of moonstones and pearls in one of Maerstars horse paddocks to protect them from the looters, but did not survive to retrieve them afterwards. The hoard was reputed to still be buried in Maerstar in the years after.\nCategoryMerchants\nCategoryInhabitants of Procampur\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nmttgti7rs0d6wdyvx1qp7arwnaez89t"
