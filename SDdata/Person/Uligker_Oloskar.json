        "mainbody": "'''Uligker Oloskar''' was a [[merchant]] who dwelled in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].\n\nOloskar maintained a country house in the nearby town of [[Maerstar]], and fled there following the chaos and disaster in Procampur during the [[Time of Troubles]], [[1358 DR]], along with number of other merchants. However, they were harassed by looting mobs of refugees from [[Tantras]], [[Calaunt]] and even [[Mulmaster]], who'd also come through Maerstar. Oloskar buried a collection of [[moonstone]]s and [[pearl]]s in one of Maerstar's [[horse]] paddocks to protect them from the looters, but did not survive to retrieve them afterwards. The hoard was reputed to still be buried in Maerstar in the years after.",
