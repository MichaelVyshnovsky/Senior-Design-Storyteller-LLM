'''Barger''' was a bald clerk and member of the town watch in [[Nesmé]] in [[1484 DR]].
  
==History==
Just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Barger was appointed leader of the town watch after all the high-ranking officers died in the fighting. He was very nervous, having never fought a real battle in all his life.
