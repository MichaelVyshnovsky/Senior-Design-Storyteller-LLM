        "History": "Known as perhaps one of the first masters of metamagic, and an apprentice of [[Faerdinalar]] the Enchanter, Thornar was foremost amongst the mages who fought [[Isilger Mountrant]] and finally slew him. Thornar created many artifacts and constructs, working extensively on magical barriers and their breaching; he aided many wizards with their magic-related problems, and never asked for a price; none of those he aided feared he may work against them.\n\nHe was finally slain when a longtime rival, [[Uldinus Lawkland]], dropped on him a parapet which carried an ''[[antimagic field]]''. As the field prevented his contingencies from acting, it killed him."
