'''Vanderanus''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who performed research at the [[Shadow Consortium]] of [[Eileanar]] before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==History==
Following the disappearance of the institute's founder, [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]], Vanderanus performed experimental research into the [[planes]] as part of [[Alkindus]]'s project. Focusing on the unlikely possibilities of [[semiplane]]s and [[antiplane]]s, they worked alongside [[Janin]], [[Pringle]], and [[Shiris Blamira]].
