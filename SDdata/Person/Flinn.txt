'''Captain Flinn''' was a sailor on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Before he became a sailor, Flinn adventured with [[Daeghun Farlong]], exploring dungeons. Once he got tired of adventuring, however, Flinn bought a ship and named it ''[[Double Eagle]]''.

In [[1374 DR]], Flinn became stranded at in [[Highcliff]] like all the others sailors because [[lizardmen]] were attacking the boats. Once the [[Kalach-Cha]] dealt with the lizardmen, the villagers repaired the ''Double Eagle'', allowing Flinn and the Kalach-Cha to sail to [[Neverwinter]].
