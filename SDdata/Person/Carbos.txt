At some point, Carbos and his fellow assassin [[Shank]] got into a duel over [[Bubbles]], the woman with whom they were both in love.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Carbos was hired to murder the foster child of the [[sage]] [[Gorion]], [[Abdel Adrian]]. He managed to gain entrance into the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]] but was unable to kill the young man.

At some point over the next year, Carbos traveled to [[Athkatla]].
