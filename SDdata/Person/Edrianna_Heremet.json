        "mainbody": "Edrianna Heremet was a laborer inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShe owned a special ring of warmth that was given to her by her father when she was just four years old. She was a sickly child so her father had the ring made especially for her to fight off her frequent bouts of chills. In addition to providing the common benefits of a ring of warmth, Edriannas ring also made her completely immune to natural diseases.\nHer parents were killed by an instance of extreme bad luck, prompting Edrianna to secretly worship Beshaba with the hopes of preventing something similar from happening to her or those close to her.\nShe had a brother and sister respectively named Donar and Ariel."
