Huat Rhu was a famed general of the kingdom of Koguryo in the land of Choson (later known as Koryo).
Huat Rhu once led his soldiers on an expedition into the Naktong Moors. They never returned. By the midâ€“14 century DR, it was rumored they still wandered the moors, now as peat mummies and zombies hunting for fresh blood.
