'''Huat Rhu''' was a famed general of the kingdom of [[Koguryo]] in the land of [[Choson]] (later known as [[Koryo]]).

Huat Rhu once led his soldiers on an expedition into the [[Naktong Moors]]. They never returned. By the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, it was rumored they still wandered the moors, now as [[bog mummy|peat mummies]] and [[zombie]]s hunting for fresh blood.
