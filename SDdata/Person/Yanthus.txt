Yanthus was a loyal scribe to Lord Enver Gortash and later to General Ketheric Thorm and their leadership of the Cult of the Absolute during the late 15 century DR.
Under Enver Gortashs command, Yanthus penned a missive on the suspended ceremorphosis among the victims tadpoled by the elder brain that would become the Absolute after being enhanced by the Netherese magic of the Crown of Karsus, as well as a report on the illithid Grand Design. After the discovery and implementation of the Absolute elder brain, Yanthus recorded, from Gortashs dictation, the lordlings plans and search for most unexpected allies, including finding the Temple of Bhaal in Baldurs Gates Undercity.
Yanthus penned numerous documents for Ketheric Thorm during his stay at the Moonrise Towers over the ruined town of Reithwin. The scribe documented, from Ketherics dictation, an accord of his history with the druids of the Emerald Grove and the Cloak Wood circles, with the only comment from the scribe being a coy smiling reaction to the Generals plans to use Shadow Druids in dealing with the enemy circles. Another one of Generals gambits dictated to Yanthus was using the life of a agent of Absolute named Xilvre in order to attract drow from Menzoberranzans House Baenre and impregnating them with the mind flayer parasites.
