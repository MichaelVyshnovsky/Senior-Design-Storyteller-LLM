Aziza al-Nayyir was a half-elven mystic and a fabled Dome Dancer in Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Aziza worshiped Haku with fervent dance routines that aided her desert kin and spread the worship of her god. Her base of operations was the Desert Mosque.
As with all Dome Dancers, Aziza wielded a scimitar in each hand. One of her swords was enchanted.
