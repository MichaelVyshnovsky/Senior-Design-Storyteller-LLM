'''Nantlin''' was a horse breeder and [[Harper]] in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
After emerging from the tomb of an old [[Netherese]] wizard in the {{yearlinkName|759}}, the [[Chosen of Mystra]], [[Elminster Aumar]], wandered the land using the alias of "Wanlorn". He met the horse breeder Nantlin at some point after that.Given the long hibernation of Elminster prior to that time, he is extremely unlikely to have previous knowledge of contemporary horse breeders, or Harpers even.

At some point prior to the {{yearlinkName|761}}, Elminster liberated [[Buckralam's Starn]] from the bandits of the [[Iron Fox]]. After that, he told a local woman, [[Immeira]], to look for the horse breeder Nantlin at [[Saern Hill]]. He also told her to ask if his harp sounded as sweet as ever, strongly implying the man was a Harper.
