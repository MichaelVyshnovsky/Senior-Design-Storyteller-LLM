She worked alongside her brother, Flask of Wine both as guides and assets of the Zhentarim.\nRiver Mist only had one eye as she lost the other in a mishap as a child. She was 55\" (1.7 meters) tall and 100 pounds (45.4 kg).\nRiver was more comfortable in the jungles of Chult and could not abide the crowded streets of Port Nyanzaru.\nRiver and Flask charged their clients 4 gp a day as guides, but offered to waive their fees for a share of any treasure they found.\nDue to their allegiance with the Zhentarim, River did not have to offer payments to the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru."
