        "mainbody": "'''LaValle''' was a competent [[wizard]] who was one of the lieutenants of [[Pasha]] [[Pook]] in [[Calimport]], [[Calimshan]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "LaValle explained to both [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Artemis Entreri]] that his loyalty was first and foremost to the organization itself, not to a particular leader, so he served loyally someone that cared about the guild. He had no more ambition than to live freely and comfortably and to practice his [[magic]].",
        "History": "LaValle had been a lieutenant in Pasha Pook's guild for a long time and knew Artemis Entreri very well. He often used his magic to help Entreri plot his assassinations. In return, Entreri performed at least one murder on LaValle's behalf.\n\nUnder the orders of his boss, LaValle was involved in fighting with the [[Companions of the Hall]] when they came searching for [[Regis]] in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}. Thanks to his powerful magical artifact, the [[Taros Hoop]], LaValle sent the heroes to the plane of [[Tarterus]]. To his great surprise, Drizzt Do'Urden and his friends came back, smashing the Taros Loop in the process. LaValle surrendered.\n\nLater, LaValle became a lieutenant of the new guildmaster, Regis.\n\nSome years later, Artemis again met LaValle, now a lieutenant of a new guildmaster. LaValle told Enteri that his new boss was a good man."
