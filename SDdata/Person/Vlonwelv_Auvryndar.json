        "mainbody": "Vlonwelv Auvryndar was the leading cleric of Lolth and a princess of House Auvryndar in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nIn 1492 DR, Vlonwelv was searching for an adventuring party ready to kill Muiral, who had become an unwelcome distraction. She welcomed all adventurers that arrived to Undermountain and offered them the quest, killing them if they refused. \nFrom her magic pulpit, Vlonwelv often broadcasted propaganda, proselytized, summoned subordinates, marshaled forces, and taunted interlopers. She spent most of her time in the main temple, or in her private apartments.\nVlonwelv had a diplomatic personality.\nVlonwelv had always at her side her adopted daughter Zress Orlezziir and her yochlol advisor Chalizana."
