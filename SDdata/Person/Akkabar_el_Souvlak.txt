{{Quote|"Hunger is one of the great trials," and Ilmater's way teaches us to save others from suffering.|Revered Father Akkabar, quoting St. [[Liwan]]}}
Revered Father '''Akkabar el Souvlak''' was the head abbot of the [[House of St. Liwan's Blessing]], an [[Ilmatari]] monastery on the western coast of [[Calimshan]].

Akkabar was a fat man who loved food and believed that his god, [[Ilmater]], wanted to end the suffering of hunger. The abbey he ran was dedicated to preaching the appreciation of good food and diet.
