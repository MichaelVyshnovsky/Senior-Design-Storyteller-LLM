Revered Father Akkabar el Souvlak was the head abbot of the House of St. Liwans Blessing, an Ilmatari monastery on the western coast of Calimshan.
Akkabar was a fat man who loved food and believed that his god, Ilmater, wanted to end the suffering of hunger. The abbey he ran was dedicated to preaching the appreciation of good food and diet.
