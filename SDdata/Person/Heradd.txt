Lord Heradd was the orcish lord of the Ringfork Stronghold in the Trielta Hills in the late 15 century DR.
In the , the Cult of the Absolute was attempting to recruit the orcs of the Trielta Hills into its army. The first envoy, Agent Mhoss, was slaughtered on sight on the orders from Lord Heradd, as negotiations were thought to be a sign of weakness. Following that failure, General Ketheric Thorm reassessed their approach to dealing with the orcs and Lord Heradd. Sir Yax of Scornubel was selected to be the next envoy as soon as he returned from the Wood of Sharp Teeth. Yaxs strategy was to arrive accompanied by two ogres and issue a personal challenge to Lord Heradd for the killing of Agent Mhoss. Yax then would have to defeat the orcish lord, force him to swear allegiance to the Absolute, and, in exchange, the cult would offer Lord Heradd an alliance in conquering the other two orcish communities of the Trielta Hills.
