        "mainbody": "'''Aulmpiter''' was a [[nycaloth]] and a member of the [[Trio Nefarious]] and leader of the [[Army of Darkness]] that assaulted [[Myth Drannor]] in the early 8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Aulmpiter was first summoned to the Realms by the [[Netherese]] archwizard [[Aldlas Sodhese]]. Aldlas set them forth on the task to locate the [[Nether Scrolls]], thought to be somewhere in the elven lands. For three months, the Trio Nefarious ravaged the elven lands until they met with the army of [[Cormanthyr]] and were captured and imprisoned. Nearly 2 millennia later, they escaped and began raising an army that soon descended upon Cormanthyr.\n\nOn [[Flamerule 15]], the {{YearlinkName|714}}, in the battle known as [[Banes' Duel]], Aulmpiter was slain in battle by Captain [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]], five days before Myth Drannor fell to the remains of the army."
