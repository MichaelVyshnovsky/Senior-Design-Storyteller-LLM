        "History": "Buldegas was formerly a warrior.\n\nHe was the long-time owner of the Wyvern Watch Inn, in business by [[1358 DR]]. During the [[Time of Troubles]], he gave shelter to [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], [[Midnight]], and [[Adon]], hiding them from their foes.\n\nHe continued to manage the Wyvern through [[1369 DR]].\n\nFollowing the devastation of the neighboring city of [[Arabel]] during the [[Goblin War]] in [[1370 DR]], Buldegas chose to relocate there and build a new inn. He took away his money and some of his best employees. He was only recently gone by [[1374]]. He left his two daughters, Asanta and Baerill, in charge of the Wyvern.",
        "Description": "Buldegas Mhaerkoon was overweight and red-faced.",
        "Personality": "He was a cynical man but generally kind and generous. He was often patriotic to Cormyr, and always an entrepreneur.",
        "Relationships": "Buldegas had two daughters, [[Asanta]] & [[Baerill]].",
        "Activities": "Buldegas made the Wyvern Watch Inn successful with his low prices, though he also went for low quality. He watered down the [[beer]] and [[wine]], and instructed his daughters to do the same, though they conveniently forgot to do so.",
