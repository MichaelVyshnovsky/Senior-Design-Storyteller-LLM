        "mainbody": "Buldegas Mhaerkoon was a human man living in the cities of Wheloon and Arabel in Cormyr. He was the proprietor of the Wyvern Watch Inn and another inn.\nBuldegas was formerly a warrior.\nHe was the long-time owner of the Wyvern Watch Inn, in business by 1358 DR. During the Time of Troubles, he gave shelter to Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Midnight, and Adon, hiding them from their foes.\nHe continued to manage the Wyvern through 1369 DR.\nFollowing the devastation of the neighboring city of Arabel during the Goblin War in 1370 DR, Buldegas chose to relocate there and build a new inn. He took away his money and some of his best employees. He was only recently gone by 1374. He left his two daughters, Asanta and Baerill, in charge of the Wyvern.\nBuldegas Mhaerkoon was overweight and red-faced.\nHe was a cynical man but generally kind and generous. He was often patriotic to Cormyr, and always an entrepreneur.\nBuldegas had two daughters, Asanta & Baerill.\nBuldegas made the Wyvern Watch Inn successful with his low prices, though he also went for low quality. He watered down the beer and wine, and instructed his daughters to do the same, though they conveniently forgot to do so.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryInnkeeps\nCategoryInhabitants of the Wyvern Watch Inn\nCategoryInhabitants of Wheloon\nCategoryInhabitants of Arabel\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\n4bg3zsqp3v4mp2kgx0213mbbb6fryo2"
