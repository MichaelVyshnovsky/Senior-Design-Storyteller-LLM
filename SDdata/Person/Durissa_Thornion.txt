Durissa Thornion was an illusionist in Chondath in 1358 DR.
Durissa had braided, raven black hair and brown eyes.
Durissa hated all the citizens of Timindar. However she deeply cared for her kind sister.
Circa 1358 DR, the spells that Durissa knew how to cast included blur change self, chromatic orb, gaze reflection, improved invisibility, mirror image, misdirection, non-detection, phantom armor, phantasmal killer, spectral force, ventriloquism, and wall of fog.
Durissas possessions included a potion of invulnerability, a potion of polymorph self, a wand of negation, a ring of protection +3, and a pair of boots of striding and springing.
Durissa, like her sister Morissa Thornion, was daughter of the town of Timindars  resident mage but being more interested in the arts of deception she decided to become an illusionist. In time her deceptions became more and more dangerous until in 1349 DR Durissa killed someone and was exiled from Timindar as a result.
In 1358 DR, Durissa became one of the agents of the arcanaloth Yrkhetep in exchange for having her revenge against Timindars citizens. She went back to the city and convinced her sister to hide her. Later, posing as Morissa, Durissa spread rumors in order to lure the Gray Doom and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea mercenary companies into a trap at Thurgabanteth.
