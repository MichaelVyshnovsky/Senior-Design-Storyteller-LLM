'''Durissa Thornion''' was an [[illusionist]] in [[Chondath]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Description==
Durissa had braided, raven black hair and brown eyes.

==Personality==
Durissa hated all the citizens of Timindar. However she deeply cared for her kind sister.

==Abilities==
''Circa'' 1358 DR, the [[spell]]s that Durissa knew how to cast included: ''[[blur]]'' ''[[change self]]'', ''[[chromatic orb]]'', ''[[gaze reflection]]'', ''[[improved invisibility]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[misdirection]]'', ''[[non-detection]]'', ''[[phantom armor]]'', ''[[phantasmal killer]]'', ''[[spectral force]]'', ''[[ventriloquism]]'', and ''[[wall of fog]]''.

==Possessions==
Durissa's possessions included a ''[[potion of invulnerability]]'', a ''[[potion of polymorph self]]'', a ''[[wand of negation]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +3'', and a pair of ''[[boots of striding and springing]]''.

==History==
Durissa, like her sister [[Morissa Thornion]], was daughter of the town of [[Timindar]]'s  resident [[mage]] but being more interested in the arts of deception she decided to become an illusionist. In time her deceptions became more and more dangerous until in [[1349 DR]] Durissa killed someone and was exiled from Timindar as a result.

In 1358 DR, Durissa became one of the agents of the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]] in exchange for having her revenge against Timindar's citizens. She went back to the city and convinced her sister to hide her. Later, posing as Morissa, Durissa spread rumors in order to lure the [[Gray Doom]] and the [[Sailors of the Crimson Sea]] mercenary companies into a trap at [[Thurgabanteth]].
