        "mainbody": "'''Szuszalan''', known as '''the Warrior Maid''', was a veteran former [[adventurer]] and later advisor in the settlement of [[Goldenfields]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|25}}{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|9}}",
        "History": "In her youth, she was a member of the [[Circle of Steel]], a famous all-female [[adventuring company]]. They dared to explore the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] and, most impressively, lived to tell the tale. Szuszalan won her first handful of [[gold]] from the adventure.\n\nShe later founded another adventuring band, [[The Company of the Fiery Fane]].\n\nIn her time, Szuszalan slew an evil [[dragon]] and destroyed a vile [[lich]], and she won much treasure over her life. But eventually the gems lost their allure and the gold lost its gleam, and her victories grew dull. In time, she retired from the adventuring life.\n\nIn her old age, Szuszalan settled in the [[Chauntean]] abbey-town of Goldenfields. She wrote her biography, ''Walking on a Swordblade'', in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}. In it, she reflected that it was the companionship and sense of having what was truly hers that she remembered most fondly.\n\nShe still lived as of [[1372 DR]], though at her age few recognized her or linked her to her past exploits.",
        "Relationships": "She was both advisor and friend to [[Tolgar Anuvien]], the [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] and leader of Goldenfields.",
        "Description": "By [[1357 DR]], Szuszalan was elderly, and even considered a crone.",
        "Works": "* ''[[Walking on a Swordblade]]'', written 1352 DR.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}\n\n{{quote|\nIt was a thrill, my first handful of gold. More coin than most men ever see in a lifetime of toil! Beautiful, gleaming [[gold]], worked in delicate designs of lost [[Myth Drannor]]! Heavy and soft in my fingers as I turned them over and over... it was a joy, that night! And I had won all this with the strength of my own wits and swordarm!\n\nThe next gold gave me a brief pleasure—I'd done it again! Soon, though, the gold, the [[silver]], even the [[gem]]s failed to excite. I began to understand the hunger of older warriors after [[magic]]. At least it carried its own dangers, its own living, waiting thrill.\n\nFor me, adventure grew stale. When I look back now, 'tis not the great triumphs I recall, not the evil [[dragon]] dying under my blade, or the [[lich]] crumbling to dust as we fought—'tis the laughter of friends around a campfire, and the feel of my first gold in my fingers. Not because they were gold, but because they were MINE.|Excerpt from ''Walking on a Swordblade''}}"
