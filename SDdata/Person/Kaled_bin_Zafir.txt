'''Kaled bin Zafir''' was a [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] inventor in [[Mulmaster]] in [[1491 DR]].

==Personality==
Kaled was an eccentric man, and a genius in his field. He was usually haughty but recently a profound fear had pervaded him. The slightest sound made him jump, and he couldn't stop looking over his shoulder.

==History==
Kaled was born and raised in [[Zakhara]]. He left Zakhara for [[Faer√ªn]] and trained with the famed [[gnome]] inventor [[Nadul DaRoni]]. He settled in [[Mulmaster]]. At one point, he wrote the acclaimed ''[[Codex of Ingenious Contraptions]]''.

In 1491 DR, his research attracted the interest of both Zor [[Aleksi Drejkov]], secretly of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], and the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]]. After the killing of [[Zel Tregarthen]], the City Watch conducted a raid on his laboratory.{{Cite adventurers league/Cloaks and Shadows|13-14}}
