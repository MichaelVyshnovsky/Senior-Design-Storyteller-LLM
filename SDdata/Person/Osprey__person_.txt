Osprey was a half-elf cleric/mage from Candlekeep.
The young woman was armed with a war hammer and a medium shield. Additionally, she carried a wand of the heavens.
Osprey could be found in the library fortress of Candlekeep circa 1368 DR. She was among the group assembled by Obe to help Abdel Adrian train against illusory monsters. The band consisted of Osprey, Canderous, Arkanis, Mordaine, and Deder. Together they practiced tactical combat against summoned gibberlings, xvarts, skeletons, kobolds, tasloi, and hobgoblins.
