        "mainbody": "haben Shortcloak was a scout for Company Yargo that served aboard the Buccaneers Tear during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was a particularly brave individual that did not let danger get in the way of his appetite for treasure.\nShaben was exceptionally skilled at sneaking by others, even when they had the advantage of familiar terrain.\nIn the , Shaben joined Company Yargos expedition to the earthmote of Pirates Skyhold above the Sword Coast North. He and his fellow scouts Thoros and Lili Huntinghawk traveled through the motes swamps and became separated a short ways before they arrived at Skull Fortress. Thoros believed Shaben became isolated and trapped in the sunken village that surrounded the fort, but in truth the intrepid halfling was merely searching for a way inside to recover the treasure and riches undoubtedly found within.\nThoros and Lili enlisted the aid of the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to help uncover their friends whereabouts. The adventurer arrived to find Shaben free from harm, searching for any opportunity to recover the forts treasure. Shaben found nothing of great value, but guessed that it could have been moved within the dungeons below, and offered his new ally just enough information to \"convince\" them it was worth further investigation.\nThe Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge found more than they bargained for â€“ the depths of Skull Fortress were being used by the undead pirates that originally arrive at the earthmote decades earlier. Take aback by the revelation, Shaben sent work back to Company Yargo at the docked Buccaneers Tear while the adventurer continued onwards towards the pirates stronghold of Scoundrels Retreat."
