'''Conoptora Billon''' was a [[human]] man of the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

==History==
Conoptora was a [[mage]] and member of the [[Council (Tsurlagol)|Council]], a governing body consisting of Tsurlagol's highest [[noble]]s and leading [[merchant]] lords. By [[1367 DR]], he had been chosen by the Council for the position of the [[Ven's Voice]], serving as spokesman and adviser for the [[Ven]], the secret ruler of the city.

He was ambitious and planned for Tsurlagol to move out from under its ally [[Procampur]]'s shadow and develop on its own to rival and overtake the other cities of the Vast. In particular, he wanted Tsurlagol to beat [[Ravens Bluff]] at attracting traders, [[adventurer]]s, and other sources of wealth. It was unknown if the Ven shared these plans.

Conoptora still held the position in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Conoptora was acquisitive and adventurous.
