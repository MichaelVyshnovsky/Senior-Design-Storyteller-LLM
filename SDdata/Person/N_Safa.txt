'''N'Safa''' was the leader of the [[yuan-ti]] [[Se'Sehen]] tribe around [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Around 1374 DR, N'Safa led her tribe in betraying [[Sseth]], instead pleading their allegiance to the new god [[Zehir]]. So the Se'Sehen destroyed the orthodox [[Sauringar]] tribe and took control of the [[Temple of World Serpent]]. There, N'Safa started a ritual to summon Zehir and started her plot for world domination, sending disguised yuan-ti spies over all [[Faer√ªn]].

However, the surviving Sauringar princess [[Sa'Sani]] manipulated the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] into ruining the Se'Sehen's plots and at last into attacking the Temple during the last ritual performed by N'Safa. The Hero killed N'Safa.
