In possession of the orb, Gryttmort would muster an army of giants and [[dragons]] and conquer [[the North]].

Consequently, Jaheira had no choice but to leave Minsc behind as she went to disseminate news about the cult.

        "History": {
            "Early Adventures": "Minsc hailed from the far-off land of [[Rashemen]]. His mother was described to be a woman with a head of wild red hair, and his father had a red beard which was equally bushy. As a young man he hoped to gain admittance into the [[Ice Dragon berserker lodge]]. To prove his worth, he undertook his ''[[dajemma]]'' traveling alongside the young witch of the [[Wychlaran]], Dynaheir, serving as her bodyguard. Dynaheir led Minsc in their travels, making their way to the [[West Faerûn|western lands]] of [[Faerûn]]. At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the pair became separated as Dynaheir was abducted by a rather ferocious band of gnolls. Minsc traveled to the nearby town of [[Nashkel]] looking for heroes to help him save his charge.\n\nFollowing the events surrounding the [[iron crisis]] on the [[Sword Coast]], Minsc and Dynaheir settled in [[Baldur's Gate]] for a short time. Dynaheir wanted to stay in the region to investigate rumors regarding the Shining Lady, [[Caelar Argent]]. Some time later, when the hero [[Abdel Adrian]] was secretly released from prison for murder, Minsc joined him in his travels, accompanied by Dynaheir, the young mage [[Imoen]], the [[Harpers]] [[Jaheira]] and [[Khalid]], and of course Boo. The group was ambushed in the forest and imprisoned in a dungeon beneath [[Athkatla]]. Several members in their party were tortured, and both Khalid and Dynaheir were killed.\n\nIn Minsc's eyes he caused a failure that resulted in the death of Dynaheir. He was distraught over the loss of his witch, who had been murdered in front of his eyes, and his failed ''dajemma''.Depending on player choices, it is possible that Minsc will later adopt as his \"new witch\" [[Aerie]], another playable character in the game.<ref group=\"note\">It is possible to play Minsc in ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal]]'' by summoning him within the [[Pocket Plane]]. He was believed to have escaped the dungeon at the same time as his allies Abdel and Imoen.<ref group=\"note\">In the [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (novel)|Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn novelization]], Minsc is encountered in [[Jon Irenicus|Irenicus's]] dungeon (for unknown reasons) and escapes it along with [[Abdel Adrian]]. He has red hair and does not play a significant role in the rest of the story.\n\nUpon his return to Rashemen, the Iron Lord declared Minsc's dajemma complete. However, Minsc himself disagreed, believing that it could never be complete due to Dynaheir's death. Despite the Iron Lord's offer to make him the chosen champion of the land, Minsc declined, having already sworn his pledge to his pet hamster, Boo. This led to a combat challenge from the Iron Lord, which Minsc accepted. After defeating the Iron Lord, the council of witches provided Minsc with provisions and suggested that he continue his adventures.\n\n[[File:Beloved_ranger-5e.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Beloved Ranger, a statue of Minsc erected in the Wide in Baldur's Gate.'']]",

The statue, known as the [[Beloved Ranger]], depicted Minsc cupping Boo in his hands. It was a popular landmark and meeting point in the busy commercial district.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2}} What the public did not know was that this statue was not a mere piece of art; it was actually Minsc and Boo themselves, [[Petrification|petrified]] in a mysterious ambush while they were in the city's slums at a vendor while looking for Boo's favorite nuts. The duo remained in this state for an unknown period, their stone form becoming an unwitting monument to their deeds.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group of teenagers vandalized the Beloved Ranger statue, breaking off its hands and Boo.
