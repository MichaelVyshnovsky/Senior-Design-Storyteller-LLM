'''Szordrin Xorlarrin''' was a [[drow]] of [[House Xorlarrin]] and the youngest son of the archmage of [[Q'Xorlarrin]], [[Tsabrak Xorlarrin]].
 
==History==
In [[1484 DR]], during the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Tsabrak appointed Szordrin to led the [[orc]] army that besieged [[Mithral Hall]]. Wanting to become a hero, Szordrin instead secretly infiltrated the Keep in order to kill the [[dwarven]] king [[Connerad Brawnanvil]].

He used a secret passage to enter the keep with some orc minions but, while exploring a passage, he was discovered and defeated by an adventuring party. Before he could tell much, Szordrin was killed by his magic ''[[mask of whispers]]''.
