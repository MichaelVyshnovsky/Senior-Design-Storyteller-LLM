Szordrin Xorlarrin was a drow of House Xorlarrin and the youngest son of the archmage of QXorlarrin, Tsabrak Xorlarrin.
In 1484 DR, during the War of the Silver Marches, Tsabrak appointed Szordrin to led the orc army that besieged Mithral Hall. Wanting to become a hero, Szordrin instead secretly infiltrated the Keep in order to kill the dwarven king Connerad Brawnanvil.
He used a secret passage to enter the keep with some orc minions but, while exploring a passage, he was discovered and defeated by an adventuring party. Before he could tell much, Szordrin was killed by his magic mask of whispers.
