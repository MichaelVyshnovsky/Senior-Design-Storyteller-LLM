'''Rhetegast Hawkwinter''', who went by '''Rhett''', was a [[half-elf]] [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] and young noble of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|?}}{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|?}}

==History==
===Luskan===
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Rhett was a low-ranking Waterdavian guardsman assigned to man the blockade Waterdeep maintained around [[Luskan]] to keep the [[Fury]] plague from spreading. He met [[Kalen Dren]] as Kalen was attempting to enter the [[Cliffside Cranny]] gate. After a brief battle, Kalen subdued the guardsmen and left his powerful [[broadsword]] ''[[Vindicator]]'' with Rhett.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|548}}

Surprisingly, Rhett was able to wield the sword and later tracked down Kalen in Luskan with the intent of becoming Kalen's apprentice. The two were attacked and captured by the [[Dead Rats]] gang and taken back to the gang's headquarters. There, Rhett met [[Myrin Darkdance]] and Kalen assigned Rhett to guard her, though it was unlikely the powerful [[mage]] needed a bodyguard.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1989}}

Rhett tagged along with Kalen and Myrin on several forays into Luskan to investigate the Fury plague infecting the city. Rhett helped defeat [[Scour]], the [[demon]] who was the cause of the plague.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6237}}

===Westgate===
Myrin shadow-walked with Rhett to [[Westgate]] so Rhett could train with [[Levia Shadewalker]] at the [[Eye of Justice]], although Myrin returned to Luskan. While in Westgate, he met [[Lilten]], who convinced him that Kalen had lost his mind and intended to kill him.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|3389}}

Rhett assumed the mantle of Shadowbane and began crusading throughout the city.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|1395}} However, Rhett disagreed with Kalen's methods and favored [[Tyr]] over the other aspects of the [[Heresy of the Threefold God|Threefold God]] and referred to himself as "Mercy".{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|5061}}

==Relationships==
Early in their relationship, Rhett idolized Kalen and wanted to be his apprentice although Kalen refused.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|2465}}  During his time in Westgate, Rhett disapproved of Kalen's lack of mercy but in the end reconciled with him.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|5294}}

==Possessions==
Rhett was one of three crusaders who, as of 1480 DR, was able to wield ''[[Vindicator]]''.

While crusading, he dressed as Kalen with [[leather armor]] and a [[helmet|helm]].
