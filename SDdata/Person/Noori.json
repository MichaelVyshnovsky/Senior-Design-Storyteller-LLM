        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], Noori somehow managed to enter inside the [[Eye of the All-Father]] temple. However, she was on the verge of death by freezing.\n\nHer chieftain [[Wormblod]] led a group of his [[berserker]]s plus an enslaved [[white dragon]] and a shaman to try to break inside the temple in order to find Noori. In truth, Wormblod only wanted the treasures inside."
