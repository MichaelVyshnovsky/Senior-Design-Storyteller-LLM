        "mainbody": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Vadin'ya managed her business from the [[Openpalm Bazar]] of Samargol. She offered a wide variety of exotic [[enchanted]] items, quite rare on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. However, magical goods were not her only trade. Vadin'ya dealt in subterfuge, was an expert on [[poison]]s, and she brokered information as well as favors. In 1374 DR, Vadin'ya did business with adventurers hired by merchant Sa'Sani to investigate the strange sabotage of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'', in exchange for procuring a rare [[glacier snake]] for one of her many anonymous clients. Vadin'ya used her extensive knowledge of illicit substances to identify a rare poison – ''[[chokemist]]'', that was used in the deed.\n\nAmong other items Vadin'ya sought to procure were magical tusks of the feared [[dire boar]] [[Bal'alak]] and an [[axe]], touched by fire elemental magic from the [[Mines of Selgol]], recently taken over by [[firenewt]]s. She claimed that the axe was for Artiuk. She offered a generous reward to anyone able to recover one of the pure and flawless gems found in the caverns of the [[Shattered Spear]] [[Batiri]] tribe. These flawless gems were perfect as if cut by magic and could serve as spectacular magic conduits.",
        "Description": "Vadin'ya had reddish skin, bright red eyes, small horns protruding from her forehead, and a devilish tail, all evidence of her [[fiend]]ish bloodline. The woman wore navy blue [[mage]]'s [[robe]]s and cut her red hair short. She had stunning looks, a flirty personality, confidently cooky attitude towards the people she conducted business with, whom she often gave diminutive nicknames.",
        "Relationships": "Vadin'ya was never seen without her loyal [[half-orc]]ish bodyguard [[Artiuk]] while doing business. [[Sa'Sani]], a fellow merchant of Samargol, highly disliked and mistreated the tiefling woman, calling her a tart.",
