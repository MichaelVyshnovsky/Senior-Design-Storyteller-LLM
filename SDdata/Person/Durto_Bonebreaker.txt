Durto Bonebreaker was a dwarven butcher in the city of Ravens Bluff, who operated with his sibling the Two Brothers Butchery in the 14 century DR.
Durto wore his hair in three braids and was missing his right ear. He was stockier than most dwarves, standing  tall and weighing around .
Durto had a very stern and reserved demeanor, especially to strangers. He much preferred to do business with those he already, treating newcomers or adventurers in a blunt manner. Durto was also a workaholic, being happiest when he was busy butchering or sawing ice, but valued gold most of all. Though as far as his wife knew, she was what mattered most to him.
Durto was proficient in fighting with battleaxes, handaxes, short swords, and spears.
He possessed a battleaxe +3, a set of bracers of defense, and a ring of spell storing.
Once a week, when he was not working at the Two Brothers Butchery, Durto spent his time at the local Dancing Bear Inn. He usually went with his wife and drank excessively.
Durto was born to the Bonebreaker family and was a brother of Norin Bonebreaker.
In his youth Durto lived a dangerous life, at some point marrying a dwarf by the name of Naia, until one day during a fight he lost his right ear. Soon after that, Durto took up the profession of a butcher.
