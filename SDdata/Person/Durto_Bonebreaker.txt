'''Durto Bonebreaker''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] butcher in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], who operated with his sibling the [[Two Brothers' Butchery]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Durto wore his hair in three braids and was missing his right ear. He was stockier than most dwarves, standing {{SI|4'|ft-in|long=yes}} tall and weighing around {{SI|160|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Personality==
Durto had a very stern and reserved demeanor, especially to strangers. He much preferred to do business with those he already, treating newcomers or [[adventurer]]s in a blunt manner. Durto was also a workaholic, being happiest when he was busy butchering or sawing ice, but valued [[gold]] most of all. Though as far as his wife knew, she was what mattered most to him.

==Abilities==
Durto was proficient in fighting with [[battleaxe]]s, [[handaxe]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[spear]]s.
==Possessions==
He possessed a ''battleaxe +3'', a set of ''[[bracers of defense]]'', and a ''[[ring of spell storing]]''.{{Cite polyhedron/59/The Living City: The Two Brothers' Butchery|7}}

==Activities==
Once a week, when he was not working at the Two Brothers' Butchery, Durto spent his time at the local [[The Dancing Bear Inn|Dancing Bear Inn]]. He usually went with his wife and drank excessively.

==History==
Durto was born to the Bonebreaker family and was a brother of [[Norin Bonebreaker]].

In his youth Durto lived a dangerous life, at some point marrying a dwarf by the name of [[Naia Bonebreaker|Naia]], until one day during a fight he lost his right ear. Soon after that, Durto took up the profession of a butcher.
