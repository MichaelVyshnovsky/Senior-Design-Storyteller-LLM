        "mainbody": "'''Klarz''' was a [[hobgoblin]] sea-captain on the [[Trackless Sea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the captain of the ''[[Koalinth (ship)|Koalinth]]''.",
        "History": "Once, Klarz and a [[ranger]] member of the [[Emerald Enclave]] were marooned together on an island in the [[Korinn Archipelago]]. It was plagued with monsters and the ranger saved his life, a debt that Klarz promised to repay.\n\nAfter [[1485 DR]], Klarz repaid his debt by providing passage to Enclave-affiliated adventurers traveling in search of the ''[[morkoth (ship)|Morkoth]]''. The ''Koalinth'' anchored in a cove some miles north of [[Waterdeep]]."
