        "mainbody": "Quthnorak was a male mind flayer sorcerer who laired in Vournoths Mire.\nContemplative and inquisitive, especially concerning the Weave, Quthnorak was willing to collaborate with even non-illithids when it came to arcane matters. He enjoyed reclining in a pool of briny fluid to relax.\nLike most mind flayers, Quthnorak had an affinity for psionics and could readily control the minds of others. Despite this, Quthnorak had an abiding interest and talent for the arcane art. He developed his innate powers as a sorcerer to the point that he could cast spells such as haste and alter self.\nQuthnorak wore a ring of protection +2 and wrapped himself in a cloak of charisma +2\nA cordial rivalry was established between Quthnorak and the beholder, Sekrr. Both of them had taken up residence in Vournoths Mire and besides working on occasional magical projects or defending the mire against intruders, they rarely interacted.\nBy 1372 DR, Quthnorak had made Vournoths Mire his home along with a beholder called Sekrr. Though they usually left each other to their own devices, on occasion they would work together on some project or to defend their joint lair.\nDuring the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, after the nearby city of Maerimydra was destroyed by the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn, Quthnorak created a device to experiment with the Weave disruption that emanated from the Undying Temple."
