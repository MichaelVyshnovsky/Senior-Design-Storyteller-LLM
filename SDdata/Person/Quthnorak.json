        "mainbody": "'''Quthnorak''' was a male [[mind flayer]] [[sorcerer]] who laired in [[Vournoth's Mire]].",
        "Personality": "Contemplative and inquisitive, especially concerning the [[Weave]], Quthnorak was willing to collaborate with even non-illithids when it came to [[arcane magic|arcane]] matters. He enjoyed reclining in a pool of briny fluid to relax.",
        "Abilities": "Like most mind flayers, Quthnorak had an affinity for [[psionics]] and could readily control the minds of others. Despite this, Quthnorak had an abiding interest and talent for the arcane art. He developed his innate powers as a [[sorcerer]] to the point that he could cast spells such as ''[[haste]]'' and ''[[alter self]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Quthnorak wore a ''[[ring of protection]] +2'' and wrapped himself in a ''[[cloak of charisma]] +2''",
        "Relationships": "A cordial rivalry was established between Quthnorak and the beholder, [[Sekrr]]. Both of them had taken up residence in [[Vournoth's Mire]] and besides working on occasional [[magic]]al projects or defending the mire against intruders, they rarely interacted.",
        "History": "By [[1372 DR]], Quthnorak had made Vournoth's Mire his home along with a [[beholder]] called [[Sekrr]]. Though they usually left each other to their own devices, on occasion they would work together on some project or to defend their joint lair.\n\nDuring the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], after the nearby city of [[Maerimydra]] was destroyed by the forces of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]], Quthnorak created a device to experiment with the [[Weave]] disruption that emanated from the [[Undying Temple]]."
