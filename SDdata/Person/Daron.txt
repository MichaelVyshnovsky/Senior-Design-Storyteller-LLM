'''Daron''' was a priest of [[Sharess]]Daron is not stated to be a cleric of Sharess. However, he is explained as having prayed to Sharess in order to perform the spell that enhanced pleasure, and later stated to be a priest. This article is written knowing that he was a divine spellcaster, that he prayed to Sharess, and that the only such spell is granted to clerics of Sharess alone. Thus, the article is written following the conclusion that he was of the priesthood of Sharess. who joined [[Aniolon Gruanthe]] in his exodus from [[Estagund]] to build [[Lliiress]] in the {{yearlinkName|976}}. After the [[blue dragon]] [[Gerinvioch]] employed the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]'' to hide the town from all observation, Daron died the next morning; he cast a spell, possibly ''[[intensify sensation]]'', to enhance his pleasure and that of his partner in their morning activities. Unfortunately, he became the first victim of the ''Evise Jhontil'' and its curse, as the spell soon killed him.
