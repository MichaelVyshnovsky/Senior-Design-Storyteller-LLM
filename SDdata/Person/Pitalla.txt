'''Pitalla''' was a [[shukenja]] in the land of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

Pitalla used a ''[[wish]]'' from the ''[[leaping fish]]'' to cure the settlement of [[Mo'ki]] of the [[ivory plague]]. He was believed to have then taken the ''leaping fish'' to the island of [[Su'un]] and left it there, where it remained long lost by the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].
