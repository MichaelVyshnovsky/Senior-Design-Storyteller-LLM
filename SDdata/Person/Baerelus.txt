'''Baerelus the Bold''' was a [[satyr]] and local expert on the lore, flora, and fauna of the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]] around [[1367 DR]].

Beloved by the people, he enjoyed serving as a guide and source of wise advice to many young [[Cormyrean]]s within the area. He was kept informed of what was going on within [[Cormyr]] by the confessions of the young folk he spoke to in his daily travels. King [[Azoun IV]] was known to stop by the forest with a sumptuous meal to learn from Baerelus' experience. While he wouldn't reveal any secrets told to him in confidence, Baerelus gave the king a shrewd picture of the nation of Cormyr. Azoun was keen on heeding most of what Baerelus told him.
