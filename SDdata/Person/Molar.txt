'''Molar''' was a shopkeep and a blacksmith from [[Skull Crag]] in the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Molar was an aging [[human]] with gray hair and impressive musculature of a hard-working smith.

==History==
By the [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], Molar ran two shops, [[Molar's Artful Armourer]] and [[Molar's Very Well-Equipped Voyager]]. They're their doors right next to each other with Very Well-Equipped Voyager door to the south and Artful Armourer to the west. Each of the shops had a sign with its name. However, once a customer entered either door, they quickly realized that both doors led to a single. Molar's home could be accessed from the back of the shop, and it had a second entrance at the back of the building.
