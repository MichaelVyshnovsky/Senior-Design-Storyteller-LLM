'''Garmor''' was a novice [[duergar]] member of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Garmor had gray skin and long white dreadlocks that framed his bearded face adorned with white barbarian pain. He did not wear armor and charged into battle bare-chested, wielding a [[greataxe]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Garmor accompanied slaver [[Gekh Coal]] and his duergar med to a decrepit coastal village in the [[Underdark]] that once was a [[deep gnome]] colony. On the behest of the Absolute, duergar held the ruined village to be used as a [[skiff]] port to transport goods and slaves to the [[Grymforge]]. With the events of the [[Absolute crisis]] unfolding, Garmor and his fellow duergar could have faced several fates; they could've been confronted by and slain by the [[Absolute Adversaries]] as they sought passage to the Grymforge or as a favor to an aspiring [[myconid]] sovereign [[Glut]].
