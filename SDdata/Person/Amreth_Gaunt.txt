Armreth Gaunt was a master merchant who resided in Scornubel.  He was sly and had a glib tongue.  He was willing to deal with anyone with the exception of eladrin whom he considered out of his league.  He didnt trust anyone and never took a wife because of his innate distrust of others.  
Although he may once have been handsome, by his fifth decade, this was no longer the case.  
Gaunt was an accomplished fencer but preferred to avoid direct combat.
