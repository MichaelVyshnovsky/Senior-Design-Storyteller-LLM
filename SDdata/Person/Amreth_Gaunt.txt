'''Armreth Gaunt''' was a master merchant who resided in [[Scornubel]].  He was sly and had a glib tongue.  He was willing to deal with anyone with the exception of [[eladrin]] whom he considered out of his league.  He didn't trust anyone and never took a wife because of his innate distrust of others.{{Cite dungeon/172/Eye on the Realms: Amreth Guant, Master Merchant}}
