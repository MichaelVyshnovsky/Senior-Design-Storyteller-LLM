        "mainbody": "Halvan the Dark was an individual who became lord of Harrowdale at some point in the 1180s DR, and renamed it \"Halvans Dale\". He also created the Halfaxe Trail, a route through deep woodland to Harrowdale.\nHalvans personality made him very wealthy but made him many enemies. During his rule of Harrowdale (Halvans Dale), he loaned money to people, and seized the assets of those who could not repay him.\nHe developed a liking for ornate and gem-encrusted armors, and had several made for him over the years.\nHalvan put on weight as his tastes became more opulent.\nHalvan the Dark is widely credited as the creator of the Halfaxe Trail, leading from Harrowdale and linking up with the Moonsea Ride, bringing valuable trade to the dale from the north west. In the 1180s DR, he hired Durl Halfaxe, who acquired a work force, mainly human, to construct the trail.\nDuring the construction of the Halfaxe Trail, Durl Halfaxe and Halvan decided to attempt to plunder the ruins of Myth Drannor, in an attempt to acquire great wealth, but the elves of Cormanthor raised \"powerful magic\" from the ruins and killed Halvan, Durl, and their work force."
