'''Revi''' was an inhabitant of [[Vaelan]] in [[Durpar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was one of [[Zeltaebar Datharathi]]'s men.{{cite book/Darkvision|65-67|7}}

==Description==
He dressed in all gray, sported greasy hair, and wielded a prying bar.

==Hitory==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, he was searching through [[Eined Datharathi]]'s room in the [[West Garden]] district of Vaelan when [[Warian Datharathi]] stumbled upon him. Warian nearly removed his leg during the fight; all the combatants broke off when Zeltaebar arrived at the department, thankfully.
