'''Nadira''' was a [[tiefling]] from [[Elturel]] that ventured to the [[Sword Coast]] with many of her kin following [[the Descent]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You have good timing. Never been much of a fighter, so wrestling a bugbear would have gone poorly.|Nadira.
}}

==Possessions==
At some point in her life, Nadira came into possession of a ''[[soul coin]]'' that she "won fair and square" from an [[erinyes]].

==Activities==
She spent some of her time peering through a [[telescope]] set up atop a rocky bluff overlooking her home.

==History==
Nadira was among the tiefling community staying at the [[Emerald Grove]] following her people's exile from Elturel in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. At some point she became the target of assassination by a particularly fearsome [[bugbear]], likely tasked with recovering her ''soul coin''.
