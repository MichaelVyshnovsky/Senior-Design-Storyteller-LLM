Both great evil and great good must be kept from getting out of hand. We respect wisdom, not power or station. A good king that expands his realm too far puts others at risk as surely as an evil king who terrorizes. We intervene to maintain balance.''|Meronia}}",
        "Personality": "Meronia was a loyal Harper and followed the Code steadfastly. She was willing to reveal her affiliation to friends of the order but not her mission nor business.",
        "Abilities": "As a bard, Meronia was a capable spellcaster. Some of the [[spell]]s in her repertoire included ''[[irror image]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[horror]]'', ''[[charm Person]]'' and many others.",
        "Possessions": "She wore a set of [[studded leather]]s and wielded a [[short sword]] and a [[heavy crossbow]] in battle. She also possessed several magic items: a protective ''[[ring of the princes]]'', a ''[[wand of fear]]'', and she had ''[[potions of extra healing]]'' and a vial of ''[[oil of speed]]'' ready.\n\nLike other Athkatlan Harpers of the Galvarey Estate, Meronia wore a Harper [[amulet]] that possessed no magic with was used as a method of identification amongst each other and the magical defenses of the Harper Hold.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Gorion's Ward]] found himself and his companions in the City of Coin. Eventually, their paths crossed with the Harpers of the city. Harper agent [[Rylock]] allowed Abdel Adrian into the Galvarey Estate, where Meronia greeted visitors to the Harper Hold. It was believed that the Bhaalspawn ended up working for Harper [[Berinvar]]. Subsequently, the high-ranking Harper [[Galvarey]] may have attempted to imprison the Gorion's Ward out of fear of his godly parentage. This confrontation surely would've ended his and Meronia's lives."
