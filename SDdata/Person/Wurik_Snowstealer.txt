Wurik Snowstealer was Raryn Snowstealers brother, and an arctic dwarf from the Great Glacier.
On Marpenoth 14 of , Raryn returned to the Great Glacier, rescuing Joylin Snowstealer, Wuriks daughter, from tirichiks along the way. Wurik, however, had since been impressed into service by Iyraclea, who held several of his fellow tribesmen hostage. Under orders to deliver any strangers upon her, he contacted her soon after luring Raryns party into his tribe, and feeding them poison made of a tirichiks organs to incapacitate them. However, when her gelugons arrived looking for the captives, they deduced that he was holding one captive back Wurik attempted to keep his brother from being taken. They slew him for it.
Wurik bore a bugle made of rothe horn for signaling.
