'''Nalitheen''' was the widow of [[Borold]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}}

==Appearance==
Nalitheen favored drab clothing. Her face was rather plain, eschewing decor, and she had a very particular nose, large and prominent.

==Relationships==
Her two daughters, [[Boroldira]] and [[Naleetha]] became orphaned with the death of her husband, [[Borold]], two summers prior to the year in which she got acquainted with [[Mirt the Merciless]], {{yearlink|1321}}.

==History==
Nalitheen bore two daughters during her marriage to [[Borold]] at some point prior to {{yearlink|1319}}, the year around which he was killed protecting [[silver]] bars belonging to [[Waterdeep]] from pirates out of [[Amn]]. She became a [[coinlass]] afterwards; by [[Eleint 6]] of {{yearlink|1321}}, she hadn't been doing that for long, however. At that time, she crossed paths with [[Mirt the Merciless]] at the [[Scarlet Slipper]] tavern. She became fixated on him at that point, knowing him to be the leader of the force that killed her husband, and hosted him that night at her home for one [[gp]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|97-99|6}} She very nearly slew him, but instead showed him her daughters. He gave her a large sum, and said he'd be back, apparently implying he wanted her to host him again.
