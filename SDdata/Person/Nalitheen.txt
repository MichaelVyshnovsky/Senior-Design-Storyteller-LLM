Nalitheen bore two daughters during her marriage to Borold at some point prior to , the year around which he was killed protecting silver bars belonging to Waterdeep from pirates out of Amn. She became a coinlass afterwards by Eleint 6 of , she hadnt been doing that for long, however. At that time, she crossed paths with Mirt the Merciless at the Scarlet Slipper tavern.

She very nearly slew him, but instead showed him her daughters. He gave her a large sum, and said hed be back, apparently implying he wanted her to host him again.
