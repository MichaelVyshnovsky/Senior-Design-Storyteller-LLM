The alchemist Hazel led the defense while Piniwin and Penny sought aid from adventurers aided by her alchemists fire, they defeated Therzt and the undead.\nIn 1486 DR, Therzt somehow reappeared as a captive of the Red Wizards of Thay, in Doomvault. When freed by adventurers working for the Thayan Resurrection, he began babbling that he needed to die for his weakness and cast an acid arrow spell on himself, dying as he proclaimed his devotion to Ghaunadaur."
