        "mainbody": "'''Sir Darmon''' was a male [[human]] and member of the Nine of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "If the [[Kalach-Cha]] and the companions sided with the Watch and raided the [[Smuggler's warehouse]], Darmon would appear before them giving orders to his men, since this problem worried Lord [[Nasher]] himself. The Kalach-Cha would've told him that the thieves at the warehouse have been dealt with. Darmon and his men would be sad as they had to be at the court with gentleman and ladies. However, Kalach-Cha could recommend the [[Sunken Flagon]] as the place to drink, making Darmon and his men cheerful and Kalach-Cha a bit chaotic."
