        "Personality": "Feythrin fancied frustrating and infuriating big folk, finding it funny as they shouted and stomped. So he spoke in secretive and slippery statements, avoiding answering all askings unless aimed right at him, and even then answering only to annoy. He argued with arrogant airsThe ''Extermination'' module has Feythrin speak somewhat normally, if pompously, while the official recap suggests he speaks entirely in alliteration.",

However, he happened on the horror-show of [[Blaz Merrymar|a halfling]] held hostage and harmed by the hateful [[Skar]], bugbear goon [[Gvrag]], and the goblin gang. The grig, about to act, was audience to [[adventurer]]s who attacked the antagonists and so did depart, disappointed in the defeat of the dupes desired for his delight.\n\nFeythrin found the fellowship again the following day, as they blundered into his [[birch]] bower and bothered his big dreams of buttons purple. His daydreaming disturbed, he determined his new \"deputies of delight\" should engross him instead through endeavor or entertainment.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Greetings, peasants.
