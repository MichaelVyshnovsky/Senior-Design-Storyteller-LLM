'''Harkhuf''' was an alchemist who was active in [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in mid–14{{th}} century DR.

==Abilities==
He was not very skilled as an alchemist. Once he tried to make something explosive and only ended up permanently staining his fingers green.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Senator [[Horemkensi]] was placed in control of the Innarlan canal project after the mysterious disappearance of Senator [[Willem Korvan]], who had previously held the post. Harkhuf was an alchemist who was employed by Horemkensi and who had been allied with the clandestine [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]].

Harkhuf was incompetent, however, and he took over the supply of [[smokepowder]] that had been created by the previous alchemist [[Surero]], but his mistakes in laying the explosives led to the accidental deaths of several hundred workers.

Horemkensi was assassinated by a [[spirit naga]] in [[1371 DR]] and Harkhuf was brought in for questioning. He denied any knowledge of what happened and reported several strange events, including how the smokepowder seemed to be getting restocked, despite no-one on site seeming to know how to make it, and the [[zombie]]s working on the site disappearing mysteriously. He denied that he had anything to do with the increase in productivity on the site and confessed he didn't know what he was doing. This report led Ransar [[Pristoleph]] to come to the realization that [[Ivar Devorast]], the former chief builder of the canal, and [[Surero]] were still at the site working there secretly.<ref>

The same spirit naga who assassinated Horemkensi came looking for Harkhuf two days after Horemkensi's death. Marek sent an [[undead]] servant to shadow Harkhuf because he expected the assassin to go after him. The spirit naga confronted Harkhuf on the streets of the third quarter at night, but the undead servant then emerged and attacked the naga. The undead creature succeeded in killing the naga and then carried Harkhuf home.<ref>
