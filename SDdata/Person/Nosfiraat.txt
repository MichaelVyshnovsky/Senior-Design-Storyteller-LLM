'''Nosfiraat''' was a treacherous [[Zakharan]] [[vampire]] who was trapped in a shipwreck at the [[Blade Cliffs]] to the south of [[Lizard Marsh]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Nosfiraat had a thick [[Midani]] accent when he spoke in [[Common]]. He was dressed in traditional Zakharan garb.

==Personality==
Nosfiraat claimed that as an [[assassin]] he never spilled innocent blood only killing would-be assailants on his employer's life. He also claimed that the only payment for the dark deeds was the victims' blood.

Even though he had no hesitations swearing an oath-bound to achieve his goals, he never intended to keep it as it was only honor-bounding for humans and he was undead.

==Abilities==
Nosfiraat possessed all abilities of a vampire along with the proficiencies of his trade.

==Possessions==
Nosfiraat kept his coffin filled with his grave dirt on the whip that was his prison. Along with it, he had two smaller less decorated coffins that contained two of his subservient [[vampire spawn]]s.

[[Nosfiraat's Blade]] was a magical +1 scimitar that dealt powerful critical damage to the opponent.

==History==
Nosfiraat was a vampire assassin from the land of Zakhara. He was employed by one of the region's Sultans. After a successful assassination of the Sultan's rival noble, Nosfiraat was to be disposed of in fear of him being captured and tortured to find incriminating information on the Sultan. The vampire was provided with a ship and crew and was ordered to leave Zakhara forever.

Nosfiraat's ship set sail to the [[Sword Coast]]. The ship was wrecked on the treacherous [[Blade Cliffs]] during a storm with all its crew perishing, and Nosfiraat survived thanks to being undead. The vampire claimed that all the bodies still left on the wreck were dragged away by hungry wolves. Soon after the storm's passing a traveling cleric discovered the sleeping vampire and trapped the undead inside.

In [[1372 DR]] a group of adventurers investigating the [[Zhentarim]] plot against [[Daggerford]] stumbled across long-abandoned ship wreckage in the [[Blade Cliffs]] region to the west from [[Liam's Hold]]. Inside they found Nosfiraat desperate for their help.

He asked the adventurers to free him from the mystic prison inside the shipwreck swearing an oath not to harm his rescuers. He was restrained by three ritual stones around the cite. All they needed to do was to destroy the stones in exchange for precious Zakharan trinkets.
