'''Elisker Hagathan''' was a priest of [[Ilmater]] the Broken God in the 14th century [[DR]], holding the title of "Enduring Servant".

In the [[1343 DR|Year of the Boot, 1343 DR]], Ilmatari investigators discovered the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]]—in the possession of a group of [[Thayan]] agents based in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]]. An Ilmatari strike force assaulted their house one night in the autumn of that year. The impressive Ilmatari attack destroyed the house and ended with the Thayan band pursued through the streets and slain, amidst a number of stabbings and desperate rooftop jumps. Before the fall of winter at the close of the year, Enduring Servant Elisker Hagathan carried the ''Tome of Torment'' in triumph back to the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]], [[Calimshan]].
