'''Samir''' was a talented blacksmith from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active some time before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Samir befriended a famous [[armor]] crafter from the planar [[City of Brass]], Gisnervi, after the [[brass]]worker was banished from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] in disgrace. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Samir managed to break a ''curse'' placed on a set of magic armor created by Gisnervi, causing his exile. With the ''[[Storm armor (City of Brass)|storm armor]]'' restored, so was Gisnervi's reputation.
