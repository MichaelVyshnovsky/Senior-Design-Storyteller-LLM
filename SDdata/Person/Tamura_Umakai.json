Setsu explained that the evil Za-Jikku from the Qui demiplane wanted the book but it was safest being split in two, with a page in the far and isolated Ikizawa.\nHowever, in 1358 DR, the yellow-robed minions of Za-Jikku twice attacked the village, greatly scaring Umakai and his villagers.\nLater he met Osari Minhiro and a foreign adventuring party. After checking that they were good men, Umakai told them everything and gave them the page of the Book of Hsi."
