He aimed to use Waterdeep's wealth and power to create an empire in [[northwest Faer√ªn]]. By [[1030 DR]], Waterdeep had the largest navy and standing army it had seen since the [[Trollwars]]. In [[1032 DR]], Rhaurlor was opposed by the mage [[Ahghairon]], who had played a major part in the Trollwars. When Rhaurlor attempted to have Ahghairon arrested, Ahghairon turned Rhaurlor's sword into a snake. It bit him, poisoning him, and he died."
