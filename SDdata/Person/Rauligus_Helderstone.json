        "mainbody": "'''Rauligus Helderstone''' was a lord of [[Cormyr]], who later left for [[Sembia]] and died there in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was briefly impersonated by [[Mirt]].",
        "Personality": "Elminster Aumar reasoned that Lord Helderstone must've loved money. Lord Traevyn Illance believed him an honest man in life.",
        "Relationships": "The man owed an impressive sum to [[Traevyn Illance]].",
        "History": "According to [[Elminster Aumar]], a fugitive mage, Lord Helderstone had spent a score, or twenty, years living as a recluse in Sembia. He had also died recently as of late [[Mirtul]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}. Per the more precise Traevyn Illance, Rauligus Helderstone had spent twenty-nine summers in [[Sembia]]. Before his parting, Lord Illance had loaned him 700,000 [[golden lion]]s, with a clause that on the year-day, 10,000 more would be owed. The sum was to be repaid in full upon return to [[Suzail]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "An impersonator, [[Mirt the moneylender]], was caught in [[Suzail]] during late Mirtul, by armsmen under the mages [[Scarmar Heldeth]] and [[Morligul Downdagger]]{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|277-279|29}}, themselves working for Traevyn Illance. The latter, rather than believe it was an impersonator, believed some threat had arisen out of Sembia and frightened the man.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|284-287|30}}\n\nDespite his extensive plans on what to do to punish the man, they could not come to fruition, as Mirt was rescued and Traevyn knocked out."
