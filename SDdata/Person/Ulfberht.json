        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Ulfberht had already reached the fame and respect of a master bladesmith. Ulfberht's swords were truly remarkable, making many people raise an eyebrow at the fact that such a master liked to work for hire in simple workshops, lending his skills to [[adventurer]]s of Neverwinter."
