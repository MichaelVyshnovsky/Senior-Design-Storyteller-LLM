        "mainbody": "High Artificer Danactar, Most Holy Servant of Gond, was the highest-ranking mortal priest of the Wonderbringer circa 1370 DR.\nDanactar led the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration monastery in the city of Illul in Lantan. Moreover, the High Artificer was the supreme voice in ecclesiastical matters for the church of Gond in Faer√ªn. However, in practice, while his word was deeply respected in Lantan itself and among Lantanese expatriates and merchants, Gondar further afield only nominally acknowledged it.\nIn addition, by 1372 DR, Danactar was a leading member in Lantans ruling council, the Ayrorch.It is unclear if Danactar is the leader of the council, the Ayrar, or merely a very influential regular member, a Santar. Morever, since Danactar was not listed as a member of the Ayrorch in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set, it is clear Danactar joined after 1356/1357 DR."
