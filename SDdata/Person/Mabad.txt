Mabad, who was nicknamed the Sly, was a bandit and member of the Desert Wind during the mid–14th century DR.
Mabad served as one of Sheik Ar-Rabis lieutenants. He commanded fellow bandits, raiding local tribes on the Plains of Purple Dust and southern Murghôm.
Though he was loyal to Ar-Rabi, Mabad harbored personal ambitions as well.
