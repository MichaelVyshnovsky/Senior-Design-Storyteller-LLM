'''One-Knife''' was a bandit and an assassin who took part in the [[Battle of Hunter's Hollow]], in the [[Hunter's Hollow]] of the [[King's Forest]] in [[1348 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, the Hunter's Hollow, where the [[Way of the Dragon]] crossed the King's Forest, between the towns of [[Espar]] and [[Tyrluk]], became a site of the deadly ambush. The bandits, in reality, assassins sent to murder King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] and make it looks like a simple mugging, strong onto the monarch of Cormyr and a small group of his loyal [[Purple Dragons]]. Unbeknown to the King nor the assassins, the Hunter's Hollow was a meeting spot of [[Irlgar Delbossan]], his men, sent to secure transportation of a scion of the [[Crownsilver]] family, and [[Florin Falconhand]], who tried to teach the said scion manners and the way of life in the realms. [[Narantha Crownsilver]] and Florin Falconhand walked into the ambush and joined the battle. One-Knife was among the assassins who attacked both the [[ranger]] and the young Crownsilver noble, but with the duo working together, One-Knife was slain. Subsequently, with the help of unexpected participants, the Battle of Hunter's Hollow was won and the King's life was saved.
