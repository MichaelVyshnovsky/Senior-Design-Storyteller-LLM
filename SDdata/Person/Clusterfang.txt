'''Clusterfang''' was a poor translation into [[Common]] of a particular [[deepspawn]]'s given name. It operated in the southern [[Sword Coast]] and [[Vilhon Reach]] regions in concert with the [[Twisted Rune]]. No one who knew of its existence could guess at why Clusterfang had allied itself with this organization of evil magic-users, but it obviously saw some benefit of doing so.

Clusterfang laired under the city of [[Zazesspur]], being the second deepspawn to do so.
