Clusterfang was a poor translation into Common of a particular deepspawns given name. It operated in the southern Sword Coast and Vilhon Reach regions in concert with the Twisted Rune. No one who knew of its existence could guess at why Clusterfang had allied itself with this organization of evil magic-users, but it obviously saw some benefit of doing so.
Clusterfang laired under the city of Zazesspur, being the second deepspawn to do so.
