'''Broryn Windstag''' was a noble in [[Cormyr]] and a heir of the [[Windstag]] noble house during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Lord Windstag was blustering and bold.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|237-239|23}}

==Description==
Windstag was big and florid.

==Abilities==
He was good with a blade, and even better at hunting.

==Relationships==
Lord [[Traevyn Illance]] had been a friend and creditor of [[Broryn Windstag]]'s father; he was the one person Lord Windstag had trusted from youth. He was finally recruited into Illance's faction, which sought to have a Royal Magician from elsewhere mind-controlling the king for the benefit of the nobles.

Lord Windstag had a constant crony, the young [[Delasko Sornstern]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|364|34}}

Broryn Windstag was a heir of House [[Windstag]].

==History==
Broryn Windstag was a guest at the [[Open Feast]] of [[Mirtul 26]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}. He was present for the conversation between [[Kathkote Dawntard]] and [[Orstramagrus]], which went well, to his disappointment.

Sornstern was with Broryn Windstag and Kathkote Dawntard when the three of them entered, drunk, to the [[Dragonriders Club]], started a brawl, and attacked [[Delnor]] a palace messenger there, almost fighting [[Arclath Delcastle]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|217-221|21}} They were later repelled by the arrival of the city watch of [[Suzail]],{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|230-231|22}}

After the meeting, they fled towards Marlin Stormserpent's residence at [[Stormserpent Towers]], who involved them at that time in his intrigues involving ''[[blueflame item]]s''.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|265-266|25}}

Later, the young lords Dawntard, Sornstern and Windstag carried out a frantic search for the axe; so energetic and haphazard their search was, that they themselves expressly did not understand the intensity of their own actions.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|326-327|31}} Among other actions during their search, they'd offered large amounts of coin in a number of taverns frequented by the nobility, including [[the Rose and Dragon]], [[the Servant Exalted]], and [[the Hrelto]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|331-332|32}} They were unknowingly controlled by the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]], who had them target Lord [[Barandror Murandrake]]'s residence, where they finally found the axe.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|334-335|32}}  Though they were pursued by the War Wizard [[Glathra Barcantle]] and Swordcaptain [[Dralkin]] along the way, and nearly ran out of breath, a spell whisked them away, teleporting them nearly all the way to Stormserpent Towers.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|337-338|32}} After delivering the axe to Marlin Stormserpent, his companions fainted; Windstag delivered the axe with little explanation.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|340-342|32}}

However, the axe brought forth [[Mirt]], one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] of the previous century, rather than one of the ghosts they sought after. Marlin and Windstag fought him, having decided they could at least seize as many of his properties as possible, even if he could not be commanded. He defeated them soundly,{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|343-346|33}} and injured Windstag greatly.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|366-367|35}}

Broryn Windstag was not at the [[Council of the Dragon]]; he heard of the calamitous consequences at Court later, at his home in [[Staghaven House]], where he was hosting [[Irlin Stonestable]]. [[Mellast Ormblade]] and [[Sacrast Handragon]] arrived later, confirming what his servant, Aereld, first told him.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|124-125|13}} While mooted there, they were subsequently joined by [[Traevyn Illance]], [[Osbur]], and Marlin Stormserpent; Traevyn recruited them into his faction.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|141-142|15}} After the moot, Lord Delasko Sornstern had a brief talk with Broryn Windstag about his father [[Haedro Sornstern]]'s learnings about [[blueflame item]]s and [[the Imprisoners]], back at the [[Sornstern Family Gardens]]. Unknown to them, they were being spied on by the [[highknight]] Sir [[Talonar Winter]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|181-183|19}}

Broryn Windstag was found dead later at Staghaven House alongside all its inhabitants, his body cursed so that anyone who tried to pry information out of it was struck down with insanity.
