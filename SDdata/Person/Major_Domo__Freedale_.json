        "name": "Major Domo<ref group=\"note\" name=\"name\">This character exists as such only in ''Introduction to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'', where his name is capitalized as \"Major Domo\" consistently. In the original version of the adventure he appearing in, which is included in ''First Quest'', Netheril only once refers to a \"Major domo\", not capitalizing the \"d\". This article is written to refer to that character, who is given stats in ''Introduction''. However, there remains the possibility that Major Domo is not his name, but his job. This wiki article is written attempting to make this ambiguity clear. One sentence in the text runs \"Netheril has three servants: Major Domo (Netheril's manservant) and two guards\". The use of Major Domo immediately after the colon and capitalized suggests it is a proper noun, a rank and name, or two names, as a simple job would almost certainly be preceded by an article ('a' or 'the'), and not capitalized. Though the same writers worked on both books and thus the change is most likely intentional, typographic errors are still possible, and knowing that the original used the words as a job title rather than as a name, the possibility that it was actually a job title cannot be discounted.",
