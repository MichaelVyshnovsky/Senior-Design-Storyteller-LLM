        "mainbody": "Vheod Runechild was a cambion of the mid–14 century DR.\nHe had long brick-red hair, scarred hands, and a \"living\" red mark that was in flux on his body. Vheod called it \"the Taint\". He wore spiked metal armor, a simple cloth cape, and used a long sword.\nHe was a known companion of Melann Brandish and Whitlock Brandish.\nHe escaped from the Abyss and arrived in Faerûn in Archendale, where he met his future companions.\nVheod had an inherent ability to levitate, which was the result of his tanarri lineage. He also had access to spells he learned from an ancient book, including a way to manipulate and restore the vampiric briars that grew in the Fields of Night Unseen in the Abyss. He was able to conjure flames to create a fire that helped him to survive in the wild."
