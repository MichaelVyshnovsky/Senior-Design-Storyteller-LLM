All his life, Vheod could find no answers as to its meaning, least of all from the Taint itself.''<ref>}}",
        "Description": "He had long brick-red hair, scarred hands, and a \"living\" red mark that was in flux on his body. Vheod called it \"the Taint\". He wore spiked metal [[armor]], a simple cloth cape, and used a [[long sword]].<ref>",

        "History": "He escaped from the [[Abyss]] and arrived in [[Faerûn]] in [[Archendale]], where he met his future companions.<ref>",
        "Abilities": "Vheod had an inherent ability to levitate, which was the result of his [[tanar'ri]] lineage. He also had access to [[spell]]s he learned from an ancient [[book]], including a way to manipulate and restore the vampiric briars that grew in the [[Fields of Night Unseen]] in the Abyss.<ref> He was able to conjure flames to create a fire that helped him to survive in the wild.<ref>"
