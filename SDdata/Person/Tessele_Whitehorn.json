        "mainbody": "'''Tessele Whitehorn''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Oghma]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], having ascended to the rank of Lorekeeper Venturer within the [[Leaves of Learning]], a temple/library in the city of [[Highmoon]] in [[Deepingdale]]. Under her leadership, two Lorekeepers and four Seekers of the Binder maintained watch over the Leaves' collected works and supervised visitors who made use of their services.{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|6}}",
        "Personality": "While she didn't often find combat during her service in the Leaves' walls, Tessele possessed the keen mind of a tactician. She maintained a daily exercise regimen and insisted her fellow [[priests]] join in the routine.",
        "History": {
            "Visions": "Around the year [[1372 DR]], Tessele began having repeated nightmares of a [[meteor|falling star]] crashing into the forests of the Dalelands in her sleep. She saw the trees and the [[elves]] that lived within them engulfed in immolation. Unbeknownst to the senior Lorekeeper, these dreams were not prophetic, but rather visions pertaining to the destruction of an ancient elven civilization. Known as the [[Uvaeren|Lorelands of Uvaeren]], this former beacon of enlightenment was located where [[Mistledale]] stood, thousands of years before, dating back to a couple millennia before the raising of the ''[[mythal]]'' at [[Myth Drannor]]. She was unsure as to what these dreams meant and believed that knowledge rested solely with Oghma."
