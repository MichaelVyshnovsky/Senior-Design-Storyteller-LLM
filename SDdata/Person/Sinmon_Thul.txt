Sinmon Thul was one of the leaders of the Order of the Blue Boar, a mercenary recruiting company in Amn.
Sinmon was a big man with brown hair and a bushy mustache. He did not like the formalities of nobility nor the bureaucracy involved in being one of the Boars Heads.
Sinmon was a leading member of the Order of the Blue Boar. He was a tactical genius and so was often put in charge of field operations. In his younger (and less heavy-set) days, he would lead cavalry charges.
Sinmon hailed from an Amnian mercantile family, but as third son he needed to make his own fortune. He gained fame and money leading a mercenary company in the Sword Coast until joining the Order.
