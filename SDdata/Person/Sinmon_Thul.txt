'''Sinmon Thul''' was one of the leaders of the [[Order of the Blue Boar]], a mercenary recruiting company in [[Amn]].

==Description==
Sinmon was a big man with brown hair and a bushy mustache. He did not like the formalities of nobility nor the bureaucracy involved in being one of the [[Boar's Head]]s.

==Activities==
Sinmon was a leading member of the [[Order of the Blue Boar]]. He was a tactical genius and so was often put in charge of field operations. In his younger (and less heavy-set) days, he would lead cavalry charges.

==History==
Sinmon hailed from an Amnian mercantile family, but as third son he needed to make his own fortune. He gained fame and money leading a mercenary company in the [[Sword Coast]] until joining the Order.
