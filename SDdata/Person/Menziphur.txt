Menziphur was the court alchemist in Cormyr as of the late 15 century DR.
The man could be extremely sneaky hopefully, he could do alchemy as well.
Glathra Barcantle sought out Menziphur in the aftermath of the Council of the Dragon briefly, before she was sidetracked by the presence of Arclath Delcastle and Amarune Whitewave.
