'''Mogdor''' was a mysterious arch-nemesis of [[Delfen Ondabarl]], a [[wizard]] from [[Daggerford]], and the former master of the wizard's [[familiar]] [[Sujit]].

==Description==
Mogdor appeared to be a strange being. He resembled a dark-skinned [[half-elf]], but he also had small horns and demonic wings on his back. His true nature remained a mystery, possibly indicating him having the blood of creatures from the [[lower planes]]. He was an evil and cruel man.

==History==
Not much of Mogdor's history was known, apart from the fact that he hailed from the ice plains of [[Etabalon]]. However, at some point before [[1372 DR]], he was the master of Sujit the [[imp]]. Eventually, the imp was rescued from servitude by Delfen "Yellowknife" Ondabarl and taken into his care as a familiar and a friend. Mogdor was a proud creature and continually perused the duo trying to reclaim his lost possession, eventually becoming Delfen's arch-nemesis.

In 1372 DR, Mogdor offered a hefty sum of [[coin]] to [[Erik the Fin]], a [[thief]] from Daggerford, in exchange for capturing Sujit. The rogue placed a trap for the curious imp outside the wizard's home in [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]]. He set up a music box chest in an alley, king sure the imp could hear it. Sujit investigated the music and became trapped in the chest. However, Erik managed to stop the container into [[Delimbiyr River]], losing his heft bounty. He sought help to recover the lost chest, recruiting the [[Hero of Daggerford]] without revealing the chest's contents.

The Hero eventually recovered the missing container and, realizing that Delfen's fiend was inside, returned it to the wizard of the Sorceller's Encapsulate. Delfen Yellowknife conceited the renege plot on his arch-genesis and gave the Hero a chest with a surprise inside to be returned to Mogdor. When Sujit's old master opened the chest, he awakened a [[demilich]], [[Extallimix]], who was trapped in an orb in the years past. Aggravated over his imprisonment, Extallimix blasted Mogdor with deadly magics, seemingly killing him.
