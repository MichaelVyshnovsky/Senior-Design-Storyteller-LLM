'''Connor the Clever''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]).

After Princess [[Roxanna of Edenvale|Roxanna]] of [[Edenvale]] declared she would only marry one who could best her in battle, Connor the Clever was one of the men who took up the challenge in the [[Matchmaker Mayhem]] conflict. After her defeat of [[Bryan the Bold]], Roxanna withdrew to the [[Web Mountains]] to prevent further assaults on the realm. However, Connor the Clever tracked Roxanna down and insisted she honor her challenge and face him in a bloodforge battle.
