Nrymm Aumar was the youngest of the Warring Princes of Athalantar.
Nrymm was very young when his father, and king, died and he was raised by the women of the court.
When magelords seized control, Nrymm disappeared. Magelord records indicated that he was turned into an otyugh by the magelords, then kept in the middens of Athalgard, the royal castle in Hastarl, so that they had another blood heir of Uthgrael in their power, other than Belaur Aumar.
Nrymm was slain in otyugh form in 238 DR by one of the mages hired by Felodar Aumar.
