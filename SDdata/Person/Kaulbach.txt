Kaulbach was an apprentice priest of Tyr inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Kaulbach was interested in finding a mentor and was oblivious to the fact that she could probably attract followers of her own. She wished to establish a shine, and eventually a full-fledged temple, dedicated to Tyr within Daggerford.
She lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford at the intersection of Water Street and Hill Road near the River Gate.
