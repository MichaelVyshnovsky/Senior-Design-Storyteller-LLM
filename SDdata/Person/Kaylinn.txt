Kaylinn was a cleric of Kelemvor in the city of Ormpetarr in Sespech.
Kaylinn was short, with wide hips and full breasts.  Her head was shaven, except for a characteristic sidelock of auburn hair wrapped in thin white leather straps that went down past her shoulder. At the base of her skull where it met the spine was a blue outlined inked tattoo depicting the sign of Kelemvor, a skeletal hand holding a set of scales.
In 1479 DR, she served as high priestess in Ormpetarr.
