In [[1372 DR]], [[Ssipriina Zauvirr|Ssipriina]] led [[House Zauvirr]] in an attempt to defeat House Melarn. She hired the [[duergar]] mercenary band [[Clan Xornbane]], with the help of [[Zammzt]], to assist. She took over the [[Black Claw Mercantile Company]] storehouse, which was operated by House Zauvirr, House Melarn, and the [[Menzoberranzan|Menzoberranyr]] [[House Baenre]]. She ordered her guards to kill Drisinil. Clan Xornbane attacked and destroyed House Melarn, causing it to fall into the cavern of the city as the entire city was destroyed. Drisinil's daughter, [[Halisstra Melarn]], escaped and joined [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s group investigating the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Relationships==
Her known children were:
* [[Halisstra Melarn]]
* [[Q'arlynd Melarn]]
* [[Tellik Melarn]]
