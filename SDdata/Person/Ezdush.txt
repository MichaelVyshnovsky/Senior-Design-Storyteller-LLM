'''Ezdush''' was a [[sage]] and a servant of [[Immurk]] living in the [[Pirate Isles]] during the midâ€“12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Ezdush researched the strange and gigantic carvings found on the cliff faces of the large mountain on the isle of [[Paldir]]. The lack of hand or footholds on the carvings led him to believe them to be made from powerful [[magic]] in a single day.
