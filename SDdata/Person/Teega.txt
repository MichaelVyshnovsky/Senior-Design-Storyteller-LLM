'''Teega''' was a blacksmith who worked at the small smithy of the [[Wayside Inn]] in the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]]. She was secretly a member of a [[Talos]] cult.

==Description==
Teega was a burly [[Illuskan]] woman, strong enough to wield a hammer in each hand. She wore a pair of bronze bracers fashioned like three lightning bolts and crafted jewelry in her leisure time. Teega's anvil was shaped like a dolphin.

==Relationships==
Teega was a long-time friend of [[Backes Dunfield]], the bartender of the Wayside Inn. She encountered him after his career as a pirate had come to an end. Both were members of the cult of Talos lead by [[Fheralai Stormsworn]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Wayside Inn was attacked by [[undead]] that had been created by a cult of [[Myrkul]] competing with the Talos cult for influence in the region. A group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.

Later, the cult of Talos took over the Wayside inn. The guests of the inn were impaled as sacrifices to the Stormbringer. The cultists tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos and summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn in the process. Their goal was to gain control over the weather in the region. Three [[Air elemental myrmidon|air elemental myrmidons]] were conjured into suits of [[Plate mail|plate]] armor that Teega had forged. The ritual also animated a [[statue of Talos]] in the cellar that was magically connected to Teega's life force via her bracers. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able to stop the ritual in time. However, the Talos cultists successfully kidnapped [[Tarbin Tul]], a local bard.
