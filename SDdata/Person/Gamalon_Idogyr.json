        "mainbody": "Lord Gamalon Idogyr was the Count of Spellshire and the Court Sage of Tethyr. Formerly, he had been the most powerful wizard living on the Rock of Bral,\nGamalon had old scars across his face He was one of the oldest nobles in Queen Zaranda Stars court.\nGamalon so commonly had ioun stones orbiting his head that he had earned the nickname \"Gemhead\".\nBecause he was a landowner, Gamalon was considered a noble of Bral before returning to Tethyr to become a noble there as well.\nGamalon was a known expert on magic items, including historical magical artifacts. Indeed, even the spacefaring race known as the Arcane dealt with him directly and had taught him some of their spelljamming magic.\nGamalons friendliness disguised the fact that he was an exceptionally powerful wizard. He was tactful and thoughtful to the point of annoyance. His friendliness and tactfulness masked his great pride, as he knew how powerful he was.\nHe loved difficult challenges and relished solving them. He was a family man and preferred spending time at his home with his wife and family. He did not usually welcome strangers into his home, but he enjoyed sharing tales with them within his shop on Bral.\nGamalons magic gem eye acted as a gem of seeing in addition to providing him with darkvision and the ability to detect magic.\nHe also possessed bracers of defense, a cloak of the bat, and boots of star striding and carried a staff of the magi.\nWhile living in the city of Bral, Gamalon was a landowner and ran a magical curios shop, His private estate home was directly behind his shop and had a large courtyard and included several buildings.\nGamalons official abode upon returning to Toril was the manor of Shildamere, which had belonged to his family.\nAs a merchant, Gamalon both collected and sold rare and unique magical items, focusing on those related to travel through the Sea of Night.\nAs Court Sage of the Kingdom of Tethyr, Gamalon served as the official scholar for the court. He commonly worked with foreign sages. He had many connections among the powerful mages of Faerûn, including members of the Harpers, and could pass information to or from them for the King and Queen. His activities as Court Sage made Lord Inselm Hhune especially suspicious of him.\nGamalon was the son of Count Darud Idogyr. He was one of seven children. His mothers name was Arana. He also had an older half-elven half-brother through his father named Araneth Idogyr, who was also a wizard.\nGamalons wife was Mynda Idogyr. They had been married for 34 years at that time.\nThey had two children. The eldest was their son Perigon, who was born in 1343 DR. Their daughter, born in 1346 DR, was named Lara. She was Gamalons favorite and his heir, as Perigon gave up his birthright to dedicate his life to serve The Triad.\nHe also had a son-in-law, named Arn Gyrfalcon, the husband of his daughter Lara, Vajra Safahr, who bore the famed Blackstaff in 1479 DR, was a descendant of Gamalons through Arn Gyrfalcon.\nGamalon was friends with Elminster Aumar (through the line of Khelbens daughter Kessydra,) and Laeral Silverhand for this he was secretly recruited into the Moonstars around 1370. He also was friends with wizards even in other crystal spheres.\nDuring his younger days, Gamalon adventured with a dwarf known as Capn Gyudd. After they both retired from adventuring, they each kept shops in the city of Bral and sent potential customers to each others shops.\nFrom 1369 DR, Gamalon was a tutor and protector of the brass dragon Alaerurrgos, whose father and siblings had been slain by the blue wyrm Iryklathagra.\nthumb|Gamalon Idogyr in his crimson robes.\nMuch of Gamalons family, including his mother and two oldest siblings, were killed in 1313 DR, when Gamalon was only eleven-years-old, during a series of feuds that occurred between his family and Clan Trecask from the Duchy of Dusk.\nGamalon was educated at the Mystics Academy in Erlkazar.\nSometime in his early life, Gamalon became an adventurer and explorer.\nIn 1333 DR, Gamalon left Toril and his homeland of Tethyr and lived on the Rock of Bral, one of the Tears of Selûne, where he maintained a curio shop. At some point while there, Gamalon discovered a secret stash of orbus rings, which enhanced the power of spelljamming helmsmen. For a time, Gamalon was the only seller of such rings.\nDuring his time on the Rock of Bral,  he became enamored with a merchants daughter, named Mynda. After four years of pursuing her, she finally agreed to become his wife.\nDuring the Ten Black Days of Eleint, one of his sisters and one of his brothers and most of the members of their families were slain for being nobility.\nGamalon returned to Toril, to his grandfathers lands in County Spellshire near the Forest of Tethir, sometime before the First Siege of Myratma. He provided magical support in both the First and Second Sieges, and for this, he was rewarded his grandfathers old lands to rule over as count.\nIn 1370 DR, Gamalon, his daughter, her husband, and Timoth Eyesbright traveled to Trailstone after that town defected from Amn. These four helped train the citizens in defending their city.\nIn 1374 DR, Gamalon planned to break the \"Tethyr Curse\" by staying in Waterdeep over the winter. He planned to give guest lectures at Blackstaff Tower.\nGamalon Idogyr, Raegar, and Damlath survived, but Gamalons wife, many guards, and other bystanders were killed in the incident. While Gamalon was laid low, Damlath (who was possessed by the lich Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk) stole his gem eye.\nGamalon joined in Khelbens plan to stop Priamon, and the lich was defeated. At the end of the ordeal, Mystra herself rewarded him by giving him a new magical left eye.\nGamalon was allergic to cats, including tressym."
