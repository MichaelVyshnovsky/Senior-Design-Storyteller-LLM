        "mainbody": "Dom was the baker at Thistleflame Manor and servant of Lord Partic Thistle circa 1369 DR.\nDom was a huge, round man, with a bald head and a red face.\nHe was hugely self-important and arrogant, and had a monomaniacal focus on baking to the exclusion of all other topics.\nDom was the Manors baker, and spent much of his time baking or preparing to bake. He dominated the kitchen when he worked, demanding utter quiet so that he could concentrate. Despite his histrionics, or perhaps because of them, his culinary creations were legendary in Suzail.\nThe cooks in the kitchen, Nora, Dora and Malda found his antics tiresome."
