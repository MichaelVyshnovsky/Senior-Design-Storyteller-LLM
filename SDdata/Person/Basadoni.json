        "History": "Basadoni accepted the young [[Artemis Entreri]] as a member of his guild, though he later entered the service of Pasha [[Pook]].\n\nWhen Enteri returned to Calimport in the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, Pasha Basadoni invited him to join again, but Entreri refused. Soon after, some high-ranking members of House Basadoni tried to kill Entreri to maintain the guild's prestige, but Entreri killed them all&mdash;at the price of involving [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. At last Entreri and the [[drow]] assaulted Basadoni's palace and confronted the pasha. Basadoni acknowledged the power of the drow and offered instead an alliance with them with himself as figurehead leader and Jarlaxle commanding from shadows. Entreri seemingly accepted the pact but then killed Basadoni in cold blood, claiming the leadership of House Basadoni for himself.",
