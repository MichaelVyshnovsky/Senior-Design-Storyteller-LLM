        "mainbody": "Hadrion, who recently changed his name from Hadiron, was a half-elf thief inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nRumors abounded that Hadrion had dwarf blood running through his veins. He changed his name from Hadiron with the hopes that the removal of the \"iron\" from his name would dissuade such rumors, but it ultimately proved to make no difference."
