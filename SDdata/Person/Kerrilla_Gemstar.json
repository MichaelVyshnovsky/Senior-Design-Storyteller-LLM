        "History": "In the [[1372 DR|Year of the Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], a dead dwarven prospector named [[Bromgart]] found on the road was brought back to Hospice. Before the priests buried him, Kerrilla used a ''[[speak with dead]]'' and learned that Bromgart had encountered a \"beast of blackness\" and \"dark\nclerics\" in the [[Ironhand Mines]].\n\nShe was still at her post sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]]."
