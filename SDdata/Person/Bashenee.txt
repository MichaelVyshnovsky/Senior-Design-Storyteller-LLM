'''Bashenee''' was a [[githzerai]] craftsman.

In a past age, in a realm beyond the [[Astral Plane]], Bashenee created an ''[[incandescent blue ioun stone (githzerai)|incandescent blue ioun stone]]'' for a great githzerai [[monk]], who later fell in battle with [[githyanki]]. The githyanki took the stone for their own.
