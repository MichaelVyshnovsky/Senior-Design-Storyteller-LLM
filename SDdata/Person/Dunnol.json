He carried with him a lashing rod, that he used to punish laboring slaves.\nUnder the supervision of True Soul Nere, Dunnol served as a taskmaster for the cult of the Absolute. He chided and beat the deep gnome slaves they used to excavate long-lost ruins within the Underdark.\nIn the , Dunnol was among the Absolutes novices that journeyed into the ruins of Grymforge in search of an old temple of Shar that remained within its depths."
