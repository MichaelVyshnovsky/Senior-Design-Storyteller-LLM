'''Lucretious''' was the ringmaster of the [[Circus of the Last Days]]. She was a necromancer who enjoyed animating [[undead]] performers, though she also hired [[Mummy|mummies]], [[redcap]]s, [[djinn]], [[dryad]]s, [[elemental]]s, and more.

==Description==
Lucretious was a [[high elf]] with lilac skin; long, black hair; and dark eyes. She wore a great deal of make-up and presented herself in a dark purple gown with black feathers and gold accessories. By her own description, she was ancient.

==Personality==
As a ringmaster, Lucretious was ostentatiously charismatic and flamboyant.

==Abilities==
Lucretious was capable of raising [[Skeleton|skeletal]] minions and instructing them to perform dance routines, though they sometimes struggled with this. Though her circus was a mainstay in [[Baldur's Gate]], she apparently possessed the means to move it between [[planes]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], she claimed to be an ancient being, having seen "stars explode and civilizations fall," though the extent and truth of this claim is unknown.

==Relationships==
Lucretious had two [[crawling claw]] pets: [[Itchy]] and [[Scratchy]].
