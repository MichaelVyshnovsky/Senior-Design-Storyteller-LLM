Lucretious was the ringmaster of the Circus of the Last Days. She was a necromancer who enjoyed animating undead performers, though she also hired mummies, redcaps, djinn, dryads, elementals, and more.
Lucretious was a high elf with lilac skin long, black hair and dark eyes. She wore a great deal of make-up and presented herself in a dark purple gown with black feathers and gold accessories. By her own description, she was ancient.
As a ringmaster, Lucretious was ostentatiously charismatic and flamboyant.
Lucretious was capable of raising skeletal minions and instructing them to perform dance routines, though they sometimes struggled with this. Though her circus was a mainstay in Baldurs Gate, she apparently possessed the means to move it between planes.
In the late 15 century DR, she claimed to be an ancient being, having seen "stars explode and civilizations fall," though the extent and truth of this claim is unknown.
Lucretious had two crawling claw pets Itchy and Scratchy.
