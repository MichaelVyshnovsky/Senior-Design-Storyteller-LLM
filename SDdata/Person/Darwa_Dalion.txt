Darwa Dalion was a Red Wizard of Thay spy residing in Daggerford around 1480 DR.
As part of her cover in Daggerford, Darwa acted as a bubudow, a kind of witch that used medical herbs.
Five years before, Darwa infiltrated Daggerford under orders of the senior Red Wizard Arvik Zaltos. Darwa worked as a Thayan spy in Daggerford for two years.
Around 1480 DR, Arvik Zaltos instructed Darwa to recover the earth key from inside the Ambergul Crypt. She gathered a group of thugs loyal to her and from Illefarn Arvik sent to help her the dwarf Thord Ironaxe, his half-orc son Grit, and the ogrillon Lump.
However, when Darwa and her henchmen found the altar to Ogremoch she tried to unlock the earth key with force and a magical trap turned her into stone.
Darwa was one of the four apprentices of Arvik Zaltos, the only non-necromancer.
