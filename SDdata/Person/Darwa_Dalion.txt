'''Darwa Dalion''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] spy residing in [[Daggerford]] around [[1480 DR]].
  
==Activities==
As part of her cover in Daggerford, Darwa acted as a [[bubudow]], a kind of [[witch]] that used medical [[herb]]s.

==History==
Five years before, Darwa infiltrated Daggerford under orders of the senior Red Wizard [[Arvik Zaltos]]. Darwa worked as a [[Thayan]] spy in Daggerford for two years.

Around [[1480 DR]], Arvik Zaltos instructed Darwa to recover the [[earth key]] from inside the [[Ambergul Crypt]]. She gathered a group of thugs loyal to her and from [[Illefarn]] Arvik sent to help her the [[dwarf]] [[Thord Ironaxe]], his [[half-orc]] son [[Grit]], and the [[ogrillon]] [[Lump]].

However, when Darwa and her henchmen found the altar to [[Ogremoch]] she tried to unlock the earth key with force and a magical trap turned her into stone.

==Relationship==
Darwa was one of the four apprentices of Arvik Zaltos, the only non-necromancer.
