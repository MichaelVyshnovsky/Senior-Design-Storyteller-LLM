        "Personality": "He was rather confident in his spell-dueling skills.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|517-518|Prologue}} Also, he was gruffly sardonic.",

        "Relationships": "He was part of a group of adventurers together with [[Nuressa]], [[Folossan]], and [[Amandarn]]. He later took on an apprentice, [[Rauntlavon]], and became a couple with Nuressa.",
        "History": "On a warm day in [[Mirtul]] in the {{yearlinkName|759}}, the group Iyriklaunavan was with ran into a [[Netherese]] tomb. In the main room, they spotted a [[Elminster|body]] floating up near the ceiling, and four pillars in a large room. As Iyriklaunavan cast a spell to bring down the corpse, the pillars sprouted hundreds of eyes and attacked them.\n\nAfter managing to get away from the pillars of eyes, which the corpse attacked and destroyed after animating, the body approached the adventurers and asked what year it was. Nuressa replied with the date, to which the corpse immediately ''teleported'' away. The team decided to flee the tomb and leave it unexplored.\n\nLater, it turned out that Amandarn had gambled all their money away shortly afterward; Folossan nearly killed him for it. The two stole back some of their coin, got caught, and fled. After spending the evening under an altar to [[Mystra]], they found a small fortune and a deed to a castle by morning, which they presented to the rest of the team. Iyriklaunavan magically verified their account.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|732-736|19}}\n\nDuring the chaos of [[the Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Iyriklaunavan had taken on an apprentice, Rauntlavon. They attempted a ''farscrying'' together, with Iyrik casting it and Rauntlavon steadying it. However, the spell failed, almost causing damage to the castle room in which they resided. As Nuressa came to him, he revealed that they'd been able to farscry that [[Azuth]] had just been magically attacked in the presence of a [[Chosen of Mystra]], and that said Chosen was the body that had escaped back when they were in the Netherese tomb. Iyriklaunavan saw fit to reveal to her they'd been blessed by Mystra, and the process of their acquisition of the castle. More importantly, Rauntlavon noted that the chaos of the Art, if it worsened, would lead to the destruction of their castle, as it had been buttressed with magic itself."
