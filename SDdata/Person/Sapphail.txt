'''Sapphail''' was powerful [[wizard]] who lived some time during the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sapphail battled the wizard [[Narsel]] in an epic duel in the skies over [[Ironmaster]]. She ended up slaying her rival by unleashing a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' on him. After his charred corpse fell to the ground, Sapphail retrieved the badly damaged remains of the ''[[Tome of Rathdaen]]'' which she later passed on to her apprentices.
