'''Jarthon Drael''' was a male [[half-elf]] [[werebadger]] from the [[Moonwood]] and was the [[Bloodmaster]] for the tribe of the [[People of the Black Blood]] living there.

==Personality==
Clear of thought and adaptable, Jarthon took great relish in battle and stealth and outwitting his foes alike. Although he was ruthless in combat, often prone to flying in a rage when injured, Jarthon was not above fleeing an unnecessary battle if it could mean his death. 

==Abilities==
As a werebadger, Jarthon could assume the form of a [[dire badger]] when pressed in combat. Jarthon's skills as a hunter were also accomplished enough to earn him leadership of the Moonwood tribe of the People of the Black Blood.

==Possessions==
Jarthon was spartanly equipped, usually with only his [[mithral]] [[chain shirt]], [[magic]] [[longsword]], [[dagger]], and [[crossbow]] (albeit with a few [[silver]]-tipped [[bolt]]s) for protection.

However, Jarthon had amassed a small stash of [[gold]], [[gem]]s, and a couple of [[potion]]s of ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' back in [[Claw Hollow]].

==History==
Jarthon Drael was once a half-elf from [[Silverymoon]] who used his skills to hunt down [[lycanthropes]] from the People of the Black Blood in the Moonwood, hoping he could protect the people of his city from them. However, on one of his hunts, he was bitten during a werebadger attack and eventually contracted [[lycanthropy]], becoming the very thing he hunted.

Rising to leadership of the Moonwood tribe and based at the refuge of Claw Hollow, Jarthon became a barb in the flank of the people of the [[Silver Marches]]. In [[1372 DR]], he led his tribe in a campaign against the people of [[Quaervarr]], abducting a woodcutter during one of Jarthon's monthly [[High Hunt]]s in the month of [[Kythorn]]. When the woodcutter's body was found it had a pinned note from Jarthon warning the town to cease expanding into his territory.
