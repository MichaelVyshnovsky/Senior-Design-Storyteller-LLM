She took comfort in various laws and rituals of magic. A rather lonely woman, not given to dealing with crowds.\nTwilitha strove to promote the development of magical societies, believing they were the only answer to the questions of life. She was willing to do most anything to achieve this goal, even pushing through her dislike of large crowds."
