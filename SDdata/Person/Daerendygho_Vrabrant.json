        "History": "After the fugitive mage [[Elminster Aumar]] spread the word that The Blue Flame, actually his relative [[Amarune Whitewave]], was going to dance in the club, Vrabrant protested that he would not host any such events, only to find himself largely ignored. He tried hiring extra security, but after learning that his extra security was being bribed to certainty by the nobles in his club and by other nobles too, he resorted to asking for help from the [[War Wizards of Cormyr]], so as to keep himself from being jailed or ruined.\n\nHe had the stage remodeled smaller to make room for more chairs in anticipation of the performance, but much to his horror, some among the audience used spells to shift the closest seats to a nearby alleyway, giving themselves a clearer view of the smaller stage.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|319|34}}"
