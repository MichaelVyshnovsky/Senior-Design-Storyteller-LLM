'''Silifrey the Spraystrider''' was an [[Illuskan]] [[wizard]] of around the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]]. She was rumored to practice dangerous dark [[magic]].

==History==
According to the ''[[Hegredathas]]'', a written history of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], Silifrey commissioned the master dwarven builder [[Iirikos Stoneshoulder]] to build the [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]]. However, his [[elf|elven]] friends had heard the rumors and warned and pleaded with him not to. Iirikos ignored them, leaving them bewildered by his choice, and built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned [[elemental]]s. But, unknown to her, he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.

However, by the 14{{th}} century DR, it was still feared that Silifrey the Spraystrider had cursed the Granite Tower or that her vengeful [[ghost]] still haunted it. They even suggested her spirit sometimes went on rampages and was responsible for the regular disappearances of the populace of the village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] that had sprung up around the tower.
