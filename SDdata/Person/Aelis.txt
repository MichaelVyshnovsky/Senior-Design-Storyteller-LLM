'''Aelis''' was an [[archdruid]] of the [[Shadow Druids]] that dwelled within the [[Cloak Wood]] forest during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Once cloistered, the Emerald Grove will be the Shadow Druids' domain, and you its First Druid.}}

==Personality==
Aelis held in high rergard the memory of [[Faldorn]], one of the Shadow Druids' earliest leaders, back in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Aelis used the threat of a growing [[Cult of the Absolute|goblinoid army]], to strike out at other druidic groves across the [[Sword Coast]]. Working with [[Olodan]] and two other Shadow Druids, Aelis convinced [[Kagha]] of the [[Emerald Grove]] to begin the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'' ritual, which would protect and shield away the grove from any outsiders. Aelis planned to use that event to take the Emerald Grove under the control of the Shadow Druid circle.

As Aelis' plan was being carried out, they embarked from the Cloak Wood for the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
