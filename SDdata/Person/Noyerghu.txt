Noyerghu was a gnoll from [[Thay]] who accompanied the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Thegger Grynn]] in 1485 DR in taking control of the [[Phylund Lodge]]. Thanks to possession by the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]], Noyerghu replaced [[Flubnak]] as chieftain of the local gnolls and led them in raids against the caravans from [[Daggerford]].
