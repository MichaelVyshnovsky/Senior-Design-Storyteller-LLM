Oghalis was an industrious fire giant who led a tribe of hobgoblins in the Hullack Forest in 1369 DR.
Oghalis was a harsh and unforgiving leader, and punished any dissent or questioning of her orders severely. She seemed to be obsessed with harvesting lumber and copper from the forest, but refused to explain her motivations.
In battle, she fought with a huge greatsword and wore banded mail. She had a secret stash containing twelve 1,000 gp fire opals, a potion of longevity, a ring of warmth, an onyx dog figurine, and a much-too-small-to-use +3 handaxe.
In the , Oghalis and her four ogre enforcers took over a tribe of hobgoblins from their chief Gugak Thul and their shaman Hakaakatar, aiming to use them for a secret mission she had been assigned. She separated the young and female hobgoblins from the main body, and had them encamped separately near the Thunder Gap until her goals were reached.
In the Hullack Forest, she had the hobgoblins clear-cut as much lumber as possible. When a rich vein of copper was discovered, she had a small mine and smelter built, and soon the camp began producing stacks of copper ingots as well. To increase production, they attempted to enslave the local centaurs and satyrs, but the woodland folk proved entirely unsuitable for underground mining and industrial smelting. The next attempt involving kidnapping and enslaving humans from the nearby town of Thunderstone, which resulted in Troyappa, Kenhart, Joelem, and Jonren working the smelter for her.
Before her operation could proceed for more than a few months, the kidnappings drew the attention of Cormyrean adventurers, who raided the encampment and freed her slaves.
