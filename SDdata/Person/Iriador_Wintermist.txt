'''Iriador Wintermist''', known as '''Garnet''', was a [[half-elven]] [[spellsinger]] and former [[Harpers|Harper]].

==Description==
Iriador had red hair and was over 300 years of age, although she was able to use magic to make herself appear somewhat younger.

==History==
Iriador was a member of the Harpers who fell during the [[Harpstar Wars]]. She was rescued by a [[druid]] and learned [[spellsong]]. She spent 200 years with [[wood elf|wood elves]].

In [[1364 DR]], Iriador (using the alias '''Garnet''') retrieved the [[Morninglark]] harp from  the [[green dragon]] [[Grimnoshtadrano]] in order to place a curse on the Harpers in revenge (or, in her mind, justice) for their meddling and lack of attention to lorekeeping. She used the harp to change bards' songs without their awareness, blight the crops around [[Waterdeep]], and turn popular opinion against the [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. Her plans were thwarted by Harper [[Danilo Thann]] and company, which included [[Elaith Craulnober]], as well as by Grimnoshtadrano, who carried her away just before her moment of triumph. However, her deeds were a contributing factor to the reopening of the bardic college, [[New Olamn]].

==Relationships==
An [[asperii]] served Iriador.
