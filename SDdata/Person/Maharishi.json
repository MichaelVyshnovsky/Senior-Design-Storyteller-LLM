She laired in the ruined [[Tashalan]] city of [[Procalith]]. Often adventurers in need of knowledge about the yuan-ti asked for her help: the normal procedure was to camp out for a night in the ruined city, writing their questions on papyrus or displaying the item that needed study without attempting to scry on the naga. If Maharishi was interested, she appeared in front of the adventurers."
