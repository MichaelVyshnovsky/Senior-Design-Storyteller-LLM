He was the ruler of the enclave of Lathery.\nVeridon elevated the city of Lathery to enclave status in 3357 NY (−502 DR).\nLathery fished the Narrow Sea by using its mythallar to teleport fish (and anything else) that passed under the enclave into special cold storage chambers. By 3400 NY (−459 DR), Veridon had improved upon Latherys fishing mythallar such that it could distinguish between certain creatures and send some to different holding tanks. which was then used to refrigerate the storage chambers.\nIn 3426 NY (−433 DR), the ancient white dragon Wintercloak flew under the city and found itself teleported into one of the cold storage chambers. It tore itself free and broke out into the city streets, but was confronted by Veridon and the citys arcanists. Veridon and a dozen others were killed by the dragons icy breath, before it was slain by the survivors.\nVeridon was a mage who developed a number of spells based around cold and fog.
