        "Personality": "Shornthal's abrupt manner of speaking, and his controversial views on how Faer没n should be governed, made him many enemies among the rulers of the continent.",
        "History": "Shornthal traveled extensive throughout Faer没n, attempting to convince the various lords and kings of their folly. He was usually greeted with arrows dangerous spells, none of which harmed him. [[Golem]]s were even sent against him, but he smashed them to bits.\n\nShornthal eventually perished in battle, but the historical accounts were vague on the exact nature of his death."
