        "mainbody": "Caliph Halima al-Wahsi was the ruler of Ajayib in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. \nHalima was tall and possessed a face said to be more perfect than a bright moon, eyes darker than a deep well, and a smile that could set fabric ablaze. She wore her thick hair down to the small of her back. Her hair was worn loose at court, but tied into a tight coil during combat.\nHalimas mental acuity was just as impressive as her beauty.\nThough Halima was a skilled askara and yearned for the thrill of battle, she took her duties at court seriously."
