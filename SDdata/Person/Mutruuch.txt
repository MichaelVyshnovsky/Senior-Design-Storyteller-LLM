'''Mutruuch''' was an [[orc]] veteran in [[1484 DR]].
  
==History==
In 1484 DR, during the [[War of the Silver Marches]], Mutruuch was a member of the [[orc]] army that besieged [[Mithral Hall]]. She and some orc minions accompanied [[Szordrin Xorlarrin]] to secretly infiltrate the Keep. Mutruuch and her minions remained behind to control the entrance to the tunnel. However, they were discovered and defeated by an adventuring party.
