        "mainbody": "'''Kuhl''' was a man from [[Vaasa]] that accompanied [[Vala Thorsdotter]] and other their countrymen on a journey to [[Western Heartlands|the west]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The burly Vaasan had a notably crooked nose.",
        "Personality": "Kuhl was prone to unwelcome leering, at least towards  the [[elven]] women he encountered in [[Evereska]].",
        "Possessions": "Like his fellow Vaasans, Kuhl was the proud wielder of a ''[[darksword]]'', a magical blade imbued with [[shadow magic]] power that only he or a member of his family could wield. Each Vaasan's sword had a unique characteristic to it, and Kuhl's blade would turn pale each night unless he doused it in [[mead]].",
        "Relationships": "He was very protective of Vala, the leader of the Vaasan expedition.",
        "History": "Kuhl and his fellow Vaasans ventured to the [[Greycloak Hills]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, to fulfill [[Bodvar]]'s oath to [[Melegaunt Tanthul]]. After traveling to [[Evereska]] and remaining in the [[elven]] city for a time,\n\nWhen the malevolent [[phaerimm]] besieged Evereska, Kuhl and the other Vaasans joined the call of battle. They fought valiantly during the [[Battle of Vine Vale]], and Kuhl was among the few to not suffer any debilitating injuries. He was the victim of mental sabotage however, when the enemies of the [[Army of the North]] corrupted the minds of those in the war camp, turning warriors against their fellows."
