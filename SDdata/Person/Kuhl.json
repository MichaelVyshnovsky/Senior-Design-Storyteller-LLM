        "mainbody": "Kuhl was a man from Vaasa that accompanied Vala Thorsdotter and other their countrymen on a journey to the west in the late 14 century DR.\nThe burly Vaasan had a notably crooked nose.\nKuhl was prone to unwelcome leering, at least towards  the elven women he encountered in Evereska.\nLike his fellow Vaasans, Kuhl was the proud wielder of a darksword, a magical blade imbued with shadow magic power that only he or a member of his family could wield. Each Vaasans sword had a unique characteristic to it, and Kuhls blade would turn pale each night unless he doused it in mead.\nHe was very protective of Vala, the leader of the Vaasan expedition.                                                   \nKuhl and his fellow Vaasans ventured to the Greycloak Hills in the , to fulfill Bodvars oath to Melegaunt Tanthul. After traveling to Evereska and remaining in the elven city for a time,\nWhen the malevolent phaerimm besieged Evereska, Kuhl and the other Vaasans joined the call of battle. They fought valiantly during the Battle of Vine Vale, and Kuhl was among the few to not suffer any debilitating injuries. He was the victim of mental sabotage however, when the enemies of the Army of the North corrupted the minds of those in the war camp, turning warriors against their fellows."
