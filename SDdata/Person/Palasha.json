While she was seen as haughty and demanding, Palasha merely did not warm to others easily and had trouble showing genuine emotions. She had the bad habit of snapping her fingers at others when she desired something from them.\nthumb|right|300px|Palasha meeting Billi Sharpe, from the world of Toril.\nPalasha had the unique ability to shape the form of water by means of her operatic, singing voice. \nOnce per day, she could summon a swarm of kippers and control them for up to a minutes time.\nShe spent much of her time lounging in a giant fishbowl by the Silversong Lake area of the carnival.\nPalasha was wholly in love with Candlefoot, the Witchlight Carnivals resident mime."
