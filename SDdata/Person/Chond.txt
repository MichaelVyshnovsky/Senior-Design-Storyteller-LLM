Chond was a merchant from the city of Calaunt in the Vast in the 14th century DR.
Chond partnered with six other merchants—Alvund of Ormpetarr, Dzunn of Sheirtalar, Jhasso of Baldurs Gate, Nammna of Milvarune, Pomphur of Almraiven, and Shield of Everlund—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Chonds own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Chond and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
