        "Rumors & Legends": "During his infiltration of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] in early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, Elminster was mind-scried by [[Thauvas]], a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]]. Rather than prevent the mind-reading, he conjured up the faces of two Cormaerils he knew, one of them Jhaunadyl, in the aftermath of some lovemaking. Thauvas was displeased by what he saw; whether it was a true memory of them, or one of them was Elminster, or the whole thing was a mental fabrication was ambiguous."
