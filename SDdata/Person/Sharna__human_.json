        "mainbody": "'''Sharna''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Helm]] who was uncommonly strong for her size.",
        "Description": "Sharna was a petite woman with symmetrical facial features, blue eyes, and long, brown hair.",
        "Possessions": "She used a pair of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' to boost her already considerable strength. Sharna also owned a suit of [[chain mail]], a shield, and a ''[[longsword of sharpness]]''.",
        "Activities": "The dissonance between Sharna's size and strength worked in her favor, and she occasionally used it to shame \"tough guys\" into worshiping Helm.\n\nSharna had plans to travel to [[Maztica]] to aid in converting the local populace to the Helmite faith."
