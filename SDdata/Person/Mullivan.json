        "mainbody": "'''Mullivan''' was a former adventurer and mind-thrall in [[Oryndoll]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Mullivan was a ranger and leader of an adventuring party from [[Almraiven]]. His mission soon became cleansing [[Calimshan]] and [[Tethyr]] from [[mind flayer]] influence.\n\nFinally, in the [[Forest of Mir]], they discovered caves to the [[Underdark]]. Incautiously, Mullivan lead his comrades down and they arrived at the gates of Oryndoll. Mullivan sacrificed his own life to permit to a handful of his friends to escape. Afterward, the survivors of that expedition renamed themselves the [[Scimitars of Mullivan]] and started a war against Oryndoll, directing many adventuring parties against illithids and continuing their cleansing of the surface from mind flayer influence.\n\nUnknown to his friends, however, Mullivan was aliveâ€”he was resurrected by illithids using a new [[psionic]] science similar to a ''[[raise dead]]'' spell. Thereafter, the illithids used Mullivan as a mind-thrall, but unknown to his illithid masters, the resurrection gave Mullivan some kind of psionic immunity and he kept a degree of free will. Mullivan then waited for the right time to escape."
