His understanding of magical forces surpassed that of all other mages at the time.\nGelthin eventually claimed a ruin somewhere in the Sword Coast north.\nBefore becoming the Magister, Gelthin was a backstreet potion brewer and amulet constructor in Calimshan. Afterwards, he took refuge in a ruin, together with a vampire, and worked with the magic of existing adventurers that died in his dungeon, using spells and quests for treasure in order to lure people to his lair. He claimed the magic of those the vampire slew.\nBefore becoming the Magister, Gelthin was a backstreet potion brewer and amulet constructor in Calimshan, born in the Sword Coast north. After being offered the position by Azuth, he moved back to the Sword Coast north, where he took residence in a ruin of an abandoned empire, striking a deal with a local vampire.\nHe took the magic of those whom the vampire killed, and experimented with it, looking to create spells which could be boosted by wearing certain magical amulets. Though he kept clear records, he achieved little and spread nothing before he was caught unaware by Hortil Droone and promptly slain without delay.\nMany believed Gelthins hideout was actually inhabited by a lich, including the one that eventually slew him."
