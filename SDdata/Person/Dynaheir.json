        "mainbody": "'''Dynaheir''' was a young [[Evoker|invoker]] in the [[wychlaran]] of [[Rashemen]] who undertook her ''[[dajemma]]'' to the far off region of the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was not alone on this journey, as she accompanied by her [[rashemaar berserker|berserker]] companion [[Minsc]] and his [[Miniature giant space hamster|hamster]] [[Boo]].\n\n{{quote|''Dynaheir. A witch of my homeland. She was to be the greatest of them, and I her protector. She was a fierce and independent cub - she did not think she needed mother-bear Minsc to protect 'her! And she was right. The elders sent us out into the world, thinking it would teach her to bow a little. But it was the world that bowed to Dynaheir, wherever she went, and Minsc blundered along behind.''|[[Minsc]]}}",
        "Personality": "Dynaheir was very confident, self-assured and possessed the sensibility of someone who lived long before her time. She could be very demanding of her companions, especially Minsc.",
        "Powers": "In addition to being a skilled invoker, Dynaheir possessed the innate [[spell]]-like ability to ''[[slow poison]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Although she respected Minsc, and he in turn proved his loyalty and dedication as her protector, she did doubt his sanity at times. She felt he was decidedly over protective at times.",
        "History": "Little was known about Dynaheir's past, other than she was originally from Rashemen and left the eastern realm for the [[West Faerûn]] alongside her bodyguard Minsc. The two traveled together all the way to the [[Sword Coast]], seeking out information about the [[Bhaalspawn]]. At the same time, Dynaheir was being hunted by a [[conjurer]] from the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] named [[Edwin Odesseiron]].\n\nSome time in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Dynaheir and Minsc became separated in their journey and the witch of Rashemen was taken captive by a band of [[gnoll]]s. They took the young wychlaran to their stronghold west of the [[Bear River]] in the region of [[Amn]] north of the [[Cloud Peaks]]. Minsc tracked the gnolls to their hideout and sought out adventurers to aid in her rescue.\n\nEventually, Dynaheir reunited with Minsc, and along with [[Abdel Adrian]], [[Imoen]], [[Khalid]], and [[Jaheira]] stood against the [[Iron Throne]] and [[Sarevok Anchev]]. With the crisis over, Dynaheir and Minsc settled in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] for a little while. At first, she did not like it as it was too crowded, too dirty, too smelly, but one day Dynaheir discovered [[Sorcerous Sundries]] – a magic shop of wonders, filled with [[spell]]s and mages from across [[Toril]]. The wychlaran fell in love with the establishment and dragged Minsc there daily. The berserker complained but secretly loved seeing Dynaheir's happy smile. \n\nDynaheir was among the individuals that came to the rescue of [[Gorion's Ward]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, following his imprisonment within the dungeons of the [[Flaming Fist]] headquarters in [[Baldur's Gate]]. She was accompanied by Minsc and Boo of course, along with the [[Harpers]] [[Khalid]] and [[Jaheira]], and the young [[mage]] [[Imoen]]. Almost immediately the group was ambushed and imprisoned by the disfigured wizard, [[Jon Irenicus]]. While the exact manner is unknown, Dynaheir died in the dungeons beneath the city of [[Athkatla]]."
