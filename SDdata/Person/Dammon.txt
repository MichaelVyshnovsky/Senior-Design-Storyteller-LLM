'''Dammon''' was a [[tiefling]] blacksmith from [[Elturel]] that was forced to live as a refugee for some time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Dammon kept with him a number of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] weapons for sale, including ''[[arrow of Ilmater|arrows of Ilmater]]'', ''[[arrow of darkness|darkness]]'', and ''[[arrow of roaring thunder|roaring thunder]]'', along with the unique ''[[Blooded Greataxe]]''.

==History==
{{quote|'''When I found Carixim, he turned to me, with all those poor people's souls crammed into him, and he... he grinned at me. He said, "I been expecting you, boy."''|Overheard from the smith Dammon}}<br/>
Dammon described himself as being a "bread-and-butter [[Wikipedia:Tinsmith|tinsmith]]" prior to Elturel being pulled into the [[Nine Hells]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. During his time in [[Avernus]], he was identified as useful to [[Zariel]]'s forces as a smith and was put to work in the infernal forges under [[Carixim]]. There he learned how to forge [[Infernal iron|infernal metals]] and work with [[Infernal war machine|infernal machinery]].

Following [[the Descent]], Dammon and the other tieflings were exiled from their city. Dammon joined the exiles led by [[Zevlor]], serving as their smith and helping keep them armed during their journey west along the [[Risen Road]].
