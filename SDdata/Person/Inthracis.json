        "mainbody": "Inthracis was an ultroloth necromancer who lived in Corpsehaven in the Blood Rift.\nInthracis was a clone and kept clones of himself in reserve for his death.\nIn 1373 DR, Inthracis was approached by the god Vhaeraun, who demanded that Inthracis kill the three priestesses who were candidates to become the Yorthae (Chosen of Lolth) Quenthel Baenre, Danifae Yauntyrr, and Halisstra Melarn. As a reward, Vhaeraun promised Inthracis a higher position. Inthracis reached the Demonweb Pits at the Pass of the Soulreaver and there battled Quenthel, Danifae, Halisstra, Jeggred Baenre, and Pharaun Mizzrym. They defeated the regiment, however, and Inthracis was killed by Pharaun. His death was not permanent, however, as he had another clone body to revive in.\nInthraciss main rival was Kexxon the oinoloth, Archgeneral of the Blood Rift.\nOne of Inthraciss lieutenants was Nisviim, an arcanaloth enchanter. Inthracis had power over him because he knew his true name.\nInthracis had two canoloth pets named Carnage and Slaughter. Both of them are strongly loyal to him."
