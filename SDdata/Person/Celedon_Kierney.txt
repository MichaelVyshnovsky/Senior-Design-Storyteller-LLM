Celedon Kierney was a half-elf mage and scout active in the Bloodstone Lands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Celedon appeared as a charming rogue with more than a bit of elven blood in him. He stood at 5 feet, 9 inches tall (175 centimeters) and weighed . He was good-looking, and looked drastically younger than he actually was.
Celedon was excitable and mischievous but with a kind heart. He liked the thrill of a heist and would occasionally steal from evil folk just for the challenge, although he was quick to give away his spoils to those in need. He was also a bit of a procrastinator, and hesitated to make assumptions.
Celedon was known to possess a spellbook, a long sword +1  luck blade, a ring of protection +3, potion of fire breath, a oil of etherealness, a rod of alertness, and a mirror of mental prowess. He also had scrolls containing the spells contingency, forcecage, and volley.
