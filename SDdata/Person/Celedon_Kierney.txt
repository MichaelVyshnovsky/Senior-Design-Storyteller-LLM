'''Celedon Kierney''' was a [[half-elf]] [[mage]] and [[scout]] active in the [[Bloodstone Lands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Celedon appeared as a charming rogue with more than a bit of [[elf|elven]] blood in him. He stood at 5 feet, 9 inches tall (175 centimeters) and weighed {{SI|140|pounds|k|long=yes}}. He was good-looking, and looked drastically younger than he actually was.

==Personality==
Celedon was excitable and mischievous but with a kind heart. He liked the thrill of a heist and would occasionally steal from [[evil]] folk just for the challenge, although he was quick to give away his spoils to those in need. He was also a bit of a procrastinator, and hesitated to make assumptions.

==Possessions==
Celedon was known to possess a [[spellbook]], a [[long sword]] ''+1''  ''[[luck blade]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +3'', ''[[potion of fire breath]]'', a ''[[oil of etherealness]]'', a ''[[rod of alertness]]'', and a ''[[mirror of mental prowess]]''. He also had [[scroll]]s containing the spells ''[[contingency]]'', ''[[forcecage]]'', and ''[[volley]]''.

==Activities==
Celedon was the leader of the scouting network [[Spysong]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

==Relationships==
The bard [[Riordan Parnell]] was his cousin.

==History==
Celedon, along with his cousin Rioardan, would scout throughout the [[Galena Mountains]], and discovered locations like the [[Cave of the Whispering Wind]]. The two of them were among the strangers brought together by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] to respond to the requests for aid coming from [[Bloodstone Village]] following the [[Vaasan War]], and Celedon would go on to serve as both a commander and the Chief Scout in the army of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]] in the [[Bloodstone Wars]]. Celedon's actions were directly responsible for the end of that war, and for the permeant defeat of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], when he stole the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]'' and brought it to the [[Seven Heavens]] for destruction. 

Following the liberation of Damara from the Witch-King in [[1359 DR]], Celedon was knighted for his efforts. He helped to found the intelligence network Spysong, and was considered a hero across most of [[Damara]]. Once of his first major projects was to personally investigate a mysterious cloud that had settled over [[Suncatcher Mountain]]. 

A decade later, he participated in the battle between Gareth Dragonsbane, who at that time had become King of Damara, and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] for control of northern [[Vaasa]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, he played a central role in saving Gareth's life during the invasion of Damara by [[Sammaster]]'s forces during that year's [[Rage of Dragons]].
