        "mainbody": "Chen was a general of Shou Lung who earned the disfavor of the Emperor.\nGeneral Chen attempted to overthrow the Emperor of Shou Lung and seize the throne for himself during the 1330s DR. His coup nearly started a full-scale civil war between the northern and southern regions of Shou Lung. Chen was eventually captured but the Emperors soothsayers saved him from execution, saying his spirit would return for revenge if he was killed. The Emperor chose to send him to the Valley of Exiles as punishment."
