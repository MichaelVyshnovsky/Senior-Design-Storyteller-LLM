Naaman al-Rima was a halfling and the chief cook who served within the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Naaman directed the actions of dozens of other cooks. Preparing food within the Palace was quite the challenge. One day a feast could be need for hundreds of mamluks, while the next day a fine meal might be needed for the Grand Caliph himself.
Though she was extremely busy, Naaman personally inspected all of the Grand Caliphs meals.
