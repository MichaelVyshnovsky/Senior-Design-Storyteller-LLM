'''Naaman al-Rima''' was a [[halfling]] and the chief cook who served within the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|85}}

==Activities==
Naaman directed the actions of dozens of other cooks. Preparing food within the Palace was quite the challenge. One day a feast could be need for hundreds of [[mamluk]]s, while the next day a fine meal might be needed for the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] himself.

Though she was extremely busy, Naaman personally inspected all of the Grand Caliph's meals.
