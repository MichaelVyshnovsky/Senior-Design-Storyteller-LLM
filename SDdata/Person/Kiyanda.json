        "mainbody": "'''Kiyanda''' was a [[drow]] spy and a worshiper of [[Eilistraee]] who served [[Sabrae Tellendon]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], Sabrae Tellendon sent her trusted agent Kiyanda to investigate the recent drow activity in [[Undermountain]]. Kiyanda infiltrated the dark elves found in the ancient [[Garden of the Drow]] who served the High Priestess of [[Lolth]], [[Azurna]]. Kiyanda spent some time with the Lolth-worshiping drow and even befriended one of the young priestesses, [[Eskylla]]. She introduced the priestess of Lolth to a new and kind goddess, Eilistraee, eventually swaying her faith and helping her joining the [[Church of Eilistraee]]. Kiyanda was able to fool the sinister denizens of the dark but was eventually caught and captured. She missed her scheduled contact with Sabrae by a week, which alerted the High Priestess of the danger. Subsequently, Kiyanda was discovered in the prisons of the drow stronghold that served as the base for Azurna's forces and freed by an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]]."
