        "mainbody": "'''Iskander''' was a [[wizard]] belonging to the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons|Tyranny of Dragons.]] He served as second-in-command of [[Xonthal's Tower]],",
        "History": "Iskander was a wizard and a long-time member of the Cult. Being a [[dracolich]] traditionalist, he disliked the new direction of the Cult under [[Severin Silrajin|Severin]]'s leadership. Just before the events of the Tyranny of Dragons, Iskander was nominated as the second-in-command of the recently conquered [[Xonthal's Tower]]. The Tower was a bastion for traditionalists, and included other powerful Cult members such as [[Vargo Kent|Vargo the Faceless]] and [[Naergoth Bladelord]].\nIskander noticed a troubling pattern in which many promising young Cult members met their demise before reaching their full potential. Iskander grew suspicious that Severin was either encouraging advancement through assassination or the ordering the disposal of too-ambitious underlings. Believing that his position and traditionalist views made him a target, Iskander became increasingly paranoid.\nAfter experiencing a stomach affliction he believed to be an attempt to poison him, Iskander decided to betray the Cult. He sent a message to the [[Council of Waterdeep]], begging them to send agents to Xonthal's Tower to free him. In exchange, he would steal the ''[[Blue dragon mask]]'' and give it to the Council.\nA band of adventurers were sent by the Council to the Tower; however, they did not arrive in time. Iskander's fellow cultists had discovered his act of treason.\nUpon entering the Tower, the adventurers discovered Iskander was dead and the Mask was revealed as a forgery."
