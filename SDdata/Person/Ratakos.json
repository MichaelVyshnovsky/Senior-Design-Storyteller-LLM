        "mainbody": "Ratakos was an opportunistic human necromancer who wandered the Realms, ultimately coming to work for Lord Vorik Aris in 1369 DR.\nRatakos was a gaunt, thin man with pale skin and thinning black hair. He wore a dark green robe and had flashy rings on his fingers.\nRatakos was unpredictable and opportunistic, taking any situation to its fullest advantage. His sole passionate interest was the study and practice of necromancy, and was otherwise grim and stern.\nHis spellbook contained a wide array of arcane spells, with a special focus on necromantic spells. Some of his more interesting spells were Beltyns burning blood, disguise undead, Bloodstones spectral steed, death spell, lich touch, and teleport dead.\nHe wore a grey robe of the archmagi, a ring of undead command, a ring of regeneration, and an amulet versus undead. He also carried a +3 dagger, and useful items including potions of ghoul, skeleton, wight, and zombie control, and a scroll of protection from magic.\nRatakos traveled about, seeking opportunities to practice his craft with anyone who would care to indulge him. This drew him into many unlikely and dangerous situations, but he always knew when to disentangle himself.\nIn the , Ratakos was ambushed by the vampires Moria and Ryanna at the Journeys Rest inn. He used his powers over the undead to hold them at his mercy, and they quickly negotiated a much better deal. While he pretended to be a customer at the inn, he created undead that would harass travelers on the road nearby and cause them to stay the night at the inn. The vampires then feasted and killed the victims, supplying him with their fresh corpses.\nWhen the vampires plan eventually went awry, Ratakos stay uninvolved and unconcerned, and moved on to new ventures.\nHe later found himself working for Lord Vorik Aris at Wyvernwatch Castle, helping to manage his undead cohort. He had no loyalty to the man, only staying around as long as he could practice necromancy. He participated in the battle at Darkenshield and was not particularly impressed by the legion of murderous ghosts raised against Lord Aris, though he eventually fled when the tide turned against him."
