SosUmptu Baenre was a daughter of Yvonnel Baenre and a cleric of Lolth.
SosUmptu was about the height of Quenthel Baenre.
SosUmptu had a calculated and deliberate malice. She spent much of her time creating a jeweled spider golem to guard the chapel.
SosUmptu served as the keeper of the House Baenre chapel in Menzoberranzan for more than 200 years.
During Matron Mother Triel Baenres reign, SosUmptu served as Triels advisor when her main advisors, Gromph and Quenthel, were not available.
SosUmptu helped create the Fane of Quarvelsharess, a temple to Lolth where she served as a high priestess. She may have also been a mistress of Sorcere.
During Matron Mother Quenthel Baenres reign, SosUmptu originally served as First Priestess of House Baenre. In later years, she and Quenthels daughter Myrineyl competed for the title of First Priestess. In preparation for Myrineyl graduating from the academy in 1480 DR, SosUmptu began laying foundations to begin her own house separate from House Baenre.
In 1484 DR, SosUmptu briefly served as matron mother of the restored House DoUrden, She then became Mistress of Arach-Tinilith (replacing Quenthel), a position that was newly granted a seat on the Ruling Council.
During the Menzoberranzan civil war, her brother Jarlaxle negotiated the ending of the siege of House Baenre. She agreed that those who wanted to leave Menzoberranzan could, but would never be allowed to return. Those who remained at House Baenre were given mercy if they served her and Lolth once more.
SosUmptu was the daughter of Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre and thus the sister of Triel, Quenthel, BladenKerst, Vendes, Dantrag, Berginyon, and Gromph,  In 1484 DR, Quenthel was her sole surviving sister.
SosUmptu and BladenKerst had a poor relationship, leaving SosUmptu to seek refuge in the House Baenre chapel.
