'''Sos'Umptu Baenre''' was a daughter of [[Yvonnel Baenre]] and a [[cleric]] of [[Lolth]].

==Description==
Sos'Umptu was about the height of [[Quenthel Baenre]].

==Personality==
Sos'Umptu had a calculated and deliberate malice. She spent much of her time creating a jeweled spider [[golem]] to guard the chapel.

==History==
Sos'Umptu served as the keeper of the [[House Baenre]] chapel in [[Menzoberranzan]] for more than 200 years.

During [[Matron Mother]] [[Triel Baenre]]'s reign, Sos'Umptu served as Triel's advisor when her main advisors, Gromph and Quenthel, were not available.

Sos'Umptu helped create the [[Fane of Quarvelsharess]], a temple to [[Lolth]] where she served as a high priestess. She may have also been a mistress of [[Sorcere]].

During [[Matron Mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s reign, Sos'Umptu originally served as First Priestess of House Baenre. In later years, she and Quenthel's daughter [[Myrineyl Baenre|Myrineyl]] competed for the title of First Priestess. In preparation for Myrineyl graduating from the academy in [[1480 DR]], Sos'Umptu began laying foundations to begin her own house separate from House Baenre.

In [[1484 DR]], Sos'Umptu briefly served as matron mother of the restored [[House Do'Urden]], She then became Mistress of [[Arach-Tinilith]] (replacing Quenthel), a position that was newly granted a seat on the Ruling Council.

During the Menzoberranzan civil war, her brother [[Jarlaxle]] negotiated the ending of the siege of [[House Baenre]]. She agreed that those who wanted to leave Menzoberranzan could, but would never be allowed to return. Those who remained at House Baenre were given mercy if they served her and Lolth once more.<ref>

==Relationships==
Sos'Umptu was the daughter of [[Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] and thus the sister of [[Triel Baenre|Triel]], [[Quenthel Baenre|Quenthel]], [[Bladen'Kerst Baenre|Bladen'Kerst]], [[Vendes Baenre|Vendes]], [[Dantrag Baenre|Dantrag]], [[Berg'inyon Baenre|Berg'inyon]], and [[Gromph Baenre|Gromph]],  In [[1484 DR]], Quenthel was her sole surviving sister.

Sos'Umptu and Bladen'Kerst had a poor relationship, leaving Sos'Umptu to seek refuge in the House Baenre chapel.
