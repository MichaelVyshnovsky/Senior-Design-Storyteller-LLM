        "mainbody": "'''Xanos Messarmos''' was a [[half-orc]] [[sorcerer]] and [[barbarian]] from [[Chessenta]] and a former student of [[Drogan Droganson]] at [[Hilltop]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was a large half-orc man with black hair and mustache.",
        "Personality": "Xanos was not of greater-than-average intelligence among such races as [[human]]s, and occasionally stumbled intellectually in his arrogance, but he had studied and learnt from history and had grand and not very naive plans for improving himself before becoming a great leader. He was adamant of his future and destiny to one day hold great power and would have gone to extremes to get this. It also made him a very determined and ambitious worker. Xanos was eager to prove a point wherever possible, as well as having a sharp and sometimes offensive sense of humor, especially towards his fellow apprentices.",
        "Possessions": "His main weapons were [[dagger]]s.\n\nDrogan's apprentices all possessed a ring that allowed them to [[teleport]] themselves to Drogan's location at the cost of focus crystals.",
        "Relationships": "He was deeply competitive towards [[Dorna Trapspringer]] and often teased her. Similarly, Xanos mocked [[Mischa Waymeet]] when she failed to pass a test set by Drogan to rescue a [[goblin]] child and continued to look down on her abilities. Whilst Xanos wished to learn all he could, he did not care if Drogan approved of him or not, commenting that he merely was there to learn all he could from the [[dwarf]].",
        "History": "Xanos was born into an upper middle class family in [[Chessenta]]. He left home to carve himself a destiny and eventually enrolled in Drogan's school in [[Hilltop]] so he could learn to become an [[adventurer]] and great leader. Xanos was present during the [[kobold]] attack on the village and school in the {{YearlinkName|1372}} and helped locate the stolen artifacts."
