'''Shrymaun Beldaerth''' was a priest of [[Ilmater]] and the leader of the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] ''circa'' [[1265 DR]]. He held the title "Exalted Sufferer".

Around 1265 DR, the House of Holy Suffering had come into possession of the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', considered the holiest book of the [[Church of Ilmater]]. The [[Spontaer]], the senior [[Sage-Priest]] of the church, prayed to Ilmater for nearly a year and sacrificed himself to place powerful magical protections on the ''Tome''. Although the Spontaer had explicitly requested that the ''Tome of Torment'' be delivered to the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] in [[Calimshan]], the greatest temple of Ilmater, Shrymaun Beldaerth denied the Spontaer's wishes and refused to relinquish it.

Archsufferer [[Bloirt Waelarn]] of the Keltar house declared all those of the "degenerate" Mussum house "heretics" and called for them to be cast out and treated as mentally ill. The Mussum house recruited the [[Companions of the Noble Heart]] paladin order to their defense, and a holy war ensued over the artifact.
