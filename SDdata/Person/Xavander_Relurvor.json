        "mainbody": "'''Xavander Relurvor''', also known as '''Xavander the Great''', was the [[wizard]] who founded the [[realm of the Mount]] in the {{yearlinkName|1319}}.",
        "History": "Xavander discovered [[the Mount]] during the {{yearlinkName|1319}}, while looking for a place to hide with his family after his brother [[Ormalin Relurvor|Ormalin]] embezzled a large portion of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s treasury. After settling in, he used the volcano to melt the treasure, minting counterfeit [[Amn]]ian and [[Calishite]] coins with the resulting metals. Various family members faked their death and moved to the Mount, and after some internal strife Ormalin fell into a lava rift and Xavander established his kingdom.\n\nOnce his realm established, Xavander rented territory to [[Ravenaar]] individuals who could afford it. Those \"Tombs\" were officially sold as a place for their loved ones to rest, but were actually used as a hiding places where the \"Tomb Holders\" hid stolen goods, kidnapped rivals, or allies trying to lay low for a while. When Xavander was killed by a more powerful wizard, his son [[Tholander Relurvor|Tholander]] took over."
