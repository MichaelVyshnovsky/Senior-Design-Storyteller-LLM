        "mainbody": "'''Flo Hapgood''' was a relative of [[Grindo Biggs]], a [[Gondian]] foundry worker who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of Gondians was put to work at the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] in Baldur's Gate against their will, forced into slave labor by Lord [[Enver Gortash]] and his [[Cultists of Bane]]. One of the two motivations for the slaves' compliance was the fact that the Gondians' family members were abducted and held hostage within the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]]. Flo Hapgood was among the cult's hostages. She was not to see freedom however. During a role call for the hostages, Flo attempted to escape her prison, but was quickly cut down in the process."
