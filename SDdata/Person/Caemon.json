        "History": "During a pilgrimage, he came across the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s hunting lodge in the [[Greypeak Mountains]] and was captured by [[Talis Kasterel]]. However, he received good treatment, not like [[Craggnor]] and [[Miresella]]. Caemon suspected that this was because she wanted to convert him or to use him as a sacrifice to [[Tiamat]]."
