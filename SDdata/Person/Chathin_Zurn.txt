'''Chathin Zurn''' was the [[khazark]] of the [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]] of [[Thay]] within the city of [[Proskur]] in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As the highest-ranked [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] within the city, she had the full authority of Thay within the city. 

Chiathin was a champion of the strategy to establish enclaves within cities near the [[Inner Sea]], and voraciously debated this view against the standpoint that Thay should outright conquer other nations.

==Description==
===Appearance===
Chathin was a tall, thin woman who, like all [[Red Wizard]]s, had heavily-tattooed skin and kept her head bald.

===Personality===
An extremely capable wizard and proven leader, Chathin had a complex personality that often changed depending on her situation. She often spoke to others in a condescending manner, and came across as not being able to be trusted. In contrast, she could be gracious, when needed, and was quite protective of her subordinates at the enclave.

==Activities==
Khazark Zurn rarely left the [[Thayan embassy (Proskur)|embassy]] which housed her office, as well as those of her colleagues.

==Relationships==
[[Nular Rhyn]], a [[Thayan knight]] stationed at the enclave, was Chathin's personal bodyguard and rarely spent any significant time more than a few feet away from the khazark. [[Torisk Haut]]  was Chathin's immediate junior, and served as her spymaster, and [[Sopsek Zan]] was her personal secretary.

Chathin had a [[gazer]] [[familiar]], called [[Ypt]], that rarely left her side. The two shared an empathetic link.

==History==
Chiathin's parents were two [[wizard]]s who were brought together through an arranged marriage. She began her [[magic]]al studies early on in her youth and sought to further her studies before joining the ranks of the Red Wizards. Chiathin excelled quickly and found early success at a high-ranking position within the enclave, before starting her tenure as khazark.

==Possessions==
Among Chathin's possessions were a set of ''[[bracers of armor]] +3'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +2'', several magical [[wand]]s and a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]''. As khazark of a prosperous Thayan enclave, Chathin had access to a wide variety of magical items at a moment's notice.
