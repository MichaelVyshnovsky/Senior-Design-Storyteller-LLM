Chathin Zurn was the khazark of the enclave of Thay within the city of Proskur in central Faer√ªn during the late 14 century DR. As the highest-ranked Red Wizard within the city, she had the full authority of Thay within the city. 
Chiathin was a champion of the strategy to establish enclaves within cities near the Inner Sea, and voraciously debated this view against the standpoint that Thay should outright conquer other nations.
Chathin was a tall, thin woman who, like all Red Wizards, had heavily-tattooed skin and kept her head bald.
An extremely capable wizard and proven leader, Chathin had a complex personality that often changed depending on her situation. She often spoke to others in a condescending manner, and came across as not being able to be trusted. In contrast, she could be gracious, when needed, and was quite protective of her subordinates at the enclave.
Khazark Zurn rarely left the embassy which housed her office, as well as those of her colleagues.
Nular Rhyn, a Thayan knight stationed at the enclave, was Chathins personal bodyguard and rarely spent any significant time more than a few feet away from the khazark. Torisk Haut  was Chathins immediate junior, and served as her spymaster, and Sopsek Zan was her personal secretary.
Chathin had a gazer familiar, called Ypt, that rarely left her side. The two shared an empathetic link.
Chiathins parents were two wizards who were brought together through an arranged marriage. She began her magical studies early on in her youth and sought to further her studies before joining the ranks of the Red Wizards. Chiathin excelled quickly and found early success at a high-ranking position within the enclave, before starting her tenure as khazark.
Among Chathins possessions were a set of bracers of armor +3, a cloak of resistance +2, several magical wands and a necklace of fireballs. As khazark of a prosperous Thayan enclave, Chathin had access to a wide variety of magical items at a moments notice.
