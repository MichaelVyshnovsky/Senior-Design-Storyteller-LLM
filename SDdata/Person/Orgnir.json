Wandering the mountain slopes, he came across the Dragonbone Vale. Exhausted, Orgnir collapsed near the ruin where the Scaleblight Mythallar was buried under. As the giant was sleeping, the mythallars corruption seeped into his body, stealing the adventurers life and twisting his now undead form into a guardian bound to the artifact. With years, Orgnir the Lost became a guardian of the lands, guiding the dead dragons to their graves in the valley."
