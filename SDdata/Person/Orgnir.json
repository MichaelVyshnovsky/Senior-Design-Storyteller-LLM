        "History": "Orgnir's career as a giant adventurer came to an end when he got lost in the Sword Mountains sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR. Wandering the mountain slopes, he came across the Dragonbone Vale. Exhausted, Orgnir collapsed near the ruin where the ''[[Scaleblight Mythallar]]'' was buried under. As the giant was sleeping, the ''[[mythallar]]'s'' corruption seeped into his body, stealing the adventurer's life and twisting his now undead form into a guardian bound to the [[artifact]]. With years, Orgnir the Lost became a guardian of the lands, guiding the dead dragons to their graves in the valley."
