'''Merzan''' was one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]] in the fortress of [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He was a part of the team accompanying [[Sauk]] to look for [[Kheil]] and secure the ''[[Erael'len]]'' in the Northern [[Shalhoond]] in [[Tarsakh]] of {{yearlink|1374}}, conspiring to kill the [[Chereth|Old Man of the Mountain]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||4}} Merzan was tall and swarthy, with the build and complexion of a [[Thayan]]. He wore western clothes, and kept both his hair and beard well trimmed. To [[Berun]], he seemed like a stone-cold killer. He watched over Berun and [[Lewan]] for [[Sauk]] while on the way back to [[Sentinelspire (fortress)|Sentinelspire]]; after Sauk offered Berun a chance to help him hunt some [[yaqubi]] and he turned it down, Sauk decided [[Valmir]] should watch them instead, with Merzan joining Sauk's hunting party.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||8}}
