Skulner Wainwright was a human wainwright that lived in the town of Triboar, operating Wainwrights Wagons, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was renowned for his innovative wagon work all across the North, being by far the most famous wagonmaker in the region as of 1365 DR.
Skulner was kept fairly busy on a daily basis by the never-ending clamor for his wagons Whenever he could find time to himself though, Skulner whittled away the hours in his workshop designing and testing new ideas for wagons.
In the , Skulner was working on a new prototype design that he dubbed the "rolling cog". A particularly large wagon, he was designing it with the intent that it could double as a barge. This prototype would prove to be a success and later be employed on the Dessarin River. However, Skulner would find himself repeatedly struggling to improve upon the rolling cogs design, reconciling the need for it transport a sizable number of cattle whilst also remaining small enough to avoid the hazard of river-bend sandbanks.
By , Skulner was fairly wealthy from his wainwright exploits and was content with life. However, Skulner yearned to one day design and create a wagon that was capable of flight. He would not settle for dissecting the designs of either an Evermeet skyship or Halruaan skyship, nor would he accept the use of the strange magics employed in Nimbral. To this end he hoped to one day visit the island nation of Lantan and discuss designs with the innovative artificer-ranked priests of the Gondian clergy.
