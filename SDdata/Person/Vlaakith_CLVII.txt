Vlaakith CLVII, also known as the Lich Queen, was the ruler of the githyanki race.
Vlaakith CLVII was primarily jealous and paranoid, willing to eat the souls of those who reached a certain level of strength, regardless of the kind, to secure her position and bolster her own personal strength. The insane lich sought to ascend to the ranks of divinity.
Vlaakith CLVII was very knowledgeable in arcane, historic, planar, and religious matters. She was also a very capable alchemist. Like any other wizard, she could create magical scrolls, as well as rings and wondrous items. Her skill at the last exceeded mortal levels. The Lich Queen was trained in the usage of a silver sword.
She had the abilities of a fully developed githyanki and most of the basic lich abilities. She was also a powerful wizard who trained herself in the arts of necromancy and transmutation in particular. Her spellcasting could exceed normal limits and was specifically tuned to punch through her targets resistance against magic. Her ability to maintain spellcasting in adverse situations was tremendous as was her general spellcasting skill. She also had some skill at metamagic, namely to enhance effectiveness and duration. The former was normally used to enhance circle of death, enervation, horrid wilting, ray of enfeeblement, spell turning, time stop, and vampiric touch spells, while she used the latter to extend her dominate monster, eyebite, haste, heroism, and spectral hand spells.
Other spells she normally used included animate dead, contagion, detect thoughts, dimensional anchor, disguise self, disintegrate, dismissal, displacement, finger of death, foresight, gate, greater dispel magic, greater teleport, hold monster, lightning bolt, magic circle against good, magic jar, mirror image, slow, stoneskin, touch of idiocy, true seeing, wail of the banshee,  wall of force, waves of exhaustion, waves of fatigue, web, wish, and other more common and practical spells.
She was weak against harm that came from light.

Vlaakith CLVII owned a large number of powerful magic items. Among them were +8 bracers of armor, a +6 cloak of charisma, a +5 dancing vorpal silver sword, a +6 headband of intellect, a +4 ring of protection, a ring of wizardry IV, a robe of eyes, and scrolls of prismatic sphere, protection from spells, shapechange, and time stop. Two artifacts, which she always carried with herself, were the crown of corruption and the scepter of Ephelomon.
The last queen of the githyanki, Vlaakith CLVII, died after ascending the throne without giving birth to an heir, but returned as a lich, thus remaining the ruler of the githyanki for over a thousand years. Her home, Castle Susurrus, was located in the Queens District of the githyanki capital city, Tunarath, which was built on the corpse of a deceased power known only as "The One in the Void".
The basis of the Vlaakith lines claim on power was a supposed blood relationship with Gith.
One of the queens jobs was to decide whether every visitor to Tunarath should be granted a visa or not. However, Vlaakith CLVII delegated this duty of hers to lesser generals.
Vlaakith CLVII had a number of red dragons under her service. These red dragons feared her so much that they would continue to serve her even if the scepter of Ephelomon would be destroyed.
Vlaakith was the name of many rulers of the githyanki race after the disappearance of Gith, the rebel leader that united them against the illithids. The original holder, Vlaakith I helped seal the pact between the red dragons and the githyanki. All subsequent queens of the githyanki were named after her.
Vlaakith CLVII stood out among the Vlaakiths for becoming a lich. Her undying reign and her success at getting rid of those who could challenge her were why she managed to retain her throne for longer than any other Vlaakith.
After centuries of undeath, she grew mad. She came up with an idea to become a deity and started to install a priest caste in githyanki society. She also sent loyal lieutenants to quell any unrest that might arise. These were done to gradually prepare for her ascension and encourage the githyanki to worship her as a deity. An inquisitor caste to hunt down people whom she wanted gone also existed. However, many githyanki viewed her as a mad tyrant who would cause their peoples destruction or enslavement at her hands even before she reached her goal.
In the late 15th century DR, Vlaakith dispatched a force of githyanki warriors under the leadership of Inquisitor Wwargaz to Toril in search of the Astral Prism, an artefact of immense power that had been stolen by worshippers of Shar.
