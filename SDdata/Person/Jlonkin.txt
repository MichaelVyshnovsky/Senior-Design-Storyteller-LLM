Jlonkin the Bowyer was one of the few inhabitants of Fallenfalcon, a thorp along the Bowshot road in the wild realm of Owlhold in the Border Kingdoms.
By the late 14 century DR, Jlonkin and his family lived in one of the two cottages close to the main pavilion in Fallenfalcon. The bowyer and his family provided travelers who stayed at the camping pavilion with fresh bread and soup, offering bigger meals upon request ahead of time.
