'''Erned Stoutblade''' was a member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], having heard that the [[Iceshield]] [[orc]]s had attacked many farms in the [[Dessarin Valley]], he decided to go to the [[Dellmon]] farm to help [[Kerbin Dellmon]] to fight them off. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm.
