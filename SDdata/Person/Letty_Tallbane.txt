Letty Tallbane was a halfling monk in Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
Letty had pixie-cut orange hair and wore a light fabric and leather outfit. She carried a simple staff as her weapon.
Letty camped at the ruins of Beckside Castle on the High Road around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar and Shadovar invasion of Wheloon. She faced choice paralysis while looking at Breagar Copperveins selection of goods, finding the torches particularly compelling.
