Garstrom had pale skin and light blond hair pulled and tied back. He carried a [[crossbow]] as a matter of course.

}}
Around the time of the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], Garstrom was hired by the [[Harpers]] [[Kirinel Zay]] and [[Tarim Inavule]] to aid their ad-hoc [[adventurer]] agents. He used his exceptional skill in tracking to locate the secretive [[Thorngap]] druidic refuge, leading the Harpers to [[Thorn Hollow]] and then the [[Druid's Deep]], allowing them to neutralize the rogue druid [[Halsaime]]. Despite his contributions, he was not a Harper, just paid very well for his time.
