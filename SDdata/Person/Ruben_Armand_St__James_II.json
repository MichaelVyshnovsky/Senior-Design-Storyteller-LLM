        "Personality": "Ruben was an archetypal paladin in manner, being brave, dutiful, and vigilant. He would not hesitate to charge into danger while shouting his devotion to Tyr.",
        "Possessions": "He had a ''[[holy avenger]] [[bastard sword]]'' that he wielded with a magical [[shield]], and wore a suit of [[field plate]], a ''[[ring of spell turning]]'', and a ''[[talisman of know alignment]]''. He also had a [[pegasus]] mount.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]] he was a guest at a royal party at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]] alongside his dour companion [[Norrin Blackgrove]], when their host Lord [[Partic Thistle]] appeared to be mysteriously murdered. As an upstanding paladin of Tyr, Ruben was considered above suspicion during the investigation."
