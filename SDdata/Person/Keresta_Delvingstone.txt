'''Keresta Delvingstone''' was the leading [[cleric]] of [[Shar]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Once Keresta was an outlaw on the streets of [[Waterdeep]]. In search of money, she decided to became an adventurer and went into Undermontain but there Keresta was made a [[vampire spawn]] by a [[vampire lord]]. Her salvation came when [[Vanrak Moonstar]] destroyed her vampire master and reclaimed the lair for Shar. Keresta quickly converted to the worship of the Goddess of the Night and became a lieutenant under Vanrak. When at last Vanrak redeemed himself, she went on to be the main leader of the [[Dark Army of the Night]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Keresta was plotting an attack on the [[Spires of the Morning]] or the [[House of the Moon]].

==Activities==
Keresta was planning a great attack against a major temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in the city in order to avenge Vanrak.

==Personality==
Keresta was a true zealot of Shar and really wanted to avenge the loss of Vanrak.

==Relationship==
Under her guidance, most of the cultists were vampire spawns under her command. She had enthralled the adventurer [[Portia Dzuth]]. Usually Keresta had at her side her [[yeti]] bodyguard [[Thagor]]. [[Artor Morlin]] greatly desired her death.
