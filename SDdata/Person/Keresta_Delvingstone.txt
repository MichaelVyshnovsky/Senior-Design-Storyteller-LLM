Keresta Delvingstone was the leading cleric of Shar in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Once Keresta was an outlaw on the streets of Waterdeep. In search of money, she decided to became an adventurer and went into Undermontain but there Keresta was made a vampire spawn by a vampire lord. Her salvation came when Vanrak Moonstar destroyed her vampire master and reclaimed the lair for Shar. Keresta quickly converted to the worship of the Goddess of the Night and became a lieutenant under Vanrak. When at last Vanrak redeemed himself, she went on to be the main leader of the Dark Army of the Night.
In 1492 DR, Keresta was plotting an attack on the Spires of the Morning or the House of the Moon.
Keresta was planning a great attack against a major temple to Sel√ªne in the city in order to avenge Vanrak.
Keresta was a true zealot of Shar and really wanted to avenge the loss of Vanrak.
Under her guidance, most of the cultists were vampire spawns under her command. She had enthralled the adventurer Portia Dzuth. Usually Keresta had at her side her yeti bodyguard Thagor. Artor Morlin greatly desired her death.
