'''PJ Stubbs''' was sailor and a friend of [[Bosun Gannet]] of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] tavern in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], PJ Stubbs sailed to the nation of [[Calimshan]], south of Baldur's Gate. There, he visited a popular local watering hole â€“ [[The Copper Tap]], the establishment that gave him the worst night of his life, worse than an incident with a [[bear]] in [[Chult]]. The Copper Tap was known for its own award-winning brews, yet when PJ tried one, he described the taste as "flowers having a wank on his tongue." Even after drinking ten pints of [[ale]] did not clear the taste out. The sailor told of the misadventure in a letter addressed to Bosun Gannet and asked the barkeep to prepare a couple of [[barrel]]s of drinks for PJ's next visit that was sure to wash the flower taste out at last.
