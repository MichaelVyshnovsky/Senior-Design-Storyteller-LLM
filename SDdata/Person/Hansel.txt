'''Hansel''' was a performing [[bear]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Hansel danced while his friend, [[Elestar]], played the accordian.

==Relationships==
Hansel seemd fully capable of understanding Elestar's verbal commands. This was in part because Elestar was a skilled [[ranger]], but also because Hansel was actually a [[werebear]].
