Hansel was a performing bear inhabiting Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Hansel danced while his friend, Elestar, played the accordian.
Hansel seemd fully capable of understanding Elestars verbal commands. This was in part because Elestar was a skilled ranger, but also because Hansel was actually a werebear.
