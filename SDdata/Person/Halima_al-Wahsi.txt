Caliph '''Halima al-Wahsi''' was the ruler of [[Ajayib]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] region of [[west Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} 

==Description==
Halima was tall and possessed a face said to be more perfect than a bright moon, eyes darker than a deep well, and a smile that could set fabric ablaze. She wore her thick hair down to the small of her back. Her hair was worn loose at court, but tied into a tight coil during combat.

==Personality==
Halima's mental acuity was just as impressive as her beauty.

==Activities==
Though Halima was a skilled [[askara]] and yearned for the thrill of battle, she took her duties at court seriously.
