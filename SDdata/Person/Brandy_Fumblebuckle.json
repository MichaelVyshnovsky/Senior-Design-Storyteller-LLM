        "mainbody": "'''Brandy Fumblebuckle''' was an [[adventurer]] in [[Cormyr]] with the [[Grand Fist]] company in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Brandy was a helpful, kind and pleasant person, but was also rather useless and incompetent in most regards.",
        "History": "In {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Brandy and [[Jacer Wind-dancer]] attended a party at [[Thistleflame Keep]], held by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] for King [[Azoun IV]]'s birthday. They were interviewed as suspects after Lord Thistle appeared to be murdered at the party, but any suspicions that they committed a complex and lethal plot were obviated by their bumbling and incompetent natures."
