Andros Calaudra was the master of House Calaudra in Melvaunt in 1372 DR.
In 1372 DR, Andross daughter Kara Calaudra went on adventures with some friends and disappeared. Lord Woarsten Nanther hired an adventuring party to find the boys.
Andros supported the relationship between Kara and Elaint Marsk but had warned his daughter to not fully trust full-blooded humans. (He himself was a half-elf.) Like all the Calaudras, he was a wizard.
