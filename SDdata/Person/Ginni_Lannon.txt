Ginni Lannon was Pitney Lannons wife and a fellow soldier. They had four children â€“ Pitney Junior, Kiri, Kyl, and Kaye Lannon.
In the , soon after, the Mere of Dead Men was briefly consumed by a short but deadly conflict known as the Second War of the Shadow. As the village was being rebuild and recovered, the towns mage, Tarmas, disappeared. Ginni and Pitney Lannon volunteered to follow the wizards tracks and attempt the rescue. The Lannons discovered Tarmas captured by lizardfolk within the Dragon Caves south of West Harbor. They quickly returned the man back to the village. However, unbeknownst to them, Tarmas they retrieved was a magically disguised black dragon. Then the deception was revealed, Pitney joined the soldiers in defending the village against Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor, who wanted to take over the village and its Harvest Mead brewery. It was up to adventurers to aid the soldiers or the dragons.
