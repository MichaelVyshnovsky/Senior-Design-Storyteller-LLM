        "Personality": "Sarkalla, in a word, was mad. Her main objective was to create a truly sentient [[ooze]] in order to use it as a \"perfect assassin\". She was greatly proud of her Ooze Master, and considered it her crowning achievement.",
        "History": "Sarkalla was a [[transmuter]] assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault located under [[Thaymount]]. She was tasked with the mission of creating a perfect assassin and she decided that the best way was to create a sentient ooze. In time Sarkalla had success only in fusing [[human]]s and oozes, creating the [[Ooze Master]]. \n\nHeroes from [[Daggerford]] fought with her [[wight]] minions, but after they destroyed the wights Sarkalla called a truce. She proposed that, if the heroes served as bodyguards and assistants for the Ooze Master, then she would give them information about the dungeon."
