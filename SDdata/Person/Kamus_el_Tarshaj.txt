'''Kamus yn Tasyn el Tarshaj''' was one of the many [[Syl-pasha|pashas]] of [[Calimport]] and rulers of [[Calimshan]] during its [[Fifth Age of Calimshan|Fifth Age]].<ref name=EotSS-pp20-21><ref name=EotSS-p42><ref name=TGHotR-p57>

Kamus el Tarshaj was remembered in history for his gift of the territory later known as [[Ankaram]] to King [[Silvam Ithal]] of [[Tethyr]] for his assistance in the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]]. This occurred in the {{YearlinkName|-50}}.<ref name=EotSS-p42/><ref name=TGHotR-p57/> On the surface, it appeared an act of generosity, but in reality, the pasha hoped to nullify rumors that Tethyr was planning to conquer all of Calimshan during one of its weakest hours.<ref name=EotSS-pp20-21 />
