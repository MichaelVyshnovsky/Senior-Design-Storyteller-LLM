Gerringothe Thorm was a toll collector who lived in the town of Reithwin in the shadow-cursed lands during the 15 century DR.
Like everyone else in Reithwin, she was affected by the shadow curse that plagued the land. It transformed her into an undead creature and warped her mind, causing her to become single-mindedly obsessed with gold.
In her shadow-cursed undead form, the surface of Gerringothes entire body and clothing was transformed into a carapace of solid gold, granting her the appearance of an animated golden statue of a portly woman. Her face was mask-like and did not move when she spoke. Underneath this golden shell was an emaciated humanoid form with horns and glowing red eyes.
In life, Gerringothe worked as a toll collector in Reithwin, where her family had lived for generations. At some point, she became barred from the Waning Moon Distillery by her relative Thisobald Thorm after an undisclosed incident.
After Ketheric unleashed the shadow curse on Reithwin and the surrounding lands, Gerringothe was transformed into an undead creature, and haunted the tollhouse where she once worked.
