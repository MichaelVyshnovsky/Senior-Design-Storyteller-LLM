'''Gillian Cantilar''' was the [[half-elven]] [[ranger]] who dwelt on the top of the hill that later became the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]] and was the town's namesake.

==Description==
Gillian Cantilar was said to be a creature of great beauty.

==History==
Long before 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Gillian lived in a lone house atop the wooded mound at the northern edge of the area that eventually became known as Gillian's Hill. The ranger was considered a hero and defender by merchants who traveled along the [[Trade Way]]. Gillian was one of the very few who set out to spy on local bandits, poachers, and make sure caravans remained unspoiled by the many dangers of the road.

Eventually, the area of the ranger's razed home was taken by the elevated fire cairn, used to warn [[Daggerford]] of encroaching enemy armies of [[Dragonspear Castle]] and [[Serpent Hills]]. However, the makeshift tower was often used as a flophouse for various unsavory elements. In [[1372 DR]], a group known as the [[Gillian's Hill Gang]] was occupying the spot while targeting passing traders and merchants.
