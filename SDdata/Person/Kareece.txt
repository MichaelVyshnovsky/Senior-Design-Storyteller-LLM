==History==
In approximately {{yearlink|1358}},The date of the memories in chapter 3 is not given in the Realmslore chapter. However, as Laeral and Khelben moved in together in 1357, and the loss of magic to which many of the events refer in the book is on 1358, it is assumed that the event referred to in the memory is the Time of Troubles, in 1358. More information may further narrow or refute this date. she burst in on Khelben and Laeral while they were taking a break from cutting hair to "feel the Weave". She apologized for the intrusion.
