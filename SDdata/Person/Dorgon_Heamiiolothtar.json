        "mainbody": "'''Dorgon \"Stonecloak\" Haemiiolothtar''' was the [[magister]] of [[Mystra]] during the 2{{nd}} and 3{{rd}} centuries [[DR]], having enjoyed the longest tenure since the mortal [[Azuth]]. He served this post from the [[177 DR|Year of the Troublesome Vixen, 177 DR]] to the [[241 DR|Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR]].",
        "Description": "Dorgon was kind man with a peaceful disposition who, when necessary, was capable of acts of ruthlessness and unforgiving retaliation.",
        "History": "Dorgon ascended as Magister following the death of his friend and former-master [[Malanthus Stormstaern]], who had died after being struck by a \"falling star\" that, may or may not, have been a malfunctioning [[spelljammer]].\n\nIn the [[229 DR|Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR]], Dorgon defended himself from a group of [[magelord]]s who sought to challenge his authority.\n\nWhen the old wizard was too weak to continue his service to the Goddess of Magic, he sought out the most unscrupulous mage from among his contemporaries, [[Sirdan Aulauger]] of [[Shussel]] and assaulted him. Both men perished in the ensuing [[spell]]-battle.\n\nThe office of magister was then offered by Azuth to [[Faerndel]] of [[Mourktar]], who refused the Lord of Spells. [[Nelorth Broamshoulder]] accepted the tile thereafter, and succeeded Dorgon as the personal champion of Mystra."
