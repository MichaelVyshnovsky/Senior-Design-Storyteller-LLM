        "Description": "Mavus was a [[tiefling]] child with ash-gray skin, stubby short horns, and flaming orange eyes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the famed [[Circus of the Last Days]] returned to the city of Baldur's Gate. [[Izzy]] and her friend [[Mavus]] were curious about the wondrous creatures that the circus brought to Rivington. Izzy and Mavus were trying to peep inside and vault over the circus walls to get inside, despite being forbidden from going inside by Mavus' father. The fielding was the sheepish one among the kinds and was afraid of the circus' [[djinni]] but really yearned to see the famed [[Dribbles]] the clown, much beloved by the kids of Baldur's Gate. Unlike Izzy, Mavus was worried about trespassing. He could not say the word properly and hoped that kids could not get in trouble over it."
