Amaerathae Hawkyns was a member of the Hawkyns merchant family and a daughter of Torgrym Hawkyns who resided in Athkatla in the late 14 century DR.
Like her sisters Nithimra and Galonquil, Amaerathae was a tall and good-looking woman.
Amaerathae was a pleasant and warm individual who cared little about Amnian formalities and etiquette.
Raised in wealth, among art, revelry, and festivities, Amaerathae, like all members of her family, was a talented singer and dancer. She possessed high tolerance for alcohol and could remain clear-minded throughout all the many nights of Hawkyns family revelries in the clans sprawling Hallowturrets House mansion.
By the late 14 century DR, Amaerathae and her two sisters were the only surviving children of plump and pleasant Torgrym Hawkyns. Her brothers and mother, Torgryms wife, had perished many years prior.
