Anusha Marhana was the spoiled daughter of the Marhana merchant family.  
In 1396 DR, she discovered that she had an uncanny ability to create an astral projection of herself when sleeping (it likely being a form of spellscar). Using her abilities, she stowed away on Captain Thosters Green Siren. Later she was lost within the dreams of the Eldest in her dream form, where she met Yeva.
Her mother and father were both killed in Sembia. She was the younger half-sister of Behroun Marhana.
