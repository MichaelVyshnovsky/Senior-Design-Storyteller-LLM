Unfortunately, the group of students working under him were slain by a member of their group named Zhardol, who either went mad or became possessed by some entity.\nDarney worked with Vandra and the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover old work orders from dwarven miners that were killed and raised as ashen zombies following the eruption of Mount Hotenow nearly 30 years prior. He used the documents along with some explosives to dislodge debris that clogged geothermal vents and help ease the pressure that was once again building up inside the volcanic mountain. By following the paths of the vents, Darney helped the adventurer discover the Shadowfire Cavern, along with the magma elemental being controlled by the crazed fire giant Gommoth."
