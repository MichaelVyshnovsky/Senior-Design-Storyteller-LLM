        "History": "After the [[1264 DR|Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR]], [[Beromchess Ilthyn]], a priestess of [[Ilmater]], brought the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the faith—to the House of Holy Suffering. There, the Spontaer studied the tome.\n\nThe Spontaer prayed to Ilmater for nearly a year, and received visions of powerful magical protections that would render the ''Tome'' usable only by priests of Ilmater, and not just those willing to suffer its barbs, and thereby make it less desirable to thieves. However, these protections would come at the cost of his life. The Spontaer explicitly requested that the ''Tome of Torment'' be delivered to the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] in [[Calimshan]], the greatest temple of Ilmater, before he worked the magic on the ''Tome'' and sacrificed his own life.\n\nHowever, Exalted Sufferer [[Shrymaun Beldaerth]], leader of the House of Holy Suffering, denied the Spontaer's wishes and refused to yield the ''Tome'' up to the House of the Broken God, triggering a holy war over the artifact.\n\nThe Spontaer's successor as official church historian adopted the title [[Keeper of the Old Faith]].",
