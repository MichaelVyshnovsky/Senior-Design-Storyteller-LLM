'''Iriskree''' was an old, reclusive [[half-elf]] [[sorceress]] of considerable power from the [[Starmantle]] area as of the mid-late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the first teacher for the [[Magister]] ''[[Ohland Grethgar]]''.

==History==
She died at some point prior to the {{yearlinkName|1280}}, of a [[winter fever]]; before that point, she'd written to her last kinswoman that the young Ohland had a spark for the art that was brighter than most.
