==Activities==
Huedyn was part of a group of druids under Great Druid [[Antola Pilark]] who were allied with House [[Kendrick]]'s forces against the dark [[fey]] infesting the Dernall Forest. Huedryn was actually a planted spy for the dark fey who was trying to expose the druids and forces of Callidyrr to attack.
