Thoadrin was an agent of the Cult of the Dragon in the mid-14 century DR.
He wanted to live a long life, and disliked taxes.
Thoadrin was known to wield crossbows.
He was known to the Zhentarim. He had extensive contacts in Scornubel, being acquainted with Marlel for example.
He was quite wealthy.
In late 1357, Thoadrin hired Marlel in Scornubel to capture Shandril Shessair. He arranged for the payment to come down in a chest with five hundred top grade Calishite rubies. He restocked there, introducing himself as the Dragonbone fool on a horse. After that, he hurried his forces to set an ambush along the way to Haelhollow. The ambush was set along the Trade Way.
He was injured with spellfire in that battle, and fled with Laranthan, another Cult warrior, meaning to lay low in Waterdeep until their superiors had moved on from the matter.
