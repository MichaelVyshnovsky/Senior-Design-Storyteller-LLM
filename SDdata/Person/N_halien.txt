'''N'halien''' was an early knight of [[Neverwinter]] and the seventh of the Nine knights who served Lord [[Halueth Never]]. They were the basis for the [[Neverwinter Nine]].

==History==
In a battle against the armies of [[Illusk]], N'halien saved Halueth from an [[arrow]], but caught it in his chest and died instead. A statue of N'halien and his sword later stood guard in Halueth's tomb.
