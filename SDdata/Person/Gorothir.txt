'''Gorothir''' the ''Dark Prophet of the Night'' was a powerful high [[priest]] of [[Shar]] during the time of the [[Netheril|Netherese empire]].{{Cite web enhancement/Vanrakdoom|23-24}}

==Description==
Gorothir was said to be darkly handsome, and sired countless children over his centuries-long life.

==Personality==
Gorothir was a cunning and energetically evil man, feared even by his fellow faithful. He liked to indulge in sensual excesses and orgies of violence, and was given seemingly endless power by his goddess. Gorothir ruled his church and the lands it controlled like a mad tyrant.

==Abilities==
The ''Dark Prophet'' was said to be able to turn into a ''man-[[stag]]'' twice as tall as a man. He was also said to be able to twist spells cast against him, causing their magical powers to go haywire.

==Possessions==
Gorothir possessed two objects which were considered as sacred [[relic]] by the followers of the Dark Lady:
;[[Gorothir's Girdle]]
: A magical [[corset]] of great power and one of the [[church of Shar]]'s [[holy book]]s.

;The [[Shadowstaff of Gorothir]]
: A magical [[staff]] capable of manipulating shadow magic, summoning various creatures and casting ''[[shadow bolt]]s''.

==Relationships==
Gorothir's gave his name to his descendants, which were known as the [[Goroth]] family. One of those descendants, [[Jurguth Goroth]], was involved in his ancestor's death and snatched up [[Gorothir's Girdle]] afterwards.

==History==
Gorothir was a powerful priest of Shar, active around the [[Fall of Netheril]]. Around the {{YearlinkName|-310}}, he came into possession of a divine relic of the Mistress of the Night&mdash;the eponymous [[Gorothir's Girdle|girdle]]. The origin of the Girdle was unclear: some believed that the powerful priest created it, whereas others believed it was gifted to her high priest by the Dark Lady herself.

Due to his tremendous power and tyrannical nature, Gorothir was feared as much as he was hated. During the {{YearlinkName|446}} his grandchilden allied with several of his enemies, from disgruntled mages to rulers whose thrones were usurped. The motley alliance ambushed him while he was raiding a place of power sacred to [[Selûne]], during an event which would later be known as the [[Night of Dark Fire]]. They managed to kill him in a massive conflagration of magic which killed most of them as well. After this victory an [[archmage]] of Selûne shattered the [[Shadowstaff of Gorothir|staff]] of the high priest, losing his life in the process. As for his [[Gorothir's Girdle|belt]], it was salvaged by one of his descendants and played a major part in the history of the [[Church of Shar]] afterwards.

During the {{YearlinkName|1136}}, the whispers of the Dark Goddess led Lord [[Vanrak Moonstar]] to find the remains of Gorothir and of his staff. The Dark Ranger built a crypt to store those blessed relics in his base of [[Vanrakdoom]], deep in [[Undermountain]]. The relics were kept in a sarcophagus resting on the desecrated ''[[Plinth Stone of the Moonmaiden]]''. To reward this act of great devotion, Shar restored the Shadowstaff to its former power and sent a couple [[Angel of decay|angels of decay]] to watch over the relics.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that Gorothir felled an empire with only a lie and a secret.
