'''Vairshekellabex''' was a [[gray dragon]] who lived on an [[earthmote]] above Old Man's Head mountain in the [[Akanapeaks]].  He was allied with [[Tchazzar]] and with the help of [[Tiamat|Tiamat's]] clergy, he made it appear that [[dragonborn]] were attacking villages and caravans in [[Akanûl]].  This was part of Tchazzar's plot to convince Akanûl to join him in an invasion of [[Tymanther]].  [[Aoth Fezim]] led an expedition composed of members of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] and [[genasi]] to the Akanapeaks where they attacked and killed Vairshekellabex.
