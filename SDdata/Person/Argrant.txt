Argrant was a sage of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
In the , alongside Loagranboydar, Orkrash, Wyshbryn, and Garendor, Argrant had been given the task of investigating the secret records of noble family trees. The War Wizard Glathra Barcantle sought to make use of their knowledge to find out who had sent a blueflame ghost against the Crown. However, when Glathra and Vainrence went to meet with them, they found them to have been reduced to piles of ash, with magic still hanging about their remains.
