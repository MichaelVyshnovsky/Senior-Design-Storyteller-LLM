Adrian Martikov was a vintner who lived and worked at his familys vineyard, the Wizard of Wines, in the domain of Barovia.
He was a gracious and generous man who did all he could to honor the Martikov family name. Unlike so many others in Barovia, he kept an optimistic and positive outlook on things, even during dire circumstances.
Adrian worked hard to help his familys business, making deliveries by cart despite the obscuring fog and dangers found along the road.
Adrian was a part of the Martikov family, that also included his father Davian.
Some time circa the 1480s DR of the Faer√ªnian calendar, Adrian was transporting a cart full of wine casks when he was assaulted by a pack of ghouls. Speeding away from the undead monsters, Adrians speeding cart attracted the attention of the Torillian adventurers known as the Heroes of Baldurs Gate and he was saved from a rather grim death.
In a gesture of gratitude, he offered the adventurers lodging for the night, in the vineyards stables, along with a free bottle of Red Dragon Crush.
