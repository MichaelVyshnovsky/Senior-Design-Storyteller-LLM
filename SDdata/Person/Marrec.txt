'''Marrec''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Lurue]] in {{yearlink|1373}}.Though Marrec is consistently referred to as a man in the text, his aunts claim that his father is not of their kind; medusae mating with humanoids other than [[maedar]] can only produce fully medusa female offspring. Though Marrec is written as clearly male, he displayed medusa-like secondary sexual characteristics, such as hair snakes at birth. The text strongly implies that Marrec's father was not immune to petrifying gaze, and thusly, should've produced female offspring. While maedar can produce male offspring and can inherit petrifying gazes as Marrec did, they also lack hair snakes. Thanial Selwander claims to have cut off his snakes without protest. While it could be argued that Marrec is a first-generation maedar with vestigial hair snakes and possessing a mutation for petrifying gaze, much like the alien conqueror [[Vulkaran]], the text describes him as having at least one human parent, per Thanial Selwander; the article thus proceeds as though Marrec is best described as a unique half-medusa, an interpretation the text seems to favor. he fled the village where he was born after his petrifying gaze made him a pariah,

==Description==
Marrec's hairline hid several scars,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|8|2}} where hair-snakes had grown as an infant.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|62|7}} He wore full plate armor everywhere, even while walking cross-country.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|9|2}} His voice was normally a smooth baritone.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|18|2}}

==Personality==
Marrec was not that much of a talker, rarely getting in a word edgewise when talking about life with someone else.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|111|12}} He also liked to joke just after heading off of dire straits, but he could lapse into grandiloquence when he found the situation dire.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|151|15}} He was also sensitive to the situation of foundlings like him,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|112|12}} and on the lookout for those who could grant redemption to vile creatures.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|209|21}}

==Abilities==
Marrec was more than competent in the use of the spear; this, combined with his unique spear, ''[[Justlance]]'', made him a frightful combatant.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|9-11|2}} Unaffected by the fading of Lurue's light, however, was his ability to petrify those on whom he fixed his gaze when he so desired, thanks to his [[medusa]] inheritance: his petrifying gaze was powerful enough to afflict even the normal immunities of oozing blightlords like [[Anammelech]],{{cite book/Lady of Poison|158|15}} swarming insects,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|257|27}} and even anathematic, ungodly [[abomination]]s.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|291-292|30}}

==Possessions==
Marrec was the wielder of ''[[Justlance]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|13|2}} and he wore a set of plate armor.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|127|13}} those gauntlets provided a varying strength boost on demand,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|147-148|15}} though they eventually depleted.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|157|15}} Marrec was also provided a unique potion from the Nentyarch, probably ''[[owl's wisdom]]'', which allowed him to access a fraction of his priestly power despite the weakened connection, and also enlightened him as to how to restore Araluen's power.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|284|30}}

==Relationships==
Marrec's aunts by blood were [[Sthenno]] and [[Euryale]], almost certainly medusae. He was adopted at a young age by [[Harmon]] and [[Celia]], two villagers, and lived amongst their natural born children, including [[Emmon]], who became his closest friend; the village as a whole forsook him on learning of his medusa heritage. He was then taken in as an apprentice woodsman by [[Thanial Selwander]], who became his mentor, confidante, and new best friend, up until Marrec accidentally petrified him during an [[ogre]] raid on the village.

He became friends with [[Gunggari Ulmarra]] sometime before {{yearlink|1373}}; they were so close that Gunggari accompanied him in his quest to regain his connection to Lurue by finding the Child of Light. During the quest, he bonded with [[Elowen]], [[Ususi Manaallin]], and [[Araluen]]. He also bonded with a demon, [[The Victorious Slayer of Compassion]], whom he nicknamed Victoricus, and said demon's queen, the [[Queen Abiding]], with whom he gained a very literal bond, though a short-lived one.

==History==
At some point before {{yearlink|1373}}, Marrec became lost in the woods while playing with his aunt [[Sthenno]],{{cite book/Lady of Poison|91-92|10}} at the age of one and a half years old. He was found by [[Thanial Selwander]], who cut off his hair snakes without incident,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|61|7}} and then gave him to the cobbler [[Harmon]], who raised the young boy. Marrec and his brother [[Emmon]] both loved the wild. Once, when they were eleven and trekking, they took refuge from a freezing downpour in a cave, coming across a bear. Marrec improvised a spear from a stick on the spot, and managed to keep the bear at bay, though Emmon was injured. This incident later encouraged Marrec to join the local militia.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|24-26|3}}

At the age of sixteen, the village where Marrec and Emmon resided was attacked by the [[Durang]] ogres; after Emmon was slain, Marrec discovered his power to focus his gaze into a petrifying attack. However, the display of this power made no one want more to do with him in the village.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|37-40|4}} He fled into the wild, only for Thanial Selwander to find him again; the outdoorsman took him in, teaching him the ways of the wild. More than that, Thanial finally told him of his heritage;{{cite book/Lady of Poison|58-62|7}} the two agreed to try and use it for good. However, when Marrec attempted to slay the Durang leader with it, the power backfired, catching Thanial Selwander together with the ogre. Marrec swore never to call upon his petrifying power again after this incident.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|113-116|12}}

By {{yearlink|1373}}, Marrec was a [[cleric]] of [[Lurue]]. He had also discovered that his communion with his goddess had thinned, taking away his powers; he also received an omen, calling on him to "Seek out the Child of Light in [[Hemish]]'s charge", which led him to [[Fullpoint]] in [[Thesk]], after using more divination spells to decrypt the vision. Together with his friend [[Gunggari Ulmarra]], he crossed Faer√ªn, heading for Fullpoint, the connection thinning all the way, attempting to fulfill the goddess' mandate. In the last leg of their voyage, they arrived by ship on [[Telflamm]], and took the [[Golden Way]] towards Fullpoint.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|17|2}} and rescued a girl named Ash, whom he took to be the one in his omen.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|23|3}} After persuading her father Hemish to let her come with him, he accompanied the [[Nentyar hunter]] [[Elowen]] to [[Two Stars]], where they consulted with [[Ususi Manaallin]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|34|4}} She joined their party, and the five of them headed for the [[Mucklestones]],{{cite book/Lady of Poison|54-55|6}} where they battled the [[Talontar blightlord]] [[Gameliel]] in order to rescue [[Briartan]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|83-84|9}}

Ususi then took them to [[Yeshelmaar]] so that Marrec and Elowen could confer directly with the [[Nentyarch]], the leader of the [[Circle of Leth]] to which both Elowen and Briartan belonged. The Nentyarch bade Elowen and Marrec escort Ash, who was actually Araluen, to [[Dun-Tharos]], where the [[Rotting Man]] was stealing her power.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|125|13}} However, the Nentyar hunter [[Fallon]] betrayed the Nentyarch and kidnapped Ash.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|133|14}} Marrec's party followed quickly, into an ambush by the blightlord [[Anammelech]], Fallon's paymaster.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|145|14}} Just as Anammelech was about to execute Marrec, he broke his vow and struck back with his petrifying gaze, quickly turning the tables on the blightlord.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|158|15}}

The four of them followed Fallon's trail to [[Under-Tharos]], where they were soon pressed into the service of a [[demon]], the [[Queen Abiding]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|187|18}} Marrec managed to recover her controlling token from her rival, [[Eschar]], and released her, barely managing to wrest one single service from her in the process, and even then only if she felt it furthered her own ends.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|239|25}} The party soon caught up to a third blightlord, the [[vampire]] [[Damanda]], who was holding Fallon and Araluen. Though Fallon saved Elowen's life in the fight, he was mortally wounded.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|258-259|27}}

When the party came towards [[The Close]], Marrec was forced to call upon the deal with the [[Queen Abiding]] to eliminate the Rotting Man's soldiers blocking their way into the fortress.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|275-276|29}} Once inside they met the Rotting Man; he set the [[Step-Daughter of Talona]] upon them.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288|30}} His petrifying gaze was of limited use against her.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|291-292|30}} Thanks to the insight provided by a potion the Nentyarch gave him, Marrec regained some of his priestly power, and came to understand that he could disable the Step-Daughter by convincing Araluen to forgive herself for having been captured and twisted by the Rotting Man. He quickly helped her, and once the Step-Daughter devoured Ash, the two became a restored Araluen{{cite book/Lady of Poison|293-297|30}} and imparted upon Marrec the knowledge of how to restore to flesh his mentor, Thanial Selwander.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|305-306|Epilogue}}

By [[Tarsakh]] of the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, he had departed on a different quest.{{cite book/Darkvision|10|2}}
