        "Description": "Rienur was a notoriously cantankerous, especially for a [[halfling]]. His attitude could put a mad [[half-orc]] to shame.",
        "History": "Rienur was part of the ''Vigilant's'' crew in the {{Yearlink|1374}} when Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]]'s ship sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who traveled to meet with a wealthy [[yuan-ti]] merchant, [[Sa'Sani]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater [[barrel]]s ruptured; one of the crew, a sailor got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned as his poison soup took the life of [[Joquin]]; and Rienur noticed new [[rope]]s becaming strangely frayed.\n\nThe halfling's life ended when the string of occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]]. Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be devoured by the local cannibalistic [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s."
