'''Alec IV''' of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]] was High King of [[Callidyrr]] at the turn of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}} Like his predecessors, although he held the title of High King of the [[Moonshae Isles]], he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the [[Ffolk]] outside of Callidyrr.

==Relationships==
He was a member of the Carrathal royal family of Callidyrr and was the first son of his predecessor, [[Benjamin Carrathal|King Benjamin]]. His eventual successor was his third son, [[Reginald Carrathal|Reginald]], who would go on to be the last Carrathal to sit the throne.

==History==
Alex IV assumed the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1296}}, after the assassination of his father. He ruled for thirty-six years before dying of natural causes in the {{YearlinkName|1332}}.

[[1330 DR|Two years prior]] to the end of his reign, the [[Great Druid of the Moonshaes]], [[Brianna Moonsinger]], was killed while trying to stop the return of [[Kazgaroth]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|30}}
