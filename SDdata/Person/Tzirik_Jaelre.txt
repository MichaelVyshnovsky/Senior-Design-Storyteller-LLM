'''Tzirik Jaelre''' was a [[drow]] high priest of [[Vhaeraun]] and a member of [[House Jaelre]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was short, stocky, and—unusual for a drow—bald. He wore black [[mithral]] [[plate armor]] with [[demon]]ic figures and [[gold]] filigree, with a ceremonial veil of black [[silk]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Tzirik was approached by a group of drow led by [[Quenthel Baenre]] with an old acquaintance, [[Valas Hune]], in tow. The group was investigating the [[Silence of Lolth]] and sought a cleric of another god to inquire about their goddess. Tzirik agreed to do this service for them if they retrieved the ''[[Geildirion of Cimbar]]'' from a [[beholder]] lair in [[Myth Drannor]]. They did so and Tzirik reveled that [[Lolth]] had sealed herself away in the [[Demonweb Pits]]. The group decided to use [[astral projection]] to visit the Demonweb Pits and supplicate the goddess themselves. Tzirik escorted them. Once in front of Lolth's temple, Tzirik gated in Vhaeraun, who began attacking the face of Lolth. When the other drow turned on him, he used his [[divine magic]] to push them back until [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] ordered [[Jeggred Baenre]], who had stayed behind to guard the group's bodies, to slay Tzirik's physical form, thus returning the group to the [[Material Plane]].
