'''Kalah''' was a [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] who worked in a circus that toured [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

{{quote|''A gnome came on the stage and began to perform some kind of magical act. It was quite silly... it was obvious that whatever the gnome was trying to do wasn't working. His magic fizzled, and everyone started laughing! I thought it was part of the act, so I laughed too! And then everything began changing! People started transforming into creatures and then back into themselves. The world shifted somehow, and I felt so sick and horrified...''|[[Hannah]]}}

==History==
He grew bitter at being made fun of and, when the circus stopped at [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in [[Athkatla]], Amn, in [[1369 DR]], he used powers he had gained from an unknown source to turn the inside of the circus tent into an unreasonably large world of [[illusion]]s in the middle of his act. Some people trapped within were killed and others were seemingly turned into various monsters, like [[Aerie]] and [[Quayle]]. The illusory world was also populated by [[shadow]]s and [[werewolf|werewolves]], some of which were real enough to hurt people they attacked and others of which only became so if they were attacked back. Kalah himself appeared as an ogre-sized figure more impressive than his usual self.

If [[Gorion's Ward]] and party entered the tent while in Athkatla, they might've saved some of the people trapped within and defeated Kalah, turning everything back to normal except for those people who seemed to have simply disappeared after dying. Before dying, Kalah shouted "This is not what was promised to me!".There may have been another side-quest in ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' elaborating on Kalah's background. However, it was never included in the final game, but a version was restored by the Unfinished Business fan mod.
