        "mainbody": "Galvan Longarms was a firbolg proxy of the Giantish power known as Hiatea.\nLike all proxies of Hiatea, this firbolg was unusually large and strong for his race.\nGalvan had a deep hatred for evil giants and their deities.\nGalvan dressed in a set of scale armor, fashioned from the scales of a hydra, and carried two huge flaming spears +3. These functioned similarly to sun blades.\nThough Galvan would never betray Hiatea, he would take some indirect action to aid those seeking to combat giants."
