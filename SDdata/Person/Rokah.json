Rokah was tasked with infiltrating Fort Beluarian and acquiring proof of this arrangement with which to blackmail the forts commander, Liara Portyr. To achieve this, he sought to hire adventurers to escort him from Port Nyanzaru to the fort and then to create a distraction that would allow him to search Portyrs private quarters."
