'''Kastner''' was one of the overseers and a priestess of [[Lolth]] under Matron [[Azurna]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], High Priestess of the Spider Queen Azurna was leading the drow forces in the divine quest for the ''[[Flame Sword of Lolth]]''. The magic weapon was the long-lost [[artifact]] from the [[War of the Seldarine]], hidden in [[Undermountain]]. The drow built a coalition to find the item and bring down [[Waterdeep]]. During that pursuit, Kastner was stationed in one of the deep strongholds. She held a position supervising the younger clerics of the Spider Queen. One of the priestesses was [[Eskylla]], a traitor to Lolth. The young cleric had been introduced to the faith of [[Eilistraee]] and wanted to escape Azurna's army. She achieved freedom with the help of [[Khelbenite]], who agreed to murder Kastner during his struggle against the evil conspirators.
