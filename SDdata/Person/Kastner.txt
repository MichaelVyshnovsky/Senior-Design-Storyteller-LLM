Kastner was one of the overseers and a priestess of Lolth under Matron Azurna in the midâ€“14 century DR.
In 1370 DR, High Priestess of the Spider Queen Azurna was leading the drow forces in the divine quest for the Flame Sword of Lolth. The magic weapon was the long-lost artifact from the War of the Seldarine, hidden in Undermountain. The drow built a coalition to find the item and bring down Waterdeep. During that pursuit, Kastner was stationed in one of the deep strongholds. She held a position supervising the younger clerics of the Spider Queen. One of the priestesses was Eskylla, a traitor to Lolth. The young cleric had been introduced to the faith of Eilistraee and wanted to escape Azurnas army. She achieved freedom with the help of Khelbenite, who agreed to murder Kastner during his struggle against the evil conspirators.
