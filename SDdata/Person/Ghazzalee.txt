'''Ghazzalee''' was a [[Netherese]] [[priest]] and [[arcanist]] who managed [[Ioulaum Industries]] in [[Eileanar]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Personality==
She was a hard-working and organized individual, who tried to deal fairly with others whenever possible.

==Activities==
Ghazzalee oversaw the facilities in Eileanar on behalf of [[Ioulaum]] himself, as he was too busy with his own projects. She was assisted by [[Fabbra]], [[Ryckaert]], and [[Theobald]], each of them accomplished arcanists who performed their work well.
