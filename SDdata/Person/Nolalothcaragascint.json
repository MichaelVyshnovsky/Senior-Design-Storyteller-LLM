        "mainbody": "'''Nolalothcaragascint''', or '''Nolaloth''' for a short, was a [[crystal dragon]] [[great wyrm]] who was asked by the realm of [[Illefarn]] to destroy their great [[King of Shadows|Guardian]] following the fall of [[Netheril]].",
        "History": {
            "Battle with the King of Shadows": "The Guardian had been created from one of Illefarn's greatest champions, with his soul tied to the [[Weave]] to become a [[construct]] of power great enough to deter [[Netherese]] attack. But, in {{Yearlink|-339}}, when the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Karsus]] cast the spell ''[[Karsus's avatar]]'' and the then goddess of magic [[Mystryl]] sacrificed herself to save the Weave, the Weave ceased to exist long enough for the Guardian to lose its power source. Instead of accepting its fate and dying, however, it linked itself to [[Shar]]'s [[Shadow Weave]] and became the [[King of Shadows]].\n\n[[File:DragonHeart.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The heart of Nolaloth floating in his valley.'']]\nFollowing the King's defeat of several great Illefarn warriors, the ruling council of Illefarn asked the great wyrm Nolalothcaragascint to destroy it in exchange for a massive addition to his hoard from the empire's coffers. The dragon accepted and flew into battle. A titanic struggle erupted that shook the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]], but in the end the King of Shadows overcame the dragon and struck him to the earth, creating a massive valley in the [[Sword Mountains]].\n\nBut thankfully for Illefarn, the dragon's sacrifice was not entirely in vain: the King of Shadows was so badly injured in the battle that it was forced to retreat to the [[Plane of Shadow]] to recover, where it remained for over a thousand years. And the dying Nolaloth was \"saved\" by the ruling council, who transformed his heart into an enormous floating crystal, into which the wyrm's soul was laid in a process reminiscent of the crafting of a [[lich]]'s [[phylactery]]."
        },
        "Advisor to Heroes": "Over the centuries, the great wyrm's valley became an oasis of fertility in the Sword Mountains, being warm year-round thanks to the heart's influence, and a haven for young dragons of all species. Though immobile, the great drake could still speak and people occasionally came to him to learn, particularly about the King of Shadows.\n\nFirst to come were the [[githyanki]]. the King of Shadows made its first forays into the universe outside the [[Plane of Shadows]]. It forced open a [[portal]] into the [[Astral Plane]], sending its Nightwalker avatar to attempt conquest of the now-defunct Illefarn. The [[Githyanki silver sword|giths' silver swords]] were enough to fight it off, but at a terrible cost in lives, and the King simply shrugged and recreated the Nightwalker. The Lich-Queen [[Vlaakith]] sent her warriors to [[Faerûn]] to learn more of her people's seemingly indestructible foe, and found Nolaloth in his valley. He advised them to attack the portal itself, extracting a return promise that the githyanki would return him to life. The githyanki were successful, but either forgot or ignored their promise to Nolaloth.\n\nIn the mid-1300s DR, an [[archmage]] of [[Neverwinter]] named [[Ammon Jerro]], while studying in his time off, uncovered information leading to the King of Shadows and that explained some recent strange happenings on the Sword Coast North. His search for answers led him to Nolaloth, and in exchange for the same promise he extracted from Vlaakith's emissaries (to return him to life), the dragon informed him of the githyanki's success against the King with their silver swords, and told him of the mightiest silver sword of them all: the [[Silver Sword of Gith]], lost with its wielder millennia before in the [[Nine Hells]]. Only the Sword of Gith might have the power to unmake the King once and for all.\n\nJerro immediately left for the Nine Hells, recovered the Sword with the aid of [[Levistus]], Lord of the Seventh Circle, and then led a force of Neverwinter's soldiers into battle against the King of Shadows in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. The King was once again defeated, but the Sword was shattered—with one shard burying itself in the chest of an infant—and Ammon Jerro was blown into the Hells.",
        "Encounter with the Kalach-Cha": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, that infant was now Knight-Captain of [[Crossroad Keep]] and known as the [[Kalach-Cha]] after the shard. They were informed by their [[githzerai]] ally [[Zhjaeve]] that they needed the Silver Sword of Gith to defeat the now-thrice-resurgent King of Shadows. Ammon Jerro, having escaped from the Hells and now working with the Kalach-Cha, told them of what he had learned from Nolaloth. The party immediately left for the dragon's valley.\n\nAs they stood below the great crystal heart, they noticed a pair of [[Black dragon|black dragons]] perched on the cliffs above, simply watching them.  They proceeded warily into the northern passage, where they encountered Nolaloth himself. At first Nolaloth refused to help them, his ghostly head vanishing, but then the Kalach-Cha mentioned the return of the King of Shadows. Nolaloth agreed to help them, telling that to reforge the Sword of Gith, they must return to where it was broken: a scar on the earth in [[West Harbor]]. This time, the dragon was tired of living half a life, and asked the Kalach-Cha to repay him for his aid by destroying his heart, and freeing him from his torment."
