        "mainbody": "'''Anskaler Muldryn''' was the master smith and the proprietor of [[Muldryn's Chainworks]] in the [[Shutters]] neighborhood of the [[Crow's End]] District in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Muldryn-work chains required hard work and strong physique. Because of that, Anskaler was said to had been the strongest person in the Bluff of his time. Once, he lifted an entire coach wagon to rescue a child from under it.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Anskaler Muldryn was renown for his heavy-duty chains. Crude and strong, Muldryn-work never interested jewelry-makers but attracted drovers seeking replacement [[wagon]]-links and [[warrior]]s seeking sturdy [[chain]]-weapons."
