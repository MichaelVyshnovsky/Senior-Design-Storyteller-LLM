Solndor Brightstar was a cleric of Lathander that served as a spiritual leader among the people of Idyllglen.
Solndor was the ancestor of Jhessa Brightstar, who carried on the tradition of service to the Lathanderian church.
When Idyllglen was threatened by a vicious collective of gnoll tribes, Solndor beseeched his god Lathander for aid. Lathander dispatched the solar Zariel to save the people Idyllglen and drive away the bestial marauders.
