        "mainbody": "Her Excellency, Lady Kyrin Hawkwinter was the Countess of Calimmon in Tethyr and Horselady of Her Majestys Cavalry. She was known as a superb rider, horse breeder, and military strategist, with a strong will.\nWhile Tethyrian by descent, Kyrin was not of noble Tethyrian blood and in fact was born and raised outside of Tethyr in the city of Waterdeep. She was a member of that cities Hawkwinter Clan, being its sixth child and second daughter.\nIn 1360 DR, Kyrin met the future queen of Tethyr, Zaranda Star, and fought with her against the Tuigan Horde.\nIn the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, when Prince Haedrak III entered Waterdeep and was announced as Tethyrs rightful heir, Kyrin was one of those who joined his army and took control of its cavalry, many of whom were provided by Lord Zelphar Thann.\nAfter the Reclamation Wars, Queen Zaranda granted her and her descendants the county of Calimmon.\nAs Horselady, the commander of Tethyrs cavalry, Kyrin served under Lady Vajra Valmeyjar, the Royal Warlady of Tethyr.\nKyrins home was el Daraqadim, which she preferred to call \"the Cliff\". She expanded the old Calishite manor with the addition of large stables and stronger outer defenses, which were designed by Count Zelphar Thann, her friend.\nKyrin was the daughter of Eremoes and Kyrin Hawkwinter. Her oldest brother, Genos, was the heir of the Hawkwinter family. She was the twin sister of Jornos Hawkwinter. Her nephew and Jornos son was Geiron Hawkwinter, and the young lad sneaked away with her when she left Waterdeep for Tethyr to fight in the war, against his mothers desires.\nKyrin was engaged to marry the paladin Garron Ersemm in 1371 DR, but her farsann, Rontal Qirattar, secretly planned to dispose of Garron before the wedding. Garron had also traveled with her from Waterdeep to Tethyr.\nDue to some tactless remarks by Kyrin, a rumor had started among the troops that she cared more about horses than soldiers, leading to a rivalry between her troops and those of the Marchlord, Count Rikos Dughol."
