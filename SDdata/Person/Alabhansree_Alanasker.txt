'''Alabhansree Alanasker''', also known as '''Cymra Shanbadhe''' and '''"The Lady in Silver"''', was a [[Tashalan]] [[human]] and the former Chansreena (princess) of the city-state of [[Ormpur]] in [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}

==History==
In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Alabhansree went missing from Ormpur. Also missing were many magical blades that had been kept hidden in secret storage niches in the palace, and a large amount of [[saffron]], comprising Ormpur's entire reserve, as well as other [[spices]], all of it a fortune intended as her dowry. Obsessed with finding her, Helbareim spent a good deal of the city's treasury in efforts to locate and retrieve Alabhansree, all without success. He first suspected several notorious thieves: [[Hoond]] of [[Shussel]], [[Veldyn Uruin|Veldyn "the Fingers" Uruin]], and even the adventurer [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]]. The whole Ormpurian court believed the thief had originated from the [[North]], and Ormpurian agents in [[Waterdeep]] hunted for information in that city and all along the [[Sword Coast]]. Rumors in Sword Coast ports suggested they'd taken a ship to [[Mintarn]] or the [[Moonshae Isles]]. Later, based on false reports, he hired a number of [[adventuring companies]] to raid the slave pits of [[Llurth Dreier]], a [[drow]] city in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Shaar]]. However, he would not find a single clue to her true fate, and these failures broke his spirit by [[1373 DR]].

In fact, unknown to him, Alabhansree had fled the city with her lover, the pirate [[Cairak Redbeard]] of the [[Nelanther Isles]], and sailed to the Moonshae Isles. Cairak was easily able to sell off the stolen saffron at Sword Coast ports, slowly but gaining maximum profit. In the Moonshaes, Alabhansree adopted an illusory disguise and the name "Cymra Shanbadhe", borrowed from an extinct local [[Ffolk]]–[[Llewyrr]] family, but earned the nickname "The Lady in Silver" from the Ffolk. She used her [[magic]] and riches to construct a well-defended tower stronghold at Eiresse, setting herself up as a [[wizard]].

By 1373 DR, Alabhansree and Cairak still dwelled in Eiresse in the Moonshaes.

==Relations==
Alabhansree was the only daughter and sole heir of High Suikh (king) [[Helbareim Alanasker]], ruler of Ormpur. However, he was a strict and almost tyrannical father. Cold and uncaring, he saw her as a commodity to be traded in marriage to anyone if it was in his interests. She seized the chance to escape his control. Her disappearance broke his spirit but he remained obsessed with locating her. With his daughter missing, Helbareim was left the last of his line.

==Home==
Alabhansree and Cairak made their home in a small tower in the cozy pirate cove of [[Eiresse]], on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the Moonshaes. Her tower was a stronghold, well defended by magical guardians and traps, such as "teeter-totter" floors than dumped trespassers into winding natural sinkholes that led to the sea, where [[giant octopus]]es laired.

==Ability==
She was magically skilled.

==Description==
Alabhansree was considered a beauty. However, in the Moonshaes, she adopted an [[illusion|illusory]] disguise as "Cymra Shanbadhe".
