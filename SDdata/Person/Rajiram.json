        "mainbody": "Red Baron of Nelather\nBaron Rajiram () was a cloud giant smiling one and pirate captain of the Sword Coast the late 15 century DR. Following the breaking of the Ordning in the 1480s DR, he sought the Ark of the Mountains.\nRajiram was smaller than most cloud giants. He covered his features with a bifurcated red mask - one half depicting a smile, the other half a scowl.\nRajiram was particularly greedy and was also quite intelligent.\nRajiram was a powerful spellcaster. As a cloud giant, he could cast spells such as gaseous form and control weather. As a bard, he had access to spells like major image and tongues. He also had the ability to change his shape and assume the form of beasts or humanoids that he had encountered previously.\nRajirams pirate ship was Thunderbound, a flying galleon with multiple decks. . Rajiram carried a staff of thunder and lightning. He used the staff to control the weather around Thunderbound.\nRajiram sometimes used a simulacrum of himself to take his place. The simulacrum could communicate telepathically with Rajiram.\nSo that he could improve his position in the Ordning, Rajiram pillaged treasure and magic items.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Rajiram conducted most of his piracy along the Sword Coast and on the Sea of Swords.\nRajirams crew included many humans from the Nelanther Isles.\nAlso serving in his crew were minotaurs, goblins, and oni.\nAmong the notable members of his crew were Boff Badcrack the hill giant Mouth of Grolantor and Sl√°turhaust the storm giant quintessent. \nRajirams followers were completely devoted to him they feared his anger more than they feared death. He gave frost brand scimitars to the pirates he liked the most.\nRajiram was exiled from his home, and so came to the Nelanther Isles. There, he won favor with the pirates that lived there and rose to become a powerful pirate captain himself.\nThe Baron was active for at least decades before the 1480s DR, when he clashed with SEER and Bitter-root of the Lords Alliance.\nIn the 1480s DR, Rajiram attacked Durlags Tower, Later, as the adventurers entered into the tower, Rajiram sent his simulacrum to obtain the tablet. The adventurers countered Rajirams efforts and recovered the tablet.\nLater, Rajiram sent his followers from his flying ship to plunder the ruins of the Ulcaster School of Wizardry near Beregost. SEER and the recently-revived Ulcaster, sent adventurers to protect Ulcasters secret library from the pirates.\nStill desperate to recover the tablet that had once been in Durlags Tower, Rajiram sent a message to Beregost. Unless the tablet was given to him, he threatened to violently destroy Beregost from Thunderbound. In order to save the town, SEER gathered adventurers together and raised the Ark of the Mountains from Durlags Tower. The adventurers took control of the Ark, and flew it in an epic sky battle against the Baron."
