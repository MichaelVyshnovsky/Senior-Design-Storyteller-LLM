        "mainbody": "'''Baron Rajiram''' ({{Pronounce|BAH|ron rah|JEER|am|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tower|22}}}}) was a [[cloud giant]] [[smiling one]] and pirate captain of the [[Sword Coast]] the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Following the breaking of the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] in the 1480s [[DR]], he sought the ''[[Ark of the Mountains (ship)|Ark of the Mountains]]''.\n{{Quote|Look to the the skies, little mice. I'm coming.|Baron Rajiram's warning}}",
        "Description": "Rajiram was smaller than most cloud giants. He covered his features with a bifurcated red [[mask (object)|mask]] - one half depicting a smile, the other half a scowl.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|Turn out your pockets so I needn’t suffer the indignity of emptying them after you’ve died|Baron Rajiram}}\n\nRajiram was particularly greedy and was also quite intelligent.",
        "Abilities": "Rajiram was a powerful spellcaster. As a cloud giant, he could cast spells such as ''[[gaseous form]]'' and ''[[control weather]]''. As a bard, he had access to spells like ''[[major image]]'' and ''[[tongues]]''. He also had the ability to change his shape and assume the form of [[beast]]s or [[humanoid]]s that he had encountered previously.",
        "Possessions": "Rajiram's pirate ship was ''[[Thunderbound]]'', a flying galleon with multiple decks. .{{Cite adventurers league/The Ark of the Mountains|9}} Rajiram carried a ''[[staff of thunder and lightning]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/The Ark of the Mountains|46}} He used the staff to control the weather around ''Thunderbound''.\n\nRajiram sometimes used a [[simulacrum]] of himself to take his place. The simulacrum could communicate [[telepathy|telepathically]] with Rajiram.{{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tower|19}}",
        "Activities": "So that he could improve his position in the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]], Rajiram pillaged treasure and magic items.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation|6}}\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Rajiram conducted most of his piracy along the [[Sword Coast]] and on the [[Sea of Swords]].{{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tower|7}}",
        "Relationships": "Rajiram's crew included many [[human]]s from the Nelanther Isles.\nAlso serving in his crew were [[minotaur]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[oni]].\n\nAmong the notable members of his crew were [[Boff Badcrack]] the [[hill giant]] [[Mouth of Grolantor]] and [[Sláturhaust]] the [[storm giant]] [[quintessent]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Mysterious Isle|4}} \n\nRajiram's followers were completely devoted to him; they feared his anger more than they feared death.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation|10}} He gave [[frost brand]] [[scimitar]]s to the pirates he liked the most.{{Cite adventurers league/The Ark of the Mountains|15}}",
        "History": "Rajiram was exiled from his home, and so came to the [[Nelanther Isles]]. There, he won favor with the pirates that lived there and rose to become a powerful pirate captain himself.\n\nThe Baron was active for at least decades before the 1480s [[DR]], when he clashed with [[SEER]] and [[Bitter-root]] of the [[Lords' Alliance]].{{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tower|13}}\n\nIn the 1480s [[DR]], Rajiram attacked [[Durlag's Tower]],{{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tower|14}} Later, as the adventurers entered into the tower, Rajiram sent his simulacrum to obtain the tablet.{{Cite adventurers league/Durlag's Tomb|19}} The adventurers countered Rajiram's efforts and recovered the tablet.\n\nLater, Rajiram sent his followers from his flying ship to plunder the ruins of the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]] near [[Beregost]].{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation|4-5}} SEER and the recently-revived [[Ulcaster]], sent adventurers to protect Ulcaster's secret library from the pirates.\n\nStill desperate to recover the tablet that had once been in [[Durlag's Tower]], Rajiram sent a message to [[Beregost]]. Unless the tablet was given to him, he threatened to violently destroy Beregost from ''Thunderbound''. In order to save the town, SEER gathered adventurers together and raised the ''Ark of the Mountains'' from Durlag's Tower. The adventurers took control of the Ark, and flew it in an epic sky battle against the Baron."
