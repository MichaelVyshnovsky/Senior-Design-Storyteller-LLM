        "mainbody": "'''Taline Telgara''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|902}} to {{yearlink|946}}. She was considered one of the greatest Magisters.",
        "Description": "In her youth, Taline Telgara had been amber-haired and black-browed. She was a beauty from a very young age.",
        "Personality": "Taline never lost her love of leaping around. While on her own, she spent much time together with other mages.",
        "History": "Born in a foresters' hamlet near [[Everlund]], Taline was orphaned by [[orcish]] raids and became adopted by [[Mroarild Sarvarada]] and [[Nanath Sarvarada]], who were entertainers and sellers of jewelry. She joined them during their performances, which were firmly three-person affairs on her father's insistence, to better protect her from admirers: she looked older than she was. Nanath was also a hedge mage, and taught Taline some magic; craving more, she took to prowling rooftops whenever they were in a town large enough for mage's towers. One night she witnessed a thief killing a mage in his tower, and struck inside, incapacitating the thief with a kick to the throat and taking a spellbook for her own. She began using her birth family name again after the Sarvaradas retired.\n\nTaline began to attend [[magefair]]s; she joined an adventuring band, the [[Swords Aflame]], in one. With them, she breached many tombs for the magic within, acquring no less than forty spellbooks between her and the band's other two mages. On her suggestion, they hid some of their treasures in hollow minarets, guarded by [[dread]]s and [[crawling claw]]s. After the band split up, Taline laid a trap for her fellow surviving wizard and slew him in a spell-battle, which went narrowly for her. She resolved not to win that closely ever again: she acquired more defensive items and began to learn more powerful spells, visiting magefairs and mages' guilds again.\n\nAfter defending herself from [[Jonsryn Daerathal]] and destroying him, Taline Telgara acquired the office of the Magister. Believing her time with it may be short, she gave magic away freely throughout her tenure, and used spells to fly across the countryside constantly, finding people to aid. She did not hesitate to ask for aid from unknown mages rather than whisk herself away to caches prepared in advance when she was wounded in such forays. Despite her recklessness, no cabals slew her during a flight, to the surprise of many mages.\n\nWith old age setting in, she reduced her flights and began to spend longer in writing down spells and seeing to unfinished business. At about that time, she was courted by [[Caldauvur Maerglauthyn]], with whom she began to take flights, this time in ''[[dragonshape]]''. They were wed by fall; unfortunately, one of her magical wards was triggered during their wedding night, and transformed him into his normal shape. She did not survive.",
        "Rumors": "It was believed that [[Azuth]] or [[Mystra]] may have been the reason no cabal of malevolent mages slew her during her flights. Mystra was also believed to have guided Taline Telgara to Waterdeep during one of her trips, so as to inspire young [[Ahghairon]], whom it appeared that she had later sought out.\n\nAccording to minstrels, Taline's reputation for carnality was such that she was said to have loved all of Faer√ªn- frequently. According to mages of the time, right before she became Magister, she inspired awe in all mages, and love to many.\n\n{{quote|All wizards of the day were awed by her, and many loved her.|[[Nlaergus]]}}"
