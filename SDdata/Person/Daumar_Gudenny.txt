'''Daumar Gudenny''' was an ex-assassin and spy for the [[Bruil]] family of [[Melvaunt]]. During his time in the city, he also often operated within the land of [[Thar]]. A self-exiled [[spirit folk]] from [[Rashemen]], he was obsessed with the legends of [[Vorbyx]], the First King of Thar, as some theories surrounding him suggested that the ancient king shared his lineage.

==Appearance==
Standing a bit over six feet (two meters) tall, Daumar had green eyes that glowed with an eerie, otherworldly light. His thick, reddish-brown hair hung freely around his shoulders somewhat resembling the mane of a [[lion]].
