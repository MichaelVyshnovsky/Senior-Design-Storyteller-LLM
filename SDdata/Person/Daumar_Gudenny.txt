Daumar Gudenny was an ex-assassin and spy for the Bruil family of Melvaunt. During his time in the city, he also often operated within the land of Thar. A self-exiled spirit folk from Rashemen, he was obsessed with the legends of Vorbyx, the First King of Thar, as some theories surrounding him suggested that the ancient king shared his lineage.
Standing a bit over six feet (two meters) tall, Daumar had green eyes that glowed with an eerie, otherworldly light. His thick, reddish-brown hair hung freely around his shoulders somewhat resembling the mane of a lion.
