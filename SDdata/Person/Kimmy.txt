Kimmy Diallo was Monifa Diallos daughter from the Rivington district of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Kimmy looked a lot like her mother, she shared her dark skin, brown eyes, and curly brown har that framed her cherubic face.
In the , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldurs Gate closed the Wyrms Crossing bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Monifa Diallo, Kimmys mother, believed the Upper City did not care for the looming danger and possible deaths of everyone in Rivington. However, she did not wish to scare Kimmy.
