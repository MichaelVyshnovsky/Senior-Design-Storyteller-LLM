Shodsi Minuku was one of the Merchant-Lords of Imdolphyn as of 1479 DR.
Unlike the other Merchant-Lords of Imdolphym, Shodsi was truly concerned with the welfare of her city, spending more time debating trade policy with the other Merchant-Lords than running her familys share of the fashion industry. She was also one of few Imdarms who were aware of the true dangers of the primordial cults of the Windrise Ports, and, in 1479 DR, was investigating the possibility of the presence of such cults in Imdolphyn.
