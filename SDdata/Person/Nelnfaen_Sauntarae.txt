'''Nelnfaen Sauntarae''' was the only [[drow]] [[Magister]]. He hailed from [[Sshamath]] and reigned from [[1104 DR]] to [[1126 DR]].

==History==
Nelnfaen was the Master of Alteration in Sshamath However, Nelnfaen broke with the Council, becoming a renegade for his wish to spread magic, especially magic not connected to [[faerzress]]. Nelnfaen considered the faerzress as an evil weakness that made the drow subservient to the rulers of their cities, usually clerics of [[Lolth]].

He wandered the [[Underdark]] exploring many areas, especially the [[Upperdark]]. In his tenure as Magister, he befriended some priestesses of [[Eilistraee]] and even a few [[human]]s from [[Waterdeep]]. However, in truth, most human wizards of the surface never realized that there was a Magister in the Underdark and thought it was a time without a Magister.

His fate was unknown, and one day in 1126 DR, [[Azuth]] appeared to [[Olohmber Starnardyn]], offering to him the position of Magister.
