Orth Ironchisel was a duergar warrior and brewmaster inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Orth worked in the Angry Coxswain tavern located in the central section Waterdeeps Dock Ward along the waterfront where Odd Street joined Dock Street. Orth was a slaver who worked closely with the owner of the Angry Coxswain, Ramas Shehepset, to transport slaves to Skuld in Mulhorand through the use of a one-way magical portal found within the tavern.
