adventurer, mercenary
Kheros the Red was an adventurer from Calaunt in the Vast with a crippling fear of blood, later turned priest of Tempus, The Battle Lord, some years before the late 13 century DR.
Sometime before the late 13 century DR, Kheros, a young adventurer from the farmlands of Calaunt, embarked on a path of adventuring. As a mercenary, Kheros achieved some level of success and earned his name working with several adventuring companies. But the life of an adventurer eventually made Kheros repulsed and horrified by the sight of blood. This soon turned into a crippling phobia that drove Kheros mad.
Eventually, he was found by clerics of Tempus, who took the giant-of-a-man in and cared for him. With the help of the Church of Tempus, Kheros eventually overcame his fears. Over the course of several years, he was gradually exposed to the dreaded blood and taught the ways of the Tempuran religion, and became a priest of the God of Battle. The final step in Kheros recovery involved being completely submerged in a bath of blood until almost drowning. Kheros, now known as Kheros the Red, successfully and stoically persevered through the submersion. The priest spent the rest of his life in service of the Church of Tempus and eventually commissioned the creation of an enchanted set of plate armor named Bathed-In-Blood as a reminder of Kheross past struggles.
