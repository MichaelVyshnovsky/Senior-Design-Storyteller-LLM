==Description==
Zhanthi was an old merchant, trader, and nobelwoman who traced her ancestry back to Chultan royalty.

==Personality==
She was considered to be very wise, and few in Port Nyanzaru dared to question her judgment.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|48}} She was calm and collected even during times of crisis,{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|29}} She had sentimental attachments to the memory of ancient Chultan dynasties, and was keen to collect objects of significance to Chultan royalty, such as the [[Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare]].

==Activities==
Zhanthi held a monopoly over all trade in jewels from the Chultan mines and the jewelry made from them, as well as cloth and non[[magic]]al [[Leather armor|leather]], [[studded leather]], and [[hide armor]]s.While Zhanthi sold armor, a different merchant prince, [[Ekene-Afa]] controlled the sale of [[shield]]s. The sale of any magical equipment would require the cooperation of yet another prince, [[Wakanga O'tamu]]. Anyone wishing to engage in the trade of these goods had to deal either with her or her consortium. As part of her control of the jewel trade, her agents and guards policed the [[Jewel Market]] in Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]].

She had a network of [[spies]] who worked undercover to deter jewel [[thieves]] and pickpockets{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|31}} and was known to hire [[adventurer]]s, whom she might supply with [[acid bomb]]s or reward with [[magic item]]s to help them complete their assigned missions.

As a member of the merchant princes' council, she helped to govern Port Nyanzaru from the palace of [[Goldenthrone]].

==Possessions==
Zhanthi owned a lavish and well-defended villa atop Port Nyanzaru's [[Throne Hill]] in the Merchants' Ward. and Zhanthi displayed the bejeweled [[skull]]s of her noble ancestors in [[glass]] cases and in niches in the walls. She received visitors to her villa while seated on a gilded [[throne]] while being [[fan]]ned by her servants.

==Relationships==
Zhanthi was a secret member of the hidden [[Ytepka Society]], To offend her was also to offend the Society. She also had strong professional ties to the [[Zhentarim]] (despite personal disagreements) as well as spies among the [[Flaming Fist]], mostly for the purpose of keeping tabs on these factions' activities. Zhanthi also had spies within the mercenary army of Mother [[Sibonseni]], Port Nyanzaru's wealthy and powerful high priestess of [[Waukeen]]: this included Sibonseni's master-at-arms, [[Kwalu Mosi]].

Her only son, [[Shago]], worked as a guide for the Flaming Fist at [[Fort Beluarian]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR. While it was her understanding that he served as her spy within their ranks, he was in fact more loyal to the Flaming Fist, who he believed to be better equipped to fight back the [[undead]] plaguing Chult. As such, he would only rarely give her any valuable intel, making him one of her less useful spies among the Flaming Fist.

If a rival noble required placating, Zhanthi was known to send entertainers to perform rare plays for them, such as ''[[Winter in the Midnight Garden]]''.

Zhanthi once secured a job for a smuggler named [[Jailo Mek]] working as a beast herder for fellow merchant prince [[Ifan Talro'a]] at the [[dinosaur pens]] in [[Tiryki Anchorage]].

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Zhanthi was one of the richest people in Port Nyanzaru and the eldest among the merchant princes.

At some point, she discovered the relationship between [[Liara Portyr]], the leader of Fort Beluarian, and the pirates of [[Jahaka Anchorage]]. While she did not make this knowledge public, she did arrange for Port Nyanzaru's harbormaster, [[Zindar]], to be able to offer a large reward to dispose of the pirates.

When the [[fiend]]ish pirate [[Idrianne Smoke]] laid siege to Port Nyanzaru during the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Zhanthi leveraged her personal connections to try to force Sibonseni's mercenaries to join the city's defense as well as to learn more about Captain Smoke's true nature.
