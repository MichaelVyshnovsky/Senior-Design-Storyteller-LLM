He ensured they always had a pair of janni bodyguards.\nSaleem was the personal bodyguard of the Grand Caliph, Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir. Saleem also guarded the Grand Caliph whenever he attended the Royal Harim.\nThough he was technically a subordinate of Jiraad, the noble marid treated Saleem as an equal, gaining his loyalty and respect.\nSaleem wielded a powerful magical great scimitar with defender properties."
