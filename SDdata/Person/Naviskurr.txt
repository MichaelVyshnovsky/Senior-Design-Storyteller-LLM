'''Naviskurr''' was a scullery boy at the [[Rain Bird Rooming House]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Naviskurr was not very brave.

==Activities==
He was a scullery boy at the [[Rain Bird Rooming House]]. There, in addition to his normal tasks, he kept a door at the worst room of the kitchens clear of obstructions on instructions from the cook: that door had a carving of a hook-nosed wizard, and was covered in peeling blue paint. He was not very good at this.

==Relationships==
[[Phaerorn]] considered him his least promising scullery boy.

==History==
In early spring of the year {{yearlink|1373}}, Naviskurr was working as a scullery boy in the Rain Bird Rooming House of [[Waterdeep]], where he was being vehemently chastised by the cook for failing to keep a door clear of obstructions; the chastisement included threats of injury and termination. Suddenly, Elminster walked through the door, and gave the man news of his son. When Phaerorn explained to Naviskurr who the man was, the kid fainted.
