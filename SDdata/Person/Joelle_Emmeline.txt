Lady '''Joelle Emmeline''', also known as the '''Thief of Hearts''', was a jewel thief from [[Berdusk]] who became a [[heartwarder]] of [[Sune]], and later her [[chosen]], during the [[Second Sundering]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"[[Kleef Kenric|Kleef]], I'm a Chosen of Sune. My love is healing magic."''| Joelle, while aboard the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]''.}}

==Personality==
Joelle was very free spirited, believing that men and women should not exert control over one in another in their relationships

==Abilities==
As the chosen of Sune, Joelle possessed great command over ''[[charm]]'' magic. She could readily garner the support of another person with a mere smile, and could outright control them with her touch.

==Relationships==
While Joelle shared a divine mission with her fellow chosen [[Malik el Sami]], believed to be a servant of [[Myrkul]], the two had opposing world perspectives. Malik was petty and viewed his relationships as transactional, whereas Joelle put her value in the freedom to share joy and pleasure with others who were open to the experience.

She formed close relationships with the two other chosen who accompanied the pair on their quest, [[Kleef Kenric]] and [[Arietta Seasilver]]. Joelle sought to share her love with Kleef,{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|164}} then later Arietta, as Joelle knew that in order to fulfill the last ritual, someone who was completely in love with another person would have to willingly sacrifice themself. Joelle and Arietta became lovers and grew quite fond of one another during their days traveling across [[Faer√ªn]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|232}}

==History==
Joelle was born an illegitimate daughter of an unnamed lord of Berdusk. She spent much of her life as a thief, specializing in the procurement of valuable [[jewel]]s, until she joined the [[church of Sune]] in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}. One day in the service of Lady Firehair, Joelle awoke to find she had vibrant red hair and was granted the ability to both ''charm'' and heal others as she wished. She also began receiving visions, specifically of a crudely-shaped orb of [[quartz]].

The [[1486 DR|following year]], Joelle was tasked by Sune with the mission of stealing the orb, called the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'', from the [[Hidden Temple of Nishrek]] in the [[orc]] stronghold of [[Big Bone Deep]] in the [[Stonelands]] of [[Cormyr]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|67}} Paired with the unlikely companion of Malik el Sami, who was uniquely charged as the bearer of the ''Eye'', Joelle would take the relic to the temple of the earth [[primordial]] [[Grumbar]] at [[Sadrach's Spire]] in the [[Underchasm]].

Pursued by both vengeful orcs, and [[Shadovar]] agents led by Prince [[Yder Tanthul]], Joelle and Malik sought refuge in [[Marsember]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|49}} There they met the young noblewoman Arietta Seasilver, and the [[Helm]]ite guardsman Kleef Kenric, who joined them on their quest.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|75}} 

The group sailed south across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], taking the ''Eye'' to the lands of the [[Vilhon Reach]], and beyond into the wild forest known as the [[Chondalwood]]. After fighting off more orc raiders and [[shade]]s, the group arrived at the Underchasm and made their way to Sadrach's Spire. With the aid of [[Sadrach]]'s granddaughter [[Gingrid]], they made their way past the keep's [[undead]] denizens and into the catacombs within.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|272}}

Once Joelle and her companions were in Grumbar's temple, Arietta accepted her role as sacrifice and Joelle realized her feelings for the young noblewoman.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|287}} When Malik turned on the group and tried to kill Arietta in the name of Cryic, Joelle intercepted the fatal blow and accepted her role as the necessary sacrifice.{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|288}}
