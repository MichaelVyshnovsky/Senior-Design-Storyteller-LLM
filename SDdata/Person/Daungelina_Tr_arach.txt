'''Daungelina Tr'arach''' was a [[drow]] first priestess in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Daungelina hailed from [[House Tr'arach]] in [[Menzoberranzan]]; it was a small house. Her mother [[Hauzz Tr'arach]] plotted to one day elevate Daungelina to the [[Ruling Council]].

In [[1018 DR]], Daungelina together with Matron Mother Hauzz and her brother [[Duvon Tr'arach]] planned an attack on [[House Simfray]]. The first priestess 
reassured Hauzz about the wizards they had hired from [[House Xorlarrin]] and Duvon 
about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master [[Zaknafein]].

During the attack, Daungelina and Duvon confronted Zaknafein but the enemy weapon master easily defeated Duvon and later, with a few quick actions, also killed Daungelina.
