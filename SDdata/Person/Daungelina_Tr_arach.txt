Daungelina Trarach was a drow first priestess in the early 11 century DR.
Daungelina hailed from House Trarach in Menzoberranzan it was a small house. Her mother Hauzz Trarach plotted to one day elevate Daungelina to the Ruling Council.
In 1018 DR, Daungelina together with Matron Mother Hauzz and her brother Duvon Trarach planned an attack on House Simfray. The first priestess 
reassured Hauzz about the wizards they had hired from House Xorlarrin and Duvon 
about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master Zaknafein.
During the attack, Daungelina and Duvon confronted Zaknafein but the enemy weapon master easily defeated Duvon and later, with a few quick actions, also killed Daungelina.
