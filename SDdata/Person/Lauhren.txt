Lauhren was a priestess of Lliira inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Lauhren spent her entire young life within Waterdeep and longed to experience the adventure of the open road.
She owned a rope of entanglement and some bracers of defense. These items were gifts from a friend who wanted to encourage Lliiras faith in Lauhren.
She was in love with a young man named Jan Hunabar.
