        "mainbody": "'''Ingrid Liansdottir''', also known as the '''Keeper of the Mysteries and the Wyrd''', was a [[drow]] [[proxy]] of the [[Dark Seldarine]] [[power]] known as [[Eilistraee]] and a member of the [[Sign of One]].",
        "Personality": "Ingrid had a seductive voice, as seductive as the voice of a [[sirine]], and a shining heart nature.",
        "Abilities": "A unique power possessed by Ingrid was that she could make any [[curse]] she made come true. And whenever she sang, it could bewitch even the most cold hearted of individuals.",
        "Activities": "Ingrid spent her days living in the [[Ysgard]] layer of [[Svartalfheim]], in the realm's center of shrines Yggwyrd. Among the people of that community, she was considered to be a person of import. She largely kept to herself, ignoring most requests for audiences and tending to the relatively empty city of Yggwyrd with great devotion."
