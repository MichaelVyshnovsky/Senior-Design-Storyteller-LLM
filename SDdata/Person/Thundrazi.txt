'''Thundrazi''' ({{Pronounce|THOON|draw|zee|refs={{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|40}}}}) was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] and a [[Harper]] spy in [[Mulmaster]].

==Personality==
Thundrazi usually spoke only in brief and curt sentences. She had a soft side for the young of all species. She tried to maintain her cover, but in case of danger to children, she did not care if she was exposed.

==Relationships==
Thundrazi worked with the [[Hawks]], the secret police of Mulmaster, and infiltrated the local embassy of [[Thay]]. 

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], she was at [[Astrid Saj]]'s estate during an uprising by [[Elemental Evil]] cultists, so Mistress Saj provided her with an adventuring party as an escort to return to the embassy.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|36}}
