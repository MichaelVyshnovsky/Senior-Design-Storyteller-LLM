'''Hopper''' was one of six [[horse]]s kept by a group of travelers that lived in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
{{Quote|Not mercy, sacrifice. Sacrifice. Good sir say sacrifice. Good sir not ask Hopper.|The goblin [[Sheemzher]], regarding Hopper's fate.}}

The older horse had cracked a hoof some time before he and his [[human]]s, the [[mage]] [[Druhallen]], [[Galimer]], [[Rozt'a]], and [[Tiep]], arrived at [[Parnast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. That year, he and five other horses, including [[Bandy]], [[Cardinal (horse)|Cardinal]], [[Ebony (horse)|Ebony]], [[Fowler (horse)|Fowler]], and [[Star (horse)|Star]], accompanied the party, until the young lad was forced to simply lead the old horse.

During the journey Hopper's injured hoof got worse, and it became apparent he would not endure the full trip through the mountains and back again. Understanding that Hopper would die regardless the circumstances, Druhallen and the others decided to sacrifice the gelding to appease a tribe of [[Dekanter goblin]]s and help ensure safe passage through the mines. Druhallen conjured fire within Hopper's brain to ensure a quick death, and let the goblins feast on his remains.
