'''Thallastam''' was a [[Chondathan]] [[human]] man of [[the Vast]] of the 6th century [[DR]]. He was a famous expert in magical swords, a practitioner of the [[Sublime Way]], and a [[Jade Phoenix mage]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades|}}

==History==
Thallastam hailed from the city of [[Procampur]] in the Vast. In his youth, he visited [[Kara-Tur]] and studied there for a while before returning to his homeland.

There, he founded the [[Nine Swords Company]], consisting of ten [[blade magic]]ians: four [[crusader]]s; five [[Warblade (blade magic)|warblades]]; and himself, a [[swordsage]]. They adventured through the Vast, performing good deeds and slaying dangerous monsters. When they eventually disbanded, Thallastam concealed his companions' nine [[sword]]s in [[Swords Pool (pool)|Swords Pool]] using a spell he'd cast,{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades|}} to protect and preserve them.

He returned to Procampur and became a famous sage, specializing in magical swords and amassing a collection of blades. Therefore, a peddler from a neighboring town sold Thallastam a certain unidentified sword for 1500 [[gold piece]]s. In the [[550 DR|Year of the Zealous, 550 DR]], Thallastam set out and took the blade to a fellow sage and expert in swords, and the only person that he could trust with his find, [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]]. Elminster identified the blade as [[Ilbratha|''Ilbratha'', the "Mistress of Battles"]], the legendary lost sword of King [[Azoun I]] of [[Cormyr]].

Thallastam left Shadowdale to return to Procampur with ''Ilbratha'', traveling via [[Tilver's Gap]] and [[Essembra]] in [[Battledale]]. But he disappeared on the way, never reaching Procampur and not seen alive again. Several years later, Battledale's [[Pool of Yeven]] was dragged and turned up a skeleton and Thallastam's staff and ruined diary, though ''Ilbratha'' could not be found.The background to the Jade Phoenix Mage [[prestige class]] in ''[[Tome of Battle]]'' describes them as endlessly reincarnated guardians of an imprisoned evil force (with [[Dendar the Night Serpent]] suggested). However, this does not appear in the Realms in "[[Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades]]", with Jade Phoenix Mages simply described as a kind of battle-mage. Therefore, Thallastam was likely not reincarnated.

===Legacy===
Several pieces from Thallastam's blade collection were never found, and by [[1358 DR]] these were rumored to still be hidden in Procampur. His spell at Swords Pool outlived him and his companions, and still preserved their nine swords by [[1370 DR]]. His Nine Swords Company was later reformed in the 1370s DR at [[Swords Pool (village)|Swords Pool]].

==Abilities==
Thallastam was a [[wizard]] and a [[swordsage]] practitioner of the [[Sublime Way]], who in his life attained the full powers of a [[Jade Phoenix mage]]. He preferred unarmed combat but was also a sage and an expert in magical swords.
