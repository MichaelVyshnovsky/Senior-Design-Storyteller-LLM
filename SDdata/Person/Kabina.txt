{{Quote|Bitter or not, it was an oasis, and it is a blasphemy to foul it. They shall pay for this atrocity with their blood.|On the use of [[poison]] by the Zhentarim.}}

==Description==
Kabina was a brawny man.

==Personality==
He was a superstitious man that believed spending time around [[spellcaster]]s would displease the gods.

==Relationships==

Although he fought alongside them during the conflicts against the Zhentarim, Kabina was extremely weary of the [[sorceress]] [[Ruha]] and the foreign member of the [[Harpers]] called [[Lander]].

==History==
Kabina was present at the important meetings between the sheikhs of the Bedine tribes leading up to the [[Battle of the Fissures]], which took place in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.
