The '''Horned Mage''' was a mysterious [[ogre magi]] who briefly emerged in [[Amn]] in [[661 DR]] to lead an army of [[ogre]]s and monsters.

==Possessions==
He was reputed to have had a ''+4 [[mithral shirt]]'', later used by his "successor" [[Sothillis]].

==History==
The Horned Mage came about in a period when the native ogres of Amn had been pushed back into the hills and mountains, reduced to small raids and skirmishes with border garrisons. Prince [[Imnel Torlath I]] led the army of the realm in the [[Ogre Wars]], with his greatest victory at [[Imnel's Scar]]. During this battle, he discovered the [[Armory of Nedeheim]]—a collection of powerful [[giant]]-crafted weapons hidden by the [[dwarves]] of [[High Shanatar]]. He had the collection moved to [[Athkatla]] and then [[Esmeltaran]] for storage in the royal vaults.

The Horned Mage traveled and explored the region over a century later, finding the dwarven journal ''[[Runes of the Wailing Dwarf]]'', and Prince Imnel's personal journal ''[[Imnel's Scar: A Personal History of the Ogre Wars]]''. Using these sources, the Horned Mage determined the likely fate of the Armory of Nedeheim and put together a plan to seize it. Finally in [[661 DR]] he made his move and led several tribes of ogres from the [[Cloud Peaks]] under cover of magic, and unified them with the ogres of the [[Small Teeth]]. With his ogres and other monsters, he suddenly swept down into the lowlands of Amn and sacked [[Imnescar]] and [[Trademeet]]. Before he could lay siege to Esmeltaran, King [[Rashturl Torlath]] assembled his forces and met the ogres in decisive battle, scattering them back to the hills. Of the Horned Mage, no sign was found of his fate.

His legacy was taken up by the ogre magi Sothilis, who found his secret lair in the Small Teeth and discovered his research. Sothilis then sought out the Armory of Nedeheim in the 14{{th}} century, leading ogres and other monsters to war and naming himself the Scion of the Horned Mage—an appellation that his troops approved of.

==Rumors==
Although the Horned Mage vanished with nary a trace, some suspected that he became a [[hooded pupil]] of [[Rysellan]] the Dark of [[Memnon]].
