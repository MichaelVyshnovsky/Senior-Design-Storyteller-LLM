'''Mino''' was a [[druid]] and a member of the [[Emerald Grove]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Those goblins ought never to have found us. They never ''would'' have, if we'd been properly secluded.}}

==Personality==
Mino was averse to risk and not quite as compassionate as some of his fellow druids.

==Relationships==
Aelar served under [[Archdruid]] [[Halsin]], alongside [[Rath]], [[Apikusis]], [[Aelar]], and the link-minded [[Jeorna]].

==History==
When Halsin left the Emerald Grove in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, he placed [[Kagha]] in a role of temporary leadership. Kagha had the druids begin the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'', a ritual that would hide the grove away from outsiders and protect it from [[goblinoid]] raiders associated with the growing [[cult of the Absolute]]. Mino wholly supported this strategy as he felt their isolation from the rest of the [[Sword Coast]] would ensure their continued security.
