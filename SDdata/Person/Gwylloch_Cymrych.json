        "Relationships": "He was a member of the [[Cymrych Dynasty]] and the grandson of the dynastyâ€™s legendary namesake, [[Cymrych Hugh]]. He was the eldest son of his predecessor, High King [[Carrig Cymrych I|Carrig I]]. His successor was his younger brother, [[Gorham Cymrych]].\n\nGwylloch had at least two sons: [[Ketheryll Cymrych|Ketheryll]], the elder son, and [[Markus Cymrych|Markus]], his second son. Markus would go on to become High King after Gorham.",
        "History": "Gwylloch assumed the throne of the High King in the {{YearlinkName|287}}, after his father died in battle against the [[Northmen]]. He continued fighting the Northmen, and was an avid practitioner of a [[Ffolk]] tradition of collecting the severed heads of his enemies. By the {{YearlinkName|289}}, his collection of enemy [[skull]]s had become so vast that he used them to construct a palace for himself: the [[Castle of Skulls]]. He was so impressed with this construction that he relocated his retainers and courtesans to this castle.\n\nOver the next several years, he launched numerous expeditions against the Northmen, collecting more skulls as well as captives to be killed in his \"[[Circus Bizarre]]\" arena. He also warred with any lords of the Ffolk who resisted his authority, and in the {{YearlinkName|295}}, King [[Durnhal]] and Queen [[Morgan (queen)|Morgan]] of [[Corwell]] were accused of treason against him, and were put to death by his son, Prince Ketheryll.\n\nUltimately, Gwylloch and Ketheryll went mad, and on the night of the [[Summer Solstice]] in the [[299 DR|tenth year of Gwylloch's reign]], they and their retainers all perished in a rabid, suicidal orgy of combat within the Castle of Skulls."
