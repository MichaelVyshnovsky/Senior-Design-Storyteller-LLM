        "mainbody": "su Gonsuke was the head of the noble Tsu family and the provincial governor of Miyama Province in Kozakura in 1357 DR.\nThe retired emperor Gokammu gave the governorship of Miyama to the Tsu family, one of the noble families that supported him, and Gonsuke, as head of the house, was chosen as governor. Thank to the income from the province, the Tsu clan prospered. However, Gonsuke never actually ruled Miyama, as he lived most of his life in the capital and the actual governing of the province was handled by the mokudai.\nGonsuke was a gruff man, greatly suffering from arthritis."
