        "mainbody": "'''Tsu Gonsuke''' was the head of the noble [[Tsu family]] and the provincial governor of [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "The retired emperor [[Gokammu]] gave the governorship of Miyama to the [[Tsu family]], one of the noble families that supported him, and Gonsuke, as head of the house, was chosen as governor. Thank to the income from the province, the Tsu clan prospered. However, Gonsuke never actually ruled Miyama, as he lived most of his life in the capital and the actual governing of the province was handled by the [[mokudai]].",
        "Personality": "Gonsuke was a gruff man, greatly suffering from [[arthritis]]."
