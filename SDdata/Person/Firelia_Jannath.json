        "mainbody": "Lady Firelia Wisteria Jannath, or simply Lady Jannath, was a high social status member of the patriar Jannath family of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.This article treats Firelia Wisteria Jannath as a single character, a likely result of the games rewrites. Lady Jannath is described to be middle-aged when inspecting her portrait painted by Oskar Fevras, while in in-game dialogues Enver Gortash is described to be young and handsome (despite his model being middle-aged). A note found in Lady Jannaths vault describes Wisteria Jannaths past affair with Gortash. Lady Jannaths age allows for the said timeline however, it makes it less likely considering Lady Jannaths middle age and, consequently, her mothers advanced age. Lady Jannaths parents are both mentioned in-game but remain unnamed, and their mention is present in the present-time context of Lady Jannaths long-awaited marriage. With Lady Jannaths mother being alive and not inhabiting the same Lower City mansion, it would be a fair assumption that Lady Jannaths personal vault key in her possession contains her own personal and secret possessions, not the possessions of a family member.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Lady Jannath was a beautiful middle-aged woman with hair of autumn red and green eyes. Her light freckled skin showed early signs of aging, but her elegant appearance, fashionable jewelry, and green gowns were enough to highlight the womans attractiveness.\nLady Jannath once shared a romantic entanglement with Lord Enver Gortash. In the years that followed, many men sought her hand in marriage, but the man she ended up marrying was an artist and painter of some renown. Oskar Fevras was courted by Lady Jannath and eventually left another woman for the patriar. Despite rumors and bad faith arguments, Oskar did feel affection for Wisteria, as his paintings of her clearly showed.\nWhen it was believed her husband perished, several men attempted for the Ladys hand and affections Lord Haventh, Jonah, and Horatius, among others.\nWisteria Jannath did not live in the familys Upper City Jannath Estate, instead, she owned a mansion in the Lower City.\nLady Jannath wore an enchanted wedding band – Til Death Do Us Part, that allowed her to cast the beacon of hope spell. She also owned a powerful magic headwear – Jannaths hat, which she kept locked away in the safety of a vast in the Counting House, alongside a diary from her lavender-perfumed love affair.\nLady Jannath was a patron of the arts and hosted art shows at her Lower City estate. One of the upcoming showings as of 1492 DR was \"Strange Tides Self-Portraits from the Sword Coast,\" with patriars from other noble families among the attendees. Smallbites and libations for the event included wild mushroom soup, steak medallions with asparagus, and golden pear pie.\nAt some point before the , Lady Jannath had a brief but passionate affair with Enver Gortash, whose mere hugs made Wisteria feel like a young debutante. In her passion, Wisteria gifted Lord Gortash a priceless diamond ring – a heirloom of House Jannath worth more than her entire mansion.\nEventually, Lady Jannath found a new object of desire. She began mutual courting with the artist Oskar Fevras, who was commissioned to paint her portrait, subsequently wresting his affections from the woman he thought to be the love of his life once. The affair quickly blossomed into a betrothal and marriage. The ceremony was generously financed by Lady Jannaths parents with the High Hall being discussed as one of the venues. When Oskar disappeared on Kythorn 13 of 1492 DR, Lady Jannath at first assumed he was consumed by his art. Eventually, it became quite obvious something had happened. Wisteria asked her butler – dragonborn Tarhun Mnemonis, to discretely ask around about the missing painter. By Kythorn 18, she knew that something had to be done as the painter had been missing for five days. Lady Jannath made a hefty donation to the Flaming Fists to ensure they were aware of the cases urgency. Lastly, she hired the Blue Lynx Adventurers troupe for 1,000 gp with an additional charge of 1,000 gp for incidentals to track the painter down. They returned empty-handed – no trace of Oskar from Baldurs Gate to Waterdeep. The truth of the matter was Oskar left the city for the open air of the countryside to clear his mind after the scandal broke out in the Gate over the news of Oskars affair and marriage to Lady Jannath.\nUnfortunately, with news of Oskars exploits out, he made a ripe target for blackmailers and other criminals. He was abducted by a Zhentarim slaver named Brem and taken to the Zhentarim hideout underneath the Waukeens Rest inn. One way or another, Oskar ended up escaping slavery, either with help from a group of adventurers known as the Absolute Adversaries or with some desperate gull.\nHowever, after his return, the painter started losing appetite, getting depressed, and eventually was revealed to be possessed by the spirit of his other love – Kerri Evenfield, who took her own life after being left by Oskar. The possessed painter flooded Lady Jannaths Estate with cursed apparitions and ghosts, scaring away guests and servants. Lady Jannath remained with the belligerent possessed artist and tried to break through to her husband. Unbeknownst to all but the painter, the source of possession was the portrait of Kerri, Oskar hid in his studio in the mansions attic. Tormented by guilt Oskar hired Mystic Carrion to seek forgiveness from his dead love, but enraged and undead Kerri had different plans. On an order from Oskar, Mystic Carrion also procured a rare magic item – a torch of revocation, the only thing that could destroy the painting that tethered vengeful Kerri Evenfield to the Prime Material plane. The painting may had been destroyed by the Absolute Adversaries, earning them Lady Jannaths gratitude."
