Sultan Yusef bin Ahmad al-Wadi, also called Yusef the Just, was the ruler of Gana in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
Yusefs wisdom and knowledge with regard to the law earned him his nickname "Yusef the Just."
Yusef discouraged any one individual from holding power for too long, resulting in a relatively steady influx of talented individuals passing through the court of Gana.
The sultan never married but did keep an active harim. He had several children but did not formally recognized any of them which seemed disrespectful to some Ganites.
The sultan was rumored to have once proposed marriage to his Chief Vizier Alia bint Hazir.
