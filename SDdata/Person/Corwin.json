        "mainbody": "orwin was a cook employed by Gustaf Stellern in his hunting lodge in Neverwinter Wood during the late 15 century DR.\nIn the late 15th century DR, Corwin was an aged man who was disenchanted because of his life experiences. He lived in a simply furnished bedroom on the upper level of the stable house.\nCorwins employer, Gustaf Stellern, liked to hunt orcs and turn their heads into trophies. Corwin warned him that this could provoke a retaliatory attack and he was proved right. Following the appearance of the white dragon Cryovain in the region, the orcs formed an alliance with a half-orc cult of Talos and attacked the hunting lodge. The anchorites of Talos also conjured Gorthok the Thunder Boar to aid the attack."
