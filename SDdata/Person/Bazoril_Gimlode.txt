Bazoril Gimlode was a dwarven merchant that operated on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
Bazoril sold a variety of goods including potions of healing and rejuvenation, medical supplies, and various kits that allowed adventurers to better utilize their skills out in the world.
In the , Bazoril and his caravan were traveling along the High Road near Raven Cliff Beach when they were ambushed by Blackdagger Bandits. While the caravan was halted the group managed to make camp, receiving stalwart protection from "Dusty" Yates, the sergeant of the caravan guard. They remained pinned down without supplies for a time, unable to send runners for aid due to the tracking skills of the Blackdagger gnoll trackers. Fortunately, Melkhor Goldseeker sought aid from a local adventurer that worked with Sergeant Yates to reverse their fates.
