        "mainbody": "'''Tha''' was one of the [[phaerimm]]s that dwelled behind the [[Sharn Wall]] beneath the [[Greycloak Hills]] for over a thousand years, before being released from imprisonment in the early days of the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]] saga.",
        "Personality": "Like the rest of the WarGather, Tha was contentious with the other phaerimm. It was against the nature of the phaerimm to remain in such close proximity to others of its kind for an extended period of time.",
        "History": "After being released in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Tha and the other phaerimm in the Greycloak Hills WarGather captured a group of Evereskan elves that ventured underground to repair the breach in the Sharn Wall. Along with [[Zay]], Tha demeaned and tortured the elves in order to break into [[Evereska]] and consume its ''[[mythal]]'', killing many of them in the process.\n\nSoon after, a mixed band of [[human]] and elves led by [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] ventured into the phaerimm's lair to rescue the captives. The elven warrior [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] killed Tha by slicing its face open at the jaw with one of the [[Vaasa]]n ''[[darksword]]''s."
