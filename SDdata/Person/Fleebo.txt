Fleebo was a bandit who preyed upon the Trade Way north of Zazesspur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Fleebo was among the bravest of his companions&mdashor perhaps the most foolish.
The bandit possessed a shortbow and rode on horseback.
In the spring of the , Fleebo was a member of a band of robbers who happened to stop an extended family of foresters from Tethir led by a man named Wyancott. While the leader of the bandits questioned Wyancott, Star Protective Services arrived to rescue them. When he stood atop a wagon and aimed his weapon at Zaranda Star, Fleebo was shot dead by an arrow through his forehead from Vander Stillhawk. Zaranda then used his dead body in a failed attempt to teach her ward Chenowyn about death.
