        "mainbody": "'''Ariskrit Darowdryn''' was the matriarch of the noble [[House Darowdryn]], one of the oldest and wealthiest merchant families of [[Arrabar]] and all of [[Chondath]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Hetta has been my friend and confidante for many years, and though I don't know if she can hear me or not, you assure her that we are going to help you set things right. That whelp [[Talricci]] will not get away with this, I promise you.''|Ariskrit Darowdryn to Emriana Matrell}}",
        "Description": "By [[1373 DR]], Ariskrit was a matronly woman, almost as old as her good friend, [[Hetta Matrell]].",
        "Relationships": "Ariskrit was old friends with the fellow noble family matriarch Hetta Matrell of the [[House Matrell]]. The women were often seen socializing during events of the Arrabarran nobility and visited each other at their families' estates.\n\nAriskrit was often accompanied and protected by her nephew [[Tharlgarl Darowdryn|Tharlgarl \"Steelfists\" Darowdryn]].",
        "History": "On [[Tarsakh 10]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Ariskrit Darowdryn and Tharlgarl \"Steelfists\" attended Emriana Matrell's grand celebration of becoming an adult, an Arrabarran tradition for a woman's 16{{th}} birthday. During the celebration, Ariskrit witnessed an assassination attempt on her friend Hetta's life orchestrated by the cabal of [[Talricci]]s, [[Pharaboldi]]s, and, as later revealed, Hetta's own family, as retaliation for the matriarch's disapproval of the sneak coin activities. Later, Ariskrit aided young Emriana after her grandmother's spirit was trapped in a magic [[ring]], another sinister ploy by the Talriccis."
