'''Carlig''' was a [[duergar]] trader in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
Carlig set up a duergar trading encampment, along with [[Finderlig]] and [[Uder Mordin]], near the underground entrance to [[Spellhold]]. He reported to [[Gorion's Ward]] that he had recently seen [[Jon Irenicus]] and [[Bodhi]] travel through the Underdark towards a city called [[Ust Natha]].

Despite being typically xenophobic to surface dwellers, he was more than eager to trade with them. Carlig sold an array of spells and equipment. He considered himself a simple trader, and did not wish to get involved in matters concerning the [[drow]]. Despite this, he would only sell his special goods to races native to the Underdark.
