'''Emerash''' was an [[Dragon aging|adult]] [[green dragon]] who lived in in a cavern, deep in the forests of [[Shadowdale]] in [[1369 DR]]. The dragon was protective of the treasure in his cave.

Like all green dragons, Emerash had a breath of corrosive chlorine gas. The dragon's roar could cause fear in anyone within earshot.
