Veira was the ghostly namesake of the Weeping Widow Inn in Targos who lived sometime before the early 14 century DR.
Veira was a living woman many years before the early 14 century DR. She was madly in love with her paramour â€“ a sailor named Donovan. One night during a deadly storm that passed the great Maer Dualdon, Donovan disappeared, leaving Veira alone and heartbroken. She hurled herself out of the window to the base of the cliff. Since then, the window has been attempted to be repaired, but eventually, the room was left untouched just as the grieving woman had left it. The lake-facing room remained locked and unused, with Veiras ghost appearing and weeping in the deepest nights.
The Weeping Widow Inns innkeeper, Cahl-Hyred, paid for a protective glyph to be inscribed on the rooms door to contain the restless spirit to a single room and keep her from bothering the inns guests.
Veiras ghost remained in the room at least until the . If anyone were brave enough to talk to the spirit, she would refuse to talk to anyone but her long-lost Donovan, who promised to return to his beloved. Her entire existence was consumed by grief and hopeless stares into the broken window, waiting for Donovans boat to make it back to the harbor.
Some said that the spirit found rest in 1312 DR, soon after a group of adventurers from Luskan held off a goblin invasion of Targos. The group found broken carved prow from the skiff called Veiras Gaze. The ghosts parting words were that she would see the heroes again someday in a land far away.
