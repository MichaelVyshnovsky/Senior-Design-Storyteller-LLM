'''Veira''' was the [[ghost]]ly namesake of the [[Weeping Widow Inn]] in [[Targos]] who lived sometime before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I heard a spirit weeping in the inn, yes, in the room with the window, the window that was broken long ago. If I had a poetical bent, when night falls, she rises like the tide, and the tears flow from her wounded heart. But because I detest poetry, I will simply say that ghosts, more than other spirits, are a... tiresome bunch. They tend to... '''dwell''' on things, yes, and howl on about it, like [[dog]]s outside your window when you are trying to sleep. So did I leave the inn? Of course.''|[[Koluhm Bonecutter]] of [[Myrkul]]}}

==History==
Veira was a living woman many years before the early 14{{th}} century DR. She was madly in love with her paramour â€“ a sailor named [[Donovan]]. One night during a deadly storm that passed the great [[Maer Dualdon]], Donovan disappeared, leaving Veira alone and heartbroken. She hurled herself out of the window to the base of the cliff. Since then, the window has been attempted to be repaired, but eventually, the room was left untouched just as the grieving woman had left it. The lake-facing room remained locked and unused, with Veira's ghost appearing and weeping in the deepest nights.

The Weeping Widow Inn's innkeeper, [[Cahl-Hyred]], paid for a protective ''glyph'' to be inscribed on the room's door to contain the restless spirit to a single room and keep her from bothering the inn's guests.

Veira's ghost remained in the room at least until the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. If anyone were brave enough to talk to the spirit, she would refuse to talk to anyone but her long-lost Donovan, who promised to return to his beloved. Her entire existence was consumed by grief and hopeless stares into the broken window, waiting for Donovan's boat to make it back to the harbor.

Some said that the spirit found rest in 1312 DR, soon after a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]] held off a [[goblin]] invasion of Targos. The group found broken carved prow from the [[skiff]] called ''[[Veira's Gaze]]''. The ghost's parting words were that she would see the heroes again someday in a land far away.
