'''Mikal Canos''' was the [[Tharchion]] of [[Delhumide]] in [[Thay]] in [[1357 DR]] and brother of fellow tharchion [[Thessaloni Canos]].

==History==
Mikal commanded one of the most largest thayan army in order to keep control of the ruins of the ancient Delhumide and mean time suppress the many slave uprising in the slave-farms in his Tharch and the sometime raids from [[Rashemen]] warriors. With the [[Salamender's War]] most of his troops were relocated in the battlefields and he had now very few soldiers.


While investigating rumors of a powerful artifact in Delhumide five years ago, Mikal disappeared and has since been presumed dead.

The new tharchion of Delhumide, Invarri Metran, is less interested in treasure hunting. He has given himself over to administration of the region's slave farms and to strengthening the border against occasional Rashemi invaders. A relatively young tharchion from a relatively young family, Invarri realizes the troubles that Thay's divided government has caused and is a supporter of Szass Tam's attempts at unification.<ref>TSR1121 Spellbound page 11
