'''General Clas Denwith''' was a belligerent [[priest]] of [[Tempus]] in the city of [[Ormpetarr]], in [[Sespech]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

As the nations of Sespech and [[Chondath]] were constantly on the brink of war with one another around the year [[1370 DR]], General Denwith was often found giving speeches denouncing the their neighbors to the east. He proclaimed the ruling family of [[Arrabar]] as decadent and corrupt, stressing their military was non match for the forces of Sespech under the will of Tempus.

==Personality==
Although he was an earnest priest who was devoted to the God of Battle, General Denwith was a pretty excitable and could get whipped up into something of a frenzy.

==Possessions==
Fitting to his standing as a leader in the [[church of Tempus]], he possessed a pair of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' and wore a ''[[ring of the ram]]''.
