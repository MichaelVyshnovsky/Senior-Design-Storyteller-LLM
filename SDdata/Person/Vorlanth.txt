'''Vorlanth''' was a [[Warlock Knights#Ranks|Fellthane]] among the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]], and controlled a domain that included the [[Delhalls]] mine in western [[Vaasa]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|5}}

==Description==
He was an impassive man who wore ''[[ironfell]]'' [[plate armor]] and concealed his face beneath a [[helmet]], except when speaking to someone.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|32}} As a Knight-Fellthane, he held absolute power over his own fiefdom and maintained his own standing army.

==Personality==
He was evil and scheming, and therefore did not trust anyone.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|5}} He tended to assume that [[adventurer]]s were either spies for his enemies{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|21}}

==Activities==
While he swore fealty to the [[Ironfell Council]], Vorlanth's true loyalties lay with a secret [[Banite]] faction within the Warlock Knights, and he worked to form an alliance with the fellow Banite [[Council of Blades]] in [[Mulmaster]] while trying to avoid attracting the attention of his superiors.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|7}}

==Relationships==
His retinue included a force of heavily-armored soldiers, several [[nishaadhri]] [[warlock]]s, and a [[cleric]] of Bane.

He was served by [[Omog]], the foreman of the Delhalls, who drove the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[slave]]s who worked the mines.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|8}}

He had a rivalry with [[Angath]], a fellow Warlock Knight of a lower rank. Vorlanth regarded Angath as a fool, and had warned him to stay out of his dealings.

==History==
During the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, an earthquake struck Vorlanth's domain and collapsed the entrance to the Delhalls mines. He quickly called for his slaves to reopen the mine, but when they did, they discovered new passages containing strange crystals and a haunting, alluring song. This discovery greatly excited Vorlanth, who began to research the strange phenomenon. He quickly determined that the song was in fact a prayer to [[Auril]], and he additionally found ancient texts detailing the vault beneath the mines and that the Ice Queen [[Iyraclea]] had hid something within. While he was able to learn everything necessary to find and open the vault, he was not able to determine what exactly was inside it: he presumed it was some manner of powerful [[artifact]] that might allow him to control the monsters and [[undead]] of the [[Great Glacier]].

After sending word to the Council of Blades&mdash;hoping that the promise of acquiring a powerful artifact would help to solidify an alliance&mdash;Vorlanth recruited a group of evil mercenaries to enter the Delhalls and acquire it. This group was led by [[Lysara]], a [[priest]]ess of Auril, and included the [[rogue]] [[Kallista]], the [[warlock]] [[Kathra]], the [[ranger]] [[Quarfein]], and the [[warlord]] [[Bharash (Vaasa)|Bharash]]. However, Vorlanth feared that these adventurers planned to betray him, and so he gave each member only partial instructions for how to reach and enter the vault, thus ensuring that none of them could individually betray him.

Within a few [[tenday]]s, the mercenaries had entered and vanished within the Delhalls. Around the same time, a Banite entourage from the [[Moonsea]] heeded Vorlanth's invitation and arrived in Vaasa.
