'''Derrick Gaffner''' was a sailor in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1485 DR]].

==History==
Derrick was a fisherman in [[Lac Dinneshere]] and captain of the fishing boat ''[[Howling Fiend]]'' until he found some [[black ice]]. The evil ice corrupted Derrick so that he turned to piracy.

He was so effective that his pirate gang grew large, attracting the interest of [[Vaelish Gant]]. His crew attacked and raided [[Caer-Konig]] and [[Caer-Dineval]] in rapid succession. Soon after, they targeted [[Easthaven]]. Around this time, however, an adventuring party defeated him.
