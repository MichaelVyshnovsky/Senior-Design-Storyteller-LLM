{{Quote|Now then, allow me to take a small sampling from your tunic to test for magical residue...|Matrikay, to her friend Delina.}}

==Personality==

==Abilities==
As a powerful wizard, Matrikay was capable of casting powerful spells, including among others ''[[Mordenkainen's private sanctum|private sanctum]]''.

==Activities==
Matrikay specialized in the study of "eldritch lore", and spent much of her time researching [[wild magic]].

==Relationships==
[[File:Delina, Martikay EBG.png|thumb|right|300px|''Matrikay, saying farewell to her friend [[Delina]] at [[Knowledge-Hold]].'']]
She was a friend of [[Delina]] a [[wild mage]] sorceress from Baldur's Gate who went on to have a prolific adventuring career. Matrikay and Delina worked together to better understand [[wild surge]]s. They hoped to help Delina exert some manner of control over them, in order to make her less unpredictable [[spellcaster]].

==History==
When Matrikay learned information about a place of "absolute order"―the plane of [[Mechanus]]―she used powerful magic to transport Delina there, with the hopes she could find a solution to her dangerous wild surges.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|19-20}}

Some time in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Matrikay got into a series of heated disagreements with Knowledge-Hold's head librarian, [[Hayley Kroe]]. Kroe had been acting in bizarre ways over the course of a few days, and Matrikay suspected she was destroying unique, and seemingly irreplaceable documents. When Matrikay brought her concerns to Delina, the wild mage and her [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate|fellow adventurers]] agreed to investigate Knowledge-Hold.{{Cite comic/Mindbreaker 1|7-8}} They discovered that Hayley Kroe had joined some [[Cult of the Absolute|mysterious cult]], and that the Knowledge-Hold had been infiltrated by devotees of some entity known as [[the Absolute]].{{Cite comic/Mindbreaker 1|16-20}}
