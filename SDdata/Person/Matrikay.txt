Matrikay was a wizard-librarian as well as the proprietor of the Knowledge-Hold in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
She held the preservation and sanctity of knowledge in the highest regard. While she would not necessarily put a friend in harms way to learn more about the magical world, Matrikay would not turn down the opportunity if they happened to already escaped from peril.
As a powerful wizard, Matrikay was capable of casting powerful spells, including among others private sanctum.
Matrikay specialized in the study of "eldritch lore", and spent much of her time researching wild magic.

She was a friend of Delina a wild mage sorceress from Baldurs Gate who went on to have a prolific adventuring career. Matrikay and Delina worked together to better understand wild surges. They hoped to help Delina exert some manner of control over them, in order to make her less unpredictable spellcaster.
When Matrikay learned information about a place of "absolute order"―the plane of Mechanus―she used powerful magic to transport Delina there, with the hopes she could find a solution to her dangerous wild surges.
Some time in the , Matrikay got into a series of heated disagreements with Knowledge-Holds head librarian, Hayley Kroe. Kroe had been acting in bizarre ways over the course of a few days, and Matrikay suspected she was destroying unique, and seemingly irreplaceable documents. When Matrikay brought her concerns to Delina, the wild mage and her fellow adventurers agreed to investigate Knowledge-Hold. They discovered that Hayley Kroe had joined some mysterious cult, and that the Knowledge-Hold had been infiltrated by devotees of some entity known as the Absolute.
