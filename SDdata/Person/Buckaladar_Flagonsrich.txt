Buckaladar Flagonsrich, or Buck Flagonsrich, was the Guildmaster of the Distillers Guild in Purskul of Amn in the late 14 century DR.
Buckaladar was a haughty snob of a halfling, a winemaker of great skill, pallet, and terrible temper. With a single sip of wine, the halfling could identify the grape used in the wines pressing, vintage year, and country of origin.
The Flagonsrich family, along with several other notable hin clans, owned most of Purskul. Bucks home stood along the Orc Road in the Zehoarastria region of Amn. The Flagonsrich Estate included a great garden and vineyards in the back.
In the , before the Feast of the Moon, the Knights of the Shield worked on restoring Amns monarchy, manipulated by Rhinnom Dannihyr, the Grandmaster of the Shadow Thieves. Buckaladar Flagonsrich was a strong supporter of the agenda and led to Bucks nomination to the Knights of the Shield.
