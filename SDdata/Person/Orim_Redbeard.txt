'''Orim Redbeard''' was an infamous pirate captain of the ''[[Black Dragon(ship)|Black Dragon]]'' from [[Konigheim]] in the [[Utter East]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Orim was a giant, fat, heavily muscled [[human]] with a red beard, hence his nickname.

==Personality==
Orim was confident in his skills and had a cruel side. 

==Relationships==
Orim hated the ''[[Kissing Shark]]'' and its captain, [[Blackfingers Ralingor]], and his navigator [[Drethil]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, and his crew managed to the destroy the ''Kissing Shark'' in a blast of [[smoke powder]] near the [[Tenteeth Point]] thanks to his hired sorcerer. However, when he heard that some of the surviving Sharkers boarded the ''[[Morning Bird]]'', he and his crew hunted that ship in order to find if his hated enemies had survived. Orim's ship attacked the ''Morning Bird'' but after [[Belmer Droon]] almost managed to kill the mage, Orim asked to parley. However, [[Kurthe Lornar]], still loyal to his old captain, tried to attack Orim, but [[Belgin Dree]] managed to stop Kurthe. Orim Redbeard realized that he pursued the wrong ship, and left the Sharkers in peace.
