        "mainbody": "Selvard Haeleophar was the Master Shipbuilder of Telflamm in Thesk in the late 15 century DR.\nSelvard was a good-looking womanizing man of a capricious personality but a brilliant mind.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Selvard Haeleophar was known for his ships and legendary feuds and tirades. He built naval vessels encased in armor plating, fitted with rams, and elevated ballistae decks. His coastal rakers were equipped with both oars and sails. Each vessel could be assembled in as little as twelve days, but twenty-one days was the average. Selvards shipbuilders occupied six drydocks in Telflamm. Selvard Haeleophars major business rival was Vellard Sisters Shipwright of Tsurlagol."
