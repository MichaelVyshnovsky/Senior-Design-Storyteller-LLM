        "mainbody": "'''Nym Nindar''', nicknamed '''\"Slowtooth\"''', was a [[Chondathan]] [[human]] man living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He owned and operated [[Slowtooth Weaponry]].",
        "History": "Nym Nindar was once an officer in the [[Purple Dragons]], before he retired.\n\nHe was running his weapons shop by [[1358 DR]], and was still in business through [[1369 DR]] and in [[1374 DR]]. He was an old man in 1369 DR.",
        "Activities": "Apart from running Slowtooth Weaponry, and when not otherwise busy, Nindar had a side-business instructing other warriors and young folk in how to wield specific weapons, and in their proper maintenance. His store was popular with [[mercenary|mercenaries]], [[adventurer]]s, and perhaps even [[brigand]]s, who often hung around to watch Nindar train his students. They often shared tales of their exploits, and drank Nindar's mulled [[cider]].",
        "Abilities": "Nindar was skilled with many kinds of weapons and could teach them all, though his specialty was the throwing axe. He made axe-throwing his personal sport. He particularly enjoyed demonstrating how a \"biter\" could go through a design of [[light shield]] commonly used around the [[Inner Sea]].\n\nIn Slowtooth Weaponry, he had cords under his desk with which he could open shutters in the windows and door from a distance. Thus, he could bury an axe in a thief anywhere in or outside his store.",
        "Relationships": "Nindar had five sons, who ran the store while he taught students.",
