'''Tauran''' was an [[astral deva]] in service to [[Tyr]] until his faith was shaken in the events leading up to the death of [[Mystra]]. He was the mentor of the [[half-drow]] knight [[Kael]].

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Tauran was assigned to capture the [[alu-fiend]] [[Aliisza]], whose unborn child ([[Kael]]) had cried out to [[Tyr]] for justice. Soon after, he and [[Micus]] captured [[Kashada]] the Nightwraith and imprisoned her in a sphere of eternal life.

After Kael's birth, Tauran became his mentor.

When the [[Cyric]]ist [[Zasian Menz]] infiltrated the [[House of the Triad]], Tauran made an agreement with [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and Aliisza to hunt him down. However, they were unable to stop him from stealing [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]] with the help of the freed Kashada/[[Shar]] and using it to kill [[Mystra]]. During this time, Tauran began doubting Tyr's judgement and his own faith in the gods, becoming a fallen angel.

Not long after the death of Mystra, Tauran was protecting the [[Lifespring]] when he was killed by Vhok, who had betrayed the House of the Triad to a legion of demons.
