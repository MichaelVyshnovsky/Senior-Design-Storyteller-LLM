'''Narthund Delzhour''' was a [[sage]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Narthund's areas of expertise included [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], geology, and mineralogy. His services were quite cheap and at least half of his fees were paid in [[ale]] at his favorite [[tavern]]â€”the [[Elfstone Tavern]]. However, given his excessive taste for ale, Narthund was only coherent in the early evening.
