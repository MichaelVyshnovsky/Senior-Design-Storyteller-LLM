Queen Grabstab was the ruler of the Biting Ant goblins of Yellyark as of the late 15 century DR.
Queen Grabstab had four adult children who served as her personal aides.
Grabstab wore the bronze and adamantine control amulet linked to the shield guardian Vorn. She was unaware that the amulet was in any way related to Vorn, which she and the other goblins worshiped as a minor deity.
