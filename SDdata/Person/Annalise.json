        "mainbody": "'''Annalise''' was a young tavern wench at the [[Bubbling Bulwark]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "Annalise was regarded as very pretty, and had bright red hair.",
        "Relationships": "Annalise carried on a semi-secret relationship with Lord [[Partic Thistle]], whom she loved dearly. The greatest impediment to their eventual marriage was the high-society scandal that would come from a noble marrying a common barmaid.\n\nAnnalise was best friends with her fellow wench [[Crystyn]], and was on good terms with the other staff of the Bulwark.\n\nThe dashing young [[adventurer]] [[Garit Strongarm]] wished to have a relationship with her, but his possessive jealousy, cruel disposition, and fierce temper ruined any chances he might have had.\n\nAnnalise had something of a rival in the maid [[Tami]], who tried to court Lord Thistle herself, to no effect.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, she had the traumatic experiences of having threats made against her by Garit Strongarm, and believing her beloved Partic had been murdered."
