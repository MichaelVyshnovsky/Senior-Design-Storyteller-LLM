The greatest impediment to their eventual marriage was the high-society scandal that would come from a noble marrying a common barmaid.\nAnnalise was best friends with her fellow wench Crystyn, and was on good terms with the other staff of the Bulwark.\nThe dashing young adventurer Garit Strongarm wished to have a relationship with her, but his possessive jealousy, cruel disposition, and fierce temper ruined any chances he might have had.\nAnnalise had something of a rival in the maid Tami, who tried to court Lord Thistle herself, to no effect.\nIn the , she had the traumatic experiences of having threats made against her by Garit Strongarm, and believing her beloved Partic had been murdered."
