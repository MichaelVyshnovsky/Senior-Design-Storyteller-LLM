        "History": "Othglas was a fat, jolly, and food-loving man, with a penchant for poisoning his enemies. In the Warring Princes' fighting, when the [[magelord]]s targeted him, Othglas escaped to [[Dalniir]] and joined the ranks of [[Malar]]'s clerics.\n\nHowever, the magelords turned him into a [[boar]] during a hunt, and he was slain by his own men in [[220 DR]]."
