        "History": "Warlord of Turmish, Sjorn Sendreth left his mark on the history of [[Faerûn]] by starting a war with the prosperous dwarven city of the Ironfang Deep in the [[Mountains of the Alaoreum]]. The assault on Ironfang took place in the {{YearlinkName|1220}}, fueled by Sjorn Sendreth's greed and desire to claim Ironfang's stockpiles of [[gold]] and arms. The was eventually started exhausting Turmite coffers, forcing Sjorn Sendreth to send \"treasure-parties\" to search for gold to continue fueling the Turmish War of 1220. One of these expeditions would end up dooming the warlord. Sendreth's military campaign against the well-defense drawdown fortress lasted for the next twenty years until the {{YearlinkName|1241}}. Tired of injustice conflict, Ironfang elected to collapse a mountain onto the entrance into the subterranean city, effectively removing themselves from the conflict.\n\nIronfang did not achieve piece however. Shortly after the War of 1220, they entered the prolonged conflict with the [[duergar]] invaders. The following war became known as the [[Campaign of Darkness]].\n\nAfter Ironfang made itself inaccessible, in the {{YearlinkName|1242}}, a group of treasurers returned to [[Alaghôn]] bearing booty stolen from a powerful [[blue dragon]] [[Anaglathos]]. The cunning wyrm decided to ''[[polymorph]]'' into a [[wolf]] companion of the treasurers' [[ranger]] guide and traveled with the band to Alaghôn. The group – the [[Company of the Sabred Tooth]], were invited for an audience with the lord of Turmish, where Sjorn Sendreth was killed by the blue dragon. Anaglathos took the seat of power in Turmish, starting the period of history known as the [[Reign of the Wyrm]]."
