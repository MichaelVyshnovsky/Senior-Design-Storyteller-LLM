[[File:Companions.png|thumb|right|350px|Xander (far right) and his friends beginning their adventuring career.]]
While on a sailing ship ''en route'' to Mintarn, Xander, Helene and Aiden met other future companions. They befriended the twins [[Karrin]] and [[Kerrin]], along with the [[dragonborn]] known as [[Rayonde]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|14}} Together the group joined the White Sails company, eventually joining the crew of Captain [[Nycto]] aboard the ''[[Hesperornis]]''.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|1-4}}

Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Hesperornis'' took on several passengers including the wizened sage [[Shandeir]] ''en route'' for [[Elturel]]. Just as the ship docked at the isle of Mintarn it was destroyed by the [[red dragon]] [[Hoondarrh]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|11-14}} Xander and his friends helped the island's residents get to safety, along with their dear Helene. Xander warned Helene against traveling back to their home on Norland, and was right to do so as it was been devastated as well.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|3-8}}

Xander continued with a life at seas, joining the crew of a ship captained by Aiden. One day while docked at [[Caer Moray]] on the isle of [[Moray]], the crew was enlisted to help defend the nearby [[moonwell]] from [[lycanthrope]]s of the [[Black Blood tribe]]. Xander was slashed across the face by one of the beasts and received a scar that would remain with him for years.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|12-14}} At the moonwell, a [[Asmodeus|dark figure]] and the corrupted [[solar]] [[Zariel]] manipulated Helene, and transferred the spirit of the dead [[red dragon|dragon]] [[Skadaurak]] into the body of [[Rayonde]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|17-19}} After these tragedies, Xander and his companions each went their separate ways in life, despite his best efforts to keep them together.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|6}}

Wholly distraught by the loss of his brother, Xander pleaded for Helene to get help.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|5-8}} Xander found the twins injured and made sure Solivigant took them to safety. Xander attacked the aspect of [[Asmodeus]] that appeared on the isle, but was corrupted as a servant of the fiend instead and forced to attack Helene. His fate after that was unknown.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|13-18}}
