'''Kalif Maniozimus''' was an administrator of the city of [[Pazar]] in the [[Raurin]], and the last administrator to leave the dying city. Before he left, he had a statue erected to himself.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|36}}

Before he too abandoned Pazar, Maniozimus ordered a massive statue of himself to be built atop the dome of the [[Temple of Eilish]], which was the highest rooftop left in the city.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|37}}

Over time, this statue became half-buried in the sands and eroded by time and desert winds,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}} Those who stood too close to the statue while uncovering and reading the tablet were at risk of falling into a sinkhole and ultimately landing in the Temple of Eilish.
