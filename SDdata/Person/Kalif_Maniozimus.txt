Kalif Maniozimus was an administrator of the city of Pazar in the Raurin, and the last administrator to leave the dying city. Before he left, he had a statue erected to himself.
Before he too abandoned Pazar, Maniozimus ordered a massive statue of himself to be built atop the dome of the Temple of Eilish, which was the highest rooftop left in the city.
Over time, this statue became half-buried in the sands and eroded by time and desert winds, Those who stood too close to the statue while uncovering and reading the tablet were at risk of falling into a sinkhole and ultimately landing in the Temple of Eilish.
