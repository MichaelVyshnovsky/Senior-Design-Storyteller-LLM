==Activities==
The Caliph of Shadows was very busy as plots to kill or overthrow him went with the territory of leading the largest band of [[holy slayer]]s in all of [[Zakhara]]. He often traveled around the fortress of [[Sarahin]] in perfect disguise to better spy on his subordinates and uncover plots.

Marwan swore that he would never leave the mountain upon which Sarahin rests.

Some that he carried on his person at all times included magical studded leather armor, a ''[[mamluk sword of obedience]]'', a ''[[robe of eyes|jellaba of eyes]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'', a ''[[wand of size alteration]]'', and a ''[[scroll of protection from genies]]''.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Cardsheets}}
