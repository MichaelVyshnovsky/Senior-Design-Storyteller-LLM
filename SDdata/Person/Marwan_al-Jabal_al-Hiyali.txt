Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali served as Grandfather of the Everlasting in 1367 DR.
The Grandfather of the Everlasting was both wise and wicked, going so far as to kill his own son because he displayed cowardice.
The Shadow Caliph was a middle-aged man but remained in top physical condition.
The Caliph of Shadows was very busy as plots to kill or overthrow him went with the territory of leading the largest band of holy slayers in all of Zakhara. He often traveled around the fortress of Sarahin in perfect disguise to better spy on his subordinates and uncover plots.
Marwan swore that he would never leave the mountain upon which Sarahin rests.
Marwan was served by a trusted sect of holy slayers called the Loyalists. The oathbinder genie Halfana al-Yamini was also his to command.
As leader of the Everlasting, Marwan had access to many magical items. Some that he carried on his person at all times included magical studded leather armor, a mamluk sword of obedience, a jellaba of eyes, a ring of protection, a ring of shooting stars, a wand of size alteration, and a scroll of protection from genies.
