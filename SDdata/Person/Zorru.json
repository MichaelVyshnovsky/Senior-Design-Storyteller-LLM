        "Description": "He had red skin and two large horns that arched back from his brow.",
        "Possessions": "Zorru wore a suit of [[chainmail]] armor and armed himself with a [[bow]] and [[arrow]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, all the tieflings of Elturel were cast out of the city, following its [[the Descent|brief descent]] into the [[Nine Hells]]. Zorru was among the refugees who began to follow [[Zevlor]], an exiled cavalryman from Elturel's [[Hellriders]]. The group traveled west towards the great metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]], but were beset by [[goblin]] war bands during their journey. They managed to find refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]] for a time, though it was hardly an ideal situation. Zorru remained anxious that more goblins would siege the [[druid]]'s grove and endanger himself and his fellow tieflings."
