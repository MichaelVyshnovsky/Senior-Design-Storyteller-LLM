        "mainbody": "Zorru was a tiefling from Elturel who spent some time in the Emerald Grove during the late 15 century DR.\nHe had red skin and two large horns that arched back from his brow. \nZorru wore a suit of chainmail armor and armed himself with a bow and arrows.\nIn the , all the tieflings of Elturel were cast out of the city, following its brief descent into the Nine Hells. Zorru was among the refugees who began to follow Zevlor, an exiled cavalryman from Elturels Hellriders. The group traveled west towards the great metropolis of Baldurs Gate, but were beset by goblin war bands during their journey. They managed to find refuge at the Emerald Grove for a time, though it was hardly an ideal situation. Zorru remained anxious that more goblins would siege the druids grove and endanger himself and his fellow tieflings."
