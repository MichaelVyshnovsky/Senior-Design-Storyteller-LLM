Ramenhorus II was the eighth pharaoh of Mulhorand.
Ramenhorus II was born in 895 DR. He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 922 DR, after the former pharaoh Horustep II had died in battle against the Red Wizards of Thay during a half-hearted attempt to prevent the nation from seceding from the Second Mulhorand Empire. Ramenhorus II would die later that year during the same ongoing conflict.
