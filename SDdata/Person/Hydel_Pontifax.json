        "mainbody": "ir Hydel Pontifax was an experienced adventurer and a friend of Artus Cimber. \nHe was a devoted follower of Mystra.\nHydel Pontifax hailed from a well off Cormyrian family and at a young age was tasked with mopping his fathers store to teach the boy responsibility and value of hard work.\nIn 1352 DR, he saved Artus from a prison in Zhentil Keep and together they decided to search for the Ring of Winter and were opposed by Kaverin Ebonhand and his Cult of Frost minions.\nFinally, in 1362 DR, they found the location of the Ring in Chult but when they arrived at the designated spot they found Kaverin. In the subsequent battle, Hydel was killed but he did not go immediately to the Fugue Plane. Instead, he appeared in the Temple of Ubtao in Mezro, where Hydel failed a test and was condemned by the god Ubtao, who ruled over Chult, to become a ghost. However, Mystra, the goddess that Hydel venerated, intervened and reclaimed his soul. Until the two gods resolved the situation, he existed as a spirit and in that form he helped Artus to finish his quest. Afterward, Hydel resided in Artuss quarters in Suzail, waiting to know his final destination."
