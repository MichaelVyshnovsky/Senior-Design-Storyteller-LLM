        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ardent Low was forced to gain entrance and perform inspections of the \"Old [[Garlow]]'s Place\" in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], after the building owner failed to respond to communications from the city. Ardent determined the abandoned building to be in gross violation of the city by-laws 38a-39c and had it condemned in accordance with by-law 42a. Liaison Low left a notice on Garlow's home, and recommended the owner to contact the local [[Builders' Guild (Baldur's Gate)|Builder's Guild]] representative in regards of immediate repairs."
