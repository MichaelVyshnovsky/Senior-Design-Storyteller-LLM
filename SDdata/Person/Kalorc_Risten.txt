}}High Watcher '''Kalorc Risten''' was a senior [[cleric]] of [[Helm]] who worked at [[Luskan]]'s Helmite temple in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Description==
The priest wore shining armor and a large open-faced, plumed [[helmet]].

==History==
In the late 1360s [[DR]], Kalorc and his young assistant [[Beribold]] were hired by the lord of [[Auckney]], [[Feringal Auck]], to cure the condition of [[Biaste Ganderlay]] known as [[the wilting]]. His assistant was successful, and Kalorc assessed that the condition had been completely cured.

The senior priest initiated the noble marriage ceremony between Lord Feringal and his bride, [[Meralda Ganderlay]]. However, it was interrupted by the young [[Jaka Sculi]], who appeared on a cliff above, declaring his love for the bride. The groom requested Risten to magically [[silence]] the man, but the distance to Jaka was over the limit of the spell's range, and he did not have it prepared. After Jaka fell from the cliff, the ceremony was cancelled.
