'''Cruven Gantara''' was a [[barbarian]] warrior from [[Tuern]] whose legacy was the subject of much interest by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was a known traveling companion of [[Belast Messandar]], an [[elven]] adventurer.

==History==
After his death, Cruven was interred within the [[Valley of the Ancients]] near [[Ebon Downs]] in the [[Silverwisp Swamp]]. His burial mound was marked by four small obelisks, each of which were protected by a handful of spectral guardians.

As of the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Cruven was believed to have been the last person to travel through the ''[[portal]]'' on Tuern that linked the island to the mainland of [[Faer√ªn]].<ref group="note">The ''[[Neverwinter: Tyranny of Dragons]]'' module states the portal terminates on the [[Sword Coast]] while other sources state its location in [[Icewind Dale]]. Around that same time the ''portal'' was highly sought after by the Cult of the Dragon,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 5}}
