        "mainbody": "'''Shield of Innocence''' was an [[orog]] who was also a [[paladin]] of [[Torm]], which is an unlikely combination. He had faith placed in him by Queen [[Zaranda Star]] of [[Tethyr]].\n{{Quote|I was unworthy&mdash;all are unworthy. Yet the god chose me. His hand lifted me up and remade me, perhaps because I was unworthiest of all. I cannot question the will of [[Torm]], praised be his name.|Shield of Innocence}}",
        "Description": "Shield of Innocence had rough, gray-green skin, which he kept very clean. Unlike most orogs, Shield had small, bloodshot eyes, with clear, blue irises.",
        "Personality": "Shield of Innocence was unmoving in his beliefs and convictions. He acted based on what he believed Torm to have told him.",
        "Abilities": "Like most members of his race, Shield was exceptionally strong. He was able to tie large metal nails into knots with his fingers. He was, however, not particularly intelligent.",
        "Possessions": "Shield of Innocence wore a finely polished [[steel]] [[skullcap]]&mdash;and fought with two [[scimitar]]s, which were carried in [[bronze]] [[scabbard]]s worn over his back.\n\nHe wore a [[cloak]] and the [[gold]]en [[amulet]] with the holy symbol of Torm about his neck.",
        "History": "Shield of Innocence kept his past, including his original [[orc]]ish name, a secret. All that he revealed was that he was chosen and \"remade\" by Torm, renamed, and given a holy quest.\n\nIn the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Shield of Innocence was passing through [[Tethyr]], when he was stopped by a mob of peasants who wanted to slay him, assuming him to be evil. This encounter was interrupted by Zaranda Star, as she traveled with her caravan to [[Zazesspur]] to sell goods. Zaranda talked down the peasants, listened to the orog's story, and welcomed him into her party, when he kneeled before her and claimed that Torm had sent her to him to be his mistress. When they reached sight of Zazesspur, he claimed that Torm had prophesied that Shield would die in that city.\n\nOn [[Mirtul]] 3, [[1367 DR]], he saved the lives of Zaranda and [[Vander Stillhawk]], the latter of whom he also resurrected, when he sacrificed his own life to destroy a lower-planar [[fiend]] while the group was putting the [[Days of Terror]] to an end.\n\nQueen Zaranda petitioned the [[Loyal Order of Innocents]] to consider the Shield of Innocence as their new patron saint after his death."
