        "History": "During his life, Sorlan was an [[adventurer]] who was captured by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and transported to the Doomvault dungeon where he was subjected to horrible experiments until he died. As a cruel twist of fate, he rose as a ghost but was eternally bound to the place of his death. In 1486 DR, Sorlan was still waiting for some end to his torments."
