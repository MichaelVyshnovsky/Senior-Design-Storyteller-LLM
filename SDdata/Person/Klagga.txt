Tracker Klagga was a goblin raider that was among the group that joined the Cult of the Absolute stationed at the Shattered Sanctum during the late 15 century DR.
Klagga had one "stumpy" leg and a notably bad eye. He bore the mark of the Absolute.
At some point, the drow woman Minthara traveled out from Moonrise Towers and visited the Shattered Sanctum. There she took note of Klagga, and told him he may some actual worth if he fought as well as he played games with his fellow goblins. Klagga was absolutely smitten. He finally wrote her a love letter and stashed it behind a waterfall near the sanctum, hopeful to offer it to her after the next raid.
Klagga was among the raiding party that pillaged the inn of Waukeens Rest in the . His greatest treasure from the raid was a pair of blue pants he stole from a dwarven man, which he felt looked exceptionally good on him. He even recovered some poetry written by the dwarf, which was in fact encoded secrets about the inner reaches of the sanctum.
