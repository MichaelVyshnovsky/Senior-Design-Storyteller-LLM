Zhallandra Valenz was the leader of the drow of the new community of Spiderhaven inside Undermountain in 1375 DR.
Zhallandra appeared to be amiable and even charming but in truth had a black heart.
Zhallandra and her brother Xanderdross Valenz were sent to Spiderhaven in order to discover the cause of the destruction of the citadel of Belkrams Fall. In the meantime, they worked for anyone how paid them.
Zhallandra and her brother offered their services as investigators and finders of lost things. They directed a network of goblin spies to collect information about the citadel.
Zhallandra was always together with her brother Xanderdross.
