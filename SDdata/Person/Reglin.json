        "mainbody": "Reglin was a proxy of the Norse power known as Heimdall.\nReglin was a tall and strong man, with blond hair and brown eyes.\nReglin could invoke Heimdall to cast prismatic wall.\nReglin wielded a broadsword for a weapon. He typically favored dressing in clothes and decorations that were shades of red and yellow.\nAs a proxy of a god of guards and sentries, Reglin himself lived as a devoted sentry of the Aesir, spending much of his time guarding the Bifrost. When he wasnt on duty at the Bifrost he spent his time at Gloamingard, a longhouse he built to rest at when not on duty.\nIn the , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff journeyed to the plane of Ysgard in the Great Wheel cosmology in search of the legendary Well of Mimir, having been instructed by the citys Ministry of Art to do so in order to learn how a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine could be destroyed. They arrived in the layer of Asgard by means of a ship, While coasting through the waters of Asgard, they eventually came across Reglins Gloamingard along the shoreline.\nPrior to their arrival, the wandering realm of the Seelie Court had arrived to the area and asked for Reglins hospitality. He was quite surprised, but obliged, not wishing to offend Queen Titania. When the adventurers entered Reglins hall they found him socializing with Titania, whilst his courtiers were busy trying to keep her rowdy fey under control.\nThe adventurers were greeted by Eomar, an Asgardian warrior and member of the Fated, who went on to introduce them to Reglin and Titania. The Queen welcomed them to the plane on behalf of the Aesir, the Norse pantheon, leaving a shocked Reglin to choke from the statement. She then invited them to partake in the grand feast that Reglin had readied and expressed hope they would enjoy later festivities, which left Reglin concerned since he hadnt prepared anything.\nAfter being in Gloamingard for some time, growing irritated from the fey, the adventurers watched as Queen Titania gathered the fey around her with a clap and expressed a desire for entertainment in the form of a series of contests between the mortals and fey. Unwilling to jeopardize the lives of his own men,\nAs the competition was coming to a close Gloamingards copy of the Gjallarhorn sounded, warning of an incoming attack. Reglin jumped to his feet, brandishing his sword and shouting, \"Foes come, let friends gather!\". The eighty petitioners in the hall, who had been dancing and singing with the fey, transformed into einheriar."
