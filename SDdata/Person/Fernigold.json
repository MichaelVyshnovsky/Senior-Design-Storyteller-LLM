        "mainbody": "'''Fernigold the Elder''' was an unfortunate fishmonger from [[Daggerford]]'s [[River Quarter]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Fernigold the Elder was an older gruff man, dressed in clothes of a man of his trade.",
        "Personality": "Fernigold was a simple man who loved his trade and his son.",
        "History": "Fernigold the Elder led a mostly unremarkable life until 1372 DR, when his beloved son disappeared, seemingly without a trace. The aging fishmonger spent days searching for Fernigold the Younger in all the usual places and haunts of his son. Fernigold the Elder tried to seek aid with Daggerford's militia, but corrupt mercenary, Captain [[Dratharion]], refused, telling the fishmonger that it was his own job keeping his spawn in line. Fernigold the Elder was left to desperation and sorrow until, by happenstance or by following a rumor, the group of adventurers that later were known as the [[Hero of Daggerford|heroes of Daggerford]] came across desperate father.\n\nThe heroes of Daggerford promised to look into the disappearance. According to Fernigold, the Elder, Fernigold the Younger was an amateur treasure hunter and often bought old maps and scrolls off passing traders and caravans, hoping to get rich. The father told adventurers that his son and the son's friend [[Klevtor]] got their hands on information about an ancient ruler [[Telarthir]]'s tomb.\n\nEventually, the heroes discovered the [[Telarthir's tomb]], hidden by magics on the bottom of a crag in the [[Brush of Barbs]]. Unfortunately, Fernigold's son was slain by the tomb's undead guardians. The adventurers recovered the youth's body and returned it to grief-stricken Fernigold the Elder."
