|Ah, another outsider! I came here to bring the light of Amaunator to the darkness below, but these dwarves are too distracted by material things to pay any mind. As usual!
|Mirryn}}
==Description==
Mirryn had tied-back brown hair and light skin. She wore a suit of fine [[chain mail]] decorated in the stylings of Amaunator.

==Personality==
She was rather nonplussed at the [[dwarves]]' obsession with the [[Jewels of Ardor]] found in [[Tethyamar]], and was completely unaware of the [[demon]]ic magic behind it.

==History==
Mirryn came to Tethyamar and visited the [[Tethyamar mining outpost]] in the mid-1480s DR in order to provide healing and aid to those that delved into the ruins of the city and its mines.
