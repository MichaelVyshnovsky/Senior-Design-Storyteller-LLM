Esma was an elderly woman from Phlan that spent her time gossiping and concocting stories about others circa the 1480s DR.
Both Esma and her friend Eve were widows. They met weekly at Madame Freonas Tea Kettle, ceaselessly talking on and on about the possible lives led by passersby.
Either Esma or her friend Eve were in possession of a magical, yet still rather mundane, amulet. The amulets only dweomer kept it clean and free from tarnish.
