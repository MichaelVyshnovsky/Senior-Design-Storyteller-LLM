'''Esma''' was an elderly woman from [[Phlan]] that spent her time gossiping and concocting stories about others ''circa'' the 1480s [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|23}}{{ToD-time}}

==Relationships==
Both Esma and her friend [[Eve]] were widows. They met weekly at [[Madame Freona's Tea Kettle]], ceaselessly talking on and on about the possible lives led by passersby.

==Possessions==
Either Esma or her friend Eve were in possession of a magical, yet still rather mundane, amulet. The amulet's only [[dweomer]] kept it clean and free from tarnish.
