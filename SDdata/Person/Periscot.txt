'''Periscot''' was a [[halfling]] [[thief]] and cook in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|21}} sometime around the month of [[Flamerule]], a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of [[Chult]], which they dubbed the "[[Forgotten Island]]".{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Periscot was among the members of this group, alongside her thief husband [[Jarkus]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

On [[Marpenoth 5]], two members of the group by the names of [[Argus]] and [[Wedonai]] were patrolling the island and came across the horrifically mutilated corpse of a [[stegosaurus]]. Wedonai would go on to express concerns about angered [[spirit|forest spirit]]s, whilst Argus would tell Devlin that the creature's wounds suggested an attack from another [[dinosaur]]. Instead of letting the issue trouble his mind, Devlin decided to spent much of the day instructing Periscot in the kitchen, since their potential investor Prince [[Faruq]] of [[Calimport]] had a particular palate.

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s attacked the expedition's campsite and the team managed to slay them, but not without Argus dying and the [[fighter]] [[Mallus]] getting injured.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20-21}} an ancient [[Sunite]] relic the expedition had brought with them that was supposed to have made docile all of the animals on the island.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}}

Over the course of the next three days, the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} On the night of the third day, [[Marpenoth 19]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the [[ooze]] off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Periscot's name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.

Two days later, [[Marpenoth 22]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|8}}
