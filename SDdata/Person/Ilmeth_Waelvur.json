        "mainbody": "lmeth Waelvur was a shopkeeper in Red Larch and a member of the Believers during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nIlmeth was a hard-drinking and sullen man. He cared nothing for the troubles of others.\nIlmeth ran the Waelvurs Wagonworks. He was one of the Believers, and his objective was to use the groups influence to run his hated rivals of Thelorns Safe Journeys out of business.\nIn 1491 DR, one of the carpenters of Ilmeths shop named Stannor noticed his employer  and some others sometimes disappear into a hidden tunnel. That same year, under secret suggestions from Larrakh of the Cult of Black Earth, Ilmeth, along with Marlandro Gaelkur and Albaeri Mellikho, killed some people in order to protect the secret of the Believers. After his crimes were discovered by some adventurers, Ilmeth confessed in tears."
