        "mainbody": "Vala was a hero and an adventuring fighter, member of the Silver Blades, active in the early-to-mid 14 century DR.\nAt the age of 28, circa 1350 DR, Vala was a tall and strong, muscular human woman. She was a truly charismatic and nimble individual, despite her warriors training and build. She wore her blond hair short, and Valas pale skin was accentuated by her silvered long sword and bright elfin chainmail. She carried a powerful enchanted +4 silver shield.\nIn the , the cities of the Moonsea were abducted by an alliance of evil forces, including the deity of tyranny Bane. One of the factions that allied with the god, came from the snowy nation of Vaasa. The Banite Vaasans used powers of earth and fire elementals to tunnel from Vaasa to the Moonsea North underneath the Galena Mountains, as all passes were blocked off at the time. Vala became aware of the plot and rushed to oppose the Vaasans. Desperate for air, she hired a band of hill giants to battle the looming threat.\nSerendipitously, the same tunnels underneath the Galena Mountains hid an ancient ruined city swallowed by the earth in the ages past. Vala tasked the hill giants to excavate the ruins and fight its ancient guardians in search of artifacts that could turn the tide of the invasion. The magic items created by a wizard from Thar Crucible of the Tyrants Flame, the Lindenwood Staff, the Worldstone, and the Oakroot Staff were buried with the town they were created in and held the power to wrestle the control over the elemental away from the Banite Vaasans.\nIt was unrecorded whether Vala succeeded in stopping the Vaasans on her own, or if she was aided by the heroes of Phlan, or a group of her old Silver Blade allies.\nIn the early 1360s DR, Vala traveled away from the her cold homelands. She passed the town of Skull Crag where she met a group of adventurers who later became the towns heroes. She left Skull Crag humming an old amazonian tune and went on her way before the troubles in the area really began."
