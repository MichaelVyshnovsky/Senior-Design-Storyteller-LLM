Maxer Hlarr (Pronounce|MAYK|ser|refs=
Maxer was a recluse who enjoyed peace and quiet.
Maxers passion revolved around building unique magical constructs which he sent into dungeons and ruins in search of magical items.
King Azoun Obarskyr IV personally awarded Maxer his title after the wizard successfully defended Suzail against four dragons who attacked at the same time. Maxers attacks tilted the battle, saving Suzails failing mages so they were able to defeat the dragons.
Due to the impressive success of his magical constructs, Maxer had access to a veritable horde of magical items, making him particularly dangerous if threatened.
