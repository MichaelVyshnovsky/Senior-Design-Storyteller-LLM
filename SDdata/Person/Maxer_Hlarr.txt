'''Maxer Hlarr''' ({{Pronounce|MAYK|ser|refs=

==Personality==
Maxer was a recluse who enjoyed peace and quiet.

==Activities==
Maxer's passion revolved around building unique magical constructs which he sent into dungeons and ruins in search of magical items.

==History==
King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] personally awarded Maxer his title after the wizard successfully defended Suzail against four [[dragon]]s who attacked at the same time. Maxer's attacks tilted the battle, saving Suzail's failing mages so they were able to defeat the dragons.

==Possessions==
Due to the impressive success of his magical constructs, Maxer had access to a veritable horde of magical items, making him particularly dangerous if threatened.
