Alvanhendar was a cleric of Yondalla and a shopkeeper that lived in the village of Gullykin during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He used a number of unique idioms and turns of phrase when he spoke, such as offering to wager a "sour egg to a twelve pound goose" when he wanted to express certainty on a matter.
The individualistic halfling believed that all adventurers were at least a little bit out of their right mind.
He wore a suit of leather armor and carried with himself a sling and bullets.
Alvanhendar was the proprietor of a combination temple and winery in his home village, appropriately named the Temple of Yondalla and Alvanhendars Fine Wines.
