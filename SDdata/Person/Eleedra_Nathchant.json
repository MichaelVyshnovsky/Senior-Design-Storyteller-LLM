        "mainbody": "'''Eleedra Nathchant''' was a [[sorceress]] who held the title of [[Magister]] from [[407 DR]] and [[409 DR]].",
        "Personality": "She was described as sleek and witty and was a passionate manhunter. However, after her early success, she grew lackadaisical and over-confident.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|407}}, Eleedra laid a trap for the current Magister, [[Anaslas Raldimmar]], whose sport was flying as a giant [[hawk]] and hunting crude, domineering warriors. Eleedra adopted the form of a boorish warlord and, when Anaslas swooped to attack, she turned into a [[giant wasp]] and let him impale himself on her stinger. Then, before he could recover, she stung him repeatedly and turned again into an [[argos]] and ripped him to pieces. With that, Eleedra inherited the position of Magister.\n\nRather than advancing and acquiring [[magic]], Eleedra's goal was to seduce key rulers along the [[Sword Coast]], ruling from behind the throne through their devotion to her. Any who refused her advances or proved immune to her charms was slain through her magic.\n\nHowever, her plan was vague and Eleedra grew careless, not devoting enough time to her mastery of magic. This lack of arcane skill proved to be her downfall. In the {{YearlinkName|409}}, she went to the bedchamber of Lord [[Irgult Wheivron]], ruler of [[Narubel]],  for a prearranged tryst but was met by [[Eldrus Wands]], who'd been hired by Irgult to take his form. Eldrus challenged Eleedra and killed her in the ensuing spell-duel. After slaying her, Eldrus inherited the position of Magister."
