        "mainbody": "Light of Heavens was an aasimar divine champion of Lathander of the Sword Coast North in the mid–14 century DR.\nShe was the twin sister of Joy.\nShe was tall and beautiful, with the scars of battle. She carried herself with confidence.\nWhen she was born, the priests that delivered her exclaimed \"light of heavens\" (for reasons not revealed), and they decided to name her that. Her twin sister was named Joy.\nBoth sisters were raised by priests of Lathander and were determined to bring happiness and light to Faerûn. However, their methods of doing so were radically different Joy decided that dancing was the best way to bring happiness to people, and became a traveling minstrel, while Light of Heavens, believing that fighting evil wherever it could be found was the best way, swore an oath to serve as a Knight of Lathander.\nDuring the evacuation of Neverwinter in the , Light of Heavens encountered the Kalach-Cha and party in the Merchants District, where she tried to get a feel for the now-Knight-Captain of Crossroad Keep. She challenged the Kalach-Cha to a duel to test their resolve in the fight against the shadows. When the Kalach-Cha beat her, she left, but not before saying she would challenge them two more times.\nThe Kalach-Cha and companions next encountered Light of Heavens at Port Llast, where she revealed how she got the name \"Light of Heavens\". She then challenged the Kalach-Cha again, this time using a larger portion of her strength. Again, the Kalach-Cha defeated her.\nLight of Heavens then made her way to Crossroad Keep. There she challenged the Kalach-Cha again, this time at full strength again, the hero bested her. Impressed, Light of Heavens offered her services as a sergeant in the Graycloaks of Neverwinter. Evidently she left the Graycloaks following the King of Shadows defeat.\nLater that year, Light of Heavens would be encountered by another hero whilst traveling, and offer to spar with them."
