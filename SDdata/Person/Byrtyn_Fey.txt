'''Byrtyn Fey''' was the [[matron mother]] of [[House Fey-Branche]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]

==Description==
Byrtyn had a well-rounded, sensual figure. She was well aware of this and wore revealing robes and shawls in order to emphasize her appeal.

==Personality==
Byrtyn was known for being hedonistic. She seduced males and had many public "passionate affairs" and "ribald exploits."

She was also a great repository of information about the other houses in the city; in fact, this knowledge helped deter other houses from attacking her house and revealing their secrets.

==History==
Byrtyn was matron mother of House Fey-Branche by [[1367 DR]], when it was the eighth house of Menzoberranzan. Her house was long the sixth house until it became the fifth house in the {{yearlinkName|1484}}, when [[House Xorlarrin]] departed Menzoberranzan for [[Q'Xorlarrin]]. Byrtyn was still matron mother at this time and sat on the [[Council of Eight]].

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], she was still matron mother of her house.

==Abilities==
She was considered the most skilled of the matron mothers in forging alliances.

==Possessions==
Byrtyn possessed a six-headed ''[[whip of fangs]]'', but preferred to use her violet ''[[tentacle rod]]'' as a weapon. She carried a ''[[spider wand]]'' and brewed potent ''[[potions of magic resistance]]''.

==Relationships==
Byrtyn did not keep patrons regularly. However, in 1484 DR, Byrtyn's patron was [[Calagher Fey-Branche]]. She had a number of daughters.
