Skuulaghh Alskayl was a smuggler and thief from the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the 14 century DR.
Infamous for his hedonism, Skuulaghh had lots of children born in wedlock and lots of bastards born out of it. One of his sons was Ulcrimmon Alskayl. His offspring formed a clan of hunters in Maskyrs Eye in the mid-1300s DR.
Before his passing, Skuulaghh had supposedly gathered a great fortune, but his children were yet to find it as of around 1357 DR.
