'''Cereon''' was a [[sun elf]].

==Activities==
In a secret [[shadovar]] village for captured [[Chosen]], Cereon was a leader of his fellow [[elves]].

==History==
Cereon hailed from the [[Feywild]] but settled in [[Faerun]] many centuries before.

In [[1486 DR]], Cereon agreed to meet [[Dahl Peredur]], who asked his help to make his escape plan work. However, Cereon distrusted Dahl but suddenly the situation precipitated. So Cereon changed his mind and agreed to help.
