Cereon was a sun elf.
In a secret shadovar village for captured Chosen, Cereon was a leader of his fellow elves.
Cereon hailed from the Feywild but settled in Faerun many centuries before.
In 1486 DR, Cereon agreed to meet Dahl Peredur, who asked his help to make his escape plan work. However, Cereon distrusted Dahl but suddenly the situation precipitated. So Cereon changed his mind and agreed to help.
