'''Lasaonar''' was a [[drow]] swordmaster who lived in [[Ust Natha]].

==Activities==
He was known to participate in duels in the [[Ust Natha tavern]] duel arena.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], [[Gorion's Ward]], when disguised as a drow, had the chance to watch Lasaonar fight four people at once in the tavern. After this, Gorion's Ward and his party were offered to fight Lasaonar in a duel themselves.

==Possessions==
Lasaonar wore drow-made ''[[adamantine]] [[full plate armor]]'' and carried two enchanted swords that were similarly made of adamantine. Whereas one of these was an ordinary drow-made'' [[longsword]]'', as carried by several other drow, the other was actually the ''[[Blade of Searing]]'', a'' [[bastard sword]]'' that struck with fire and was made of a special alloy that would endure the sunlight once taken back to the surface, unlike other drow-made items.

== Rumors ==
It was rumored that he would give up his bastard sword to Gorion's Ward, if defeated by one of his group in combat.
