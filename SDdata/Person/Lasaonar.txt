Lasaonar was a drow swordmaster who lived in Ust Natha.
He was known to participate in duels in the Ust Natha tavern duel arena.
In 1369 DR, Gorions Ward, when disguised as a drow, had the chance to watch Lasaonar fight four people at once in the tavern. After this, Gorions Ward and his party were offered to fight Lasaonar in a duel themselves.
Lasaonar wore drow-made adamantine full plate armor and carried two enchanted swords that were similarly made of adamantine. Whereas one of these was an ordinary drow-made longsword, as carried by several other drow, the other was actually the Blade of Searing, a bastard sword that struck with fire and was made of a special alloy that would endure the sunlight once taken back to the surface, unlike other drow-made items.
It was rumored that he would give up his bastard sword to Gorions Ward, if defeated by one of his group in combat.
