Arilyn Moonblade was a half-elf assassin and Harper originally from Evereska active in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Like most half-elves, her ears were pointed and she retained her youthful appearance and vitality even into middle age. Her eyes were blue and flecked with gold, and she had a more human build than elvish, though her skin was still quite fair. She had black hair and a hint of blue beneath her skin. She generally looked more like an elf rather than a half-elf.
Arilyns typical travel outfit included boots, trousers, a dark cloak, and a simple blue tunic over a loose shirt. However, she was very skilled at disguises. Aided by her moonblade, she could take on a number of disguises, such as a Sembian courtesan, a street waif, and a cleric of Mielikki.
Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun described Arilyn as hot-headed, stubborn, and independent. She had an aversion to magic, especially teleportation and magical fire (due to having witnessed the incineration of the Hammerfell Seven). She disliked cooking.
Born around 1320 DR,She is said to be almost 40 in 1361 DR. Arilyn was the daughter of Princess Amnestria of Evermeet and the human ranger and Harper Bran Skorlsun. Before Arilyns birth, Amnestria left Evermeet in disgrace and settled in Evereska to raise Arilyn alone, taking the name Zberyl. A skilled warrior-mage and teacher at the College of Magic and Arms in Evereska, Zberyl/Amnestria was nevertheless killed by common thugs when Arilyn was less that 15 years old. The family moonblade was then passed on to Arilyn however, it had been dismantled and the moonstone (which had been entrusted to Bran as "punishment") had been replaced with topaz. Arilyn did not know anything of her royal parentage.

Arilyn became romantically involved with the Waterdhavian noble Danilo Thann, whom she traveled with and later married. Arilyn had kept Danilo at a distance for some time, until she managed to make peace with her past, her elven side and family, and with herself and was finally able to accept Danilos honest affection and love for her. Arilyn and Danilo finally formalized their relationship, overcoming their past issues and the opposition of his formidable mother, who disapproved of her sons half-elven love, an opposition hinting at secrets in the family.
Arilyn worked with Elaith Craulnobur while seeking the Harper Assassin. Despite knowing some of his background, she found him quite likable and approached him several times, despite warnings from others.
She had a brief, but passionate, relationship with the wood elf chieftain Foxfire while helping defend his tribe in Tethyr.
Arilyn established links with her family on Evermeet, at first through the young and liberal Prince Lamruil Moonflower and later with Queen Amlaruil Moonflower, after Arilyn proved herself by thwarting the machinations of Kymil Nimesin, who was conniving to bring about the end of Moonflower rule on Evermeet.
