        "Abilities": "Jurrgal was known as a prolific [[Polymorph|shapechanger]] and made extensive use of ''[[major image]]''. In combat, these powers were used to assume the form of an enemy in order to sow confusion.\n\nJurrgalâ€™s claws inflicted cursed wounds that resisted even [[Cure wounds|magical healing]].",
        "Relationships": "Jurrgal was once defeated in a duel by [[Donovan Lightfinger]] and swore revenge. Even after Donivan passed away, Jurrgal plotted to destroy the [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]], which had grown to prominence in Waterdeep off of the wealth accrued by Donovan's successful career as an [[adventurer]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Jurrgal arrived at the [[Lightfinger Estate]] and attacked the family patriarch, Terrathy Lightfinger, intending to capture the young lord and then assume his appearance and identity in order to slowly destroy the family from within. The plan soon went awry: first, Terrathy escaped Jurrgal's clutches, and second, Jurrgal was confronted by [[Kurgaloth]], a [[pit fiend]] with whom the family had made an [[infernal contract]] in exchange for protection. While Jurrgal wished to destroy the family, Kurgaloth wished to maintain it so that they could continue to serve him in a mission to gradually destabilize Waterdeep. The two soon clashed, with their conflict spiraling into chaos as monsters began rampaging across the Lightfinger Estate, drawing the attention of [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]], who sent adventurers to investigate.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = The young Lightfinger escaped my claws, but I took his place and now the estate will fall to Kurgaloth's wrath!\n| source = Jurrgal, upon his capture\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}The adventurers fought their way through the Estate and ultimately encountered Jurrgal in Terrathy's secret study, where they discovered the rakshasa's true identity and pursued it, hoping to find the young lord and discover the truth of the family's infernal contract.
