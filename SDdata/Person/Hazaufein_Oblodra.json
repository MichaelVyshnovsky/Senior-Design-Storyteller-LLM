        "Personality": "Hazaufein was often mocked by his brother [[Drizfryn Oblodra]], who said that his ability to craft was the result of being part-[[dwarf]], but Hazaufein always accepted these jests with a wan smile.",
        "Powers": "Hazaufein was a very good crafter of [[magic item]]s.",
        "Activities": "The position of house wizard was often given little consideration among the psionically powered Oblodras. Hazaufein's main duty was to create magical arms and armors for the house's warriors."
