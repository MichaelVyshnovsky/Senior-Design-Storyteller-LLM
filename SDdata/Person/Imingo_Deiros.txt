Imingo Deiros was a worshiper of Helm inhabiting the city of Yhep along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Imingo was a respected paladin who led the temple of Helm in Yhep called the Guardians Post. He was quite adamant against guarding the town from any beholder cult activity which plagued Yhep in past years.
