Verrona Eroth was the commander of the unicorn cavalry in Evermeet in 1367 DR.
Verrona was a quiet and reserved woman. Despite serving well in her job, her heart was distant. Deep inside, Verrona disliked violence and knew well that an invasion of Evermeet would cause great devastation, even if successfully repulsed, and she prayed to the Seldarine that the isle could live in peace forever.
