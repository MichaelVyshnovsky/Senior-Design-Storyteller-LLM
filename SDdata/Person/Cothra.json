As such, her main role was to ensure the temple was kept clean and to lead the remaining priests in services praying for the return of their [[god]].\n\nAs the leader of the temple in Bezantur, Cothra was at the top of the hierarchy of the Thayan [[church of Bane]].",
        "History": "Cothra assumed control of the temple sometime after the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. By the late 1360s DR, although she publicly venerated Bane and prayed for his return, she also worshiped [[Iyachtu Xvim]], who was the source of her [[Divine magic|spells]]."
