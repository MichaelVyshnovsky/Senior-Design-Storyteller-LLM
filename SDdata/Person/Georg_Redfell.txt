Georg Redfell was a male human and mayor of the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Georg was the mayor of West Harbor and the leader of its militia. He watched over the village and hosted its festival, the Harvest Fair.
When duergar and bladelings attacked the village in 1374 DR, he defended it and bade farewell to the Kalach-Cha, one of West Harbors inhabitants, who went to Neverwinter. Unfortunately, Georg was slain, along with the rest of the villagers, by Ammon Jerro and his demons.
