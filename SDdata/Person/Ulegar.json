        "Description": "Ulegar was a gruff middle-aged [[human]] male. His neck and backs of his hands were decorated with tribal [[tattoo]]s. During the ship's voyage, the tattoos' origins often sparked interest.",
        "Personality": "The Uthgardt man disliked docking in [[Samarach]], calling the city of [[Samargol]] a den of cowards.",
        "History": "In the {{Yearlink|1374}}, Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] and the ''Vigilant'' sailed from the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Chult]]an nation of Samarach.  Onboard the ship were several passengers, including [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater [[barrel]]s – ruptured, one of the crew – [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]] got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, new [[rope]]s became frayed.\n\nUlegar's life ended when the string of strange occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of [[Samargol]]. Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be eaten by the [[Batiri]]."
