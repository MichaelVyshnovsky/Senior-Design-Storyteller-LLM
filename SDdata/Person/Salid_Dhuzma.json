        "Activities": "Students from all over [[East Faerûn]] and the [[Hordelands]] would travel to the small fishing village of Khalab with the hopes of becoming Salid's next pupil. Sadly for these prospective students, Salid would only take one pupil each year.\n\nSalid lived within [[Baelzur's Tower]]. He preferred the comfort of living in a small village to the riches he could have had while living in one of the larger cities located on [[Brightstar Lake|Gbor Nor]].",
