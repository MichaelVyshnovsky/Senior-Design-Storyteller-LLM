        "mainbody": "Salid Dhuzma, or the Grand Verser of the South, was a famous bard who lived in Khalab during the mid 14h century DR.\nStudents from all over East Faer√ªn and the Hordelands would travel to the small fishing village of Khalab with the hopes of becoming Salids next pupil. Sadly for these prospective students, Salid would only take one pupil each year.\nSalid lived within Baelzurs Tower. He preferred the comfort of living in a small village to the riches he could have had while living in one of the larger cities located on Gbor Nor.\nSalim was once the apprentice of Tilmar Wanderfoot."
