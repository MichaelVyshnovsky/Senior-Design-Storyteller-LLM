        "mainbody": "edfang was a powerful lizardfolk druid based in the ruins of Omu in Chult during the late 15 century DR.\nShe was known to be able to bend even tyrannosaurs to her will. She rode a dinosaur into combat.\nRedfang was feared by the yuan-ti overlords of Omu, and her presence in the ruins was perhaps the only thing that allowed the local lizardfolk to resist being driven out.\nDuring the events of the death curse Redfang came to the attention of Ragash of the Red Mist, a member of the hunters guild in Port Nyanzaru who hunted intelligent prey. She devised a plan to lure Redfang out of hiding using a piece of freshly cut tyrannosaur tail meat."
