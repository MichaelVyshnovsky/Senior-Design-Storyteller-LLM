        "mainbody": "'''Redfang''' was a powerful [[lizardfolk]] [[druid]] based in the ruins of [[Omu]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "She was known to be able to bend even [[tyrannosaur]]s to her will. She rode a [[dinosaur]] into combat.",
        "Relationships": "Redfang was feared by the [[yuan-ti]] overlords of Omu, and her presence in the ruins was perhaps the only thing that allowed the local lizardfolk to resist being driven out.",
        "History": "During the events of the [[death curse]]{{ToA-time}} Redfang came to the attention of [[Ragash|Ragash of the Red Mist]], a member of the [[Hunters' Guild of Chult|hunters' guild]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] who hunted intelligent prey. She devised a plan to lure Redfang out of hiding using a piece of freshly cut tyrannosaur tail meat."
