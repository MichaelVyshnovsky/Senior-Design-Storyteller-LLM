Her hair was long, but after her fight with Shandril, her face became disfigured and one half of her head lost most of its hair.\nShe was a timid person, but not very loyal.\nWhen in camp, she entertained the guards.\nShe snatched a ring of teleportation from Gathlarue before their encounter with Shandril Shessair.\nShe was younger than Mairara, her fellow apprentice under Gathlarue.\nTespril accompanied Gathlarue and Mairara at Marsember when they joined the search for spellfire, hunting down Shandril Shessair.\nShe survived the fight by using the ring of teleportation shed stolen from Gathlarue, though she became badly scarred. Later, she was debriefed regarding the encounter in a meeting with Fzoul Chembryl and Sarhthor of the Zhentarim. The mage slew her at the close of the meeting, on Fzouls ambiguous direction."
