'''Blaise Hhune''' was a member of the [[Hhune]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Blaise Hhune became afflicted by [[lycanthropy]], the affliction that led him into the servitude of the [[Kozakuran]] [[vampire]] [[Cazador Szarr]], the lord of the [[Szarr Palace]] in Baldur's Gate. Along with [[Gheris Hhune]], [[Duver Rillyn]], and other [[werewolves]], Blaise massacred a party of influential guests at the Szarr Palace, shortly before Cazador attempted to perform his ascension ritual. The beasts and lycanthropes were likely put out of their misery by the [[Absolute Adversaries]] and the [[vampire spawn]] [[Astarion Ancun√≠n]].
