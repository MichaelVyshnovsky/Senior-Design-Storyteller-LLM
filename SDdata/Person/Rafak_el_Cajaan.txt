'''Rafak el Cajaan''' was a [[Calishite]] noble and the leader of a group of [[dragon]]slayers in the [[Third Age of Calimshan]].

==History==
Rafak was famous for leading a group of his family members against the Rose Dragon [[Ylveraasahlisar]], who had ruled [[Calimshan]] for 112 years. In {{Yearlink|-1726}}, his band wounded her and drove her out of [[Calimport]], where she was subsequently slain by the [[bronze dragon]] [[Cadasalmpar]].

Afterward, great infighting began in the [[Cajaan Dynasty|Cajaan]] family over which of them would rule. This fighting lasted eighteen years and resulted in the death of all males except one. Historians are not certain whether the one survivor who began ruling in {{Yearlink|-1708}} was Rafak or not.
