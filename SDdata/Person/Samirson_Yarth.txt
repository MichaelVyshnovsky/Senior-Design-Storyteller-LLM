'''Samirson Yarth''' was one of the best assassins during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Samirson was a very efficient killer living in the city of [[Urmlaspyr]] in [[Sembia]]. He was so deadly that the god [[Bhaal]] praised him. 

Yarth was in the act of killing a man when the god [[Bane]] called to him the souls of all assassins and Samirson died immediately.
