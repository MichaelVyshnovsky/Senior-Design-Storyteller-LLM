Later she was elevated to the position duchess and given command of the small Netherese enclave of [[Kolthunral]].\n\nIn 1480 DR, Clariburnus, in an attempt to gain control of [[New Neverwinter]] from [[Thay]], ordered Antethriss to attack the [[Thayan]] city of [[Surcross]]. However, after months of besieging Thay, Kolthunral crashed into the ground, thanks to the efforts of some adventurers. Antethriss likely died in the fall."
