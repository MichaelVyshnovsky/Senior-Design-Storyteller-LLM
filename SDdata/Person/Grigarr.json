        "mainbody": "'''Grigarr''' was a terrifying man who trained the [[wyvern]]s of [[Darkhold]] in the [[Far Hills]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The [[ranger]] was heavily scarred due to multiple wyvern stings.",
        "Personality": "The wyvern trainer was a combination of both terrifying and greedy. He believed that he was entertaining as a storyteller because of the good reactions of the locals, but the truth was that they humored him in their outright fear. Grigarr also claimed to be immune to wyvern [[venom]].",
        "Activities": "Grigarr was known to tell residents of Darkhold (especially in the local tavern known as the [[Rookery]]) about his experiences with the wyverns he trained, particularly about all the times he was strung.",
        "History": "After the groups of [[giant]]s that defended Darkhold were no longer present, wyverns were bred and trained to obey [[Pereghost]], the undisputed commander of the Keep of the Far Hills. Grigarr was the one who trained these wyverns."
