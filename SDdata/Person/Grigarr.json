        "mainbody": "Grigarr was a terrifying man who trained the wyverns of Darkhold in the Far Hills in the late 15 century DR.\nThe ranger was heavily scarred due to multiple wyvern stings.\nThe wyvern trainer was a combination of both terrifying and greedy. He believed that he was entertaining as a storyteller because of the good reactions of the locals, but the truth was that they humored him in their outright fear. Grigarr also claimed to be immune to wyvern venom.\nGrigarr was known to tell residents of Darkhold (especially in the local tavern known as the Rookery) about his experiences with the wyverns he trained, particularly about all the times he was strung.\nAfter the groups of giants that defended Darkhold were no longer present, wyverns were bred and trained to obey Pereghost, the undisputed commander of the Keep of the Far Hills. Grigarr was the one who trained these wyverns."
