Abella Toth was one of the Magistrates of Cormyr, who worked in Eveningstar and Wheloon in the late 15 century DR.
Abella was a human woman with an almost ghostly white skin tone, long, straight black hair, and icy blue eyes. She wore a fine official Magistrates uniform, and could be seen holding a holy symbol of Shar (no doubt kept for investigatory purposes, not her own faith).
Abella worked alongside her fellow Magistrates Celia Pendrick, Barthold Moncrief, and Cornelius Latrimor in the Wheloon Docks as they oversaw the prison and investigated situations as they arose.
In the late 15 century DR, Magistrates Abella, Celia, and Barthold traveled to Eveningstar to pursue an investigation into reported sightings of Sharrans in the Storm Horns foothills. Abella believed that the infamous Wheloon escapee Dedryk Black was hiding in the region and gathering a cult, and she sent a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron to search for him in the hills. After a successful raid on his hideout, Dedryk and some of his cultists were handed over to Magistrate Toth and her associates to be transported to Wheloon for imprisonment, personally overseen by Magistrate Moncrief. She rewarded the adventurers with a powerful holy symbol of Shar, the Guidance of Shar, trusting them to use it appropriately.
