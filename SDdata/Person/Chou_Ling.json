        "mainbody": "Chou Ling was a human warrior of Kara-Tur in the 14 century DR.\nHe was a faithful servant of the oni and tried to win their favor by any means. He would grow murderously jealous if others got too close to the creatures and threatened to take his place.\nChou Ling was known to wield an enchanted +2 long sword and wore padded armor.\nHis unwavering loyalty to the oni stemmed from his awe and and fear of the onis powers."
