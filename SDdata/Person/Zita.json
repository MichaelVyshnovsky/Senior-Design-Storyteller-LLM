Quality of reporting is arse these days.''|Zita}}",
        "Description": "Zita was an older, pale-skinned [[gold dwarf]] with a clean-shaved face. She had gray hair gathered in a braid and affixed around her head and blue eyes. Zita wore a loose white [[tunic]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Zita was employed by Baldur's Mouth and could be found outside the [[broadsheet]] publisher's office backing issues for delivery. She personally stopped reading the paper due to the sharply declined quality of reporting and [[Lord Gortash]]'s propaganda. She also was used to hearing complaints about the broadsheet's contents and simply sent everyone into the offices to talk to the editor-in-chief instead."
