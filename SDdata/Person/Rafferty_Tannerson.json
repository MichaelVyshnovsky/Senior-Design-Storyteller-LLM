        "mainbody": "Rafferty Tannerson was the middle-aged uncle of Dell Tannerson. Together, they regularly braved the elements traveling with caravans between Luskan and the Ten Towns in the late 1360s DR. \nRafferty was a middle-aged human male with black hair.\nRaff was a gruff man with abrupt speech patterns. He mistrusted adventurers, eyeing them suspiciously, and did not pay them more attention than curt acknowledgment.\nRafferty wore his leather armor as he worked and traveled with caravans. He was armed with a simple club.\nRafferty was a skilled carpenter, having to fix wagons oftentimes during the long treks north.\nDell and Rafferty showed affection towards each other, even though the gruff uncle hoped to keep Dells mind on his training, and not getting \"all mixed up with dragons and fairies\".\nIn 1369 DR, Raff traveled with his nephew in a caravan from Luskan to Targos, hired by Boswell Peddywinkle (secretly Celerum the Black, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood). Together with the disguised mage and his hired group of adventurers, they came across a destroyed and plundered caravan, discovered by Dell, which led to an encounter with a goblin marauder tribe.\nAfter the group reached the Ten Towns, Dell asked the adventurers to join them on their search for the mysterious Accursed Tower, unbeknownst to his uncle.\nCelerum charmed Raff at some point during the adventure, making the gruff man his unwavering ally."
