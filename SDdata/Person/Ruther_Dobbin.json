        "mainbody": "'''Lord Mayor Earl Ruther Dobbin''' was the leader of the village of [[Stagwick]] in [[Hartsvale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Earl Dobbin's family had ruled Stagwick for at least 36 generations. His home was [[Dobbin Manor]].\n\nEarl Dobbin was one of Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna's]] suitors and thought by many to be her most favorable choice, though she ultimately chose the [[firbolg]] [[ranger]] [[Tavis Burdun]] out of love. Ruther Dobbin was attending a [[fire giant]] dance at the [[Weary Giant]] on the same day that Princess Brianna was captured. Also, at that time, the [[verbeeg]] [[runecaster]] [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] of [[Lyndusfarne]] had stolen a book from Dobbin that had been written by his relative, titled ''[[A Full History of the Dobbins of Stagwick]]''."
