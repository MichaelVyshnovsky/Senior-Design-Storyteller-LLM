Varissa was the human wife of the giant Hartkiller.
Varissa was the daughter of one of the first earls of Hartsvale. She and Hartkiller had a half-giant son named Brun,
After Hartkiller unified the barbarian tribes of the valley that would become Hartsvale, they gathered together in the Bleak Plain at midnight. Here, the barbarian chieftains were first named earls, and the people unanimously selected Hartkiller to rule them. It was during this meeting that Hartkiller first met Varissa. Shortly, they fell in love and were married.
