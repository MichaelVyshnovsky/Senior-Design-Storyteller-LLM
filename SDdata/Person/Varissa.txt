'''Varissa''' was the [[human]] wife of the [[giant]] [[Hartkiller]].

==Relationships==
Varissa was the daughter of one of the first earls of [[Hartsvale]]. She and Hartkiller had a [[half-giant]] son named [[Brun]],

==History==
After Hartkiller unified the [[barbarian]] tribes of the valley that would become Hartsvale, they gathered together in the [[Bleak Plain]] at midnight. Here, the barbarian chieftains were first named earls, and the people unanimously selected Hartkiller to rule them. It was during this meeting that Hartkiller first met Varissa. Shortly, they fell in love and were married.
