        "History": "After the explosion at the mansion of the [[archmage]] [[Larak Dardulkyn]], Rorlyn Handmane was sent by the [[War Wizards]] to investigate and offer reasonable aid, mindful that he may not wish to have his home surveyed by fellow workers of [[the Art]]. He was coldly dismissed by Dardulkyn, who was at the moment mind-ridden by the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]]."
