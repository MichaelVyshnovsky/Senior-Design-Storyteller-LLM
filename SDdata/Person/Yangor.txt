'''Yangor''' was a [[bearded devil]] who was on [[Avernus]] for some time during the {{yearlinkName|1492}}.

==History==
Along with his fellow [[Narg]], Yangor served as a bodyguard for the [[chain devil]] [[Zartar]]. The pair watched over Zartar during a pilgrimage to the site known as [[Sundered Chains]], as the chained devil sought to claim more power from the god [[Asmodeus]].
