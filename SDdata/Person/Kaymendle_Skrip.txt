Kaymendle Skrip was a bumbling Sembian wizard, responsible for magicks that altered the weather in Cormyr as of the late 14 century DR.
The well-meaning wizard was difficult to deter, but skulked away after his first failure.
While his more traditional abilities were not known, Kaymendle was responsible for Kaymendles dog and Kaymendle bolts.
Kaymendle Skrip was hired in Southern Harrowdale to find a solution to the occassional torrential downpours he created an apparition resembling a dog, which he believed could scare clouds away by barking. This apparition, Kaymendles dog, failed to perform its barking had no effect on the rain or trajectory of any clouds.
He was later hired in the Thunder Peaks, north of the Hullack Forest. There, he attempted to mitigate lightning bolt damage to farms by making the bolts of lightning so heavy that they would fall without causing any damage. The Kaymendle bolts were a mixed success while indeed some bolts of lightning fell too quickly due to their weight, they became continuing hazards, and he was chased away.
Kaymendle eventually retired to a secluded laboratory in the Arch Wood in the late mid-14 century DR.
As of the late mid-14 century DR, Kaymendle was said to be working on elastic snow that bounced back after falling.
