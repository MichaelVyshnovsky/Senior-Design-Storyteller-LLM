'''Kaymendle Skrip''' was a bumbling [[Sembian]] wizard, responsible for magicks that altered the weather in Cormyr as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
The well-meaning wizard was difficult to deter, but skulked away after his first failure.

==Abilities==
While his more traditional abilities were not known, Kaymendle was responsible for [[Kaymendle's dog]] and ''[[Kaymendle bolt]]s''.

==History==
Kaymendle Skrip was hired in Southern Harrowdale to find a solution to the occassional torrential downpours; he created an apparition resembling a dog, which he believed could scare clouds away by barking. This apparition, Kaymendle's dog, failed to perform; its barking had no effect on the rain or trajectory of any clouds.

He was later hired in the [[Thunder Peaks]], north of the [[Hullack Forest]]. There, he attempted to mitigate lightning bolt damage to farms by making the bolts of lightning so heavy that they would fall without causing any damage. The ''Kaymendle bolts'' were a mixed success; while indeed some bolts of lightning fell too quickly due to their weight, they became continuing hazards, and he was chased away.

Kaymendle eventually retired to a secluded laboratory in the [[Arch Wood]] in the late mid-14{{th}} century DR.

==Rumors & Legends==
As of the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], Kaymendle was said to be working on elastic snow that bounced back after falling.
