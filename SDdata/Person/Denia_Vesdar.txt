Denia Vesdar was a spy for the Zhentarim, who worked in the Tower of the Blades in the city of Mulmaster. She had attained her rank after proving herself time and again, beginning her career as a mere soldier within Zhentil Keep.
Standing about 5 6" (1.6 m) tall with relatively plain features and a pale complexion, Denias unassuming features served her well in assuming the various identities that were required to complete her missions for the Zhents.
