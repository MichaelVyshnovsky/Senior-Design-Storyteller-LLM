Emissary Xivros was one of the many Red Wizards of Thay serving under Valindra Shadowmantle in Neverwinter in 1484 DR.
The emissary Xivros decided to raise the powerful ancient ogre warrior Arleon the Unforgiven as an undead to guide Valindras undead army in the conquest of the city. Xivros succeeded in his ritual and Arleon the Unforgiven became a wight. However, soon after, an adventurer sent by Sergeant Knox to stop the plot arrived and fought and defeated the ogre wight and likely killed Xivros as well.
