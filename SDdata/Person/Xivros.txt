Emissary '''Xivros''' was one of the many [[Red Wizards of Thay]] serving under [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] in [[Neverwinter]] in [[1484 DR]].

==History==
The emissary Xivros decided to raise the powerful ancient [[ogre]] warrior [[Arleon|Arleon the Unforgiven]] as an [[undead]] to guide Valindra's undead army in the conquest of the city. Xivros succeeded in his ritual and Arleon the Unforgiven became a [[wight]]. However, soon after, an adventurer sent by Sergeant [[Knox]] to stop the plot arrived and fought and defeated the ogre wight and likely killed Xivros as well.
