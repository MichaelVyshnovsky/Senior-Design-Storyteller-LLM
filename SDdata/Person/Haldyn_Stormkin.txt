Haldyn Stormkin was a human man and a fighter. He was a Merchant Duke of the city of Calaunt in the Vast.
Haldyn was a giant of a man, standing 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall and possessing great strength.
Haldyn was formerly an adventurer in Bellass Band, under Bellas Thanatar. Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellass orders.
Around the 1330s DR, Bellass Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself Supreme Scepter, while Haldyn took the title of Merchant Duke. They now grew wealthier and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule.
Haldyn and the dukes grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, Haldyn had one vote while Bellas had two.
Haldyn and the Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly "for the benefit of the city", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of magical items this way, and still sought more.
Haldyn lived in a palatial house close to the Fortress of the Five Vultures.
