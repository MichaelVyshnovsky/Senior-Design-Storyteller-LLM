'''Haldyn Stormkin''' was a [[human]] man and a [[fighter]]. He was a [[Merchant Duke]] of the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]].

==Description==
Haldyn was a giant of a man, standing 9 feet (2.7 meters) tall and possessing great strength.

==History==
Haldyn was formerly an [[adventurer]] in [[Bellas's Band]], under [[Bellas Thanatar]]. Each member of the band grew wealthy by following Bellas's orders.

Around the 1330s DR, Bellas's Band took power in the city of Calaunt. Bellas named himself [[Supreme Scepter]], while Haldyn took the title of [[Merchant Duke]]. They now grew wealthier and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule.

==Activities==
Haldyn and the dukes grew increasingly wealthy and powerful by following Bellas and supporting his rule. In all decisions on major policies, Haldyn had one vote while Bellas had two.

Haldyn and the Dukes often confiscated property and magic from visitors, allegedly "for the benefit of the city", but mostly used it only for personal gain and use, to increase their power. They acquired a large collection of [[magical item]]s this way, and still sought more.

Haldyn lived in a palatial house close to the [[Fortress of the Five Vultures]].
