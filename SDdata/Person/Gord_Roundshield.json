As Skeld, Gord, Taggot, and Tori all give Lore entries about their respective dwarfholds and have dwarf-specific quests, it may be assumed that all four were part of the same group.\nIn the , the four dwarf companions came to Neverwinter to offer their aid to the beleaguered city. Learning of the Many-Arrows orcs occupation of the Tower District, Gord charged in to wage a one-dwarf war upon them. Skeld asked a fellow dwarf adventurer to check up on Gord and ask him to return. However, Gord had been injured by an Eye of Gruumsh shaman known only as the Black Eye, and wouldnt leave until he had vengeance. Gord ask the fellow dwarf adventurer to burn a shrine to Gruumsh and slay the Black Eye. After that, Gord agreed to return to Skeld soon."
