Lord Mhorauk was a nobleman of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He came off as a younger lordling, implying he was younger than other lordlings.
He came off as impatient.
He was known to the bodyguard of Lord Haelwing, Oskrul Meddanthyr.
Lord Mhorauk was at the Old Kings Favorite eatery on one morning when Lord Haelwing got very drunk, and his wizardly bodyguard, Oskrul Meddanthyr, started drinking recklessly and talking about many subjects. He was not very courteous with the wizard, but got him to admit he didnt know who trapped the Nine into blueflame items.
