        "History": "Dameron Keel was one of the Vilhonese who openly acknowledged the region's reputation and pointed out its underlying darkness. Dameron stated that all just and great things in the Realms came from the Vilhon Reach, only according to the teachers and poets of the [[Academia Vilhonus]]. Merchant Keel pointed out that these tales always left out wars, corruption, wickedness, and slavery that stated the reputation of various nations and city-states of the region. He called the Vilhon Reach the \"literal paradise with pitfalls.\""
