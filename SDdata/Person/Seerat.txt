Seerat the Green was an Emerald Enclave druid in Twilight Marsh near Phlan in 1489 DR.
When the black dragon Throstulgrael arrived in the area, Seerat was captured by the dragons kobold minions. Later, fellow Enclave member Seranolla asked an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragons lair to free him but unfortunately Seerat had been killed some time before by the kobolds.
