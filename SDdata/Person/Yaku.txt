'''Yaku''' was an ancient [[earth spirit]] from the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]] who resided on the [[Yaku Plains]], active millennia before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Yaku came into existence on the Malatran Plateau a millennia before the 14{{th}} century DR, alongside his brother, [[Kuya]]. Yaku made his home the [[Yaku Plains]], west of the [[Fire Mountain]] â€“ the home of Kuya.

Eventually, a mysterious calamity incinerated Yaku Plains, ancient to the [[Nubari]] of the 14{{th}} century DR. It was believed that ancient dark magic, similar to those imbued into the fabled ''[[Necromancer's Stone (Malatra)|Necromancer's Stone]]'' was responsible for the disaster.{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Necromancer's Stone|4}} With the plains' death, Yaku left the [[Prime Material plane]] or died with the land, leaving nothing but pain in the land behind.

In the Year of Tigers Curse on the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle came across Yaku's brother. The earth spirit felt his brother's absence, and his sadness was turned into despair when the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] who inhabited the Fire Mountain began poisoning nature around. Yaku's fate was unknown to Kuya, as well as it remained unrecorded whether the heroes revealed the history of the Yaku Plains disaster to the lonely spirit.
