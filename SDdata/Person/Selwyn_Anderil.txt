'''Selwyn Anderil''' was a farmer during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Activitivies==
Selwyn managed a farm in the valley.

==History==
Selwyn went to the Dessarin Valley with his wife [[Maygan Anderil|Maygan]] in [[1484 DR]] and built a farm. Later, he employed two brothers from [[Waterdeep]], [[Ob Lavelle|Ob]] and [[Fip Lavelle]], as workers.

In [[1491 DR]], the [[Iceshield]] [[orc]]s attacked the farm, capturing Maygan and the Lavelle brothers and injuring Selwyn. He was later saved by some adventurers.
