Selwyn Anderil was a farmer during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Selwyn managed a farm in the valley.
Selwyn went to the Dessarin Valley with his wife Maygan in 1484 DR and built a farm. Later, he employed two brothers from Waterdeep, Ob and Fip Lavelle, as workers.
In 1491 DR, the Iceshield orcs attacked the farm, capturing Maygan and the Lavelle brothers and injuring Selwyn. He was later saved by some adventurers.
