'''Belkram''' was an insane [[undead]] [[dwarf]] of [[Clan Melairkyn]] inside [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Activities==
Belkram resided in his tomb in the citadel of [[Belkram's Fall]], protecting the [[Crown Adamant]]. He would attack anyone that tried to recover it, even the rightful heir. He had with him a [[fiendish]] [[dire wolf]].

==History==
Belkram was the high cleric of [[Dumathoin]] in Clan Melairkyn. Somehow, he acquired the Crown Adamant, which Belkram granted to King [[Melair I]] for his coronation. Afterward, Belkram was tasked by Dumathoin to always keep an eye upon the crown.

However, in time he tried to find a way to end his task, growing so desperate that he betrayed the location of the Crown to the [[drow]] of [[House Tanor'Thal]]. The drow raided [[Melairbode]] and Dumathoin [[curse]]d him to become an [[undead]] and guard the Crown for all eternity. For a time, he lived as a hermit in the [[Underdark]]. Later, trying to die, he jumped inside a lava tube but in time his body regenerated itself.

Later, he retreated into the cemetery of the [[Melair]] kings in the citadel in order to protect the Crown Adamant.

If the rightful heir of Clan Melairkyn regained the Crown, Belkram's curse would finally be ended and he would die for good.

==Personality==
In life, Belkram became frustrated that he had to dedicate his whole life to the Crown and this caused him to make very horrible decisions.

In undeath, Belkram manifested a strange mix of honor and insanity. He wanted to kill everyone but respected able warriors.

==Powers==
While he wore the crown, Belkram regenerated his injuries constantly.

==Rumors==
Tales told by bards said that Belkram jumped head first into a vast lava tube within Undermountain for no apparent reason.
