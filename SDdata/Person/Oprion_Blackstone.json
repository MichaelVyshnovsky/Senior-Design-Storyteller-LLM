        "mainbody": "Oprion Blackstone was a Banite priest in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe had a wintry gaze.\nHe knew how to scry. Whether personally or through others, Manshoon believed him capable of casting resurrection.\nHe claimed mageslayer after Fzoul Chembryls death.\nHe took control of the priestly side of the Zhentarim after the deaths of Elthaulin and Fzoul Chembryl.\nFzoul Chembryl taught him to scry,\nOprion Blackstone was one of the priests that Elthaulin called on to seize control of the Citadel after Fzoul engaged in combat with Shandril Shessair.\nAfter Shandrils last frontal assault on Zhentil Keep, causing the death of Fzoul Chembryl, Oprion impersonated Manshoon and sent a speaking stone to Eveningstar, which carried a message from him impersonating Manshoon to Shandril. In the message, he made the claim that the Brotherhood would no longer seek her spellfire. While scrying on the stone, he caught some of a conversation with Elminster. Then the real Manshoon turned up and told Oprion to get on with resurrecting Fzoul.\nHe later contemplated the possibility of ignoring Manshoons coming request for parley after Shandrils death, only to be warned by local beholders that they would kill him for that."
