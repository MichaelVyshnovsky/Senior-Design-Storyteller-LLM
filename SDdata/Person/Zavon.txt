'''King Zavon''' was a [[windsoul genasi]] and the ruler of [[Akanûl]] in the early years of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Zavon was the father of [[Cyndra]] and the grandfather of [[Arathane]].

==History==
Zavon was elected as the first king of Akanûl by the nobility, around [[1400 DR]], after they established the ''Covenant of Monarchy'' to end the civil war that has been fought since the foundation of the kingdom.

King Zavon was killed in [[1429 DR]], when the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] destroyed the city of [[Brassune]]. He was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Cyndra.
