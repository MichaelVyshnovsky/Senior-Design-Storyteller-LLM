        "History": "Brin fought alongside [[Uthalion]] in [[Caidris]] when the village was attacked by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. He was addicted to [[silkroot]], which was slowly killing him.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], he was hired by [[Ghaelya]] to journey to [[Tohrepur]] in the [[Mere-That-Was]] region of [[Akan没l]] on a mission to rescue Ghaelya's twin sister from a cult known as [[The Choir]]. Brindani sought the help of his old friend Uthalion, who was living in the [[Spur Forest]]. Together, they traveled with Ghaelya through the Mere-That-Was. While passing through the village of Caidris, Brindani was briefly captured by a member of The Choir, who corrupted him so that he slowly turned into an [[aberration]]. When the group reached Tohrepur, they confronted Lord [[Khault]], the leader of The Choir. Brindani killed Khault but died from injuries he received during the fight.",
