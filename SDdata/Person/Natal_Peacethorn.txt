'''Natal Peacethorn''' was [[Janesta Leafgrace]]'s friend. On {{yearlink|1375}}, while studying standing stones that showed the path to a [[Stardeep/Causeway|Causeway]], they found the mist between the stones dissipating and the path open for the first time. Entering, they saw the Gate of [[Stardeep]]. The day after, their encampment was attacked by [[Empyrean Knights]], leaving his friend Janesta as the only survivor.{{cite book/Stardeep|138-139|11}} During the attack, she saw him dragged out of his home.{{cite book/Stardeep|103|9}}
