        "mainbody": "'''Huum''' was a [[mind flayer]] who resided in [[Sporedome]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Ahhhh. Come innnnn. I have tea waiting on the table. You musssst be dyyyying of thirsssst.''|Huum}}",
        "Description": "Purple-skinned and hairless, Huum's tentacles writhed around his mouth.",
        "Personality": "Huum kept to himself mostly, living something of a hermit existence in Sporedome and only communicating with nearby [[myconid]]s.",
        "Abilities": "Skilled in the [[psionic]] arts like most mind flayers, Huum was able to communicate telepathically with ease and even read minds. Despite this, his ability to read minds was not strong enough to pry into the thoughts of [[Solom Ned'razak]], a powerful [[drow]] [[archmage]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|21}}",
        "Possessions": "Huum considered a certain brooch, in the possession of Solom Ned'razak, to be his.\n\nIn his abode, Huum had control over a one-way ''[[teleportation]]'' circle to [[Szith Morcane]].",
        "Relationships": "He was on friendly terms with the myconids of Sporedome but held a dislike for the leader of Szith Morcane, Solom Ned'razak.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1490 DR]], Huum resided in Sporedome alongside a community of myconids. He sought to acquire a brooch from Solom Ned'razak, which Huum believed protected the drow archmage from his psionic power. In actuality, the brooch was nonmagical, and Solom's willpower was simply stronger than Huum's abilities, and the former had managed to convince the illithid that the brooch protected him.\n\nHuum acted as a proxy for its [[elder brain]] to join the assault on [[Maerimydra]].{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|11}}"
