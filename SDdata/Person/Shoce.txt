Shoce was an early knight of Neverwinter and the fifth of the Nine knights who served Lord Halueth Never. They were the basis for the Neverwinter Nine.
Shoce survived battles against three dragons, but died due to the treachery of a fourth dragon. Afterward, a statue of Shoce and his sword stood guard in Halueths tomb.
