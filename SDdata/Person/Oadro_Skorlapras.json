        "mainbody": "Oadro Skorlapras was an Amnian mercenary leader who met his end in Tethyr.\nSometime following the restoration of Tethyrs monarchy in 1369 DR, Oadro took his company of soldiers there to earn his fortune. He hired himself out to the opportunistic nobles of the realm who wanted an armed and ruthless force that could handle inconvenient commoners, other nobles, and even the Crown. When he tried to put some uppity commoners in their place, he learned that the folk of Tethyr had no tolerance for bloody-handed foreign mercenaries, and Oadro and his mercenaries were killed to a man."
