The Crusaders were formed to defend the duke, led by the dukes son, Korox, and his friends, including Purdon and several others. The adventuring party successfully stopped no fewer than four attempts to murder Duke Morkann, though they never were able to link the assassination attempts definitively back to the Duke of Dusk.
