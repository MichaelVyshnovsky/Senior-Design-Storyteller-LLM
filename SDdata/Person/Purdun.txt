Lord '''Purdun "the Firefist"''' was the baron of [[Ahlarkhem]] in [[Erlkazar]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and a former member of [[Elestam's Crusaders]].

==Description==
Baron Purdun had red hair and three scars across his left cheek.

==Crest==
The baron's personal crest was a [[shield]] above two crossed [[sword]]s, colored royal blue and [[jade]] green.

==Personality==
Though he had a reputation for a "fiery" personality&mdash;as indicated by his nickname&mdash;Purdun was, in truth, a calm and diplomatic man with a steady demeaner.

==Abilities==
Purdun was an [[invoker]], 

==Relationships==
Purdun was one of King [[Korox Morkann]]'s best friends, and Purdun was married to the king's younger sister, [[Dijara Morkann|Dijara]]. The noble couple were among the king's strongest supporters.

==History==
During the reign of Duke [[Valon Morkann]], Purdun's father-in-law, the so-called [[Duke of Dusk]] from the neighboring duchy of [[Tethyr]] plotted with several counts and barons of [[Elestam]] to overthrow and assassinate Duke Morkann. The Crusaders were formed to defend the duke, led by the duke's son, Korox, and his friends, including Purdon and several others. The [[Adventurer|adventuring]] party successfully stopped no fewer than four attempts to murder Duke Morkann, though they never were able to link the assassination attempts definitively back to the Duke of Dusk.

After the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], the Crusaders continued to protect the new monarchy of Erlkazar for many years. When King Valon Morkann died in  the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Korox was made king in his father's stead, and Korox quickly appointed Purdun and his other companions from the Crusaders as barons over the lands of Erlkazar. Purdun "the Firefist" was made into the ruler of Ahlarkhem.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Purdun was joined by [[Liam (rebel)|Liam]] and [[Ryder]] in defending [[Zerith Hold]] from the [[vampire]]ss [[Shyressa]] of the [[Twisted Rune]].
