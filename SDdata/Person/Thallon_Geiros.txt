'''Thallon Geiros''' was a [[Tyrran]] high [[priest]] in the city-state of [[Saelmur]], in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faer√ªn]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Thallon served as the high priest of Saelmur's local temple of Tyr, the [[Hall of High Justice]]. And like Saelmur's other religious leaders, he also served as a member of the city-state's governing council, the [[Councilium of Prelates]].

==History==
Around the 1350's DR, Thallon lost one of their eyes in a battle against a [[Banite]] priest.

Two decades later in [[1370 DR]], Thallon was of the same mind as his fellow Prelate [[Athelstan Meiados]] when it came to the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]], an order of Banite [[crusader]]s that had conquered the nearby cities of [[Mintar]] and [[Kzelter]] in [[1362 DR]] and 1370 DR respectively.<ref> The two believed that the Knights' forces waging war with Saelmur was inevitable, but unlike Athelstan he had no desire to rush into war with them. Thallon felt that without outside aid the Saelmurrans had no chance of standing against the Banites. He hoped to gain the aid of [[Tethyr]] and the [[Ala-min]] tribe in this endeavor, with the latter being seen as a good counter to the heavy cavalry of the Knights.
