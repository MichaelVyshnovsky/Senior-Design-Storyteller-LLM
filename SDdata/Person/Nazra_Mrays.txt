Nazra Mrays was a noblewoman, socialite, and a Masked Lord of Waterdeep of the late 15 century DR.
Although she appeared to be a typical frivolous Waterdavian noble, she was actually an extremely shrewd gatherer of information. Dagult Neverember entrusted the safekeeping of the dragonstaff to Nazra.
In 1479 DR, the green dragon Andareunarthex attempted to extort the dragonstaff from Nazra by kidnapping her young son. The dragons plans were foiled by a young wizard named Tennora Hedare and Clytemorrenestrix, a blue dragon changed by Spellplague into a human woman.
