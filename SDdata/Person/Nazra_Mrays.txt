'''Nazra Mrays''' was a noblewoman, socialite, and a Masked Lord of [[Waterdeep]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Although she appeared to be a typical frivolous Waterdavian noble, she was actually an extremely shrewd gatherer of information. [[Dagult Neverember]] entrusted the safekeeping of the ''[[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon|dragonstaff]]'' to Nazra.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], the [[green dragon]] [[Andareunarthex]] attempted to extort the ''dragonstaff'' from Nazra by kidnapping her young son. The dragon's plans were foiled by a young wizard named [[Tennora Hedare]] and [[Clytemorrenestrix]], a [[blue dragon]] changed by [[Spellplague]] into a [[human]] woman.
