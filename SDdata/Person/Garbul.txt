Garbul was a hobgoblin warlord in 1489 DR. Garbul was the leader of the Zartruss hobgoblin tribe living in Kryptgarden Forest and the primary agent of the great dragon Claugiyliamatar.
It was his duty to mediate between the old and the new factions of the Cult of the Dragon, both seeking an alliance with his master.
At last, he decided to ally with the leader of the new faction, Alandra. However, an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones, who had previously destroyed most of hobgoblin strongholds in the forest, attacked the Zartrusss main camp and Garbul was killed in the fighting.
Garbul possessed the Green Dragons Mask, once part of his masters hoard but sold it to Alandra, who sent it to Neronvain.
