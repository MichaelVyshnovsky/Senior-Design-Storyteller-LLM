}}'''Garbul''' was a [[hobgoblin]] warlord in [[1489 DR]]. Garbul was the leader of the [[Zartruss]] hobgoblin tribe living in [[Kryptgarden Forest]] and the primary agent of the great dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]].

==History==
It was his duty to mediate between the old and the new factions of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], both seeking an alliance with his master.

At last, he decided to ally with the leader of the new faction, [[Alandra]].{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|26}} However, an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones, who had previously destroyed most of hobgoblin strongholds in the forest, attacked the Zartruss's main camp and Garbul was killed in the fighting.

==Possessions==
Garbul possessed the [[Green Dragon's Mask]], once part of his master's hoard{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|12}} but sold it to Alandra, who sent it to [[Neronvain]].{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|50-51}}
