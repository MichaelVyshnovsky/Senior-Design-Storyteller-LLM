Lurdas Jasperstone was a member of the Glass-breakers on the Great Spire of the Ice Sea during the midâ€“14th century DR.
Lurdas believed that all of Toril would be immersed in fire, and the greater glory of Gond, if the tower on the island being constructed by a cult of Gond was completed.
Lurdas led missions against the cultists, doing anything within his power to harm the tower or harass their daily work.
