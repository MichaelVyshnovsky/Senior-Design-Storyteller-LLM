        "History": "Jatham was a very able weaver in High Dale. When in [[1358 DR]] a secret [[Zhent]] occupation army occupied the dale, Jatham was a member of the [[Council of the High Dale]]. Constable [[Heladar Longspear]] believed him a pest and far wiser than he pretended to be. In truth Jatham, not wanting a dale ruled by the [[Zhentarim]], secretly used his [[spells]] to help [[Elminster]] and [[Sharantyr]] went unnoticed by the Zhent."
