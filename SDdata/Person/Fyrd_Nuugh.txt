'''Fyrd Nuugh''' was a criminal who worked against the infamous [[The Guild|Guild]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Plenty to do and see in the Gate. No need to barge in on a private chat. Go on, away with you.''|Beulla Sandfoot}}

==Description==
Fyrd was a large [[half-orc]] with brownish tanned hide, aquamarine eyes, and and a good head of straight well-groomed strawberry blonde hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fyrd Nuugh could be found with his co-conspirator, the [[hin]] woman named [[Beulla Sandfoot]] in the Lower City near one of the docks. Their meeting place was a seaside gazebo, where the duo discussed the Guild and [[Nine-Fingers Keene]] while pretending to simply chat about the weather if unwelcome listeners were near.
