'''Bokasin''' was the precept of the settlement of [[Rauthgor]] in northern [[Mulhorand]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Bokasin was a [[warrior]] and [[priest]] in service to [[Anhur]]. His position in Rauthgor was precarious as he was threatened by pirates and [[sahuagin]]. The post was typically given to an enemy Mulhorand's vizier wished to have conveniently eliminated, but Bokasin felt it prudent to have an Anhurite holding the position regardless of the danger. His fellow Anhurites spent a small fortune improving the fortifications in Rauthgor to ensure his safety.
