Jeremmer Hardree, nicknamed "the Mad Jester", was the court fool to two kings and a queen of the city-state of Ormpur on the edge of Lapaliiya in southwest Faer√ªn in the 13 and early 14 centuries DR.
Jeremmer was known for his bold tongue, daring to speak and risk even his life where others would keep quiet. For this, he was called the Mad Jester.
In his time, Jeremmer served High Suikh (king) Naether and then High Suikh Askulder.
On Kythorn 12 in the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR, Chansreena (princess) Maerildarraine murdered her foster father High Suikh Askulder. She seized the throne and declared herself Queen of Ormpur, then led her loyal knights to plunder and burn the royal temple of Tiamat, but the flames spread through the city. This outrageous act triggered a holy war and, by the end of the day, hundreds lay dead. To Ormpurrans, this shocking day would be known forever afterward as "Bloodsword". At Torch Court at the end of this day, Jeremmer alone dared quip to the still wounded and enraged queen, and kept his life. He continued to serve the usurping queen.
Eventually, Queen Maerildarraine was deposed by Helbareim "the Storm Wind" Alanasker, who was supported by the church of Tiamat. Jeremmer was grievously wounded defending her, but survived in the care of priests, while Maerildarraine died fighting in her own throne room. Helbareim then became High Suikh himself.
Despite bitter arguments, there was much affection and closeness between Jeremmer and Queen Maerildarraine (in Elminsters consideration).
Jeremmer Hardrees jests were recorded in What Came Out of My Mouth Too Swiftly.
