'''Xedac''' was a young [[vampire]] agent of the [[Twisted Rune]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Activities==
Xedac lead a pack of [[ghoul]]s and [[ghast]]s in performing various tasks for the Runemasters.

==History==
Xedac and his team had performed many missions for the Twisted Rune and he was destroyed several times.

In 1375 DR, the Runemasters sent Xedac and his team via a powerful ''[[teleport]]'' [[spell]] into [[Undermountain]] in order to recover the lost [[runestone]] created by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] just before his sudden death.

==Personality==
Xedac had become a successful [[undead]] and appreciated the powers granted by his condition. He did not care for his destruction, knowing his masters would soon resurrect him if the worst happened. Xedac preferred fighting using his sword.
