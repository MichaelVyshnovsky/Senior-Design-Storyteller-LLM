'''Kled''' was an emotionally broken [[hobgoblin]] member of the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Make the hag go away. Kled can't take any more redcaps. Can't.''|Kled}}

==Description==
Kled was a tall and masculine hobgoblin fighter with a red skin tone.

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Kled encountered a [[hag]] and that encounter left him broken and terrified of [[red cap]]s. Eventually, Kled met other hag victims, including [[Adrielle]], [[Jatlo]], and, possibly, were they to survive their encounters with [[Auntie Ethel]], [[Hydrangea Wubb]], [[Mayrina]], and her [[zombified]] husband [[Connor Vinderblad]]. This group, which later became known as the Anti-Hag Support Group, found their way to the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, where they began planning and researching ways to end the hag menace.

Soon after, the [[green hag]] Auntie Ethel discovered the group working to save girls consumed by the hags as a method of procreation. It was revealed that Jatlo was not a [[dragonborn]] survivor but a shapeshifted red cap servant of the green hag. Secretly, Jatlo had smuggled an ''[[effigy]]'' into the Anti-Hag Support Group's hideout, old [[Garlow]]'s home in the [[Lower City]]. That ''effigy'' affected Mayrina, turning her into a [[sheep]].
