Kled was an emotionally broken hobgoblin member of the Anti-Hag Support Group of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Kled was a tall and masculine hobgoblin fighter with a red skin tone.
At some point before the , Kled encountered a hag and that encounter left him broken and terrified of red caps. Eventually, Kled met other hag victims, including Adrielle, Jatlo, and, possibly, were they to survive their encounters with Auntie Ethel, Hydrangea Wubb, Mayrina, and her zombified husband Connor Vinderblad. This group, which later became known as the Anti-Hag Support Group, found their way to the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, where they began planning and researching ways to end the hag menace.
Soon after, the green hag Auntie Ethel discovered the group working to save girls consumed by the hags as a method of procreation. It was revealed that Jatlo was not a dragonborn survivor but a shapeshifted red cap servant of the green hag. Secretly, Jatlo had smuggled an effigy into the Anti-Hag Support Groups hideout, old Garlows home in the Lower City. That effigy affected Mayrina, turning her into a sheep.
