Brother Chaunticleer was a brother at the Edificant Library who sung the Canticle of Deneir at mid-day every day.
During the Chaos Curse, he momentarily forgot the words while thinking of fishing, and that proved to Cadderly Bonaduce that something was terribly wrong with the library.
When Cadderly finally returned to a doomed and desecrated library, he eventually found Chaunticleer in his room, which he had warded against vampires so Kierkan Rufo and his zombie and vampire lackeys could not enter.
