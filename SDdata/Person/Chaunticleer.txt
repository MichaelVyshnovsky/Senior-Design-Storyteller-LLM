}}Brother '''Chaunticleer''' was a brother at the [[Edificant Library]] who sung the Canticle of [[Deneir]] at mid-day every day.<ref>

==Activities==
During the [[Chaos Curse]], he momentarily forgot the words while thinking of fishing, and that proved to [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] that something was terribly wrong with the library.<ref>

When Cadderly finally returned to a doomed and desecrated library, he eventually found Chaunticleer in his room, which he had warded against [[vampire]]s so [[Kierkan Rufo]] and his [[zombie]] and vampire lackeys could not enter.<ref>
