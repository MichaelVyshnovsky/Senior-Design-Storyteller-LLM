Elasha Evanara was a gold elf cleric of Labelas Enoreth, a member of House Evanara and a librarian in Evermeet in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Elasha was small of stature.
Elasha took care of the extensive library of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower.
Elasha loved knowledge and books and always possessed an aura of peace, wisdom, and reassurance. Elasha had a deep understanding and adoration for the elven gods and their teachings, acquired after hundreds of years of research and contemplation.
Amlaruil counted Elasha as a true friend. Often, the queen asked for Elashas wisdom and comfort while she grieved.
The librarian was known to have a dagger.
