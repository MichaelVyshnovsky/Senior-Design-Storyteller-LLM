'''The Bonebreaker''' was a particularly large and powerful [[skeleton]] who dwelt in the [[Frostsilver Mines]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Bonebreaker commanded an army of skeletons that blocked the passages leading from the upper levels of Frostilver Mines into the rich depths. It was given its ominous name by members of the [[Burntbone Horde]], whose efforts to pillage the Mines in the late 15{{th}} century DR were stymied by The Bonebreaker and its army.

Upon learning of this skeleton army, [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]] of [[Waterdeep]] determined that it was too dangerous to have such a large force of [[undead]] so near to her city, and so she ordered [[adventurers]] to destroy The Bonebreaker. While this apparently caused the army to collapse, many of the skeletons went on to find their way to the surface.
