}}'''Liam Thistledown''' was a [[human]] child, and the first human encountered by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].

==Description==
Liam was the youngest child of the [[Thistledown (family)|Thistledown]] family, and was somewhat mischievous. He had light brown hair and eyes, with several freckles.

==History==
In the midâ€”14{{th}} century [[DR]], Liam ventured out of the farming household, slacking from his chores. Drizzt's [[panther]], [[Guenhwyvar]], started for the child, but the dark elf stopped her. Later, Drizzt approached the child, and explained his name, whilst pointing to himself. The child screamed in fear, "Help, it's a drizzit!", and ran back home to tell his family. Some of his folk, curious, ventured out with him. They too eventually met, and were scared off, by the [[drow]] renegade.

Unfortunately, the Thistledown household was raided by the [[barghest]] [[Ulgulu]], who murdered every family member, including young Liam.
