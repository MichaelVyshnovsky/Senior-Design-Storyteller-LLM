Urda Malo was a baker who lived in the village of Eveningstar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Urda was a thin, tall, and gruff woman who seemed never to gain weight despite eating and drinking excessively.
Urda ran the Eveningstar Bakery located along the High Road near the center of the village. Her daughters helped run the bakery.
Urda Malo was an orphan from Riatavin in Amn. Eventually, she settled in Eveningstar and opened her famous bakery. When she reached her frail twilight years, Urda hired a small army of local women to be her live-in assistants. When Urda became senile, the women completely took over the bakery but continued to care for the old woman until her death of winterchill fever. These assistants continued operating Eveningstar Bakery, and as of the late-15 century DR, their children continued Urda Malos legacy of making superb bread.
