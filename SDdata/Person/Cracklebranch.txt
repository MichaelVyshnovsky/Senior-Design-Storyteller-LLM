'''Cracklebranch''' was a particularly massive [[giant spider]] that dwelt deep within [[Forestfall Fen]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Aside from being deadly [[poison|venomous]], Cracklebranch was one of a breed of giant spiders native to the Fen that was notable for their tough, almost wooden carapaces that encompassed their bodies and legs.

==History==
Cracklebranch was slain in the late 15{{th}} century DR by a group of [[adventurer]]s who had been sent to investigate Forestfall Fen on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]]. Upon being slain, its carapace cracked with the sound of splintering logs so loudly as to echo through the swamp and alert other monsters to the adventurers' presence.
