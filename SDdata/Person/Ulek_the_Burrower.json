        "mainbody": "'''Ulek the Burrower''' was a [[goblin]] sapper who served the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved teleporting a troop of goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. A group of goblin sappers made it into the basement of one of the warehouses in the docks, led by [[Ulek the Burrower]]. Once inside, a goblin leader named [[Rukwurm]], used a magic [[scroll]] provided by [[Phaen of the Rags]] that transported more goblins into Targos. Eventually, a group of adventurers from [[Luskan]] discovered the collapsed smugglers' tunnels and disposed of both goblin leaders while slaughtering their marauding troops."
