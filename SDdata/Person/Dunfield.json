        "mainbody": "Captain Dunfield was a mercenary officer who operated throughout the Sword Coast region of the North during the late 15 century DR.\nDunfield was considered a hardened and distrusting man who was somehow able to remain honorable during the difficult times in which he lived. He always did his best by the soldiers under his command and strived to serve the community at large.\nHe had a long-standing relationship with Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter.\nAfter Lord Neverember started the New Neverwinter movement and rose to power in Neverwinter during the 1470s DR, he appointed Dunfield as captain of the town guard of Helms Hold and made the official decree of Protectors Law, stating that all spellscarred residents of the city would be sent to the Hold for treatment. While Captain Dunfield kept the peace in the Helmite city a new prophet of the Watcher named Rohini rose to great acclaim for her treatment of the unfortunate spellscarred. Some time before the , Rohini revealed herself as a succubus and the leader of the devil-worshiping Ashmadai. She gathered her Ashmadai cult followers and drove Dunfield and his soldiers out from the city, forcing them to regroup elsewhere.\nCaptain Dunfield rallied what soldiers and mercenaries he had at a small camp outside Helms Hold, known as the Last Redoubt. They built siege weapons and marched on the city, initiating the Siege of Helms Hold. In response, the Prophet Rohini and her cultists summoned scores of devils from the Nine Hells and rebuffed the assault, keeping Dunfield and the soldiers of the Neverwinter Guard out of the city.\nAfter seeking aid from Sergeant Knox in Neverwinter, Captain Dunfield worked with some adventurers, including the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge, to reclaim Helms Hold. He directed them to slay the imps, legion devils and hellfire warlocks that roamed the battlefield, and then rally with the beleaguered Brother Satarin stuck in the city."
