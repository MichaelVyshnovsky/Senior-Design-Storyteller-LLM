        "mainbody": "racklebranch was a particularly massive giant spider that dwelt deep within Forestfall Fen in the late 15 century DR.\nAside from being deadly venomous, Cracklebranch was one of a breed of giant spiders native to the Fen that was notable for their tough, almost wooden carapaces that encompassed their bodies and legs.\nCracklebranch was slain in the late 15 century DR by a group of adventurers who had been sent to investigate Forestfall Fen on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep. Upon being slain, its carapace cracked with the sound of splintering logs so loudly as to echo through the swamp and alert other monsters to the adventurers presence."
