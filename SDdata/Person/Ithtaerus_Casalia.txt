'''Ithtaerus Casalia''' was a [[Calishite]] [[mage]] that lived during the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He kept a journal of his plans and deeds. It was still partially intact as of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

==Activities==
Ithtaerus was known to have been working on some experiments in the field of [[necromancy]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1290}}, Ithtaerus schemed to steal the hoard and clutch of eggs that lay within the lair of the [[copper dragon]] [[Halatathlaer]], beneath [[Dragonspear Castle]]. He placed the dragon under a [[magic]]ally induced sleep and ''[[teleport]]ed'' him far away from the castle. Ithtaerus then created a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Nine Hells]] and tricked the dragon's companion, [[Daeros Dragonspear]], to travel through the portal. In doing so, Daeros opened a passageway to [[Avernus]] and let loose a horde of [[fiend]]s upon [[Toril]].

While the castle was being overrun, Ithtaerus hid Halatathler's eggs away in a cave near the [[Nepenthe River]], in order to later experiment on the [[wyrmling]]s. He then ''teleported'' Halatathlaer back to the castle and summoned three other [[dragon|dragons]] to rend the slumbering creature to pieces. 

Ithtaerus then went to the top of Dragonspear Castle to enjoy a fine [[wine]] and celebrate his plan come to fruition. Unfortunately, the young [[black dragon]] [[Sharndrel]] was displeased with having been summoned and not finding the full hoard of the dead copper dragon. Sharndrel let loose a jet of acid that disintegrated Ithtaerus and made his plan all for naught.

==Rumors & Legends==
The mage's actions at the castle were chronicled in the book, ''[[A Historical Treatise of Dragonspear Castle]]''.
