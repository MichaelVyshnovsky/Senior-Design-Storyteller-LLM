        "mainbody": "Angah Lalla was a curios dealer and fence for stolen goods in the city of Scornubel.\nAngah dressed in flowing off-white robes with a black veil. He wore a large gold rune-engraved amulet of protection +2 around his neck. His long black hair was braided and tied with off-white cloth. He spoke in a hoarse whisper.\nThere were rumours that Angah was from the lands east of Thay and Rashemen or Zhakar, mostly perpetuated by his dress sense and his reluctance to show his face.\nAngah was actually a character invented by a married couple, Aareem and Leila, who came to Scornubel from Sembia after angering a powerful prince. One half of the team was usually out collecting information while the other stayed behind in the shop. Aareem and Leila were both in their forties with a teenaged daughter named Ezther, who also began assuming the guise of Angah.\nAngahs shop was near the center of Scornubel and appeared large from the outside, but it was dimly lit with maze-like shelving arrangements within. The contents of the shop consisted of weapons, books, scrolls, armor, and other knick-knacks. There was a thick smell of incense inside. A hidden door operated within the shop.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryFences\nCategoryInhabitants of Scornubel\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nkm9s3vjrupbfb2bij10k0hqark54a1a"
