'''Lanar''' was a miner who lived in [[Phandalin]].

==Description==
The miner frequented Phandalin's main inn, the [[Stonehill Inn]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} Lanar came across information that [[orc]] raiders had been seen close to the village. The leader of the town, [[Harbin Wester]], was looking for a group to take them out, and Lanar may have told adventurers about this opportunity.
