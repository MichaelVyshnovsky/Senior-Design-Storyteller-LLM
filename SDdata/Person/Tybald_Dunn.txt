{{quote|''Yes, well, it hurts when honest labor brings you less in the world than those who exploit an opportunity.''|Tybald Dunn}}

==Description==
Tybald was a [[human]] male with light skin and dark brown hair. He was strict with his willful daughter, threatening her with a [[birch]] stick if she did not show up to help with barrel-crafting.

==Possessions==
Tybald owned a pair of [[enchanted]] ''[[boots of the north]]''.

==History==
Tybald Dunn married to Ambere a number of years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}} somewhere south of Icewind Dale. The cooper promised her a "bright new future" and the couple moved to the cold frontier town of Lonelywood. By [[1281 DR]], Tybald Dunn and Ambere had a hellion of a daughter, and the wife grew unhappy and resentful of her family for being trapped in the frozen backwater of the north. During [[Baldemar Thurlow]]'s reign as the speaker of Lonelywood, he and Tybald had a strained relationship. Tybald thought the speaker to be an opportunist who was bad at bargaining and politics, and in turn, for voicing criticism, Baldemar threatened the cooper with withholding caravan contracts. But even without being cut off, speaker Thurlow tossed only scraps, making Tybald's life a struggle. He did do some business with the locals. One of Tybald's customers was [[Kieran Nye]], the owner and bartender of the [[Whistling Gallows]] inn for whom the cooper constructed wooden kegs.
