        "Description": "Gan wore what appeared to be a bandage over his left eye.",
        "History": "Elturian tieflings were made refugees following the catastrophe known as [[the Descent]] that befell the city in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. They were blamed for Elturel's temporary displacement into [[Avernus]], even though they had no association with the [[Nine Hells]] beyond their infernal heritage. Not even children like Gan and the others were spared this unfortunate mistreatment.\n\nTraveling westward along the [[Risen Road]], the tieflings were beset by [[goblin]]s and forced to take refuge at the [[Emerald Grove]]. [[Asharak]] and the local hero [[Wyll]], the Blade of Frontiers, spent their time training some of the tieflings to better defend themselves. Even children like Gan were included in this combat training. In fact, Gan was particularly enthusiastic about it."
