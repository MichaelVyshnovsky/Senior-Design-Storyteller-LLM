'''Bertio''' was a member of the [[Dead Rats]] gang in [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century.

==History==
Around [[1490 DR]], [[Titus Minton]] introduced the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] to Bertio, who had been poisoned by [[Bregan D'aerthe]] and became a ravenous beast from the madness. With ingredients procured by the Champion from [[Aleema Meddlebrook]] and [[Miranda]], Bertio was cured.
