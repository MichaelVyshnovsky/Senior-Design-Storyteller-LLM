Bertio was a member of the Dead Rats gang in Luskan in the late 15 century.
Around 1490 DR, Titus Minton introduced the Champion of the Burning Dawn to Bertio, who had been poisoned by Bregan Daerthe and became a ravenous beast from the madness. With ingredients procured by the Champion from Aleema Meddlebrook and Miranda, Bertio was cured.
