        "History": "In 1379 DR, Valena went to a park where she met [[Malen Dharran]]. They talked for a time and then Malen proposed to accompany Valena to her house and she accepted. However, during the walk, they were ambushed by a group of [[Unyielding Sword]] mercenaries hired by the slaver [[Lanador]]. The mercenaries killed Malen and tried to kidnap Valena. Luckily a nearby adventuring party heard the screams of Valena and managed to save her.[[Derek Myers]]. \"Eyes on the Ball.\" ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206.
