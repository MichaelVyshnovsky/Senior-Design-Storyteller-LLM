'''Martil''' was one of the inhabitants of [[Gillian's Hill]], a small hamlet on the [[Trade Way]].

==History==
Martil died some time before [[1372 DR]]. His gravestone was located on the northern edge of the Gillian's Hill Graveyard. Ironically enough, he was buried right next to the person whom he killed and was killed by, [[Eldid]].
