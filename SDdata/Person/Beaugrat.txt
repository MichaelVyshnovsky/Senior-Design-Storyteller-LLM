Beaugrat was a barbarian and a member of the Peacekeepers and the Order of Blue Flame.
He was of heavy build, although he wasnt much taller than an average human.
He had a reputation of being a brawler and a bully.
Beaugrat was an associate of Duvan and traveled with him to the edge of the Underchasm to retrieve a valuable spellbook for Tyrangal.  Beaugrat was secretly working for the Order of Blue Flame and betrayed Duvan and tried to steal the book.  Later, Beaugrat helped the Order capture Duvan for experimentation.  Beaugrat was killed by the monk Slanya when she and others from her order rescued Duvan.	
Beaugrats spellscar allows him to project blue flames from his hands.
Beaugrat wore plate mail that had a custom-crafted gap in the right pauldron to show his deep and jagged spellscar.  He used a huge two-handed sword and wore steel spiked gauntlets.
