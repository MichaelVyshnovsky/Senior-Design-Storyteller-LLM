Novice '''Crusher''' was a [[goblin]] member of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] who dwelled within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]..

{{Quote|...thrashed 'is arm with by bare hands. Weaker than pixies, humans.|Crusher.}}

==Description==
[[File:Crusher, mark.png|thumb|right|250px|''Crusher bearing his mark of the Absolute''.]]
Crusher had long brown hair that was decorated with fangs and bones, and he wore heavy [[armor]]. One of his ears was torn off and his face appeared to be badly scarred or burned. He was generally considered to be stronger than many other goblins within the Shattered Sanctum.

Like other novices of his goddess, Crusher bore the ''[[mark of the Absolute]]''.

==Personality==
The goblin warrior hoped to be made the next of the Absolute's [[True Soul]]s. He secretly hated [[Dror Ragzlin]], [[Minthara Baenre]], and Priestess [[Gut]], and would kick them out of the cult if he had any amount of influence within the order.

==Possessions==
He fought with a large spiked [[club]] and wore a [[Crusher's ring|magical ring]] set upon one of his filthy toes. Crusher also wore a necklace depicted with an interesting combination of three symbols: a triangle, a skull (that covered the triangle), and a crude black object with about five digits (painted on the skull).<ref group="note">These symbols could potentially represent the [[Dead Three]]: the triangle for [[Myrkul]], the skull for [[Bhaal]], and the black hand for [[Bane]].

==History==
In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Crusher killed a [[human]] during the cult's raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] in. To celebrate, he got drunk and boasted about his achievement. Since joining the Cult of the Absolute, he believed that things were changing for the better.
