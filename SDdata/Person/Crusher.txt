Crusher had long brown hair that was decorated with fangs and bones, and he wore heavy armor. One of his ears was torn off and his face appeared to be badly scarred or burned. He was generally considered to be stronger than many other goblins within the Shattered Sanctum.
Like other novices of his goddess, Crusher bore the mark of the Absolute.
The goblin warrior hoped to be made the next of the Absolutes True Souls. He secretly hated Dror Ragzlin, Minthara Baenre, and Priestess Gut, and would kick them out of the cult if he had any amount of influence within the order.
He fought with a large spiked club and wore a magical ring set upon one of his filthy toes. Crusher also wore a necklace depicted with an interesting combination of three symbols a triangle, a skull (that covered the triangle), and a crude black object with about five digits (painted on the skull).These symbols could potentially represent the Dead Three the triangle for Myrkul, the skull for Bhaal, and the black hand for Bane.
In the 15 century DR, Crusher killed a human during the cults raid on the Waukeens Rest in. To celebrate, he got drunk and boasted about his achievement. Since joining the Cult of the Absolute, he believed that things were changing for the better.
