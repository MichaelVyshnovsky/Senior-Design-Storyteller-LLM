'''Jui-jung Nu Nam''' was a traveling cook in [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], at the [[komite]] in [[Suijeng]], Jui-jung Nu Nam sold his noodle soup to visitors, claiming that his was the best soup in all Shou Lung. In truth, his soup was terrible but Jui-jung believed that customers lacked taste.
