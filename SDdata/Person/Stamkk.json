        "mainbody": "tamkk was a male bugbear who ran the kitchen in the Coliseum of Maerimydra for Kurgoth Hellspawn.\nA bugbear of some stature, Stamkk was armed with an array of cleavers and kitchen knives.\nStamkk was an especially cowardly bugbear for his size, despite his outward appearance as a bully he was not above fleeing as soon as he felt threatened.\nA passable chef, Stamkk could run a kitchen well enough to feed numerous fire giants. \nAs the boss of a large kitchen, Stamkk had access to all manner of kitchen implements and utensils.\nStamkk was a brutal with the goblins who helped him run his kitchen but conversely they would stick with the bugbear wherever he ran.\nIn 1372 DR, the half-fiend fire giant Kurgoth Hellspawn invaded Maerimydra and made the Coliseum (Maerimydra) there his home. To feed his giant-sized appetite, Kurgoth conscripted Stamkk and a few goblins to prepare meals for him."
