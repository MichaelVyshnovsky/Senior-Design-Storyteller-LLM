        "mainbody": "'''Lord Chess''' was the ineffectual overlord of [[Zhentil Keep]] from at least the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]] until his death around the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Chess was a gluttonous, corpulent man who was vainly fastidious in manner and dress. A coward at heart, he was prone to gossip and being self-important.\n\nHe did have a fine taste for wine however and particularly enjoyed a fine vintage from [[Mulhorand]].",
        "Abilities": "Chess started training as a [[cleric]], switched to studying [[magic]], then gave that up to be trained in the martial arts. He did not attain mastery of any of these professions.",
        "Possessions": "As another means to protect his hide, Chess wore a [[magic]]al ring that could apparently summon a [[dragon]] to his aid upon request.",
        "Relationships": "{{Quote|I was close with Chess once, and can be again...close enough, at least, to make him move at our bidding.|[[Manshoon]].}}\n\nChess was highly untrusting of [[Manshoon]] and his secretive [[Zhentarim]], fearing his close connection with the [[church of Bane]] via [[Fzoul Chembryl]], as well as his association with aberrant [[beholder]]s.\n\nOver time, the [[Zhentarim]] kept Chess in his position of overlord of the Keep because he was easy to manipulate and provided diplomatic cover for their operations. The enemies of the Zhents didn't want him to be removed for fear of someone actually competent taking his place and expanding the Zhent influence. Being cowardly and fearful of attack or assassination, he hired a small squad of five bodyguards to accompany him whenever necessary.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1334}}, Chess demonstrated uncharacteristic bravery when he openly spoke against a vote that would grant First Lord Manshoon complete military power of Zhentil Keep during a meeting of the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]] at [[High Hall (Zhentil Keep)|High Hall]]. The meeting was derailed when a terrific battle broke out between Chess' summoned dragon and Manshoon's beholders. The vote appeared to turn in Manshoon's favor when the [[elder orb]] [[Arglath]] emerged as the victor. The tables were turned when Arglath (who was actually the [[mage]] [[Elminster]] in disguise) threatened Manshoon to stop his schemes and abuse of magic. After the vote turned against Manshoon, Lord Chess was named \"Watchlord\" and given special directorship over the Council of Lords.\n\nWhen the [[avatar]] of [[Bane]] arrived on [[Faer√ªn]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Lord Chess became the ostensible but ultimately powerless ruler of Zhentil Keep. Bane however held the true power at the city's [[Black Altar]], directing Chess to carry out his will for the \"good\" of the Zhent citizens. When Bane's avatar was seemingly destroyed during the [[second battle of Shadowdale]], Chess loyalists cried out that he should be made ruler of Zhentil Keep in earnest. Chess' political ideals quickly put down when Bane returned to Zhentil Keep in the body of his most loyal priest and [[chosen]], Fzoul Chembryl.\n\nLord Chess was double-crossed by [[Mask]] during his bid to trap [[Kezef]] the Chaos Hound, which resulted in Chess' death.\n\nChess' estate was located in the north section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]]."
