        "mainbody": "Ifan Talroa () was one of the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru, Chult during the late 15 century DR. He held a monopoly over the sale of live beasts within the city.\nHe was a Chultan nobleman who carried a heavy staff that he could bang on the ground for emphasis.\nHe was known for being exceptionally avaricious in his dealings. He was prone to arrogance, jealousy, distrust, and scheming.\nIfan Talroa dealt in all manner of domesticated and near-wild animals native to Chult, from adorable pets and companions to beasts of burden and mounts. Anyone wishing to buy or sell such a creature, or to have such creatures trained, had to go through him or his sellers.Although Ifan Talroa controlled the sale of mounts and beasts of burden, the sale of riding tack such as saddles was controlled by a different merchant prince, Ekene-Afa. Among the creatures that Ifan sold were flying monkeys, giant lizards, and even dinosaurs (most notably ankylosaurus, deinonychus, hadrosaurus, and triceratops). He also sold flying snakes, but only to his allies. As he held a monopoly on the beast trade, there were no other legal means to sell such animals.\nHis dozens of beast merchants and handlers throughout Port Nyanzaru also acted as his spies, allowing his eyes and ears to infest every marketplace in the city. As part of his monopoly, he implicitly controlled the dinosaur pens in Port Nyanzarus Tiryki Anchorage.\nAs a merchant prince, Ifan Talroa participated in their council that governed Port Nyanzaru from the palace of Goldenthrone. He was known to have forced adventurers to prove themselves in single combat against a dinosaur right in the middle of the palace.\nIfan Talroa maintained a palatial and opulent villa in Port Nyanzaru, which also served as a secure fortress for him and his business. The villa and gardens were home to colorful flying snakes and were decorated with Chultan relics and vases taken from tombs within the jungle. Ifan was a collector of such ancient Chultan relics, and desired to acquire more treasures (such as the Skull Chalice of Chgakare). He was not above marking someone for death if they refused to give him something he wanted for this collection.\nIfan also maintained a secret office in a bunker beneath the dinosaur pens in Tiryki Anchorage. From here, he personally handled communications with his less savory allies in the jungle. He protected such secrets with summoned shadows and shadow demons.\nHe was considered an ally of the Zhentarim and surrounded himself with dangerous and influential agents from the mercenary organization. They collaborated in many of his schemes.\nHe also acted as a spy of sorts for the yuan-ti of Omu, although he maintained plausible deniability by never confirming exactly with whom he was working. He used his flying snakes to give them warning of any approaching interlopers searching for Chultan treasure. Because of this arrangement, the Emerald Enclave came to suspect Ifan of luring unsuspecting travelers to their deaths in the jungle. One of their agents, Screaming Wind, sought to expose him as a traitor to Port Nyanzaru.\nAs he was generally distrusting of everyone he met, Ifan had no true friends, family or meaningful relationships. He was jealous of fellow merchant princes Ekene-Afa for her fame and Wakanga Otamu for his arcane power.\nLike the other merchant princes, the Ytepka Society supported him as part of their mission to ensure stability in Port Nyanzaru, although he was also willing to use them to pursue his more selfish goals.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Ifan Talroa was one of the wealthiest individuals in Port Nyanzaru.\nWhen Port Nyanzaru became overrun with the fiendish forces of the pirate captain Idrianne Smoke, Ifan Talroa devised a plan to unleash the many dinosaurs locked up in the the citys dinosaur pens to let them rampage through the enemy forces. He was delighted to be the only person with the power to authorize such a plan."
