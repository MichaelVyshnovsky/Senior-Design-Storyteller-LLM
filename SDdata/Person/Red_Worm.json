        "mainbody": "'''The Red Worm''' was a [[Half-dragon|half]]-[[red dragon]] half-[[remorhaz]] of enormous size who had been chosen to be a guardian of the [[portal]] in [[Choshein]].",
        "Description": "The Red Worm had streaks of red running along his otherwise white body, indicative of his draconic heritage. Likewise, his head was a strange mixture of draconic and insectiod features; he bore both frills and horns.\n\nThe Red Worm was not a mindless monster; his draconic parentage gave him more intelligence than the typical remorhaz. He was fully capable of devising shrewd attacks, and he was smart enough to suspect that he was guarding a portal of some sort, though he did not know why.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to the abilities of a typical remorhaz, as a half-red dragon, the Red Worm could breath fire approximately once a day and was immune to fire, paralysis, and magical sleep effects.",
        "History": "The Red Worm was the spawn of an eccentric female red dragon named [[Icindallix]], whose eggs were fertilized by an especially large male remorhaz. She laired in the caverns where Choshein once stood.\n\nThe Red Worm eventually grew powerful enough to slay and consume his sire. He was then chosen by the [[Prince of Jhothûn]] to guard the portal in Choshein.\n\nSome time in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Shadovar]] sent an expedition to explore the ancient [[Netheril|Netherese]] colony that once occupied Choshein's cavern. The Red Worm slew them all and left no survivors.\n\nAfter this incident, however, the Red Worm grew nervous and would not leave the cave, even to hunt. Instead, he received a tribute of sorts of food from other remorhaz in the region.\n\nIt was likely that the Shadovar sent further expeditions to slay the Red Worm, but his ultimate fate is not recorded.",
