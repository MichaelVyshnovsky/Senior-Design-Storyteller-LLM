Dunkin Tallmast was an emissary of Tarnheel Embuirhan, the tyrant of Mintarn.
When the Sea Sprite of Captain Deudermont arrived in Mintarn in search of information about the mythical isle of Caerwich, Dunkins master Tarnheel was intrigued because he knew that on board was Drizzt DoUrden. Drizzt was considered by many to be the best swordsman in the Realms and Tarnheel also wanted this title. He thought this was the perfect occasion to decide the matter. Tarnheel sent Dunkin to Captain Deudermont and he convinced Drizzt to accept the fight.
