'''Rauthlor Grymmund''' was a [[wight]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==History==
Rauthlor was an adventuring warrior and leader of the evil [[Shadow Shields]] adventuring company. Somehow, he acquired the fabled [[Crown of stars (item)|Crown of Stars]].

Around [[1310 DR]], Rauthlor and his fellows went to Myth Drannor and enter the crypt of the [[Symbaern]] family. There they battled the guardian [[baelnorn]] [[Ilrune Symbaern]]. However, duirng the battle, the entrance to the crypt collapsed, killing most of the adventurers. Ilrune recovered the Crown from the bodies.

However, Rauthlor and two of his fellows rose as [[wight]]s and fought Ilrune again and again, trying to recover the Crown.

In 1370 DR, Rauthlor had created some other wights and [[skeleton]]s to help him finally defeat Ilrune.
