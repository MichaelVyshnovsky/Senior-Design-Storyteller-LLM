Ashemmon, also called Ashemmon of Rhymanthiin, was a half-elf sorcerer of Rhymanthiin and the fifth Blackstaff of Waterdeep. Although it is not stated explicitly, Ashemmon was in all likelihood the son of Sememmon and Ashemmi.
Ashemmon wore no beard and had blond hair nearly to the ground. Sigils and runes covered his shoulders and neck. He had hawklike features.
Ashemmon became Blackstaff in Ches of 1424 DR, after the death of Krehlan Arunsun. According to Sarathus Hothemer in his treatise Blackstaves Their History (Year of the Forged Sigil, 1459 DR), Ashemmon outshone all Blackstaffs except Khelben in matters of statecraft.
In his life, Ashemmon mentored Samark Dhanzscul, who became the sixth Blackstaff.
Ashemmon died in the 1464 DR and was succeeded by Samark. Ashemmons spirit-template went on to reside within Blackstaff Tower along with the spirit-templates of the other former Blackstaffs.
