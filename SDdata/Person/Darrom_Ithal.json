Working together for six months, Clan Ithal, six other Tethyrian tribes, and the elves formed an army to retake Ithmong from the Calishites, in what would be called the Second Revolt.\nDuring the battle known as the Ithmong Slaughter, Clovis was slain during the charge against the town, being struck with numerous arrows. breaking through the enemy lies as Ithal Crag. The four brothers of Pasha Kalil were slain in the battle. In fact, the Tethyrians did not leave a single enemy survivor within two miles of the town.

One of the other clan leaders challenged Darrom in a duel and lost the duel and his life.\nClan Bormul, however, was supportive of Chief Darrom, and that powerful clan, together with the Tethir tribe helped strengthen the unity of all the clans. By the , Darrom planned to retake Myratma by making use of the strategic advantages of the surrounding hills.

The court was moved from Ithmong to this new location.\nDarroms reign went smoothly until an incident in the year , when Corins elven wife died in an accident. This triggered diplomatic tensions between the humans and the elves, who demanded \"justice\" against the clan guard who had been guarding her when she was bit by a venomous snake. After six years, the king finally gave in to the tensions and turned over the elderly clansman to the elves, hoping to save the elven alliance, but this, in turn led to strong dissent among the other clans.\nSo strong was the anger over this act, that, in the month of Eleasis of the , Darroms brother-in-law, the now-chieftain of Clan Tarseth, Amir Tarseth I, arranged for a deepspawn to be teleported directly into the throne room.
