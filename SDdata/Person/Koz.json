However, it turned out that the wizard tower was haunted by the ghost of Thalivar. The wizards spirit drove away Koz, Yorrum and two other soldiers (Gori and Erlum). However, the town mage Gallio Elibro refused to leave. The soldiers had recently noticed Gallios odd behavior but they were unaware that Thalivars ghost took possession of the mage every night. A group of adventurers took care of the ghost."
