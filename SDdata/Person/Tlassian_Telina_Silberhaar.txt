Lady '''Tlassian Telina Silberhaar''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]] and the matriarch of [[Clan Tlassian]] in [[1479 DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Death before Dishonor|8}}

==History==
Telina was considered one of the most accomplished military commanders of Tymanther of her time and a successful [[dragon]]-slayer by her peers.

During the elections for the [[Vanquisher]] of the [[1477 DR|1477]] to [[1487 DR]] period, Telina was one of the strongest candidates for the position. However, Telina declined her candidature and supported [[Kepeshkmolik Tarhun]] instead. Telina became the matriarch of her clan afterwards.According to ''[[Ashes of the Tyrant]]'' (page 300), a patriarch or matriarch of a clan cannot be made candidate for the Vanquisher title. That means that Telina became the matriarch of Clan Tlassian after the elections.

Thanks to her leadership, Clan Tlassian soon improved its status in [[Thymari]] society and cemented its ties with the military structure of Tymanther.
