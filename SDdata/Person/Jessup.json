However, during the journey, Jessup claimed to have been bitten by [[Guen]], the girl [[Jaena]]'s dog, and demanded that the dog be put down. However, it was revealed by the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] that Jessup had provoked the dog in a drunken state by trying to force-feed it brandy, and the case was dropped."
