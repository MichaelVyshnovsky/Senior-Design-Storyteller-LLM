The Virushead was a deadly plaguechanged creature that was held captive in Airspur, Akanûl, in the late 15 century DR.
Each day, the Virushead unleashed hundreds of different deadly diseases from its rotting skin and phlegmy exhalations.
The Virushead was born as a consequence of the Spellplague of the . It was later captured by the genasi at great cost in the wilds of Akanûl during the rule of Queen Cyndra, and encapsulated in magical stasis in a hidden earthmote in the city of Airspur. The genasi began to investigate the creature in order to use it as a weapon against the Abolethic Sovereignty, but as it was considered too dangerous it was decided to be held in stasis until there was a great necessity to use it.

Mostly due to Magnols protests, Queen Arathane outlawed any experimentation on the Virushead, forcing Lehaya to resort to study it clandestinely.
