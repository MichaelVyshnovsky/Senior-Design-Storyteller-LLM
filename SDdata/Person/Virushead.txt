The '''Virushead''' was a deadly [[plaguechanged]] creature that was held captive in [[Airspur]], [[Akanûl]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Each day, the Virushead unleashed hundreds of different deadly [[disease]]s from its rotting skin and phlegmy exhalations.

==History==
The Virushead was born as a consequence of the [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. It was later captured by the [[genasi]] at great cost in the wilds of Akanûl during the rule of Queen [[Cyndra]], and encapsulated in magical stasis in a hidden [[earthmote]] in the city of Airspur. The genasi began to investigate the creature in order to use it as a weapon against the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], but as it was considered too dangerous it was decided to be held in stasis until there was a great necessity to use it.{{Cite dragon/377/Explore Airspur|64-65}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Four Stewards|Steward of the Sky]] [[Lehaya]] was in charge of the research on the Virushead, and she tasked a group of [[wizard]]s to learn how to focus the diseases created by it to target specific creatures while leaving genasi unscathed. However, the Steward of Fire, [[Magnol]], opposed her, believing the Virushead was too dangerous to be released. Mostly due to Magnol's protests, Queen [[Arathane]] outlawed any experimentation on the Virushead, forcing Lehaya to resort to study it clandestinely.
