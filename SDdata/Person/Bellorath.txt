Bellorath was a minotaur cult leader who dwelt within the Heartcoil Deeps of the Northdark as of the late 15 century DR. He had previously been human.
Bellorath was known for his rage and anguish. He personally attacked any travelers who entered his territory, and was not too proud to retreat in order to draw combatants into a trap.
Bellorath led a cult of minotaurs, and ruled over a small but labyrinthine domain in the Heartcoil Deeps. In order to sustain and grow his following, the cult preyed on travelers and explorers in the surrounding Underdark.
As a human, Bellorath once led a failed uprising against Chaunteas Citadel, after which he and his followers fled into the Heartcoil Deeps and were never heard from again. This did not mean he was idle or dead, however, as he spent his exile seeking out fiendish power in order to punish his enemies. The Deeps were known for access to such powers, and soon his efforts transformed him and his cultists into minotaurs.While not stated in Warriors of Waterdeep, given that Bellorath contacted a fiendish power that turned him into a minotaur, it may be assumed that his patron was Baphomet. This allowed them to carve out a domain within the Deeps, and over the years, they grew their cult by attacking travelers and striking out at their enemies one by one. Their expansion disrupted the hunting grounds of many dangerous creatures, notably umber hulks.
In the meantime, Bellorath had became something of a legend among some folk from Harvestshield Mountain. Eventually, two minor nobles&mdashElcharn and Cielaro&mdashwent into the notoriously dangerous Heartcoil Deeps to learn what had happened to him. Upon encountering them, Bellorath attacked and separated Elcharn and Cielaro, leading to their tragic demises elsewhere in the Heartcoil Deeps.
In the late 15 century DR, Bellorath and his cult clashed with a neighboring clan of stone giants who were fleeing their home following an incursion by mind flayers led by Qholillaroon. Not long after, a group of adventurers from Waterdeep arrived to investigate what the giants were fleeing from. Bellorath rushed out to attack them, but was driven off in the fighting.
