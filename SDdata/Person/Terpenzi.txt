'''Terpenzi''' was a [[ha-naga]] and the first ruler of [[Najara]], taking this position in {{Yearlink|-361}}. Terpenzi ruled from the capitol city of [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]] until his death in [[90 DR]].

==History==
In [[89 DR]], Terpenzi foresaw its own death and ordered its servants to search for [[Netheril|Netherese]] artifacts. In the meantime, it searched for a mate. In the next year, it was indeed killed in battle with [[Verraketh]] the Shadowking.

After being killed by the Shadowking, it returned more powerful than before in [[undead|undeath]], Terpenzi continued to serve the kings who ruled after it, fighting the relic but still caring about Najara. It resided in the [[Snake Pit]] of [[Ss'khanaja]] among the treasures of the kingdom.
