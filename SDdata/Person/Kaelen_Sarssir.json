        "mainbody": "'''Kaelen Sarssir''' was an actor and the proprietor of the [[Talking Troll]] tavern in [[Triboar]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Kaelen was a struggling actor who happened to \"inherit\" the Talking Troll tavern, but he put the least amount of effort and care into its maintenance and upkeep. Instead, his dream was to transform the building into a theater, if somehow he could find the money and the ambition to start the project. He spoke of his plans with new patrons, in the hopes of enticing one to donate or become a sponsor or even a partner, but only if it put him in little to no risk."
