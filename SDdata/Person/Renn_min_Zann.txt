Imam Renn min Zann was the highest representative of the assembled Enlightened faiths throughout all of Zakhara. His official title was "Keeper of the Mosques," and he worked in golden Huzuz, the City of Delights.
Renn min Zann was described as a silver-haired fixture of court life, owing to the longevity of his race. Despite being short of stature, his presence demanded respect.
The imam was a very pragmatic man and gained a healthy reputation for his wisdom and ability to mediate between the moralists, pragmatists, and ethoists.He spent equal time at the Golden Mosque, the Court of Enlightenment, and the Mosque of Zann the Wise in Huzuz.
Renn possessed an aba of protection +4, ring of spell turning, ring of truth, rod of resurrection, gem of seeing, and a staff of devotion.
Renn was the son of a barbarian elf from the distant north and the elven daughter of a well-known Zakharan merchant. A longtime presence in the political circles of Huzuz, the imam served the current Grand Caliph, Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir, as well as his father and grandfather.
