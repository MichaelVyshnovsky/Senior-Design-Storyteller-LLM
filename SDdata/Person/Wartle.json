        "mainbody": "artle was a self-centered slaad lord that could physically drain his enemies and was mentally draining to deal with.\nWartle appeared as a bloated,  slaad with dry, leathery, grayish-brown skin with sickly green spots. A row of small, backward pointing horns on the top of his head gave the appearance of a crest. When taking on human form, he typically appeared as short and pudgy with a whiny, raspy-sounding voice. In either form, however, he was covered in warts.\nWartle came off as weak, cowardly, and incompetent, but in truth he was highly intelligent, a frequent and proficient liar, and a more than capable combatant. While not exactly evil, Wartles unrepentantly chaotic ways could boggle the minds of most. Normally he didnt take slaves, if only because it was often more trouble than it was worth, but he might pretend not to know acquaintances while selling them to other slaadi. On the other hand, especially if they might be useful to him, he might treat those same acquaintances with some kindness.  More than anything he was crude, and that was in addition to him being whimsical, flippant, and inconsistent.\nWhile not as powerful as beings like Ssendam and Ygorl, Wartle was dangerous in his own right. He could utilize his claws and fangs in combat, and his powerful bite was not only physically damaging, but it also drained the vitality of his victims. He could shapechange between his human and slaad forms, as well as the form of a normal toad whenever he wished. Wartle also naturally regenerated from injury and couldnt be harmed by fire.\nWartle could cast the spell-like abilities advanced illusion, darkness, 15 radius, flaming sphere, fireball, teleport without error, and true seeing at will. He could also try to summon 1-3 green slaadi every minute, though this power only worked a little over half of the time. Once per day, he could cast any symbol spell, power word stun, transmute rock to mud, and wall of stone or iron\nWartles favored weapon was an enchanted, dancing morning star. Typically he began battle in his human form before letting his weapon fight on its own and then transforming into his slaad form.\nWartle was typically looked down on in Limbo, though a few lesser slaadi took a liking to him. He had met the violent wrath of the other slaad lords more than once for his frequent insults and rudeness, though he was would happily trade them slaves for favors.\nWhile still a slaad lord living in Limbo, Wartle came into conflict with Ygorl, another slaad lord. Wartle lost the struggle and was transformed into a meteor by Ygorl who proceeded to hurl the rock at Mount Celestia, where it landed in the ocean of Lunia. Being an artifact of extreme chaos, the rock was repulsed by the holy water and washed up on an island. The island housed a citadel commanded by an astral deva that ordered the rock brought into his fortress for further study. Unfortunately, while the deva was away on urgent business in Solania, the chaotic radiation from the transformed Wartle drove the other celestials completely insane.\nIt was unknown what the celestials did with the meteor after containing it. It was possible that Wartle, encased in the meteorite, was brought to Chronias to be completely destroyed. On the other hand, the lords of Celestia might have decided to send him back to Limbo so he could continue annoying the other slaad lords, teaching them that the Mount was not to be used as their personal dumping ground."
