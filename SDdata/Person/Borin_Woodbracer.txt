'''Borin Woodbracer''' was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[Adventurer|ex-adventurer]] who worked for Lord [[Partic Thistle]] as a handyman at [[Thistleflame Keep]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Personality==
Borin was a gruff and quiet fellow, but also creative and thoughtful. He adored the exterior stonework of Thistleflame, a major influence on his desire to work at the estate.

He had an unfortunate habit of drinking too much at the [[Bubbling Bulwark]] and rampaging around the common room, breaking furniture and causing a mess. This would result in Lord Thistle paying for the damages, or Borin performing the repairs himself.

==Possessions==
He had a magical [[warhammer]] from his time as an adventurer.

==Relationships==
Borin was a good friend to Thistleflame's gardener, [[Berke Glorata]], as he didn't feel threatened by his stunning good looks. He tended to get on less well with [[Elf|elves]] and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] such as [[Kaleb Fleetwing]], who he had a general distrust of.
