Wilund was an adventurer who searched for the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre some time before the midâ€“14 century DR.
Wilund came into possession of an antique spellbook called The Alcaister and gave it to the sage Ardagundus of Baldurs Gate in exchange for information on the Chessmens functions and whereabouts. It is unknown if Wilund succeeded or not in his search.
