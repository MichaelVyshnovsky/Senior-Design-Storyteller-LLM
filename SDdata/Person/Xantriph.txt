'''Xantriph''', known as '''The Voice of Bane''', was a [[beholder]] member of the [[Zhentarim]] and one of the closest allies of [[Manshoon]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/83/The Everwinking Eye: Something Is Rotten At The Citadel Of The Raven|31}}

==History==
Xantriph was a beholder living in the [[Temple in the Sky]], a strange flying hollow rock over [[Teshendale]]. Informed by his spies of the strange place, Manshoon investigated personally, hoping to find powerful magic. Instead, he discovered the beholder Xantriph. The two canny individuals joined forces, claiming the rock was a conduit to the gods. [[Banite]] priests flocked to the place where Xantriph, calling itself the Voice of Bane, instructed them all to do as Manshoon commanded, joining the Zhentarim and leading them away from the decadent High Imperceptor of the church. However, in order to do this, Manshoon and his magelings had to pledge fealty to [[Bane]], promising to lead the faith to even greater heights of power than the weakening High Imperceptor had. Furthermore, Manshoon promised control of the priesthood and [[Zhentil Keep]] to the beholders, or so it seemed. Xantriph's pact promised support to the Zhentarim in exchange for an army of warriors, wizards, and priests in an assault on [[Ooltul]].

Xantriph sent certain small sneaking creatures to spy on Zhentish citizens and Banite priests, and passed information to Manshoon, who would use it to eliminate any threats to him.<ref>

The plot was ruined when, in the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, the adventurers known as the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] discovered the Temple and in exploring it they found Xantriph. The Knights soon fought the evil monster and killed Xantriph.

In the years after, Xantriph and Zorkha were largely supplanted by [[Manxam]] as the most powerful beholder in human affairs in the region and allies of Manshoon and [[Fzoul Chembryl]], though Manxam kept a lower profile than Xantriph did.

==Relationships==
Xantriph was an ally of Manshoon and commanded [[Zorkha]]. The [[Xanathar (original)|original Xanathar]] was a follower of Xantriph sent to sabotage [[Waterdeep]] and overthrow the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].<ref>
