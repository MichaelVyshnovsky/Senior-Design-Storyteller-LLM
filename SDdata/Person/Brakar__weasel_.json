        "Description": "Brakar had fur that matched the color of his master's eyes almost perfectly.",
        "History": "Chaid first bonded with Brakar on [[28 Uktar|Uktar 28]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, after a night and morning of performing the required magical ritual. Chaid wanted to name the creature \"Brakar\", after the [[brakar]], a two-[[gold]] piece in circulation in [[Darromar]], the capital of [[Tethyr]]. On the advice of [[Tsarra Chaadren]], Chaid first asked the weasel if he already had a name, and, on learning that he did not, asked if he minded being called \"Brakar\", to which the little magic animal agreed. Brakar was very happy to be given a name and took it as a gift.\n\nLater in the day, Brakar skittered across Chaid's shoulders and heads in excitement at seeing inside the gates of [[Waterdeep]] for the first time.\n\nTsarra had to instruct her own familiar, the [[tressym]] [[Nameless (tressym)|Nameless]] that the weasel was not food."
