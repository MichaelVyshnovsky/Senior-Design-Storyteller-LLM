'''Abalajar Ocerat''' was a [[human]] [[mage-killer]] from [[Thay]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who wandered [[Faerûn]] to seek out and kill all [[wizard]]s he came across.

==Personality==
Abalajar had an abiding hatred for wizards and saw them all as evil. He found that he could not live in a world where they had infiltrated all aspects of life and society, and so he set out to do something about it. Although he knew he could not feasibly kill ''all'' wizards, he felt that each killing helped make Faerûn a slightly better place.

He was deeply traumatized by his parents' murder at the hands of the [[Red Wizards]]; when under great stress he suffered delusions where he relived the moments leading up to their deaths.

Although he felt they were worthy of respect, Abalajar chose not to follow any particular [[deity]].

==Abilities==
Abalajar's fighting style was influenced by his opponent of choice. He preferred weakening his enemies with [[spell]]s before closing on them with physical attacks. He favored ray-type and touch-type spells such as ''[[ray of exhaustion]]'' and ''[[touch of idiocy]]'' for this purpose.

Despite his intolerance for wizards, Abalajar was actually an accomplished [[diviner]] in his own right, capable of casting many advanced spells like ''[[Rary's mnemonic enhancer]]'', ''[[kiss of the vampire]]'', and ''[[Simbul's spell matrix]]''.

Abalajar possessed a rare innate talent allowing him to cast [[arcane magic|arcane]] spells as [[divine magic]]. This made it very difficult for his wizardly opponents to determine what spell he was casting.

==Possessions==
He carried multiple weapons, including a masterwork [[longsword]], [[short sword]], and [[composite longbow]]. He wore a [[magic]]al ''[[chain shirt]]'' in combat, as well as a ''[[vest of resistance]]'', a ''[[ring of counterspells]]'', and three ''[[pearl of power|pearls of power]]''.
==Activities==
He carefully planned each of his wizard kills in advance, sometimes spending weeks observing his victim. He preferred catching his prey when they were alone and isolated, but occasionally found himself forced to fight bodyguards and the like. Abalajar did his best to ensure the permanent death of his victims, making sure only prohibitively expensive [[magic]] could bring them back to life.

==Relationships==
He spent the majority of his time alone, but would occasionally travel with groups provided they did not include any users of arcane magic.

==History==
Abalajar was born into a family of farmers in the Thayan tharch of [[Priador]]. He displayed no signs of magical ability as a child, and so was left to grow up with his family. During his formative years, he witnessed first-hand how the Red Wizards brutally mistreated the people of Thay. When his own parents were killed by Red Wizards over a slight breach in etiquette, Abalajar had had enough, and fled the farm as his family burned. He returned shortly after to bury his parents and to retrieve his parents, then journeyed north to begin training as a ranger.

His years as a ranger were largely motivated by his desire to kill wizards to avenge his parents. During this time, Abalajar was greatly influenced by an encounter with the [[halfling]] [[Perinsa Falmarya]], whose family had also been killed by wizards. She taught Abalajar that he could fight back against his enemies and make something of his life. Although he tried to suppress it, Abalajar also felt a growing innate talent for [[magic]] during these years. He eventually met a man who suggested Abalajar embrace magic and use it to strike back at his hated wizards. Abalajar took this to heart, spending several years studying magic and practicing fighting "lesser" spellcasters, culminating in his first kill of an actual wizard.

Following the slaying of his first wizard, Abalajar followed the path of the mage-killer, wandering Faerûn and marking arcane adherents for death. He was known to have slain over forty wizards all in all, with most of them failing to return to life. He hoped to one day train several apprentices to carry on his work.
