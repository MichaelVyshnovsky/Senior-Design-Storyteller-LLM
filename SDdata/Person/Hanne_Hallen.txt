Hanne Hallen was a young drow wizard of Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR.
Hanne was very close to her mother, Zhora Hallen. She and her family were allies of House Mizzrym.
Hanne was a wizard-in-training in Menzoberranzan. She lived with her mother and the other Dark Hunters, a group of drow explorers that hunted for purple worm eggs in order to sell to wizards in the city.
Circa 1486 DR, Hanne went on an egg run with the Dark Hunters in the Wormwrithings, but the passage of a purple worm divided her from the group.
