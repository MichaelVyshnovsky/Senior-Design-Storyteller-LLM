        "mainbody": "iles Breakbone was a knight in the Order of the Gauntlet as well as the commander of Camp Vengeance in Chult during the late 15 century DR.\nNiles was a devout servant of Tyr He was a dedicated member of the Order of the Gauntlet and was seen as representing its best qualities, although the stain of the jungle campaign had led him to become desperate and unreasonable. He viewed Camp Vengeance as existing in a permanent state of emergency, and anyone who refused his orders&mdashregardless of their relationship to the Order of the Gauntlet&mdashwas deemed a traitor to be punished or executed.\nNiles commanded a force of over fifty soldiers, templars, and scouts, although their combat readiness was often hobbled by disease. He directed them to combat and purge the surrounding jungle of undead to little success. He tried to ensure that his forces had enough canoes or rowboats on hand to ferry them all to safety in case of an evacuation of Camp Vengeance, but was severely short-staffed in terms of both boats and hands to row them. Likewise, he was eager to conscriot any passing adventurers who had demonstrated the skills to survive in the treacherous jungles.\nCommander Breakbone was largely unable or uninterested in managing his Camp as he found the needs of his jungle campaign to be well outside of his expertise and comfort. He was prone to spend his days studying outdated maps of Chult and reviewing reports about supplies\nHe oversaw a number of key lieutenants, many of whom demonstrated greater competence than he and thus would sometimes push back against his more unreasonable orders. These included Captains Ord Firebeard and Perne Salhana (leading the troops), Sister Cyas (leading the Camps acolytes), and Lorsa Bilwatal (who headed a group of Chultan scouts and guides). His expedition was also joined by one of his personal friends, the scout Wulf Rygor.\nNiles grew suspicious of the old witch Nanny Pupu at Mbala.\nHis struggles at Camp Vengeance&mdashif not his failures&mdashwere known to Alastar Bol, the Order of the Gauntlets agent in Port Nyanzaru, and the merchant prince Wakanga Otamu.\nCommander Breakbone worked hard to avoid repeating the disaster of Camp Righteous, However, he proved to be woefully inept at adapting to the jungle conditions.\nDuring the events of the death curse, he came to suspect that Nanny Pupu knew something about the curse. His suspicions made their way to Wakanga Otamu, who came to believe that Niles might know something about the curses origins."
