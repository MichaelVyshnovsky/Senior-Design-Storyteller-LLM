'''Alaghlar of the Horns''' was one of the archwizards of the [[Speculum]], the Hall of Wizards of [[Myth Drannor]] long before the advent of the [[Weeping War]].

==History==
Alaghlar of the Horns was responsible for the creation of a ''[[safehold]]'', an extradimensional room, tied to the Hall of Wizards. Hidden from creatures pillaging the ruins of the [[Speculum Grounds]], the ''safehold'' was stocked with food, ''[[spellbook]]s'', and emergency supplies. The hidden extradimensional room was rumored to be guarded powerful wards and guardians, one such guardian being a [[deepspawn]]. The only way of accessing the ''safehold'' was via inserting the correct key into a hole at the center of Speculum's floor.
