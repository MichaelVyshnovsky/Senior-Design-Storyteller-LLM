'''Dwindling Greene''' was the daughter of [[Dholber Greene]] and one of the guests of [[Nortale's Hostel]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''I'm so scratchy. Stupid lice.''|Dwindling Greene}}

==Description==
Like her father, Dwindling was a [[human]] with dark skin. She also shared his brown eyes and had straight brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Absolute crisis]] ravaged the [[Western Heartlands]], the city of Baldur's Gate became flooded with refugees. Dholber Greene was lucky enough to secure lodgings for himself and Dwindling at Nortale's Hostel that offered beds to the refugees. Dwindling and her father lost family members, who did not make it to the Gate. At the hostel, the girl complained about [[lice]] and funny-smelling [[soap]].
