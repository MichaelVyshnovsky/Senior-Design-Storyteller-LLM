==Description==
Merony was a [[gołd dwarven]] woman with an olive skin tone and a dark chestnut eyes. She kept her face clean-shaven and wore a cowl atop of her [[armor]]. Merony was armed with a [[light crossbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Merony was one of three enthralled sentries who stood guard of the entrance to the massive Szarr Palace – home of [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]] located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. On the day of the accession ritual, the palace's chamberlain [[Antwun Dufay‎]] ordered no visitor nor delivery to be allowed an entrance, promising a "reward" from Cazador upon the ritual's completion.
