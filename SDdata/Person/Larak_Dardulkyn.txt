'''Larak Dardulkyn''' was an independent [[wizard]] in [[Suzail]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. His power was widely reputed to be great and terrible.

==Personality==
He was self-interested, and quite overbold about it.

==Appearance==
The man was tall and rather homely, often dressing in black robes with a high collar.

==Relationships==
Though an independant mage, he came under the mental control of the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|205-208|22}}

==Abilities==
His house had a cloud of spinning weapons in the lobby, most likely something he'd made. Amongst other powers, he claimed to have the ability to make himself look like Storm Silverhand, and that this was a least power; he claimed he crafted [[helmed horror]]s, and even [[direhelm]]s; he could cast at least one spell inducing paralyzation, likely ''[[hold person]]'', a spell that attacked several targets with lightning, and another that dashed many targets into the ground at once. Another of his spells created many spheres of burning flame at once, in a manner strongly resembling ''[[meteor swarm]]''.

Per Manshoon, Dardulkyn's wards were pitiful.

While puppeteered by Manshoon, Dardulkyn employed a different suite, with a powerful bolt that launched its target in spite of many wards, even through warded walls, and a powerful lightning spell that struck near-dead a very powerfully warded target.

==Possessions==
His home had once been the residence of [[Raskival Rhendever]], and before that, of Lord [[Sarlival (Lord)|Sarlival]]. In the large manor, he had four [[direhelm]]s, and a large number of [[helmed horror]]s.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|175-181|19}} In his cellar, he kept one [[griffon]] in a cage, for purposes unknown. The man also owned a number of tomes and nondescript ''[[enchanted]]'' items.

==Reputation==
He was an expensive man to hire, and a mighty wizard, believed to be cold and impolite.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|366|35}}

==History==
The night after the catastrophic [[Council of the Dragon]] in {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the young noble [[Arclath Delcastle]] went to Larak's mansion and attempted to hire him to protect his beloved [[coinlass]], [[Amarune Whitewave]], from the fugitive mage, [[Elminster Aumar]]. He managed to get an audience despite it being quite late only by mentioning his name and family.

Dardulkyn quickly dismissed Arclath's concerns, and then tried to take him prisoner. Arclath did not take this sitting down, and in fact, stood up, quickly finding a hidden window to jump out of the mansion. Dardulkyn paralyzed him with a spell when he had almost crossed the street; it was just his luck that he was spotted by Amarune and the Marchioness [[Immerdusk]], [[Storm Silverhand]], who were in the company of [[Mirt]] and Elminster, currently ashes but still conscious.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|175-181|19}} Elminster sprang into action, and taking over the body of Amarune, spell-battled Dardulkyn, destroyed many of his helmed horrors, and much of his house.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|185-188|20}} While the man still reeled from this, the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] suspected he was Elminster, and decided to determine whether he was;{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|200|21}} after being satisfied he was not, decided to take the opportunity to enslave his mind. His first act was to coldly dismiss the [[Purple Dragon]] [[Rorlyn Handmane]], who had been sent to determine if any aid was necessary.

Dardulkyn was left in a closet of his own home while Manshoon moved a number of [[beholder]]s into his home.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|217-219|23}} He was forced to blow them up from a safe distance away, however, as the Purple Dragons came too close to discover them in transit.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|223-224|24}} He considered adapting his plans to work through Dardulkyn.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|263|28}}

He later used Dardulkyn to attack [[Cymmarra]], an ancient apprentice of his' that had gone on to control [[blueflame ghost]]s, as she went into [[Castle Obarskyr]] following Storm Silverhand, who wielded a ''blueflame'' buckle.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|327|34}} Dardulkyn pursued through the ''[[Dalestride Portal]]'', into [[Shadowdale]], where [[the Simbul]]'s hideout was; once there, he struck a number of damaging spells on Cymmarra, but was ultimately incapacitated by a poisoned sword. He barely managed to get away, and it was unclear whether he survived or not.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|331-332|35}}

Regardless of whether he survived, Manshoon continued to squat at his home afterwards.{{cite book/Elminster Enraged||2}}{{cite book/Elminster Enraged||4}}{{cite book/Elminster Enraged||21}}
