'''Deathsleep''' was a [[green dragon]] who made his home in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Deathsleep was mostly green with yellow eyes. He had golden-yellow scales on his belly. Deathsleep's wings were a mix of green and yellow.

==Personality==
Deathsleep was [[evil|malicious]] and very aggressive against strangers frequenting the road near his lair.

==Activities==
He survived by robbing and killing travelers and traders who passed along a road not far from his lair.

He was focused on destroying Neverwinter Wood and killing random passersby in order to gain sustenance and treasure.

==History==
After a streak of killings, robberies, and forest destruction, Deathsleep was probably killed by a party of [[adventurer]]s consisting of an [[elf]], [[human]], [[dragonborn]] and [[dwarf]] who ventured into the Neverwinter Wood to stop his activities.
