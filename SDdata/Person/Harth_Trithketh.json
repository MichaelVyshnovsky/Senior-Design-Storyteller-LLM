        "mainbody": "Harth Trithketh was the owner of Harth Trithkeths House of Welcome, a luxurious inn located in Khôltar, south Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nHarth had shiny black eyes, and an unusually sharp (for a gnome), pointed nose. When he laughed or grinned, he looked truly wicked.\nHe was inquisitive as well as acquisitive, frequently lurking about the inn and spying on his guests. He had a merry outlook on life and relaxed in the company of the escorts he employed to service his guests, usually four or five at a time."
