Lamris Kholl was a cleric of Tymora from Llorkh in the Savage Frontier living in Waterdeep in the early 1370s DR.
Lamris had a vivacious and unpredictable personality. She was capricious and irresponsible but remained a true worshiper of Tymora. For years, she toyed with fellow priest Adama Miiralins emotions but after he volunteered his help, she began to develop feelings for him.
Lamris hailed from Llorkh but escaped the Zhent tyranny there. After settling in Waterdeep, she started making plans to rescue her entire family from the city. Circa 1372 DR, with the help of Adama, Lamris finally managed to free her family.
