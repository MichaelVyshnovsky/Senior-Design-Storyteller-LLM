'''Tlyysixxous''' was a [[sahuagin]] [[priestess]], who lived in the [[City of Caverns]].

==Description==
The priestess, like many of her kind, did not like other types of [[humanoid]]s, thinking them nothing more than spurious beasts.

==Combat==
The priestess did not use melee weapons, and instead had a selection of [[spells]], the most powerful of which were ''[[blade barrier]]'' and ''[[slay living]]''.

==History==
Around [[1369 DR]], she try to persuade King [[Ixilthetocal]] to kill [[Gorion's Ward]] and his party. After a heated argument with [[Senityili]], the king ordered her to be killed via holy sacrifice.
