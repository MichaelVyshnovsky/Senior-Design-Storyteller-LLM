'''Dagmar''' was an inhabitant of [[Ruathym]] in [[1361 DR]].

==History==
Dagmar was born with her twin sister [[Ygraine]] to the shaman [[Ulf]] and his wife. An omen said that Ygraine would bring back the ancient magic of the [[Shapechange]] and thus it was decided she must marry [[Wedigar]], the only man gifted with that power.

As they grew up together, Dagmar had become envious of her sister and so decided to eliminate her. In [[1360 DR]], she allied with the [[Kraken Society]] and they kidnapped Ygraine, who was kept prisoner in [[Ascarle]].

After the disappearance of Ygraine, it was decided that Dagmar instead would marry Wedigar, becoming his second wife. In [[1361 DR]], Dagmar went to [[Holgerstead]] to marry Wedigar but Ulf sent with her the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Liriel Baenre]], who was at that time his apprentice.

Lieriel managed to unveil the betrayal of Dagmar, who had sold her people out to the Krakenar.
