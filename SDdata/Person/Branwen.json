Although she was from an island chain to the southwest, she spent some significant time adventuring the Sword Coast.\nBranwen possessed the unique ability to summon a spiritual hammer.  \nBorn in the village of Seawolf in the Norheim Isles, Branwen was reviled by her fellow villagers for pursuing the traditionally male-oriented profession of priest. She wandered the Sword Coast, eventually falling in with a malicious adventuring troupe. \nSome time during or around the , Branwen realized the troupe engaged in banditry. She rebelled against them but was turned to stone by the mage Tranzig and left at the Nashkel carnival. \nBranwen was buried in the Lower City Graveyard of Baldurs Gate, next to the Durinbold Mausoleum.

The Foehammer grants you honor in death.\" Her grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and body risen as an undead by Nina Dortmell, a talented child with the Gift, who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
