        "mainbody": "'''Branwen''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]] who lived in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Although she was from an [[Moonshae Isles|island chain]] to the southwest, she spent some significant time adventuring the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Powers": "Branwen possessed the unique ability to summon a ''[[spiritual hammer]]''.",
        "History": "Born in the village of [[Seawolf (village)|Seawolf]] in the [[Norheim Isles]], Branwen was reviled by her fellow villagers for pursuing the traditionally male-oriented profession of [[priest]]. She wandered the Sword Coast, eventually falling in with a malicious adventuring troupe. \n\nSome time during or around the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Branwen realized the troupe engaged in banditry. She rebelled against them but was turned to stone by the [[mage]] [[Tranzig]] and left at the [[Nashkel carnival]]. \n\nBranwen was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]] of Baldur's Gate, next to the [[Durinbold Mausoleum]]. Her gravestone was etched with a single inscription: \"*Mighty Branwen. The Foehammer grants you honor in death.\" Her grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and body risen as an [[undead]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with the [[Gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
