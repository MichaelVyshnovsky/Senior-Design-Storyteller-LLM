Galaer Grasswave was an elf wizard of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR and the Green Regent, a Chosen of Mielikki, over 1368 and 1369 DR.
Galaer was considered kind and gentle hearted, and was of a studious nature.
A member of the Bentillail elven family, Galaer was a philosopher at the VeltiEnorethal school in Loudwater. He was also an expert on elven high magic wards and mythals his peers saw him as a prodigy.
As Green Regent, Galaer focused his efforts on repairing and improving the magical wards that protected Loudwater from disease and invasion and nourished its gardens. Magically adept Scions of the Green Regent aided Galaer in the task, while the others gathered special components and knowledge for them.
On Shieldmeet of the , Galaer Grasswave was chosen to be the next Green Regent.
Galaer and the Scions were engaged in certain vital rituals on Standing Stone Hill to repair the citys magical wards when, on the Night of the Blood Moon in the , Malarite lycanthropes attacked Loudwater. Galaer could not halt nor pause the rituals for wards that might yet protect Loudwater, and so was forced to divide both his attention and his forces, keeping half the available Scions to defend the hill and sending the other half to defend the folk of Loudwater. More than three-quarters of the Scions fell to the lycanthropes in two nights of fighting, but they prevented interruption of the ritual and saved many folk from Malarite depredations.
But on the third night, the Malarites came again and this time, they targeted Standing Stone Hill and the Green Regents ritual. When they overran the citys defenses, they killed Galaer Grasswave and mounted his head on a stake outside the northeastern earthen ramparts of the city. Nevertheless, Glaers ritual was mostly completed, though exactly which parts was unknown the scholars, wizards, and clerics of the VeltiEnorethel were still trying to ascertain this three years later.
