        "mainbody": "'''Traevyn Illance''' was an old noble in [[Cormyr]] and lord of the [[Illance]] noble house in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "He was ruthless, and perhaps a little dramatic.",
        "Appearance": "Traevyn Illance was white-haired.",
        "Possessions": "He wore a half-cloak, worn boots, and carried a black walking cane. One of his rings was almost certainly ''[[enchanted]]'' in a way that would bring death upon a half-dozen people if needed, through means left unsaid.",
        "Relationships": "Lord Traevyn had been a friend and creditor of [[Broryn Windstag]]'s father; he was the one person Lord Windstag had trusted from youth. His son was [[Rothglar Illance]].",
        "Activities": "Lord Traevyn Illance was part of a faction that sought to mind-control the king and dismantle the [[War Wizards]].",
        "History": "Around {{yearlink|1450}}, Traevyn Illance loaned 700,000 [[golden lion (coin)|golden lions]] to [[Rauligus Helderstone]], with an interest rate such that 10,000 more would be owed on the year, every year.\n\nAfter the disastrous [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}} Traevyn visited [[Staghaven House]], looking to invite the young nobles meeting therein (Broryn Windstag, [[Mellast Ormblade]], [[Sacrast Handragon]]) into his faction. While he was there, [[Marlin Stormserpent]] arrived, asking to be sheltered from an unknown assailant who invaded his mind and controlled [[beholder]]s. Before that could be resolved, [[Osbur]], a servant of the [[Oldbridle]] family, also turned up, delivering a warning upon Traevyn, which he allowed the others to hear.\n\nThat night, he sent the mages Morligul Downdagger and [[Scarmar Heldeth]] to capture Rauligus Helderstone, actually [[Mirt]] in disguise; only Morligul returned to him, with Scarmar cutting loose and fleeing after the strike. Morligul reported at [[the Three Ravens]], after which they headed for the warehouse where he'd stashed \"Rauligus\"; unknown to Traevyn, Morligul himself had been replaced by the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]]. Traevyn then explained to the false Rauligus that he was going to make him sign off all properties by force as a manner of repaying his debts, and then ship him off naked to [[Westgate]]. Then, he got knocked out by [[Storm Silverhand]], who was also impersonating Rauligus' current playpretty, the lady [[Darlethra Greatgaunt]]; Elminster stole all his stuff, with an eye to take all his magical items.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Elminster and Storm resolved to spread the rumor that Traevyn Illance had captured and tortured Rauligus Helderstone to death as a way to slow him down."
