The cult chapter's leader, [[Therus]], sent Drayson back to the city to spread their doctrine among the worshipers of [[Umberlee]]. However, the high priestess of Umberlee, [[Rydah]] the Storm Soother, saw the threat and some of her followers killed Drayson.{{Cite adventurers league/The Drowned Tower|5}}"
