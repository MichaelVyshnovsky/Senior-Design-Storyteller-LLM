His partner was Salvar Brix.\nIn 1491 DR, during a routine visit to a lost tower near the city, Drayson was captured by the Cult of the Crushing Wave and brainwashed into joining them. The cult chapters leader, Therus, sent Drayson back to the city to spread their doctrine among the worshipers of Umberlee. However, the high priestess of Umberlee, Rydah the Storm Soother, saw the threat and some of her followers killed Drayson."
