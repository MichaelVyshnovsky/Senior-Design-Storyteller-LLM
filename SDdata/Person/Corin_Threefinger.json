        "mainbody": "Corin Threefinger was a half-elf Tymoran cleric and second mate of the Osprey, an independent shipping vessel in the Dragon Reach that he had been sailing with for almost five years.\nCorin was a rather handsome individual, sporting long blond hair and sparking green eyes.\nThough he considered serving the goddess Tymora to be his primary duty in life, he was careful not to preach of her to his fellow crewmen who had already adopted their own religions. He also had a rather carefree nature.\nIn terms of divine magic, Corin usually carried around a number of curative and defensive spells. Such as cure light wounds, hold person, and silence. Beyond magic, Corin was rather proficient when it came to navigating, singing, and the use of blunt weaponry like the club, hammer, and mace. In terms of languages, he knew how to speak Common, Elvish, and Gnomish.\nIn terms of weaponry, Corin possessed a +1 longbow and a +1 long sword. When fights broke out on the deck he preferred to use the former, keeping his distance from the fray.\nNext to his duty towards Tymora, Corin considered his second most important duty in life to be serving his friend McAllister, the captain of the Osprey.\nDue to a combination of his carefree nature and dashing good looks, Corin was quite popular among the women of Ravens Bluff."
