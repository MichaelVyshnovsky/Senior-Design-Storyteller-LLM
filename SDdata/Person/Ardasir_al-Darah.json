        "mainbody": "heikh Ardasir al-Darah, also called the Incomparable, was a leader among the Jann of the Haunted Lands in the Burning Lands of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nArdasir stood  tall and appeared like a majestic Zakharan. He had dark hair and the distinctive pointed ears of his kind. His skin was tanned until it was almost black from long exposure to the harsh desert sun. He had piercing blue eyes that almost sparkled when he was excited. Ardasir wore dark robes typical of the al-Badia with the hopes of appearing as a large human or ogre at a distance.\nThe sheikh often displayed extreme arrogance about his own importance, perhaps because of a vision he received. He was well known for his generosty and hospitality, though he was prone to insult and the erratic behavior common to jann.\nArdasir experienced a powerful vision after drinking from the Well of Destiny in the Weeping Desert. The vision showed him as Amir of all jann of the Haunted Lands, ruling from an elegant throne adorned with peacocks. Spirits within the desert informed him this was the legendary Peacock Throne of Moradask. The throne was known to have been separated into 15 pieces, and Ardasir only believed he would become Amir after fully reassembling the throne. He had but a single piece as of 1367 DR.\nSheikh Ardasir carried a gold-hilted enchanted great scimitar named Final Arbiter, an enchanted longbow named Steel Rain, a gem of seeing, potions of dreaming, treasure finding, and clairaudience. He wore gilded lamellar armor and electrum bracers carved lions.\nThe shiekhs favorite concubine was a tasked artist genie named Safia. Ardasirs uncle was Amir Heidar Qan, the ruler of the jann of the Haunted Lands. Since Heidar disappeared decades ago, Ardasir began amassing favors among the other sheiks of the jann with the plan to assume outright rule over them."
