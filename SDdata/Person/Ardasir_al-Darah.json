        "mainbody": "Sheikh '''Ardasir al-Darah''', also called the '''Incomparable''', was a leader among the [[Jann of the Haunted Lands]] in the [[Burning Lands]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "Ardasir stood {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall and appeared like a majestic [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]]. He had dark hair and the distinctive pointed ears of his kind. His skin was tanned until it was almost black from long exposure to the harsh desert sun. He had piercing blue eyes that almost sparkled when he was excited. Ardasir wore dark robes typical of the [[al-Badia]] with the hopes of appearing as a large human or [[ogre]] at a distance.",
        "Personality": "The sheikh often displayed extreme arrogance about his own importance, perhaps because of a vision he received. He was well known for his generosty and hospitality, though he was prone to insult and the erratic behavior common to jann.",
        "History": "Ardasir experienced a powerful vision after drinking from the [[Well of Destiny]] in the [[Weeping Desert]]. The vision showed him as Amir of all jann of the [[Haunted Lands]], ruling from an elegant throne adorned with [[peacock]]s. Spirits within the desert informed him this was the legendary [[Peacock Throne]] of [[Moradask]]. The throne was known to have been separated into 15 pieces, and Ardasir only believed he would become Amir after fully reassembling the throne. He had but a single piece as of 1367 DR.",
        "Possessions": "Sheikh Ardasir carried a [[gold]]-hilted enchanted [[great scimitar]] named ''[[Final Arbiter]]'', an enchanted [[longbow]] named ''[[Steel Rain]]'', a ''[[gem of seeing]]'', potions of ''[[potion of dreaming|dreaming]]'', ''[[Potion of treasure finding|treasure finding]]'', and ''[[potion of clairaudience|clairaudience]]''. He wore gilded [[lamellar]] armor and [[electrum]] [[bracer]]s carved [[lion]]s.",
        "Relationships": "The shiekh's favorite concubine was a [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[artist genie]] named [[Safia]]. Ardasir's uncle was Amir [[Heidar Qan]], the ruler of the jann of the Haunted Lands. Since Heidar disappeared decades ago, Ardasir began amassing favors among the other sheiks of the jann with the plan to assume outright rule over them."
