Tee-a-nicknkick was a half-qullan pirate who plotted the assassination of Captain Deudermont with his companion, Creeps Sharky, in the late 1360s DR. 
The half-qullan man had thick black hair tied in a topknot, and tattoos covering practically every part of his body, including his face. He wore a tiger-skin kilt, which exposed a lot of his skin. He struggled with speaking Common, and would often replace words with others.
Tee-a-nicknick was born to a qullan tribe on an unknown island. Being only half-qullan, his ferocious tribe of full-blood qullans rejected him as inferior. Tee-a-nicknick remained on the island until he was taken by a group of pirates. After this, the half-qullan sailed with humans for most of his life.
He became friends with a fellow pirate known as Creeps Sharky, who realized Tee-a-nicknicks skill with the deadly blowgun. The exotic warrior concocted the blowgun dart with a cats claw, feathers, and an oozing syrup. Among the shadows of a rooftop, the pirates waited for Deudermont to exit the Cutlass inn in Luskan and meet with Wulfgar and Morik. After Tee-a-nicknick blew his dart into the pirate captain, they then moved down the street and pretended to be drunks to avoid the authorities.
Tee-a-nicknick was later caught, brutally tortured, and killed at Luskans Prisoners Carnival.
