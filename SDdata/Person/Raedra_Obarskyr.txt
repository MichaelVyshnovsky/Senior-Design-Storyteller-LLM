'''Raedra Obarskyr''' was the queen of [[Cormyr]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}. She was the daughter of King [[Irvel Obarskyr]] and the granddaughter of King [[Foril I]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|53}} She ascended the [[Dragon Throne]] following the kingdom's costly war with [[Sembia]] and [[Returned Netheril]].

==Description==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Raedra was considered a beautiful woman.

==Personality==
Her notable traits were described in comparison to other notable women of the [[Obarskyr]] family. Her intellect was likened to that of [[Tanalasta Obarskyr]] and she was said to have the strategy of [[Alusair Obarskyr|Alusair]], the charm of [[Filfaeril Obarskyr|Filfaeril]], and a temper akin to Cormyr's first Queen, [[Gantharla Obarskyr|Gantharla]].

==Abilities==
Though Raedra's swordsmanship was compared to that of the warrior queen [[Enchara]], this wasn't strictly true, as in her training she had a preference for rapiers as opposed to heavier blades.

==History==
Raedra Obarskyr was born in the {{YearlinkName|1460}}, the daughter of then Crown Prince [[Irvel Obarskyr|Irvel Obarskyr]] and his wife [[Ospra Goldfeather]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|62}} The princess was the couple's second child; she was younger sister to Prince [[Baerovus Obarskyr (prince)|Baerovus]]. Her birth marked the first time a daughter was born to [[Obarskyr|House Obarskyr]] in over a hundred years.

Before she had even reached the age of 20, Raedra was already a figure of great interest to the noble houses of the kingdom. By that time, she had already refused over a dozen marriage proposals, both domestic and foreign, most after only a moment's thought. She maintained that, being a princess whose bloodline was the culmination of the royal lines of [[Esparin]], [[Tethyr]], and ancient [[Athalantar]], she was not a prize to be won by any adventurer or noble. She vowed to only wed a husband worthy or her station, and perhaps her genuine love.

In the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, she married Earl [[Lindon Huntcrown]], but the marriage ended only two [[tenday]]s later when Raedra discovered his allegiance to [[Shar]] and ordered Lindon's public execution for treason.

In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, she served as regent for her wounded brother Baerovus and aided him after his recovery and coronation. During the siege of [[Suzail]], she killed a large [[wyvern]] disguised as [[Thauglorimorgorus]] and fought the army of [[Thultanthar]]. After the siege, she succeeded her father Irvel and her brother Baerovus as queen of Cormyr. Raedra was engaged to [[Aubrin Crownsilver]] but she dissolved their betrothal before she became queen.

She reigned as her kingdom recovered from the steep cost of the war with Sembia and Netheril. Though the pride of Cormyr's victory over its enemies was still prevalent in the realm's collective consciousness, Queen Raedra drew back from plans to expand its borders.
