==Activities==
Samia was the second of Imam [[Renn min Zann]], leading services in the mosque since his duties kept him at the [[Golden Mosque]] much of the time.

She was an expert linguist, being completely fluent in 27 languages. She was extremely interested in learning [[Drow language|Drow]] and [[Affa]], and was willing to pay for the chance to learn from a fluent speaker.
