She arranged to make a purchase of [[gem]]s from them at the [[Red Sheaf]] inn, while telling others a different story. Silke told [[Garrick]] and some others that Tessilan, Glayde, and Faltis were thugs coming to collect payment for a missed performance at [[Feldepost's Inn]]. She hoped to have Tessilan's group mugged in order to steal the gems and get away all the richer."
