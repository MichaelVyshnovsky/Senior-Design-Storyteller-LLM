'''Fallon''' was a [[Nentyar hunter]] in {{yearlink|1373}}.The event may also have happened in Mirtul 6, depending on whether midnight had fallen by the time the Rotting Man yielded in the fight against Araluen.

==Description==
While on garrison, Fallon wore dark green leather armor, and a silver leaf pin clasping a sea-green cloak.

==Personality==
Fallon was somewhat of a stickler for protocol who had a mild antipathy for Elowen,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|107-109|12}}<ref name=LoP-121>{{cite book/Lady of Poison|121|13}} often going out of his way to annoy her.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|131|14}} He was somewhat bothered by mention of the fall of Dun-Tharos. He also had an usually sour disposition, and a particular thirst for praise.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|124-125|13}} He also had a bit of a covetous, envious streak.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|128}} All of those seemed to stem from a certain egotism.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|201-202|20}}

Though Anammelech had been the one to cultivate a relationship with him, he eventually came to serve the Rotting Man without any protest- albeit out of fear rather than loyalty.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|169|17}}

However, he still had at his core a certain respect for life.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|174|17}}

==Abilities==
Fallon was still a hunter trained by the [[Circle of Leth]] whose survival skills were superlative.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|229-230|24}} He also knew of the way to employ the ''[[Keystone]]'' effectively, being able to use both created portals{{cite book/Lady of Poison|132-133|14}} and allowing other influences into the [[Celestial Nadir]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|138-140|14}}

==Possessions==
Of note, Fallon had been granted several special arrows by the [[Nentyarch]].

==Relationships==
[[Anammelech]] had been Fallon's handler for some time.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|202|20}} He went out of his way to annoy Elowen.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|131|14}}

==History==
Before {{yearlink|1373}}, Fallon was already Anammelech's ears in the Nentyarch's court, in exchange for gold.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|202|20}}

Fallon was amongst the [[Yeshelmaar]] garrison that greeted [[Elowen]] when she arrived there alongside [[Araluen]] in {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|107-109|12}} He attended the meeting with the [[Nentyarch]] the day after, where he was named one of the people that would accompany Araluen in her quest to confront the [[Rotting Man]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|120-121,124-125,128|13}}

He suggested to Elowen's group that they meet at Yeshelmaar's Skymeadow as a distraction while he collected the ''[[keystone]]'' and Araluen, then took them to the [[Arches of Xenosi]] while the party was away; they barely managed to catch up to the door he opened into the [[Celestial Nadir]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|131-133|14}} Fallon emerged on the Arches of Xenosi, where he rendered the ''keystone'' upon Anammelech, who set up an ambush and sent him on his way to the Rotting Man.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|155|15}} He was contacted directly by the Rotting Man, telepathically, on Anammelech's death, and given orders to proceed through an underground route, as well as a magical compulsion to obey the Talontyr's orders.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|168-174|17}}

While underground, in a moment of hesitation, the compulsion thereatened to destroy his mind; it was only Araluen's intervention that stopped it. Relieved, Fallon decided to switch sides again.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|204|20}} He placed an ambush for one of [[Damanda]]'s underlings in a hidden vault,{{cite book/Lady of Poison|229-231|24}} easily slaying [[Ezekial]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|234-235|24}} On reaching the surface, however, he was soon captured by Damanda; upon learning that Araluen's touch disintegrated vampires in a flash of light, she decided to keep him alive so that he could keep her moving. Nonetheless, he prepared a stake while they prepared to ambush the party coming after him.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|244-248|26}}

When the party finally caught up to the zone where the vampires were ready for the ambush, Fallon cleverly clued them as to the fact he wasn't alone.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|253-254|27}} He turned agains the vampires, however, just in time to prevent [[Lex]] from slaying Elowen; he staked her, but she retaliated just before disintegrating, slaying Fallon.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|258-259|27}}

After his death, Fallon was redeemed by Araluen.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|262|28}} She challenged the [[Rotting Man]] that same night, placing the day of his death as [[Mirtul 7]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|154}}
