'''Francan Fireblade''' was an elder councilor of the [[Dale Council]] in [[High Dale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Before his retirement in High Dale, Francan was an adventurer based out of the large city of [[Arabel]] in [[Cormyr]]. He lost his arm in battle during the [[Time of Troubles]] and shortly thereafter left the exciting world of traveling around [[Faer√ªn]] for a more quiet life of civil service.
