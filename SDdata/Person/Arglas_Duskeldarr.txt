Arglas Duskeldarr was a Highknight of Cormyr and King Azoun Obarskyrs IV cellarer, active circa 1348 DR.
Arglas Duskeldarr was attracted to his fellow Highknight Malustra Thaurant‎‎ and often had to drown his feelings in the Kings bottles and decanters.
Arglas Duskeldarrs main function was serving as the Kings cellarer, personally tasting every bottle, every drink, and every decanter that was to reach the rulers lips to ensure his safety. He often worked closely with Malustra Thaurant‎‎, under the direct orders of Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, the Royal Court Wizard of Cormyr. The duo were tasked with taking acre of adventurers favored by the King, who turned to treason and proved to be danger to the throne. Together they disposed of about half a dozen individuals, often via poison and subterfuge.
