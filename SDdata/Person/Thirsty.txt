Thirsty was Marlin Stormserpents pet stirge in the late 15 century DR.
Unlike other stirges, Thirsty liked to sample blood from many different people, instead of draining one target to death.
Marlin Stormserpent often painted Thirstys beak with a paralyzing poison. He had also trained the stirge well enough to know it was to go for a selected target first.
Thirsty was of course Marlins pet. Unknown to him, the evil archmage Manshoon sometimes took direct mental control of the stirge. It didnt like blueflame ghosts.
Marlin Stormserpent brought Thirsty to Castle Obarskyr in Suzail, hidden within his jerkin, when he came with a retinue to steal the Wyverntongue Chalice under cover of darkness. During the one skirmish they had with Purple Dragon knights on patrol, Thirsty was instrumental in paralyzing the one who split out from the group to summon reinforcements.
Marlin again hid Thirsty in his jerkin when meeting the city watch later, the day he was informed of Gaskurs murder, though he did not ultimately call on it.
Thirsty was later eliminated by Mirt after it tried to attack him as the man entered the Royal Palace of Suzail. Before the killing, Mirt had been last seen escaping out of Stormserpent Towers, where he had an altercation with Marlin and his co-conspirators after Marlin had realized he was not a blueflame ghost.
