Musayed was a shopkeeper in Baldurs Gate and an employee of Rilsa Rael, a crime lord of the Guild.
Musayed was a very quiet, but very observant individual. However, he was known to glare angrily or bob his head in agreement when he felt necessary.
Whilst Rael talked with visitors, who were often potential contacts of the Guild, Musayed served at her shops counter.
In 1482 DR, Musayed often ran the Calim Jewel Emporium for his employer, Rael. He attended meetings with Rael, which sometimes involved convincing others to join the Guild. Rilsa would not talk about her employee, though he would serve tea in her presence. Later that year, Musayed was sentenced to public execution by Ulder Ravengard. His fate remains unknown.
