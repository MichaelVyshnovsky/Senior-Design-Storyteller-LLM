'''Musayed''' was a shopkeeper in [[Baldur's Gate]] and an employee of [[Rilsa Rael]], a crime lord of [[the Guild]].

==Personality==
Musayed was a very quiet, but very observant individual. However, he was known to glare angrily or bob his head in agreement when he felt necessary.

==Activities==
Whilst Rael talked with visitors, who were often potential contacts of the Guild, Musayed served at her shop's counter.

==History==
In [[1482 DR]], Musayed often ran the [[Calim Jewel Emporium]] for his employer, Rael. He attended meetings with Rael, which sometimes involved convincing others to join the Guild. Rilsa would not talk about her employee, though he would serve [[tea]] in her presence. Later that year, Musayed was sentenced to public execution by [[Ulder Ravengard]]. His fate remains unknown.
