        "History": "Esmar was only a newborn baby in [[696 DR]] when his aunt [[Leluia Torlath|Leluia]]'s husband [[Arbas]] killed him and all the other male Torlaths in Amn, including Esmar's father Esmel IV.\n\nDuring the civil war in Amn following [[1276 DR]], various factions produced unlikely heirs descended from long-lost branches of the royal families. One such pretender was the so-called Prince [[Elashar Torlath]], descendant of Esmar, who appeared during the [[Great Amnian Trade War]] of [[1333 DR]] according to the manipulations of [[Harlo Ongalor]]."
