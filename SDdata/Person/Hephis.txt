'''Hephis''' was an enthusiastic tavern-goer who lived in [[Beregost]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Hephis was a regular patron of [[Feldepost's Inn]] and enjoyed singing lengthy tavern songs that went on seemingly forever. He became thoroughly annoyed whenever someone approached him while in the middle of a verse.
