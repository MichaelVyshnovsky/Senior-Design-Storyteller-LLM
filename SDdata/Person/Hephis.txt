Hephis was an enthusiastic tavern-goer who lived in Beregost during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Hephis was a regular patron of Feldeposts Inn and enjoyed singing lengthy tavern songs that went on seemingly forever. He became thoroughly annoyed whenever someone approached him while in the middle of a verse.
