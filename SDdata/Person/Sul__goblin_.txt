'''Sul''' was a warrior and [[cult of the Absolute|cultist]] of the [[Absolute]] who dwelled within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|This ale tastes like hobgoblin spit. Who's been pukin' in the barrel?|Warrior Sul.}}

==Description==
Sul had yellow-orange skin decorated with blue warpaint. He wore a suit of crudely-made [[plate armor]] that featured vicious spiked pauldrons and bracers decorated with bones.

==Possessions==
His preferred weapon was a two-handed [[battleaxe]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the cult of the Absolute launched a terrible raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn. It was unknown if Sul joined in on the assault, but he was most definitely present at the great feast held afterward at the Shattered Sanctum.
