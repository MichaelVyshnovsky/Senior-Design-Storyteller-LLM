Billiam Straodwall (
While Billiam was often doubtful of his works, he truly believed he was destined to be one of Faer√ªns greatest writers. He often lambasted himself with hurtful self-talk.
He was often found writing in his journal, distracting himself from his daily duties. 
After the city of Elturel was pulled down from Toril into the Nine Hells, in the , many Elturgardians fled their home for safer lands. Dara a priestess of Ilmater, and Ghorin, an elderly shepherd were two such individuals that rallied people to form a refugee caravan, en route to Baldurs Gate. Billiam was convinced to join the caravan by the miller Ippon and her assistant Pal, albeit only after they gathered materials for him to make travel journal to document their journey.
After the caravan finally made its way west towards Baldurs Gate, tragedy struck one night during the journey. Billiam was slaughtered in gruesome fashion, his throat slit and a strange marking was made on his chest in blood. The murderer was a secret cultist of Zariel who hid amongst the refugees, Vollis Foote. Billiams journal included a heroic description of their journey, but ultimately stopped on the night of his death.
