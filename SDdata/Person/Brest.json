        "History": "Brest was guided by visions sent from Bane to go to [[Zhentil Keep]], where he would accept an open seat on the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]] in the {{YearlinkName|752}} after [[Zhentar]] eliminated his rivals on the Council the previous year. In the {{YearlinkName|753}}, Brest founded a new temple to Bane called [[the Dark Shrine]] and served as High Priest.\n\nFollowing the deaths of Zhentar and [[Elephstron]] in {{Yearlink|753}}, Brest worked with the wizards of the Council to conceal the true nature of their deaths by means of [[spell]]s to prevent any form of magical divination from revealing the truth."
