Gurgon was an ogre who served the cult of the Absolute during the late 15 century DR.
Gurgon wore a simple loin cloth, strapped leather bracers, and cloth wraps around his rather large feet.
He was an ogre of few words. While some could consider him terse, Gurgon could communicate just as effectively with a few words in cases where others may have chosen more.
Gurgon was tasked with protecting the main doors of the Shattered Sanctum, a ruined Sel√ªnite temple that was taken over by the Absolutes cult.
