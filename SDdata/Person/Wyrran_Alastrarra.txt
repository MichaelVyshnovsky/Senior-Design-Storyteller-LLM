Wyrran Alastrarra was the mate of Countess Sarya Dlardrageth in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Wyrran was the most recent mate of Sarya.
Wyrran hailed from Evermeet but was exiled for trafficking with fiends a century before. He went to Luskan and joined the Arcane Brotherhood.
Wyrran was then captured by the daemonfey together with some members of the Company of the Jaded Heart. Interesting in the breeding experiments conducted by Sarya Dlardrageth, Wyrran plotted to be formally adopted into House Dlardrageth and become Saryas consort.
