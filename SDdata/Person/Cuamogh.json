        "Possessions": "Cuamogh was one of the most intelligent and the strongest Batiri of her tribe. She eyes betrayed the woman's intelligence, and, unlike her kin, she was willing to negotiate and make deals with outsiders.",
        "History": "Cuamogh's tribe was the sworn enemy of the neighboring Batiru [[Stone Knives tribe]]. At some point in or before {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Stone Knives stole Shattered Spear's namesake revered heirloom, and in retaliation, the Spears drove the Knives out of their home in the jungles of the [[Samarlogh]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a group of adventurers allied with a merchant from [[Samargol]] became involved in the Batiri conflict. Cuamogh was in possession of a priceless flawless [[gem]] that a merchant from Samargol desired, and the Batiri knew its value. She offered the gem in exchange for retrieval of her tribe's heirloom - the ''broken spear'', hidden away in an abandoned [[yuan-ti]] temple.\n\nCuamogh's fate and the outcome of the Bariri hostilities remained unrecorded, but it was known that by way of the artifact's retrieval or through slaughter, the adventures were able to retrieve Shattered Spear tribe's flawless gem of the [[tiefling]] merchant [[Vadin'ya]]."
