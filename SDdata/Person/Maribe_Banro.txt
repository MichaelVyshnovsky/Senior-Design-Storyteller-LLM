Maribe Banro was a human priest of Amaunator who stayed for a time at the Ball and Chain tavern on the docks of the Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR.
Maribe had dark skin, brown eyes, and shoulder-length black hair. She wore a suit of chain mail with golden designs, and a large symbol of Amaunator.
Like other Amaunatori priests including Dai Rolno, Adara Semple, and Karie Leddle, Maribe arrived at Wheloon to try and improve the situation. In particular, she offered healing and other restorative magic to those in need.
