Drauthtar Inskirl was a Zhentarim veteran mage in the mid-14 century DR.
He wore a black robe.
He was loyal, and found his thrills as they came.
He knew some sort of killing curse, which he felt confident could do harm even to Manshoon. He could scry on and speak out of thin air, presumably through spells. At least one of his spells was a strongly destructive one, unwise to cast within a confined space.
He often spied on his underlings.
Drauthtar was feared by his underlings, Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle. He himself reported to Eirhaun Sooundaeril, though he didnt know the Maimed Wizards last name until days before his own death.
Per the forces of Hulrivior, Drauthtar was a veteran of internal Zhentarim skirmishes.
Drauthtar largely approved of his underlings choice of moments not to snatch spellfire, though privately he thought they did so out of terror. He reported at some point to Eirhaun Sooundaeril, his immediate superior, only to find out Hesperdan had been spying on them.
Hlael Toraunt was later found by Shandril, who created some sort of transdimensional tunnel using her spellfire and pursued Drauthtar through it. She struck him down with spellfire though he managed to teleport away, he was mortally wounded. His teleport target was High Lord Manshoons throne room, where he spat out a warning. He then attempted a killing curse on Manshoon, but wasnt able to complete it before he died of his wounds.
