'''Drauthtar Inskirl''' was a [[Zhentarim]] veteran mage in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He wore a black robe.

==Personality==
He was loyal, and found his thrills as they came.

==Abilities==
He knew some sort of killing curse, which he felt confident could do harm even to [[Manshoon]]. He could scry on and speak out of thin air, presumably through spells. At least one of his spells was a strongly destructive one, unwise to cast within a confined space.

==Activities==
He often spied on his underlings.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|23|2}}

==Relationships==
Drauthtar was feared by his underlings, [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|175-176|11}} He himself reported to [[Eirhaun Sooundaeril]], though he didn't know the Maimed Wizard's last name until days before his own death.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|309|19}}

==History==
Per the forces of Hulrivior, Drauthtar was a veteran of internal [[Zhentarim]] skirmishes.

Drauthtar largely approved of his underlings' choice of moments not to snatch spellfire,{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|207-208|13}} though privately he thought they did so out of terror. He reported at some point to Eirhaun Sooundaeril, his immediate superior, only to find out [[Hesperdan]] had been spying on them.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|273|16}}

Hlael Toraunt was later found by [[Shandril]], who created some sort of transdimensional tunnel using her spellfire and pursued Drauthtar through it. She struck him down with spellfire; though he managed to teleport away, he was mortally wounded. His teleport target was High Lord Manshoon's throne room, where he spat out a warning. He then attempted a killing curse on Manshoon, but wasn't able to complete it before he died of his wounds.
