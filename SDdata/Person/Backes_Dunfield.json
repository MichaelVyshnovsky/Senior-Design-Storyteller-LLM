        "mainbody": "'''Backes Dunfield''' was the bartender of the [[Wayside Inn]] in the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]]. He was secretly a member of a [[Talos]] cult.",
        "Description": "Backes, a [[human]] male, had scars and a twisted grin on his face, and wore a trident-shaped necklace around his neck.",
        "Relationships": "Backes had swiftly established himself as an useful assistant to Martisha, the owner of the Wayside Inn, just six months after making her acquaintance. However, his true allegiance was to [[Fheralai Stormsworn]], not Martisha. The blacksmith [[Teega]], a fellow member of the Talos cult, was a long-time friend of Backes.",
        "History": "Backes used to be a pirate but left that life behind at some point. He joined the cult of Talos lead by Fheralai Stormsworn and eventually became one of her lieutenants. Backes then infiltrated the Wayside Inn, gaining the trust of the owner Martisha Vinetalker. In secret, he converted more of her employees to the Talos cult.\n\n''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], the Wayside Inn was attacked by [[undead]] that had been created by a cult of [[Myrkul]] competing with the Talos cult for influence in the region. A group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.\n\nLater, Backes took over the inn for the Talos cult. The guests of the inn were impaled as sacrifices to the Stormbringer. Backes and his underlings tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos and summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn in the process. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able to stop the ritual in time. However, the Talos cultists successfully kidnapped [[Tarbin Tul]], a local bard."
