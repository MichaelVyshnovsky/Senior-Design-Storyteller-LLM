        "mainbody": "Gauntlet,  Green Regent\nKalahar Twohands was a half-elf fighter and the well-respected High Lord of the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the 1370s DR. He was previously the Green Regent, a Chosen of Mielikki, over 1344â€“1348 DR and one of Loudwaters Gauntlets in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nServing as a Gauntlet, Kalahar Twohands was one of the joint commanders of the Loudwater militia. He served under the command of High Lord Nanathlor Greysword.\nOn Shieldmeet of the , Kalahar Twohands was chosen to be the next Green Regent.The date is not specified, but can be inferred from this being a Shieldmeet year immediately preceding the events of 1347 DR. Green Regents are only selected on Shieldmeet.\nIn the , Kalahar led the Scions of the Green Regent against a great storm elemental known as the Tempest that had been summoned by Talassan priests to devastate Llorkh and Orlbar. After fierce fighting against the cult amidst a thunderstorm atop a mountain in the Greypeaks, Kalahar reversed the spell that had summoned the storm elemental, ending its threat. The leaderless cult dispersed and was broken, and Kalahar earned himself the respect of the Delimbiyr Vale.This is 25 years before a setting date of 1372 DR, estimated to be 1347 DR.\nKalahar retired as Green Regent on Shieldmeet of the .Again, this is inferred from being the next Shieldmeet year.\nLater, he held the position of Gauntlet of Loudwater by 1357 DR and remained in the role through the 1360s DR.\nDuring the Night of the Blood Moon in the , both Gauntlets Kalahar and Harazos Thelbrimm happened to be out of the city when Malar-worshiping lycanthropes assaulted Loudwater for two nights straight. Kalahar and Harazos returned in time for the third night and organized the defense of the city. Shortly after, Nanathlor Greysword passed away and Kalahar became the High Lord of Loudwater, while Harazos remained as Gauntlet.\nThe Gray Migration of the High Forest orcs in the , which saw them settling in Loudwater but facing prejudice and murder, led Kalahar to make the \"Decree of Reception\", which gave any orcs who entered Loudwater legal rights similar to citizens. Though some in Loudwater were confused by his generosity, they largely respected his order.\nHe had a son, Velvred Twohands, and a cousin, Nardine Twohands.\nAccounts varied on where Harazos got his distinctive facial scar some said it was inflicted by a champion of the Zhent-serving Mayor of Llorkh, Geildarr Ithym, while others claimed it was made by High Lord Kalahar Twohands himself."
