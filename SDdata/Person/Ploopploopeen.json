        "mainbody": "'''Ploopploopeen''' was a [[kuo-toa]] archpriest and ruler of [[Sloobludop]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Ploopploopeen was a good leader for his people, even tolerating occasional dissidents like [[Shuushar]], but he was not forgiving of any who would destroy the peace of his community, even his daughter. He was also smart, capable of elaborating complex plans.",
        "History": "Ploopploopeen quietly ruled the village of Sloobludop on the [[Darklake]] as both their spiritual and temporal leader, until his daughter [[Bloppblippodd]] told him that she had been contacted by a new god, [[Leemooggoogoon]] the Deep Father (in truth, the [[demon lord]] [[Demogorgon]]), and began to spread her new religion among the kuo-toa. Soon, she had gathered so many followers to her that her father Ploopploopeen started to make plans to reclaim his position. He asked a party of adventurers who had escaped from [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] to help infiltrate Leemooggoogoon's temple disguised as sacrifices to disrupt the upstart faction's rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult.\n\nPloopploopeen and his son [[Glooglugogg]], with some guards and the adventurers, went to Leemooggoogoon's temple, telling [[Bloppblippodd]] that they had accepted her supremacy and offering the adventurers as sacrifices. She was pleased with her victory over her father and, after sacrificing the [[duergar]] [[Hemeth]], she went to sacrifice the adventurers. At that time, the adventurers and Ploopploopeen and his warriors attacked her and her lieutenants. At this point, however, \"Leemooggoogoon\" rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present."
