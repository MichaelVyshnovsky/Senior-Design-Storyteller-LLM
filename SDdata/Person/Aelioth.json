        "mainbody": "'''Master Aelioth''', sometimes misspelled as '''Aeolith''', was an ambitious [[Red Wizard]] and [[necromancer]] of [[Thay]], who served [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] during her mission to the [[Dragonbone Vale]] of the [[Sword Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Master Aelioth joined [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] in her quest that led the Red Wizards to be allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He traveled to the Dragonbone Vale, driven by the ambition to escalate his station in Thay. The [[wizard]] used his necromantic knowledge to develop the ''[[malignant conduit]]'' that served to spread foul magic and siphon energy of the living into the [[Netherese]] ''[[mythallar]]'', corrupted by Valindra and her Cult of the Dragon allies. Master Aelioth's ''malignant conduits'' empowered the said ''[[Scaleblight Mythallar]]'', allowing Valindra Shadowmantle to create a fully-powered ''[[mythal]]'' over the [[Scaleblight Summit]]. Aelioth, however, planned to betray Valindra and the Cult of the Dragon, taking control of the ''mythal'' and creating a new center of Thayan power, eventually overpowering [[zulkir]]s [[Szass Tam]] and Valindra.\n\nSubsequently, the creation of the ''mythal'' was thwarted by [[adventurer]]s from [[Neverwinter]], [[Elminster]], and the alliance of the [[Sword Coast]] factions. Master Aelioth himself was defeated and possibly killed in the process."
