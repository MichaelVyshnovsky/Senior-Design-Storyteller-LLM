Kor was a patron of the Cutters Dip tavern in Yhaunn in the late 14 century DR.
He was a big and surly man.
Kor was friends with a few other unpleasant individuals at the Dip, including the bandits Stag and Drik, the old lecher Noyle, and the half-mad Lahumbra Sashtyn.
In Eleasis of 1373 DR, Kor was drawn into a fight between the undercover priestess Feena Archwood and her old foes Stag and Drik. Though Kor wanted to stay out of it, the tussle grew and antagonized him as well, culminating in Feena being trapped in a boisterous round of Dips Stagger. The population of the Dip had her at their mercy until she was unexpectedly rescued by the Sharran Keph Thingoleir, who escorted her out of the tavern under the glower of Kor and his company.
