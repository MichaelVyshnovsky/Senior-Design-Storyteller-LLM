'''Ravaedrin''' was a [[Zhentarim]] who survived combat with [[The Simbul]] at some point prior to {{yearlink|1372}}, only to be summoned by her on that year.

==Abilities==
He knew of a method to convert flames to acid.

==Possessions==
He had wands.

==History==
At some point in the decades prior to {{yearlink|1372}}, Ravaedrin fought [[The Simbul]] and survived; unknown to him, she'd thrust some of her blood into his body, where it had lodged, making him vulnerable to her ''[[blood ring]]'' spell later on. She used the spell in {{yearlink|1372}}, calling him to her service in [[Avernus]]. She later ended the summon, returning him to wherever he had been.
