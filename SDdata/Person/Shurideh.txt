Shurideh was a dragonborn of Abeir, a descendant of Khorsaya, and an ancestor of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
Shurideh was the twin sister of Iskdara.
Shurideh was one of the heroines of the dragonborn rebellion. Alongside her sister Iskdara, she fought and killed the silver dragon Asativarainuth at the battle of Arambar Gulch, obtaining the powerful artifact known as the Eye of Blazing Rorn.
Shurideh was also one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in battle of the Crippled Mountain. Alongside Iskdara, Reshvemi, and Thuchir, she infiltrated the Celestial Mountain to kill the dragon overlord Rhodrolytharnestrix.
Shurideh survived the final battle and was one of the founders of Tymanchebar, and presumably, she was one of the first matriarchs of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
