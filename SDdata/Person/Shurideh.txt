'''Shurideh''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], a descendant of [[Khorsaya]], and an ancestor of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]].

==Relationships==
Shurideh was the twin sister of [[Iskdara]].

==History==
Shurideh was one of the heroines of the [[dragonborn rebellion]]. Alongside her sister Iskdara, she fought and killed the [[silver dragon]] [[Asativarainuth]] at the [[battle of Arambar Gulch]], obtaining the powerful [[artifact]] known as the [[Eye of Blazing Rorn]].

Shurideh was also one of the dragonborn clan leaders who took part in [[battle of the Crippled Mountain]]. Alongside Iskdara, [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]], she infiltrated the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]] to kill the [[dragon]] overlord [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]].

Shurideh survived the final battle and was one of the founders of [[Tymanchebar]], and presumably, she was one of the first matriarchs of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.
