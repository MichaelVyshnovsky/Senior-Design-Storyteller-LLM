        "mainbody": "Nusair Darkul was a Red Wizard. He spied on Samas Kul at the Guild of Foreign Trade for the zulkir Nevron. In , he was slain by a dragon summoned by the Scalamagdrion, which his apprentice Saura Umakra had brought him from Skuld.\nNusair was tall, thin, handsome, and strong his head was shaved and decorated with tattoos. He often wore robes of red Shou silk, and black boots.\nLike many Red Wizards, Nusair Darkul was scheming and duplicitous, toadying to his superiors for favor. The mage also rather enjoyed choking his apprentice and lover, Saura Umakra, as well as duergar ale, and all things draconic. He was unwilling to sponsor her into the ranks, considering her Rashemi ascendance made her a promotion into the ranks of Red Wizards a politically dangerous nonstarter.\nNusair knew one spell that would strike a close foe in hellish fire, possibly firebrand.The reasoning for this tentative attribution is that the spell is assumed to be intended for close combat, and thus cannot be a fireball.\nHe carried a magical ring, possibly a ring of spell storing, which held a ball lightning spell.\nNusair Darkul was embedded in the Guild of Foreign Trade as Nevrons spy on Samas Kul. He also sometimes financied expeditions in search of draconic artifacts.\nNevron was his true master, though he nominally worked for Samas Kul. He had an apprentice, Saura Umakra, who was also his lover.\nBefore , Nusair Darkul was a spy for Nevron in the Guild of Foreign Trade in Bezantur.\nIn mid-Hammer of that year, he revealed to the zulkir Nevron that he had discovered the location of the Scalamagdrion, seeking to curry favor with the man. He sent his apprentice, Saura Umakra, to retrieve the tome from Skuld the wizard promised her that she could become a red wizard if she acquired it for him.\nShe returned no less than five days later with the Scalamagdrion, and the mage reneged in his promise. That evening, Nusair opened the tome, and a guardian emerged, attacking him after a short fight, the wizard was slain.\nThe searches for draconic artifacts that he financied were often the subject of rumours and jokes."
