'''Penny''' was an apprentice [[alchemist]] who worked in the city of [[Neverwinter]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Penny had a sister named [[Piniwin]] who was also learning the trade of an alchemist. They worked under a woman named [[Hazel]], who focused her efforts on studying the [[Blacklake]] sludge that appeared in the [[Blacklake District]] of their home city.

==History==
Following the [[siege of Neverwinter]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Penny went with Hazel and Penny to the Blacklake District to study the sludge. Later, Penny sought out [[adventurer]]s to help Hazel fight off the sludge-covered [[zombie]]s that were being summoned by [[Therzt]], the [[Chosen]] of [[Ghaunadaur]].
