'''Wyrin Bloodclaw''' was a [[mage]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]).

Wyrin Bloodclaw was reputed to be an accomplished hunter of both beasts and people. Wyrin began a pursuit of the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] (which sought to unify the war-torn Utter East through conquest). Learning of this, the leader went to the [[Realm of Lands]] and there faced Wyrin in a [[bloodforge]] battle.
