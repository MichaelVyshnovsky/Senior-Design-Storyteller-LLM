Wyrin Bloodclaw was a mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Wyrin Bloodclaw was reputed to be an accomplished hunter of both beasts and people. Wyrin began a pursuit of the leader of the Legendary Campaign (which sought to unify the war-torn Utter East through conquest). Learning of this, the leader went to the Realm of Lands and there faced Wyrin in a bloodforge battle.
