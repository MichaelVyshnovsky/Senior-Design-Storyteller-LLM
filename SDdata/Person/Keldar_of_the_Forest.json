        "mainbody": "'''Keldar of the Forest''' was a [[Human]] male [[priest]] of [[Silvanus]] who lived in the [[village]] of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] in [[the Vast]].",
        "History": "Keldar was a member of the band of [[adventurer]]s that slew the [[red dragon]] [[Halarglautha Firewings]], who once rampaged across the Vast. Keldar and the survivors took possession of the dragon's hoard of coins and decided to settle near the location of her lair, [[Dragon Falls (waterfall)|the Dragon Falls waterfall]]. They constructed themselves a stronghold and the village of Dragons Fall grew around them over four generations.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], Keldar was still living at the stronghold, though it was under new ownership and operating as the [[Inn of the Dragon]].",
        "Activities": "Keldar was Dragon Falls's resident priest.\n\nHe maintained a [[shrine]] to Silvanus that stood at the head of the falls though he more often ignored it."
