        "mainbody": "Keldar of the Forest was a Human male priest of Silvanus who lived in the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast.\nKeldar was a member of the band of adventurers that slew the red dragon Halarglautha Firewings, who once rampaged across the Vast. Keldar and the survivors took possession of the dragons hoard of coins and decided to settle near the location of her lair, the Dragon Falls waterfall. They constructed themselves a stronghold and the village of Dragons Fall grew around them over four generations.\nBy 1370 DR, Keldar was still living at the stronghold, though it was under new ownership and operating as the Inn of the Dragon.\nKeldar was Dragon Fallss resident priest.\nHe maintained a shrine to Silvanus that stood at the head of the falls though he more often ignored it."
