Many of the Evereskan moon elf nobility were so shocked by this they relocated their estates to the other side of the valley.\nPleufan was ancient for an elf, and was reputed to have hunted in the Far Forest when it covered most of the Backlands.\nIn the , Pleufan and his fellow priests tended to elves of the Tomb Guard that encountered a group of phaerimm beneath the Greypeak Mountains. After tomb guardian Takari Moonsnow was injected with a phaerimm larva, Huntsman Trueshot learned the process of its removal, that is, by excision of the juvenile grub."
