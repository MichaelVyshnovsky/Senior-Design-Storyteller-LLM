'''Ishual Karanok''' was a member of [[House Karanok]] and a leader of [[Luthcheq]] in [[Chessenta]] in the late 14{{th}} and early 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was known for his courageous deeds and insightful leadership.

==History==
Ishual Karanok rose to prominence after [[Tchazzar]] disappeared in the chaos of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. He emerged as a war hero and leader who united the divided survivors of [[Luthcheq]]. He went on to battle rampaging monsters, [[aberration]]s sent by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], and opportunistic invaders and colonists from northern lands, and so kept Chessenta alive.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|70}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1399}}, Ishual Karanok merged the different coinages of the city-states of Chessenta into a single currency.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|69}}

In the early 1400s, Ishual fought his first true engagement with the Abolethic Sovereignty near the village of [[Samnur]]. Victorious, he and his forces drove the aboleths' minions back into the sea.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|75}}

After a time, when the fighting had lessened, he returned to Luthcheq and the Karanok family home. There, Ishual disbanded the murderous cult his family had led, arguing that their goal of destroying all arcane [[magic]] and its users had been achieved with [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra's]] death. Nevertheless, he kept their god [[Entropy]] as a symbol of power.

===Legacy===
Even a century after his death, Ishual was revered as a god-like hero by all Chessentans. Children grew up on stories of his exploits and aspired to be like him. [[Shala Karanok]], his sole descendant, ruled Luthcheq in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
