        "mainbody": "Qyraaptir the Bloodeye was a powerful beholder who once ruled the empire of Calimshan during its Third Age.\nQyraaptir was a beholder mage of intense power.\nSince the beginning of the Raor Dynasty at the start of the Third Age, circa , the beholders of the Alimir Hive had been in conflict with the empire of Calimshan. By , hordes of beholders, supported by an army of ogres and goblins swarmed every city of Calimshan. The current pasha at the time, Violir el Cajaan IX, believed that the One Sun would save his kingdom, but Violir was petrified on the steps of his gods temple in Calimport. Qyraaptir then \"sat\" on the throne.\nQyraaptirs bloody reign lasted 26 years, during which there was no peace between humans and beholders. Eventually, a band of warrior priests, following some of the gods of the modern Faer√ªnian pantheon, overturned the beholder rule in Calimshan. Qyraaptir was driven from its throne, and it and the other beholders fled back into the Alimir Mountains. The victorious priest-princes established a new Calishite dynasty, the Drakhons.\nQyraaptir, however, escaped destruction. It maintained power and rose up another horde of floating aberrations, leading not just one legion but the entirety of the beholder surface armies. In , Qyraaptir once again led a force of eye tyrrants against the Calishites of the Almraiven region, resulting in a war that lasted for around 200 years, before the beholders were finally driven back and reduced in number."
