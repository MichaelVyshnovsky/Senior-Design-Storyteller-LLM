        "mainbody": "'''Qyraaptir the Bloodeye''' was a powerful [[beholder]] who once ruled the empire of [[Calimshan]] during its [[Third Age of Calimshan|Third Age]].",
        "Description": "Qyraaptir was a [[beholder mage]] of intense power.",
        "History": "Since the beginning of the [[Raor Dynasty]] at the start of the Third Age, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-1900}}, the beholders of the [[Alimir Hive]] had been in conflict with the empire of Calimshan. By {{Yearlink|-1428}}, hordes of beholders, supported by an army of [[ogre]]s and [[goblin]]s swarmed every city of Calimshan. The current [[pasha]] at the time, [[Violir el Cajaan IX]], believed that the [[One Sun]] would save his kingdom, but Violir was [[Petrification|petrified]] on the steps of his god's temple in Calimport. Qyraaptir then \"sat\" on the throne.\n\nQyraaptir's bloody reign lasted 26 years, during which there was no peace between [[human]]s and beholders. Eventually, a band of warrior [[priest]]s, following some of the gods of the modern [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]], overturned the beholder rule in Calimshan. Qyraaptir was driven from its throne, and it and the other beholders fled back into the [[Alimir Mountains]]. The victorious priest-princes established a new Calishite dynasty, the [[Drakhon Dynasty|Drakhons]].\n\nQyraaptir, however, escaped destruction. It maintained power and rose up another horde of floating [[aberration]]s, leading not just one legion but the entirety of the beholder surface armies. In {{Yearlink|-1280}}, Qyraaptir once again led a force of eye tyrrants against the Calishites of the [[Almraiven]] region, resulting in a war that lasted for around 200 years, before the beholders were finally driven back and reduced in number."
