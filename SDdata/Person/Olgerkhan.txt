'''Olgerkhan''' was a [[half-orc]] warrior living in [[Palischuk]] in [[Vaasa]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Olgerkhan's features favored his [[orc]]ish half, with wide eyes in a tusked face; his lip twisted as a result of his huge, uneven canines; and his thick forehead being adorned with a singular bushy brow over bloodshot eyes. His nose was flat and crooked and his face was marked by small and uneven patches of hair. Olgerkhan was not very tall, somewhere between 5.5 and 6 feet (1.7 to 1.8 meters). He appeared much larger though, for his limbs and chest were thick and strong.

==Personality==
Although not overly smart, Olgerkhan was very polite, respectful, and protective of his love, [[Arrayan Faylin]].

==History==
Olgerkhan almost died defending Arrayan from being killed by [[Athrogate]] and [[Canthan Doolittle]]. He was saved by [[Artemis Entreri]] through the vampiric powers of Artemis' dagger, consuming the life-force of Canthan and giving it to Olgerkhan.<ref>
