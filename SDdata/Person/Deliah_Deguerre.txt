'''Deliah Deguerre''' was a commander and [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]).

Deliah was a rival to the commander of the [[Legendary Campaign]], who sought to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest. The two became caught up in a protracted conflict. Their two armies raced to [[Edenvale Castle]] for reinforcement, but ended their rivalry before its walls.
