Iraska, who was known to her derro subjects as the Slime King was a yuan-ti pureblood who ruled a clan of derro in the Underdark.
With the exception of canine teeth which looked like fangs, Iraska appeared as an elderly human female.
Iraska learned to open portals to the Far Realm, an ability which ingratiated her to the Far Realm obsessed derro.
Iraska was born into a small tribe of yuan-ti in the jungles of Southern Faerûn.  Because she was pureblood, she was nearly human in appearance and she was sent to the human city of Delzimmer as a spy.
Decades before 1479 DR she was abducted by derro of the Underdark and enslaved.  She manipulated her way to the top of the derro hierarchy and eventually became their leader, adopting the honorary title of Slime King.  In 1362 DR she ordered the derro to attack and enslave her former tribe out of spite.
In 1479 DR her great-great-grandaughter, Zaltys Serrat and Zaltys cousin Julen journeyed to the derro settlement with the intent of freeing Zaltys birth clan.  Iraska revealed Zaltys true nature as a yuan-ti pureblood and attempted to poison Julen.  Julen and Zaltys attacked Iraska and she was pushed through a Far Realm portal by Zaltys guard Krailash who had followed Zaltys trail to the derro village.
