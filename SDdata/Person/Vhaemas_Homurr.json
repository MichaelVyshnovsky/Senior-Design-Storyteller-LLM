        "History": "Born in [[1302 DR]], Vhaemas ruled for 35 years of peace until the start of the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] when Prince [[Vhaemas the Bastard]] allied with [[Iakhovas]].\n\nHowever, Iakhovas at last attacked [[Eadraal]] and King Vhaemas was forced to meet his son Vhaemas the Bastard in the battle. However, the two merfolk reconciled and together attacked Iakhovas, also helped by Princess [[Jian]]. They managed to destroy Iakhovas's trident but the monster killed the two younger merfolk and injured King Vhaemas.\n\nVhaemas remained conscious long enough to order his people to retreat toward Myth Nantar and after choosing his son [[Mirol]] as heir ordered him to join the [[Nantarn Alliance]] and stop Iakhovas. \n\nAfter arriving in Myth Nantar, he slipped into a coma and remained unconscious with few signs of awakening."
