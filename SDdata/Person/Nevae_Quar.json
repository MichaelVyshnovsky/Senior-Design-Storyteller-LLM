        "History": "Nevae Quar was still a young woman ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, when she met and swiftly befriended two [[rock gnome]] sisters [[Hylei Shadowhand|Hylei]] and [[Kylei Shadowhand]]. The trio spent some time traveling together until one fateful night when they came across a site of a [[goblin]] ambush in a forest outside [[Silverymoon]]. Three fellow adventurers [[S'feria Ranul]], [[Oagla'ta]], and [[Nyzeil Nighthammer]] were fighting for their lives, and the trio of friends rushed to help. With all the women dispatching bandits with natural ease, battling in synch, S'feria became enamored with the new allies' battle prowess and convinced them to join her troupe - [[Sisters of the Blood Moon]].\n\nIn 1310 DR, S'feria Ranul received a letter&mdash;a plea for help from the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Despite the promise of [[gold]] and fame, S'feria led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help."
