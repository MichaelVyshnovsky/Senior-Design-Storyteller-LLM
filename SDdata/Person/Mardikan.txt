'''Mardikan''' was a [[human]] [[priest]] of [[House of Helcaliant]] who worshiped [[Horus-Re]] in [[Mulhorand]] within the [[Old Empires]].

==Description==
The [[cleric]] was a strong and tall man with powerful religious and political ties.

==Personality==
Mardikan was an irrational and sometimes vengeful individual who cared deeply for his fellow clerics.

==Relationships==
As a priest of Horus-Re, Mardikan fought with his rival the vizier of Mulhorand [[Rezim]] to stop the clerics of [[Anhur]] from gaining favor with the [[Pharaoh]] [[Horustep III]].

==History==
Around [[1357 DR]], Mardikan feared the involvement of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] or the followers of [[Set]] becoming involved in the political struggles in Mulhorand.
