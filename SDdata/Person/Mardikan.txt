Mardikan was a human priest of House of Helcaliant who worshiped Horus-Re in Mulhorand within the Old Empires.
The cleric was a strong and tall man with powerful religious and political ties.
Mardikan was an irrational and sometimes vengeful individual who cared deeply for his fellow clerics.
As a priest of Horus-Re, Mardikan fought with his rival the vizier of Mulhorand Rezim to stop the clerics of Anhur from gaining favor with the Pharaoh Horustep III.
Around 1357 DR, Mardikan feared the involvement of the Red Wizards of Thay or the followers of Set becoming involved in the political struggles in Mulhorand.
