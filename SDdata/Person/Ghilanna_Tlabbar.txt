Ghilanna Tlabbar was the matron mother of House Faen Tlabbar of Menzoberranzan until her death in 1361 DR. 
Ghilllana won this position due to bloody fights with her six sisters after her mother and the former heir to the throne were slain in the battle of Mithral Hall in 1358 DR.
Ghilanna Tlabbar was described as "vicious" but she appeared quite delicate.
