}}
Har operated a [[Wheloon Prison boat|large boat]] with [[Frolo Sledge]], first moving cargo and later taking up service moving prospective inmates for [[Wheloon Prison]]. This including traversing the [[Starwater River]], [[Dragonmere]], and [[Wyvernflow]] to get between [[Eveningstar]] and [[Wheloon]], though the return trip had an empty cargo hold.
