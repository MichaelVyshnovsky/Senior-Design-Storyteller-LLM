        "mainbody": "'''Hellenrae''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.",
        "Personality": "Hellenrae simply hated everyone, even her fellow cultists, so she tried to avoid contact with others. She greatly despised weakness.",
        "Activities": "Hellenrae usually remained in her quarters unless orders came from [[Marlos Urnrayle]].",
        "History": "In her youth, Hellenrae was an orphan who lost her sight. She was accepted by a [[monastic order]], where was she trained as a [[monk]], but she distorted the monks' philosophy of self-denial and emptiness of mind to extremes, seeking to fill herself with the dark power she sensed sleeping in the earth and rock around her.\n\nSo, instead, Hellenrae joined the Cult of the Black Earth and rose to become the chief lieutenant of [[Marlos Urnrayle]].\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], Hellenrae, [[Qarbo]], and their minions disguised themselves as monks occupying the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]. Soon after, however, some adventurers infiltrated the monastery and in the end confronted and defeated Hellenrae."
