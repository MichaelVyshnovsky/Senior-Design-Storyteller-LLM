'''Corinna''' was a [[squirrel]] that lived in or around the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Me head its melting! I'm leaving before the damage is permanent.|Corinna, as understood by the ''[[speak with animals]]'' spell.}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Corinna and another squirrel named Spar encountered the [[tiefling]] woman [[Alfira]], singing and playing her lute at a secluded spot in the druid's grove. The nutty pair deemed her performance so terrifyingly awful that the two squirrel friends could barely stand to be in her presence.
