Azimer was a crazy lich in Myth Drannor in 1357 DR.
Azimer lived in Myth Drannor in the years before the Weeping War but refused to join the citys defenders.
In time, he became a lich. However, he descended into insanity and he still believed himself to be a living being, still directing his magic school. Azimer believed he was also surrounded by undefined enemies.
In 1357 DR, Lashan Aumersair, after his defeat in the Second inter-dale war, ventured into Myth Drannor with a few followers and ran into Azimer. Azimer believed Lashan to be one of his students. Instead, Lashan attacked him and the lich destroyed the former tyrant and his followers.
Azimer was still living in his School of Wizardry and usually kept busy following his madness. Unless provoked, he ignored adventurers. 
Azimer went insane long before turning into a lich.
Azimer in his madness believed that he had created a new potion formula that would give him immortality and godlike powers.
Azimer had a grell as pet.
