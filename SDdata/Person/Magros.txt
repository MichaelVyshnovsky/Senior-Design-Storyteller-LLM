Magros was a misfortune devil in the service of Levistus.
In 1486 DR, Magros was plotting with Sairché to use Farideh to acquire some divine sparks from the Chosens captured by the shadovar in the Lost Peaks. He had a spy inside the village.
However he also bargained with the Red Wizards of Thay Zahnya when Lorcan approached Magros offering to trade.
Magros played with both Lorcan and Sairché until at last he obtained from Zanhya the nar scepter of Alzrius, that was his true objective and went back in Hell.
