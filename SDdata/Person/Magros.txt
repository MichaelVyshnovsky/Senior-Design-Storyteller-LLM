'''Magros''' was a [[misfortune devil]] in the service of [[Levistus]].

==History==
In [[1486 DR]], Magros was plotting with [[Sairché]] to use [[Farideh]] to acquire some divine sparks from the [[Chosen]]s captured by the [[shadovar]] in the [[Lost Peaks]]. He had [[Tharra (Harper)|a spy]] inside the village.

However he also bargained with the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] [[Zahnya]] when [[Lorcan]] approached Magros offering to trade.

Magros played with both Lorcan and Sairché until at last he obtained from Zanhya the [[Narfell|nar]] [[scepter of Alzrius]], that was his true objective and went back in Hell.
