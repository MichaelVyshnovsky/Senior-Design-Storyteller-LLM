        "mainbody": "'Helda Silverstream''' was a [[dwarf]] just returned to [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1485 DR]].",
        "History": "Helda was born in [[Kelvin's Cairn]] in the union of [[Clan Silverstream]] and [[Clan Battlehammer]] and was the niece of [[Stokely Silverstream]]. At a young age, full of stories from her mother about the [[Companions of the Hall]], she traveled to [[Mithral Hall]].\n\nHelda later settled in [[Mirabar]], where she joined the [[Axe of Mirabar]], but usually wandered from [[Waterdeep]] to Icewind Dale to sell her works. In 1485 DR, alarmed by strange rumors about dissent against her uncle, Helda returned to the dale to check on the situation. She was probably involved in the conflict between Stokely and [[Baerick Hammerstone]]."
