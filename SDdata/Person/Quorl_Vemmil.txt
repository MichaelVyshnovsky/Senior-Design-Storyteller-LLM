'''Quorl Vemmil''' was a priest of [[Talona]] and the first Tessarch on the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Six]], the ruling council of [[Amn]], and Lord of [[House Vemmil]].

==Activities==
He was cruel man who used his family business of [[alchemy]], [[wine]], and [[ale]] supply to conceal an underground trade in [[narcotic]]s to the south and east.

Quorl died in [[1345 DR]] after he plotted to frame the Meisarch [[Thayze Selemchant]] by unleashing a plague in [[Keczulla]]. Thayze overcame the plot and forced Quorl and his priests to go to Keczulla, where they were killed, either by the plague, or other means.
