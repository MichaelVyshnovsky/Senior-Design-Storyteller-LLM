        "mainbody": "Kadumi was a young man of the Bedine people of Anauroch and the last surviving warrior of the Qahtan tribe.\nKadumi looked very much the youth that he was, with strong features that had not been weathered by the desert climate.\nWhile he tried to carry himself as a honorable warrior that followed the tradition of his people, his deeds were often a bit misguided. Due to his youth and lack of experience, he often \"acted the part\" of a noble Bedine warrior without the wisdom that accompanied considerable life experience. Ultimately though, Kadumi did what he felt was right to serve his family and honor the memory of his tribe.\nKadumi had one known brother Ajaman who was son of the Qahtani sheikh. The two had the same mother, the sheikhs second wife. By Ajamans marriage, Kadumi was step brother to Ruha, the exiled sorceress formerly of the Mtair Dhafir. Kadumi had mixed feelings towards Ruha on one hand he was honored to serve as the protector of his brothers widow, \nHe was also resentful Lander, the outlander agent of the Harpers with whom Ruha became quite close. Kadumi was angered by the fact they shared a connection so soon after the death of Ajaman.\nIn the , Kadumi completed the rite of manhood to became a true warrior of his tribe by claiming his first kill of another person. He then embarked upon his el asarad, the solitary ride across the desert on a camel that marked the momentous occasion, even managing to wrangle three camels from the Bordjias tribe. While Kadumi was on his journey, the entire Qahtani tribe save for a single other member was slain by the Zhentarim. Upon his return Kadumi met the tribes only other survivor, his sister-in-law Ruha. As tradition mandated, Kadumi swore to protect his brothers widow.\nThe pair traveled the desert searching out the camp of the Mtair Dhafir, Ruhas former tribe. After they met the Zhentarim agent Zarud, and Ruha encountered the outlander member of the Harpers called Lander, Kadumi was told be Sheikh Sabkhat his dedication to Ruhas safety was no longer needed. The young warrior was not deterred and remained by Ruhas side,\nescaping the wrath of the Zhentarim along with Lander when they launched an assault El Rahalat oasis.\nThe trio traveled across the Sword uniting the tribes of the Anauroch people against the Zhentarim invaders, from the home of the Bait Mahwa tribe at the Colored Waters oasis, across Atars Looking Glass to the Well of the Chasm, home of the Razhadi. Tension arose among the three, almost coming to a duel of honor between Kadumi and Lander. Ruha had none of their petty disagreements and made sure Kadumi knew that he only to act in a manner so as to earn her respect. \nKadumi fought bravely during the Battle of the Chasm, the first major combat between the Bedine and the Zhentarim, but suffered an injury to his head and fell on the battlefield. His unconscious body was recovered by Lander and brought to safety during the melee. \nAfter the battle, Kadumi was given the opportunity to ride with the Bedine warriors while Ruha and Lander continued on their own. Kadumi told the sheikhs of the Bedine he would rather remain with his sister-in-law and Lander, traveling with them across the Shoal of Thirst to the Sister of Rains, in order to recover the spellbook of Ruhas mentor Qohadar. When they reached the oasis, Kadumi sensed an intruder in their camp and acted quickly to protect the vulnerable Lander. Kadumi was cut down by a fatal blow from the blade of the Zhent assassin."
