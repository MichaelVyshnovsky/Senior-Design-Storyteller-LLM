Lord Bly Ruldegost was a proud and honorable member of the Knights of the Shield
While Ruldegost attempted to recruit other Waterdhavian nobles to his order, he did not believe in instituting a Knight of the Shield within the ranks of the Lords of Waterdeep, which put him at odds with his superiors.
Lord Bly was the regent for his young nephew, Detan.
He supported the creation of a new duchy in eastern Amn, based in Riatavin, to be headed by Lord Mundal Krimmevol, but desired Lord Mundal to become a member of the Knights and give assurance of increased trade links between Riatavin and the rest of Amn to the west.
