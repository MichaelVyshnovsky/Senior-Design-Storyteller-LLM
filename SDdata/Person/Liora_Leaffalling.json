        "mainbody": "'''Liora Leaffalling''' was a [[half-elf]] [[druid]] member of the [[Archdruid's Grove]], the druid circle of [[Mosstone]], ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Liora had distinctly sharp facial features. She was one of the most liked druids in Mosstone.",
        "History": "Liora Leaffalling was born out of an unlikely union of a [[human]] woman and father, a [[wild elf]] from [[Suldanessellar]]. She spent seventy years of her life as a beloved druid of the Archdruid's Grove, residing in Mosstone from ''circa'' [[1300 DR]]. During those years, she was surrounded mostly by humans and human companionship. Only closer to [[1370 DR]], she was accepted by her fathers' people. Eventually, she departed for Suldanessellar to study her [[fey]] heritage deep in the [[Forest of Tethir]]."
