        "mainbody": "Liora Leaffalling was a half-elf druid member of the Archdruids Grove, the druid circle of Mosstone, circa 1370 DR.\nLiora had distinctly sharp facial features. She was one of the most liked druids in Mosstone.\nLiora Leaffalling was born out of an unlikely union of a human woman and father, a wild elf from Suldanessellar. She spent seventy years of her life as a beloved druid of the Archdruids Grove, residing in Mosstone from circa 1300 DR. During those years, she was surrounded mostly by humans and human companionship. Only closer to 1370 DR, she was accepted by her fathers people. Eventually, she departed for Suldanessellar to study her fey heritage deep in the Forest of Tethir."
