Griggen Ekmiran was a shopkeeper in Skullport.
Griggen managed a shop for carpentry and woodworking. Most of his clients were taverns and watering holes, which were always in need of repairs.
In 1367 DR, some rumors claimed that he paid a gang to demolish his customers taverns until one of the rumormongers was found dead and the rumors stopped.
