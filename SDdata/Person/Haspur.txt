Haspur was a seer who lived in the city of Baldurs Gate during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a seer or prophet who would go into a trance, and was believed to be slightly deranged.
Before Nightal of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Haspur prophesied the artifact known as the Ring of Winter would be discovered again in the following year. While he was agitated during his trance, he awoke remembering nothing and could offer no clarification.
He was partially correct in his forecast, if off by a few years. The ring was later uncovered in a temple in Mezro, by Artus Cimber in 1362 DR.
