==Description==
Great King Mandoul was the ancient ruler of a region near Waterdeep. He was skilled in [[magic]], and resided in a castle, in which underneath was a vast cavern.

==History==
It is unknown when exactly the Great King Mandoul ruled over his kingdom. In the caverns below his kingdom, he had a room that could disorient and confuse his enemies. Before he expired, the king cast [[magic mouth|his magics]] upon a stone head on the entrance to his kingdom, bearing a message to all that would pass. Unfortunately, the glory of his kingdom didn't last as long as his magic, which still appeared to be functioning as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

The caverns of the region Mandoul once ruled became filled with several monsters, such as [[otyugh]]s, [[wight]]s, and [[carrion crawler]]s.

When [[Zhentarim]] and their allies posed as Waterdhavian guards in [[1358 DR]], they found this ancient cavern and made it their local base. That same year, the [[Heroes of Ascore]] were rescued by the [[sirine]]s and [[sea elves]] of the [[Trackless Sea]]. Their aquatic saviors knew of the entrance to the ancient dungeons, and told them that traversing it was their best shot at escaping Waterdeep undetected (as the heroes had been branded as villains). The heroes ventured into the ruins, and were spoken to by the stone head infused with the life-force of Mandoul.
