Mandoul was an ancient king of a region on the Sword Coast North near Waterdeep.
Great King Mandoul was the ancient ruler of a region near Waterdeep. He was skilled in magic, and resided in a castle, in which underneath was a vast cavern.
It is unknown when exactly the Great King Mandoul ruled over his kingdom. In the caverns below his kingdom, he had a room that could disorient and confuse his enemies. Before he expired, the king cast his magics upon a stone head on the entrance to his kingdom, bearing a message to all that would pass. Unfortunately, the glory of his kingdom didnt last as long as his magic, which still appeared to be functioning as of the 14 century DR.
The caverns of the region Mandoul once ruled became filled with several monsters, such as otyughs, wights, and carrion crawlers.
When Zhentarim and their allies posed as Waterdhavian guards in 1358 DR, they found this ancient cavern and made it their local base. That same year, the Heroes of Ascore were rescued by the sirines and sea elves of the Trackless Sea. Their aquatic saviors knew of the entrance to the ancient dungeons, and told them that traversing it was their best shot at escaping Waterdeep undetected (as the heroes had been branded as villains). The heroes ventured into the ruins, and were spoken to by the stone head infused with the life-force of Mandoul.
