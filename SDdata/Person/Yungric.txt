'''Yungric''' was a [[alchemist]] for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Yungric was known to be a stereotype of an old, mad, cackling alchemist. It was surprising that with all the mad concoctions, the man's eyebrows remained unsinged. Despite eccentricities, Yungric's skills as a miracle worker made his a popular alchemist for hire in Neverwinter.
