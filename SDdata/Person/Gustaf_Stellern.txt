'''Gustaf Stellern''', nicknamed '''Falcon the Hunter''', was the owner of a [[Falcon's hunting lodge|hunting lodge]] in [[Neverwinter Wood]] during the late 15th century [[DR]]. He catered to nobles from [[Neverwinter]] who were looking for a break from city life.

==Appearance==
Falcon was {{SI|6.6|ft|}} tall. He had broad shoulders and cold blue eyes. His hair was black and he sported a neatly trimmed beard. Falcon wore a fur-lined cloak over his [[studded leather]] armor.

==Personality==
Falcon showed no fear and appeared confident and casual even in difficult situations. He preferred living on the periphery of civilization to overcrowded city life. Falcon was a wine connoisseur and treated other people fairly and patiently. However, he had a deep hatred for [[orcs]]. He detested them so much that he hung the heads of killed orcs as trophies in his hunting lodge.

==Abilities==
Through his many years in Neverwinter Wood, Falcon became a survival expert and a skilled hunter and fighter. As an archer, he excelled with his [[longbow]] but was also proficient with the [[longsword]]. These skills earned him his nickname Falcon the Hunter.

==Possessions==
Falcon owned a pair of [[boots of elvenkind]]. His riding horse, a reliable gray [[horse|stallion]], was called Baatorius.

He had his own flag symbol: a black banner with a silver falcon insignia.

==History==
In his youth, Falcon fought in many wars, but retired to be a hunter and later proprietor of his lodge in Neverwinter Wood.

Following the appearance of the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the region, Falcon noticed an alliance of orcs from the south and a half-orc cult of [[Talos]] that gathered in the [[Woodland Manse]] not far from his hunting lodge. He hired some adventurers to make a preemptive strike against them. In retaliation, a band of twenty orcs attacked Falcon's hunting lodge. The [[anchorites of Talos]] also conjured [[Gorthok]] the Thunder Boar to aid the attack.
