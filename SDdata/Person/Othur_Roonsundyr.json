        "mainbody": "Othur Roonsundyr was a reclusive wizard in Skullport.\nOthur was the most militant recluse in the North. He did not like people, seeming to find no joy in anything that he or anyone else created. His soft side was touched only by the art and poetry of Kara-Tur.\nOthurs fields of study were runes, symbols, and ward magic. He was the greatest expert in Skullport about them, and one of the major scholars in these topics outside Candlekeep."
