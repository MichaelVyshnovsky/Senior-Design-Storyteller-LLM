'''Zensil of Westgate''' was an [[enchanter]] pirate who sailed on the ''[[Maelstrom (ship)|Maelstrom]]'' in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Personality==
The [[wizard]] was known as a soft spoken man.

==Abilities==
Zensil enjoyed bringing creatures of the sea into battles to help his shipmates, such as [[crocodile]]s, [[giant crab]]s, and on one occasion a [[giant sea snake]]. At the conclusion of each fight, Zensil would release his monstrous "allies" back into the deep.

==History==
Around [[1359 DR]], Zensil was the lieutenant and ally of [[Vurgrom|Vurgrom the Mighty]] and the key to his success: it was Zensil who [[charm]]ed small schools of vicious sea-creatures to aid Vurgrom in his raids.
