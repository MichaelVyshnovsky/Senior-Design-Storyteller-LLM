She managed to gain entrance into the city (possibly with the aid of her comrade [[Karie Leddle]]) and found her way to [[Harvest Hall]], where the [[Wheloon natives]] managed and protected their own part of the prison. From there, Adara sought assistance in investigating [[Shar Manor]], a stronghold of the [[Shadovar]] that she believed held a great threat. On reaching the Manor, she found a ritual being cast by a [[Sharran]] priest to extend the [[Shadowfell]]'s local influence further via the [[Shadowfell Nexus]], and slew the ritualist, thwarting one small part of the [[Netherese]] plans."
