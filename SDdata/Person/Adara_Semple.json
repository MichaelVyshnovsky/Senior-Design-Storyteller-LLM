        "mainbody": "Adara Semple was a Morninglord of Amaunator that visited the Wheloon Prison in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR during the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon.\nAdara was a light-skinned human woman who wore her blonde hair tied back. In the field, she wore a suit of chain mail, and carried a buckler and mace-like holy symbol of Amaunator.\nAdara was an extremely upbeat and cheerful woman, and sought only to help and uplift others (such as by smiting evil).\nLike many other priests of Amaunator including Dai Rolno and Maribe Banro, Adara was deeply concerned by the conditions inside Wheloon. She managed to gain entrance into the city (possibly with the aid of her comrade Karie Leddle) and found her way to Harvest Hall, where the Wheloon natives managed and protected their own part of the prison. From there, Adara sought assistance in investigating Shar Manor, a stronghold of the Shadovar that she believed held a great threat. On reaching the Manor, she found a ritual being cast by a Sharran priest to extend the Shadowfells local influence further via the Shadowfell Nexus, and slew the ritualist, thwarting one small part of the Netherese plans."
