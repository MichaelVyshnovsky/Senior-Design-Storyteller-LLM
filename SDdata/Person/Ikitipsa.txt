'''Ikitipsa''' was an evil [[bent priest]]ess in the [[Pasocada Basin]] in [[Maztica]].

==History==
In [[1359 DR]], Ikitipsa sent a [[farastu]] onto the [[Sun Trail]] to stop the Gilded Priest [[Koyisqatapi]], in order to bring down the [[Azuposi]] nation.

In [[1362 DR]], the adventurers of [[Sozarro]]'s expedition defeated the farastu. Later, she conspired with some evil Azuposi and a tribe of [[ogre]]s to kill the adventurers.
