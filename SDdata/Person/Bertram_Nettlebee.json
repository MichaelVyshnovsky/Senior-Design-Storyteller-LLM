        "mainbody": "'''Bertram Nettlebee''' was the son of [[Wiggan Nettlebee]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.",
        "Personality": "Bertram was a very fanatical believer of the cult, and full of bluster. However, he had no clear idea of the true objective of the cult.",
        "Relationships": "Like his father, Bertram was fascinated by the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] and joined the cult, becoming an initiate. Thanks to the cultists, the Nettlebee became ever richer.",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], after some adventurers had defeated the earth cultists at the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]], the cult's leaders ordered Wiggan and Bertram to set a trap to kill the adventurers. They spread rumors about a \"fire witch\" in their fields, burning an old [[Uthgardt]] barrow mound, in order to lure the adventurers.\n\nWhen the adventurers came to investigate the mound, Wiggan summoned an [[earth elemental]] to destroy the mound and kill all inside. However, this also awoke a dead chieftain of the [[Elk tribe]], [[Javor]]. Javor rose as a [[revenant]] wanting revenge against Wiggan and Bertram. Somehow, the adventurers resolved the situation and Bertram was killed."
