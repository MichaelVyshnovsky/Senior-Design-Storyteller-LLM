'''Raven''' was a [[Vaasan]] man that accompanied [[Vala Thorsdotter]] along her journey to [[Western Heartlands|the west]] to seek out [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] in early 1370s [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was a relative of Sable, a woman that was acquainted with Prince Melegaunt during the late 13{{th}} century DR.

==History==
The Vaasan expedition ended when Vala and her fellow Vaasans arrived at the [[Greypeak Mountains]] on [[Nightal 20]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. Raven remained with the group during their initial encounter with [[elves]] of the [[Tomb Guard]], an attack from a [[phaerimm]] behind the [[Sharn Wall]], and onward as they entered into the city of [[Evereska]].
