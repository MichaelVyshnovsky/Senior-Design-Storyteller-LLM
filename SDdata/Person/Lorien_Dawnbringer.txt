Lorien Dawnbringer was a priestess of Sune in Waterdeep.  She was a very good friend of Ilira Nathalan and the two were rumored to be lovers although its doubtful they had a physical relationship because Iliras spellscar prevented her from touching another person.  Lorien spent time skulking around Downshadow, healing adventurers who had taken on more than they could handle.
In 1479 DR in an attempt to gain a measure of revenge on Ilira, Beshabas high priest, Lilten, had Lorien killed by one of his minions, the dwarf Rath.
