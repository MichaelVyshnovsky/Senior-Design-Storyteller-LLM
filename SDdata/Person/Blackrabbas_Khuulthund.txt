Blackrabbas Khuulthund was a Tethyrian sage inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He had a reputation for being a pompous individual who enjoyed the sound of his own voice and praising himself. This caused his reputation as a sage to suffer.
Blackrabbas Khuulthund studied the birds, insects, herbs, and flowers of the Sword Coast and northwest Faer√ªn. He spent much of his time within the Font of Knowledge in the Castle Ward and rented a house nearby.
