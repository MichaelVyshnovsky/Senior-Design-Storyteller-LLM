'''Victoria''' was one of the [[elf|elven]] war party leaders of [[N'Vaelahr]], a covert branch of the [[Akh'Velahr]] military in the days of the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Victoria possessed some of the best [[enchanted]] equipment of the N'Vaelahr. Her weapons were the ''[[Arrowflight of Angels]]'' and the ''[[dagger of angels]]''. She wore ''[[Victoria's boots of beguiling gait]]'', ''[[Victoria's gloves of electric touch]]'', ''[[Victoria's leather corset]]'' into battle.

==History==
During the fateful fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the Weeping War ([[711 DR|711]]â€“[[714 DR]]), Victoria led a band of N'Vaelahr into the depths of the [[Elven Catacombs]] against one of the Dark Generals of the [[Army of Darkness]], the creature known as [[Drenofiend]]. However, Victoria and her squad were slaughtered, caught unaware by [[Greyanna Freth|Greyanna]], the youngest daughter of Matron Mother [[Faeurdyn Freth|Faeurdyn]] of the [[drow]] [[House Freth]], who'd allied themselves with the Army of Darkness against the City of Song.

In [[1369 DR]], Victoria's enchanted gear and her diary were looted from the dead by the returned drow of House Freth, who had allied with the enemies of Myth Drannor once again, this time the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Victoria's gear was readied for transport into the [[Underdark]] by the marauding drow. However, the drow operations were disbanded by the [[Veiled Ones]] of [[Phlan]], who once heard Victoria's ghostly voice asking them to avenge her death and slay Greyanna Freth.
