Sitt '''Rahmah al-Zahir''' was the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]]'s favorite maternal aunt in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

== Activities ==
Rahmah was a member of the [[Magical Legion]] but spent too much time in politics to fully develop her power.

Her magical training was just an elaborate ruse to disguise her true calling as the Grandmother of the [[Soft Whisper]]. Rahmah and the Soft Whisper made sure that other [[Zakharan]] rulers who did not work to further the Grand Caliph's policies were visited by [[Holy slayer]]s.

==Possessions==
Much of her outward magical prowess was courtesy of a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'' supplied by the [[Alyana al-Azzazi|Grand Vizier]].

== Relationships ==
Rahmah was lifelong friends with the Grand Vizier Alyana al-Azzazi.

== History ==
Rahmah studied at the magical university at [[Qadib]].
