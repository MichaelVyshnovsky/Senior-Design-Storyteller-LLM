Sitt Rahmah al-Zahir was the Grand Caliphs favorite maternal aunt in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Rahmah was a member of the Magical Legion but spent too much time in politics to fully develop her power.
Her magical training was just an elaborate ruse to disguise her true calling as the Grandmother of the Soft Whisper. Rahmah and the Soft Whisper made sure that other Zakharan rulers who did not work to further the Grand Caliphs policies were visited by Holy slayers.
Much of her outward magical prowess was courtesy of a ring of spell storing supplied by the Grand Vizier.
Rahmah was lifelong friends with the Grand Vizier Alyana al-Azzazi.
Rahmah studied at the magical university at Qadib.
