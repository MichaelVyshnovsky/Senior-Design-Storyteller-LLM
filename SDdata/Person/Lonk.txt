Lonk the Sane was a dwarf wizard who served as the caretaker of Spellhold in 1369 DR.
Lonk held the role of caretaker at the Residence for the Magically Deviant, where he was charged with tending to the inmates and keeping them docile. He did this through a combination of cajoling, baked goods of his own creation, and powerful magic should things resort to violence.
Lonk was a wizard who specialized in conjuration, and was very powerful. The dwarf conjurer was able to cast the most complicated spells, such as power word, kill and imprisonment.
In 1369 DR, Lonk served as a caretaker at Spellhold. He was spared when the newly arrived inmate Jon Irenicus broke out of captivity and butchered most of the Cowled Wizards residing at the asylum. Only Lonk and the former director, Wanev, whom Irenicus drove mad and imprisoned among the other inmates, were spared.
Lonk continued to serve under Jon Irenicus, fearful for his life. After Gorions Wards adventuring party were imprisoned in the dungeon beneath Spellhold, they fought their way back to the main floor of the asylum. Upon re-entry, Lonk was the first individual they encountered, but his fate after that was unknown.
