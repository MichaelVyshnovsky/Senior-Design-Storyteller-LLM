|Lonk, on his role at [[Spellhold]]
}}
==Description==
Lonk held the role of caretaker at the Residence for the Magically Deviant, where he was charged with tending to the inmates and keeping them docile. He did this through a combination of cajoling, baked goods of his own creation, and powerful [[magic]] should things resort to violence.

==Abilities==
Lonk was a wizard who specialized in [[conjuration]], and was very powerful. The dwarf [[conjurer]] was able to cast the most complicated [[spell]]s, such as ''[[power word, kill]]'' and ''[[imprisonment]]''.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Lonk served as a caretaker at Spellhold. He was spared when the newly arrived inmate [[Jon Irenicus]] broke out of captivity and butchered most of the [[Cowled Wizards]] residing at the asylum. Only Lonk and the former director, [[Wanev]], whom Irenicus drove mad and imprisoned among the other inmates, were spared.

Lonk continued to serve under Jon Irenicus, fearful for his life. After [[Gorion's Ward]]'s adventuring party were imprisoned in the dungeon beneath Spellhold, they fought their way back to the main floor of the asylum. Upon re-entry, Lonk was the first individual they encountered, but his fate after that was unknown.
