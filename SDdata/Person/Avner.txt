'''Avner of Hartsvale''' was a thief and scout in [[Hartsvale]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Avner was an orphan living in [[Hartwick]] in [[Hartsvale]]. He lived as a thief from a young age until the [[firbolg]] [[Tavis Burdun]] opened his eyes to honest work. Avner changed his life and become one of the most reliable scouts of the vale. At last he died saving his queen's child.

However, problems arose when his soul arrived in the [[Fugue Plane]]. The new god of death, [[Kelemvor]], decided to send Avner's soul to [[Torm]]'s realm, as Avner died in the line of duty, but [[Mask]] arrived to explain that Avner was one of the [[False]], having always honored the giant goddess [[Diancastra]], whom Mask had been impersonating. In order to save Avner, Kelemvor proclaimed the young thief his Seraph of Death. 

Eventually, it was discovered that Avner was an unwitting pawn in Mask's a plot to prove Kelemvor favored good aligned mortals and thus discredit him. When Kelemvor came to realize the truth of Mask's accusation, he agreed that he had abused his position as the god of death, and in an effort to rectify this, Kelemvor begin reviewing his past judgements of the souls of the dead. As part of this process, Kelemvor gave Avner's soul to Mask, who offered to make Avner his Seraph of Thieves if the former Seraph of Death could free Mystra from her imprisonment by Helm, believing that Avner could never succeed. Avner accepted the offer, and when he succeeded, Mask honored his promise, making Avner the Seraph of Thieves.
