        "mainbody": "Kristoffen was the dragonborn captain of the Ice Floe in the late 15 century DR.\nKristoffen, a white dragonborn, was cold, calculated, and solemn.\nKristoffen routinely cruised the Sea of Swords, hauling goods for merchants as well as passengers. His ship, a galley called Ice Floe, was specifically equipped for the frigid seas of the far north.\nKristoffen was friends with Valdi Estapaar, a member of the Leilon town council. He was secretly a member of the Cult of Talos.\nCirca 1491 DR, the Leilon town council was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of adventurers to the Thunder Cliff Caves. The caves at the foot of the Thunder Cliffs were used as a hideout by the Cult of Talos, which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. Kristoffen tried to use his friendship with councilor Valdi Estapaar to get the job but had to compete for it with Stands in Tar, the tabaxi captain of the Dancing Delight. Secretly, he himself was a follower of Talos. However, Kristoffen couldnt stop the adventurers from defeating the cultists in the caves."
