        "mainbody": "ikos was a young centaur of Guard in the Barony of Bloodstone in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was the son of Shinar, one of the village elders.\nVikos displayed some of his ancestors wildness in his attitude and outlook. He was an eager student of history and a gifted writer, but was very modest about his talents.\nIn 1358 DR, Vikos broke one of his legs when he became trapped under a tree in Bloodstone Pass. He remained pinned there for two days, but was saved by Gareth Dragonsbanes party. When the party subsequently arrived in the centaur village of Guard later that winter, Vikos was there to vouch for them."
