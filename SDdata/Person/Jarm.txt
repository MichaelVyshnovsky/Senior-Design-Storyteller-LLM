'''Jarm''' was an [[evil]] [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who excelled at [[spell]] duels.

==Description==
This inventor was a methodical and efficient killer; whenever he faced competition, he would make sure that they disappeared. Even mages who were just passing through his hometown of [[Earsome]] would find themselves on their deathbed.

==Relationships==
Jarm had many complicated relationships. In spite of his general lean towards evil, he would put himself on the line against the invasion of his hometown by [[Hidden Forest]] [[orc]]s. One of his nemeses was [[Shastin]], a [[good]] [[priest]] of [[Mystryl]], but, unlike his other opponents, he didn't have the resolve to face her. Another one of his enemies was the skilled arcanist, [[Volhm]], a creator of powerful [[evocation]] spells.

==History==
Jarm was born in Earsome in {{YearlinkConvert|1841|NY}}. After defending his home, and taking out his enemies, he sought out Volhm's spell, ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and the two engaged in a spell duel to the death in {{YearlinkConvert|1898|NY}}. Even though he was facing a senior arcanist who specialized in evocation, the masterful Jarm succeeded, and eliminated Volhm. After his victory, Volhm's chaotic students, in rage, rushed Jarm. Jarm, however, killed each of them, one by one.

Years later, he focused on spell development, and invented ''[[magic jar]]'', ''[[summon swarm]]'', ''[[spectral hand]]'', and ''[[irritation]]''.It is never explained how it was possible that Jarm invented ''legend lore'' eleven years after his death. It is possible that one of the dates is wrong, either the spell invention date or the date of his death.
