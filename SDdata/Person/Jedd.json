        "mainbody": "'''Jedd''' was the Captain of the [[barge]] called ''[[The Topside]]'' that traveled the [[Fire River]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "By that time, Jedd was an aged man whose rugged appearance was the telltale sign of many years of travel and an outdoorsman's life. Despite that, he was a pleasant and charismatic man whose presence possessed a comforting quality. A spark in his mind and aged articulation indicated Jedd being a smart man.",
        "History": "After a long and strenuous career as an [[adventurer]] and a caravan guard and witnessing plenty of death, Jedd settled down in the Vast and took on the calm profession of a barge captain. He greatly preferred the comforting life of a captain and the river's solitude to the struggle of being a mercenary. Despite being slowed and relaxed, Jedd was still ready for unexpected dangers and kept a [[cutlass]] and a [[dagger]] stashed inside his [[bedroll]].\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, Jedd's barge, ''The Topside'', had a crew of nine. At all times, three of them ensured the barge stayed on course while the rest focused on other tasks or took breaks. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Captain Jedd was hired by [[Shauna Morden]], the proprietor of the [[Tavern of the Garden]], to transport a band of adventurers from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] to the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]]. Along the several-days-long journey, Jedd entertained his passengers by telling them the story of the [[red dragon]] [[Firewings]] and the group of heroes who slew the beast, giving the name to the village of Dragon Falls."
