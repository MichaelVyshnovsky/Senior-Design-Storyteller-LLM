        "mainbody": "'''Art Cullagh''' was a member of the [[Flaming Fist]] who served [[Grand Duke]] [[Eltan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Mm, mm, Thaniel and me are...<br/>Climb, climb, climbing up a tree...''|Catatonic Flame Cullagh}}",
        "Description": "Art was a [[human]] man with olive skin and short curly black hair. His hands had calluses typical of a musician who played a stringed [[musical instrument]].",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Flame Cullagh of [[Baldur's Gate]] was ordered to infiltrate the [[Moonrise Towers]] in order to investigate its ancestral [[Thorm]] family. Art was personally tasked with the investigation by Grand Duke Eltan. The Grand Duke had become aware of a corruption that had begun spreading through the towers and the town of [[Reithwin]] in addition to rumors of a [[Sharran]] enclave emerging in the area. Art was to rent a room at the [[Last Light Inn]] and work from there, starting with the investigation of the town's [[House of Healing]].\n\nHowever, Flame Cullagh was among those consumed by the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] when the town was enveloped by a Sharran [[curse]]. Unlike many others, Art survived, his mind addled. He was found wandering in the shadows in the {{YearlinkName|1492}} by the [[Harpers]] led by the High Harper [[Jaheira]] and the Flaming Fist under Councilor [[Florrick]]. His now catatonic yet still-living body was laid down in the Last Light Inn. Fist [[J'ehlar]] attended to the comatose man, who was unresponsive and only mumbled lyrics of an ancient song. His condition was a spiritual malaise; his mind was gripped by the [[Shadowfell]], but he remained human as the world of darkness failed to break Art's mind fully. Fist J'ehlar was trying to help the catatonic man in order to find out any information about Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]], who had been kidnapped and dragged into the Moonrise Towers.\n\nIt is unknown if Flame Cullagh was woken up, remained bed-ridden, or if he survived when the shadow curse finally consumed the Last Light Inn."
