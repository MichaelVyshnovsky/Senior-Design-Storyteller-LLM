        "mainbody": "Prince Natan of the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul was a paladin of Ilmater who became a saint of that faith for his heroic sacrifice.\nNatan was the third son of Prince Coram of Tethyr,\nIn the Year of the Keening Gale, 1050 DR, the paladin-prince was traveling with his family as part of a caravan when they were all attacked by three wereboars. Natan died saving his family, which included his newborn son Coram, and the strangers of the caravan. As his dying wish, he asked that a temple to Ilmater be built in his memory.\nWithin a few months, the Church of Ilmater made Prince Natan a saint, and they constructed a garrison and temple as he had requested. In addition, the site became an orphanage with a school and a monastery, being called the Monastery of St. Natan.\nSt. Natans body was buried in one of the corners of the courtyard of the monastery, and his spirit continued to watch over the worshipers of Ilmater there."
