'''Cellayne''' was a powerful [[necromancer]] affiliated with the [[Zhentarim]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
According to her twin brother [[Glawinn]], she was never a gentle person. She treated Glawinn and her family harshly and had a crooked nature. Later in life, she displayed extreme coldness and sadism. Cellayne didn't have any qualms about trying to kill her own brother and, when she failed at it, she raised his dead friends against him as punishment.

==History==
Cellayne was born in [[Daggerdale]] to a couple composed of a knight and a cheesemaker. She was Glawinn's twin sister, but their characters were nothing alike. She had a darker character and was hard on her family.

Since there had been many battles in the region with the Zhentarim, she believed that despite efforts, the Zhentarim would keep their grip on Daggerdale. She saw this as an opportunity to follow her dark nature and, when she was seventeen, she joined the Zhentarim. 

She saw her brother only twice after she left and, on the second occasion, Glawinn attacked her stronghold near [[Darkhold]] with two other companions. She not only almost killed him, she also killed his companions and raised them against him as punishment for attacking her. As far as it's known, she still served as one of the Zhentarim by the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
