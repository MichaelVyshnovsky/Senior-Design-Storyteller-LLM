Lady '''Jasmine''' was the head [[priest]]ess of [[Selûne]] and a priest of [[Sehanine Moonbow]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|2}}

==Description==
Lady Jasmine had snow-white hair and opalescent eyes.

==History==
Lady Jasmine witnessed the fall of the ''[[shards of Selûne]]'' on Neverwinter and recognized the event as a sign from Selûne. She later contacted and tasked a group of [[adventurer]]s to retrieve the gems. When the gems were brought back to her, Lady Jasmine used them to purify the [[Shard of Night]], reconsecrating the place to Selûne.

Lady Jasmine may have aided a group of adventurers to solve a series of mysterious murders in Neverwinter, when a [[plaguechanged]] [[aboleth]] of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] went insane and began to causing the citizens of Neverwinter to go mad and kill one another.{{Cite dungeon/195/That Which Never Sleeps|6}}
