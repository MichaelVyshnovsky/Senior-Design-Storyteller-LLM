For several years, the man was locked in a bitter rivalry with the Duke of Spandeliyon, Edwall Dest. Eventually, their antagonism reached its pinnacle in a shooting competition. The winner of the competition was to be declared the superior archer between the two. Dukes Raymond and Edwall both wielded powerful enchanted bows. But Raymonds weapon, later known as Dead Shot, was stolen by the Duke of Spandeliyon before the competition. Edwall entered the shooting match confident in his advantage, exulting in his inevitable victory. However, Duke Raymond planned a surprise of his own. He demanded his opponent demonstrate his proficiency in sharpshooting on a scarecrow that bore an eerie resemblance to Edwall Dest himself.
