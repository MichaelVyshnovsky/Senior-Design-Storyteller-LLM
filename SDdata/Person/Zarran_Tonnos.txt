High Moonmistress '''Zarran Tonnos''' was a [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] priest and the leader of [[Moonmaiden's Hall]] in [[Murann]] of [[Amn]] during the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|757}}, during her service at Moonmaiden's Hall, Zarran was informed of the charges laid against the [[New Moon Pact]] by High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in distant [[Chancelgaunt]]. Believing that the Pact had indeed fallen to the heresy of believing [[Shar]] and [[Selûne]] the same being, Zarran supported the charges and condoned the extermination of the Pact.
