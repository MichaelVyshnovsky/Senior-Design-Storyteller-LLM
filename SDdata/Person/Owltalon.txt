Owltalon was a Sharran Dark Justiciar Crusader in the hidden Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Owltalon was a high elven woman with a light skin tone and blue yes. He features were hidden by a Sharran Justiciars helmet and a set of highly-decorated Justiciar plate mail. She was armed with a greatsword.
Like other Sharran Justiciars, Owltalon was a formidable foe whose attackes were reinforced with necrotic magics. She could assume umbral form when enveloped in darkness and land devastating mental attacks, overwhelming her opponents with grief.
Owltalon shared a close relationship of some sort with a fellow Justiciar Nightmist, or "her little Nightmist," as the other woman referred to herself in their letter exchange. Nightmist eagerly reported to Owltalon that her mistress approved Nightmists status as a Certified Venom Specialist and allowed her to study sudden esophageal collapse.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Owltalon served the Mother Superior Viconia DeVir in the underground Cloister of Sombre Embrace as one of her cultists underneath the House of Grief. Owltalon, along with the entirety of the cloister may have confronted its rogue member named Shadowheart, were she to turn away from Shar. Owltalon could have perished in the struggle. By other accounts, Owltalon and the rest of the cloister helped defend the city of Baldurs Gate from the army of the Absolute, were Shadowheart to remain loyal to her evil deity, or if Shadowheart was betrayed and surrendered to the Mother Superior for punishment.
