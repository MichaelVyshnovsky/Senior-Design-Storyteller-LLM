Huntmaster '''Rusk''' was a cleric of [[Malar]].{{Cite dragon/289/Rogues Gallery: The Foes of Stormweather, Part 2|94-98}}

==Relationships==
Rusk once loved [[Maleva]].

==History==
Rusk was born as a natural [[werewolf]] in a community where people worshiped all nature gods: [[Silvanus]], [[Chauntea]], [[Malar]], and [[Eldath]]. For many years, he was welcomed among both humans and wolves, gaining a reputation as a ranger in the [[Dalelands]] and [[Sembia]].

He was in love with Maleva, a powerful cleric of [[Selûne]]. She told Rusk about the [[Black Wolf]] prophecy, a heresy shared by both worshipers of Selûne and worshipers of Malar.

Rusk later became a hunter of renown. He was hired by [[Vilsek Malveen]] of [[Selgaunt]] as a guide. Soon he gathered followers and started arguing with Maleva, who wanted him to convert to Selùne's faith. Breaking with Maleva Rusk, he instead joined the [[People of the Black Blood]].

In [[1372 DR]], [[Stannis Malveen]] contacted Rusk, offering a rare copy of the [[Black Wolf Scroll]] in exchange for infecting with [[lycanthropy]] a member of the [[Uskevren]] family.

==Personality==
Rusk feared he would no longer be the chosen vessel of Malar, and even that he might never have been. He feared he had himself created the individual that would become the new champion of Malar.
