        "mainbody": "Femter Deldrannus was a Sharran faithful during the midâ€“8 century DR.\nHe was a bald man with purple and black robes.\nHe looted a plethora of magic from Karsus Keep.\nFemter was one of Elryns Dreadspells.\nAs a Dreadspell, he wielded borrowed arcane power.\nFemter Deldrannus was one of the Dreadspells sent with Elryn to find and slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the . During the first leg of the trip, he had Uldus Blackram lead the way, while holding the noose around the mans throat. When Uldus Blackram was killed by Ilbryn Starym, Femter found this funny.\nOnce they found the ruin, Karsus Keep, Femter helped loot the place of magic, and in particular found a ring that cloaked against seekings and hid all dweomers. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.\nWhen Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, she used some agonizing power on Femter to convince the others before having him stand and walk. They were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder, two mages that appeared suddenly, and he made another attempt to escape, which was cut short by her control again. She then used him to absorb an attack from Starsunder, which left nothing but chunks of him."
