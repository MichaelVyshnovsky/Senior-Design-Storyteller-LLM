        "Personality": "Shortcloak was known for being excessively vocal. Despite the fact that he actually enjoyed his job, he never stopped complaining about it. He often complained to his fellow guards about being over-worked, but none of them took him seriously. Though he said he would buy out his work contract if he could, this was all just talk.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, [[Rilsa Rael]] of [[the Guild]] considered raiding the [[Seatower of Balduran]]. In order to do this, she needed to get a strike team close to the gate. Rael suspected that Lotgeir might have helped them, should the plot go ahead."
