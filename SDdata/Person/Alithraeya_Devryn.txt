Alithraeya Devryn was an aspiring adventurer inhabiting Yeshpek along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was beautiful and graceful, traits which often got the attention of visiting adventuring bands.
Tymoras grace seemed to follow Alithraeya on her adventures, as often the bands she travelled with would sometimes meet terrible ends while she survived without a scratch to return to Yeshpek and await the next company. She was even investigated by Harper agents to make sure she wasnt a monster masquerading as a women in order to lure adventurers to their deaths. All in all, Alithraeya was a member of over twenty different adventuring bands.
