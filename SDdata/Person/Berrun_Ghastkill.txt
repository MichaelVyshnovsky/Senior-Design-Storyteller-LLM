'''Berrun Ghastkill''' was the mayor of [[Nashkel]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Abilities==
Berrun was very skilled with the [[bow]] and [[spear]], and specialized in fighting [[ogre]]s.

==Relationships==
Berrun was the younger brother of Lord [[Evan Ghastkill]], head of the local [[Ghastkill]] family.

==History==
Berrun served as mayor of Nashkel and was an active [[adventurer]] in his time, and earned a great local reputation for saving many residents from a tribe of [[Cloud Peaks]] [[goblin]]s.

In the year [[1368 DR]] during the [[iron crisis]], Berrun called on the [[Harpers]] for aid, ultimately leading to his past acquaintance [[Jaheira]] and her husband [[Khalid]] being dispatched. He later met the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]], and directed the young hero onwards to the [[Nashkel mines]], the source of the issue.
