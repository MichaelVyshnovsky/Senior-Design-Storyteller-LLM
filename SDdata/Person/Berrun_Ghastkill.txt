Berrun Ghastkill was the mayor of Nashkel around 1370 DR.
Berrun was very skilled with the bow and spear, and specialized in fighting ogres.
Berrun was the younger brother of Lord Evan Ghastkill, head of the local Ghastkill family.
Berrun served as mayor of Nashkel and was an active adventurer in his time, and earned a great local reputation for saving many residents from a tribe of Cloud Peaks goblins.
In the year 1368 DR during the iron crisis, Berrun called on the Harpers for aid, ultimately leading to his past acquaintance Jaheira and her husband Khalid being dispatched. He later met the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian, and directed the young hero onwards to the Nashkel mines, the source of the issue.
