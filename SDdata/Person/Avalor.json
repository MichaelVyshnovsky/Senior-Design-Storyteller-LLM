        "Relationships": "The sagacious elf had one known child, a daughter named [[Liel]],\n\nAvalor served as a member of Queen [[Anais Rhindaun|Anais]]' privy council. This appointment was seen as detestable by those in Tethyr that maintained a distinct and vicious hatred for the elven people.",
        "History": "While it was not known for sure, some suspected that Avalor was responsible for the [[Children's Massacre]] of Tethyr in the {{YearlinkName|1469}}. One [[Amhar|survivor of the attack]], who managed to remained anonymous saw that the killers had the pointed ears of elves.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Avalor heard about a supernatural attack in [[Cardewton]], the colony in [[Chult]] in which Liel was staying. Avalor was convinced she was murdered by her husband [[Declan Cardew]]. Avalor hired Harp and his crew to uncover her whereabouts in [[Chult]], or in the worst case scenario, bring back her remains."
