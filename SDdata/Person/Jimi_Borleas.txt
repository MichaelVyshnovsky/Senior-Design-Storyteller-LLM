Fist Jimi Borleas was a member of the Flaming Fist mercenary company from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Jimi was a gold dwarvish man with a light skin tone, blue eyes, and a clean-shaven face. He wore a set of chainmail armor as part of the Flaming Fist uniform, decorated with the organizations emblem on a tabard. He was armed with a halberd and was ready to use it to punctuate his stern and cruel attitude.
In the , Fist Borleas answered a complaint from Battrick Degronce in the Lower City. The gnome complained about the stench of decay around Philgraves Mansion. Fist Borleas tried to convince Battrick that the stench was nothing but a clogged sewer and that he would file a report requesting the sewers eventual cleanup. However, Battrick was correct in his suspicions that the stench was coming from the mansion. It was the lair of Mystic Carrion and his undead servants.
