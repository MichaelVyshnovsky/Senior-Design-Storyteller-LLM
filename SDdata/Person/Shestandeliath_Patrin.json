        "mainbody": "'''Shestandeliath Patrin''', was a [[dragonborn]] [[paladin]] of [[Bahamut]] member of [[Clan Shestandeliath]], and the leader of the [[Platinum Cadre]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "Description": "Patrin was a big dragonborn with scarlet scales, and scars were he once wore his clan's piercings. Three silver chains pierced into his lower jaw simulated a beard.",
        "Abilities": "Patrin was able to breathe fire. As Patrin was a true follower of Bahamut, Nala's tiamatan enhancing magic didn't have any effects on him.",
        "Relationships": "He was the lover of [[Nala]]. Unknown to Patrin, Nala was actually a priestess of [[Tiamat]].",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, Patrin led the Platinum Cadre to the [[Black Ash Plain]] in order to kill as many [[Stone giant|ash giants]] as they could. They helped [[Daardendrien Medrash]], [[Daardendrien Balasar]] and [[Khouryn Skulldark]] after those three had to flee from the giants. Feeling in Medrash a kindred spirit, and due to the connection of their gods, Bahamut and [[Torm]], Patrin wanted to befriend him and to show him the Platinum Cadre was actually a force of good, but Medrash didn't wanted to believe in his words. \n\nThe Platinum Cadre was part of [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]]'s joint military operation against the giants. Although Nala didn't want them to attack at the same time the other thymari military forces did, Balasar was able to convince his \"brothers-in-arms\" to join into the fray. Balasar, Medrash, Nala and Patrin fought toe to toe in order to save Tarhun's life.\n\nPatrin was killed by Medrash in a duel of honor after Patrin refused to turn against Nala when she was exposed as a tiamatan, and wanted him and the others to surrender any evidence they had. Before he died, after having realized that Nala was indeed a follower of Tiamat, he stopped the other members of the Cadre who wanted to take revenge against Medrash, who at last acknowledged him as an honorable comrade and friend."
