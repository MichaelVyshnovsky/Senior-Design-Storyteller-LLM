Zan Zoldaftel was a renowned wagon maker who lived in Crimmor during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Old Zan was the reason Crimmor was synonymous with top-of-the-line carts and wagons everywhere. He was known throughout Amn and beyond as the best wagon maker that ever was. His popularity was such that he had to place a magical dweomer on his logo (representing his initials) to prevent counterfeits. That mark was cast by his daughter and business manager Rhieldra, a talented sorcerer.
Zans shop, Zoldaftel Wagons, was located in the western part of the River Ward.

Zan was well-liked, respected by his peers, and on friendly terms with his competitors. Over the years he took on many apprentices, on the condition that their own business would stay in Crimmor as well. As a result the city became renowned for its wagons, and Zan became the figurehead of the Wagonmakers Guild&mdashhis former apprentices forming the bulk of the guild.
Zan was a widow, and lived with his unmarried daughter.
