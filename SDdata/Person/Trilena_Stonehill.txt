Trilena Stonehill was the co-owner of the Stonehill Inn in Phandalin during the late 15 century DR. She assisted her husband, Toblen Stonehill, in running the inn. She served as one of the founding members of the Town Council of Phandalin.
She was married to Toblen. They had a son named Pip 
Trilena was an active member of the Phandalin community, and was trusted by her neighbors to look out for their welfare. 
Trilena and Toblen were originally from Triboar. They moved to Phandalin following the birth of their son in the 1480s DR.
In 1491 DR, Trilena became worried about Phandalins local bandits, known as the Redbrands. The group had recently killed Thel Dendrar, the only one to stand up to the wicked band. The Redbrands had then taken his wife and children to their hideout. Trilena and her family stayed out of this business, as they didnt want any harm to come to themselves.
Not long after the end of the Redbrand incident, Teilena and her daughter witnessed a trio of goblins cause the Shrine of Luck to collapse. They both assisted Sister Garaele with the cleanup. 
When her son, Pip, went missing a short time later, Trilena sought out adventurers to go and find him.
Following Phandalins decision to elect a Town Council sometime after the Redbrand incident, Trilena was elected to the role alongside Sildar Hallwinter and the former Townmaster, Harbin Wester. She was seen as the representative of her fellow "longtime" residents, who elected her to make sure the council looked after their interests. She was quick to seek out and hire adventurers whenever someone in town disappeared.
By 1496 DR, she was no longer a member of the town council and her family found themselves in the middle of a struggle for political power when Harbin Wester, in his capacity as the towns banker, began attempting to take over the Stonehill Inn.
