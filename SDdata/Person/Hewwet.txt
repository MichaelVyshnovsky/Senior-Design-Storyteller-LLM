Corporal '''Hewwet''' was a [[human]] [[fighter]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Hewwet was much more patient and calm in comparison with his instructor colleagues.

==Relationships==
Hewwet was among the instructors who taught the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] at the [[Neverwinter Academy]].

Hewwet believed that [[Herban]]'s decision to demote the previous instructor after he was caught socializing on duty was strict but just.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Hewwet was a corporal of the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. He worked as an instructor specializing in ranged and missile weapon combat and assisted instructors Herban and [[Dendy]]. He usually sparred with the students of the Academy and conducted combat trials.

Dendy wanted to take a look at [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] at the graduation ceremonies after his shift, but his life was ended in the attack on the Academy.
