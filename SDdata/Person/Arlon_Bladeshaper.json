However, he also suffered from stress and was frowning all the time. He was described as taciturn and serious.\nArlon was considered a handsome man.\nArlon was a warrior of considerable skill.\nArlon was the leader of the aggressive faction of the Sons of Alagondar insurgent movement, the Nashers. Although he resorted to violence, he did so because he genuinely believed it was the only way to depose the tyrannical rule of Dagult Neverember, as Arlon had Neverwinters best interests as a priority.\nHe was aided in his endeavors by his lieutenant Karzov.\nAfter the death of Cymril in the , Arlon took the leadership of a few Sons of Alagondar and founded the Nashers faction. Although at first he was leery of embracing an aggressive stance against Lord Neverember, he was convinced by Valindra Shadowmantle to abandon Cymrils methods and embrace a darker path. It was Arlon who took the decision to ally the Nashers with the Thayans and the Dead Rats of Neverwinter, although reluctantly.\nA few months later, Arlon supported at first the self-proclaimed \"Lost Heir\" of the Alagondar line. However, when the \"Lost Heir\" began to incite a civil war among the citizens, Arlon joined forces with a group of adventurers hired by Lord Neverember to stop the \"Lost Heir\", as he believed that a civil war was not the best for Neverwinter."
