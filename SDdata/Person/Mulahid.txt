Mulahid was an efreeti of Zakharan folklore.
Mulahid fell in love with the Grandmother of the Everlastingâ€”a woman said to be so fierce that even lions would get out of her way. Unable to snare her heart by conventional means, Mulahid threatened to kill the Grandmothers followers if she did not submit to his cravings. The Grandmother agreed to spend the night with Mulahid if he released her followers and promised not to harm them. The two met in a remote cave beneath the World Pillar Mountains. The beguiling Grandmother turned Mulahids lust against him, binding the efreeti with chains of affection. Mulahid promised to serve the Grandmother by ensuring the faithfulness of her followers.
This historical event marked the creation of the first oathbinder genie.
