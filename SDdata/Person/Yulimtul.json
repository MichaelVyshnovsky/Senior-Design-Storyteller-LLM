        "mainbody": "Yulimtul was an officer of the Flaming Fist mercenary company during the mid–14 century DR.\nIn 1364 DR, Yulimtul, along with Scar, Bellan, Desedrak, and over 500 Fist members sailed out from Faerûn on an expedition in search of the legendary land of Anchorome. While they were beset by disease and storms, they safely landed in the port city of Helmsport in Maztica. \nWhile in the safety of the Amnian colony, the group split, with Yulimtul, Desedrak, and over 200 Fist mercenaries traveling overland across the continent to the northwest, in search of the legendary Maztican City of Gold. However, the explorers completely disappeared and were never heard from again."
