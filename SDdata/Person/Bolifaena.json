Matron Arolina ordered DuQuelve to secretly transport the two priestesses to her. However, a mission headed by Beniago and Zaknafein DoUrden was following them. Iccara promised to DuQuelve a load of arandur and the service of a deep gnome slave, Symvyn Rivenstone. However, Iccara and Bolfea had their own mysterious plans in mind. Iccara and Bolfea knew the plans of all the players and planned to play all the factions against each other.\nSome time later, DuQuelve went with Iccara to the meeting with the deep gnome and forced him to dispel the wards of the gnomes outpost. However, Zaknafein, Jarlaxle, and Kimmuriel Oblodra suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara and Bolfea were revealed to be yochlols. Kimmuriel identified Bolfea as the handmaiden Bolifaena and forced her to retreat to the Abyss. In the end, Zaknafein destroyed Iccara, injured DuQuelve, and freed Symvyn.\nIn later years, DuQuelves career stagnated despite her claim of having been in league with two yochlols, as all knew she had only been tricked by the handmaidens.\nMeanwhile, Matron Yvonnel Baenre summoned Bolifaena and the handmaiden made a complete report of the matter to her."
