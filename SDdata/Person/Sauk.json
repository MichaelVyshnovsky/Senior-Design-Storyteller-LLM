        "mainbody": "'''Sauk''' was a [[Malarite]] hunter,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||5}} and one of the [[Blades of the Old Man]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||3}} He was a part of the team that went to look for [[Kheil]] and secure the ''[[Erael'len]]'' in the Northern [[Shalhoond]], conspiring to kill the [[Chereth|Old Man of the Mountain]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||4}}",
        "Appearance": "Sauk was a full head taller than [[Berun]], and well muscled.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||14}}{{cite book/Sentinelspire||41}}",
        "Personality": "Sauk was violent and cunning, but loyal to a fault, tolerating otherwise impossible annoyances and resistance from Kheil.",
        "History": "When Sauk was fifteen, he killed his father's son. He joined the [[Blades of the Old Man]] at some point between then and {{yearlink|1365}}, when he was a part of the raid on the [[Yuirwood]] where Kheil was captured; he considered that the blackest of his life.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||7}} \n\nAfter Talieth discovered [[Kheil]] was alive, Sauk had sent Taaki to lure him out of the steppes, looking for his aid in slaying the [[Old Man of the Mountain]]. After finding him and learning he went by Berun, he told him that [[Chereth]] was still alive, that the Old Man of the Mountain drained his druidic powers for his own use in between tortures. Though Berun offered to bring a force of servants of [[Silvanus]], Sauk refused to allow that many outsiders to enter the hidden fortress. To get Berun to go with him, he attempted to threaten [[Lewan]], his apprentice. After Berun's escape attempt ended in him being swallowed by a [[shambling mound]], he took [[Lewan]] back to [[Sentinelspire]] anyway, expecting him to maybe be of some use.\n\nDuring a conversation with Talieth, he realized Berun might not have died.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||20}} Later, when Lewan requested to be allowed to purify himself in the wild, it was Sauk that accompanied him; the half-orc offered the young man the chance to flee, if he so desired.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||22}} He witnessed the exchange between Lewan and the Old Man of the Mountain,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||23}} then questioned the pupil about it, finally relating this to Talieth.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||24}}\n\nOn the night of [[Tarsakh 25]], he fought several blades loyal to the Old Man,{{cite book/Sentinelspire||30}} at least one [[killoren]],{{cite book/Sentinelspire||39}} and was instrumental in defeating the Old Man himself.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||40}}",
        "Relationships": "Sauk considered [[Kheil]] to be closer than a brother, and even cut one ''[[luzal unba]]'' for him when he thought him dead. He considered only Talieth to be more powerful than he was. His ''arumwon'', or animal companion, was a [[tiger]] named [[Taaki]]."
