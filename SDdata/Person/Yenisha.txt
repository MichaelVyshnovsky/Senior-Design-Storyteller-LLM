==History==
Yenisha was always a troublemaker, having become disenchanted with her people. So she decided to travel to see the [[Metahel]], the [[Dog People]], the [[Short Ones]], and the [[Poscadari Elves]].

In [[1362 DR]], Yenisha observed from afar [[Sozarro]]'s expedition and decided that they were the right people to save her people. In exchange, she promised to guide them to [[Michaca]].

==Personality==
Yenisha was a very active person. She quickly became disenchanted with her people and from her meeting with other peoples, Yenisha came to feel that her people were stagnant.
