He lamented that many Dalesmen would not be returning home and that people would forget this pain, and battles would ultimately happen again.\n\nSome of his memories lived on, given by [[Mystra]] to [[Elminster Aumar]]. However, evil would eventually cost even him those memories, as the [[archdevil]] [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]] would forcibly wrest them from Elminster while he was captive in [[Avernus]], on {{yearlink|1372}}."
