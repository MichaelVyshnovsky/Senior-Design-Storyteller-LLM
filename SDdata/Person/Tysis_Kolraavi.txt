Tysis Kolraavi was the shaman of the Black Lion Uthgardt tribe during the late 15 century DR.
Tysis did not believe in acting diplomatically. She refused to suffer the influence of the "civilized" people.
Tysis was the younger sister of the tribes Great Chief, Stellok Kolraavi. She served as the only confidant her brother could truly rely upon.
