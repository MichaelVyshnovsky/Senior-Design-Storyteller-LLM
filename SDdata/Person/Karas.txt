|Bravo. You've saved me the trouble of double-crossing and killing Gnomon later. But I rather wished he succeeded in killing you first. So be it, sometimes one must dirty his own hands.

==Description==
Karas had gray skin and white hair. He wore a [[chain shirt]] and wielded a pair of [[poison|envenomed]] [[scimitar]]s.

==History==
During the [[Darkening]] of [[Faer√ªn]],{{DDO-time}} Karas served as a leader in the [[Lords of Dust]] cult dedicated to the [[demon]]ic being known as the Spinner of Shadows. As part of a plot to free their patron, Karas and the [[rakshasa]] [[Gnomon]] prepared a ritual in their [[w:c:Eberron:Stormreach|Stormreach]] [[Cult safehouse (Stormreach)|hideout]] to gain access to the hidden [[Spinner's Prison]] in [[w:c:Eberron:Khyber (Underdark)|Khyber]]. When the [[w:c:Eberron:Church of the Silver Flame|Church of the Silver Flame]] discovered them and attacked their hideout, Karas allowed Gnomon to die first before engaging in battle himself. When he too fell, his sacrifice finished the ritual and the path to the Spinner's Prison was opened for his allies.
