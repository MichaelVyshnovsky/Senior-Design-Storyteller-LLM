'''Thokk''' was a [[half-orc]]ish slave captured by Chieftain [[Saslick]]'s [[lizardfolk]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Thokk was an unusually large half-orc with grayish skin. He was content with wearing filthy rags. He enjoyed violence and grinned savagely when allowed to rip an opponent apart by his lizard slavers.

==History==
Thokk was captured by Saslick's lizard tribe sometime in or before 1372 DR. Unlike other slaves, the half-orc enjoyed being unleashed on a small makeshift gladiatorial arena, armed with a simple club. Observers often compared his attitude and grinning to that of a hungry [[wild dog]]. In 1372 DR, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe wearing a magical disguise. The adventurer witnessed a cruel and unfair gladiatorial battle between giant orc-of-a-man Thokk and a petite [[elf]] woman [[Lenaia]]. Thokk's fate remained unknown, whether he was slain in the ring, released along with other slaves by the Hero of Daggerford, or left in the scaly hands of his capturers.
