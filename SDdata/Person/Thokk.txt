Thokk was a half-orcish slave captured by Chieftain Saslicks lizardfolk in 1372 DR.
Thokk was an unusually large half-orc with grayish skin. He was content with wearing filthy rags. He enjoyed violence and grinned savagely when allowed to rip an opponent apart by his lizard slavers.
Thokk was captured by Saslicks lizard tribe sometime in or before 1372 DR. Unlike other slaves, the half-orc enjoyed being unleashed on a small makeshift gladiatorial arena, armed with a simple club. Observers often compared his attitude and grinning to that of a hungry wild dog. In 1372 DR, the Hero of Daggerford infiltrated the lizardfolk tribe wearing a magical disguise. The adventurer witnessed a cruel and unfair gladiatorial battle between giant orc-of-a-man Thokk and a petite elf woman Lenaia. Thokks fate remained unknown, whether he was slain in the ring, released along with other slaves by the Hero of Daggerford, or left in the scaly hands of his capturers.
