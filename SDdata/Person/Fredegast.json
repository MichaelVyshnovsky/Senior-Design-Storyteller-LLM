After learning from [[Garlen]] and [[Garvin]] that the party had come to aid [[Bloodstone Village]], Fredegast wished them luck but was unwilling to commit his own militia to their cause at that time. and his archers aided the forces of Bloodstone in the [[Bloodstone Wars]].\n\nAs of [[1359 DR]], he was still sheriff but was primarily responsible for the operations and upkeep of the [[Warren]], a massive underground fortress constructed by the Alliance of Belt Watchers."
