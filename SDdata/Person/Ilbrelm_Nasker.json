        "mainbody": "Ilbrelm Nasker was a shoemaker of Alaghôn in Turmish in the late 14 century DR.\nIlbrelm was stolid and patient, and a hard worker.\nIlbrelms business made shoes, sandals, slippers, and clogs of all sizes in mundane designs. They were produced in great quantities for low prices, but they rarely lasted longer than a season. They were commonly worn by poor folk across Faerûn who lacked the coin for better, longer-lasting footware.\nSimilarly, Ilbrelm hired the poor, orphans, outcasts, and disabled and deformed people in need from around Turmish. While the work was hard, he provided shelter, warmth, food, and the support of a big family of fellow employees.\nHis company was a supplier of the Sembian trader Melvos Hammerstars."
