Clariburnus Tanthul was a shade sorcerer and shadow adept and one of the twelve princes of the city of Thultanthar in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
He was a massive individual, roughly the size of a bugbear.
Never showing emotion in his flat, whispering voice or unlined skin, Clariburnus could don a façade of charm to mask his dead soul. Despite this, Clariburnus had retained more humanity than any of the other twelve princes of Shade.
Clariburnus often wielded a magical +3 glaive of wounding, that appeared to be formed from some type of black glass rather than metal.
He was a skilled warrior and tactical commander. 
Circa 1372 DR, Clariburnus had no known views on how the Shadovar should seize control of the Heartlands, but only because no-one had yet asked him.
By the late 1400s DR, Dethud was general of the armies of the revived empire of Netheril.
Free of the Shadowfell, Clariburnus longed to see the expansion of Netheril. One of his main goals was always to restore power to the First Enclave, Xinlenal. He was placed in charge of Shadovar operations in Neverwinter, where Clariburnus led the Netherese in the restoration of Xinlenal to Toril, along with the first new mythallar formed in ages.
His father was High Prince Telamont Tanthul, and he had eleven brothers, the princes of Shade Aglarel, Brennus, Dethud, Escanor, Lamorak, Malath, Mattick, Melegaunt, Rivalen,Vattick, and Yder. He was the second-youngest of the twelve Princes of Shade, and the youngest to survive his peoples return to Faerûn.
One of the twelve Princes of Shade, Clariburnus held power in Netheril since before the fall of the First Empire. He soon gained famed as the youngest captain in the military of Thultanthar. Although rumors said this was due to him being one of the Princes of Shade, Clariburnus was recognized by those closest to him for his military prowess. 
In the , Clariburnus and his brothers returned to the Realms on the eve of the Return. His first destination, along with Escanor and Aglarel, was the Marsh of Chelimber, where the trio slew a group of phaerimm. There they encountered Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep, and after some verbal fumbling, make poor work of their first act of diplomacy back in the Realms. 
Clariburnus enjoyed success however, when he and Brennus enlisted the aid of the witch Ruha, traveled to the lair of the blue dracolich Malygris, and killed its Dragon Cultist oppressor. The pair forged a new alliance that proved quite valuable during the emerging conflict between the Princes and the rest of the Realms.
The second-youngest prince then joined with Lamorak and made a second appeal to Laeral Silverhand, newly appointed commander of the Army of the North. The pair offered to help them destroy the phaerimm in the Shaeradim surrounding the elven city of Evereska. Clariburnus and Lamorak led the Shadovar alongside Laeral and her army through the shadowshell and the Deadwall surrounding the Shaeradim, and hunted down every phaerimm they encountered in the Vine Vale. Their victory was short-lived, however, as Clariburnus and his brother abandoned the Army of the North and allowed the phaerimm army to descend upon them when it was most convenient.
In the late 1400s DR, Clariburnus, since taking over, commenced a search for Ioulaum, believing the mage to be alive. Upon arriving in the North, Prince Clariburnus would almost immediately strike an alliance with the Gray Wolf Tribe.
Upon finding the ruined enclave of Xinlenal, Clairburnus immediately set upon repairing it. By 1479 DR, he had put hundreds of shades, humans, shadar-kai, undead and constructs at work to uncover and repair the enclave. Knowing the mythallar would put Netheril at an advantage against Thay, Clariburnus sought magical relics and items to create residuum in order to feed the enclaves mythallar. The prince placed the Sharran priest Orthinos Eln in charge of overseeing the excavation.
Although Clariburnus sought items from ruins, he often resorted to attacking Thay for them as well. The prince soon became aware that he would eventually have to extend into New Neverwinter to complete his search, as the legion of items hed already amassed were enough. Clariburnus often attacked Valindra Shadowmantle and her Thayan forces using the Gray Wolf warriors as the front line. He wished to close the Shadowfell portal inside the Dread Ring all the while keeping the Thayans reeling. In order to do this, he directed the enclave of Kolthunral to invade the Thayan city of Surcross to end Thayan presence in Shadowfell.
His personal sigil was a golden star with a black outline on a field of midnight blue.
