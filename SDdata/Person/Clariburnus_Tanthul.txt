'''Clariburnus Tanthul''' was a [[shade]] [[sorcerer]] and [[shadow adept]] and one of [[Princes of Shade|the twelve princes]] of the city of [[Thultanthar]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].
{{quote|''Netheril ruled for thousands of years. Wrapped tight in a second womb of shadow, we have learned from our past mistakes for over a thousand more. How foolish for any mortal to even imagine standing against us now.''|Clariburnus Tanthul}}

==Description==
He was a massive individual, roughly the size of a [[bugbear]].

==Personality==
Never showing emotion in his flat, whispering voice or unlined skin, Clariburnus could don a façade of charm to mask his dead soul. Despite this, Clariburnus had retained more humanity than any of the other twelve princes of Shade.

==Possessions==
Clariburnus often wielded a [[magic]]al ''+3 [[glaive]] of [[wounding]]'', that appeared to be formed from some type of black glass rather than metal.

==Abilities==
He was a skilled warrior and tactical commander. 

==Activities==
''Circa'' 1372 DR, Clariburnus had no known views on how the Shadovar should seize control of the [[Heartlands]], but only because no-one had yet asked him.

By the late 1400s DR, Dethud was general of the armies of the revived empire of [[Netheril]].

Free of the [[Shadowfell]], Clariburnus longed to see the expansion of Netheril. One of his main goals was always to restore power to the First Enclave, [[Xinlenal]]. He was placed in charge of [[Shadovar]] operations in [[Neverwinter]], where Clariburnus led the [[Netherese]] in the restoration of Xinlenal to [[Toril]], along with the first new ''[[mythallar]]'' formed in ages.

==Relationships==
His father was High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]], and he had eleven brothers, the princes of Shade: [[Aglarel Tanthul|Aglarel]], [[Brennus Tanthul|Brennus]], [[Dethud Tanthul|Dethud]], [[Escanor Tanthul|Escanor]], [[Lamorak Tanthul|Lamorak]], [[Malath Tanthul|Malath]], [[Mattick Tanthul|Mattick]], [[Melegaunt Tanthul|Melegaunt]], [[Rivalen Tanthul|Rivalen]],[[Vattick Tanthul|Vattick]], and [[Yder Tanthul|Yder]]. He was the second-youngest of the twelve Princes of Shade, and the youngest to survive his [[the Return|peoples' return]] to [[Faerûn]].

==History==
===Early Life===
One of the twelve Princes of Shade, Clariburnus held power in Netheril since before the fall of the First Empire. He soon gained famed as the youngest captain in the military of Thultanthar. Although rumors said this was due to him being one of the Princes of Shade, Clariburnus was recognized by those closest to him for his military prowess. 

===Return of the Archwizards===
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Clariburnus and his brothers returned to the Realms on the eve of [[the Return]]. His first destination, along with [[Escanor Tanthul|Escanor]] and [[Aglarel Tanthul|Aglarel]], was the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], where the trio slew a group of [[phaerimm]]. There they encountered Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] of Waterdeep, and after some verbal fumbling, make poor work of their first act of diplomacy back in the Realms. 

Clariburnus enjoyed success however, when he and [[Brennus Tanthul|Brennus]] enlisted the aid of the witch [[Ruha]], traveled to the lair of the [[Blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] [[Malygris]], and killed its [[Cult of the Dragon|Dragon Cultist]] oppressor. The pair forged a new alliance that proved quite valuable during the emerging conflict between the Princes and the rest of the Realms.

The second-youngest prince then joined with [[Lamorak Tanthul|Lamorak]] and made a second appeal to Laeral Silverhand, newly appointed commander of the [[Army of the North]]. The pair offered to help them destroy the [[phaerimm]] in the [[Shaeradim]] surrounding the [[elven]] city of [[Evereska]]. Clariburnus and Lamorak led the Shadovar alongside Laeral and her army through the [[shadowshell]] and the [[Deadwall]] surrounding the Shaeradim, and hunted down every phaerimm they encountered in the [[Vine Vale]]. Their victory was short-lived, however, as Clariburnus and his brother abandoned the Army of the North and allowed the phaerimm army to descend upon them when it was most convenient.

===Time in The North===
{{quote|What care have we for the feuding rabble that grubs about these lands? When fallen Xinlenal regains its rightful place in the skies, all the fractured factions of the North will be nothing more than cowering dogs in our shadow.|Clariburnus Tanthul}}
In the late 1400s DR, Clariburnus, since taking over, commenced a search for [[Ioulaum]], believing the mage to be alive. Upon arriving in the [[North]], Prince Clariburnus would almost immediately strike an alliance with the [[Gray Wolf Tribe]].

Upon finding the ruined enclave of [[Xinlenal]], Clairburnus immediately set upon repairing it. By [[1479 DR]], he had put hundreds of [[shade]]s, [[human]]s, [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]], [[undead]] and [[construct]]s at work to uncover and repair the enclave. Knowing the mythallar would put Netheril at an advantage against Thay, Clariburnus sought magical relics and items to create [[residuum]] in order to feed the enclave's [[mythallar]]. The prince placed the [[Shar]]ran priest [[Orthinos Eln]] in charge of overseeing the excavation.

Although Clariburnus sought items from ruins, he often resorted to attacking Thay for them as well. The prince soon became aware that he would eventually have to extend into New Neverwinter to complete his search, as the legion of items he'd already amassed were enough. Clariburnus often attacked [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and her Thayan forces using the Gray Wolf warriors as the front line. He wished to close the [[Shadowfell]] [[portal]] inside the [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] all the while keeping the Thayans reeling. In order to do this, he directed the enclave of [[Kolthunral]] to invade the Thayan city of [[Surcross]] to end Thayan presence in Shadowfell.

==Symbol==
His personal sigil was a golden star with a black outline on a field of midnight blue.
