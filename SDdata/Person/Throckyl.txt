'''Jandur''' was a [[War Wizard]] of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point after spring started in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, the [[Red Wizard]] [[Harnrim Starangh]] assaulted the armory of the sanctum where [[Vangerdahast]] dwelt after his retirement as [[Royal Mage]] of [[Cormyr]]. In doing so, he slew three mages: one with a [[slaying-snake]] spell, another by twisting his shielding magic against himself into a paralyzing field, and a third with [[staeradder]] poison. He fled after using a spell that burned out all recollections from their minds, preventing their dead bodies from responding to any questioning.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|259-262|16}}

[[Darthym]] reported Jandur as dead to the [[War Wizard]] [[Huldyl Rauthur]], a fellow War Wizard working in the sanctum.

In particular, Darthym noted that Throckyl had been blown apart, and his head was separated from the rest of his body. As the man bitten by a snake was not decapitated by any spells, Throckyl must've been one of the two guardians of the inner sanctum, strongly implying that Harnrim Starangh's spell to burn away memories could also cause bodily destruction in some cases.
