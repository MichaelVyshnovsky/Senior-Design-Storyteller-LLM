        "mainbody": "'''Hachaam Selorn''' was the Arm-Captain of the [[Akh'Velahr]] of [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Weeping War]].",
        "History": "Hachaam was born in the {{YearlinkName|420}}.\n\nSometime before the start of the Weeping War, the [[paladin]] [[Eadred]] and his commander Hachaam Selorn visited one of the ancient tombs in [[Glim-Gardens]], the Cold Knight's Barrow, which was home to a powerful [[wight]]. Together the duo managed to slay the undead, but Hachaam was trapped in frozen stasis by the wight's final spell, appearing cold and eternally asleep. When the danger of the looming war became apparent, Eadred returned to the ancient barrow seeking the way to free the commander whose leadership was indispensable. He managed to take Hachaam's place in eternal slumber, freeing the Arm-Captain just in time for him to lead Myth Drannoor's forces against the invaders.\n\nIn [[Ches]]–[[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|712}}, in a decisive battle that secured victory for Myth Drannor, Hachaam led the Cormanthor troops in reclaiming the ruins of the [[Elven Court]]. In [[Kythorn 1]]–[[Kythorn 14|14]], he led the Akh'Velahr in [[Darkwood]] to gain control of the region, with the objective of retreating there in the event of the fall of the city.\n\nDuring the final fall of the city in the {{YearlinkName|714}}, Hachaam, together with [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]], organized the final fight against the occupying [[Army of Darkness]] troops.\n\nAt last, in [[Kythorn]], the [[fiend]]ish troops led by [[Aulmpiter]] took control of the [[Crownfrost Tower]]. Using a [[Blood War]] tactic, the [[yugoloth]] managed to entrap and kill Hachaam and Arm-Major [[Kelvhan Olortynnal]].\n\nHachaam was laid to rest in the tomb located in the top level of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]], the Halls of Light, before the Dungeons were sealed with the ''word of power'' by the survivors of the war who fled the fallen city shortly after.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Hachaam was one of many [[ghost]]s that haunted the ruins of Myth Drannor. He appeared in front of the heroes fighting to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s corruption of the city's ''[[mythal]]''. The restless ghost implored the adventurers to recover a powerful enchanted blade he wielded in life, ''[[Faervian]]'', from the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] who were desecrating ancient tombs in search of powerful artifacts. When the adventurers retrieved the blade, Hachaam gifted them the recovered blade and aided them in recovering a more powerful sister-sword, ''[[Morvian]]'', from a long-imprisoned [[demon]] [[Rivener]].",
        "Relationship": "[[Paladin]] [[Eadred]] was one of Hachaam's subordinates who respected the Arm-Captain enough to sacrifice his life for his commander.\n\nHachaam alone continued to support the [[N'Vaelahr]] after they had rescued him in the early period of the war.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "*There was a famous [[bard]] ballad about Hachaam Selorn's stand against [[gnoll]]s, [[flind]]s, and [[ogre-kin]] on a small bridge in Myth Drannor, not far from [[Omberdawn Villa]]. The ballad told of the heroic battle in which Selorn and a few fellow heroes stopped the advancing forces of the Army oof Darkness with a pile of burning  bodies."
