'''Varden''' was a male [[human]] thief living in [[Scardale]] during the [[Time of Troubles]].

==History==
Varden was a successful thief in [[Scardale Town]] until in [[1358]] the god [[Bane]], after the [[Battle of Shadowdale]], ordered the [[Zhentilar]] armies to conquer Scardale in order to then threaten [[Tantras]].

Varden was conscripted into the [[Sembian Resistance]], composed of all forces in the dale fighting the [[Zhent]] forces. During a mission, they met the heroes [[Midnight]] and [[Adon]]. Understanding the importance of their mission, Varden helped them in many ways until they reunited with [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] and boarded a warship to Tantras to fulfill their mission. Varden went with them but when attacked by Bane's assassins on the sea, Varden was killed.{{cite book/Tantras|143-223}}
