Temenu was among the younger and less experienced heroes of the Living Jungle who answered the call, along with Green Spirit of the Koshiva, caiman katanga Roq Silent Hunter, tamhi Allanna, and butu Tanu. Temenu Farseers group was sent to enter the spider katanga caverns and faced hunting spider katangas who guarded a band of captured adventurers.\nIt was unknown if Temenu survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the Village of the Wise Ones for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and natures healing."
