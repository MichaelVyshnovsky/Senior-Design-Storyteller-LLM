Mirkon was a young tiefling boy from Elturel, who was exiled from the city along with all others of his kind in the late 15 century DR.
He had light red skin and two brown horns that turned down and outwards.
Mirkon was friends with Mol, a young girl who rallied many tiefling children into a lesser criminal organization.
In the , Elturel was pulled down into the Nine Hells in an event that came to be known as the Descent. Afterwards, all the tieflings in the city were exiled from their home and forced to live as refugees in the wilderness. Fortunately, they found temporary safe haven at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave.
At some point, Mirkon was wandered outside the enclave and became entranced by a song he heard. The singing unfortunately came from a group of harpies who were attempting to lure him away to his doom.
