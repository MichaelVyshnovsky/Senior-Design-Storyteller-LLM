'''Young Ned of Lonelywood''' was a fisher who made his name as the owner of ''[[Lucky Knucky]]'' in the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ned was a [[human]] man with light skin and gray hair. He spoke with a pirate's drawl and thought himself to be the sharpest sailor in the area.

==Relationships==
Young Ned was said to had been the best fisher on [[Maer Dualdon]] since his old [[Uncle Jed]].

==History==
The first owner of the well-known lucky charm from Targos was Young Ned, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|1292}}. Young Ned often fished with his buddy, [[Thom Farold]], who built a large boat he named ''[[Selara]]'' after his late wife. One day, Ned found his boat capsized in the cold waters of Maer Dualdon, but he managed to hold on to an "unbelievably massive" [[knucklehead]]â€”his prized catch of the day. When Ned got to the shore, though, he was rushed by a hungry [[bear]] who got away with most of the [[fish]], leaving the youth unharmed, holding on to the knucklehead's head. Ned returned to Targos and kept the head as proof of his misadventure and lucky survival. Eventually, Young Ned started to believe that his ''Lucky Knucky'' indeed possessed luck-granting powers. Sometime later, Ned lost the lucky item in a rigged card game against [[Marg the Trembler]]. The brigand fled Targos soon after while Young Ned couldn't muster the courage to stand up to Marg.
