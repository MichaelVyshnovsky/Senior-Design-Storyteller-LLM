'''Sully''' was a thug from the criminal underbelly of [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Sully was not afraid in getting his hands dirty and could go against the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] for a right price or in exchange for a right favor.

==Activities==
Sully had many connections within Waterdeep's crime organizations as well as more dangerous affiliations with the tomb-robbers in [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
Sometime in the 1490s DR, before the case of [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s stolen baby [[griffon]], Sully was acquainted with the [[halfling]] thief that later was recruited against his will to aid the Open Lord's stolen pet's retrieval. If the halfling thief were to fail his mission and flee Waterdeep, Sully was ready to lend him a hand in exchange for the little rogue's help with robbing a certain [[dwarf|dwarven]] tomb just outside of Neverwinter.
