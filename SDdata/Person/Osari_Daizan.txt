Osari Daizan was the daimyo of the province of Tifuido in Wa in the mid&ndash14 century DR.
Daizan was a good-natured and cheerful individual. He was a good administrator and was loved by his subjects. Daizan greatly respected all artists and musicians, being himself a good musician.
Daizan upheld a longstanding tradition among the members of the Osari clan, borne from one of the proverbs of the luck god Ababuio, of fishing every day for jellyfish. Every day he would go out to the beach at dawn with a net and attempt to catch some.
Osari Daizan was believed to be a descent of the god Ababuio.
In the , a number of strange killings plagued the city of Fochu, with Toshi being among the victims. Before her death Toshi had somehow deduced that the one responsible for the killings was an evil wu-jen named Za-Jikku, as well as what the killings were for, and instructed her former husband Minhiro to stop him. Minhiro fled back to Tifuido and told his nephew Daizan about the one responsible for the killings, however, the daimyo didnt fully believe his uncles words and acted too slowly.
Later however, through a dream Daizan became aware that Minhiro and a foreign adventuring party were fighting Za-Jikku. Finally acknowledging the truth of the tale of Minhiro, Daizan started praying for the heroes. Through another dream he would learn of Za-Jikkus defeat and he quickly went out in search of the heroes to congratulate them for their valiant acts.
