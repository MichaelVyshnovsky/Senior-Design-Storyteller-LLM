She had children<ref group="note">According to [[Ed Greenwood]]'s tweet, in noble circles of Baldur's Gate, wasn't uncommon to arrange marriages involving very young individuals, often intended to solidify legacies and alliances. Nevertheless, this tradition was losing popularity as the years go by, largely due to widespread dissatisfaction in these unions.<ref group="note">It could be that the same spell that had accelerated [[Skie Silvershield II|Skie's]] aging, was cast upon Alana., but some of them left Baldur's Gate in the 1470s [[DR]] and there was no information about where they had gone or what had become of them.
