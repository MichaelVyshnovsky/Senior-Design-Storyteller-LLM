|You mention this petty and insignificant war between the Cormyreans and the [[drow|Dark Elves]] of the [[Underdark]] as if I am obliviousâ€¦ I have observed it with mere passing interest. Their conflict does not affect me, therefore I am simply not concerned.

|Regardless of what you have said, I have decided I need to know more about this war. What with it being so close to my new home. I'm rather fond of it here. There are many nearby villages to plunder and people to eat.

Veraxiena was supremely arrogant and confident, as many elder dragons were, and considered lesser mortals a source of food and treasure. She was open to making deals with them, though, so long as she didn't have to do anything and was generously rewarded for it.

|Veraxiena, ending negotiations
}}
During the late 15{{th}} century DR, Veraxiena moved into her new home, a swampy patch of land in the depths of the King's Forest. In the shortly following [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Cormyrean [[adventurer]]s came across Veraxiena and tried to get her to take a side against the drow invaders. She was well aware of the potential threat posed by the forces of Cormyr and [[Sschindylryn]], but didn't care what they did with each other so long as they left her alone. After some fraught negotiations, she may have been convinced to avoid eating Cormyreans for the duration of the war in exchange for a large amount of treasure.
