Veraxiena was a great green dragon that dwelt within the Kings Forest of Cormyr in the 15 century DR.
Veraxiena was supremely arrogant and confident, as many elder dragons were, and considered lesser mortals a source of food and treasure. She was open to making deals with them, though, so long as she didnt have to do anything and was generously rewarded for it.
During the late 15 century DR, Veraxiena moved into her new home, a swampy patch of land in the depths of the Kings Forest. In the shortly following Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Cormyrean adventurers came across Veraxiena and tried to get her to take a side against the drow invaders. She was well aware of the potential threat posed by the forces of Cormyr and Sschindylryn, but didnt care what they did with each other so long as they left her alone. After some fraught negotiations, she may have been convinced to avoid eating Cormyreans for the duration of the war in exchange for a large amount of treasure.
