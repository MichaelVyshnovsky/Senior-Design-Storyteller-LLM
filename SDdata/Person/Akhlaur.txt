Akhlaur was a powerful conjurer and necromancer who lived in Halruaa during the midâ€“12 century DR.While Akhlaur was originally stated and statted to be a conjurer in The Shining South (1993), the novel The Magehound makes him a necromancer and Shining South (2004) follows suit. While this may retcon the existing lore, he is not given a necromancer class and his exploits are still based on conjuration magic. Therefore, this article presumes he is a conjurer who also practiced necromancy.
Akhlaur was only interested in increasing his power by researching dangerous magic. He eventually summoned a laraken that was beyond his control and he was taken against his will back to the creatures native plane.
Akhlaurs disappearance left a permanent gateway open to the Elemental Plane of Water, causing an unending flow of water to pour forth into the area known as Akhlaurs Swamp. Akhlaurs Tower, which contained a wealth of magic items, was also found here.
This powerful conjurer was rumored to own magical items that most wizards only dreamed about, leading to a steady supply of adventurers delving deep into Akhlaurs Swamp with hopes of finding priceless treasure.
In their youth, Ahklaur and Zalathorm Kirkson worked together to develop a spell that granted them both everlasting life.
Aklhaur was rescued in 1373 DR thanks to the efforts of the wild elf magehound Kiva and the sorceress Tzigone. After being released from the portal, Aklhaur launched an attack against Halruaa, triggering the Wizardwar. During the battle, Ahklaur faced Zalathorm, and they killed each other.
