Blazen Stoe () was one of the Blades in Mulmaster.
Stoe took great pride in his familys position and his role as a Blade. He was concerned that his son did not understand this. Stoe wanted for Sebastian a good marriage that would produce the next generation of the Stoe family.
Stoe was the father of Sebastian Stoe.
In 1491 DR, Stoes son fell in love with a girl who worked in a bar, and he felt she was a woman totally inappropriate for a Blades son. He confronted Sebastian, urging to him to break off the relationship but instead his son ran away from home. Later, at a great party in the Astrid Saj villa, Blazen Stoe hired an adventuring party to find and take the boy home.
