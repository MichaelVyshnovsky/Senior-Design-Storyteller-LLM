        "mainbody": "The self-styled Lord '''Byronae Trilluach''' was a mercenary in [[Skullport]].",
        "Personality": "Byronae still dressed in the typical Ardeep dress. He dismissed curiosity about his noble title by affecting annoyance or making the inquirer feel ignorant that she or he did not already know, a tactic that worked well with society snobs. He was a compassionate individual.",
        "History": "Byronae was born in [[Ardeep Forest]] to a [[moon elf]] woman and a [[human]] mercenary. In [[1367 DR]], he went to Skullport and soon became the leader of one of the three most powerful mercenary groups, thank to his numerous contacts outside [[Waterdeep]]. For this, he was constantly targeted by assassins hired by his competitors until he decided to remain closed up in his villa."
