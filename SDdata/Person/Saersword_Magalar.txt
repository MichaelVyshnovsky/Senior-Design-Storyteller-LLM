Saersword Magalar was a notable thief and swindler inhabiting Yeshpek along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Saersword had a silver tongue and usually able to manipulate others with ease.
A childhood disease left half of Saerswords face pockmarked, otherwise he would be considered a handsome youth. He had long hair.
Saersword employed children to be his spies and could call on a gang of toughs to back him up if necessary.
