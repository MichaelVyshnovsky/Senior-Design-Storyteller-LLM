        "mainbody": "Ssura () was an awakened snake that dwelled within the Shrine of Fangs on the Snout of Omgar during the late 15 century DR.\nFor a simple snake, Ssura possessed significant information abut the surrounding world. Ssura was aware of the history of Ubtao and his domain in Chult, along with the exploits of the yuan-ti Ras Nsi and his followers.\nAlong with its companion Yzleth, Ssura worshiped the god Merrshaulk. The pair detested other serpentine deities, especially Dendar the Night Serpent.\nAt some point, a wild geonid stole an idol of Merrshaulk from the Shrine of Fangs. Both Ssura and Tzleth sought to have it returned."
