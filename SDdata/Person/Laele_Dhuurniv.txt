Laele Dhuurniv was a female drow and the Matron mother of House Dhuurniv of Maerimydra.
Prior to the Weeping War, matron mother Laele Dhuurniv led the Maerimyran forces who wished to reclaim the Land Under Shadow. 
In 712 DR, she accepted the Spiders Truce which Aolis Ildacer offered the drow. However after battling alongside the elves in numerous battles against the Army of Darkness, Laele treacherously killed Aolis but was eventually killed in 713 DR by Aoliss wife, Amara Ildacer, thereby ending the truce.
After her death, her three daughters, Aunrae, Greyanna and Xullrae, took over leadership of House Dhuurniv.
