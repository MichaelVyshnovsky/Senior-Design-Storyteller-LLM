'''Laele Dhuurniv''' was a female [[drow]] and the [[Matron mother]] of [[House Dhuurniv]] of [[Maerimydra]].

==History==
Prior to the [[Weeping War]], [[matron mother]] Laele Dhuurniv led the [[Maerimyra]]n forces who wished to reclaim the [[Land Under Shadow]]. 
===Weeping War===
In [[712 DR]], she accepted the [[Spider's Truce]] which [[Aolis Ildacer]] offered the [[drow]]. However after battling alongside the elves in numerous battles against the [[Army of Darkness]], Laele treacherously killed Aolis but was eventually killed in [[713 DR]] by Aolis's wife, [[Amara Ildacer]], thereby ending the truce.
After her death, her three daughters, [[Aunrae Dhuurniv|Aunrae]], [[Greyanna Dhuurniv|Greyanna]] and [[Xullrae Dhuurniv|Xullrae]], took over leadership of [[House Dhuurniv]].
