He did not have any children.The Magister states that Namarra was held by Esmel Is \"descendants for three generations the fourth, Ereskas, bore Namarra north.\" That would make Ereskas the child of King Rhadik I and put his birth date in the early-to-mid 6 century, making the prince a century old before he ventured forth, and another 70 from there to his death.

When Ereskas died in the , he was entombed with Namarra within the city.\nThe Goblin Wars of the , resulted in Mirabar being overrun and looted.
