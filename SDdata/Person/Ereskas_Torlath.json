        "mainbody": "Prince '''Ereskas Torlath''' was a royal son of [[Amn]]'s [[Torlath]] dynasty who founded the city of [[Mirabar]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Ereskas was the son of King [[Esmel Torlath II]], and the younger brother of [[Esmel Torlath III|Esmel III]]. He did not have any children.''The Magister'' states that ''Namarra'' was held by Esmel I's \"descendants for three generations; the fourth, Ereskas, bore Namarra north.\" That would make Ereskas the child of King Rhadik I and put his birth date in the early-to-mid 6{{th}} century, making the prince a century old before he ventured forth, and another 70 from there to his death. The foundation date of the city and the structure of the Torlath family was set out in the later ''Lost Empires of Faer√ªn'' and ''The Grand History of the Realms'', and so can be considered a retcon that disregards the older vague statement of Ereskas's descent. Presuming that Ereskas was a young, energetic prince when he set out for glory and lived a long but natural lifespan, it would serve well for him to be the son of Esmel II and the younger brother of Esmel III.",
        "History": "Ereskas traveled north with the family blade ''[[Namarra]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|626}} and founded Mirabar atop of the ruins of ancient [[Gharraghaur]]. When Ereskas died in the {{YearlinkName|693}}, he was entombed with ''Namarra'' within the city.{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}\n\nThe [[Goblin Wars]] of the {{YearlinkName|753}}, resulted in Mirabar being overrun and looted. Ereskas's tomb was also raided, and ''Namarra'' was stolen and carried off by the [[goblin]] chief [[Nethaug]]."
