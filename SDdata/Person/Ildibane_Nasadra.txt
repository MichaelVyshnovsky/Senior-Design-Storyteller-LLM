'''Ildibane Nasadra''' was the archmage of [[Ched Nasad]] until its fall in the year [[1372 DR]].

==Possessions==
Ildibane was known to possess a ''[[lurker cloak]]'', an ''[[orb of radiance]]'', a ''[[ring of antivenom]]'', the ''[[robe of the Archmage of Ched Nasad]]'', a ''[[staff of the abyss]]'', and a ''[[wand of darkness]]''.

==History==
Ildibane was the twin brother of [[Aunrae Nasadra]]. When the twins were twelve years old, they forged the [[Spiderblood Pact]]. In time, thanks to the pact and his magical power, Ildibane ascended to the position of archmage, becoming the most powerful male of Ched Nasad.

In 1372 DR, however, Ildibane was helpless to stop the destruction of his city by the [[duergar]] [[stonefire]]
