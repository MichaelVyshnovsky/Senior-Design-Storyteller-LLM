'''Llemgradac''' was an [[emerald dragon]] and one of the [[Princes of Murgh么m]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Llemgradac was one of the princes of Murgh么m who participated in [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]''.

He was one of the dragons [[Alasklerbanbastos]] sought out to attack [[Luthcheq]] and destroy the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] after the [[dracolich]] and Brimstone discovered [[Aoth Fezim]] attempts to disrupt the ''xorvintaal''.

During the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], Llemgradac was freed of the compulsion of the ''xorvintaal'' by the [[dragonborn]] [[paladin]] [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], and he turned against Alasklerbanbastos and [[Tchazzar]]. He was killed by Alasklerbanbastos in the ensuing battle.
