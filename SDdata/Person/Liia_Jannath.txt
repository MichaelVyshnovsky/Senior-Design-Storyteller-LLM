Grand Duke Liia Jannath was one of the rulers of Baldurs Gate in the midâ€“14 century DR.
She had a discerning eye and never seemed to take things at face value.
Just prior to the War of the Shining Crusade, Duke Jannath took on an aspiring mage by the name of Imoen as her apprentice. She acted as a mentor of sorts to the young lady, instructing her in the way of the Art.
During the events of the iron crisis, in the , Jannath and her fellow Dukes were taken in by the charm and acumen of the Bhaalspawn Sarevok Anchev. After Entar Silvershield was slain, and Grand Duke Eltan was poisoned, Dukes Jannath and Belt believed in Sarevok enough to appoint him to the Council of Four. Despite Sarevoks eventual betrayal and defeat, Duke Jannath emerged from the crisis relatively unscathed.
By the , Duke Jannaths memory lived on with her family. Her descendants were ennobled as one of the patriar families of Baldurs Gate.
