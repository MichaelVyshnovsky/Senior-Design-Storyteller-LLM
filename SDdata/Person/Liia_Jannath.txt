'''Grand Duke Liia Jannath''' was one of the [[Council of Four|rulers]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=CotR-p27 />

==Personality==
She had a discerning eye and never seemed to take things at face value.

==Relationships==
Just prior to the [[War of the Shining Crusade]], Duke Jannath took on an aspiring [[mage]] by the name of [[Imoen]] as her apprentice. She acted as a mentor of sorts to the young lady, instructing her in the way of [[the Art]].

==History==
During the events of the [[iron crisis]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Jannath and her fellow Dukes were taken in by the charm and acumen of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok Anchev]]. After [[Entar Silvershield]] was slain, and Grand Duke [[Eltan]] was [[poison]]ed, Dukes Jannath and [[Belt (human)|Belt]] believed in Sarevok enough to appoint him to the [[Council of Four]]. Despite Sarevok's eventual betrayal and defeat, Duke Jannath emerged from the crisis relatively unscathed.

By the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Duke Jannath's memory lived on with her [[Jannath (family)|family]]. Her descendants were ennobled as one of the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|patriar families]] of Baldur's Gate.
