'''Bugenius''' (often called '''"Bug"''' by his master) was an eccentric [[sprite]] [[mage]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The mage had blonde hair and brown eyes. He wore a ''[[ring of wizardry]]''. Bugenius carried a ''[[spellbook]]'', and a ''[[wand of magic missile]]''. Bug liked to study [[magic]] and learn new [[spell]]s. Given his good nature, he was eager to destroy [[evil]] creatures.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Bugenius worked on the second level of the [[Mages' Guild (Myth Drannor)|Mages' Guild]] within [[Myth Drannor]]. He accidentally turned his master into a bug when he trying out a new ''[[polymorph]]'' spell. Bug, however, was able to restore his master two days later, but the superior mage was mad.
