        "mainbody": "'''Draak''' was one of the lieutenants of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] in [[1479 DR]].[[Derek Myers]]. \"The Xanathar: Beholder Crime Lord of Waterdeep.\" ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.",
        "History": "Born as a slave, Draak, thanks to his intelligence, managed to escape by orchestrating a revolt. Later he worked as a mercenary. \n\nArriving in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1478 DR]], Draak found some of his slavers and decided that their best punishment was to become themselves slaves. He achieved this retribution, gaining a huge profit. Impressed, the [[Xanathar]] offered him a chance to work in the slaving sector of the Xanathar's Guild and he accepted.\n\nIn 1479 DR, Draak was promoted to a lieutenant's position.",
        "Activities": "Draak supervised all the guild's activities involving slaving. He had few but very loyal subordinates. Normally he first contacted the buyer and later captured the slaves.",
        "Personality": "Draak was serious and gruff. He was an able leader that ruled using intimidation. He took pleasure from others' suffering. He had little loyalty toward the guild and cared nothing about its politics or the other lieutenants. He believed that very few beings deserved his respect and that all others were scum.",
        "Residence": "Draak resided in [[Skullport]], where everyone knew him. Often he did businesses in a tavern in [[Mistshore]].",
        "Relationship": "Draak often worked closely with [[Sial Sapphire]], needing her information.",
