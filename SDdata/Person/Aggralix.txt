==Description==
Aggralix was a fair-skinned, blonde, and blue-eyed [[gold dwarf]]. She had a clean-shaven face and wore a [[leather armor]] uniform of the Flaming Fist, armed with a [[heavy crossbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Aggralix was tasked with patrolling the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], near the [[Basilisk Gate]]. She was partnered with Fist [[Elthira Gossen]], a zealous woman who sought to protect the city from the agents of the encroaching [[Absolutist]] army. Fist Aggralix stood in awe, impressed with Elthira's harassment of common folk. Some of the people harassed by Elthira were [[Drongo Bixworth]] and his husband, [[Florean Bixworth]], who were detained and interrogated for the crime of loitering.
