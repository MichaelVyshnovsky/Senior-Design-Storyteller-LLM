'''Piergeiron Paladinson''' ({{Pronounce|peer|GEER|on|refs= He lived in [[Piergeiron's Palace]] in [[Waterdeep]]. 

Usually, the identities of the Lords of Waterdeep were concealed from the people, but Piergeiron was one of only four whose identities were known as of his tenure. He followed in the footsteps of his predecessors, Open Lords [[Ahghairon]], [[Baeron]], and [[Lhestyn]].

==Description==
Piergeiron was a tall, muscular, and strikingly handsome man with a firm jaw, and dark eyes. His hair was curly slightly greying at the temples, adding to the man's regal aura.

==Personality==
Piergeiron did not speak very often, understanding the tact of silence, and when he did, he spoke very slowly weighing his every word. This led to some of those around him nicknaming him "the Thickskull," although never in his presence.

He was aware of the nickname, sometimes even laughing about it. Piergeiron used this misconception of his mental capabilities to his advantage. Having his political enemies underestimate him led to often made slip-ups in the negotiations, giving the Open Lord an upper hand.

Piergeiron did not fear battle, he was quite capable of defending himself thanks to years of service prior to his life as a ruler. He preferred diplomacy to battle, but when he was pressed into a physical confrontation he fought with the knowledge he was blessed by his god.

==Activities==
[[File:LordsOfWaterdeep.png|thumb|right|250px|Piergeiron the Open Lord of [[Waterdeep]].]]

Every year on [[Ahghairon's Day]], Lord Piergeiron continued the tradition of stopping by a number of inns, taverns, and other establishments in order to offer his good will and best wishes to the Waterdhavian people.

==Relationships==
Piergerion's father [[Athar]], "the Shining Knight", was famed for slaying the great [[Red dragon|red wyrm]] [[Kistarianth|Kistarianth the Red]]. 

Piergeiron's first wife, [[Shaleen]], to whom he was married in his youth, died.  Piergeiron's second marriage was to [[Maethiira]], but she died as well in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, leaving him with one daughter, [[Aleena Paladinstar]], who left Waterdeep to explore the [[Cosmology|planes]]. 

Due to his position of power in Waterdeep, being above the guild law, he made a lot of enemies, including the [[Master Mariners' Guild]].  

Lord Piergeiron maintained strong ties with the royal family of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. He was an attendee at the wedding of [[Alicia Kendrick|Queen Alicia Kendrick]].

==Possessions==
Piergerion's favorite steed was [[Dreadnought (horse)|Dreadnought]].

He wore a set of [[full plate]] mail armor, his magical shining ''[[shield]] +1'', decorated with a warhammer and golden scales of [[Tyr]] atop its head. His [[holy avenger]] sword called ''[[Clamorour]]'' inherited from Piergerion's father [[Athar]].

Another notable [[holy avenger]] sword of his was ''[[Halcyon (sword)|Halcyon]]'', a beautiful blade decorated with filigreed etchings, extremely effective against doppelgangers.

==History==
Piergeiron was born to [[Athar]], "the Shining Knight, the Arm of Tyr," a famous adventurer, and a paladin whose reputation saw spread throughout the entire Northland. The rumors floated all around the Sword Coast claiming that Athar was once a Lord of Waterdeep, but the truth of the matter was elusive. A lot of people have been saying that Piergeiron was destined for the position of the Lord of Waterdeep himself ever since his childhood.

Piergeiron believed that he would serve Tyr better not wandering the lands adventuring, but establishing a strong central location. After creating a name for himself with heroic deeds and a career in the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], he gained great favor with then Open Lord Lhestyn. Lord Lhestyn designated the brave paladin as his successor; upon the former's death in the {{YearlinkName|1314}}, Piergeiron accepted the position of the Open Lord of Waterdeep.

Even Piergeiron's critics quickly came to understand and appreciate the young Lord's value. He became beloved by the general populace of Waterdeep for his diligence and ethics.

Piergeiron was severely wounded in the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, when [[Amril Zoar]] of the [[Zoar|exiled noble family]] maliciously attacked the Lords of Waterdeep, killing two others at the same time.

In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, during the [[Time of Troubles]], a purported [[avatar]] of [[Selûne]] arrived in Waterdeep. Piergeiron and [[Khelben Arunsun]] covertly watched her arrival at the [[House of the Moon]], while discussing the need for caution.{{Cite comic/DC ADD comic 19|14}} [[Shar|The avatar]] was later invited to a party at [[Castle Waterdeep]], which was attended by Piergeiron and Khelben. [[Fenn Estelmer]] introduced [[Kyriani]] to Piergeiron, and she shared her concerns. While she spoke more with Khelben, the [[Dark Army of the Night]] crashed the party, seeking to kidnap the avatar. Piergeiron ordered the City Guard to stop them, though the avatar took care of them herself. Afterward, Kyriani confronted the avatar, but they fought a spell-battle, only stopped when Piergeiron intervened, commanding even the goddess to restrain herself. He had the City Guard apprehend Kyriani.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|4-6,11,13,19}}

Later, a group of [[lawyers (Waterdeep)|lawyers]] approached Lord Piergeiron with an offer. The lawyers promised to streamline the handling of civil disputes as these took up increasing amounts of the [[Lord's Court]]'s time. They pushed Piergeiron for an agreement and he unwisely and hastily agreed, signing a contract between the lawyers and the city. Furthermore, Piergeiron received his own attorney. However, the lawyers were more interested in the letter of the law, while Piergeiron simply made rulings based on their recommendations. Khelben hatched a plan to force the lawyers to renege on their contract and evict them from the city.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|9-10,23}}

He was noted as being "well past 50 winters" at the end of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, but his actual age was unknown.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, during [[Halaster's Higharvestide]], Piergeiron slew [[Kistarianth|Kistarianth the Red]] when the dragon rose again as a [[dracolich]]. As of a a century later, his great feat was celebrated on [[Kythorn 20]] as the Waterdhavian holiday known as [[Dragondown]].

Still holding the seat of the Open Lord of Waterdeep in the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{DDTS}}, Lord Piergeiron was in the middle of a lavish wedding ceremony to [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]] (who looked a lot like the lord's long-lost love [[Shaleen]]), a descendant of the hero [[Boareskyr]]. The marriage was to bring prosperity to both Waterdeep and the Boareskyr family by establishing a profitable caravan route to [[Kara-Tur]], crossing the [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. In a swirl of conspiracies and murder attempts by ravenous [[doppelgangers]] and treacherous members of the [[Master Mariners' Guild]], the wedding was interrupted by a cloud of ''[[darkness]]'' and a group of summoned [[basal golem]]s who abducted the bride and disappeared with her into the faraway [[Utter East]]. Following the events of the failed wedding, Piergeiron fell mysteriously ill to his daughter's great distress. [[Aleena Paladinstar]] joined the rescue team assembled by [[Khelben Arunsun]] to rescue both Eidola and Piergeiron himself.

In [[Tarsakh]] of the the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Piergeiron, seven of his fellow Lords of Waterdeep, along with other heads of state from across the [[Heartlands]] and beyond held council with the [[Shadovar]] [[Princes of Shade|Prince]], [[Aglarel Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]], to discuss a potential alliance between the returned [[Netherese enclave|Netherese city]] and their new neighbors. The meeting went poorly, due in part to comments and actions made by Masked Lord [[Brian]], but lines of communication between the parties remained open. Despite the diplomatic setback, Prince Aglarel directed Shadovar's allies to aid the [[Army of the North]]—led by Waterdeep's own [[Laeral Silverhand]]—in its fight against the phaerimm, a demonstration good will to Piergeiron and the Masked Lords. Once again, Lord Brian insulted the Shadovar prince, an affront that Piergeiron did not condemn, and one that could not be forgiven by Aglarel. The Shadovar subsequently recalled their forces from the battlefield and refocused their efforts against the phaerimm elsewhere.

Piergeiron was remained as the Open Lord as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1379}} Piergeiron the Paladinson died in office of age and ill health, after several assassination attempts at the hands of those increasingly impatient to replace him with their various stooges.{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318739339304961| title =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}
