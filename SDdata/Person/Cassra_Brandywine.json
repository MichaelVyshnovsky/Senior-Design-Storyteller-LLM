        "mainbody": "Cassra Brandywine  was the head scribe of Mantors Library in Phlan in 1489 DR.\nCassra was a young but very smart woman. She was very busy and had no time for socializing. Thus Cassra became clumsy and socially awkward, often stammering when in front of more than two people.\nCassra was the Scribe Master of Mantors Library, the second-in-command of the Lord Sage of Phlan. \nIn 1489 DR, she was involved in a case of stolen books, as one of the books was originally from the Library."
