Neldryn Hawklyn was a male wizard who was one the most powerful magelords of Athalantar but was killed by the magister Dorgon Heamilolothtar.
Neldryn was the Royal Mage and the leader of the magelords that ruled the kingdom of Athalantar.
One night at a banquet, Neldryn attempted to impress his friends and colleagues by using the lost Netherese Crystal Chain of Blinding. He summoned the Magister, Dorgon Heamilolothtar, but Dorgon demonstrated himself too powerful and easily slew Neldryn and all the evil people at the dinner. This was secretly observed by a young Elminster Aumar, who for the first time was impressed by magic.
