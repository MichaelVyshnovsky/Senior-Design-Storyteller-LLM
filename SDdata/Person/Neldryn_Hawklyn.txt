'''Neldryn Hawklyn''' was a male [[wizard]] who was one the most powerful [[magelord]]s of [[Athalantar]] but was killed by the [[magister]] [[Dorgon Heamilolothtar]].

==History==
Neldryn was the Royal Mage and the leader of the [[magelord]]s that ruled the kingdom of Athalantar.

One night at a banquet, Neldryn attempted to impress his friends and colleagues by using the lost [[Netherese]] [[Crystal Chain of Blinding]]. He summoned the Magister, Dorgon Heamilolothtar, but Dorgon demonstrated himself too powerful and easily slew Neldryn and all the evil people at the dinner. This was secretly observed by a young [[Elminster Aumar]], who for the first time was impressed by [[magic]].
