Zerbin Gethrik was a cleric of Tempus in Chondath in 1358 DR.
Once Zerbin was a murderer on the Sword Coast until he escaped to Chondath to flee justice. There, however, he joined the church of Tempus and changed his life, settling in Timindar.
He became involved in the Battle of Thurgabanteth.
Zerbin, despite his unusual conversion, had become a true devotee of Tempus, following all the few rules of his church. However he complained about everything, mostly because nobody took his advice seriously. Zerbin ate and drank too much but was an able fighter and a good companion.
Zerbin was the best friend of Araband Tymin, son of the citys lord.
