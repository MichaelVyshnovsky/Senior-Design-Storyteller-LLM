Doriak of the Shells was a dwarven hunter operating out of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
Doriak was a hunter of jungle beasts, and his favored quarries included big claw crabs, red recluse spiders, and venomtail scorpions.
He traded bait and lures to hunters who impressed him, such as by bringing him trophies of their hunts.
Doriak was a member of the Hunters Guild of Chult, who congregated at Hunters Square in Port Nyanzaru.
When Volothamp Geddarm visited the city in the late 15 century DR, he became acquainted with Doriak of the Shells.
During the time of the death curse, Doriak was interested in helping other hunters to pursue a number of fearsome creatures, such as the manticore known as Rasalas, a massive big claw crab known as Karkinos, the giant spider called Chitters, and the fire scorpion Hedetet.
