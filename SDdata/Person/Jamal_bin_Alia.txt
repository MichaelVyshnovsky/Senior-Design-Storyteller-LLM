Jamal bin Alia was a member of the royal family of Medina al-Afyal in 1367 DR.
Jamal was easily intimidated by his mother Alia Jamal.
Jamal was the nephew of Padishah Alad bin Alaq bin Alonka. Since the padishahs first born son disappeared at sea, Jamal was a legitimate contender to succeed his uncle for the rulership of Medina al-Afyal, much to the delight of his mother.
