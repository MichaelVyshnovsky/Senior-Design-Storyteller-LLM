'''Kimmuriel Oblodra''' was a powerful [[psionicist]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] and one of the few survivors of the destruction of [[House Oblodra]]. He often served as the de facto leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] while [[Jarlaxle]] romped around the surface world. 

==Description==
Kimmuriel had an expressionless face that Jarlaxle often referred to as "soulless."

==Personality==
In stark contrast to other members of his [[House Oblodra|family]], Kimmuriel was unemotional, usually stony-faced and very difficult to get even the slightest of smiles out of, much less a laugh. His humor was very dry but often superbly clever. He had an "arrogant dislike" for the [[arcane]] arts, but he was willing to work with [[wizard]]s.

Originally, Kimmuriel's stance was that he would much rather improve his [[psionics|psionic]] powers or study [[illithid]]s than look after Bregan D'aerthe. As such, whenever he got the chance, he tried to persuade Jarlaxle to come back to Menzoberranzan so that he could get back to his own work.

==History==
===Pre-[[Spellplague]]===
Jarlaxle rescued Kimmuriel from certain death when [[House Oblodra]] was destroyed by [[House Baenre]] in [[1358 DR]]. When Rai-guy turned against Jarlaxle in [[1366 DR]], he was killed and Kimmuriel became Jarlaxle's second-in-command, essentially becoming the de facto leader of Bregan D'aerthe while Jarlaxle ran around with [[Artemis Entreri]] on the surface.

By [[1376 DR]], after Jarlaxle returned from the [[Bloodstone Lands]], Kimmuriel was still his second and was frequently the public face of dealings with the mercenary band while Jarlaxle ran off adventuring on the surface with [[Athrogate]] and others. Kimmuriel was, however, given the power to overrule Jarlaxle if he felt his master's involvement in matters of the surface world threatened the organization as a whole.

===Post-Spellplague===
By [[1463 DR]], Kimmuriel was understood to be the main leader of Bregan D'aerthe. In [[1468 DR]], Kimmuriel was serving as a liaison between Bregan D'aerthe, the [[illithids]], and [[Draygo Quick]] in return for Quick's forgiveness for the band's assault (organized by Jarlaxle) on his home.

By the 1480s, Jarlaxle appeared to take more control of Bregan D'aerthe, allowing Kimmuriel to spent time with [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]] and an illithid hive mind.

In [[1484 DR]], Kimmuriel began teaching psionics to Archmage [[Gromph Baenre]] in exchange for Gromph allowing Jarlaxle freedom to leave Menzoberranzan. That same year, after [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] was made the [[matron mother]] of [[House Do'Urden]], Kimmuriel slept with her, ostensibly in order to gain insight into her mind. He continued to tutor Gromph, which provided him insight into the archmage's mind. He aided Gromph in contacting [[Hartusk]], the leader of the horde of [[Many-Arrows]], which helped lead to their defeat. When [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was believed to be the [[Chosen]] of Mielikki and able to dispel the [[Darkening]], it was in fact Kimmuriel making a connection between Drizzt and Gromph in order for Gromph to dispel the Darkening.<ref name="VotID-p344> 

Unknown to the rest of Bregan D'aerthe (although perhaps known to Jarlaxle), Kimmuriel maintained contacts with the illithid [[Sept of Ill'Ghact]].

During the civil war in Menzoberranzan around [[1490 DR]], Kimmuriel accompanied Drizzt, [[Dab'nay Tr'arach]], and Jarlaxle into [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] to parlay with Matron [[Mez'Barris Armgo]], but it had turned out to be a trap where Mez'Barris caught Dab'nay and Kimmuriel in an impenetrable globe of magic. The only way out, according to Mez'Barris, was if Jarlaxle pledged himself and Bregan D'aerthe to Lolth. Kimmuriel, who had been storing kinetic energy in his body would have to seek release, effectively killing Dab'nay, but he refused and instead let all of that energy implode, leaving the globe covered in blood and viscera.<ref> With Kimmuriel presumed dead, Mez'Barris commanded her grandson [[Malagdorl Armgo]] to kill Jarlaxle and Drizzt. Instead, Malagdorl dropped ''[[Khazid'hea]]'' and killed his grandmother with his trident as he was being controlled by Kimmuriel's spirit.<ref>

==Relationships==
===Artemis Entreri===
[[Artemis Entreri]] and Kimmuriel detested each other.
