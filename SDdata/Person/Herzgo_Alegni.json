        "mainbody": "Herzgo Alegni was a Shadovar tiefling in charge of the Netherese search for Xinlenal in the Neverwinter Wood in the late 15 century DR.\nAlegni was very large in stature. He wore black studded leather armor, carried Charons Claw (a great red sword), and had a flowing cape.\nAs a young tiefling, Alegni joined the ranks of the Netherese, and despite their xenophobic nature, they were quick to accept him. He joined the Shadovar and became a battle leader.\nDuring one raid, Alegni and the Netherese plundered an elven village. Alegni raped Dahlia Sinfelle, just a child herself, and murdered her mother. Dahlia later gave birth to a baby boy, whom she threw over a cliff in front of Alegnis eyes. The baby, Effron, was crippled but Alegni took him to be raised in Netheril.\nAfter Jarlaxle betrayed Artemis Entreri to the Netherese, Draygo Quick obtained Charons Claw and subsequently gave it to Alegni. Alegni was able to use the sword to enslave Entreri, who operated under the alias \"Barrabus the Gray.\" Some time prior to the , the Netherese lord Draygo Quick sponsored Herzgo Alegni into the Circle of Power and recommended him for a mission to Neverwinter Wood to find the lost First Enclave, Xinlenal.\nIn the , Alegni ordered Barrabus to capture Dahlia, who was traveling with Drizzt DoUrden (Entreris old nemesis) and planning to kill Alegni. Barrabus ended up joining Dahlia and Drizzt in an attempt to exact revenge. The group confronted Alegni on the Winged Wyvern Bridge in Neverwinter and gravely injured him before he was able to retreat to the Shadowfell. They took Claw and believed Alegni dead, but in reality the tiefling was healed by clerics and ordered by Quick to return to retrieve the sword. He took a group of Shadovar, including members of Cavus Dun, to Gauntlgrym, where Dahlias group planned to destroy Claw and free Entreri. The Netherese failed and the sword was tossed into the pit of the primordial and presumed destroyed. Dahlia slew Alegni there in Gauntlgrym.\nAlegni carried Charons Claw and used this weapon in concert with a tuning forkâ€“like object to control Barrabus by striking the fork against Claw. \nAlegni used Charons Claw to enslave Barrabus the Gray (Artemis Entreri). Entreri hated his master but was forced to serve him because of the sword.\nEffron was the son of Alegni and Dahlia Sinfelle, whom Alegni had raped. Effron worked under Alegni for a time in Neverwinter, as he was an apprentice of Draygo Quick. The warlord despised his sons deformity and weakness, but a mutual hatred of Dahlia and orders from Quick kept them in partnership. After Alegnis death, Effron mourned his death and vowed revenge on Dahlia."
