Ebonsoul was a lich whose ship, Thepurls Diamond, was attacked and sunk by pirates in the Sea of Fallen Stars around the time of the Spellplague (1385 DR).
In 1481 DR, agents working for the halfling assassin guildmaster Pericolo Topolino discovered a shard of a Mirror of Opposition in Ebonsouls wrecked ship in a 200-foot-deep (61 meters) trench in the Sea of Fallen Stars some 12 leagues southwest off Aglaronds southwesternmost point. Because the wreck was so deep, Topolino had to rely on the reincarnated Regis, aka Spider, whose new body had watersoul genasi blood that allowed him to hold his breath for long periods of time. Regis dove to the wreck but inadvertently released Ebonsoul from imprisonment in his silver coffin. From the wreck, Regis was able to retrieve two magical items a ring immunity to infravision and heat sensing, and a magical three-bladed snake dagger, probably Ebonsouls own weapon, that released Ebonsouls specter upon delivering the killing blow.
A few days later, Ebonsoul appeared at Topolinos mansion in Delthuntle and killed the old halfling. Regis was forced to flee the city.  
In 1484 DR, he picked up Regis trail again at the Boareskyr Bridge. He caught up with Regis and the other Companions of the Hall just outside of Gauntlgrym. They were able to defeat Ebonsoul, and Catti-brie used a scroll (intended for Thibbledorf Pwent) to trap the lich inside a blood-red sapphire ring phylactery.
