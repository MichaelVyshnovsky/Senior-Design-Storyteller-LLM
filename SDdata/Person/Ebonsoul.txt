'''Ebonsoul''' was a [[lich]] whose ship, ''[[Thepurl's Diamond]]'', was attacked and sunk by pirates in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] around the time of the [[Spellplague]] ([[1385 DR]]).{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle|3674}}

==History==
In [[1481 DR]], agents working for the [[halfling]] [[assassin]] [[guild]]master [[Pericolo Topolino]] discovered a shard of a [[Mirror of Opposition]] in Ebonsoul's wrecked ship in a 200-foot-deep (61 meters) trench in the Sea of Fallen Stars some 12 leagues southwest off [[Aglarond]]'s southwesternmost point. Because the wreck was so deep, Topolino had to rely on the reincarnated [[Regis]], aka [[Spider Parrafin|Spider]], whose new body had [[watersoul genasi]] blood that allowed him to hold his breath for long periods of time. Regis dove to the wreck but inadvertently released Ebonsoul from imprisonment in his silver coffin.{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle|4490}} From the wreck, Regis was able to retrieve two magical items: a ring immunity to [[infravision]] and heat sensing, and a magical three-bladed snake dagger, probably Ebonsoul's own weapon, that released Ebonsoul's specter upon delivering the killing blow.

A few days later, Ebonsoul appeared at Topolino's mansion in [[Delthuntle]] and killed the old halfling. Regis was forced to flee the city.{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle|4584}}  

In [[1484 DR]], he picked up Regis' trail again at the [[Boareskyr Bridge]].{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle|6762}} He caught up with Regis and the other [[Companions of the Hall]] just outside of [[Gauntlgrym]]. They were able to defeat Ebonsoul, and [[Catti-brie]] used a scroll (intended for [[Thibbledorf Pwent]]) to trap the lich inside a blood-red sapphire ring [[phylactery]].
