He detested the kobolds that laired within the isles cave network, loathed its community of revolting ice toads, and became completely frightened by its ravenous ice troll denizens.\nSometime during or before the 1480s DR, Mend-nets became infected with some sort of disease. He was segregated from the rest of his tribes in the monster-filled caves that wound throughout Oyaviggaton,"
