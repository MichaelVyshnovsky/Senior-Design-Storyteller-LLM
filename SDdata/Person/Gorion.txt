'''Gorion''' was a learned [[sage]] and a respected member of the [[Harper]]s during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In his senior years Gorion lived in the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]], at least between his adventures around [[Faerûn]].<ref group="note">In the ''[[Baldur's Gate (novel)|Baldur's Gate]]'' novel Gorion is referred to as a [[monk]].

Perhaps Gorion's greatest legacy was his raising of the [[Bhaalspawn]] child [[Abdel Adrian]], who played a crucial part in the fulfillment of [[Alaundo]]'s prophecy regarding the god-children. He acted as the foster and guardian to Abdel, preparing him for a life in which he would arise as a hero and even a great ruler of [[Baldur's Gate]].

{{Quote|''"I felt obligated to raise you as my own. I have always thought of you as my child, and I hope you still think of me as your father."''|Gorion, in his note to Abdel}}

==Description==
In his later years he had a notably older-appearing old face, highlighted by a friendly expression and pointed, gray beard. He often wore his long, gray hair tied up in a ponytail.

==Possessions==
Gorion carried with him a simple [[dagger]] and often wore dark gray robes.

==Abilities==
Gorion was a skilled and powerful [[spellcaster]] capable of offensive [[arcane magic]] and [[spell]]s that could heal and alleviate grievous wounds.

==Relationships==
Gorion's friends among the Harpers included many notable personalities, including the ''Sage of Shadowdale'' [[Elminster Aumar]], and the [[Blackstaff]], [[Khelben Arunsun]]. He was well-acquainted with the [[elven]] Harper [[Entillis Fulsom]] and was close with the husband-and-wife duo, [[Khalid]] and [[Jaheira]]. He trusted the couple like no others, and entrusted them with the care of his foster son Abdel in the case he could no longer watch over him.

He was a lover to the woman [[Alianna]], who was in fact a [[priest]]ess of [[Bhaal]].

==History==
[[File:GorionProf.png|thumb|''A stylized depiction of the sage Gorion.'']]
In his younger years, Gorion had been an active adventurer and agent of the Harpers. Among other exploits, he had once faced the [[red dragon]] [[Firkraag]] and emerged alive and somewhat victorious, at least enough to have scarred the beast while keeping himself in one piece.

At some point around the {{YearlinkName|1347}} or [[1348 DR]], Gorion and his fellow Harpers learned about dark goings-on at a [[Temple of Bhaal (Forest of Wyrms)|temple]] of [[Bhaal]] in the [[Forest of Wyrms]]. There they found many Bhaalspawn children who they believed were being prepared for a mass-sacrifice. Gorion encountered Alianna at the temple and froze just before he slew her – immediately before she was mortally shot by an [[arrow]]. The Harpers were able to rescue some of the babes, and Gorion took in the infant Abdel as his own.

Gorion raised [[Abdel Adrian]] as his son at Candlekeep, offering him a sheltered life far removed from the danger his divine heritage would surely garner. He watched over the other Bhaalspawn child [[Imoen]], though she was largely cared for by the friendly innkeeper [[Winthrop]]. Gorion kept their divine heritage a secret from them, as well as others, sharing the sensitive information with no one else, save for his old friend and advisor on the issue Elminster. Gorion had kept the horrendous nature of his adoption a secret even after death, telling Abdel in a note that his mother died in childbirth.

Sometime around the [[Kythorn 19|19th of Kythorn]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}} Gorion was warned of the threat of another Bhaalspawn, [[Sarevok Anchev]] of the [[Iron Throne]], in a letter from his old friend Elminster. He sent out for Abdel so that they could flee the threat of Sarevok together. The night the pair fled from Candlekeep they were stopped by Sarevok and his henchmen. Gorion told Abdel to flee and fought off their attackers in order to buy him time to get to safety. While Gorion fought until the end, he was ultimately struck down by Sarevok in the dead of night.In the novel, Gorion is killed by a group of mercenaries working for Sarevok.
