Following up on this information, she was able to track Augathra to the fallen Netherese city of Synod in the . There she discovered Augathra just as the Mad Seer was completing a ritual to become a sharn. With the ritual disturbed, not only Augathra, but Shar Cormrael and a spying phaerimm named Xeris were caught up in the magic and all three were bound into a single sharn that in turn was bound to Synods mythallar. The resulting release of such strong magic lured more phaerimms to Synod, where they formed a coven to study (and torture) the newly created, trapped sharn."
