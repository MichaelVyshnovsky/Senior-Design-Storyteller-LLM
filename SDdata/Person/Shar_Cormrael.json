        "mainbody": "'''Shar Cormrael''' was a member of the [[Dark Diviners]] of [[Windsong Tower]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Named for the goddess [[Shar]] herself, she discovered information in the library of the tower that gave her insight into [[Augathra the Mad]]'s last journey. Following up on this information, she was able to track Augathra to the fallen [[Netheril|Netherese]] city of [[Synod]] in the {{YearlinkName|684}}. There she discovered Augathra just as the Mad Seer was completing a ritual to become a [[sharn]]. With the ritual disturbed, not only Augathra, but Shar Cormrael and a spying [[phaerimm]] named [[Xeris]] were caught up in the magic and all three were bound into a single sharn that in turn was bound to Synod's ''[[mythallar]]''. The resulting release of such strong magic lured more phaerimms to Synod, where they formed a coven to study (and torture) the newly created, trapped sharn."
