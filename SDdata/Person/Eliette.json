        "mainbody": "High elf\nEliette was a high elven woman who later became a phase spider matriarch that dwelled within the Whispering Depths caverns on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.\nNothing was known about the elven form of Eliette. After her transcension she became a huge blue spider with red pattern on her back.\nAfter her transformation, the matriarch learned to channel inner wrath. When she became severely injured, she would attack with greater force but became even more vulnerable to attacks from others.\nAt some point in her existence, the matriarch swallowed some humanoid creature wearing a set of poisoners robes.\nWhile in her humanoid form, the matriarch kept a small study and laboratory nestled within a cave in the upper reaches of the Whispering Depths.\nAccording to Eliettes Bloody Journal, her past on the surface of Faer√ªn was filled with regrets. At some point, she fell into the hands of a minor drow house. Throughout her captivity, Eliette devoted herself to the spider goddess, Lolth, witnessing visions of the houses demise and the death of their matron mother. Patiently awaiting the prophesied day, Eliette carefully planned her escape and managed to break free, reinforcing her allegiance to the goddess.\nWhile Eliette was dwelling in the caves of Whispering Depths, she heard whispers from the darkness, which she interpreted as speech from Lolth herself. She believed this was her calling to undergo a transformation. Some time later, she received a pair of spiderstep boots, a gift from the spiders within the surrounding caves.\nThe Tattered Journal said, that some time later, she found the dead body of a drow arachnomancer. Being of \"organ and bone\" Eliette dreamed of taking a form more appeasing to her goddess. She believed that the gifts from Lolth were the signs that the time of her transformation was at hand.\nWithin the pages of her Web-Covered Journal and Burnt Journal, she conveyed her eagerness about the chance to deepen her connection with the goddess. She decided to go through the ritual called Transcendence. In her cave study Eliette researched the ways to become a phase spider matriarch and kept most of her journals written in some manner of code, with notations added in common. She tried using some spells, but they were not enough. She had a Ritual Diagram describing the process of transcension. \nDuring or before the , the she made her final transition, taking on the form of the massive phase spider. Over the next while, it appeared as if she began to produce some manner of webbing from her body. She became capable of laying and hatching large clutches of eggs."
