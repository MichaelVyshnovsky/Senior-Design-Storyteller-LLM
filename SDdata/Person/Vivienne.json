When her husband was riding his [[horse]]-drawn plow, the [[iron]] deteriorated and he was crushed beneath the plow and dragged along for {{SI|20|yd}} by the panicked beasts. He remained in a state that was incurable by the [[priest]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]], and Vivienne's life was left in ruin.\n\nShe traveled to the [[Blushing Mermaid]] inn, seeking adventurers or anyone that would help end the calamity that befell the land she called home."
