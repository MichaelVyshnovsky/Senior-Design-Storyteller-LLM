        "mainbody": "ramas was a tiefling woman who was exiled from Elturel along with others of her kind, and forced to brave the roads and wilds of the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.\nEramas had medium-red skin and two large black horns. She preferred to dress in padded clothes with leather accessories, which included a hood she used to cover her features. \nIn the , all tieflings in Elturel were cast out of the city, following the catastrophic series of events collectively known as the Descent. Eramas was among the refugees who followed the exiled Hellrider Zevlor and his allies. They faced dangers on the road in the form of goblin raiders and briefly found safe haven at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave. The druids were less-than-hospitable however, as some within their ranks sought to perform a powerful ritual that would prevent the teiflings from remaining within.\nEramas was distraught over the whole situation and sought to gather goods for her own gain, with no concern for others."
