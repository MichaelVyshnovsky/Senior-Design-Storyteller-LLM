Voluril Ocing was an elven merchant of Marsember by day, and a jewel thief operating under the alias the Black Bandit by night.
He was a slender man with light skin and long, dark hair, clad in dark clothing.
Ocing led a double life, presenting himself as an honest merchant of Marsember, whilst secretly robbing jewels from the wealthy. He was skilled enough at his second trade to avoid detection by both the Harpers and the War Wizards. Ocings signature was a small, black doll left at the sites of his thefts.
