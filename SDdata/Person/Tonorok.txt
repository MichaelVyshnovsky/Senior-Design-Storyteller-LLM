Tonorok the Gladiator was a minotaur gladiator-slave in Hillsfars Arena in 1373 DR.
Tonorok was the current "monster gladiator hero" of the Arena in 1373 DR. As such, the Red Plumes provided him with free movement within the confines of the Arenas building, a private room, and proper meals, usually the bodies of the prisoners killed by Tonorok within the Arena.
After Tonotoks death his skeleton armed with a big axe continued to fight in gladiatorial arenas of Hillsfar circa 1490 DR. Still his attack was so strong that he could bring down an elefant.
