The Patriarch of Song was the overlord of the Church of Milil.
Despite being the highest ruler of his church, the identity of the Patriarch was a mystery to most people. He usually appeared as a male of venerable age with gentle features, knobby hands, a long white beard, and ice-blue eyes.
The patriarch was amongst the best harpists in the world. He was a wonderful singer, able to go from a deep and heavy voice to the clear high pitch of a young elven maiden.
The patriarch seemed able to change his appearance and gender, and would sometimes adopt new names, which contributed to the mystery surrounding his origins.
He was rumored to know a song so beautiful it would enthrall creatures listening to it, putting them in a trance during which they would only focus on the music soaring in their heads.
Sorlyn believed that the Patriarch was immortal, and that as long as he lived music would flourish on Faerûn.
The Patriarch owned a house in Waterdeep. In addition, he was in possession of the Bellows of Milil—a powerful pipe organ housed in the Arbalests House temple in Athkatla.
In 1358 DR, Milil gave the Patriarch the task of overseeing the development of Arbalests House, its most significant temple at that moment. 
While all churches paid heed to the Patriarch, his influence was stronger in northwest Faerûn and dwindled the further away one moved from Waterdeep. Distant congregations such as the ones in Sembia paid the Patriarch no more than lip service, and only paid attention to his most urgent communications.
