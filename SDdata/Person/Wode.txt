Wode the Guileful was a drow merchant who set up a trading camp in the Underdark in the early 14 century DR.
Wode sold wares in the area south of a House Despana camp, near Rilauven. The drow elf, along with his derro and dwarven associates, sold a large amount of wares. Their wares included weapons, armor, magically enhanced items, and ammunition.
He was boastful about his "glorious" home city of Ched Nasad. He referred to it as the "black opal of drow cities" and said it "gleams across the Underdark as a shining example to all others who hope to be truly great". The only city he felt was more welcoming to merchants was Sshamath.
Wode journeyed close to Rilauven every three years to meet with his associates, Myrvek and Heggr. He mentioned that "Old Heggr" disliked dealing with himself and Myrvek.
His market was decorated with fine spider silk carpets made by master craftsmen.
Wode was the only merchant among his associates who had a bodyguard. His guard, named Valas Rrostarr, was protective and did not like to engage in conversation.
He used axes in combat, making use of both their melee and throwing potential.
