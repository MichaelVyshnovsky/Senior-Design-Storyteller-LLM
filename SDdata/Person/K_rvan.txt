Dark Master '''K'rvan''' was a devoted high priest of [[Cyric]] and the leader of the [[Dark Redoubt]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
During his tenure as head of the Dark Redoubt, the temple's clergy and its congregation underwent significant transformation. He instituted a doctrine of spiritual discipline and instituted strict military training for all its members.

==History==
Dark Master K'rvan became the leader of the Dark Redoubt in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, after the temple's former head priest was slain by Watchful Skull [[Tynnos Argrim]] of the [[Mountain of Skulls]]. Argim then hand-selected K'rvan for the role, in order to maintain his control over the Dark Redoubt.
