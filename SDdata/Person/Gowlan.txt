Gowlan was a halibut fisherman from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Gowlan was a human man with a light skin tone, brown eyes, and a shaved head.
In the , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Gate, Gowlans fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the Gray Harbor. Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up nets filled with fish covered in black oily goo. Not just his catch, but also Fleers and Gowlans boat was soiled by the oil, leaving him frustrated and unable to lean the gunk off. To make things worse, Fleer and Gowlan fished a dead waveservant from the Gray Harbor. In reality, the fish were smothered in oil pollution left behind by a submersible used by the Cult of Bane to transport Lord Gortashs prisoners into the drowned Iron Throne headquarters prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor.
