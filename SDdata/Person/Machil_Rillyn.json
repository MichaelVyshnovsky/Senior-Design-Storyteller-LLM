        "Relationships": "The veteran mercenary was survived by his niece [[Yvandre Rillen|Yvandre]], and [[Taresson]], the Rillyn family butler.",
        "History": "When exploring the ancient library known as the [[Haven of the Red Quill]] within the ruins [[Delimbiyran (city)|Delimbiyran]] in the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Machil came across the magical book known as ''[[The Scrivener's Tale]]''. By uncovering the old tome, Machil inadvertently became afflicted the [[scrivener's mark]], a [[curse]] that caused the text of the book to gradually cover more and more of their body's surface as it transformed into shadowglass, a substance associated with the [[archfey]] [[Nintra Siotta]], who herself was closely linked with the tome.\n\nIn order to learn more about the curse and save himself from a grim fate, Machil traveled to the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]] to the south. Machil then donated the ''The Scrivener's Tale'' to Candlekeep's scholars, with the stipulation that it be secluded away with other dangerous works and be never read by another living soul.\n\nWhile the casting was successful and Machil was freed from the scrivener's mark, He was tragically slain within a month's time, unable to offer an apology to his family for the missteps he had made in life."
