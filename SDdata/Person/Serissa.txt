'''Serissa''' was the [[storm giant]] heiress sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
When Serissa was very young she went with her mother into the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Moonshae Isles]] to meet friendly small folk.

Serissa was the youngest daughter of king [[Hekaton]] at the time of the shattering of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]]. Like her mother [[Neri]], Serissa liked the small folk. When Neri was found dead, Serissa's uncle [[Uthor]] came to her and asked her to calm her father's rage.Â For succeeding in doing so, Hekaton named her his heir.

After her father's disappearance, Sarissa reluctantly ascended to the [[Wyrmskull Throne]] as regent. She ruled with the aid of several advisors.

==Personality==
Serissa above all feared a civil war among the different giant races, which had the potential restart the war against the [[dragon]]s. She knew well the envy of her older sisters but considered them harmless. Serissa trusted only [[Iymrith]] and her uncle Uthor. Despite the objections of her advisors, she decided to trust a band of small folk with finding her father and tracking down her mother's killer.
