        "Activities": "Though he appeared to be nothing more than a pathetic beggar, Khwaja was actually one of the most useful informants for [[Sa'id Firdawsi]], the spymaster for Prince [[Tannous al-Assad]]. He specialized in gaining information by getting into the households of rich families who took pity on him while they were hosting lavish parties with distinguished guests. While begging for food in the kitchens of these households, Khwaja often overheard useful bits of information from the loose-tongued serving staff.\n\nSa'id often had Khwaja follow important targets because of his ability to travel unnoticed."
