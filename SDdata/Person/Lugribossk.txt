'''Lugribossk'''(meaning "Fear Lord" or "feared master" in [[Undercommon]]){{Cite dragon/281/By Any Other Name|48-49}} was a [[proxy]] for the [[illithid]] god [[Ilsensine]].Lugribossk was also the name of the sole mindflayer deity worshipped in the [[Clusterspace|Astromundi Cluster crystal sphere]]. The relationship between Lugribossk the proxy and Lugribossk the god was unclear, as was the relation between the divine Lugribossk and Ilsensine. Ilsensine most often sent the proxy in the [[deity]]'s stead to effect events outside of its realm, the [[Caverns of Thought]]. It was often sent to help the illithid in bold plans of subjugating thrall races.

==Description==
Outside of combat, Lugribossk appeared as a normal [[ulitharid]] (a {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall, six tentacled illithid). 

When enraged or in combat, Lugribossk and its tentacles would grow to a height of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}, the nails on its hands and feet growing into black, menacing claws and its eyes glowing like beacon fires. Its skin turned mauve and left a trail of purple radiance wherever it walked.

==Powers==
In his normal form, Lugribossk was similar in ability to an average ulitharid. Lugribossk achieved his combat form by calling upon the power of Ilsensine, requiring about ten minutes to transform. Because of how long its tentacles grew to in its combat form, Lugribossk could not extract brains in that state, its tentacles being glorified battering rams that dripped with the flesh-dissolving enzyme that was often on a mind flayer's tentacles.

Luggribossk had access to more [[psionic]] energy than the vast majority of illithids. It had the ''[[ego whip]]'', ''[[id insinuation]]'', and ''[[psionic blast]]'' psionic attacks and access to all psionic defenses, as well as the psionic powers of ''[[control body]]'', ''[[levitation]]'', ''[[body equilibrium]]'', ''[[probability travel]]'', ''[[teleport (psionic)|teleport]]'', ''[[astral projection (psionic)|astral projection]]'', ''[[dominance]]'', ''[[awe]]'', ''[[ESP (psionic)|ESP]]'', and ''[[post-hypnotic suggestion]]''. The proxy also had access to the unique disciplines of ''[[taste link]]'', ''[[collapse time]]'', ''[[fatal attraction]]'', and ''[[shards (psionic)|shards]]''.

==Activities==
When incarnating in his ulitharid form, Lugribossk took on the role of an important Creedmaster of a distant illithid hive visiting for some important consultation.
