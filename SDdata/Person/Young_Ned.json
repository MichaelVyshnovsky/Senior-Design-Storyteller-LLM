        "mainbody": "Young Ned of Lonelywood was a fisher who made his name as the owner of Lucky Knucky in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.\nNed was a human man with light skin and gray hair. He spoke with a pirates drawl and thought himself to be the sharpest sailor in the area.\nYoung Ned was said to had been the best fisher on Maer Dualdon since his old Uncle Jed.\nThe first owner of the well-known lucky charm from Targos was Young Ned, circa . Young Ned often fished with his buddy, Thom Farold, who built a large boat he named Selara after his late wife. One day, Ned found his boat capsized in the cold waters of Maer Dualdon, but he managed to hold on to an \"unbelievably massive\" knuckleheadâ€”his prized catch of the day. When Ned got to the shore, though, he was rushed by a hungry bear who got away with most of the fish, leaving the youth unharmed, holding on to the knuckleheads head. Ned returned to Targos and kept the head as proof of his misadventure and lucky survival. Eventually, Young Ned started to believe that his Lucky Knucky indeed possessed luck-granting powers. Sometime later, Ned lost the lucky item in a rigged card game against Marg the Trembler. The brigand fled Targos soon after while Young Ned couldnt muster the courage to stand up to Marg."
