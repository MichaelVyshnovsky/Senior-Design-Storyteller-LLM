Juni was a villager of Highcliff on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Junis husband disappeared and Juni thought that the lizardlings have captured him. Mayne did not want to make a search for him, so the Kalach-Cha could find him. William, Junis husband, was hiding away from his wife near Highcliff Castle, as he does not want any more responsibilites. The Kalach-Cha could persuade him to come back or let him go. Coming back to Juni, the Kalach-Cha could also tell her the truth or lie.
