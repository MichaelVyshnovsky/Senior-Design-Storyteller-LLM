Rath was a druid of the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands during the late 15 century DR. He served Halsin well and was a druid in service to the Oak Father, Silvanus.
He was a human of dark olive skin and light green eyes.
Rath was compassionate and calm. He tried to defend Arabella, young tiefling girl, from a fellow druid, Kagha, who was using her viper named Teela to scare the girl.
As a druid, Rath was a skilled shapeshifter and spellcaster.
Rath served well his previous archdruid Halsin. He did not like the substitute archdruid Kagha as she hardly shared Halsins outlook on leadership.
Opposed to Kaghas isolationist and cruel outlook, Rath was willing to help those willing to track Halsin down and return him to the circle.
