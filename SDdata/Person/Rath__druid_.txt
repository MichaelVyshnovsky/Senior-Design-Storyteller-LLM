'''Rath''' was a [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He served [[Halsin]] well and was a druid in service to the Oak Father, [[Silvanus]].

==Description==
He was a [[human]] of dark olive skin and light green eyes.

==Personality==
Rath was compassionate and calm. He tried to defend [[Arabella]], young [[tiefling]] girl, from a fellow druid, [[Kagha]], who was using her [[viper]] named [[Teela]] to scare the girl.

==Abilities==
As a druid, Rath was a skilled [[shapeshifter]] and spellcaster.

==Relationships==
Rath served well his previous [[archdruid]] Halsin. He did not like the substitute archdruid Kagha as she hardly shared Halsin's outlook on leadership.

==History==
Opposed to Kagha's isolationist and cruel outlook, Rath was willing to help those willing to track Halsin down and return him to the circle.
