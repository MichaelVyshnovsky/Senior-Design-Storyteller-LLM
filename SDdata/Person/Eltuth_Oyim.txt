'''Eltuth Oiym''', known as '''"Wyvernmaster"''', was one of the Overwizards of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], Eltuth was known for the [[spell]]s he created to control and transform into [[wyvern]]s. He plotted to conquer [[Ruathym]], [[Tuern]], [[Evermeet]], and even the far-off land of [[Maztica]].

==History==
In [[1371 DR]], after [[Eldeluc]] and [[Valkebar]]'s coup against the Archmage Arcane, [[Arklem Greeth]], Eltuth pledged his loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a [[lich]] with some new [[devil]]ish allies, Eltuth was killed. 

==Personality==
Under a facade of being emotionless, Eltuth was very ambitious and loved destroying people and things with his spells.
