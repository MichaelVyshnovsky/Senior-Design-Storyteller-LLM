Eltuth Oiym, known as "Wyvernmaster", was one of the Overwizards of the Arcane Brotherhood in the 1360s DR.
Circa 1365 DR, Eltuth was known for the spells he created to control and transform into wyverns. He plotted to conquer Ruathym, Tuern, Evermeet, and even the far-off land of Maztica.
In 1371 DR, after Eldeluc and Valkebars coup against the Archmage Arcane, Arklem Greeth, Eltuth pledged his loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a lich with some new devilish allies, Eltuth was killed. 
Under a facade of being emotionless, Eltuth was very ambitious and loved destroying people and things with his spells.
