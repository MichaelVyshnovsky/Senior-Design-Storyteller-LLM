'''Sumcha''' was a [[human]] [[thief]] who claimed to be a merchant prince when he moved to [[Velprintalar]] in [[Aglarond]] around [[1358 DR]]. His real occupation was as a burglar in [[Sembia]], but he was forced to flee to Aglarond after stealing goods belonging to [[Zhentil Keep]]. He adopted Velprintalar as his new home, building and living in [[Sumcha's Tower]] with his family and servants.
