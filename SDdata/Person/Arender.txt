Arender was a legendary gnome architect and builder who lived in Tarmalune, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond.
Arender was the architect who designed and built almost all the manors of Arendermore, one of the wards of Tarmalune, a long time before the Spellplague.
His descendants became the most skilled builders in the history of Tarmalune.
