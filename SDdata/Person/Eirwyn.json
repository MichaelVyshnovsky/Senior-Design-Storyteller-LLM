        "Description": "Eirwyn had a silver braid and bronze skin.",
        "History": "When Helm died in [[1384 DR]], Eirwyn dedicated herself to righteousness, rather than to a particular god.\n\nEirwyn was a close friend of [[Tauran]]'s. Against the orders of the High Council of [[Tyr]], she aided Tauran when he began to express doubt about his faith in Tyr. She was imprisoned for her actions but later pardoned and sent to aid [[Erathaol]] the Seer, ruler of [[Venya]] in [[Mount Celestia]].\n\nErathaol convinced her to explore her visions, which led her to find Tauran again, along with his companions [[Aliisza]], [[Kael]], and [[Pharaun Mizzrym]]. She aided them in defending the [[Lifespring]] against [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and a [[demon]]ic invasion; she and [[Kael]] were the only members of that group to survive."
