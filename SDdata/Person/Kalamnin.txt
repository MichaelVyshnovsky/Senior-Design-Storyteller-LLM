Kalamnin was a warrior devotee of Amaunator from the ancient Netherese Empire, who lived over 3,000 years before Dale Reckoning.
Sometime around -3000 DR the Archwizard of Netheril named Pouldinus created a powerful enchanted bastard sword for his friend Kalamnin. The warriors strict devotion to Amaunator led him to wield the magic blade in the deitys service until his dying breath. The sword called Amaunators Legacy accompanied Kalamnin on his travels and left his hands when a dozen nycadaemons ended his life. The fiend summoner was the sorcerer named Ylmandi who became Amaunators Legacys next owner.
