'''Kalamnin''' was a [[warrior]] devotee of [[Amaunator]] from the ancient [[Netherese Empire]], who lived over 3,000 years before [[Dale Reckoning]].

==History==
Sometime around [[-3000 DR]] the [[Archwizard]] of Netheril named [[Pouldinus]] created a powerful [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]] for his friend Kalamnin. The warrior's strict devotion to Amaunator led him to wield the magic blade in the deity's service until his dying breath. The sword called ''[[Amaunator's Legacy]]'' accompanied Kalamnin on his travels and left his hands when a dozen [[nycadaemon]]s ended his life. The [[fiend]] summoner was the [[sorcerer]] named [[Ylmandi]] who became ''Amaunator's Legacy's'' next owner.
