'''Little Davey''' was the man who ran the [[Black Eye]] tavern and [[festhall]] in the city of [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I'm Little Davey. This is my tavern. If you want to fight, make sure you clean up the mess when you're done. No glass or blades. If I catch sight of one, you might just end up feeding the quelzarn.''|Little Davey}}

==Description==
Little Davey's name was a misnomer, as the man stood {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} tall and had a very muscular build. While behind the bar, he was covered in sweat, grime, and [[ale]]. Davey did not like spreading rumors or chatting up guests, however, he was willing to share information in exchange for some [[coin]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Little Davey was in charge of the Black Eye and co-owned it with two huge bouncer brothers [[Gregory]] and [[Marv]]. Despite the establishment being a tavern without any rental rooms, Little Davey allowed customers to just plunk themselves in the corner of the taproom along with other drunkards sleeping the revelry off. At that time, Davey also employed a dancer named [[Dimples]]. One day she stopped showing up for work. Being a popular entertainer, many customers had been asking for Dimples. Marv was worried for the woman and asked a band of adventurers to look into the dancer's disappearance. It turned out Dimples was a member of the city guard and twisted her ankle on the line of duty, rendering her unable to dance until the wound was healed.
