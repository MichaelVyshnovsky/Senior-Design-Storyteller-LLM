'''Anthony Illistine''' was the governor of [[Chondath]] during the midâ€“2{{nd}} century [[DR]] and member of the famed [[Illistine]] family. Following his acclaimed victory in the [[Battle of the Elven Tears]], he united the collective city-states of [[Arrabar]], [[Mussum]], [[Samra]], and [[Shamph]] under one rule.

==History==
By the year [[143 DR]], Lord Illistine had come to some significant level of power in the region that would be known as Chondath. During that year, when [[human]] loggers
were stopped from making further forays into the [[Chondalwood]] by the forest's [[wild elves]], Illistine saw an opportunity. He united the cities of Arrabar, Mussum, Samra and Shamph in an alliance, and in the winter of 143 DR, sacked the [[elven]] city of [[Ariel-than]] in what would come to be known as the Battle of Elven Tears.

Securing the source of logging for the region, Lord Illistine extended his power over the region. In [[144 DR]], some six months after the battle with the elves, Lord Illistine had ascended to the position of governor of the city-states of Chondath.
