Lady '''Madeline Whitburn''' was the wife of Lord [["Whit" Whitburn]], a member of the [[Parliament of Peers]], and a member of a [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Lady Madeline was a mature [[human]] woman with light skin with gray eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lord "Whit" Whitburn faced with the lack of "stiffness" in the bedrooms and Madeline purchased a remedy through her butler, [[Blathers]]. However, [[Rigid-Quik Cordial]] proved to be ineffective when mixed with a glass of Lord's evening [[sherry]]. Lady Whitburn wrote an angry letter of complaint regarding the cordial and demanded her money back or an alternative solution to the soft problem of her husband's.

When the [[Absolute crisis]] hit Baldur's Gate, the city's new Lord, [[Enver Gortash]], secretly behind the strife, was given names of eight members of the Parliament of Peers who were susceptible to influence. According to the [[Church of Bane|Black Hand of Loyalty]]'s research, Lady Madeline Whitburn was one of the nobles who would easily fall in line with the cult via bribery, blackmail, or direct threats.
