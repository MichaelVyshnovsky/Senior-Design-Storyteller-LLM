Penita was a sailor aboard the Lustrous Lass and sister to a cleric of the Open Hand Temple, Assuagia, in the late 15 century DR.
Penita was a rock gnome woman with a clean-shaven head.
In the , Captain Harfang sailed the Lustrous Lass to the Crone Island, where she made a deal with the Gloom Crone. Captain Harfang was granted "enough gold to last the rest of her life," but soon enough, the Captain realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold pieces among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, Harfang came down with deadly sea plague that ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a tenday after the deal was made.
The bodies of the dead, including Penitas, were left aboard the Lustrous Lass and quarantined after she drifted into the harbors of Baldurs Gate.
