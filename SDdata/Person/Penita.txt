'''Penita''' was a sailor aboard the ''[[Lustrous Lass]]'' and sister to a [[cleric]] of the [[Open Hand Temple]], [[Assuagia]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Penita was a [[rock gnome]] woman with a clean-shaven head.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Captain [[Harfang]] sailed the ''Lustrous Lass'' to the [[Crone Island]], where she made a deal with the [[Gloom Crone]]. Captain Harfang was granted "enough gold to last the rest of her life," but soon enough, the Captain realized that the bag of gold contained only six real gold [[coin|pieces]] among the dross. As soon as she tossed the false gold aboard, Harfang came down with deadly [[sea plague]] that ended the lives of the entire crew in a bit over a [[tenday]] after the deal was made.

The bodies of the dead, including Penita's, were left aboard the ''Lustrous Lass'' and quarantined after she drifted into the harbors of [[Baldur's Gate]].
