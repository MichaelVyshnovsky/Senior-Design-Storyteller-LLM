'''Tyaa Tymmyr''' was an [[assassin]] of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Tyaa was born in [[Daerlun]] as a scion of a merchant family and lived in wealth and privilege until a business partner of her father slaughtered all her family. Only Tyaay survived and she escaped to [[Westgate]], where she joined the church of [[Leira]]. By [[1358 DR]], she had risen through the ranks of the church, but the death of her goddess during the [[Time of Troubles]] forced Tyaa to go into hiding again.

She decided to join the Night Masks and become an assassin. With the death of [[Victor Dhostar]], no-one in the Night Masks still sought missing worshipers of Leira, and Tyaa discovered she enjoyed her new life. She commanded an elite assassin team specializing in killing hard-target merchants both in Westgate and [[Sembia]]. Tyaa greatly enjoyed killing old rivals of the father.
