        "mainbody": "aptain Skath was a tiefling mercenary and member of the Zhentarim in Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR. He commanded the militia of Targos, known as the Targos Guard, in the late 1480s DR.\nHe was a loyal henchman of Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr, leader of Targos.\nSkath was in his role when Auril the Frostmaiden descended onto Icewind Dale in the , spreading her unending winter, and Naerth, together with the Speakers of Bryn Shander and Easthaven, took the drastic step of holding monthly lotteries to determine who of the inhabitants was to be sacrificed to the Cold Goddess and cast out into the freezing tundra to die of exposure.\nFinally, in the winter of the , this period of strife culminated in an attack by a rampaging chardalyn dragon, a creature forged out of black ice by Xardorok Sunblight and unleashed to destroy each of the Ten Towns. Naerths personal spy network alerted him to the attacks on the other towns, giving Skath time to muster the militia and ready siege weaponry, though invisible duergar sabotaged these defense and murdered townsfolk. Fortunately, the creature was defeated by a group of adventurers and the efforts of the militias of the Ten Towns.In Rime of the Frostmaiden, the chardalyn dragons rampage proceeds depending on PCs actions, with it destroying towns in sequence. Since Targos appears in Honor Among Thieves and is the home of the protagonists before, during, and after these events, it could not have been destroyed, and was likely not even attacked. Nevertheless, in the worst-case scenario, Naerth would abandon the doomed town and leave Captain Skath to lead the defense his militia makes a last stand in front of the Luskan Arms inn, but does the most damage to the dragon."
