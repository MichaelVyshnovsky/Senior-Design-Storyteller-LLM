{{quote|''Look, my pets! Fresh meat for tomorrow stew. Seize her quickly - l'd like a nibble.''|Sister Horta}}

==Description==
Sister Horta presented herself as an extremely old [[human]] female with sickly greenish skin. Her hark hair was greasy and tangled. like a barb bush.

==Personality==
Horta was a connoisseur of [[humanoid]] meats and a glutton for tender flesh. She enjoyed cracking bones of recently slain creatures and sucking out the marrow. That passion was shared with her three bodyguards. She also cooked her victims into a [[stew]].

==Possessions==
The hag was accompanied by three loyal burly [[club]]-wielding [[ogre]]s who served as her bodyguards. Horta wore a powerful ''[[ring of wizardry]]''.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], Sister Horta wandered roads and jungle depths of Samarach, hunting for delicious humanoid victims. She sent her ogres to attack weaker and more tender creatures while avoiding more sizable and tougher play, claiming their flesh was as hard and unpalatable as a [[dinosaur]]'s.
