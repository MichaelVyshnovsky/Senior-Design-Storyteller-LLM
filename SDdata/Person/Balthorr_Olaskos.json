        "mainbody": "'''Balthorr \"the Bold\" Olaskos''' was a fence and trader in [[Waterdeep]] who specialized primarily in currency, coins, and various rare [[Item enchantment|trinkets]] during the mid-to-late 14<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Olaskos was often able to relate a story about any particular item on the spot. He operated out of his store, [[Balthorr's Rare and Wondrous Treasures]] within the city. His honesty was belled by his willingness to purchase coins, gems and regalia with no questions, but his suspected \"hot\" items were obtained at 40% the market value.",
        "Relationships": "Balthorr was also a spy for the [[Shadow Thieves]], becoming more involved in their affairs once they returned to Waterdeep."
