Sot was the not so famous innkeeper of the Laughing Goblin Inn though his pork and cabbage soup was renowned throughout Phlan.
Around 1290 DR, Sots grandfather was a cleric of Tyr and guardsman at Sokol Keep on Thorn Island., gave his grandfathers holy symbol of Tyr to Tarl Desanea, which was similar to Tarls own holy symbol but had different writing on it.
Though odd for some, Sot collected rare glass liquor bottles and he displayed these treasures behind his bar.
Sots weapon of choice for use at the inn and adjoining tavern was a large cudgel, which was basically a club or short staff. He and the cook would always reach instinctively for their cudgels when trouble was brewing at the inn.
