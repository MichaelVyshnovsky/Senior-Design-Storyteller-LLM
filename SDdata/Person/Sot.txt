'''Sot''' was the not so famous innkeeper of the [[Laughing Goblin Inn]] though his pork and cabbage soup was renowned throughout [[Phlan]].

==History==
Around [[1290 DR]], Sot's grandfather was a [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]] and guardsman at [[Sokol Keep]] on [[Thorn Island]]., gave his grandfather's holy symbol of Tyr to [[Tarl Desanea]], which was similar to Tarl's own holy symbol but had different writing on it.

==Personality==
Though odd for some, Sot collected rare glass liquor bottles and he displayed these treasures behind his bar.

==Equipment==
Sot's weapon of choice for use at the inn and adjoining tavern was a large cudgel, which was basically a [[club]] or short [[staff]]. He and the cook would always reach instinctively for their cudgels when trouble was brewing at the inn.
