        "mainbody": "{{Quote|''\"So be it. But involve me with any filthy magic and I swear there'll be a hell to pay\"''|Valygar}}\n'''Valygar Corthala''' was a member of the noble [[Amn]]ian [[Corthala]] family who eschewed his [[arcane]] heritage to live a life of his own. He sought to defend the natural world from the taint of [[arcane magic]].",
        "Personality": "Valygar was a decidedly stoic man who only spoke when he felt it was so required. He absolutely despised [[arcane magic]] and believed it twisted both the soul of its practitioners.\n\nUnlike many in the Realms, Valygar held no veneration for any deity.",
        "Possessions": "Among his possessions were a ''[[Corthala Family Armor|custom suit of chainmail]]'' and a ''[[Corthala family blade|unique katana]]'' that had been carried by members of his family.",
        "Relationships": "Valygar had few friends or acquaintances save for a few allied [[ranger]]s and his manservant [[Hervo]].",
        "History": "Many members of the Corthala family have demonstrated magical aptitude and skill throughout its generations. Among his ancestors was the powerful [[necromancer]], [[Lavok Corthala]].\n\nAt one point Valygar served in the Amnian military as a scout. He honed his skills as a martial fighter after years of fighting against unnatural beings.\n\nValygar's mother was a [[mage]] who suffered from mental health issues, like many in her family. This affliction was believed by Valygar to be a result of her arcane practices. She spent much of the family's wealth on magical items to the point of obsession and wholly neglected her son and husband.\n\nWhen Valygar's father died his mother was distraught. In her despair, she raised her partner as a [[zombie]] and underwent the process of becoming [[undead]] herself. Valygar slew both of his parents, a deed he felt he was forced to carry out.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Cowled Wizard]] [[Tolgerias]] began a manhunt for Valygar in [[Athkatla]], as he was the last member of his bloodline. Tolgerias sought to gain entry into the [[Planar Sphere]] that suddenly appeared in the slums of Athkatla a few weeks prior. Valygar fled to his cabin in the [[Umar Hills]], aided in hiding by [[Derrick]] and several other rangers. To circumvent the Cowled Wizard's pursuit, Valygar sought to secretly enter the sphere himself and bring an end to Lavok's schemes."
