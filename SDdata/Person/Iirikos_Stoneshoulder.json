        "mainbody": "'''Iirikos Stoneshoulder''' (also seen as '''Iirkos''') was a famed master [[dwarf]] artisan of the [[Stoneshoulder]] clan from the dwarven kingdom of [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] in the [[Northdark]] around the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the [[149 DR|Year of the Dwarf, 149 DR]], Iirikos Stoneshoulder and a team of dwarves from Ammarindar built a spectacular and beautiful arching stone bridge across the [[River Delimbiyr]] for some [[elven]] friends who lived in the area, at the place that would later be the settlement of [[Loudwater]].<ref group=\"note\">While Iirikos Stoneshoulder is not mentioned in ''Storm King's Thunder'', it is undoubtedly meant to be the same bridge.\n\nPresumably, the dwarf artisan also built a manor house for a local elf lord, and the settlement of Loudwater developed around it.<ref group=\"note\">''Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide'' only says \"a dwarf artisan\". This is assumed to be Iirikos Stoneshoulder for convenience, owing to the close association and terminology.\n\nAccording to local theories and the ''[[Hegredathas]]'', a written history of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], Iirikos also constructed the [[Granite Tower (Shining Falls)|Granite Tower]] standing in the village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]]. Proponents of the theory pointed to the similar stonework as proof. The ''Hegredathas'' related the story that Iirikos was commissioned by [[Silifrey the Spraystrider]], an [[Illuskan]] [[wizard]] rumored to practice dark magic. Ignoring the warnings and pleas of his elven friends, who were left bewildered by his choice, Iirikos built the Granite Tower swiftly using summoned [[elemental]]s. But he also installed magical wards that would activate and destroy any who worked evil magic within its walls. Silifrey was slain before a month had passed.\n\nIn addition, it was widely rumored that Iirikos built a great subterranean dwarven complex, which was accessed via caves behind [[Shining Falls]]. There was such a complexâ€”the Royal Caverns of [[Splendarrmornn]], the capital city of Ammarindar. The Royal Caverns were a legendary tomb of dwarf royalty,<ref>{{ Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Voices of the Lost, Part III: The Portal Stones of \"Voices of the Lost\"}}"
