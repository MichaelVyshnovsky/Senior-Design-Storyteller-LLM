'''Bronzefume''' was a weak [[dragon turtle]] in service to the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] at the [[Temple of the Crushing Wave]] in [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Bronzefume agreed to help the Cult in exchange for riches. She was a young and impressionable creature. She preferred to destroy boats more than people.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], [[Gar Shatterkeel]] convinced Bronzefume to help him in exchange for treasures. She patrolled a part of the temple, waiting for her next meeting with the water prophet.
