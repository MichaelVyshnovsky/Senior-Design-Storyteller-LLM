'''Cutter''' was an adventuring goon who worked with [[Shagbag]] and, at one time, with the [[dwarf]] [[berserker]] [[Korgan Bloodaxe]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Cutter was part of an adventuring band that consisted of Shagbag, Korgan Bloodaxe, [[Crazyface]], [[Scrooloose]], [[Stitch (adventurer)|Stitch]], and [[Hogbelly]]. The band collected valuable tomes for [[Pimlico]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. One day, the group erupted in violence over an especially prized bounty, ending the lives of Hogbelly, Stitch, and Cutter and leading to Korgan parting ways with the group.
