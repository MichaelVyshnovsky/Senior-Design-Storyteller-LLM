'''Logram Eyegouger''' was a [[barbarian]] [[orc]] and chieftain of the [[Eyegouger]] clan, the dominant clan under which all other orc clans surrounding the [[Old Owl Well]] served.

At one point, Logram allied with [[Black Garius]] and razed [[Neverwinter]]'s caravans. In the end, Logram's orcs captured a [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] emissary and the [[Kalach-Cha]] was sent to retrieve him. Logram was killed in the fighting.<ref>
