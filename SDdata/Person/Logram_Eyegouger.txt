Logram Eyegouger was a barbarian orc and chieftain of the Eyegouger clan, the dominant clan under which all other orc clans surrounding the Old Owl Well served.
At one point, Logram allied with Black Garius and razed Neverwinters caravans. In the end, Lograms orcs captured a Waterdhavian emissary and the Kalach-Cha was sent to retrieve him. Logram was killed in the fighting.
