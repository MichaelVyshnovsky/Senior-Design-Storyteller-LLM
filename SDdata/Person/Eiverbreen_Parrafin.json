        "mainbody": "'''Eiverbreen Parrafin''' was the father of [[Spider Parrafin]] (the reborn [[Regis]]).",
        "Personality": "Eiverbreen was a drunkard. He used his son's natural skills as a deep-sea diver as a source of income for himself.",
        "History": "In [[1463 DR]], Eiverbreen's wife [[Jolee Parrafin|Jolee]] gave birth to a son. Jolee died during the birth and Eiverbreen never recovered from the grief. In order to see if his son had [[genasi]] blood in him, he attempted to drown him in the sea.\n\nHe refused to give his son a name and became a drunkard, neglecting his son in impoverished conditions until his son was old enough to choose his own name ([[Spider Parrafin|Spider]]) and earn money for his father. Eiverbreen arranged for Spider to collect oysters for [[Pericolo Topolino]], who in turn provided room and board (and free alcohol) at the [[Lazy Fisher]] for Eiverbreen."
