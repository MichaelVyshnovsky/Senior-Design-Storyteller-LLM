'''Ihtafeer''' was a female [[rakshasa]] who posed as [[Adratha]], the potion seller at [[Druid Grove]], after killing the original. She was an enemy of the [[dao]] of [[Khan]] [[Zahraa]].

Eventually, [[Gorion's Ward]] became involved with the dao, who asked him to find and kill Ihtafeer. With the help of the [[Shadow Thief of Amn]] [[Itona]], Gorion's Ward unveiled Ithafeer's true identify and after fighting killed her. Later, Gorion's Ward took her head to the dao as proof of her death.<ref>
