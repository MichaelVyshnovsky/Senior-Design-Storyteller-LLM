'''Laclos''' was a [[Netherese]] [[cleric]] who owned and operated [[Laclos's Cremes and Candies]] in [[Karsus Enclave]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Laclos was a competent chocolatier, but most of the products at her factory were made by her employees [[Sneyders]] and [[Kiesewetter]]. Laclos ensured that the pair were paid better than she herself was to ensure that they didn't abandon her business.
