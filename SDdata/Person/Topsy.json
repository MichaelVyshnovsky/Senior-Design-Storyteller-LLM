        "Personality": "The [[gnome]] was very close to her twin brother Turvy. She was the more sociable of the duo. They feared that someone would discover that they were novice wererats who couldn't easily control their instincts.",
        "History": "Topsy and Turvy lived in [[Blingdenstone]]. Sometime in their past, they were infected with [[lycanthropy]].\n\nLater, during a trip to collect some mushrooms, she and her twin were captured by [[drow]] slavers of [[Velkynvelve]]."
