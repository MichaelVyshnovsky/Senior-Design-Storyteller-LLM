Maalthiir was a merchant and a wizard who came to rule the city of Hillsfar in the Moonsea in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
When Maalthiir was middle-aged, he was a tall, thin man with a crinkled face. He maintained a shaved scalp, but allowed stubble to grow on it and wore a long dark-gray goatee beard.
Maalthiir was a greedy, sadistic individual who had a distinct devotion to mercantile power. He regularly arranged for random executions and torture within his realm.
Maalthiir was noted as carrying a scepter with him. It was made of some dark metal and its head was the shape of a draconic claw.
Maalthiir was noted as having a single friend from before his rise to power Wak Rathar.
Maalthiir fostered a wizard apprentice, Mordak Brelliar, who acted as Maalthiirs chief advisor and second-in-command. Mordak intended to overthrow Maalthiir and foster an alliance with Zhentil Keep to rule the Moonsea by getting as close to him as possible, a plot of which Maalthiir was well aware.
In the first decade of Maalthiirs rule, rumors linked him romantically with a priestess of Umberlee named Dualah. After the marriage of Selfaril Uoumdolphin and Dmitra Flass, Maalthiir and Tola Vrass, the Khazark of Hillsfars Thayan enclave began to court each other.
Maalthiir was formerly a member of Hillsfars city council. Then, in the winter of 1356/57 DR,A timeline entry in the 2-edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting erroneously marked this date as 1354 DR, despite text earlier in the book and in future sourcebooks confirming the already established date. The latest source used the incorrect timeline as a reference and therefore states that it occurred in 1354 DR. Despite wiki policy of new lore replacing the old, because of this mistake, the original date is used here. Maalthiir overthrew the potentially corrupt Council of Hillsfar using blackmail and threats of harm.
When the City of Shade began attacking its neighbors in the , Maalthiir allied with his longtime foes, the Zhentarim and, even more shockingly, with the daemonfey of House Dlardrageth to fight in the Dalelands against the army of Seiveril Miritar. Maalthiir eventually betrayed House Dlardrageth by refusing to march his forces against Shadowdale and the daemonfey responded with overwhelming force, causing Maalthiir to flee Hillsfar and go into hiding.
Maalthiir returned twelve years later, retaking his place as First Lord and sending all of the nonhumans whod moved to the city during his absence to the citys arena.
Eight years later, in the , Maalthiir, who feared the increasing power of Myth Drannor, created a puppet council that included elves and half-elves and relaxed his xenophobic policies outside the city proper, hoping to prevent an incursion from the City of Song.
In the , Maalthiir attempted to make the transformation into undeath as a lich. His attempt went awry however, and he died.
