        "History": "Around [[1460 DR]], Nadir infiltrated the royal court of [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]] and killed several nobles until it was defeated by an adventuring party led by a [[paladin]] of [[Amaunator]] named [[Isteval]]. The rakshasa managed to kill Isteval's squire [[Eldrin Haunn]] but was eventually killed and send back to the [[Hells]].\n\nWhen Nadir managed to return to [[Faer√ªn]], it started plotting its revenge against Isteval.\n\nAround [[1480 DR]], Nadir located Isteval in the town of [[Daggerford]] and devised a plot to manipulate the schemes of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] to obtain several elemental keys from that region.\n\nFirst posing as the dead Red Wizard [[Arvik Zaltos]], Nadir manipulated [[Sjachmalsvir]], a [[black dragon]], to obtain the [[water key]].\n\nLater, still posing as Zaltos, it went to [[Illefarn|Mt. Illefarn]] to help Arvik's apprentices in locating the hammer of [[Derwin Stonecarver]], which was needed for obtaining the [[fire key]]. In the meantime, Nadir unveiled the betrayal of [[Skannon Tolker]].\n\nLastly, manipulating [[Darrondar Gweth]], Nadir attracted Sir Isteval to [[Dragonspear Castle]] where, with the help of a [[vampire]] cabal, he plotted to re-open a ''[[gate]]'' to the Nine Hells and have his ultimate revenge."
