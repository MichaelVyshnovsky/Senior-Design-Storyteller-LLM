        "mainbody": "Nadir was a rakshasa around 1480 DR.\nAround 1460 DR, Nadir infiltrated the royal court of Suzail in Cormyr and killed several nobles until it was defeated by an adventuring party led by a paladin of Amaunator named Isteval. The rakshasa managed to kill Istevals squire Eldrin Haunn but was eventually killed and send back to the Hells.\nWhen Nadir managed to return to Faer√ªn, it started plotting its revenge against Isteval.\nAround 1480 DR, Nadir located Isteval in the town of Daggerford and devised a plot to manipulate the schemes of the Red Wizards of Thay to obtain several elemental keys from that region.\nFirst posing as the dead Red Wizard Arvik Zaltos, Nadir manipulated Sjachmalsvir, a black dragon, to obtain the water key.\nLater, still posing as Zaltos, it went to Mt. Illefarn to help Arviks apprentices in locating the hammer of Derwin Stonecarver, which was needed for obtaining the fire key. In the meantime, Nadir unveiled the betrayal of Skannon Tolker.\nLastly, manipulating Darrondar Gweth, Nadir attracted Sir Isteval to Dragonspear Castle where, with the help of a vampire cabal, he plotted to re-open a gate to the Nine Hells and have his ultimate revenge."
