        "mainbody": "'''Frefford Wyvernspur''' was the child of [[Wohl Wyvernspur]] and [[Lamala Winter]] who married [[Gaylyn]] Dimswart in [[1357 DR]].",
        "Description": "Frefford liked wearing expensive clothes of the green and gold - the colors of his family.",
        "Relationships": "Frefford Wyvernspur and Gaylyn were fully and unconditionally in love with each other, and soon after the wedding they were expecting birth of their first child, [[Amber Leona Wyvernspur]].",
        "History": "Frefford and Gaylyn had her wedding ceremony in 1357 DR. The bride's father Dimswart spared no expense on the ceremony, trying to impress the Wyvernspur family. One of the things the bride's family laid [[gold]] for were services of a famous bard [[Olive Ruskettle]]). Shortly before the wedding, the bard was abducted by a [[red dragon]] prowling on the [[Storm Horns]] and a sellsword named [[Alias]] was hired to retrieve the entertainment. The swordswoman succeeded but the wedding celebration was interrupted after all when Alias, controlled by her azure bonds, attempted to assassinate who she believed was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], and who was in fact Frefford's darling cousin, [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]]. The attempt was foiled when the sellsword's friends collapsed the tent on the crowd. Even though Lady Leona was furious over this, Gaylyn, Frefford, and their friends emerged from under the tent giggling hysterically.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], Gaylyn and Freffie were blessed by their firstborn, [[Amber Leona Wyvernspur|Amberlee]]. Soon after, the newborn was kidnapped by an evil distant relative, [[Flattery Wyvernspur]]. He was using the child to get his hands on the Wyvernspur family's artifact heirloom, the [[Wyvvern's Spur|Wyvernspur]]. The child was eventually rescued by Giogioni Wyvernspur, Olive Ruskettle, aunt [[Dorath Wyvernspur]], and [[Cat (person)|Cat]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Frefford and Gaylyn attended a birthday party for King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]] at Lord [[Partic Thistle]]'s estate of [[Thistleflame Keep]]. They stayed overnight, and were questioned as to Lord Thistle's apparent murder that evening."
