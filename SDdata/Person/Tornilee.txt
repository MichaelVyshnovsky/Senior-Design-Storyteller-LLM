Tornilee was a ranger of mighty prowess from the town of Skull Crag in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Tornilee wielded an enchanted greatsword and wore banded mail.
Tornilee was a trusted comrade-at-arms of Yemandra Starbrow, a monster-slayer of the Roadwarden Guard.
In the early 1360s DR, when Arderiel was just 22 winters old, Arelin Starbrow, the heroic Roadwarden, perished in a treacherous monster ambush on the High Road. Her set of enchanted arms—the symbol of the office—were lost to the monsters. Subsequently, Yemandra Starbrow was tasked by her father with recovering the Lance of the Roadwarden. In her stead, Yemandra sent Tornilee, who was to join a group of caravan guards in the arms recovery. Together the group headed to a cavern claimed by hill giants who, along with other creatures, slew the Roadwarden. Tornilee battled through hordes of giants, and eventually they faced the true leader of the monsters a gluttonous blue dragon nicknamed Draconnis. After the wyrm was defeated, Tornilee and the adventurers retrieved the Lance of the Roadwarden from the dragons hoard.
