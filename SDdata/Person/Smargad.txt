'''Smargad''' was a [[dragon aging|great wyrm]] [[emerald dragon]] and a thane of the [[gem dragon]] [[god]] [[Sardior]].{{Cite dragon/37/That's not in the Monster Manual!|7,35,36}}{{Cite web/The Legend of Sardior}}

==Abilities==
Smargad possessed all the common powers of emerald dragons and was a master of [[psionics]], focusing on [[clairsentience]]. In particular, he knew the powers ''[[domination (psionic)|domination]]'', ''[[hypnosis (psionic)|hypnosis]]'', and ''[[teleport (psionic)|teleportation]]'' and all the psionic attacks (''[[mind thrust]]'', ''[[ego whip]]'', ''[[id insinuation]]'', ''[[psychic crush]]'', ''[[mind blast]]'') and defenses (''[[empty mind]]'', ''[[thought shield]]'', ''[[mental barrier]]'', ''[[intellect fortress]]'', ''[[tower of iron will]]'').

As a thane, Smargad had a continuous mental contact with Sardior and could be used for his remote viewing, though he could choose to block it.

==Activities==
Smargad and the other thanes normally resided within Sardior's [[Ruby Palace]] as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the [[material plane]] alone. Creatures that earned his favor might be rewarded with [[gem]]s, or sometimes some other gift or favor. He represented a certain facet of Sardior's personality.

On worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Smargad. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Smargad was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted [[psion]]s specializing in clairsentence. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. Followers of Smargad were called Smargadians.{{Cite web/The Church of Sardior}}

==Relationships==
Smargad served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the [[amethyst dragon]] [[Aleithilithos]], the [[crystal dragon]] [[Hrodel]], the [[sapphire dragon]] [[Charisma]], the [[topaz dragon]] [[Tithonnas]], and the destroyed [[obsidian dragon]] [[Seradess]].
