'''Ak'hafta''' was a [[drow]] soldier hunting [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] in [[Mithral Hall]] for [[Vierna Do'Urden]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], [[Artemis Entreri]] disguised himself as [[Regis]] and infiltrated Mithral Hall for [[Jarlaxle]] and his [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. The mercenary was working for Vierna Do'Urden, who wanted to sacrifice her brother to [[Lloth]].

===Death===
The dark elf used his [[levitate|levitation]] powers to descend a chute used by Drizzt to escape from his villainous sister. Thinking he had sneaked upon the [[ranger]] lying on the ground, Ak'hafta used his [[club]] to strike at the prone drow, but the soldier only hit an empty cloak. Drizzt, breaking his vow of not kill another of his kind a second time, slammed his [[scimitar]], [[Twinkle]], into Ak'hafta's exposed back. Later, Drizzt used a similar trick with Ak'hafta's body to confuse Artemis into thinking the drow's body was that of Drizzt, but it failed.

===Legacy of Ak'hafta===
After his death, Drizzt shot Artemis Entreri with Ak'hafta's [[hand crossbow]] while clinging to a cliff in Mithral Hall, after Artemis revealed he had a ''[[cloak of the bat]]'' which saved him from falling to his death. The powerful [[drow]] [[poison]] caused Entreri to fly into a mountain face after he lost control of his magical cloak.
