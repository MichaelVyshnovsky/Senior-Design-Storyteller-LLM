        "Description": "Myrmith Splendon was a handsome, clean-shaven man with light-brown, curly hair, light-blue eyes and a ragged scar across his forehead. His build was light and disarming, but his strength was easily proven in combat. He was always clad in [[chainmail]] with a black [[tabard]], alert and ready for action, even when he seemed distracted or totally unprepared. His fees were steep even in [[1357 DR]], but still there was often a wait list of a [[tenday]], a week or two may be necessary, or more to receive his good instruction unless one was willing to pay double.\n\nMyrmith could use any weapon he knew and could train a student in the use of it thoroughly, or assisted [[Fighter|fighters]] in improving their overall battle skills enough to allow them to advance a step in expertise. He fees were 190 [[Currency|gp]]/[[:Category:Classes|class level]] per week. His teaching skill was such that training, even when his home was full of students learning simultaneously, would take the minimum time necessary.",
        "Personality": "Since before [[1357 DR]], Myrmith would have those on the wait list who want to \"bump\" voluntarily pay double the fee so he would risk displeasure, and possible loss, of another client.\n\nHe had his students use his home's foundry to repair weapons they damaged, or modify those they wielded. He allowed the daily use of the variety of weapon specimens he mastered in his house.",
        "Relationships": "Circa [[1357 DR]] and [[1368 DR]], a competitor of Myrmith was [[Varbrace Zaalen]]. He discouraged adventuring because of the risks too high for the potential profits.\n\nHis [[wizard]] friends were continuously experimenting and improving his house's \"snooks\".\n\nOne sword-fighting student of his was [[Church of Helm|Helmite]] [[paladin]] [[Ajantis Ilvastarr]] of the noble [[Ilvastarr]] family of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Activities": "Myrmith acted as a \"captain-at-arms\", a kind of tutor to fighters, teaching bladed weapons and polearms. He did not try to master any particular weapon himself, but instead preferred to learn all kinds of different weapons and master the greatest number. Myrmith was an excellent teacher and was usually busy at his house, [[The Snookery]], in [[Spindle Street]] teaching students (clients).\n\nThe \"[[The Snookery|snooks]]\" on his house were unshakably loyal to Myrmith and even magic could not turn them against him. He also could control his house defense's seven magical, ''+2 [[Flying dagger|flying daggers]]''. These daggers could not be affected by any type of [[Magic|magical]] or [[Psionics|psionic]] control except by Myrmith, and they were immune to [[Magic missile|''magic missile'']] and all [[:Category:Lightning spells|lightning]] or [[:Category:Electricity spells|electrical]]-based magic, which the daggers reflect back 100% on the source.\n\nCirca [[1368 DR]], one story told of him pinning someone to a wall by their necklace with a thrown dagger, all while laughing uproarious at a joke."
