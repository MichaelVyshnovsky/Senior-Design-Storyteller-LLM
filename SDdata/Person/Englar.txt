Englar was a Red Wizard of Thay in the late 14 century DR.
In the aftermath of the early spring  War Wizard raid on the meeting of the Rightful Conspiracy in Marsember, the Red Wizard Narvo mentioned Englar during a debriefing to a superior through a speaking stone. He claimed Englar was not reachable through a mindlink spell, very strongly implying he had perished.
