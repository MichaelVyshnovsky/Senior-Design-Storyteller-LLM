'''Englar''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the aftermath of the early spring {{yearlink|1373}} [[War Wizard]] raid on the meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] in [[Marsember]], the Red Wizard [[Narvo]] mentioned Englar during a debriefing to a superior through a ''[[speaking stone]]''. He claimed Englar was not reachable through a ''[[mindlink]]'' spell, very strongly implying he had perished.
