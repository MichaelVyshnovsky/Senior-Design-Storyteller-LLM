Aldernar was a cousin of Ivus Barbarak, the proprietor of the Holdfast Inn in Liams Hold in the late 14 century DR.
Aldernar was a member of the Amnian navy and often found himself traveling across the Sea of Swords. During that time, he resided in the city of Athkatla. At one point before 1372 DR, Aldernar sent his dead cousin a huge curious nautilus shell he claimed to have found on the Moonshae Isles. However, Ivus Barbarak suspected the sailor simply bought the shell in the markets of the Waukeens Promenade.
