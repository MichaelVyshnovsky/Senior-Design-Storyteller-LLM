Harlotharaur was a black dragon wyrm in Amn.
Once Harlotharaur waged a campaign of destruction against humanity so Elminster defeated and bound Harlotharaur to a deep mountain cavern on the northern edge of Amn.
In 1487 DR, Elminster summoned him to Myth Drannor in order to create chaos among the Sembian mercenaries and bound Harlotharaur to that city instead.
