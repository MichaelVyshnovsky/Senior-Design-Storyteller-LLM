'''Logi''' was a [[fire giant]] in [[Jotunheim]], the land of [[giant]]s in the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] journeyed to the plane of Ysgard in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]], having been instructed by the city's [[Ministry of Art]] to do so in order to learn how a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]'' could be destroyed.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} While in traveling in Jotunheim they met [[Habrok Icecaster]] and, after proving their worth to him by slaying a [[bulette]], he brought them to the beer-hall [[Okalnir]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|18-19}} Sensing the hall's giants were indifferent towards the adventurers, the hall's proprietor [[Brimir]] proposed a contest of four tests. He was even willing to wager three [[magic item]]s if the adventurers would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a ''[[Svartalfheim cloak]]'', a ''[[horn of Valhalla]]'', and a great war [[maul]] known as ''[[Grungir's hammer]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21,25,36}}

Logi, who was visiting Okalnir at the time, was chosen as the giant champion of eating. In the first of four tests, they competed to be the first to reach the middle of a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} long trencher filled with stew.
