'''Othovir''' was a shopkeeper in [[Triboar]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Description==
Othovir was a handsome and charismatic male human of [[Illuskan]] stock.

==Personality==
Othovir cared greatly about his good name. He became angry if he found out someone was looking into his private life or his past.

==Abilities==
He was a skilled leatherworker and made his living making harnesses for horses and other domesticated beasts. He was a natural spellcaster, able to cast a few [[sorcerer]] spells. He was also proficient with a [[rapier]].

==Possessions==
He was the owner and proprietor of [[Othovir's Harness Shop]] in Triboar.

==Activities==
Othovir created tack and harnesses out of [[elk]] hide that were works of art. His skill was unsurpassed in the [[Dessarin Valley]] and his designs prized among the nobles of [[Waterdeep]] who kept horses. He hunted and skinned the elk himself, selling the meat and other parts to the [[Lionshield Coster]] outpost in town.

==History==
Othovir was a member of the noble [[House Margaster|Margaster]] family in Waterdeep but moved to Triboar and dropped his surname when some of his family tried to convert him to worship [[Asmodeus]] in secret. Because of his abhorrence for the corruption spreading through his family, he never spoke about his past, his nobility, or his family ties.
