She was the wife of Miintir, a famed jeweler in Imdolphyn.
Tiilra was a talented singer, popular across the Windrise Ports. Many considered her a "social beast" whose fame and wit could be more devastating than any blade. She was married to Miintir, a wealthy jeweler who supplied many of the rich in Imdolphyn.
In 1480 DR, Tiilra, alongside other renowned individuals of Imdolphyn, was kidnapped by the Cult of Reborn Flame, who intended to use them as a sacrifice in a ritual to awaken the primordial Achazar. She may have been saved by a band of adventurers.
