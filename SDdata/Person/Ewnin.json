        "mainbody": "'''Ewnin''' was the son of Count [[Fisfnilt]], a nobleman of [[Toril]], who lived some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Count Fisfnilt was attempting to find a \"suitable\" bride for Ewnin, who rejected countless women from across [[Faerûn]] for not meeting his unrealistically high standards. After Count grew exhausted with his progeny, he ordered a court [[wizard]] to create a ''[[ring of human influence]]''. The [[ring]] was gifted to a certain woman of great influence in a large nation. Ewnin fell in love with the woman, and they wed three weeks later."
