Zegdar was a minotaur chieftain and an ally of the Cult of the Eternal Flame at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Zegdar led the Emberhorn tribe.
In 1491 DR, Vanifer sent Wyx, a nothic fire cultist, to Zegdar. Wyx convinced Zegdar to ally with the Eternal Flame. However, some adventurers infiltrated the Fane and confronted and defeated him.
