'''Glooglugogg''' was a [[kuo-toa]] [[Sea mother whip|whip]] living in [[Sloobludop]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Glooglugogg was very loyal to his goddess and his father.

==History==
Glooglugogg lived quietly in the village of Sloobludop on the [[Darklake]], ruled by his father [[Ploopploopeen]]. He took care of [[Blibdoolpoolp]]'s temple.

Glooglugogg, Ploopploopeen, some guards, and the adventurers went to Leemooggoogoon's temple in the guise of offering sacrifices. Bloppblippodd was pleased of her supposed victory over her father, and, after first sacrificing the [[duergar]] [[Hemeth]], she intended to sacrifice the adventurers, but at that time the adventurers, Ploopploopeen, Glooglugogg, and his warriors attacked her and her lieutenants, all part of his plan to infiltrate the temple disguised to cut off the head of her cult. At this point, however, "Leemooggoogoon", along with dozens of [[ixitxachitl]], rose from Darklake and started to destroy Sloobludop, killing all present.
