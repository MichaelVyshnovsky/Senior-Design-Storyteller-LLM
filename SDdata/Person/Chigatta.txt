'''Chigatta''' was a reclusive artisan, weaponsmith, and master of mystic arts in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/181/Bazaar of the Bizarre|30,32}}<ref group="note">It is unknown where in Kara-Tur; [[Wa]] and [[Kozakura]] are two likely candidates.

==History==
Some time before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]],<ref group="note">The date is unknown; this is only "many years ago" from a presumed setting date of [[1357 DR]]. The Faerûnian calendar is used in the absence of any other. a [[daimyo]] named [[Hoshi Katahiroi]] commissioned Chigatta to forge a weapon that could destroy the dragon, spirit and body, that was devastating his province. Chigatta created a [[katana]], more fine than anyone could've imagined, and gave it the name of the dragon it was meant to slay, ''[[Celestial Fury]]''.

Hoshi was victorious, slaying the dragon's body and trapping its spirit inside his sword, now a sentient weapons. To celebrate his triumph, and cement the dragon's defeat, Hoshi then asked Chigatta to craft a scabbard from the dragon's [[dragonhide|hide]], ornamented with the dragon's magical [[pearl]].

Unfortunately, the dragon's spirit possessed Hoshi and, under its control, he killed first Chigatta, and then himself. ''Celestial Fury'' continued to desire revenge on the descendants of Hoshi Katahiroi and Chigatta.
