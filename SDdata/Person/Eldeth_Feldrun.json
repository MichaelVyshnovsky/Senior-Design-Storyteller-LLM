        "History": "Eldeth lived with her family in [[Gauntlgrym]], where she worked as a scout.\n\nIn the late 1480s DR, Eldeth was captured by the drow slavers of [[Velkynvelve]] and had been attempting to return home.",
        "Personality": "The dwarf was high-spirited, defiant and self-sacrificing, and she had great pride in her heritage and in her people's recent reclamation of Gauntlgrym. She was also stubborn and hated [[drow]] and other \"corrupt dark dwellers\" like [[derro]] and [[duergar]]."
