        "mainbody": "etunia was a cow on the Butterskull Ranch owned by Alfonse Kalazorn. He used Petunias milk to make lumps of butter and mold them into the shapes of humanoid skulls. The sale of these butter skulls gave the ranch its name.\nPetunia wore a cowbell around her neck and her hindquarters were branded with the letters BAK, which stood for \"Big Al Kalazorn\", her owner. Petunia had a calm, unflappable demeanor.\nIn 1492 DR, the ranch was attacked by a small band of orcs who had been driven from Icespire Hold by the white dragon Cryovain. During the attack, Petunia escaped alongside a few other animals. She was later found between Conyberry and Butterskull Ranch a few hundred feet off the Triboar Trail by some adventurers."
