        "mainbody": "'''Petunia''' was a [[cow]] on the [[Butterskull Ranch]] owned by [[Alfonse Kalazorn]]. He used Petunia's [[milk]] to make lumps of butter and mold them into the shapes of humanoid skulls. The sale of these butter skulls gave the ranch its name.",
        "Description": "Petunia wore a cowbell around her neck and her hindquarters were branded with the letters BAK, which stood for \"Big Al Kalazorn\", her owner. Petunia had a calm, unflappable demeanor.",
        "History": "In [[1492 DR]], the ranch was attacked by a small band of [[orcs]] who had been driven from [[Icespire Hold]] by the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]]. During the attack, Petunia escaped alongside a few other animals. She was later found between [[Conyberry]] and Butterskull Ranch a few hundred feet off the [[Triboar Trail]] by some adventurers."
