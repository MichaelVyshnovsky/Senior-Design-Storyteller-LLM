        "mainbody": "'''Diana''', or '''the Acrobat''', was a [[monk]] and an [[adventurer]] from [[Earth]] and [[the Realm]] ([[Forgotten Realms|no relation]]). She was a companion of the [[barbarian]] [[Bobby]], the [[fighter]] [[Eric]], the [[ranger]] [[Hank]], the [[wizard]] [[Presto]], and the [[rogue]] [[Sheila]].{{Cite comic/Saturday Morning Adventures 1}}",
        "Personality": "Diana was brave, confident and smart, as well as outspoken. When the leader of their adventuring group, Hank, was not around, she would lead the others quite capably. She was proud of her physical prowess, and the only thing she was feared was to lose her edge. She did have a tendency to put up with other people's failings.",
        "Abilities": "Diana fought with her staff, which she could extend in length, She was very agile.\n\nShe also learned to use [[magic]] related to animals.",
        "Possessions": "Diana fought with a ''[[javelin staff]]''",
        "History": {
            "The Victims of Tiamat": "Living long before the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], she was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by [[Tiamat]], together with their miniature unicorn. By [[1369 DR]], the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], displayed paintings of her two friends, Hank and Bobby.",
            "The Grand Tour of the Realms": "In the 1360s DR, Diana and her friends visited the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] in [[Faerûn]] so that Presto could ask the great sage [[Elminster]] to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the [[Old Skull Inn]], they spotted Elminster, and though Eric dismissed him as old, Diana thought he looked pretty good for his age and warned that \"wizards have ears like a [[fox]].\" When Presto lost his nerve, the kind monk reassured the wizard that he did not have to. Yet she stood beside him to declare his suitability to Elminster.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}\n\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\n\nAt this time, now an adult, the monk looked very similar but was very muscled. Diana kept similar apparel, from her top and shorts to her armband to her circlet. She still carried a [[staff]].",
            "The High Sun Games": "In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Diana and her friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the [[High Sun Games]] hosted by Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] in the newly built [[Neverwinter arena|arena]] in [[Neverwinter]]. They evaded the [[displacer beast]] and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Sofina]] used the ''[[horn of beckoning death]]'' above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group=\"note\">After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The ''beckoning death'' smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.",
            "Went to Waterdeep": "Aged only 14, Diana and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried [[potato]]es they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but Diana and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then [[drider]]s and [[darkmantle]]s ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious ''[[portal]]'' that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of [[Waterdeep]], now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.\n{{Sectstub}}"
