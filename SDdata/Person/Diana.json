        "mainbody": "Diana, or the Acrobat, was a monk and an adventurer from Earth and the Realm (no relation). She was a companion of the barbarian Bobby, the fighter Eric, the ranger Hank, the wizard Presto, and the rogue Sheila.\nDiana was brave, confident and smart, as well as outspoken. When the leader of their adventuring group, Hank, was not around, she would lead the others quite capably. She was proud of her physical prowess, and the only thing she was feared was to lose her edge. She did have a tendency to put up with other peoples failings.\nDiana fought with her staff, which she could extend in length, She was very agile.\nShe also learned to use magic related to animals.\nDiana fought with a javelin staff\nDiana and her friends were originally from Earth, They were later in some place they called \"the Forgotten Realms\", evidently not knowing the difference. Aiding by a mysterious entity known as the Dungeon Master, they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous Venger and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home.\nLiving long before the mid-to-late 14 century DR, she was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat, together with their miniature unicorn. By 1369 DR, the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla, Amn, displayed paintings of her two friends, Hank and Bobby.\nIn the 1360s DR, Diana and her friends visited the town of Shadowdale in Faer√ªn so that Presto could ask the great sage Elminster to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the Old Skull Inn, they spotted Elminster, and though Eric dismissed him as old, Diana thought he looked pretty good for his age and warned that \"wizards have ears like a fox.\" When Presto lost his nerve, the kind monk reassured the wizard that he did not have to. Yet she stood beside him to declare his suitability to Elminster.\nThus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.\nAt this time, now an adult, the monk looked very similar but was very muscled. Diana kept similar apparel, from her top and shorts to her armband to her circlet. She still carried a staff.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Diana and her friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the High Sun Games hosted by Lord Forge Fitzwilliam in the newly built arena in Neverwinter. They evaded the displacer beast and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina used the horn of beckoning death above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.After reaching the cage, the cartoon characters are not seen again. The beckoning death smoke later engulfs their position in the arena, but it is likely they left before this. Their purpose for competing is also unknown, but they may also have been trying to stop Forge and Sofina.\nAged only 14, Diana and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried potatoes they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth he had a new plan, but Diana and the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then driders and darkmantles ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious portal that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of Waterdeep, now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked."
