        "History": "Orne spent almost two decades on the run from Harpers' justice. Those Who Harp chaced the villain across ten nations and over a thousand miles. The necromancer switched three bodies, but Harpers brought the villain down in the end. Harpers recovered numerous evil and deadly [[enchanted]] items from him, including ''[[The Black Satchel‎]]''. The artifacts were stored in secret secure vaults across the lands to keep them from wrong hands."
