Knucklebone was a female rock gnome wizard, a self proclaimed mistress of the magical arts, and an adventurer in the 14 century DR.
The red-headed gnomish woman had bad skin and was quite eccentric, often prone to fits of cackling.
In the 14 century DR, several adventurers were summoned to aid the Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson in dealing with the recent increase in crime and monster activity pouring out of Undermountain.
Knucklebone camped out at the Golden Hammer Inn that had direct access to the city sewers, teeming with kobolds and the undead of the Albrik Army. She offered to join a small group of heroes personally assembled by Piergeiron to stop the sinister alliance of enemies of Waterdeep.
