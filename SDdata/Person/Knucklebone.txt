'''Knucklebone''' was a female [[rock gnome]] [[wizard]], a self proclaimed mistress of the [[magic]]al arts, and an adventurer in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The red-headed gnomish woman had bad skin and was quite eccentric, often prone to fits of cackling.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several adventurers were summoned to aid the [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] in dealing with the recent increase in crime and monster activity pouring out of [[Undermountain]].

Knucklebone camped out at the [[Golden Hammer Inn]] that had direct access to [[Waterdeep/Sewers|the city sewers]], teeming with [[kobold]]s and the [[undead]] of the [[Albrik Army]]. She offered to join a small group of heroes personally assembled by Piergeiron to stop the sinister alliance of enemies of Waterdeep.
