Ahlrik Halfblood was a treasure-obsessed half-elven adventurer, active in the 14 century DR.
Ahlriks beautiful face, the product of her half-elven blood, hid her cold nature. The only thing she cared about was collecting treasure and valuable works of art. She had no friends, while the closest personal connections of the half-elf were those hired to guard Ahlriks collection.
Ahlrik Halfblood was born in a humble town along the Deepwashâ€”Shalane in Erlkazar. She quickly developed expensive tastes and dedicated her life to acquiring things of great value. Despite the accumulated collection, Ahlrik did not have extra money and could not afford to hire adventurers, instead, she used her skills of a mage and a fighter to retrieve treasures personally.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, Ahlrik Halfblood was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.
