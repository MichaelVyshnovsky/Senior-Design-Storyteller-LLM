Gershom was a human ranger who accidentally fell into another plane.It is unclear whether Gershom was originally from Toril and found himself transported somewhere more primitive, or if he was from a more developed world and traveled to Toril.
Gershom had long and ragged white hair, with a matching mustache. He wore fringed leather clothing, and carried a black sword with a red pommel.
Aside from his mundane leather armor and backpack, Gershom owned several magical items a longsword of sharpness, a ring of protection, a girdle of frost giant strength, and a gem of seeing.
Whilst on a solitary wilderness trek, Gershom fell into a seemingly bottomless hole. After falling for several hours, he landed in a pond. Upon exploring his surroundings, he ascertained that he had accidentally traveled to a less developed plane of existence.
