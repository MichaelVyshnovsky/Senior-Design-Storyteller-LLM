        "mainbody": "'''Odelinde''' was a [[guardian naga]] who served as a [[priestess]] and the guardian of [[Windrider Glade]]'s temple of [[Shaundakul]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''I was hunting in the ruins - the [[lizardfolk]] are fat this time of year. When I returned, the [[orc]] filth had overrun the shrine. They raised an idol to [[Gruumsh]] on my Lord's altar frolicked before it!''|Odelinde the Golden Serpent}}",
        "Personality": "Despite her [[naga]] nature and habits of treating orcs and most other [[humanoids]] as food, she honored her deity, who was known as the benefactor for adventurers and was ready to offer aid to any creatures of such trade.",
        "Abilities": "Apart from regular abilities of guardian nagas and arcane magic, Odelinde possessed the divine gifts of a cleric of Shaundakul.",
        "History": "[[File:Idol of Gruumsh.png|thumb|''Corrupting idol of [[Gruumsh]] in [[Windrider Glade]].''|260x260px]]\nBy 1369 DR, Odelinde was the last of her family that served for many generations as protectors and [[cleric]]s of the Helping Hand in his open-air shrine in Windrider Glade.\n\nOdelinde was one of the creatures mentioned in the prophetic ''[[Song of Faer√ªn]]''. Her aid was essential for the successes of the [[Veiled Ones]], the group of adventurers who stood against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their occupation of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR. Odelinde felt the heroes who were traveling through the ruins and confronted them the moment they stepped into the plaza of Windrider Glade. She asked for the adventurers' help to cleanse her deity's holy land off of orcs enthralled by the corrupted magic of the ''[[pool of radiance]]''. The power of a ''spawn pool'' latched itself to an idol worshiped by the orcs, spreading its dominating but empowering energies. The orcs overpowered Odelinde, forcing her to flee.\n\nThe Veiled Ones agreed to aid the naga, guided by [[Caalenfaire]]'s prophecy. After a fierce battle, the heroes smashed the defeated orcs' idol, causing the corrupted ''spawn pool'' to drain. Grateful, Odelinde used her healing magic to help the adventurers on their quest, as well as provided them with invaluable information on ways of getting into Castle Cormanthor, seized by the Cult and the corruption of Myth Drannor's ''[[mythal]]''."
