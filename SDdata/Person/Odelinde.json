        "mainbody": "Odelinde was a guardian naga who served as a priestess and the guardian of Windrider Glades temple of Shaundakul circa 1369 DR.\nDespite her naga nature and habits of treating orcs and most other humanoids as food, she honored her deity, who was known as the benefactor for adventurers and was ready to offer aid to any creatures of such trade.\nApart from regular abilities of guardian nagas and arcane magic, Odelinde possessed the divine gifts of a cleric of Shaundakul.\nthumb|Corrupting idol of 260x260px\nBy 1369 DR, Odelinde was the last of her family that served for many generations as protectors and clerics of the Helping Hand in his open-air shrine in Windrider Glade.\nOdelinde was one of the creatures mentioned in the prophetic Song of Faer√ªn. Her aid was essential for the successes of the Veiled Ones, the group of adventurers who stood against the Cult of the Dragon and their occupation of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR. Odelinde felt the heroes who were traveling through the ruins and confronted them the moment they stepped into the plaza of Windrider Glade. She asked for the adventurers help to cleanse her deitys holy land off of orcs enthralled by the corrupted magic of the pool of radiance. The power of a spawn pool latched itself to an idol worshiped by the orcs, spreading its dominating but empowering energies. The orcs overpowered Odelinde, forcing her to flee.\nThe Veiled Ones agreed to aid the naga, guided by Caalenfaires prophecy. After a fierce battle, the heroes smashed the defeated orcs idol, causing the corrupted spawn pool to drain. Grateful, Odelinde used her healing magic to help the adventurers on their quest, as well as provided them with invaluable information on ways of getting into Castle Cormanthor, seized by the Cult and the corruption of Myth Drannors mythal."
