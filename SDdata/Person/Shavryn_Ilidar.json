        "mainbody": "'''Shavryn Ilidar''', known as '''Ilidar the Brave''' and the '''Healer of the High Roads''', was a famed itinerant healer and a high priest of [[Ilmater]] at a temple in [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the 7{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|26}}<ref group=\"note\">By the phrasing of the text and the date of his book, Ilidar is implied to have lived a long time ago, in the mid-600s DR. However, he is also said to be currently a high priest in Arrabar. The reason for his unusual longevity is unknown.\n{{quote|\nAdventures are things farmers and craftsmen have little time for, and merchants can spare few coins toward. That leaves adventure to those unwilling souls who have it thrust upon them—sometimes literally, and to the thugs and fools who enjoy violence and danger or know no other way to feed themselves.\n\nThere are a lot of those, so we have large armies, and lots of bloody adventure. A good thing too—else what would the farmers, craftsmen, and merchants have to talk about, in the taverns at night?|Shavryn Ilidar, ''Life on the Rack''}}",
        "Activities": "In his travels around the Realms, Ilidar generously offered healing, food, and money to needy folks he met along the way. He seemed to have a habit of always passing by just when injured [[adventurer]]s were most in need of aid, and this reputation lasted long into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] in the lands around the [[Dragon Reach]] and on the [[Sword Coast|Northern Sword Coast]].\n\nBy the late 1350s DR, however, Ilidar was elderly and had settled down to managed a large and influential temple in Arrabar.",
        "Works": "Ilidar wrote of his journeys in a [[chapbook]] titled ''[[Life on the Rack]]'', written in the {{YearlinkName|650}}.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}"
