He would not do this for the malevolent or false, however.\nHe was the master of Lordan the Pure, and would have a place of succor and healing for him as long as Lordan remained in good standing with their shared beliefs.\nFarrish had built the Temple of Lathander in Freedale on his own, over the years."
