Dawsom () was a servant in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Dawsom had always served House Culkin. However, having grown resentful of his familys legacy and wishing for something more, he agreed to spy on his mistress and her dealings with the Lords Alliance, acting under orders of the Hawks. Despite this, he loved Zora like a daughter.
Dawsom normally was very cordial but with his secret he had a note of suspicion and unease in his voice.
Dawsom was the old servant of House Culkin, serving under Zora Rosealine Culkin.
