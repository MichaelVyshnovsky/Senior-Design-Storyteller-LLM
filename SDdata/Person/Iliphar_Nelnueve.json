        "mainbody": "Iliphar Nelnueve, known as Lord of the Scepters, was an elven warrior-mage.\nIliphar had long silver-blond hair, constrained by a circlet with three spikes and an inset amethyst. He has a scar from one temple to his chin, inflicted in combat with the ancient black dragon Thauglor.\nIn the , Iliphar dared to make camp in the Land of the Purple Dragon now known as Cormyr. He was spotted by Thauglor, who ruled said land, but respectfully retreated, in awe of the great dragons speed and grace.\nIliphars powers in battle earned him the respect of the elven House Amaratharr after defeating the dragonkin of Thauglor on numerous occasions. In the , Iliphar and a small group of elves met with Thauglor and his two young witnesses, the blue Gloriankithsanus and red Mistinarperadnacles, in a parley.\nIn the , Iliphar brought his elven court to the settlement of Suzail and organized the coronation of Faerlthann Obarskyr, the first king of Cormyr. He appointed Baerauble Etharr as the advisor to the crown.\nThe date of Iliphars death is not known but he died sometime before 900 DR.\nIliphar had a quick wit and came across as fearless.\nIliphar carried a golden staff twisted so it appeared like rope. It was topped by a purple stone carved into the shape of a bird. He wore a sash of various wands in individual sheaths ready for combat."
