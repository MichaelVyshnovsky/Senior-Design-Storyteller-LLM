        "mainbody": "'''Iliphar Nelnueve''', known as Lord of the Scepters, was an elven warrior-mage.",
        "Appearance": "Iliphar had long silver-blond hair, constrained by a circlet with three spikes and an inset [[amethyst]]. He has a scar from one temple to his chin, inflicted in combat with the ancient [[black dragon]] [[Thauglor]].",
        "Background": "In the {{YearlinkName|-400}}, Iliphar dared to make camp in the Land of the Purple Dragon; now known as [[Cormyr]]. He was spotted by Thauglor, who ruled said land, but respectfully retreated, in awe of the great dragon's speed and grace.\n\nIliphar's powers in battle earned him the respect of the elven [[House Amaratharr]] after defeating the dragonkin of Thauglor on numerous occasions. In the {{YearlinkName|-205}}, Iliphar and a small group of elves met with Thauglor and his two young witnesses, the [[blue dragon|blue]] [[Gloriankithsanus]] and [[red dragon|red]] [[Mistinarperadnacles]], in a parley.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|26}}, Iliphar brought his elven court to the settlement of [[Suzail]] and organized the coronation of [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]], the first king of [[Cormyr]]. He appointed [[Baerauble Etharr]] as the advisor to the crown.\n\nThe date of Iliphar's death is not known but he died sometime before [[900 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Iliphar had a quick wit and came across as fearless.",
        "Possessions": "Iliphar carried a golden staff twisted so it appeared like rope. It was topped by a purple stone carved into the shape of a bird. He wore a sash of various wands in individual sheaths ready for combat."
