        "mainbody": "'''Relve Turcassan''' was a warlord that helped the [[Obarskyr]]s forge the new kingdom of [[Cormyr]]",
        "Description": "Relve was a relatively short man with long black hair and a tightly trimmed beard and mustache. He had pale eyes (described as hazel to mauve) and a confident smile that gave him a feline-like appearance.",
        "Personality": "Relve was always cool under pressure and rarely ever lost his temper. He avoided getting involved in petty squabbles between members of the rank and file and did not indulge in brawling or excessive drinking.",
        "Abilities": "He was a battle-proven tactician with an eye for detail that prevented small problems from becoming big ones. He was one of the most successful warlords in early Cormyrean history, earning that distinction through meritorious deeds, not by wealth or influence.",
        "Relationships": "Relve and fellow war leader [[Orndar Oulamn Merendil|Orndar Merendil]] both became lifelong enemies of [[Belmer Oelber Rayburton|Belmer Rayburton]] when they confronted him about giving financial support to the forces trying to keep newly formed Cormyr together as it was besieged by monsters, pirates, and bandits.{{Cite dragon/278/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr|90}}",
        "History": "Why Relve and Orndar approached the miserly Belmer Rayburton has been lost to history, but the famous explorer and revealer of secrets, [[Volothamp Geddarm]], speculated that they somehow knew or suspected that Belmer had a hidden source of wealth. Belmer was outraged at the effrontery and privately fearful that his greatest secret—the existence of the [[Rayburton Jewels]]—would be exposed, so he attacked without mercy, intending to silence them forever. Both Relve and Orndar were wounded in the fight and some of the warriors under their command were killed. Belmer was also wounded and two of his armsmen died as well. Belmer's younger brother [[Onkyl Drethan Rayburton|Onkyl]] put an end to the public fighting when he threatened to reveal Belmer's secret. But from that day forward, Relve and Orndar were hounded by unknown attackers that occasionally came by night to harass or kill the two warlords. The [[Turcassan]] and [[Merendil]] families believed that the assailants were hired by Belmer."
