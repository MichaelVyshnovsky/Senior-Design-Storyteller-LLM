'''Shander''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and co-owner of [[Transgate Industries]], who lived in [[Karsus Enclave]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
After the death of his parents [[Ocelot (Netherese)|Ocelot]] and [[Ytartia]], Shander operated Transgate Industries alongside his siblings [[Acciajuoli]] and [[Thamer]]. They proceeded to do extremely well in managing it, and greatly increased the success of the company in the following years.
