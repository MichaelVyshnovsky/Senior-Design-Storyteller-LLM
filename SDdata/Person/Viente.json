        "mainbody": "'''Viente''' was a [[Halruaa]]n traveling entertainer, member of [[Troupe Gioviente]], and the partner of [[Gio]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Viente and his partner Gio spent many years traveling across Halruaa, entertaining locals with acts of music and \"magic.\" for several years before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Troupe Gioviente took in a young mage on the run, [[Tzigone]], who later in life would be known as the hero of the [[Battle of Akhlaur's Swamp]]. The loving duo was the closest thing to a family the young woman had. By the spring of 1370 DR, Tzigone parted ways with the Troupe. That spring, Viente, along with the traveling company, performed in the city of [[Khaerbaal]] and were ready to head to [[Sulazir]] for a while. They were delayed by the youngest addition to the Troupe - young troublemaker [[Carmelo]], whose antics always attracted the attention of Halruaan [[Inquisitor (Halruaa)|Inquisitor]]s. Carmelo was thrown into Khaerbaal's hold, delaying the group's departure."
