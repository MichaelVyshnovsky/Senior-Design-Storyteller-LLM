Jedren Hiller was a the Bailiff of the Wide in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
He was a wholly corrupt man who fully expected to be offered bribes, which he readily accepted.
While he carried out his normal duties as bailiff, Hiller gave preferential market space to nobles of the Upper City, and those who offered more generous inducements.
