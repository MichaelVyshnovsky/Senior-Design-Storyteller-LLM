He had a bastard half-elven son named Kymer and a son through marriage named Coram.\nBesides Kymers mother, Alemander was also rumored to have had an affair with his court vizera Wyvorlaa. Regardless of the truth of the rumors, she indeed influenced his rule more than his own dukes and chancellors.\nAlemander was born in 1150 DR and was crowned king in the Year of the Shieldtree, 1181 DR.\nIn 1188 DR, Alemanders vizera Wyvorlaa was accused of consorting with a lich living beneath the Starspire Mountains. The kings nobles pressured him to order her execution, and he at last consented.\nAlemander died in 1202 DR Coram, his firstborn legitimate son, succeeded him as Coram IV."
