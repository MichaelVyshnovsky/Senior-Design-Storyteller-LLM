Devout '''Wasp''' was a [[goblin]] raider and follower of [[the Absolute]] that dwelled within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You ain't hear? We sacked Waukeen's Rest and left it to burn. Drow flingin' matic, gnolls nsappin' off heads. Inn's nothing' but a pile of ash by now.|Druk.}}

==Abilities==
Wasp was among the goblins granted the ''[[mark of the Absolute]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Wasp and other goblins from the Shattered Sanctum launched a savage raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, which was situated along the [[Risen Road]]. They managed to kill many [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers and capture some [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|Baldurian nobles]], including as Wasp put it, [[Ulder Ravengard|"some duke"]], all of whom were taken to [[Moonrise Towers]].
