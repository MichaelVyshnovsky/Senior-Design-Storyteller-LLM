        "mainbody": "'''Saura Umakra''' was a [[Red Wizard]], and apprentice of [[Nusair Darkul]]. In [[Hammer]] of {{yearlink|1372}}, she recovered the '' [[the Scalamagdrion|Scalamagdrion]]'' and used it to kill her master, inheriting his red robes.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|154}}",
        "Description": "Saura bore a dragon's claw tattoo encircling her left eye, which glowed at the touch of her master, and an intrincate tattoo on her throat.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|143-144}}",
        "Personality": "Saura was ambitious and ruthless, apprenticing herself to the repellent and lecherous Nusair Darkul in order to become a Red Wizard. She also was treacherous, eventually setting a trap for her master so as to inherit his robes with the blessing of his enemy.",
        "Abilities": "Saura could employ ''[[light]]''. In contrast to her apparently meager magical ability, she was able to master the ''Scalamagdrion'' within the space of three days.",
        "Possessions": "Saura carried a serrated [[dirk]]. She also had her master's robes, and eventually, ''the Scalamagdrion''.",
        "Activities": "Saura was her master's lover as well as apprentice, though she detested it.",
        "Relationships": "Saura Umakra was Nusair Darkul's apprentice and lover, knowing him best of all people in Thay.",
        "History": "In mid-Hammer of 1372, Nusair Darkul sent her to [[Skuld]], where she was to retrieve ''the Scalamagdrion'' from a private collection. In return, he promised to sponsor her as a Red Wizard.\n\nWhile in Skuld, she spent two days surveiling the bookstore where her target was kept, and then broke in at night. She was caught by the proprietor, [[Mephnit Nandem]], who told her that he had summoned the Guard; she tried to negotiate, but after realizing it was not going to happen quickly enough, she simply slew him and took the book.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|147-148}}\n\nThree days later, she returned to [[Darkul Tower]]. She was, however, passed up for promotion.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|149}} Unknown to him, however, before Nusair Darkul's final reneging on sponsoring her as a red wizard, Saura had learned how to control ''the Scalamagdrion''', and used it to kill the red wizard. She intended to reach out to Samas Kul afterwards for her sponsoring.The text is ambiguous on the timing of Samas Kul's involvement; the tense suggests that she may have already reached out, but it could also be worded as a desiderative (a hope or wishing out loud) on her part."
