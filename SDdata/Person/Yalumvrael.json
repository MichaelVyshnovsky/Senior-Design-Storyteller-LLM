        "History": "He ambushed [[Alvaerele Tasundrym]] in the [[High Dale]] while she was picking [[mistflowers]]. Pretending to be sick, he lured her close enough that he could spit acid at her face; her response was quick enough nonetheless, and she used a number of spells to turn the acid into water, make it an endless stream, and then turn him to stone, converting him into the statue of [[Wizardgout Water]].\n\nLater, his petrified body was buried under a landslide, hiding the source of the stream."
