Pretending to be sick, he lured her close enough that he could spit acid at her face her response was quick enough nonetheless, and she used a number of spells to turn the acid into water, make it an endless stream, and then turn him to stone, converting him into the statue of Wizardgout Water.\nLater, his petrified body was buried under a landslide, hiding the source of the stream."
