'''Mikreava''' was a sentinel [[gargoyle]] in service to the [[Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar]] who rebelled against its handlers in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Mikreava arrived in the [[Undermountain]] temple of the dead deity [[Myrkul]] alongside the [[Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar]] in their attempt to take over and claim the worship site as their own in [[1370 DR]]. During that time, Mikreava decided against following the Knights and Grumbar and became more interested in consuming [[humanoid]] flesh. The gargoyle fled and made a lair in the bedchambers of the former High Priest of Myrkul. Subsequently, an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] arrived at the temple in search of the well-hidden ''[[Black Wand of Myrkul]]''. There he met [[Chasbar]], a member of the Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar. Eventually, both Mikreava and Chasbar asked the adventurer to slay one another. Regardless of the hero's decision, the gargoyle's patience ran thin and it decided to find out how the adventurer tasted.
