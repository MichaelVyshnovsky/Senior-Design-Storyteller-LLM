Gaspar was a fishmonger who lived in Easthaven within the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
The fishmonger was of normal build and dressed grey clothing.
Gaspar sold knucklehead trout to be used by scrimshawers from his warehouse with the help of Churin. 
He had a son, Damien who liked to fish on the banks of Lac Dinneshere.
During Eleint, 1281 DR, Gaspar ordered supplies from Ilmus Gallaway to aid Easthaven in the coming winter, but the caravan from Caer-Dineval was ambushed by orc raiders lead by an ogre.
