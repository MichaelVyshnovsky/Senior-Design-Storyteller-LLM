'''Tanerieh''' was the innkeeper of [[Leira's Trick]] in the [[Openpalm Bazar]] district of [[Samargol]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

{{quote|''Isn't the goddess [[Leira]] dead? Ay, that is what some say. But are not her guises [[illusion]]s? And as illusions remain,
does not she? Would it not suit her so to pretend she was gone? And what if Leira was never Leira but someone else? What if she was someone else, and is Leira now? Questions cover questions, gentle, we will never know the truth. We must be pleased with the illusion.''|Tanerieh}}

==Description==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Tanerieh was an older woman with a noticeably unfocused look on her face. Despite her almost trance-like state, she managed to keep an attentive eye on the entire inn.

==Personality==
Tanerieh was a devote worshiper of the Mistress of Illusions, Leira. Despite the goddess being believed dead by some, Tanerieh was convinced that the goddess of lies and illusions simply made it appear so to the inhabitants of [[Faer√ªn]]. She considered [[druid]]s and their strange rituals quite peculiar.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Tanerieh opened Leira's Trick's doors to a group of adventurers who survived the shipwreck of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilat]]'' and became hirelings for the local merchant named [[Sa'Sani]]. Many many others in her trade, Tanerieh knew all the latest rumors, including recent [[dinosaur]] unrest on the edges of [[Samarlogh]], whispers from those touched by magics that a calamity was looming over the the Coast of Swords, and a [[One of Many|strange evil]] that arrived from another land that haunted the jungles.
