Tanerieh was the innkeeper of Leiras Trick in the Openpalm Bazar district of Samargol circa 1374 DR.
In the late 14 century DR, Tanerieh was an older woman with a noticeably unfocused look on her face. Despite her almost trance-like state, she managed to keep an attentive eye on the entire inn.
Tanerieh was a devote worshiper of the Mistress of Illusions, Leira. Despite the goddess being believed dead by some, Tanerieh was convinced that the goddess of lies and illusions simply made it appear so to the inhabitants of Faer√ªn. She considered druids and their strange rituals quite peculiar.
In the , Tanerieh opened Leiras Tricks doors to a group of adventurers who survived the shipwreck of the Vigilat and became hirelings for the local merchant named SaSani. Many many others in her trade, Tanerieh knew all the latest rumors, including recent dinosaur unrest on the edges of Samarlogh, whispers from those touched by magics that a calamity was looming over the the Coast of Swords, and a strange evil that arrived from another land that haunted the jungles.
