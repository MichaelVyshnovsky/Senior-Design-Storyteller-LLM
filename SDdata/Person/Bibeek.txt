'''Bibeek''' was a musician inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] who died some years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bibeek died sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1486}} and was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]]. His gravestone was etched with a praise to [[Oghma]], and the musicians songs. The inscription read: "Bibeek, favoured of Oghma. Your songs live on in the streets and in our hearts." The musician's grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and the body risen as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.
