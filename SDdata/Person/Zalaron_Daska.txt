Zalaron was one of the leaders of the town when it was attacked by a marauding party of twenty frost giants, who arrived in a frost giant greatship.
Along with the other members of the ruling triumvirate, Zalaron was known to accept bribes, exchanging ore and coin for more and better supplies, whose distribution they controlled.
