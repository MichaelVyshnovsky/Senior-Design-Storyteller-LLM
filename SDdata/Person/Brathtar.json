He was to pass it to the next keeper of the Inner Bastion. The knight Telarian often joined him and the captains for dice games and white wine, which the commander imported from SildÃ«yuir at great cost. They once explored the Underdungeon beneath Stardeep, where Brathtar had saved Telarians life from some revived fossils and then ordered the entrances closed.\nOn , after Midwinter, Brathtar received orders from Keeper Telarian to eliminate an elven encampment that had wandered too close to Stardeeps entrance. Though he agreed to the task, he left a letter for Delphe, asking her to meet with him at her earliest opportunity.\nAfter they began receiving retaliation from the Masters of the Yuirwood, Brathtar was ordered by Telarian to hide all signs of fight after he failed at that task, Telarian judged him a traitor. When Brathtar began to question Telarians orders again, the Keeper slew him on the spot with Nis."
