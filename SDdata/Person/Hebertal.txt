Hebertal the Hunched was a human bard, sage, and fortune teller, living in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR.
As his unfortunate nickname indicated, Hebertal was marked by a hunch on his back.
To counteract his appearance, Hebertal was highly charming and even suave in manner. He also quite flirtatious with females of any species.
As a bard, he was skilled in performance in the art of fortune telling, as well deception and persuasion.
For his services as a sage, circa 1372 DR, he charged 15 gp to answer a significant question, but took a day to provide a result. His research and discussions were often interrupted by his other trade as a fortune teller, as he regularly took in clients during the day and constantly tried to persuade those employing him as a sage to have him read their fortunes. He favored the use of talis cards.
