'''Hebertal the Hunched''' was a [[human]] [[bard]], sage, and fortune teller, living in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As his unfortunate nickname indicated, Hebertal was marked by a hunch on his back.

==Personality==
To counteract his appearance, Hebertal was highly charming and even suave in manner. He also quite flirtatious with females of any species.

==Abilities==
As a bard, he was skilled in performance in the art of fortune telling, as well deception and persuasion.

==Activities==
For his services as a sage, ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], he charged 15 [[gp]] to answer a significant question, but took a day to provide a result. His research and discussions were often interrupted by his other trade as a fortune teller, as he regularly took in clients during the day and constantly tried to persuade those employing him as a sage to have him read their fortunes. He favored the use of [[talis]] cards.
