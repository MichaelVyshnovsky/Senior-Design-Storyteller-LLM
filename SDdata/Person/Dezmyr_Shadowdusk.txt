'''Dezmyr Shadowdusk''' was a former [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] and later [[death knight]] and joint matriarch of House [[Shadowdusk]].

==History==
Dezmyr and her brother [[Zalthar Shadowdusk|Zalthar]] were born to [[Yarlithra Shadowdusk]], one of the three original sisters who made the family's fortune by funding adventuring expeditions into [[Undermountain]].

Unfortunately, the family came into possession of an object, a tablet of black crystal that allowed contact with the [[Far Realm]]. It soon spread madness through the entire family.

Later, in the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, [[Shadowdusk Hold (original)|Shadowdusk Hold]], their ancestral home, was burned to the ground, killing Yarlithra and her sisters. Soon afterwards, Dezmyr and her brother were contacted by their uncle [[Xerrion Shadowdusk]], who invited them to come to the new [[Shadowdusk Hold]] in Undermountain.

Years later, after Dezmyr had shed her faith to [[Torm]], Xerrion and his wife [[Margaraste Shadowdusk|Margaraste]] journeyed into the Far Realm together, and were never seen again. As a result, Dezmyr and Zalthar became the new heads of the House.

==Abilities==
Dezmyr was a powerful spellcaster. Additionally, she possessed the endless life that death knights were given. Although some death knights could one day die by repenting, Dezmyr had gone mad too long ago for this to work.
