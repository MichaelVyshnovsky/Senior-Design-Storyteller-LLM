Eaergladden Moondark was a member of the Moondark family of Westgate in the 8 century DR.
He was not a mage.
By the end of his life, Eaergladden Moondark was destitute.
He had been reduced to begging his kin for money to buy food with, implying he was on far from the best of terms with them.
In the , Elminster Aumar planted an enchanted wand, an everbright glowing dagger, scrolls, and a spellbook in Eaergladdens casket at the Crypt of the Moondark.
As Elminster shoved magic devices in his casket, he called him "Master Mage of the Moondarks", strongly implying he was about to spread a rumor that Eaergladden was a sorcerer of sorts.
