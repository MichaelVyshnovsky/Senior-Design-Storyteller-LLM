Nusazto Ichi was a human barbarian of the Warring States in Kara-Tur and later a guest of the imperial court of Tu Lung in the capital city Wai around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR).
Nusazto was the son of a general whod been captured by the forces of Tu Lung, Nusazto was brought to the imperial court, where he was mostly viewed as a crude barbarian. However, Emperor Wai Gada Shinzu was amused by his unrefined behavior and clumsy efforts in court pageantry, and mostly kept him on to irritate his mother.
Nusazto was constantly scheming to assassinate the emperor, and was said to be waiting for the ideal moment to strike. However, when his co-conspirators were exposed, he invariably turned states evidence to save his own neck while they lost theirs. Ironically, he revealed many assassination plots in this way and thus earned the favor of the Emperor and his family. Although his hatred of Tu Lung and its people was well known, some rumored this was feigned and he engaged in these antics to amuse and remain at court, where he enjoyed better living than he ever would at home.
The ladies of the court were drawn to this exotic barbarian, while the men had their masculine honor offended. Two of them challenged Nusazto to a duel and he slew them without mercy.
Nusazto was a conceited and treacherous figure, quick to anger and unsophisticated in the ways of the court. He engaged in elaborate schemes to seek revenge for a slight and was a murderer. He wore his native dress with pride.
