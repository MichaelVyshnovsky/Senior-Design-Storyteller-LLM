'''Nu'sazto Ichi''' was a [[human]] [[barbarian]] of the [[Warring States]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and later a guest of the imperial court of [[T'u Lung]] in the capital city [[Wai]] around [[1357 DR|Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR)]].

==History==
Nu'sazto was the son of a general who'd been captured by the forces of T'u Lung, Nu'sazto was brought to the imperial court, where he was mostly viewed as a crude barbarian. However, Emperor [[Wai Gada Shinzu]] was amused by his unrefined behavior and clumsy efforts in court pageantry, and mostly kept him on to irritate [[Wai Locunni Eio|his mother]].

==Activities==
Nu'sazto was constantly scheming to assassinate the emperor, and was said to be waiting for the ideal moment to strike. However, when his co-conspirators were exposed, he invariably turned state's evidence to save his own neck while they lost theirs. Ironically, he revealed many assassination plots in this way and thus earned the favor of the Emperor and [[Wai clan|his family]]. Although his hatred of T'u Lung and its people was well known, some rumored this was feigned and he engaged in these antics to amuse and remain at court, where he enjoyed better living than he ever would at home.

The ladies of the court were drawn to this exotic barbarian, while the men had their masculine honor offended. Two of them challenged Nu'sazto to a duel and he slew them without mercy.

==Personality==
Nu'sazto was a conceited and treacherous figure, quick to anger and unsophisticated in the ways of the court. He engaged in elaborate schemes to seek revenge for a slight and was a murderer. He wore his native dress with pride.
