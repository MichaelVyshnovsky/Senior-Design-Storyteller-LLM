        "mainbody": "Orpheus, titled the Prince of the Comet and the True Heir, was a githyanki monk purported to be the true ruler of the githyanki people in the late 15 century DR.\nAccording to inscribed discs banned by the followers of Vlaakith and found hidden in the Arcane Tower and Cr√®che Yllek, Orpheus was the son of Gith, the leader of the rebellion that freed the race that would bear her name from slavery to the mind flayers. Later, learning of how Vlaakith I betrayed Gith and sacrificed her to Tiamat, Orpheus led Giths Honor Guard in a revolt and named himself the rightful king of the githyanki, triggering the War of the Comet. At the head of the Honor Guard mounted on red dragons, Orpheus bravely fought Vlaakiths knights in a battle in the Astral Plane, where he praised Gith and accused Vlaakith. Yet he was overcome and defeated, lost in the fiery dragon breath of the red ridden by Kithrak Voss, and was thought dead.\nHowever, Orpheus was spared by Vlaakith and was held captive in a pocket of the Astral Plane that could only be accessed by the Astral Prism, bound with infernal chains that could only be broken by the Orphic Hammer. His Honor Guard remained at his side out of duty as Vlaakith covered up his existence, hoping to one day steal his powers from him while spreading propaganda that Orpheus was a jealous pretender to the throne. Orpheus imprisonment was only known to Voss, Vlaakith and her descendants, and secret sect of loyal devotees keeping his name alive through githyanki society.\nIn 1492 DR, Year of the Three Ships Sailing, the elder brain known as the Absolute secretly fed information about the Astral Prism to the Chosen of the Dead Three as part of a calculated plan to escape their control. Out of fear of what Orpheus powers could do to disrupt their plans, Enver Gortash sent several enthralled illithids in search of the Prism. One such illithid known as the Emperor discovered the Prism first and inadvertently regained its free will. The Emperor then went inside the Prism and discovered Orpheus and proceeded to mentally dominate him to leverage his powers to protect several tadpoled adventurers it directed to oppose the Dead Three and the Absolute.\nThe githyanki male had a beard and weighed . He wore crimson, purple, and silver attire.\nLike all githyanki, Orpheus harbored a deep hatred of mind flayers. However, he was wise enough to put the liberation of his people first even if meant making certain compromises.\nPossessing powers similar to those of his mother, Gith, Orpheus was able to disrupt the illithids hivemind and psionic powers, allowing him to prevent others from becoming illithids by blocking the transformation commands from the Absolute to its modified tadpoles."
