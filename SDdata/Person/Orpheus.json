        "mainbody": "'''Orpheus''', titled the Prince of the Comet and the True Heir, was a [[githyanki]] [[monk]] purported to be the true ruler of the githyanki people in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|Praise be to my mother Gith, the Queen of the One Sky, sacrificed to the Hells by the renegade Vlaakith!|Orpheus, in ancient battle.}}",
        "History": "According to inscribed discs banned by the followers of Vlaakith and found hidden in the [[Arcane Tower]] and [[Cr√®che Y'llek]], Orpheus was the son of [[Gith]], the leader of the rebellion that freed the [[Gith (race)|race that would bear her name]] from slavery to the [[mind flayer]]s. Later, learning of how [[Vlaakith I]] betrayed Gith and sacrificed her to [[Tiamat]], Orpheus led Gith's Honor Guard in a revolt and named himself the rightful king of the githyanki, triggering the [[War of the Comet]]. At the head of the Honor Guard mounted on [[red dragon]]s, Orpheus bravely fought Vlaakith's knights in a battle in the [[Astral Plane]], where he praised Gith and accused Vlaakith. Yet he was overcome and defeated, lost in the fiery [[dragon breath]] of the red ridden by [[Githyanki#Combat|''Kith'rak'']] [[Voss]], and was thought dead.\n\nHowever, Orpheus was spared by Vlaakith and was held captive in a pocket of the Astral Plane that could only be accessed by the Astral Prism, bound with infernal chains that could only be broken by the ''[[Orphic Hammer]]''. His Honor Guard remained at his side out of duty as Vlaakith covered up his existence, hoping to one day steal his powers from him while spreading propaganda that Orpheus was a jealous pretender to the throne. Orpheus' imprisonment was only known to Voss, Vlaakith and her descendants, and secret sect of loyal devotees keeping his name alive through githyanki society.\n\nIn [[1492 DR|1492 DR, Year of the Three Ships Sailing]], the [[elder brain]] known as [[the Absolute]] secretly fed information about the [[Astral Prism]] to the [[Chosen]] of the [[Dead Three]] as part of a calculated plan to escape their control. Out of fear of what Orpheus' powers could do to disrupt their plans, [[Enver Gortash]] sent several enthralled illithids in search of the Prism. One such illithid known as [[Balduran|the Emperor]] discovered the Prism first and inadvertently regained its free will. The Emperor then went inside the Prism and discovered Orpheus and proceeded to mentally dominate him to leverage his powers to protect several tadpoled adventurers it directed to oppose the Dead Three and the Absolute.",
        "Description": "The githyanki male had a beard and weighed {{SI|165|lb|k|long=yes}}. He wore crimson, purple, and silver attire.",
        "Personality": "Like all githyanki, Orpheus harbored a deep hatred of mind flayers. However, he was wise enough to put the liberation of his people first even if meant making certain compromises.",
        "Abilities": "Possessing powers similar to those of his mother, Gith, Orpheus was able to disrupt the illithids' hivemind and [[psionic]] powers, allowing him to prevent others from becoming illithids by blocking the transformation commands from [[the Absolute]] to its modified tadpoles.",
