        "Personality": "Curran never considered himself a chosen since he had no powers. He only thought he had very good luck.",
        "History": "Curran once lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] until he casually found the treasure of a deceased relative, he won a bet, he had some investments come through, and he found a chest of jewels that someone had lost all in the same day. \nThis convinced Curran to devote himself to Tymora and relocate to [[Daggerford]].\nIn town Curran took care of the [[Fairfortune Hall]] as priest of Tymora and was in with good relations with the duke and other influential citizens.\n\nIn [[1485 DR]], he met some adventurers recruited to stop a menace to the duchy.\n\nIn [[1486 DR]], Curran was captured by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], who identified him as a [[Chosen]] of [[Tymora]], and transported him to the Doomvault dungeon for experiments. A few weeks later he was freed from his chains by the heroes of Daggerford: some of the adventurers he had met and others. Thanks to them, he returned to Daggerford."
