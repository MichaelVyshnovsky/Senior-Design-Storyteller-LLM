Gaitiyah al-Aranib was an employee of the Merchants Home in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Tun Hayal, the owner of the Merchants Home, trusted Gaitiyah with managing the affairs of the lavish carvanserai.
She was able to house several caravans under the same roof without them bickering, which was no small feat considering the boisterous nature of most caravan-masters.
