'''Horse''' was a brutal hunter that lived in [[Narfell]] as of [[1359 DR]]. He was a very cruel man that earned his name from the particular odor that clung to his body.

==Activities==
Normally, Horse disguised himself as a [[yeti]] and surprising and attacking travelers at night. During the daytime, he used hit-and-run tactics: his favorite one was to throw a [[poison]]ed [[spear]] at a foe, anchoring it to a stone or tree stump in order to dismount his foe. He developed this particularly sticky poison made from [[passawaw grass]] that he foraged.

==History==
Horse was cast out of the [[Qu'ima]] tribe because of the savage behavior he exhibited. His life was only spared because his fellow tribespeople feared he was under the possession of some malevolent spirit.
