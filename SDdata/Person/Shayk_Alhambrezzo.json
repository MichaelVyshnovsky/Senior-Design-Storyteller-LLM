        "mainbody": "Shayk Alhambrezzo was an alchemist who lived in the Savage Frontier region in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nShayk had very greasy and odorous hair, on account of a distinct pomade he used.\nIn 1358 DR, an adventurer group entered his shop and inadvertently destroyed an antique worth 50 gp. He then tasked them with bringing him as many horns, hides, and hooves as they could harvest from unicorns found in the Unicorn Run of High Forest. He offered to pay them a thousand for each horn, two hundred for each hide, and fifty for each set of hooves."
