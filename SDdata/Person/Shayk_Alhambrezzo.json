        "Description": "Shayk had very greasy and odorous hair, on account of a distinct pomade he used.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], an [[adventurer]] group entered his shop and inadvertently destroyed an antique worth 50 [[gp]]. He then tasked them with bringing him as many horns, hides, and hooves as they could harvest from [[unicorn]]s found in the [[Unicorn Run]] of [[High Forest]]. He offered to pay them a thousand for each horn, two hundred for each hide, and fifty for each set of hooves."
