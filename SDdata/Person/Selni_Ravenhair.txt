'''Selni Ravenhair''' was one of the owners of [[Jendalar's Fine Fruits]] in [[Archenbridge]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Selni was the consort and business partner of [[Alduvar Snowbrand]]. She was one of the very few people to know of Alduvar's identity as the [[Blue Sword]] of [[Archendale]], and often took care of the shop without him.
