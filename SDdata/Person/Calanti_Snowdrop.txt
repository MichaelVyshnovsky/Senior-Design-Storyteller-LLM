Fatima Asad was a language teacher at the Grand University of Huzuz in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights in 1367 DR.
Fatima was an albino with white hair, pale skin, and red eyes.
Fatima was actually just a fake identity created by the drow known as Calanti Snowdrop. Calanti was a mage from Dambrath who was sent to spy for her country to distant Zakhara. She used her magic to appear as an albino.
She wished to return to her Queen in Dambrath in possession of an imprisoned genie.
