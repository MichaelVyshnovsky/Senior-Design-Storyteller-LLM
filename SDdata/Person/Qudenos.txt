Qudenos was a red dragon, who called himself Master of Flames and Splitter of Skies, that lived its life in service to the githyanki, in the late 15 century DR.
Qudenos served as as the steed for Kithrak Voss.
He was intent on battling against Vlaakith and was not loyal to her but to the people.
He originally served the githyanki, along with other red dragons, under a pact made with the archdevil Tiamat.
In the Faer√ªnian , Voss and Qudenos, along with other githyanki knights, traveled in pursuit of an illithid nautiloid that was in possession of a powerful gith weapon. They traversed the planes from the city of Yartar on Toril on the Prime, through Cania and Avernus in the Nine Hells, and back to Toril in the region of the Sword Coast.
After beginning patrols on a stretch of the Risen Road, Qudenos incinerated a group of Flaming Fist soldiers at Vosss direction.
He knew Orpheus and anticipated a new future after the wake of the Comet. He planned to join forces in rebellion against Vlaakith with an uncountable number of fellow dragons.
