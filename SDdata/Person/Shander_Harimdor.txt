'''Shander Harimdor''' was a merchant who lived in [[Harimmon]], one of the royal keeps of the [[Sword Lands]] of [[Laerakond]], in the late years of the 15th century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point before [[1459 DR]], Shander became interested in the legend of the [[dragonheir]]s and somehow got a copy of the rare book ''[[Dragonheir Clans]]''.

In 1459 DR, knowing that the last dragonheir of [[Clan Marlserpent]], [[Jada Marlserpent|Jada]], was born in the village of [[Wandering Stones]], Shander went to the village and adopted her in order to protect her from [[dragon]]s. He raised her and cared for her as if she was his own daughter, even if Jada was a rebellious child.

When Shander died of old age, in [[1479 DR]], he left Jada the book ''Dragonheir Clans'' as her inheritance.
