Ghenni Tlabbar was the drow matron mother of House Faen Tlabbar, the fourth house of Menzoberranzan until the Silence of Lolth.
Ghenni ascended to the position of matron mother before 1372.
In that year, she was targeted by Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin as part of his bargain with House Agrach Dyrr, who wanted Ghenni dead. Nimor infiltrated the Faen Tlabbar complex and killed Ghenni and her favorite daughter, Silzet Tlabbar, who was at her mothers side at the wrong time.
