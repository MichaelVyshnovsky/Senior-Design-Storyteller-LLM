'''Ghenni Tlabbar''' was the [[drow]] [[matron mother]] of [[House Faen Tlabbar]], the fourth house of [[Menzoberranzan]] until the [[Silence of Lolth]].
==History==
Ghenni ascended to the position of matron mother before [[1372]].

In that year, she was targeted by [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] as part of his bargain with [[House Agrach Dyrr]], who wanted Ghenni dead. Nimor infiltrated the Faen Tlabbar complex and killed Ghenni and her favorite daughter, [[Sil'zet Tlabbar]], who was at her mother's side at the wrong time.
