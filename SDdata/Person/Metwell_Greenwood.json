        "mainbody": "'''Metwell Greenwood''' was a fisher from the [[Gulf of Lath]] turned [[cleric]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Metwell was born in a humble family of fishers on the Gulf of Lath of [[Lantan]]. He was a short man and the weakest of his family. As a child, Metwell spent his time hauling catch, gutting fish, and mopping the boat's deck. By the age of eighteen, he grew disgusted with [[fish]] and decided to become a priest of the god of forests [[Silvanus]]. It was an act of teenage rebellion that led him to an adventuring career, far, far away from the much-maligned smell and slime of fish.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Greenwood was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
