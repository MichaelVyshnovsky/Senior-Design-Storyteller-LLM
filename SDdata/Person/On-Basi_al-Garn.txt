On-Basi al-Garn was the Chief Scribe of the Free City of Utaqa in north Zakhara in .
On-Basis job was to write glowing reports about Caliph Agara al-Gandar that were sent to the courts of Huzuz and Qudra. He excelled at his job probably more than he should have, for his over-embellished reports of the Caliphs proficiency as a ruler resulted in an increase in demands from the greater cities.
His latest report told a false tale of the Caliphs victory over a group of yak-folk. News of this tale actually reached the ears of the wicked creatures in the World Pillar Mountains. Their response was to send several angry dao slaves to visit the Caliph in his bedroom.
