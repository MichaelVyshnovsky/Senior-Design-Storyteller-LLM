'''On-Basi al-Garn''' was the Chief Scribe of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] in [[north Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
On-Basi's job was to write glowing reports about Caliph [[Agara al-Gandar]] that were sent to the courts of [[Huzuz]] and [[Qudra]]. He excelled at his job probably more than he should have, for his over-embellished reports of the Caliph's proficiency as a ruler resulted in an increase in demands from the greater cities.

His latest report told a false tale of the Caliph's victory over a group of [[yak-folk]]. News of this tale actually reached the ears of the wicked creatures in the [[World Pillar Mountains]]. Their response was to send several angry [[dao]] slaves to visit the Caliph in his bedroom.
