'''Brossan''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] living as a hermit in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was known to [[Malark Himbruel]].

==History==
Per Malark, he lived in a hill, as a hermit, near [[Thunderstone]], as of {{yearlink|1357}}. The mage Malark gave an enchanted ring to [[Culthar]] in {{yearlink|1357}}. The ring was triggered by the name of the first [[dracolich]] Culthar had served, and would teleport him and one other person he was in contact with to Brossan's hill, though Malark was not certain Brossan would be there right then.
