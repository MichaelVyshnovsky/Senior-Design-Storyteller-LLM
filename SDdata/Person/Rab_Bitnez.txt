'''Rab Bitnez''' was the [[garlic]]-obsessed [[wizard]] from [[Liam's Hold]], who authored the ''[[101 Garlic Recipes]]'' cookbook ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|The gnome was obviously unsuitable, not only due to his gender, but also that vile stench that clings to him like a wet [[robe]].|[[Sieronius Dethick]] on taking Rab as his wife.}}

==Description==
Rab Bitnez was a short man with dark hair, his skin was tanned from countless hours of work outside.

==Possessions==
Rab owned a house in Liam's Hold that was his home and laboratory. His favorite knife was called the [[Garlic Slicer]] and it absorbed some of garlic's corrosive effect from years of vigorous use.

==History==
According to Rab's Auntie [[Ezmerelda]], his mother gave birth to the future wizard while laying in a garlic patch and that was the reason for his life-long devotion to the noble plant and popularization of its charms across the Sword Coast.

''Circa'' 1370 DR, Rab Bitnez was a minor wizard but has accomplished creating the first in Faerun [[Garlic vine|vine]] plant that bore garlic heads like fruit. That unique plant was his pride and joy. He also authored a cookbook that featured his unique recipes such as [[The Bitnez Pavlova Extraordinaire!]], [[Rab's Riotously Intense Ice Cream]], and [[Garlic Guy Pie]].

In [[1372 DR]] Rab was attacked by vampire [[Sieronius Dethick]], who was plaguing Liam's Hold, cursed with undeath. Rab survived the encounter put his complexion suffered due to blood loss, making him appear deathly pale.
