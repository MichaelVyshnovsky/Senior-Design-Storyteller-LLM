Rab Bitnez was the garlic-obsessed wizard from Liams Hold, who authored the 101 Garlic Recipes cookbook circa 1372 DR.
Rab Bitnez was a short man with dark hair, his skin was tanned from countless hours of work outside.
Rab owned a house in Liams Hold that was his home and laboratory. His favorite knife was called the Garlic Slicer and it absorbed some of garlics corrosive effect from years of vigorous use.
According to Rabs Auntie Ezmerelda, his mother gave birth to the future wizard while laying in a garlic patch and that was the reason for his life-long devotion to the noble plant and popularization of its charms across the Sword Coast.
Circa 1370 DR, Rab Bitnez was a minor wizard but has accomplished creating the first in Faerun vine plant that bore garlic heads like fruit. That unique plant was his pride and joy. He also authored a cookbook that featured his unique recipes such as The Bitnez Pavlova Extraordinaire!, Rabs Riotously Intense Ice Cream, and Garlic Guy Pie.
In 1372 DR Rab was attacked by vampire Sieronius Dethick, who was plaguing Liams Hold, cursed with undeath. Rab survived the encounter put his complexion suffered due to blood loss, making him appear deathly pale.
