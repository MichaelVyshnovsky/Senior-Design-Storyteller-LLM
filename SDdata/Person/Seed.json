        "mainbody": "'''Dawnmaster Seed''' was one of four devoted leaders of the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], who died before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and the monastery's fall to the [[githyanki]] invaders.",
        "Description": "[[Dawnmaster]] Seed's stained glass depiction showed a hooded humanoid with dark skin, a pious look, and [[Lathanderian]] garb. The depiction was shown wielding a masterfully crafted ceremonial [[hammer]] and a [[book]] adorned with Lathander's ''[[holy symbol]]''.",
        "History": "Dawnmaster Seed was among four high-ranking members of the church who were interred in the Rosymorn Monastery sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The other three were [[Welkinglory]], [[Stockhold]], and [[Vaseid]]. All four had their sarcophagi arranged around the circular stained glass mosaic that bore their likeness while atop the pedestals laid each of their ceremonial weapons – masterfully crafted [[enchanted]] ''+1'' items that were among those great works that attracted pilgrims from across [[Faerûn]], Lathanderian and members of other faiths alike. Dawnmaster Seed was known for conducting the reconsecration of the Rosymorn Monastery."
