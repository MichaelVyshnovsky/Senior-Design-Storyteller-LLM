        "mainbody": "Sossi \"Munroe\" was a kobold neer-do-well, who along with the rest of the Munroe family harassed inhabitants of Liams Hold in 1372 DR.\nSossi appeared to be an average kobold who did not look particularly intelligent.\nSossi was armed with an enchanted +1 warhammer.\nIn 1372 DR, Sossi \"Munroe,\" along with his \"family members,\" Jethro Munroe, Yage Munroe, Methro Munroe, and Fang, camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liams Hold along the Trade Way. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor Wilsey listed the help of the individual known as the Hero of Daggerford. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the Wild Pastures and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero a stronghold - a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of Bhaal, in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed."
