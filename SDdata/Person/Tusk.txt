'''Tusk''' was a [[fiendish]] [[elephant]] and the favorite pet of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] during the invasion of [[Maerimydra]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Typically outfitted in chainmail [[barding]] and metal blades along its tusks, it was an enormous war elephant. Larger than other elephants, Tusk was covered in an unusual scaly hide.

==Personality==
Fearsome and battle-hardened, Tusk could strike fear into even [[ogre]]s when it was roused to battle.

==Abilities==
Immensely strong and with fiendish resistances to ordinary weapons, the elements, and even [[magic]], Tusk was not easily overpowered. In addition, its heritage gave Tusk intellect far surpassing others of its kind, which enabled it to ably serve its master.

==Possessions==
When outfitted for war, Tusk wore [[chainmail]] barding and had wicked blades affixed to its tusks.

==Relationships==
Tusk was the companion and pet of Kurgoth Hellspawn. Although Kurgoth took great pleasure in watching Tusk fight he never hesitated to leap to Tusk's defense should the elephant be outmatched.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Tusk was part of Kurgoth Hellspawn's invasion force when the [[half-fiend]] [[fire giant]] attacked the [[drow]] city of [[Maerimydra]]. After the conquest, Kurgoth and Tusk took up residence in the [[Coliseum (Maerimydra)|Coliseum]]. There Tusk was regularly involved in battles against disobedient soldiers that Hellspawn had forced into the arena.
