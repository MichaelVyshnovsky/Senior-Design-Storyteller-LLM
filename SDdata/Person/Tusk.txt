Tusk was a fiendish elephant and the favorite pet of Kurgoth Hellspawn during the invasion of Maerimydra in 1372 DR.
Typically outfitted in chainmail barding and metal blades along its tusks, it was an enormous war elephant. Larger than other elephants, Tusk was covered in an unusual scaly hide.
Fearsome and battle-hardened, Tusk could strike fear into even ogres when it was roused to battle.
Immensely strong and with fiendish resistances to ordinary weapons, the elements, and even magic, Tusk was not easily overpowered. In addition, its heritage gave Tusk intellect far surpassing others of its kind, which enabled it to ably serve its master.
When outfitted for war, Tusk wore chainmail barding and had wicked blades affixed to its tusks.
Tusk was the companion and pet of Kurgoth Hellspawn. Although Kurgoth took great pleasure in watching Tusk fight he never hesitated to leap to Tusks defense should the elephant be outmatched.
In 1372 DR, Tusk was part of Kurgoth Hellspawns invasion force when the half-fiend fire giant attacked the drow city of Maerimydra. After the conquest, Kurgoth and Tusk took up residence in the Coliseum. There Tusk was regularly involved in battles against disobedient soldiers that Hellspawn had forced into the arena.
