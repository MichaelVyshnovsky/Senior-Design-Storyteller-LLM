Masoj Dhuunyl was a drow abjurer and the head of the College of Abjuration and one of the members of the Conclave of Sshamath in the city of Sshamath in the late 14 century DR.
In the , Qarlynd Melarn told Miverra, a priestess of Eilistraee, that Masoj enjoyed entombing his rivals deep in earth.
In the , he met with Masters Seldszar Elpragh, Urlryn Khalazza, and Qarlynd Melarn about reclaiming the kiira that was promised to him for his support in the vote but the others Masters involved him also in their plan to strip the faerzress from the drow.
Together with Qarlynds apprentices and the Masters Urlryn Khalazza and Seldszar Elpragh, he helped Qarlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonais blood into dark elves. Afterward, they all relocated to Rhymanthiin.
