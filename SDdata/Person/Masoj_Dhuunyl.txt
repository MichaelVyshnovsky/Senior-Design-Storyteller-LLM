'''Masoj Dhuunyl''' was a [[drow]] [[abjurer]] and the head of the [[College of Abjuration]] and one of the members of the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] told [[Miverra]], a priestess of [[Eilistraee]], that Masoj enjoyed entombing his rivals deep in earth.

In the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, he met with Masters [[Seldszar Elpragh]], [[Urlryn Khalazza]], and Q'arlynd Melarn about reclaiming the [[kiira (disambiguation)|''kiira'']] that was promised to him for his support in the vote but the others Masters involved him also in their plan to strip the ''[[faerzress]]'' from the drow.

Together with Q'arlynd's apprentices and the Masters [[Urlryn Khalazza]] and [[Seldszar Elpragh]], he helped Q'arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into [[dark elves]]. Afterward, they all relocated to [[Rhymanthiin]].
