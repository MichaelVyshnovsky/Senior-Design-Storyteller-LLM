        "mainbody": "Dendybar the Mottled was a wizard and the guardian of the northern spire in the Hosttower of the Arcane in the seaport city of Luskan in the mid-14 century DR.\nDendybar was once former priest of Myrkul, until one day he decided he could more effectively serve his god as a wizard.\nBeyond his spellcasting capabilities, his devotion to Myrkul allowed Dendybar to animate skeletons and zombies.\nDendybar held a deep sense of jealousy and hatred towards his fellow guild member Eldeluc, due in part to him rising quickly within their ranks with little effort."
