'''Alger Frakk''' was a master [[blacksmith]] at the [[Smithy (Phandalin)|Smithy]] in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
His apprentice was [[Maza Fieldsalder]], who grew into a strong and skilled smith under his tutelage.

==History==
Alger ran the Smithy until he passed away under suspicious circumstances in the {{YearlinkName|1495}},{{AI-time}} leaving the business to his apprentice. There were soon rumors that Maza had killed Alger, and that perhaps she had good reason to do so.
