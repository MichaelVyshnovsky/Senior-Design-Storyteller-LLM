'''Glomred''' was an [[orc]] [[shaman]] of the [[Spleen Eaters]] tribe that lived in [[Big Bone Deep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
He wore a simple hauberk of [[chainmail]].

==Relationships==
Glomred acted as a spiritual guide and advisor to his tribe's chieftain, [[Hadarog]],

==History==
After the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'' was stolen by a pair of humans, in the latter half of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Glomred and the other Spleen Eater orcs set out in pursuit of the thieves, guided by the [[Gruumsh|One-Eyed God]]. After traveling leagues across [[interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]], the orcs caught up with the group on one of the bridges that spanned the great [[Underchasm]]. Glomred began brief and tense negotiation with the humans, before the [[Shadovar]] intervened and allowed the thieves to escape. In the ensuing chaos, Glomred was shot with an arrow, his final fate in the fight unknown.
