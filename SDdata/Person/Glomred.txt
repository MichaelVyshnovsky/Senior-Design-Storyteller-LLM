Glomred was an orc shaman of the Spleen Eaters tribe that lived in Big Bone Deep during the late 15 century DR.
He wore a simple hauberk of chainmail.
Glomred acted as a spiritual guide and advisor to his tribes chieftain, Hadarog,
After the Eye of Gruumsh was stolen by a pair of humans, in the latter half of the , Glomred and the other Spleen Eater orcs set out in pursuit of the thieves, guided by the One-Eyed God. After traveling leagues across central Faer√ªn, the orcs caught up with the group on one of the bridges that spanned the great Underchasm. Glomred began brief and tense negotiation with the humans, before the Shadovar intervened and allowed the thieves to escape. In the ensuing chaos, Glomred was shot with an arrow, his final fate in the fight unknown.
