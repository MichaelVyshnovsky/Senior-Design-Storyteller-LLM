        "mainbody": "Around the same time By the time the [[Peers' Hall]] of the High Palace was built, Alustriel, alongside a few courtiers and the [[Citadel Adbar|Adbarrim]] King [[Harbromm]] of the Council of Nine Peers, met such heroes in her personal wing, where she bestowed upon them a variety of magical items. One was her ''Mythanthar's Orb'', which could seal away the evil beneath Hellgate Keep, as well as an amulet each, shaped like the head of a unicorn. These, if the command word, \"Lurue\", was spoken and the amulet pulled off of its chain, teleported their user directly outside of Silverymoon's Hunters' Gate. Despite the importance of the task, she did not wish her agents any undue harm, and so was ready to pay them handsomely for any recovered artifacts, information, or maps they made, duties beyond just slaying monsters.\n\nThe fledgling Luruar demanded so much of her attention that, on [[Tarsakh 22]] of the same year, Alustriel resigned her position as a Harper. Through a small, illusiory copy of herself, carried atop a disk, she announced to her fellow Master Harpers, while they met in [[Twilight Hall]], that being a member would conflict with her responsibilities to the people of the North and demoted herself to, at most, an ally of Those Who Harp. Her departure only worsened the chaos of the [[Harpers#Harper Schism|Harper Schism]].  \n\nLater in the year, as of the [[Nightal 30|30{{th}}]] of [[Nightal]], she was already known as the Queen and Lady Hope of Luruar. A few months prior, she asked Drizzt Do'Urden to compile a thorough report on the [[Underdark]],{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} not only to gather information on [[Blingdenstone]] and whether it could potentially become a member of the Alliance of Silverymoon, but also to track the dangers that festered below the lands of the North.\n\nAt some point in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Though she soon calmed down and returned to the pool's depths, Alustriel had seen her own memories, those of her prayer alongside Taern on the night that Mystra was destroyed, as well as those of others, all from that same period in time.\n\nDuring the final [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Alustriel was directly involved in the defense of her Silver Marches. When the [[Song dragon]] [[Taraunramorlamurla]] succumbed to the thrall of the Dracorage on her way to Silverymoon, it was the Bright Lady who returned her to her home in [[Waterdeep]]. From there, the pair worked alongside Laeral to retrieve other Waterdhavian dragons, and though they failed to save a handful of wyrms, most were brought back with only minor consequences, which put them all into the two Sisters' debt. In the Marches proper, Alustriel intervened when Deszeldaryndun Silverwing and his mate, [[Valamaradace]], turned their violence onto eachother, an act that earned her their fealty when they both swore to protect the nation of Luruar. Though she kept it from the dragon, the Lady Hope later made Valamaradace her heir.\n\nOn [[Ches 16]] of the next year, [[1374 DR]], Alustriel, accompanied by Methrammar, ventured to the Harper stronghold of [[Moongleam Tower]] at the behest of its leader, [[Eaerlraun Shadowlyn]]. There, she met with the elf [[Gaerradh]], who reported to the High Lady that another threat had been detected in the depths of the High Forest and demanded the attention of Luruar. Alustriel ultimately sent her son back with the young elven woman, to lead a number of Argent Legion batallions to the wood elves’ defense. \n\n=== After the Spellplague===\n[[File:Alustriel VEoR.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Shining Lady's reappearance in the 15{{th}}-century DR would prove essential to the defeat of the lich-god Vecna.'']]\nIt was believed that Alustriel died at some point following the [[Spellplague]], but, in fact, she and Laeral hid among the monks of [[Candlekeep]] to prepare for the destruction of the library's wards. In doing so, they were attempting to prevent anyone from utilizing them to wrest control over the [[Weave]]. \n\nIn [[1487 DR]], [[Larloch]] foiled their plans and absorbed the wards. Shortly thereafter, Alustriel, Laeral, Elminster, and the [[Srinshee]] prevented Larloch's ascension to godhood. This group, without the Shrinshee but with the addition of Storm and [[Amarune Whitewave]], later encountered the restored Mystra as her [[Chosen]].\n\nIn the time after her reappearance and the [[Second Sundering]], Alustriel did not contact Silverymoon. Even her son, and current High Mage of the City, Lord Methrammar Aerasumé, did not hear from her, despite the rumors that began to reach the city of the former High Lady's activities in the Southern Lands.",
        "Description": "Apart from being an intelligent, wise, and charismatic leader, Alustriel was also incredibly beautiful. It was said that those who gazed upon her immediately fell in love, a grandeur some [[bards]] refused to write about, claiming that they could never pen anything truly befitting of it. She was {{SI|5'11\"|ft-in|long=yes}} tallIn ''[[Starless Night]]'', Alustriel is instead described as being half a foot taller that [[Catti-brie]] on page 67, making the Bright Lady {{SI|6'0\"|ft-in|c}}. However, later mention on p. 101 of ''[[The Orc King]]'' again says that Alustriel is only nearly six feet tall, as does p. 16 of the ''[[Heroes' Lorebook]]'', corroborating the slightly-lesser height. and graceful, long silver hair, and everlasting youth common to the rest of her sisters. Most frequently, she wore monochromatic robes of grey or white, of full length and simple cut, exchanging them for darker-colored gowns during more formal circumstances. For many years, she carried with her her unicorn-headed ''[[staff of Silverymoon]]''.",
        "Personality": "{{Quote|''Stormy weather is always with us, somewhere in Faerûn. Beneath it, all too often, swords are out, the hand that wields one seeking to bury it in the body that wields another. Part of the way of things as the gods order, perhaps—or just the way of all of us flawed beings who walk this world. I fear I'll never see a day when no swords will be drawn—or needed. But then, perhaps my sight fails too soon.''|Alustriel, as quoted in one publication of ''[[To Harp and to Help]]''.<ref group=\"note\">Though ''[[Crown of Fire]]'' claims ''To Harp and to Help'' was written in the Year of the Deep Moon, that being [[1294 DR]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090604094848/http://www.wizards.com/forgottenrealms/FR_20001129b_P.asp Candlekeep Collection] suggests instead a writing date of [[1271 DR]], with the latter year being when Alustriel wrote her addendum to the original book.}}\nAlustriel was known to be one of the kindest and most astute rulers of Faerûn. She always judged wisely and with great honor, holding to the tenets of Silverymoon even among strangers, whom she regarded as she did friends: with open arms and little suspicion. \n\nShe always preferred to rely on diplomacy, grace, and understanding, rather than employ her magic, and, by extension, she veered any conflict away from a violent conclusion. Though she knew how often and how easily a situation could devolve into bloodshed, and was therefore prepared to engage into magical combat with the full and unrestrained use of her Art, she only allowed it to become an option after carefully and resolutely considering every other path first.  \n\nAlustriel's oft-carefree attitude ultimately belied the severity with which she treated her responsibility to the Silvaeren and to the North as a whole. When it came time to discuss politics, she proved herself sharply capable, bargaining only after carefully assessing both sides. Such was the character needed to make her dreams of a civilized North a reality not only radiant and intelligent, but also capably percipient. \n\nShe also developed a deep thoughtfulness and an eternal patience over her many years, perfectly willing to excuse most mischief or breach of etiquette. The bluster of hubris, the scorn of insults, even these she simply considered a bore. The only things that truly infuriated the Bright Lady were needless, cold-hearted behavior and the improper use of magic, though both came second to that which she considered prejudiced or unjust. Such actions were nonetheless useless in any attempt to manipulate her, as even when angered, Alustriel maintained the serenity of her composure and speech, always soft, never steely. It was impossible to provoke her into doing or saying something that she had not carefully thought about, and only those who knew her well could detect the signs that something had upset her.",
        "Abilities": {
            "As a Chosen": "{{Main|Chosen of Mystra}}\nBeing a Chosen of Mystra, Alustriel was well-regarded as a highly-capable and naturally-talented spellcaster, She was also exempt from a variety of spells, giving her immunity to being [[polymorph other|''polymorphed'' by another]], ''[[feeblemind]]ed'', or having her [[flesh to stone|flesh turned to stone]], as well as being ''[[chill touch]]ed'', ''[[web]]bed'',  ''[[sink|sunk]]'', or targeted by either a ''[[forcecage]]'' or a ''[[lightning bolt]]'', all rounded off by ''[[time stop]]''.\n\nConversely, Lady Silverhand had a selection of spells that she was able to cast at will, once every day. She could ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[polymorph any object]]'', ''[[shapechange]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''. Alustriel was also capable of using ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance|clairaudience]]'' and ''[[minor creation]]'', ''[[hold monster|holding monster]]s'', or causing an ''[[anti-magic shell]]''.",
            "As a Wizard": "At some point during her many years of study, Alustriel imbued herself with ''[[Serten's spell immunity]]'' and, once it was coupled with ''[[permanency]]'', further rendered herself untouchable to the attacks of any lesser wizard. the Shining Lady's repertoire even included a variety of rarely-known spells, such as ''[[Khelben's dweomerdoom]]'', which she cast with an amulet of moonstone carrying her symbol, ''[[Laeral's crowning touch]]'', and [[:Category:Alustriel's spells|those she created herself]], but she preferred relying on more common ones when possible. She was also one of the only three people who were thought to know the spells capable of recharging ''[[spellstars]]'', and one of the few Harpers experienced enough to be able to create a ''[[scroll of the Harpers]]''.\n\n[[File:Alustriel Spellcasting.png|thumb|left|350px|''Though she preferred making friends by other means, the Art undoubtedly had its uses.'']]\nAlustriel attested that her [[Spellguard]] were enough to protect her, which allowed her to, more often than not, do away with any violent or combat-oriented spells. Instead, she prepared those that helped facilitate her knowledge-gathering or caused little outward destruction, such as ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', and ''[[foresight]]'', among many others. She might humbly cast ''[[teleport]]'' to visit a favored grove on a beautifully moonlight occasion, to free herself of her bodyguards for a while, or even to help someone late to an important meeting, sparing them any embarassment. These meetings she might bolster through the use of ''[[Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion]]'', a favorite spell of hers, but not to gain any favor over those she sat across. She also greatly enjoyed the use of ''[[Fly]]'', as well as ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'', ''[[major creation]]'', the aformentioned ''magnificent mansion'', and ''teleport'', both in its standard and ''without error'' forms. Of all the spells at her fingertips, however, it was ''shapechange'' that she favored most, enjoying how much it could teach her about viewing the world from another's perspective. \n\nGiven the centuries she ruled the city, Alustriel became supremely knowledgeable on the magical [[wards of Silverymoon]], and was, during her time as the city's ruler, one of the few people allowed to cast spells within the city's High Palace, the others being the Spellguard.",
            "Skills": "Her intelligence, however, did not extend merely to spellcasting. Alustriel had a gifted memory, remembering a variety of minor details about other people or their lives with little difficulty, and furthermore, she was capable of bringing all such knowledge together to make educated, useful decisions. Her planning was not based on a magical divination, but rather a calculated and well-founded perspective on the matter, making her one of Toril's foremost strategists and foretellers. Whether juggling the responsibilities of several trade disputes or monster attacks, Alustriel was rarely overwhelmed. She shared very little of this information except with those trusted agents such as capable Harpers or her sons. On occasion, however, some parts would find their way into offhanded comments made in the presence of [[adventurer]]s, who would then go on to, unwittingly, pursue the goals of the High Lady.  \n\nThough she cared little for the monetary value of [[gems]] and other jewels, Alustriel’s adventuring days enabled her to develop a keen eye for the precious stones themselves. Her experiences with [[gnomes]] and [[dwarves]], as well as with the city of [[Mirabar]], made her capable of correctly identifying any jewel, regardless of drastic changes to their color or shape."
        },
        "Possessions": "Alustriel, during her many years as the ruler of Silverymoon, had access to any and all of the city's many resources. She rarely had a need for any standard equipment, As of the winter of [[1367 DR]], she always carried, at the very least, a pair of [[wand]]s, one being a ''[[wand of magic missiles]]'',, a [[staff]] or [[rod]], and two [[ring]]s. One of these was a unique ''[[teleport ring]]'' identical to the one worn by [[Storm Silverhand|Storm]], her younger sister. If she carried a staff, it would most likely be a ''[[staff of power]]'', on rare occasions a ''[[staff of wanderers]]'', or, in most unlikely circumstances, another sort entirely,<ref group=\"note\">Respectively, a 70% chance, a 29% chance, and a 1% chance. but if she wielded a rod, it was either a ''[[rod of absorption]]'' or [[rod of passage|one ''of passage'']], oftentimes the first of the two.<ref group=\"note\">Again, respectively, a 90% chance and a 10% chance.   \n\nIn later days, however, she preferred to carry her signature ''staff of Silverymoon'', as well as ''[[bracers of defense]]'' \n\nTo further ensure her own safety, the Shining Lady often carried a ''[[wand of illumination]]'', and, at some point, she also utilized a ''[[Grimwald's dagger]]'', becoming the first to popularize the use of such a weapon.{{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS|90}}\n\n[[File:Alustriel's gift to Bruenor.png|thumb|left|250px|''The locket would prove useful to the Companions of the Hall many times over their years of adventure.'']]\nOf note, in a more intimate capacity, around [[1356 DR]], Alustriel made for herself a locket, heart-shaped and carried on a golden chain, which contained a picture of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. The locket warmed whenever it neared the [[drow]] himself, and though she claimed it was only to better know when he, alongside the other [[Companions of the Hall]], returned to Silverymoon, it held a unique significance to the Bright Lady. Sheepish as she was to reveal the magic item, she bestowed it upon [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] so that he could more easily track down his allies during their voyage to [[Calimshan]]. As a gift to [[Catti-brie]], Alustriel also gave her a ''[[Cat's Eye circlet]]'' before the [[fighter]] went down into [[Menzoberranzan]]. \n\nOf all those magic items that she collected or created herself, she tended to give away for those who greater needed them, Much earlier on in her life, she also fashioned the ''[[lesser staffs of Silverymoon]]'', which were gifted to her trusted agents.",
        "Activities": {
            "Aims": "[[File:Alustriel fullbody.png|thumb|right|250px|''Over her many years, Alustriel's gaze never stopped watching over all of the North's civilized peoples.'']]\n{{Quote|''All that I ask you to understand is that, as leader of my city, I am forced at times to act for the overall good, whatever the cost to an individual.''|Alustriel, speaking to herself as well as to Drizzt, during her apology to the ranger.}}\nEver the utopic visionary, Alustriel sought to create a peaceful realm, one that would cultivate love, harmony, and glory, much like the [[elf|elven]] kingdom of [[Myth Drannor]]. It was only due to these lofty ideals, and her fair rulership, that the North began to shift from an untamed, violent wilderness to a land amenable to such civilization. So much did she do for the cultured peoples of the North that a saying came to be known, describing how anyone who wished to truly understand the splendors of humanity would visit Silverymoon, knowing that she was to thank for them. These same humans, as well as demihumans, both revered the High Lady as far as [[Baldur's Gate]] to the south, [[Icewind Dale]] to the north, and [[Iriaebor]] to the east. She had many high hopes, but it quickly became clear to people that there really did exist a chance she would recreate the cosmopolitan beauty of Myth Drannor.\n\nTo do so, she worked hard attempting to ensure that Silverymoon would not die if and when she did. She knew that to make Silverymoon strong was to make the North stronger, and so worked through every ally she could count on, both in the Harpers at Twilight and her own Silvaeren agents, to foster the indispensable nature of her city. It was a tireless job, ensuring that the Gem of the North became more than a simple centre of commerce and trade. It needed to be a rallying point to her people. It needed to show them that they could wish for more than just fewer orcs and warmer weather, for their future truly could be found in the North.\n\nDespite her desires, Alustriel knew that sometimes another course of action was necessary, such as, once again, her initial denial of Drizzt's presence in Silverymoon. This kind of situation, the sort where she had to knowingly treat someone unjustly, were one of the few things that deeply upset the unflappable Alustriel.",
            "Daily Routine": "During the mid-to-late 14{{th}}-century [[DR]], when she ruled still as High Mage, Alustriel's days in Silverymoon often followed a similar pattern. Though she rarely found a reason to venture far from Silverymoon and preferred not to waste time by visiting the courts of other rulers, she was ready to deviate from her habits when the need arose, such as to rescue lost [[dwarves]] or adventurers caught in precarious battles."
        },
        "Relationships": {
            "Family": "Alustriel had six siblings, together known as the [[Seven Sisters]], which included the Witch-Queen of the North, [[Laeral Silverhand]]. Working with her and with Alustriel's brother-in-law, [[Khelben Arunsun]], the three shared a magical bond as part of their participation in the Lords' Alliance, allowing them to call on the each other by thinking a single word. They reserved this for emergencies, as the call was magically impossible to ignore. \n\nLady Silverhand's family further included her many children. Most of them had different fathers, but the Tall Ones, twelve [[half-elf]] males with the surname [[Elven dictionary#A|Aerasumé]], were the sons of a tall elven lord. Though he had helped Alustriel gain his people's support for the expansion of Silverymoon, he was thereafter killed by [[orc]]s. The twelve were named [[Andelver Aerasumé|Andelver]], [[Dolthauvin Aerasumé|Dolthauvin]], [[Elinthalar Aerasumé|Elinthalar]], [[Ghaelryss Aerasumé|Ghaelryss]], [[Inthylyn Aerasumé|Inthylyn]], [[Lilinthar Aerasumé|Lilinthar]], [[Naerond Aerasumé|Naerond]], [[Raerilarr Aerasumé|Raerilarr]], [[Tarthilmor Aerasumé|Tarthilmor]], and [[Uoundeld Aerasumé|Uoundeld]], and they were all warriors of some skill.\n\nFor a few years in the late 1340's and early 1350's, Alustriel took in [[Perendra Raslemtar]], then fourteen, after [[Mirt|Mirt the Moneylender]] brought her to Silverymoon. The Shining Lady fostered the girl within the [[High Palace]] and raised her to maturity, both in her age and in her magical potential. Only a handful of years before [[1357 DR]] did Perendra leave her foster mother, electing to join the Harpers after departing on good and loving terms with Alustriel.\n[[File:TheWizardsThreeVecnaPromo.jpg|thumb|left|400px|''Alustriel, Tasha, and Mordenkainen pondering how to deal with a crisis.'']]",
            "Allies": "Numerous people across Faerûn admired Alustriel, and she counted just as many as close allies; she adored the sort of quick-witted person who could recite poetry or sagely writings, particularly in the form of parodies or comical monologues. The [[pegasi]]-riding Tall ones she sent beyond Silverymoon's walls, and within them patroled Phlynk, content to use his shapeshifting abilities whenever needed. Though she and the doppelganger were once intimate and held differing worldviews, they shared an infallible trust. However, of all those in Alustriel's court who devoted themselves to her, none did so more than Taern \"Thunderspell\" Hornblade, her long-time advisor, commander of her [[Spellguard]], and, later, her successor as High Mage.  \n\n{{fq\n| text   = ''Why — the Lady asked me to, of course. Did y'not hear?''\n| source = A butcher's simple reasoning for giving Alustriel his entire stock without question.\n| float  = center\n| width  = \n}}\nThough Alustriel was more than a ruler to most of her citizens, the large majority of her people would also unflinchingly accept any duty she asked of them. They considered Alustriel a genuine friend, one who took care to have a personal heart-to-heart with anyone she knew was struggling from grief or loneliness, or simply because they had an air of fatigue. She even appeared to meet and praise newborn Silvaeren. When she was still the High Lady Mage, Alustriel could also, at any moment, call upon two dozen Harpers or half that number in apprentices, as well as six more mages of varying ability. The Harpers at Twilight always kept an eye on her, with agents constantly nearby to help when needed.\n\nAs fellow Chosen of Mystra, Alustriel was a friend, and one-time apprentice, to [[Elminster]], as well as a known Harper alongside Khelben. Her work as part of Those Who Harp earned her the reverence of all its members and the respect of the North's people, who used her name as a blessing. That is, they would jump to help anyone who cried out her name, caring little, whether they be a low farmhand or the most experienced adventurer, for the risk to their own lives. Any news that someone had died in her name would always bring the Lady Hope to tears.\n\n[[File:Alustriel meets Drizzt.png|thumb|left|350px|''Alustriel as she appeared the first time she met Drizzt Do'Urden, who would go on to become a close friend of the High Lady.'']]\nAlustriel was even admired by certain [[Uthgardt]] tribes, whose warriors were also ready to lay down their lives for her.\n\nAmong her friends in the lands of northern Faerûn, Alustriel counted the sage [[Esklindrar Iol]], whose rich knowledge she valued highly enough to cast a set of protective spells on both his person and the tomes he sold. Within the Harpers' ranks were [[Asilther Graelor]], a commonly-known ally of Lady Silverhand,{{Cite dragon/187/The Lonely Harpist and the Lady Rogue|51}} and later [[Elsura Dauniir]], whom she sent to Those Who Harp to refine her magical skills. The peace of Silverymoon and the nearby lands was not only due to her connections to that goodly organization, however, but also the influence of the [[Shadowcloak]] and the [[Mistmaster]], two local spellcasters of great capabilities. Alustriel further relied on the dragon [[Deszeldaryndun Silverwing]], giving him permission to magically disguise himself as her when she needed it.{{Cite dragon/236/Wyrms of the North: Deszeldaryndun|55}}{{Cite dragon annual/1998/By Dragons Ruled and Divided|9}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Deszeldaryndun}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/By Dragons Ruled and Divided}}\n\n[[File:Alustriel's Gift to Drizzt.png|thumb|right|225px|''Though she was forced to turn him away, Alustriel did what she could to help Drizzt and the other Companions of the Hall.'']]\nIn the [[Sword Coast]], the elderly she-dragon, [[Amaeraszantha]], considered her a friend, as did [[Amelior Amanitas]] of [[Secomber]]. Farther away, in [[Cormyr]], Alustriel also developed a working relationship with [[Myschanta Halarra]] of [[Arabel]], a well-regarded mage-for-hire. Since sometime around [[1336 DR]], Myschanta was called upon for aid in times of need, and, in turn, the sorceress trusted the Shining Lady well enough to have her body transported directly to Alustriel through a ''[[contingency]]'' spell should she be killed or severely wounded. Though this rarely occurred over the years of their friendship, it shocked the Silvaeren court every time. Even in Tethyr, which often distrusted the Harpers, Alustriel's name was respected.",
            "Enemies": "It was rare for Alustriel to have any truly personal foes, Even so, for centuries later, Alustriel held onto the belief that it was not luck that kept her from dying before the other Chosen appeared, but rather some still-human part of Sammaster. The same part, she thought, that took over his faculties in their battle's final moments, choosing to lose after recognizing the error of his ways. \n\nAs of [[1370 DR]], Sammaster's [[dracolich]] legacy had spawned [[Daurgothoth]], the Creeping Doom. Though she, and the other Chosen of Mystra, knew well Daurgothoth's endeavours, she was stopped from intervening because of the way that his experiments ultimately fomented the growth of magic itself, as was Mystra's own goal. She did her best, however, to combat the threat of his descendant Cult, and was often the target of their attacks in turn, as most continued their attempts to avenge Sammaster on her.\n\nAs uncommon as it was, Alustriel occassionally displeased certain individuals over her many years of life. As far away as [[Daggerford]], the silent [[Maranta]] refused to acknowledge those who had heard Alustriel's hypothesis that her curse was due to [[Malar]], and, similarly, the dwarven wizard [[Behring]] rejected the Lady's suggestion that his magical affinities came from some human blood in his lineage."

        "History": {
            "Early Years": "Born in the {{YearlinkName|762}}, Endué Alustriel was the second child of [[Elué Shundar]], a half-elven sorceress, and [[Dornal Silverhand]], a land-ruling human nobleman somewhere near [[Neverwinter]]. The first five years of her childhood in [[Silverhand Tower]] were peaceful enough, but, in [[767 DR]], her father began to notice that Elué's health had drastically deteriorated. Believing his wife to be possessed, Dornal thought to spare the woman he loved any further torment and chose to kill her. It was at this moment that the goddess of magic, [[Mystra]], revealed herself to him as the true mother of his daughters, having shared Elué's body so that she might better guide the creation of her blessed Chosen. The grieving Dornal took little comfort in this, however, and so left her, Endué, and the rest of his daughters behind. Now orphaned, the Silverhand girls would need new homes.\n\nMystra took Endué and her eldest sister, [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand|Anastra Syluné]], to [[Bluetower]], the home of a strict [[Harper]] known as [[Thamator|Thamator the Old]]. The goddess introduced the two girls to him as though they were, in fact, his nieces, whom he thought had recently died with his [[Rarleniir|younger brother]] and [[Selûneshar|sister-in-law]]. Thamator had hoped to train both of his 'nieces' as [[rangers]], grooming them for a future with the Harpers, but unfortunately for him, neither girl took to such a lifestyle. Soon enough, Anastra's natural talent for [[Arcane magic|the Art]] manifested itself and she was apprenticed to a master, leaving Endué, now alone, to spend her miserable youth letting Thamator down. Only once her foster-father saw her own magical gifts, which she used to defend herself from the unwanted advances of a pigheaded young man, was he finally satisfied. She had shown herself to be an asset to Those Who Harp, and so he assigned a Harper mage in his household to serve as her tutor.\n\n[[File:Alustriel sigil.png|thumb|right|125px|''Alustriel's personal mage sigil.'']]\nThe hardship of her childhood taught her, most of all, that happiness was not something that would simply happen to her. She had to chase it, and she would have to share it. For this reason, Alustriel took to adventuring early in her life, unquestionably talented with magic. Soon enough, the young wizard found herself with abilities beyond even those of the mages teaching her, finding that she could innately connect to the very foundation of her spellcasting. She did not bend magic to her will, but rather worked alongside it, becoming an extension of of the Art just as it extended through her.  Her strong ideas about fostering peace between all races, promoting the arts, these overcame her, and so Alustriel abandoned her wanderings early to travel to Silverymoon and see her ideas realized.",
            "High Mage of Silverymoon": "[[File:Alustriel in shadows.png|thumb|left|250px|''Alustriel, in regal Silvaeren attire.'']]\n{{Quote|''Whatever I may have done in what you have seen was not done alone. You are thanking me for the work of many. I accept on their behalf.''|Alustriel, in response to Elminster complimenting her for Silverymoon's beauty''.}}\nAlustriel ruled Silverymoon as High Mage, no longer disguised, for nearly a century-and-a-half, rising to become widely heralded as the most beloved ruler in all [[Faerûn]]. She continued to personally sponsor the Lady's College which she'd originally established during her time as Elué, Early in her second career as the High Mage, in the {{YearlinkName|1263}}, the people of Silverymoon were shocked to find more than a hundred [[tressym]] nesting on their roofs for about a tenday, something that Alustriel did little to remedy. She pointed to the prophecies of [[Alaundo]] as proof that the creatures' presence was fated and, though most did move on of their own accord, quite a few remained in the the city and made their homes there.\n\nSome time around [[1338 DR]], a legendary blade of the North known as ''[[Susk]]'', or the Silent Sword, was seen in Alustriel's court. It was wielded by [[Abadda Moonglamaer]], who was challenged by [[Distyl]] of Nesmé, there and then, to a duel, one that ended with the swordsman's death and Distyl's subsequent claim over Susk.{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|23}}\n\nWhen the [[Nar Kerymhoarth|Nameless Dungeon]] was discovered by adventurers in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, it caused an uproar in the North's elven population. The discussion surrounding it was so fervent that Alustriel was even visited by a diplomat from [[Evermeet]] asking her to make outlaws out of those who had plundered its ancient halls, a request she modestly acquiesed to. The elven guard established around the Nameless Dungeon was bolstered by some of Silverymoon's soldiers and successfully kept out any trespassers, only allowing those with special tokens, bestowed solely by the High Lady herself, to pass through. She only rarely granted these and, even then, they were largely given to scholars and historians. \n\nWhen the news of Syluné's passing reached Silverymoon, Alustriel bore her grief heavily, a state reflected by her city. She established a tenday period of mourning across the entire Gem of the North, but the High Lady personally maintained it for almost an entire year.\n\n[[File:Alustriel awoken by Bruenor.png|thumb|right|250px|''Ever graceful, even when so suddenly awakened by King Bruenor Battlehammer in the wee hours of the night.'']]\nIn [[1357 DR]], Alustriel allied with Khelben once more to break Laeral out of the influence of the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', restoring her sister's humanity for the first time since she'd put on the ''Crown'' twenty years before.{{Cite dragon/181/Pages from the Mages|18}}<ref group=\"note\">Page 34 of ''[[The Code of the Harpers]]'' instead suggests that Alustriel was preoccupied with her duties in the North when Laeral was broken free from the ''Crown of Horns''' control. However, it intimates that this was because she and Storm were rescuing Silverymoon from Shallos Ethenfrost and the orc horde, an event that had already taken place nearly one-hundred years prior. It was during this year Alustriel also established one of her most important political alliances, that with Mithral Hall, when she aided its newly-established King Battlehammer against drow incursions, particularly from [[House Baenre]].\n\nAround 20 years after the mage [[Nchaser]]'s disappearance, Alustriel briefly came to possess his spellbook, [[Nchaser's Eiyromancia]]. She gifted it to a [[dwarf]] from [[Citadel Adbar]], but lost track of it after that same dwarf, too, disappeared.{{Cite dragon/62/Pages from the Mages|17}}\n\nIn mid-[[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, when Mystra was destroyed during the Time of Troubles, Alustriel was in her chambers within the High Palace of Silverymoon. Nearby, a hidden doorway connected her to Taern, her closest guard and confidant, while her magic connected her mind to his disconcerted one. He was praying. Though he felt the effects of Mystra's passing, the root cause was not yet clear to him in the way that it was to Alustriel. Some time earlier in the year, when the goddess shared her Power among her Chosen, a portion of it went to the High Lady of Silverymoon, enough that Alustriel's body — her hair, eyes, hands, all — glowed with a blue-white aura. Enough that her magic, stronger than ever, could be felt with just a touch. Though she tried her best to comfort Taern, even Alustriel could not ignore the severity of the situation, finding that tears had begun to stream down her face and grief choked her words. She joined him in prayer, no longer directed to her mother but to [[Azuth]], so that the god might guide [[Elminster]]\n\nDuring this same period of unstable magic, Alustriel attempted to light her way through a dark cellar in Silverymoon. The spell she casted, otherwise simple, instead surprised her by bringing down the whole of the tower that rested above her.\n\nIn [[Uktar]] of the same year, Alustriel went on a trip with one of her sisters, [[Dove Falconhand|Dove]], to Waterdeep, where the two visited the home of Amelior Amanitas. His absence meant the pair let themselves in and made a mess, and their attempts to clean up only made it worse, so Alustriel left him a gift to make up for it.\n\nAt some point during or just prior to {{Yearlink|1360}}, Alustriel participated in a meeting of senior Harpers, once more alongside Dove as well as her husband, [[Florin Falconhand]], Elminster, [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], and a man known only as [[Urso]]. The discussion centered around the growing [[Zhentarim]] presence in the [[Anauroch]] It was during this same year that Alustriel received Myschanta's burned corpse, thanks to the latter's ''contingency'', after the [[Night Parade]] killed her during their infiltration of Arabel. The High Lady worked to have the woman ''[[resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' after only a few tendays,{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|37}} and, once Arabel was saved, the wizard was already alive and well while she recovered in Silverymoon.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|43}}\n\n[[File:Alustriel Smiles.png|thumb|left|250px|''Though her rulership carried with it no small measure of responsibilities, Alustriel often worked just as hard to maintain her high spirits.'']]\nAt some point prior to [[1361 DR]], Alustriel was informed of the debt that she, and the whole of Silverymoon, owed to the family of [[Margie MacLickel]]. To pay this, Margie and her husband, [[Argint MacLickel|Argint \"Mac\" MacLickel]] were given the ''[[Queen of the Rivers]]'', an enchanted trading ship whose creation was overseen by the Bright Lady after she accompanied the couple, married in Silverymoon only a little while prior, to [[Teshendale]]. \n\nWhen her elder sister, Syluné, was thought to have returned sometime in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Alustriel met with the rest of the Seven in a cottage outside of [[Shadowdale]] to discuss their next course of action. Though the Bright Lady seemed hopeful that Syluné truly had returned to life, her sisters were not so confident, and so she ultimately assented to [[Qilué Veladorn|Qilué]]'s plan of sending her daughter, Alustriel's niece, [[Ysolde Veladorn]] to deal with the false Sister, who was in fact the [[drow]], [[Liriel Baenre]]. It was during this same year that Alustriel was goaded out of the wards of her city by members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], four archmages who casted spells just outside Silverymoon's walls. Half of their number were quickly eliminated by the Bright Lady, working in cooperation with Taern Hornblade, but after he and the Spellguard were called to deal with a [[dracolich]] on the city's southern wall, she was left vulnerable. One more enemy archmage fell before the fourth and final one gained the upper hand on Alustriel, but, thankfully, her life was saved by the sudden appearance of Laeral and Khelben Arunsun, whom Alustriel magically called through their telepathic bond.\n\nAt some point in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Alustriel requested that Elminster put together a guide to the Unapproachable East for the Harpers — a task he readily passed onto his assistant and scribe, [[Lhaeo]]. Around the middle of the same year, Lhaeo, having now returned to his identity as Haedrak III, reunited Alustriel with her foster daughter, Perendra, in Silverymoon, as part of a plan to put an end to the [[Reclamation Wars]] in Tethyr. \n\nThe [[1369 DR|next year]], Alustriel was a guest at Haedrak's wedding on the [[Kythorn 30|30{{th}}]] of [[Kythorn]]. Her gift took the form of magical wards at his Royal Palace, [[Faerntarn]], as well as installing stones from Syluné's cottage into the castle's own floor, allowing the woman to manifest within its halls. She, alongside Elminster, also enchanted both Haedrak's and [[Zaranda Star|his wife]]'s state crowns with a variety of magical effects. \n\nLater in the year, prior to the middle of [[Eleasis]], Alustriel would yet again have to face the evil brewing in Hellgate Keep after [[Tanta Hagara]] rallied her forces into hordes that caused chaos across the North, including the lands near Silverymoon. The High Lady defended her city personally, weaving such powerful spells against the raiding demons that the city itself was left untouched, until eventually they were all successfully pushed back with help from the Harpers, Turlang, and the Mistmaster. By autumn, after the Keep's destruction, it was rumored by some that it was Alustriel's doing that caused the avalanche that blocked [[Turnstone Pass]], and Upvale with it, as a way to protect Sundabar and Citadel Felbarr from those demons that had survived and fled Hellgate Keep, though most attributed it to the treant [[Turlang]]. Some time after these events, the High Lady sent a troop of her Silvaeren guards to investigate why [[trolls]] had been venturing further from the [[Evermoors]] since the last year, which was found to be due to a group of around twenty [[fog giants]] of friendly disposition, who had made their home in the trolls' former habitat. Given the instability of the time, Alustriel also decreed that, for the time being, each of her patrol of Knights be accompanied by a pair of Spellguards riding with them.\n\nAmong everything else that demanded the Lady Hope's attention, rumors arose that a man fitting the description of [[Orjalun]], a previous High Mage who mysteriously disappeared centuries ago, was seeking ''[[The Arbatel]]''. Alustriel herself was very curious about the truth of this information, asking those who had heard the rumors for further news. \n\nAlustriel was awoken, alongside others faithful of Mystra like Laeral, in the early hours of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] by the [[Mad Mage of Undermountain]]'s desperate message. \n\nOne of her last acts as the High Mage was to encourage [[Arkhen]] of [[Arkhen's Invocatorium]] to leave his institute and collaborate with her idea for a unified school of magic, later known as the [[Conclave of Silverymoon]], an idea that would also benefit the husk of [[Fochlucan]]. Though it was only in [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1369}} that the University was publicly established, The Harper [[Myrthos Shyllantham]] inquired to see if Alustriel could not finance the reclamation of the once-presitigious bard school, having been shut since the orc siege that prompted the Lady Hope's return, especially since she had always refused to tear down the building. Though no one had stepped in to restore its halls as she'd hoped, it was suggested the Conclave might have a use for its legacy.",
            "High Lady of the Silver Marches": "Though she was no longer the High Mage of Silverymoon, Alustriel's first few years as the leader of a blossoming Northern confederation were not easy, now having to balance the concerns of so many settlements. For example, before even the spring of [[1370 DR]], news reached the Gem of the North that the [[treant]]s, still led by Turlang, had begun expanding their territory. The Shining Lady was concerned that the forest, left unchecked, would begin to reach Everlund and hinder trade over the [[Evermoor Way]]. Should the treant push too close, Alustriel planned to resolve the issue by having a mediating discussion with Turlang alongside a newfound ally: [[Jeryth Phaulkon]], herself a [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]]. In the meantime, Alustriel continued to financially support the construction of the [[Rauvin Road]], which would strengthen the trail that connected Silverymoon to nearby [[Nesmé]]. Though trade discussions with the town, as well as with [[Longsaddle]]’s [[Harpell]] family, were slowgoing, she believed that the road would prove beneficial for all parties, despite how difficult it would prove to defend those traveling over it.\n\nFor a time, she still ruled from the High Palace of Silverymoon, but it had not been built with the space to permit two governing bodies. Both she and Taern decided it needed expanding and, as soon as spring arrived, construction began on the city's eastern walls, garrisons, and the Palace, with the estimation that the two rulers would have to share the seat of power for up to a year until completion was achieved. Given her plans to host a [[Council of the Marches|Council of Twelve Peers]] to aid her during her rule, as well as the help of the [[Heralds of Faerûn]] and their historical insights, Lady Silverhand absolutely needed sufficient space for everyone involved.\n\n[[Erssler Thamm]], the Vigilant Master of the city's Brothers of [[Helm]], was eager to help. The clergymen gave over certain quarters and offices, as well as the smaller of the [[House Invincible]]'s chapels, as an assembly hall for the nation's fledgling army. It seemed the god approved of her work, and, since she did not even need demand it of them, the Bright Lady was only more deeply appreciative. In addition to the followers of Helm, Alustriel also spoke to certain clergy of [[Selûne]], those of the [[Temple of Silver Stars]], with the hope that they might venture into the northern countryside, mapping territory alongside Harpers and priests of [[Deneir]].\n\n{{fq\n| text   = ... I have no wish to see my people nor my realm suffer the fates that befell Ascalhorn or Eaerlann. I beseech those who take the mantle of heroes to stand forth and prevent such depredations from spreading further than the wards that once penned them in. For doing this, ye shall receive my blessings and those of the people, and perhaps even those of the five goddesses of Luruar.\n| source = The Lady Hope of Luruar, calling for the aid of adventurers in dealing with the remains of Hellgate Keep.\n| float  = center\n| width  = 400px\n}}\nAround the same time By the time the [[Peers' Hall]] of the High Palace was built, Alustriel, alongside a few courtiers and the [[Citadel Adbar|Adbarrim]] King [[Harbromm]] of the Council of Nine Peers, met such heroes in her personal wing, where she bestowed upon them a variety of magical items. One was her ''Mythanthar's Orb'', which could seal away the evil beneath Hellgate Keep, as well as an amulet each, shaped like the head of a unicorn. These, if the command word, \"Lurue\", was spoken and the amulet pulled off of its chain, teleported their user directly outside of Silverymoon's Hunters' Gate. Despite the importance of the task, she did not wish her agents any undue harm, and so was ready to pay them handsomely for any recovered artifacts, information, or maps they made, duties beyond just slaying monsters.\n\nThe fledgling Luruar demanded so much of her attention that, on [[Tarsakh 22]] of the same year, Alustriel resigned her position as a Harper. Through a small, illusiory copy of herself, carried atop a disk, she announced to her fellow Master Harpers, while they met in [[Twilight Hall]], that being a member would conflict with her responsibilities to the people of the North and demoted herself to, at most, an ally of Those Who Harp. Her departure only worsened the chaos of the [[Harpers#Harper Schism|Harper Schism]].  \n\nLater in the year, as of the [[Nightal 30|30{{th}}]] of [[Nightal]], she was already known as the Queen and Lady Hope of Luruar. A few months prior, she asked Drizzt Do'Urden to compile a thorough report on the [[Underdark]],{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} not only to gather information on [[Blingdenstone]] and whether it could potentially become a member of the Alliance of Silverymoon, but also to track the dangers that festered below the lands of the North.\n\nAt some point in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Though she soon calmed down and returned to the pool's depths, Alustriel had seen her own memories, those of her prayer alongside Taern on the night that Mystra was destroyed, as well as those of others, all from that same period in time.\n\nDuring the final [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Alustriel was directly involved in the defense of her Silver Marches. When the [[Song dragon]] [[Taraunramorlamurla]] succumbed to the thrall of the Dracorage on her way to Silverymoon, it was the Bright Lady who returned her to her home in [[Waterdeep]]. From there, the pair worked alongside Laeral to retrieve other Waterdhavian dragons, and though they failed to save a handful of wyrms, most were brought back with only minor consequences, which put them all into the two Sisters' debt. In the Marches proper, Alustriel intervened when Deszeldaryndun Silverwing and his mate, [[Valamaradace]], turned their violence onto eachother, an act that earned her their fealty when they both swore to protect the nation of Luruar. Though she kept it from the dragon, the Lady Hope later made Valamaradace her heir.\n\nOn [[Ches 16]] of the next year, [[1374 DR]], Alustriel, accompanied by Methrammar, ventured to the Harper stronghold of [[Moongleam Tower]] at the behest of its leader, [[Eaerlraun Shadowlyn]]. There, she met with the elf [[Gaerradh]], who reported to the High Lady that another threat had been detected in the depths of the High Forest and demanded the attention of Luruar. Alustriel ultimately sent her son back with the young elven woman, to lead a number of Argent Legion batallions to the wood elves’ defense.",
            "After the Spellplague": "[[File:Alustriel VEoR.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Shining Lady's reappearance in the 15{{th}}-century DR would prove essential to the defeat of the lich-god Vecna.'']]\nIt was believed that Alustriel died at some point following the [[Spellplague]], but, in fact, she and Laeral hid among the monks of [[Candlekeep]] to prepare for the destruction of the library's wards. In doing so, they were attempting to prevent anyone from utilizing them to wrest control over the [[Weave]]. \n\nIn [[1487 DR]], [[Larloch]] foiled their plans and absorbed the wards. Shortly thereafter, Alustriel, Laeral, Elminster, and the [[Srinshee]] prevented Larloch's ascension to godhood. This group, without the Shrinshee but with the addition of Storm and [[Amarune Whitewave]], later encountered the restored Mystra as her [[Chosen]].\n\nIn the time after her reappearance and the [[Second Sundering]], Alustriel did not contact Silverymoon. Even her son, and current High Mage of the City, Lord Methrammar Aerasumé, did not hear from her, despite the rumors that began to reach the city of the former High Lady's activities in the Southern Lands."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Few details were known about Alustriel and the other Chosens' combat against Sammaster, known as the [[Battle of the Chosen]], purely due to the sheer scope of their conflicting powers. As of 1370 DR, Alustriel had suggested that some of the Evermoors' barren hills were caused by their fight, and it was rumored that, even then, at least one of the Chosen must have actively concentrated on weakening the battle's effect on the [[Weave]] and the land itself. It is suspected, due to her injured state and her love for the North, that this was Alustriel's role.\n\nThough the full extent of her age was not public knowledge, as of [[1365 DR]], it was rumored that Alustriel must have been centuries old, \n\nGiven that her beauty earned her the ardent affections of many people during her years, there were just as many children rumored to be those of the lovely High Lady of Silverymoon. The half-elf [[Fetitia Ledora]] of Everlund, one of the two founders of the second [[Sisterhood of the Silver Fire]], was one such possible daughter, which would have made her the eldest known of Alustriel's children. Another bit of hearsay said she had a child with Phlynk, her doppelganger ally, given how their close friendship began as an even more intimate relationship. Supposedly, their offspring would have inherited the best of its mother's magical prowess and its other parent's shapeshifting nature.\n\nDespite the threat posed to the North by the dragon [[Klauth]], certain rumors suggested that he chose to trade information to Alustriel rather than face her directly, and, in exchange, they struck a bargain to mutually leave one another undisturbed.{{Cite dragon/244/Wyrms of the North: Klauth|57}}{{Cite dragon annual/1998/By Dragons Ruled and Divided|11}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Klauth, \"Old Snarl\"}} However, during the early period of Luruar's creation in 1370 DR,\n\nIn sharp contrast to her general reputation, among people who distrusted magic and those who wielded it by extension, it was ignorantly thought that Lady Hope, alongside other powerful mages such as Khelben Blackstaff and Elminster, would gather at [[Ironfang Keep]] to decide the fate of all Faerûn."
