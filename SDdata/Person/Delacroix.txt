'''Delacroix''' was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[arcanist ]] and [[alchemist]] who taught at the [[Alchemical Seminary]] in [[Eileanar]] shortly before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Delacroix was an expert alchemist with a focus on [[potion]]s and [[oil]]s, and taught this skill at the Seminary under the supervision of [[Quintus]]. Alongside [[Colombier]], she was considered one of the more practical and relatable teachers there, as everyone could appreciate the applications of useful potions and [[magical powder]]s.
