        "mainbody": "'''Arrabas Snome''' was the patriarch of the noble [[Snome]] family of [[Waterdeep]] for much of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He oversaw the family's brewing and distilling companies and an import business that specialized in alcoholic beverages. He named his youngest grandson, [[Dandobar Snome|Dandobar]], as his heir before he passed away sometime around [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "Arrabas was quite rotund. He extended his life through the use of [[magic]] [[potion]]s and regimens and therefore appeared younger than his age.",
        "Personality": "He was a very practical man with particular notions on how the family businesses should be run. He could be quite stubborn. He bragged that he had tasted every type of distilled spirits known across [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Relationships": "Arrabas loved his family but was disappointed in all fourteen of his children, whom he considered too careless and profligate to run the family business the way he felt it should be managed. He never designated an heir from among his children and he outlived all of them. At the age of 112, he was considering the prospects of all of his 47 grandchildren. The oldest granddaughter, [[Thyriellentha Snome|Thyriellentha]], was the logical choice and the assumed favorite. However, the youngest grandson, Dandobar, had undertaken a year-long junket through [[Calimshan]] and the cities around the [[Lake of Steam]], and returned with agreements, formulas, and alliances that greatly expanded the family business and opened up export opportunities.",
        "History": "Arrabas was seventeen when the Snome family was ennobled. He eventually rose to be the patriarch of the family and held that position for the better part of a century."
