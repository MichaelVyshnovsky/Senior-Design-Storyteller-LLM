'''Latasha''' was a beautiful and dangerous [[vampire]] member of the [[Night Masks]] in [[Westgate]] around [[1374 DR]].

==History==
In 1374 DR, Latasha had three meetings with an adventurer who was trying to destroy the Night Masks. In the last, she was in her sarcophagus in the [[Lair of the Night Masters]] with [[Kreed]] when the adventurer managed to enter the lair and destroyed her.
