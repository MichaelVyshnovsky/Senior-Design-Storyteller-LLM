Narim Sandir was a dwarven inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Narim was the dean of the College of Combat Technique. He would train students and traveling adventurers alike so long as they had the coin to cover the steep tuition costs.
In addition to his duties with the college, Narim enjoyed smithing and was quite accomplished.
