Her true identity is not known surviving ballads referred to her only as \"the Stargazer\".\nShe came into the possession of the sword called One Thousand Broken Dreams, and with it she killed hundreds of drow over her lifetime. Finally, she died of grief over the death of her sister after the Battle of Nine Arrows. As for her sword, a young elf archer took it and retreated so approaching drow reinforcements could not claim it."
