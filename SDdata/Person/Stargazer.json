        "mainbody": "The '''Stargazer''' was an elven heroine who lived millennia before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Her true identity is not known; surviving ballads referred to her only as \"the Stargazer\".\n\nShe came into the possession of the sword called ''[[One Thousand Broken Dreams]]'', and with it she killed hundreds of [[drow]] over her lifetime. Finally, she died of grief over the death of her sister after the [[Battle of Nine Arrows]]. As for her sword, a young elf archer took it and retreated so approaching drow reinforcements could not claim it."
