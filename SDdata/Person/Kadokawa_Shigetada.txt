'''Kadokawa Shigetada''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Niwa clan]] and shugo-matadai of [[Okahira]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Kadokawa lived in Okahira, where he had his office. He led a council that took care of affairs when [[Hiro Yoshitoki]] was away. Recently, however, he had fallen under the influence of the [[Shou]] [[wu jen]] [[Hu Chien]] and under his suggestion Kadokawa introduced many reforms.

==Personality==
Kadokawa was totally in thrall of Hu Chien and never listened to people that opposed him.
