Kadokawa Shigetada was a samurai retainer of the Niwa clan and shugo-matadai of Okahira in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Kadokawa lived in Okahira, where he had his office. He led a council that took care of affairs when Hiro Yoshitoki was away. Recently, however, he had fallen under the influence of the Shou wu jen Hu Chien and under his suggestion Kadokawa introduced many reforms.
Kadokawa was totally in thrall of Hu Chien and never listened to people that opposed him.
