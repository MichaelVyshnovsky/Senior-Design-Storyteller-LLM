Nethmoun Aln was a reclusive wizard who lived in a ramshackle hut on the east side of Scornubel.
He protected his home with flying daggers, margoyle, and modified Evards black tentacles spells. Nethmoun was a collector of rare spells. He sometimes sent his strikingly beautiful cook, or a projected image of her, out into the city to discover new spells or effects.
