'''Nethmoun Aln''' was a reclusive [[wizard]] who lived in a ramshackle hut on the east side of [[Scornubel]].

He protected his home with flying daggers, [[margoyle]], and modified ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'' spells. Nethmoun was a collector of rare spells. He sometimes sent his strikingly beautiful cook, or a projected image of her, out into the city to discover new spells or effects.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|106}}
