'''Ghaubhan Szaurr''' was a [[Zhentarim]] plant in the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was treacherous.

==Possessions==
He had a wand, and wore a dark cloak.

==Activities==
He commanded a force of [[Zhentilar]] in the [[Stonelands]], which passed themselves off as members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Relationships==
Ghaubhan Szaurr was a double agent, a plant of the [[Zhentarim]] who worked inside the [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Manshoon]]'s orders without the knowledge of the priestly branch of the Zhentarim. However, he was ultimately ready to serve himself alone. He also taught a number of magelings as apprentices, including [[Ramath]].

==History==
Prior to the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, Ghaubhan Szaurr had read a book by [[Asklannan]] detailing a manner of acquiring [[spellfire]] from another who had it.

As of {{yearlink|1357}}, Ghaubhan Szaurr was already known to [[Fzoul Chembryl]] as a man serving Manshoon,{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|231|14}} and not really a mage in service of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], though he told the latter to [[Xarlraun]] during their meeting.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|76|4}} He became activated to the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]] late that year, when he was informed by one of the magelings he was training, [[Ramath]], who'd had a vision of a blonde woman wreathed in flames, a dwarf, and others coming their way. Ghaubhan quickly reasoned it was a vision of Shandril, and prepared to capture them.

While preparing, Ghaubhan Szaurr was surprised by [[Manshoon]] teleporting to his position in the Stonelands; the head of the Zhentarim recognized that Ghaubhan was about to attempt to seize spellfire. After offering the men in Ghaubhan's retinue a chance to surrender, Manshoon slew them. He then revealed that Ramath was one of Manshoon's spies as well, and slew Ghaubhan.

==Rumors & Legends==
Ghaubhan Szaurr was under the impression, thanks to Asklannan's book, that those who "joined" with a spellfire wielder, an act strongly implied to be carnal in nature, stood a chance of gaining it themselves.
