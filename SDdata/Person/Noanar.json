        "Description": "The Fire Warden was a talented arcanist who specialized in fire-based [[magic]].",
        "History": "Noanar was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1505|NY}} south of Netheril and became a wanderer of [[north Faer√ªn]]. After much travelling, the arcanist settled in [[Canlespiere]]. In {{YearlinkConvert|1535|NY}}, the [[archwizard]] [[Ioulaum]] bestowed upon Noanar the title of \"Fire Warden\". Noanar later developed much of the well-known fire-based spells that were used around the [[Realms]]. Noanar practiced his spells on [[ogre]]s around Canlespiere. However, he was killed in a skirmish with these ogres in {{YearlinkConvert|1559|NY}}."
