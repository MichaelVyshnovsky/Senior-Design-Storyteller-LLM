'''Gareth Jadaren''' was a pirate serving aboard the ''[[Orcsblood]]''.  In [[1460 DR]], the ''Orcsblood'' attacked a merchant ship and Gareth took a [[magic]] bracelet known as the [[Rythanko]] from a [[Githyanki]] passenger.  Unkown to Gareth, the bracelet was linked to an entity named [[Fandour]] who was imprisoned in a pocket plane.	

Gareth and his shipmate [[Ivor Beguine]] became disgusted with the brutality of the ''Orcsblood's'' captain and the first mate [[Helgre]] and they both jumped ship near [[Mulmaster]].  After rowing a small boat to shore, they met two [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]], [[Lakini]] and [[Lusk]], and gave them the location of the ''Orcsblood''. The devas borrowed Gareth's boat and rowed out to the ''Orcsblood'' and slaughtered the crew although Helgre escaped.	

While in Mulmaster, Gareth and Ivor met a young apprentice [[mage]] named [[Jandi M'baren]]. Ivor and Jandi fell in love and the three left Mulmaster to return to Turmish, Gareth's birthland. On the road to Turmish, they chanced upon Giant's Fist, a small extinct volcano near [[Erlkazar]] that had been home to a clan of [[dwarf|dwarves]] who had long since abandoned the stronghold.	

Gareth believed that Giant's Fist was an ideal location for a home and he convinced Jandi to use her knowledge of warding magic to create impenetrable wards on the mountain. Helgre had tracked Gareth and Ivor to Giant's Fist where she killed Jandi and made it look as though Gareth was responsible. Ivor became Gareth's sworn enemy which is the origin of the animosity between the Jadaren and Beguine merchant clans.
