This is problematic for a few reasons.<br />First, Tavis was married to a [[human]] woman, [[Brianna Burdun]]. Wum is stated to be a [[firbolg]], not a [[half-giant]]. Since firbolgs live about five times longer than humans, it is possible that Tavis remarried a firbolg woman after Brianna died and fathered Wum through her. Or, perhaps Tavis adopted Wum, as he himself had been adopted.<br />However, the source ''also'' states that Tavis had hoped that Wum would assume the [[Alabaster Throne]] upon the former's death. As consort to the queen of [[Hartwick]], Tavis should never have been allowed to sit on the throne. At best, he would have been regent after Brianna's death until ''her'' child came of age. [[Kaedlaw Burdun]] was her firstborn, so the only way that Wum could have assumed the throne was if he was Brianna's child as well ''and'' if Kaedlaw had died, and this brings us back to the first conflict.<br />It could be argued that after Briana's death, Tavis started a new dynasty, but this conflicts with ''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]'', which explicitly states that the current king of Hartsvale in 5{{th}} edition is a member of [[House Hartwick]] in the same line of descent from [[Hartkiller]] as Brianna was, so the line was unbroken.
