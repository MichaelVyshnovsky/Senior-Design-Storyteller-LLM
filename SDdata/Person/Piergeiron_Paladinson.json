        "mainbody": "Piergeiron Paladinson (, leaving him with one daughter, Aleena Paladinstar, who left Waterdeep to explore the planes. \nDue to his position of power in Waterdeep, being above the guild law, he made a lot of enemies, including the Master Mariners Guild.  \nLord Piergeiron maintained strong ties with the royal family of the Moonshae Isles. He was an attendee at the wedding of Queen Alicia Kendrick.\nPiergerions favorite steed was Dreadnought.\nHe wore a set of full plate mail armor, his magical shining shield +1, decorated with a warhammer and golden scales of Tyr atop its head. His holy avenger sword called Clamorour inherited from Piergerions father Athar.\nAnother notable holy avenger sword of his was Halcyon, a beautiful blade decorated with filigreed etchings, extremely effective against doppelgangers.\nPiergeiron was born to Athar, \"the Shining Knight, the Arm of Tyr,\" a famous adventurer, and a paladin whose reputation saw spread throughout the entire Northland. The rumors floated all around the Sword Coast claiming that Athar was once a Lord of Waterdeep, but the truth of the matter was elusive. A lot of people have been saying that Piergeiron was destined for the position of the Lord of Waterdeep himself ever since his childhood.\nPiergeiron believed that he would serve Tyr better not wandering the lands adventuring, but establishing a strong central location. After creating a name for himself with heroic deeds and a career in the City Guard, he gained great favor with then Open Lord Lhestyn. Lord Lhestyn designated the brave paladin as his successor upon the formers death in the , Piergeiron accepted the position of the Open Lord of Waterdeep.\nEven Piergeirons critics quickly came to understand and appreciate the young Lords value. He became beloved by the general populace of Waterdeep for his diligence and ethics.\nPiergeiron was severely wounded in the , when Amril Zoar of the exiled noble family maliciously attacked the Lords of Waterdeep, killing two others at the same time.\nIn the , during the Time of Troubles, a purported avatar of Selûne arrived in Waterdeep. Piergeiron and Khelben Arunsun covertly watched her arrival at the House of the Moon, while discussing the need for caution. The avatar was later invited to a party at Castle Waterdeep, which was attended by Piergeiron and Khelben. Fenn Estelmer introduced Kyriani to Piergeiron, and she shared her concerns. While she spoke more with Khelben, the Dark Army of the Night crashed the party, seeking to kidnap the avatar. Piergeiron ordered the City Guard to stop them, though the avatar took care of them herself. Afterward, Kyriani confronted the avatar, but they fought a spell-battle, only stopped when Piergeiron intervened, commanding even the goddess to restrain herself. He had the City Guard apprehend Kyriani.\nLater, a group of lawyers approached Lord Piergeiron with an offer. The lawyers promised to streamline the handling of civil disputes as these took up increasing amounts of the Lords Courts time. They pushed Piergeiron for an agreement and he unwisely and hastily agreed, signing a contract between the lawyers and the city. Furthermore, Piergeiron received his own attorney. However, the lawyers were more interested in the letter of the law, while Piergeiron simply made rulings based on their recommendations. Khelben hatched a plan to force the lawyers to renege on their contract and evict them from the city.\nHe was noted as being \"well past 50 winters\" at the end of the , but his actual age was unknown.\nIn the , during Halasters Higharvestide, Piergeiron slew Kistarianth the Red when the dragon rose again as a dracolich. As of a a century later, his great feat was celebrated on Kythorn 20 as the Waterdhavian holiday known as Dragondown.\nStill holding the seat of the Open Lord of Waterdeep in the ,, Lord Piergeiron was in the middle of a lavish wedding ceremony to Eidola of Neverwinter (who looked a lot like the lords long-lost love Shaleen), a descendant of the hero Boareskyr. The marriage was to bring prosperity to both Waterdeep and the Boareskyr family by establishing a profitable caravan route to Kara-Tur, crossing the Boareskyr Bridge. In a swirl of conspiracies and murder attempts by ravenous doppelgangers and treacherous members of the Master Mariners Guild, the wedding was interrupted by a cloud of darkness and a group of summoned basal golems who abducted the bride and disappeared with her into the faraway Utter East. Following the events of the failed wedding, Piergeiron fell mysteriously ill to his daughters great distress. Aleena Paladinstar joined the rescue team assembled by Khelben Arunsun to rescue both Eidola and Piergeiron himself.\nIn Tarsakh of the the , Piergeiron, seven of his fellow Lords of Waterdeep, along with other heads of state from across the Heartlands and beyond held council with the Shadovar Prince, Aglarel Tanthul of Thultanthar, to discuss a potential alliance between the returned Netherese city and their new neighbors. The meeting went poorly, due in part to comments and actions made by Masked Lord Brian, but lines of communication between the parties remained open. Despite the diplomatic setback, Prince Aglarel directed Shadovars allies to aid the Army of the North—led by Waterdeeps own Laeral Silverhand—in its fight against the phaerimm, a demonstration good will to Piergeiron and the Masked Lords. Once again, Lord Brian insulted the Shadovar prince, an affront that Piergeiron did not condemn, and one that could not be forgiven by Aglarel. The Shadovar subsequently recalled their forces from the battlefield and refocused their efforts against the phaerimm elsewhere.\nPiergeiron was remained as the Open Lord as of the .\nIn the  Piergeiron the Paladinson died in office of age and ill health, after several assassination attempts at the hands of those increasingly impatient to replace him with their various stooges."
