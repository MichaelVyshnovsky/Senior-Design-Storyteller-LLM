        "mainbody": "Qara was a sorceress from Neverwinter in the midâ€“14 century DR. She attended the Neverwinter Academy, where she received some small amount of wizard training that she ultimately disregarded. She was best known for her travels with the Kalach-Cha.\nQara was impatient and rebellious. Proud and stubborn, Qara liked to do things her way or not at all and found it difficult to concede her will to anothers, though, if she could be convinced of the correct course, she would yield. More often, however, Qara proved insubordinate and hot-tempered to a fault, resulting in her expulsion from the very Academy that her own father had founded, though this may have had more to do with her generally disdainful attitude towards wizards, who learned their magic rather than coming to it naturally as she and other sorcerers did. Her rational complaints gradually turned into a snide derision of wizards as a whole, whom she often saw as weak and deserving of her scorn and wrath. These qualities would often put her at odds with Sand, with whom she shared a deep enmity that was worsened by their headstrong attitudes.\nThough quick to anger, eager to insult, which she was quite good at, or intimidate, and given to dangerous shows of power, Qara was not wholly selfish. For example, although often dismissive of her fellow students at the Academy, she would later pity them when encountering their twisted, undead forms near Old Owl Well. In other cases, Qara showed a great deal of sympathy for others whom she saw as trapped or constrained by tyranny or otherwise obtrusive authority.\nthumb|right|Qara dressed for success.\nDescribed as physically attractive by many around her, Qara had a comely figure with refined tastes in dress, though her hair, which was commonly ruffled and unkempt as a result of Qaras tugging at it in frustration, detracted slightly from her appearance. She had white cheeks, green eyes, and bright red hair. As in all other things, Qaras disposition and attitude shone through her appearance as well, as she would tend to blush brightly when enraged, roll her eyes when irritated, or move her hands excitedly when enticed.\nShe was the child of a powerful mage of some sort who founded the Academy in Neverwinter and presided over it in an authoritative position.\nAt some point, Qara was enrolled in the Neverwinter Academy herself. She felt it was her fathers way of \"getting her out of the way\" though others suggested that Qara only stayed in the Academy so long because of her fathers favoritism. Whatever the case, Qara was indisputably talented, possessing a great deal of power from the beginning of her entrance all the way through her time there.\nQara was aware of her talent for magic and as a result was derisive of her fellow students, though this may have been a reaction to insults from jealous peers, who claimed, along with her instructors, that she exhibited extreme lack of control with her power. For example, Qara reputedly set the Academy stables on fire by accident. This resulted in further derision from the students as well as more condemnations from her teachers, eventually culminating in Qaras decision to leave the Academy, following her subsequent expulsion. Qara would not look back fondly on her Academy days, seeing them as both boring and fruitless.\nIt was shortly after her expulsion from the Academy that the Kalach-Cha first encountered Qara, in the . As the hero was attempting to gain entrance into Blacklake District to meet with Aldanon, they encountered Qara outside of their \"uncle\" Duncan Farlongs tavern, the Sunken Flagon. Qara was about to start a fight with two of her former classmates, one of whom of was Glina, the daughter of Academy Magister Jochris. The Kalach-Cha may have prevented the fight or joined in, but regardless, the incident would reflect badly on Qara who, for her near-destruction of the Flagon, was pressed into work as a barmaid by Duncan, who also pushed her on to the Kalach-Cha to keep her out of the way. Qara initially resented this, though she may have, in time, come to appreciate the opportunity to use her powers without the restrictions of the Academy.\nThe incident also cemented Qaras expulsion from the Academy, though it also led to Glina and her friends expulsion as well, enraging her father Johcris. The students once again attempted to get their revenge on Qara, though this time they were soundly defeated by the sorceress and her new allies. Johcris tried to intimidate Qara into apologizing, while warning her that her recklessness would lead to her end. Disdainful, Qara threw his demand back at him, which caused the wizard to become further incensed.\nIn the end, out of spite, Johcris rashly formed an agreement with Sydney Natale of the Hosttower, promising her open access to Neverwinter for students, disciples, and slaves, in exchange for Qaras eradication. In exchange, Sydney offered to create an animus elemental, a creature formed from the animus or \"life force\" of Qara, for which she required some fragment of Qaras body, which Johcris later obtained a strand of her hair. Sydney created Qaras nemesis, which stalked her throughout the sorceresss travels along the Sword Coast, weakening her during their many encounters.\nWhile this was happening, Qara proved useful in many ways. While argumentative and insubordinate, Qara was truly powerful and eager to demonstrate her abilities whenever possible, making her an excellent ally against the various enemies the Kalach-Cha would face. She may have also offered to fight in the Kalach-Chas place during the Trial by Combat against Lorne Starling, though this offer may not have been accepted.\nEventually, Qaras past caught up with her. During the Kalach-Chas attempts to uncover a way to defeat the seemingly immortal shadow reavers, Sydney Natale laid a trap, claiming to have the Tome of Iltkazar that contained the reavers true names and offering it in exchange for the Kalach-Cha to come with only Qara and the githzerai Zhjaeve. With little choice but to hope Sydney was telling the truth, the Kalach-Cha agreed. It turned out that Sydney had been telling the truth, but she was also bound by contract to kill Qara and any who protected her. She unleashed the animus once again, though this time Qara, Zhjaeve, and the Kalach-Cha were able to kill both Sydney and the summoned animus, though Jalboun of the Two Blades surrendered.\nQara may have continued to travel with the Kalach-Cha until the heros assault on the King of Shadowss fortress within the Mere of Dead Men. During that assault, both her loyalty and Sands would come into question, the animosity between them driving them as much as their loyalty to the Kalach-Cha. Ultimately, one would choose to follow the Kalach-Cha based upon their treatment while the other, more out of spite or fear than anything else, would leave and join Black Garius at the last moment, betraying the rest.\nWhether Qara was the one to betray the Kalach-Cha or Sand is unclear. However, according to Ammon Jerro, she did not survive either way, being ill-prepared for the collapse of the King of Shadowss fortress after his death. As the members of the party fled from the ruin, Qara, if not already killed in the battle between the group and Garius, was crushed by a falling piece of rock, dying instantly.\nQara also had a small weasel familiar named Tamin."
