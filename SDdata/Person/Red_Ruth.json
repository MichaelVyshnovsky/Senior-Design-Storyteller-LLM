        "Activities": "Evil individuals from all over the multiverse went to Red Ruth's lair asking for a [[divination]] or to sample her mystical brews made with blood.",
        "History": "Once Red Ruth managed to corrupt a group of [[dryad]]s in [[Feywild]], by injecting mind-bending mushrooms into the roots of their trees. Their evil caused the now-damned forest to shift into Avernus, where most of the dryads died and the rest turned into a kind of [[banshee]]. Pleased with the result, Red Ruth decided to made her lair there.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Red Ruth wanted to go to the [[Wandering Emporium]] to have a bath after two hundred years."
