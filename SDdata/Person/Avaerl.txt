'''Avaerl of Sembresh''' was a [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], after [[Elminster Aumar]] had foiled a Zhentarim plot to conquer [[High Dale]], [[Manshoon]] sent Avaerl to track and kill the Old Mage. In truth, the High Lord of the Zhentarim was skeptical of Avaerl's chances and also sent [[Zalarth Bloodbrow]] to follow Avaerl and intervene if needed.

Avaerl found Elmninster and [[Sharantyr]] at [[Spellgard]]. He confronted them but was easily killed by Sharantyr.
