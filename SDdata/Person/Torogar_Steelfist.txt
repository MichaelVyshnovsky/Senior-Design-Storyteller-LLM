Torogar Steelfist was a minotaur who served as bodyguard to Arkhan the Cruel.
Torogar was known to be savage. He followed Arkhan to all of his missions.
A fierce and tireless warrior, Torogar was skilled with the use of double scimitars, which he could wield in a mindless rage. He also dealt devastating attacks with his horns.
In addition to his belt of fire giant strength and his gauntlets of flaming fury, Torogar also rode a Devils Ride.
Torogars duties as bodyguard led him to follow Arkhan to his periodic pilgrimages to a monument dedicated to Tiamat near Arkhans Tower in Avernus. He also followed Arkhan to battle whenever necessary.
