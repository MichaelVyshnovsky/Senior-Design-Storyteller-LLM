'''Fonlim''' was a [[gnome]] [[wizard]] who lived in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Like almost all the other students of the [[Neverwinter Academy]], Fonlim was fond of [[Aribeth de Tylmarande|Lady Aribeth]] and was grateful that she didn't blame all the wizards the spreading of the [[Wailing Death]] and other events in Neverwinter and.

Fonlim had doubts about ever reaching graduation, and the memory of [[Herban]]'s angry shouts during basic training continued to haunt his nightmares.

==Relationships==
During the graduation ceremonies in 1372 DR, Fonlim was chatting with other students, [[Kiki]] and [[Deelin]].

==History==
Deelin was a student of the Neverwinter Academy. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, she finished her studies and was one of the eight students, among whom was the future [[Hero of Neverwinter]], present at the graduation ceremony of that year. During the ceremony led by Lady Aribeth, the Academy was attacked. He fought against the mysterious [[mage]]s in the Graduation Chamber. It is not known if Fonlim survived the attack.
