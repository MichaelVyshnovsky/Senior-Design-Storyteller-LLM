'''Su-to''' was a [[samurai]] [[ghost]] actor on [[Tsuta Island]] off the coast of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] in [[Wa]].

==History==
Around [[1148 DR]], Su-to was the greatest [[noh]] actor and dramatist of Wa. Thanks to his popularity, he asked the [[shogun]] to build a [[Su-to Theater|theater]] for himself on Tsuta Island of the coast of the Fochu Peninsula. The shogun granted this to Su-to and he gathered the best actors of Wa.

However, a massive undersea earthquake caused the island to sink, killing Su-to and the entire company.

Around [[1248 DR]], however, some of Su-to's admirers in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] caused the island to resurface with the theater intact, and Su-to and his company of players got to live again as [[ghost]]s. From then on, Su-to performed monthly for the gods.
