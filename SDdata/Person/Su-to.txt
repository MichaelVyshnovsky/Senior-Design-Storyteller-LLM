Su-to was a samurai ghost actor on Tsuta Island off the coast of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa.
Around 1148 DR, Su-to was the greatest noh actor and dramatist of Wa. Thanks to his popularity, he asked the shogun to build a theater for himself on Tsuta Island of the coast of the Fochu Peninsula. The shogun granted this to Su-to and he gathered the best actors of Wa.
However, a massive undersea earthquake caused the island to sink, killing Su-to and the entire company.
Around 1248 DR, however, some of Su-tos admirers in the Celestial Bureaucracy caused the island to resurface with the theater intact, and Su-to and his company of players got to live again as ghosts. From then on, Su-to performed monthly for the gods.
