'''Kalor Ovrabek''' was a [[Zhent]] [[half-elf]] spy in the service of Lord [[Orgauth]] of [[Zhentil Keep]], who operated in [[Halfhap]] around [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Kalor was a handsome man with a rakish cast to his features.

==Personality==
Kalor was a clever and clear-sighted man, who performed his work competently and attentively. He was very loyal to Lord Orgauth, in part thanks to his work rebuilding Zhentil Keep.

==Possessions==
Kalor was very fond of [[magical item]]s, and was very well equipped. He carried a ''+3 [[shortsword]]'' and a '' +3 [[dagger of venom]]'', and wore ''[[bracers of defense]]''. He also used a ''+2 [[ring of protection]]'' and a ''[[wand of secret door and trap location]]''. As his role involved much travel, he also had a light [[riding horse]].

==Activities==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he served under [[Mirande Palemedes]] as part of her team of spies. They gathered information on [[Cormyr]]'s border defenses and opportunistically attacked [[adventurer]]s in the wilderness of the [[Stonelands]] to acquire more loot.

==Relationships==
As part of their cover story in Cormyr, Kalor and Mirande pretended to be an innocent married couple. They loved this setup so much, they acted as a couple even when in private.
