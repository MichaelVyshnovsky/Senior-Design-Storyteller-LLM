'''Caracatl''' was the high priest of [[Tezca]] in [[Nexal]] in [[Maztica]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Around [[1352 DR]], after a series of portents, [[Naltecona]] gathered all the high priests of Nexal and asked for the gods' wishes. Naltecona first asked Caracatl, who said that his god asked for more sacrifices.
