'''Xax Chung''' was a male [[Hare hengeyokai|hare]] [[hengeyokai]] [[bushi]] and the hero of the city of [[Koje]] in [[Koryo]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Xax was found wounded in the form of a [[hare]] by [[Korax (shukenja)|a wandering shukenja]], who healed him. However, the [[shukenja]] also placed a ''[[geas]]'' on Xax, commanding that he must look after and protect the people of the city of Koje until [[Jisziat's Tower]], a prominent local landmark, was "cast to the ground". Xax could not be free until this came about.

In the course of this duty, Xax saved Koje from a giant [[dragon turtle]] and slew the [[tengu]] [[Kwi'asp]]. For his efforts, he was feted as the "hero of Koje". He was also said to have "tamed" the witch [[Zartalla]], whom he later married.

By [[1357 DR]], Xax and Zartalla had settled down and raised a family, but his ''geas'' remained unfulfilled.

Finally, many years later, when Xax was an old man, Koje was assaulted by a [[dragon]], who tore down Jisziat's Tower. Xax battled the dragon, and died defending his adopted city. Revealed to be a hare hengeyokai at the end, he remained known as the hero of Koje.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}}

==Personality==
In the fulfillment of his ''geas'', Xax had to maintain the pretense of being a [[human]] to the people of Koje, though he would prefer to get away into the woods to be with other hengeyokai. He never ate meat, a habit that was noticed but not questioned. Few suspected the truth until his death.

==Description==
In human form, Xax was of medium build and had wide brown eyes as befitted a hare. He typically wore around his neck a brass chain bearing the symbol of the [[god of the warren]], but its meaning was unknown or obscure to those who saw it.

==Skills==
Xax had reflexes that were lighting fast, lending him great skill at arms.

==Relations==
Xax was married to Zartalla, and they had children.

==Residence==
Xax dwelled at a large cattle ranch about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) north of Koje, together with his family and servants.
