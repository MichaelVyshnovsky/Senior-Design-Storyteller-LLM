Sampson was the blacksmith in the town of Moonhaven sometime during or before the late 15 century DR.
Sampson had one known apprentice, Dida, who regularly burned her arms while working the forge and bellows.
At some point, Sampson developed gout, likely from having a poor diet. The towns healer treated the malady with a tincture of autumn crocus and recommended the blacksmith refrain from eating red meat and ale.
