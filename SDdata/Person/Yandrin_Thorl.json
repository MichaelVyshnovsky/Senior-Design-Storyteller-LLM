        "mainbody": "Yandrin Thorl was a wizard in High Dale in 1370 DR.\nOne time as a demonstration, Yandrin unleashed a meteor swarm over a pirate isle in the Sea of Fallen Stars, totally destroying it.\nYandrin protected the peace of his dale against all invaders, from Archendale, Sembia, and Cormyr. Yandrin resided in a tower near Highmoon. Visitors needed to deal with a kind of unseen servant that asked them to write their request on a book and leave if Yandrin was interested, in three days he would contact them. If someone tried to sneak inside, they usually found themself teleported naked into the Thunder Peaks.\nOnce a year every year on the same date Yandrin played talis card games with Elminster Aumar."
