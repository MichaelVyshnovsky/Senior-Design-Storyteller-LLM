'''Dorhum''' was a [[dwarf]] [[fighter]] that volunteered to join the to-be [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==Possessions==
The fighter donned [[chain mail]] and a dwarven [[helmet]]. He fought with an axe, and brought [[ration]]s and a [[potion of healing]] with him.

==History==
The young dwarf first resided with his trouble-stricken clan. When a group of adventurers ventured down to slay [[Xanathar]], Dorhum volunteered to join them, and search out his clan's captive prince, [[Keirgar]].
