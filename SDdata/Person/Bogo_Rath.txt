'''Bogo Rath''' was an [[evil]] [[wizard]] who was affiliated with the [[Night Masks]] and [[Castle Trinity]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bogo was a minor wizard in the Night Masks but later quit the thieves' guild and entered into the service of the powerful wizard [[Aballister Bonaduce]], leader of Castle Trinity.

In [[1361]], when Aballister decided to have [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] killed, Bogo Rath enlisted the help of his former fellows, for the right price, and assisted them by providing magical support. He proved himself very nefarious, twisting [[Kierkan Rufo]] in evil ways and manipulating him into causing the death of [[Avery Schell]], Cadderly's father figure. It was all in vain, however, and Cadderly and his friends in the end slew all the Night Mask [[Assassin|assassins]], with Bogo being killed by [[Ivan Bouldershoulder]] during his escape attempt.<ref>
