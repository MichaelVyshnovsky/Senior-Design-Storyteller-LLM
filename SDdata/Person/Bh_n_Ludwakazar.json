        "History": "Bhún once lived with the rest of his clan in the [[Earthspur Mountains]], acting as custodian of the mystical [[Chamber of Falling Stones]]. The recent mining excavations alarmed them. Bhún had a conflict with his brother, King [[Iorn Ludwakazar]], and was subsequently exiled.\n\nAfter that, he went to Mulmaster where he gained fame as the '''Stone Dwarf''' in gladiator matches.\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], an adventuring party approached him in order to learn about the mines and he told them his history, asking them to also send a letter of reconciliation to his brother."
