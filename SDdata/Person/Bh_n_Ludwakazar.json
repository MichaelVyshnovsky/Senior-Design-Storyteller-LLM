The recent mining excavations alarmed them. Bhún had a conflict with his brother, King Iorn Ludwakazar, and was subsequently exiled.\nAfter that, he went to Mulmaster where he gained fame as the Stone Dwarf in gladiator matches.\nIn 1491 DR, an adventuring party approached him in order to learn about the mines and he told them his history, asking them to also send a letter of reconciliation to his brother."
