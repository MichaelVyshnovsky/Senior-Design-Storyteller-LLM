Shaloon Farain was a cleric of Mask in Telflamm in 1370 DR and a Proven Sister of the Shadowmasters.
Shaloon was an enthusiastic and sly young woman. She was familiar with many of the Proven and common guild members and, with no remorse, she helped them with her powers.
Shaloon was born to a festhall employee in Telflamm. (Unknown to most save the highest members of temple of Mask, this woman was also the younger sister of Keshna Finlothleer.) Later in life, she entered the church of Mask. Usually, her superiors assigned her to work with the Shadowmasters members.
