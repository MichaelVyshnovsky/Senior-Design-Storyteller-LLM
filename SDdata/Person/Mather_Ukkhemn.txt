Mather Ukkhemn was a merchant, slaver, and a member of the Knights of the Shield from Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Mather was an arrogant and egotistical individual.
He was known to be fat.
Mather was a merchant with a sideline in slavery. He sometimes visited Waterdeep for business of one form or another. He served the leading Knight, First Shield Lord Inselm Hhune.
In Flamerule of the , Mather dared to stay at the Yawning Portal inn with a pair of slaves, the boys Harel and Tymos, thus angering its proprietor, Durnan, whod reputedly been a slave himself once and despised the practice. Although Mather promised the boys were working for him of their own free will, their fear and their scars were apparent to Durnan and other patrons. The Lords of Waterdeep were already aware of Mathers cruel trade, thanks to Sammereza Sulphontiss research, and this discovery gave them cause to banish him. Durnan had Mather removed from Waterdeep and gave the boys new jobs as stablehands. From that time on, Mather was forced to adopt a low profile in his visits to the city.
For a long time, he had tried to convince fellow Knights to put one of their own as one of the Lords of Waterdeep. Finally, Inselm Hhune revealed to Mather the name of a probable Masked Lord of Waterdeep Nindil Jalbuck. However, Bly Ruldegost, Mathers superior in Waterdeep, forbade him to act against Nindil and attempt to replace him. and, subsequently, Nindil was secretly killed and replaced by the greater doppelganger Hlaavin early in the . Afterward, Mather grew terrified that Bly or Hhune would discover his treasonous act and punish him for it.
