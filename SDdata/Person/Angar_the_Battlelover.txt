'''Angar the Battlelover''' was a [[human]] [[adventurer]], [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]], and co-leader of the [[Emerald Swords]] company.

==Personality==
Angar was a short-tempered man who did not tolerate dissent or disobedience, potentially reacting with lethal violence towards insubordination.

==Abilities==
As a cleric of Tempus, Angar was granted an array of [[Divine magic|divine]] spells and abilities. Despite his aggressive nature, he focused on spells that supported his allies and kept them alive.

==Possessions==
Angar bore an enchanted [[longsword]] in battle, and wore [[plate mail]] and a ''[[phylactery of long years]]''. He also carried a ''[[rod of resurrection]]'' and several vials of ''[[holy water]]''.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], he and the Emerald Swords were guests at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. They conspired to kidnap Lord [[Partic Thistle]] and hand him over to [[Zhentil Keep]] for questioning, and had [[Xixis]] the [[doppelganger]] impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, [[Gandegar Armstrong]] had [[Haridyn Storm]] kill Xixis and act as a dead Lord Thistle instead. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.
