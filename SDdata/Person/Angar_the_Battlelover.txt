Angar the Battlelover was a human adventurer, cleric of Tempus, and co-leader of the Emerald Swords company.
Angar was a short-tempered man who did not tolerate dissent or disobedience, potentially reacting with lethal violence towards insubordination.
As a cleric of Tempus, Angar was granted an array of divine spells and abilities. Despite his aggressive nature, he focused on spells that supported his allies and kept them alive.
Angar bore an enchanted longsword in battle, and wore plate mail and a phylactery of long years. He also carried a rod of resurrection and several vials of holy water.
In 1369 DR, he and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis and act as a dead Lord Thistle instead. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.
