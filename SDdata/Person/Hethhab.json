        "History": "Despite being the incarnation of a god, Hethhab kept this secret in order to avoid a personality cult centered on him. He became famous as a slayer of monsters and so the vizier [[Rezim]] appointed him as Defender of the Eastern Way, a very dangerous position. The fact that Hethhab was still alive concerned Rezim, who did not knew his true identity."
