        "mainbody": "Hethhab was the current incarnation of Anhur in Mulhorand in 1357 DR.\nHethhab was the protector of the eastern sections of Mulhorand. He wandered with six disguised divine minions of Anhur.\nDespite being the incarnation of a god, Hethhab kept this secret in order to avoid a personality cult centered on him. He became famous as a slayer of monsters and so the vizier Rezim appointed him as Defender of the Eastern Way, a very dangerous position. The fact that Hethhab was still alive concerned Rezim, who did not knew his true identity."
