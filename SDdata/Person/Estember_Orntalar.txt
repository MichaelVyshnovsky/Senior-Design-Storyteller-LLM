'''Estember Orntalar''' was a priest of [[Oghma]] of the [[Domes of Reason]] temple in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].

''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], Orntalar held the position of High Loremaster Librarian at the Domes, but was engaged in an aggressive power struggle with fellow priests to succeed the missing Patriarch, [[Cullen Kordamant]], and become leader of the [[Orthodox Church of Oghma]]. Orntalar was apparently set to win this position.

:''As the Orthodox Church holds that the position of Patriarch cannot be filled because Kordamant still occupies it, it seems more likely that Orntalar seeks a lesser title that still allows full authority over the Orthodoxy.''
