Filro the Forgotten was a drow who lived alone in the Underdark in a region beneath the Sword Coast.
Filro set himself up in a little makeshift hovel in a rocky outcropping, accessible by the massive branch of a nearby sussur tree. There, he kept a simple bedroll and a stack of books.
He carried with him a simple quarterstaff and several spell scrolls. More notably, however, he carried one of the three pieces of the powerful magic staff â€“ Mourning Frost.
Filro kept along with him a quartet of hook horror guardians.
Sometime in or before the , Filro was among the three drow who began to search out the legendary Adamantine Forge in the Underdark underneath the Western Heartlands, to the point of obsession. At one point in his search, Filro was forsaken by his companions, Xargrim and Dhourn BaTol, and was left to die. A pack of hook horrors found the lost drow man and fed him gnomish flesh, nursing him back to health. By 1492 DR, Filro lost his sanity and lived as a hermit alongside his hook horror pack.
