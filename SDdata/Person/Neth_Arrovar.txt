Neth Arrovar was the priest who oversaw the temple of Bane in Kzelter during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Despite being in charge of Tyrants Hope Temple, Neth didnt spend all his nights there. He instead claimed the best home of the village as his residence when the Knights of the Black Gauntlet conquered it.
Neth possessed a magical suit of armor, as well as a magical morningstar.
