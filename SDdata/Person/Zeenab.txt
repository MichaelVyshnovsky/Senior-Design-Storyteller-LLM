'''Zeenab''' was a vizier in the service of [[Amakim ibn Issad]] in [[Zakhara]] during the 5th century [[DR]].

==History==
Zeenab, according to [[Azaltin ibn Issad]]'s account of the history of [[Al-Anwahr]] in ''[[The Kingdom of Lions]]'', was able to sway Amakim to do what he wished. Azaltin believed that Zeenab convinced his brother that he had become some kind of [[undead]] monster, launching a brief civil war that would result in the destruction of much of the city.
