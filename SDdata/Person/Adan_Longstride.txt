'''Adan Longstride''' was an ambassador to the [[goblin]] realm of the [[Kingdom of Nix]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

In the midst of council, Adan Longstride maligned the good will of the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]], who had been appointed emissary to Nix with the task of negotiating peace terms with the king of the goblins. In accordance with goblin custom, they had to resolve their disagreement in trial by combat, which they did through [[bloodforge]] battle.
