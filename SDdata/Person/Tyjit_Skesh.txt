Tyjit Skesh was a guard on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Tyjit was quick to anger and quicker to use her two blades, but was also honest to a fault. She did not tolerate bullying, and always explained the cause of her anger in the hopes that peoples attitude would change.
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons inÂ 1489 DR Tyjit acted as a guard for a great caravan that, unbeknownst to her, was full of agents of the Cult of the Dragon transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
