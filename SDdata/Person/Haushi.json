        "mainbody": "Sheikh '''Haushi''' was the head of the [[Ruwaldi]] tribe of [[Bedine]] in the years leading up to the early 1360s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Haushi represented the Ruwaldi at the great meeting of Bedine tribes at [[Elah'zad]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. He was quite skeptical of the display the sheikhs witnessed, that of the exiled spellcaster [[Ruha]] channeling the voice of the [[Mother of Waters]].\n\nAll the warriors of the Ruwaldi tribe were murdered in their sleep by [[Zhentarim]] agents utilizing magic to make themselves invisible. Although there were no direst witnesses, it was presumed that Sheikh Haushi was among them."
