'''Ronatsinaderin''' was an ancient [[green dragon]] who lived in [[Estagund]]. By the year {{yearlink|1372}}, he had died of old age.While he is listed as "slain by Kinase Bronihim" in the Roll Call of Dragons, the novel where he is drawn from specifically denies that fact. While ordinarily, web enhancements are considered of higher priority than novels, given Ronatsiderin exists exclusively in the novel and the web enhancement only collates information from such, this article is written under the assumption that the web enhancement is in error, rather than a retcon. In a conversation with the [[blue dragon]] [[Gerinvioch]], the wizard [[Kinase Bronihim]] pretended to have slain him; Gerinvioch pretended to have been injured in a fight with him.
