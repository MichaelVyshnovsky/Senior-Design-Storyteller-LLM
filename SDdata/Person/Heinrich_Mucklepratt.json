        "Activities": "Heinrich was a scribe charged with keeping records for goods and raw materials passing through Harloch on [[Snowdown Ride]]. He spent his free time studying books on the history of the Moonshae Isles. He stumbled across a book in a shop in [[Westphal]] impaled with a strange horn. The book discussed the mysterious [[Moonwell]]s found throughout the Moonshae Isles. When he removed the horn from the book a jolt of energy shot through his body. Ever since then he was obsessed with Moonwells and finding one. He learned about the existence of a single Moonwell on Snowdown and wished to visit the sacred place. His darker thoughts wondered what would happen if he tossed the strange horn into the Moonwell."
