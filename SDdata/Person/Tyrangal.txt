Tyrangal, or Gaulauntyr, was a copper dragon who lived in a large, heavily warded mansion in an abandoned section of Ormpetarr, in the guise of a human female.
In her copper dragon form, Tyrangal had broad bat-like wings, teeth as long as a mans forearm, and shiny copper-colored scales as smooth as polished glass. While in human form she was taller than average for the race and had copper-colored skin, round golden eyes, and long metallic auburn hair that ran down to her knees.
Tyrangal knew a wide variety of psionic powers, which she used as though she was an egoist. Her known psionic powers included the following
body adjustment, claws of the bear, conceal thoughts, daze, dimension door, displacement, ego whip, empathy, false sensory input, far hand, finger of fire, glorytongue, id insinuation, knock, mental barrier, mind blast, mind thrust, missive, my light, psychic crush, psychofeedback, remote viewing, thought shield, tower of iron will, unseen servant, and verve.
The most notable of these powers was glorytongue, the namesake of her more familiar nickname, which she used alongside remote viewing and unseen servant to steal gems and magic items from others.
While in her human form Tyrangal typically wore a rust-colored, silk robe that was embroidered with runes.
Tyrangal was a friend and mentor to the rogue Duvan.
Tyrangal was known as Gaulauntyr prior to the Spellplague.
