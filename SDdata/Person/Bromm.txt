'''Bromm''' was, together with his twin brother [[Harnoth]], one of the Twin Kings of [[Citadel Adbar]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were the sons of the famous [[Harbromm]].

==History==
During the [[orc]] and [[drow]] invasion in the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Bromm and his brother were tricked by the [[half-drow]] [[Doum'wielle Armgo]] when she posed as an envoy of the [[Moonwood]]. Bromm and a dwarf army were led to an ambush where all the dwarves were killed and the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]], ridden by [[Tiago Baenre]], slew Bromm with its cold [[dragon breath|breath]].
