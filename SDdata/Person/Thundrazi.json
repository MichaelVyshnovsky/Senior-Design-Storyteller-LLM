        "mainbody": "Thundrazi () was a Red Wizard of Thay and a Harper spy in Mulmaster.\nThundrazi usually spoke only in brief and curt sentences. She had a soft side for the young of all species. She tried to maintain her cover, but in case of danger to children, she did not care if she was exposed.\nThundrazi worked with the Hawks, the secret police of Mulmaster, and infiltrated the local embassy of Thay. \nIn 1491 DR, she was at Astrid Sajs estate during an uprising by Elemental Evil cultists, so Mistress Saj provided her with an adventuring party as an escort to return to the embassy."
