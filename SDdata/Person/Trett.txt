'''Trett''' was a merchant during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==History==
Trett, during one of his travels in [[1489 DR]], acquired a necklace made from a [[blue dragon]] tooth. She decided to sell it to the [[Ironhanded]], [[Phlan]]'s Ironworkers' Guild. He met [[Yanna Hammerbound]], a high-ranking member of Ironhanded, at the [[Madame Freona's Tea Kettle]] for an exchange. However, a ''[[lightning bolt]]'' spell from inside the item hit Trett. The situation was resolved by adventurers hired by [[Buhrell Caah]], who wanted the item in order to neutralize it. Trett presumably survived.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|24-25}}
