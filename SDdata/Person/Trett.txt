Trett was a merchant during the Tyranny of Dragons.
Trett, during one of his travels in 1489 DR, acquired a necklace made from a blue dragon tooth. She decided to sell it to the Ironhanded, Phlans Ironworkers Guild. He met Yanna Hammerbound, a high-ranking member of Ironhanded, at the Madame Freonas Tea Kettle for an exchange. However, a lightning bolt spell from inside the item hit Trett. The situation was resolved by adventurers hired by Buhrell Caah, who wanted the item in order to neutralize it. Trett presumably survived.
