        "mainbody": "'''Oliver Tefoco''' was the proprietor of [[Beehive Goods and Wares]] general store in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''What're you after, friend? Got grub, potions, a few nice vintages. Best stock up now before someone clears me out to fill their larder.''|Oliver Tefoco}}",
        "Description": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Oliver appeared to be a middle-aged [[human]] man with a light skin tone and a wild head of curly dark brown hair and bushy mutton-chops. He had brown eyes and wore a [[monocle]] over his left eye. He was known for his tasty home cooking.",
        "Relationships": "He had a spouse, [[Kroyce Tefoco]], and a large family. Their two youngest children, [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]] and [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]], lived with them above the shop. His oldest child, [[Bubbles Tefoco]], lived in the [[Stonyeyes]] district of the city with her family and the newborn [[Dorimara]], while[[Crowell Tefoco|Crowell]] and [[Thegglis Tefoco|Thegglis]] traveled with merchant caravans along the [[Sword Coast North]], and [[Dariel Tefoco]] served as a [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary. Oliver's kids, [[Blunce Tetoco]] and [[Harvel Tefoco]] were amongst the most recently approved applicants to join the Flaming Fist in [[1492 DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened the Gate's safety, Oliver's family were forced to leave the city for their own safety, traveling to Kroyce's family in [[Beregost]]. Kroyce asked Oliver to close the store and join the family in Beregost, in Uncle [[Sternwell]]'s shed, but Oliver refused. All through the [[Absolute crisis]], Beehive remained abuzz but Oliver struggled to make ends meet. During that time, [[Nortale's Hostel]], a shelter for refugees, asked Oliver for any supplies he would be willing to donate. In turn, Beehive Goods and Wares's own supplier, [[Durinbold & Oathoon]], Provisioners, suspended deliveries of food and dry goods until trade caravans could enter the Gate."
