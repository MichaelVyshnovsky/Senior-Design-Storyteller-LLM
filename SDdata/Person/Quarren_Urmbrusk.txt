Quarren Urmbrusk was the lord of House Urmbrusk in Waterdeep until 1476 DR.
Quarren was the lord of Urmbrusk, a house known for providing moneylending and land-buying services to many merchants and temples.
In 1476 DR, he abandoned his duty in order to go on adventure. He granted control of the House to his sister Lestra Urmbrusk and also granted her the custody of his son, Rutherford Urmbrusk. Quarren then gathered an adventuring party and went into Undermountain.
However, Lestra bribed Quarrens companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon. Nobody of that group ever returned. However, in 1479 DR, a voice like Quarrens started whispering Rutherfords ears.
