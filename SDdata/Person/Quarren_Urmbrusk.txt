'''Quarren Urmbrusk''' was the lord of House [[Urmbrusk]] in [[Waterdeep]] until [[1476 DR]].

==Activities==
Quarren was the lord of Urmbrusk, a house known for providing moneylending and land-buying services to many merchants and temples.

==History==
In 1476 DR, he abandoned his duty in order to go on adventure. He granted control of the House to his sister [[Lestra Urmbrusk]] and also granted her the custody of his son, [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]]. Quarren then gathered an adventuring party and went into [[Undermountain]].

However, Lestra bribed Quarren's companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon. Nobody of that group ever returned. However, in [[1479 DR]], a voice like Quarren's started whispering Rutherford's ears.
