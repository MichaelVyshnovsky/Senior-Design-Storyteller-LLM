        "History": "Gerak lived in the small village of [[Fairelm]] in [[shadovar]]-dominated Sembia with his wife [[Elle]].\n\nHe was conscripted into some of the Shadovar's wars against [[Cormyr]] but always went back.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Elle announced to Gerak that she had finally become pregnant. Therefore he decided to go to hunt for his growing family.\n\nWhen he went back Gerak found all Fairelm's inhabitants slaughtered and Elle with a [[curse]] upon her. It was the works of [[Sayeed]] and [[Zeeahd]].\n\nLater arrived to help [[Vasen Cale]] and his squad and [[Orsin]].\n\nAfter witnessing the corruption and the death of Elle, Gerak decided to join Vasen's party hoping to have vengeance."
