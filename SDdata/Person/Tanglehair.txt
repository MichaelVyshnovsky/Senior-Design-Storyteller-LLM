Tanglehair was a deep gnome in Zortagra during the late 1480s DR.
She was captured with her fellows by duergar in the mid-1480s DR and put to work in the recently conquered city of Zortagra. Five years later, Tanglehair noticed the madness spreading among the duergar and led a group of captives to escape the chaos.
