'''Barcero''' was a [[shadovar]] wizard from [[Sembia]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, from his spies Barcero discovered that [[Imani]], a sage from [[Turmish]] residing at [[Hap]], had managed to steal the ''[[Diamond Staff of Chomylla]]'' from the powerful [[dracolich]] [[Dretchroyaster]]. Thus he hired the [[Zhentarim]] warlord [[Phoedele]] to steal the Staff from Imani.

However, Phoedele decided to betray Barcero and went in search of the [[Uvaeren]] treasures for herself.

Meanwhile, Barcero and some of his [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] minions were waiting for the Staff at the ruined [[Sandersal Manor]].

==Personality==
Barcero was a lazy and cowardly man who considered himself a genius. He would do anything to avoid physical fatigue. However, Barcero had a quick mind and was an ambitious schemer.
