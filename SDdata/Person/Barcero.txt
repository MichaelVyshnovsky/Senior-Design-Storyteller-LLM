In the , from his spies Barcero discovered that Imani, a sage from Turmish residing at Hap, had managed to steal the Diamond Staff of Chomylla from the powerful dracolich Dretchroyaster. Thus he hired the Zhentarim warlord Phoedele to steal the Staff from Imani.
However, Phoedele decided to betray Barcero and went in search of the Uvaeren treasures for herself.
Meanwhile, Barcero and some of his shadar-kai minions were waiting for the Staff at the ruined Sandersal Manor.
