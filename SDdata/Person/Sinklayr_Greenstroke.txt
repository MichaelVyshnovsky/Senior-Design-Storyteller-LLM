Sinklayr Greenstroke was a human druid of Mielikki and a member of the Druids of Tall Trees in the High Forest in the early-to-mid-14 century DR.
At one time leading the order as Grand Druid, Sinklayr later retired and by 1358 DR and through 1370 DR he still dwelt in the Tall Trees region with his fellows. He was succeeded by Uthgang Jyarl.
By 1374 DR, Sinklayr was still a member of the Tall Trees circle and passed his days wandering through the forest.
Sinklayr was one of the few to know the secret identity of the Druid Dragon Gildenfire.
