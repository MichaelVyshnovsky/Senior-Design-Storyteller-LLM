'''Sinklayr Greenstroke''' was a [[human]] [[druid]] of [[Mielikki]] and a member of the [[Druids of Tall Trees]] in the [[High Forest]] in the early-to-mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At one time leading the order as Grand Druid, Sinklayr later retired and by [[1358 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]] he still dwelt in the [[Tall Trees]] region with his fellows. He was succeeded by [[Uthgang Jyarl]].

By [[1374 DR]], Sinklayr was still a member of the Tall Trees circle and passed his days wandering through the forest.

==Relations==
Sinklayr was one of the few to know the secret identity of the Druid Dragon [[Gildenfire]].<ref >
