'''Kalarzim''' was the vizier of [[Pharaoh]] [[Horustep III]] in [[Mulhorand]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In addition to advising the pharaoh, Kalarzim was the head of the [[Church of Horus-Re]] and leader of the priesthood during this time. He had much damage to repair caused by the previous man to hold his office, [[Rezim]].
