Cain was a male human of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Cain was a performer in the Blacklake District.
Cain was a famous musician of Neverwinter. He allowed less-skilled musicians to play, only to humiliate them for their poor skill in performing.
If the Kalach-Cha gained entrance to Blacklake, then Cain would embarrass one of the performers. The Kalach-Cha could choose act in his performance, by repeating his tones, either with honest skill or having Grobnar Gnomehands repeat the tones. After each successful performance, the Kalach-Cha could impress the audience or insult Cain. Furthermore, Qara could make fireworks, Sand could insult Cain, or Grobnar could play a duet with the Kalach-Cha in the final performance. Cain would be surprised and give them a lute. If the Kalach-Cha failed, they could attack Cain with fire and get the lute back.
