'''Garthond Shessair''' was an [[archmage]], taught by [[Jhavanter]]. He was a foe of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and the father of [[Shandril Shessair]].

==Activities==
He was an enemy of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Relationships==
His master in [[the Art]] was [[Jhavanter]]. He eventually married with [[Dammasae]], and they had a child, [[Shandril Shessair]].{{cite web/Women that Rock in Our Novels}}{{Cite web/Shandril and Narm, Heroes of Spellfire}} This was unknown to [[Elminster]].

==History==
Garthond and his master Jhavanter fought the Cult of the Dragon numerous times in Sembia and its near regions. Through that time, Garthond dwelt in the [[Tower Tranquil]]. He continued to thwart Cult schemes and survive their attacks; in one of his ambushes upon a caravan of the Cult, he rescued Dammasae. The two began to adventure together and eventually married at the temple of [[Mystra]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].

Unknown to Garthond, he had been cursed by the mage [[Erimmator]] of the Cult, who placed a [[balhiir]] in symbiosis with him during a fight, draining his Art. They left for Elturel, where their child was born; they named the girl Shandril. They left Elturel for the East when the child was months old, accompanied by [[Gorstag]], only to find the Cult waiting for them at the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]] near [[Cormyr]]. Garthond perished there,{{cite book/Heroes' Lorebook|111-112}}

==Legacy==
Dammasae, Shandril and Gorstag survived the ambush, but Dammasae died shortly after. Gorstag was left to rescue Shandril.{{cite book/Heroes' Lorebook|111-112}}
