Achreny Ulyeltin was a merchant just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Achreny was a boorish man without trace of civilization about him. He was smelly, vulgar, and utterly without manners.
Around 1489 DR, Achreny attached his two wagons to a great caravan, which unknown to him was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
