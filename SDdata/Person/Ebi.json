        "mainbody": "'''Ebi''' was one of the most powerful [[yakuza]] crime lords in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Ebi's gang operated in the Miyama capital of [[Tamanokuni]], especially in the Bridge District. Ebi led around 350 yakuza for many decades. On the surface, Ebi posed as a successful shipping merchant. His main business was managing gambling houses and he was tolerated and sometimes supported by [[samurai]] of the [[Niwa clan]] in exchange for running honest games inside gambling houses and preventing any samurai from ruining themselves with excessive debts.",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], Ebi's gang came in conflict with the recently arrived and more violent yakuza gang led by [[Musukosan no Hashi]]. They frequently fought in the streets. The situation reached the point that only one of the two gangs could survive."
