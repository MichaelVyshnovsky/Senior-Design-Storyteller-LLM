        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the city of [[Lachom]] became menaced by a gang of fire giants of the Deepwing Mountains. Kinondra's band raided several farms around the city but refrained from attacking Lachom itself. In response, the city's Mayor [[Turien Battlewake]] put out a call for capable adventurers to resolve the giant threat. Unbeknownst to most, Kinondra was hired by a short-term Lord [[Simon Dessino]] of [[Arrabar]] who was attempting to show Lachom that the city needed [[Chondath]]'s protection."
