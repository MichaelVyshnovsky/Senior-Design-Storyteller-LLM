'''Gordis''' was one of the favorite hunting [[hound]]s of the [[Durinbold]] [[patriar]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], who died sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Gordis's sarcophagus was filled to the brim with toy balls and a single ''[[potion of speed]]''.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Pol (houndmaster)|Chief Houndmaster Pol]] was long dead and interred within the Durinbold Mausoleum of the [[Lower City Graveyard]], surrounded by the interred bodies of his favorite beasts, Gordis, [[Rocky]], and [[Zina]]. The trainer and his three dogs ended up as [[ghost]]s that would attack anyone who dared to invade and disturb the Durinbold family tombs. Gordis's sarcophagus was inscribed with: "Fearless Gordis, who would chase any prey and helped bring in our greatest trophies."
