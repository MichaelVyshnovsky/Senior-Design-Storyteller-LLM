By the , Chief Houndmaster Pol was long dead and interred within the Durinbold Mausoleum of the Lower City Graveyard, surrounded by the interred bodies of his favorite beasts, Gordis, Rocky, and Zina. The trainer and his three dogs ended up as ghosts that would attack anyone who dared to invade and disturb the Durinbold family tombs. Gordiss sarcophagus was inscribed with "Fearless Gordis, who would chase any prey and helped bring in our greatest trophies."
