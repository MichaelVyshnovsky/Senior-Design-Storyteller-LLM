Gordis was one of the favorite hunting hounds of the Durinbold patriar family of Baldurs Gate, who died sometime in or before the late 15 century DR.
Gordiss sarcophagus was filled to the brim with toy balls and a single potion of speed.
By the , Chief Houndmaster Pol was long dead and interred within the Durinbold Mausoleum of the Lower City Graveyard, surrounded by the interred bodies of his favorite beasts, Gordis, Rocky, and Zina. The trainer and his three dogs ended up as ghosts that would attack anyone who dared to invade and disturb the Durinbold family tombs. Gordiss sarcophagus was inscribed with "Fearless Gordis, who would chase any prey and helped bring in our greatest trophies."
