Tolmara Hysstryn was a deranged inhabitant of Triboar sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Tolmara managed the Six Windows rooming house. She normally spied on her customers. In a moment of madness, she accidentally caused the death of her husband, Mirak Hysstryn, but forgot about it and lived with his skeleton.
