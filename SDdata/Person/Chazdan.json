        "mainbody": "\"Lord\" '''Chazdan''' was a man from the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 12{{th}} and early 13{{th}} centuries [[DR]].\n\nHe was a former noble of Procampur, but later turned [[pirate]]. He was among the great pirate lord [[Immurk]]'s fleet of 100 pirate ships at [[Dragonisle]]. The fleet broke apart following Immurk's death in the [[1201 DR|Year of Embers, 1201 DR]].\n\nChazdan arose out of this collapse to become a notorious and vicious pirate captain. He cruelly forced his prisoners to drink themselves to death with quarts (0.25 gallons or ~1 liter) of [[:Category:Alcohol|alcohol]]."
