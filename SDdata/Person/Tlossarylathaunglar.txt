Tlossarylathaunglar was a dracolich in the Underdark.
Tlossarylathaunglar was one of the oldest and most fell creations of the Cult of the Dragon.
Once after, he had destroyed many deep gnome cities and many communities of drow, duergar, and dwarves by shattering lake basins in the bedrock above them, Elminster defeated and froze Tlossarylathaunglar in an Underdark lake.
In 1487 DR, Elminster summoned him to Myth Drannor in order to create chaos among the Sembian mercenaries and bound Tlossarylathaunglar to that city.
