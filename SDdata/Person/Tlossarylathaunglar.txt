'''Tlossarylathaunglar''' was a [[dracolich]] in the [[Underdark]].

==History==
Tlossarylathaunglar was one of the oldest and most fell creations of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

Once after, he had destroyed many [[deep gnome]] cities and many communities of [[drow]], [[duergar]], and [[dwarves]] by shattering lake basins in the bedrock above them, [[Elminster]] defeated and froze Tlossarylathaunglar in an Underdark lake.

In [[1487 DR]], Elminster summoned him to [[Myth Drannor]] in order to create chaos among the [[Sembia]]n mercenaries and bound Tlossarylathaunglar to that city.
