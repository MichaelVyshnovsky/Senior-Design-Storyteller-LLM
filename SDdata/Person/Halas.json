        "mainbody": "'''Halas''' was the leader of the political movement known as the [[Heirs of Azure]] as well as a leader among the [[devil]]-worshiping [[Ashmadai]] cult, that arose in [[Helm's Hold]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=D&D.N\">",
        "Description": "At some point in his life Halas became afflicted with a [[spellscar]].<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "Personality": "He was known as being an exceptionally charismatic leader. Despite him having a strong public persona among his followers, Halas was actually motivated by strong feelings of self-hatred over his malady.<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "Relationships": "His hard-liner perspectives stood in stark contrast to those of his fellow cultist [[Meryth Heartwood]], who sought to achieve the same goals by peaceful means.\n\nHalas originally dedicated himself and his cause to the goals of Prophet [[Rohini]]. Despite his dedication some of his more extreme followers felt she did not go far enough with her actions. While originally defiant, Halas remained loyal to Rohini after she revealed herself to be a [[succubus]] of the [[Nine Hells]]. In an act of great hypocrisy, Halas remained by her side in exchange for a great personal boon.<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "History": "For much of his life, Halas lived as a wealthy landowner who lived in the city of [[Neverwinter]].\n\nDuring the 1470s, tensions arose in Helm's Hold between the city's [[spellscarred]] residents and the bigoted \"purebloods\" that treated them as second-class citizens. To combat the bigotry directed at his fellow spellscarred, Halas formed the Heirs of Azure, a political movement that often resorted to violence in order to further their cause.\n\nWhen Prophet Rohini rose to great influence and religious power in Helm's Hold, she easily seduced Halas and conscripted him into the [[Order of the Blue Fire]]. When she revealed herself as a devotee of [[Asmodeus]], Rohini kept Halas' loyalty by offering to curse his spellscar, albeit at the coast of his soul. He agreed to the bargain and took on the name of '''Halas the Pure'''. Using his \"purification\" as a symbol that they could also be healed, Halas took his followers over to Rohini's cause in fell, bolstering the ranks of the [[Ashmadai]].<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]] during the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Halas led a group of Ashmadai into the [[Crypts of the Vigilant Eye]] in order to summon [[devil]]s to help Rohini completely overtake Helm's Hold. He was thwarted in his efforts and ultimately killed by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], who was aided by the [[ranger]] of [[Dassar Truebow]] and [[Helm]]ite ghosts that watched over the crypts.<ref name=D&D.N\" />"
