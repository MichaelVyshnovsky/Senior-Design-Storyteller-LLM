'''Arielimnda''' was the mother of [[Khelben Arunsun]], the first [[Blackstaff]].

==Description==
Arielimnda was a [[human]] [[ranger]] who joined the [[Harpers in Twilight]].

==Relationships==
Arielimnda became the wife of fellow Harper [[Arun Maerdrym]], a [[half-elf]]. The two became the parents of the one who would grow up to be the first Blackstaff.

==Possessions==
Arielimnda fought with a powerful magical [[axe]] called the ''[[Lupinaxe]]'', which could summon a [[dire wolf]] among several other powers. The axe passed into her husband's possession upon her death.

==History==
Arielimnda gave birth to the son who would become Khelben Arunsun on [[Highharvestide]] in the {{YearlinkName|414}}. He was not permitted to take the [[Elf|elven]] family name of [[Maerdrym]], and Arun, within elven tradition, decided to not give the boy a first name either, allowing him to take his own name when he had earned one.

Arielimnda was murdered by the [[vampire]] [[Palron Kaeth]] under unknown circumstances.
