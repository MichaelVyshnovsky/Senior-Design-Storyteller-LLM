'''Theara Gravelthumb''' was a [[duergar]] in the [[Deep Wastes]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Writhing in the Dark|9-10}}
 
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Theara was traveling through the [[myconid]] settlement of [[Sporedome]] when she was attacked and captured by a group of [[githyanki]] servants of the rogue [[mind flayer]] [[warlock]] [[Xicvizt]]. Xicvizt killed her and used her body to house one of its [[intellect devourer]]s in order to use her as a spy in the surrounding settlements.

==Personality==
Theara's mind was no more. The intellect devourer inside her was fanatically loyal to Xicvizt.
