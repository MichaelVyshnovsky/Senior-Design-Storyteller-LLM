Theara Gravelthumb was a duergar in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Theara was traveling through the myconid settlement of Sporedome when she was attacked and captured by a group of githyanki servants of the rogue mind flayer warlock Xicvizt. Xicvizt killed her and used her body to house one of its intellect devourers in order to use her as a spy in the surrounding settlements.
Thearas mind was no more. The intellect devourer inside her was fanatically loyal to Xicvizt.
