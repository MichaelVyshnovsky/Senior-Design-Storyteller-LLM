==Personality==
He was lustful enough to not feel disinclined from his pursuits even after knowing his mind to have been probed.

==Abilities==
He could feel probes into his mind, and had at least one spell that froze a target, or commanded them.

==History==
During the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]],The event is not dated, but must happen between the Simbul's coronation as the Witch-Queen of Aglarond in 1320 DR, and the present time in the story, 1372 DR. Orlugrym was sent on a mission to retrieve something from [[The Simbul]]'s study. On the way there, after feeling his mind probed, he decided to instead take the robes from one of her female apprentices, whom he had spotted; after enspelling her and commanding her to bare herself in his arms, she turned out to be the Simbul herself. She killed him with [[silver fire]].
