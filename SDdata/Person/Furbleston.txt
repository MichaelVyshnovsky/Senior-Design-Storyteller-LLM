==Description==
Furbleston was a [[hin]] man with a light skin tone, brown hair, dark blue eyes, and a splendorous rich servant's outfit, which included an ornate top hat.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Chamberlain Mercer, the man in charge of Lady [[Firelia Jannath]]'s staff, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders. Mercer placed Furbleston, who was assigned serving tasks, [[Bailey]], [[Cyrilla]], [[Jooli]], [[Phubbs]], and Chef [[Marjoram (chef)|Marjoram]] on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.
