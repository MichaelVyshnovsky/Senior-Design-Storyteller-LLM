She along with others of her kind were exiled from the city following its Descent into the Nine Hells.\nShe had purple skin, and light orange-red hair.\nKomira had a unique amulet that was capable of producing floating motes of light.\nShe and her partner Locke had a child together, a girl named Arabella.\nIn the , the Elturian tieflings were outcast and forced to live as refugees across the Sword Coast. Fortunately, they found temporary refuge at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave for a time. The feeling of security the grove provided was short-lived however, as the newly-appointed archdruid Kagha attempted to seal away the tieflings using a powerful ritual.\nWhile at the Emerald Grove, Komira and Lockes daughter Arabella was caught stealing the Idol of Silvanus from the grove, in an attempt to prevent the druids from casting the ritual.  She was taken by Kagha and forced to answer for her crime. Komira, Locke, and several of their friends tried to get Arabella to safety but were turned away by members of the Emerald Enclave."
