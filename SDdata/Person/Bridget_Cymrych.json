        "mainbody": "ridget Cymrych was a Ffolk human princess of Callidyrr on the island of Alaron in the Moonshae Isles in the 7th century DR.\nIn the &mdashduring the reign of High King Embro II of Callidyrr, who was known for seeking peace with the Northmen&mdashPrincess Bridget of Callidyrr was to marry the Northlander prince Scothgar of Rogarsheim, but she and her whole royal entourage vanished on the voyage to Norland. Ffolk and Northmen each blamed the other for the disappearance, which worsened relations between them. \nThat same year, Moonshaes Ffolk arrived on the shores of the Utter East, where they chose to settle.Although there is no explicit connection between these events, the implication is clear that Bridgets entourage was somehow transported from the Moonshaes to the shores of the Utter East. In fact, author Brian R. James borrowed this from an article entitled \"Perilous Portals The Sea Gates\" written by Mark \"Markustay\" Taylor in [http//www.candlekeep.com/compendium/Candlekeep_Compendium-Volume_IX.zip Candlekeep Compendium Volume IX], a fan-written netbook, making it an example of fanon turned canon. Taylors story tells of a pirate who tried to attack Bridgets treasure-laden ships, until a Northlander fleet intervened. Both Ffolk and Northlanders pursued the pirate into a sea portal, before all three were wrecked in a storm on the Great Sea."
