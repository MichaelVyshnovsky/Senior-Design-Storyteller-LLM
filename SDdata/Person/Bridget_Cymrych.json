        "mainbody": "'''Bridget Cymrych''' was a [[Ffolk]] [[human]] princess of [[Callidyrr]] on the island of [[Alaron]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the 7th century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/The Moonshaes}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|621}}&mdash;during the reign of High King [[Embro Cymrych II|Embro II]] of Callidyrr, who was known for seeking peace with the [[Northmen]]&mdash;Princess Bridget of Callidyrr was to marry the Northlander prince [[Scothgar]] of [[Rogarsheim]], but she and her whole royal entourage vanished on the voyage to [[Norland]]. Ffolk and Northmen each blamed the other for the disappearance, which worsened relations between them. \n\nThat same year, Moonshaes Ffolk arrived on the shores of the [[Utter East]], where they chose to settle.<ref group=\"note\">Although there is no explicit connection between these events, the implication is clear that Bridget's entourage was somehow transported from the Moonshaes to the shores of the Utter East. In fact, author [[Brian R. James]] borrowed this from an article entitled \"Perilous Portals: The Sea Gates\" written by Mark \"Markustay\" Taylor in [http://www.candlekeep.com/compendium/Candlekeep_Compendium-Volume_IX.zip ''Candlekeep Compendium Volume IX''], a fan-written netbook, making it an example of fanon turned canon. Taylor's story tells of a pirate who tried to attack Bridget's treasure-laden ships, until a Northlander fleet intervened. Both Ffolk and Northlanders pursued the pirate into a sea ''[[portal]]'', before all three were wrecked in a storm on the Great Sea."
