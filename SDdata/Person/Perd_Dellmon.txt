Perd Dellmon was a farmer during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Perd helped his father Kerbin Dellmon manage a great farm in the valley.
In 1491 DR, the Iceshield orcs attacked many farms around the property. However, Kerbin refused to abandon his farm and go to Yartar and Perd supported his decision, despite fearing for his children. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, the Dellmons managed to defend the farm.
