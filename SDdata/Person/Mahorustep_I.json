He ascended to the throne of pharaoh of Mulhorand in 921 DR, after the former pharaoh Horuseres II was slain by the green dragon Chathuulandroth.\nHis reign came to an end a year later, dyeing in battle against the Red Wizards of Thay during Mulhorands half-hearted attempt to prevent the nation from seceding from the Second Mulhorand Empire."
