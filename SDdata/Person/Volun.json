        "mainbody": "'''Volun''' was a mysterious floating skull, an [[undead]] creature and the ''[[familiar]]'' of [[Caalenfaire]]'s who guided the heroes from [[Phlan]], the [[Veiled Ones]], on their quest to stop the nefarious plans of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[1369 DR]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030409112020/http://www.pool-of-radiance.com/story/chars.htm| title = Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor website | accessdate = 03-04-2003| date = 03-04-2003}}\n{{quote|''Yes, yes, I give you guidance now. Then you can go.''|Volun}}",
        "Personality": "Unlike her master, Volun could communicate freely with clarity of mind unobscured with divinations. She often worked as an interpreter of sorts, covering confusing information dispensed by Caalenfaire. Despite being a floating head, she was snappy and witty. She showed great interest in arcane, her masters' predictions, and music.",
        "Abilities": "In life, Volun was a powerful [[wizard]] and the adversary of Caalenfaire's. The extent of her abilities as an undead skull were unknown.",
        "History": "Volun lived a long time before the advent of the [[Weeping War]] in [[Myth Drannor]]. She was a powerful wizard, one of the [[Speculum]]. Her bitter rival [[diviner]] Caalenfaire eventually gave his mortal life in his obsessive pursuit of secrets. Eventually, Volun ended up a floating enchanted skull, bound to her rival as a familiar. Together, they existed within one of the Speculum's hidden vaults, searching for knowledge of the future.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Caalenfaire and Volun were led by the prophetic ''[[Song of Faer√ªn]]'' performed by the mysterious Bard of [[Kara-Tur]] at the dawn of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The song's fragments and verses reached the undead duo's ears and revealed themselves as the events in the ruins transpired. The song told them about the corruption of the city's ''[[mytha]]'', imprisonment of its keeper, the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s plans of domination of the [[Moonsea]] region. The ''Song'' told them to expect a group of heroes. When heroes from [[Phlan]] made their way through the ruins and came across the undead diviners, Volun realized that her master's divination did not come to pass, they strayed from the Path, and their future became uncertain and clouded in darkness. They became the [[Veiled Ones]]. Volun advised them to search for the allies within the ruins. The prophesied event could still happen if the heroes could find [[Odelinde]] the Golden Serpent, Dwarf Lord [[Harldain Ironbar]], and the [[Sisterhood of Silver Fire|Sisters of Silver Fire]].\n\nEventually, their help aided the Veiled Ones in defeating the Cult, sending [[Kya Mordrayn]] to the [[Abyss]], destroying her [[dracolich]] ally (unbeknownst to the Veiled Ones, another group of adventurers aided them in this by destroying [[Pelendralaar]]'s ''[[phylactery]]''), and restoring the ''mythal'' by creating the new ''[[gem of the weave]]'' and giving it the new guardian, [[Anorrweyn Evensong]].\n\nOnce the order was returned to the ruins, the new verse reached Caalenfaire and Volun from the undead's divination bowl. The song of praise for the Veiled Ones and their successes sang almost 400 years in the past."
