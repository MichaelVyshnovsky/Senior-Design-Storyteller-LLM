        "mainbody": "'''Chien Jang Liang''' was a wandering [[kensai]] in [[Shou Lung]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Chien was a highly talented student of the [[Wang Ho School]] of martial arts in [[Cham Fau]], training under Master [[Wang Ho]]. In {{YearlinkConvert|2606|SY}}, Master Wang Ho rewarded his most promising pupil with instruction in a secret technique called 'the Hands of [[Chan Cheng]],' but while practicing it, Chien inadvertently almost killed his master.\n\nIn penitence, Chien abandoned the school and became a self-imposed outcast. Thereafter, he intended to live as a poor wanderer for the rest of his life. As of {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, he had managed at least a year.",
        "Activities": "He slept in the wilderness and performed only menial labor. He always refused to teach his kensai techniques to others. However he could be convinced to fight to in a good cause.",
        "Personality": "Chien was full of shame and guilt over his mistake.",
        "Relationships": "[[An Ching Wang]], the daughter of his master, loved Chien and followed him into exile so she could look for a way for him to redeem himself and end his guilt,An Ching's lover is Chien Jang Liang in ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' Volume I and [[Yu Fu Tieh]] in ''[[Realmspace]]''. Both of them injured her father in a training accident and both left, with An Ching following. It seems likely that Chien was renamed; indeed, he appears on the same page as [[Yu Fu Fang]] and [[Hu Tieh]]. Regardless, they have different motives, classes, and personality details, so this wiki assumes they are separate characters for clarity, even if it means An Ching clearly has a type."
