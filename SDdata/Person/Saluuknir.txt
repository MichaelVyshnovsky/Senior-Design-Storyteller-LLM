'''Saluuknir''' was an [[Dragon aging|old]] male [[blue dragon]] imprisoned in the ''[[Urn of the Blue Vishap]]''.

==History==
Originally at home in the [[Raurin|Raurin Desert]], Saluuknir was bound to the magical ''Urn'' when its former inmate, the evil [[marid]] [[Merifa of the Pearl Lagoons]], tricked the [[dragon]] into exchanging places.

Centuries later, the magic prison was brought back to its original home, the continent of [[Zakhara]], by a [[corsair]]. Rumor had it that in [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} it was in the possession of the [[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali|master]] of [[Jabal Sarahin|Assassin Mountain]].

==Personality and powers==
Saluuknir was forced by the ''Urn'' to perform three tasks for its owner, while the item gave the dragon some additional magical powers for this purpose in addition to his considerable natural abilities. His prison also prevented Saluuknir from harming its owner or any being when not working towards the fulfillment of the given tasks. Thus the dragon could vent his anger and discomfort about his imprisonment only through threats and blustering. His highest goals were regaining his freedom and vengeance on Merifa of the Pearl Lagoons.
