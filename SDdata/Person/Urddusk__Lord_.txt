'''Lord Urddusk''' was the senior lord of house [[Urddusk]] of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|261}}, Lord Urddusk, alongside Lord [[Haladavar (Lord)|Haladavar]] and Lord [[Malgath (Lord)|Malgath]] solicited the [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]] at his court to reconsider the Opening. They made their argument at swordpoint, which Lord Eltargrim later classed as an "error in judgement". He gained their patience by unveiling the project to raise a ''[[mythal]]''.
