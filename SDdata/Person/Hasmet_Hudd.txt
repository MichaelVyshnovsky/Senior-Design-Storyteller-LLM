Hasmet Hudd was a gold dwarf commoner, displaced by The Absolute, and as a refugee, he sought shelter in Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Hasmet was a gruff-looking, fair-skinned gold dwarf with a stubbly beard and curly light hair. He wore a simple blue jerkin.
In the , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldurs Gate, displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Hasmet Hudd and his brother Giftu Hudd found their way to the city walls and were allowed to enter the Lower City, unlike many other refugees who were refused entrance due to lack of coin or paperwork. Giftu was happy to be protected by the city walls, confident they could withstand the Absolutist siege, but Hasmet thought that Baldurs Gate simply was not secure enough to withstand the Absolutist strike, thinking they shouldve continued moving even further out of the Absolutes way.
