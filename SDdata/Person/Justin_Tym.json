        "mainbody": "Justin Tym, sometimes spelled Justin Tyme,Justins last name and the eponymous company are spelled \"Tym\" in Realms of Magic and Realms of the Underdark. Its spelling gets changed to \"Tyme\" in The Mage in the Iron Mask, perhaps to make the pun on \"just in time\" more obvious, and remains thus for Realms of the Arcane and Realms of Mystery. The next time the publishing company gets brought up again happens two decades later, in Waterdeep Dragon Heist, which retains the original spelling of its first two appearances. was a Waterdhavian entrepreneur and the owner of publishing house Tym Waterdeep Limited. Thanks to his lucrative partnership with the traveling author Volothamp Geddarm, he became known as the most successful publisher in all of Faer√ªn.\nJustin was of tall stature. He once had a full head of hair, of which only a slight fringe remained by the latter half of the 1360s DR.\nAccording to Masked Lord Nymara Scheiron, Justin Tym was considered \"no friend\" of the Lords of Waterdeep, which was possibly precipitated by his publishing of an unauthorized and highly inaccurate biography of Khelben Arunsun, penned by Kaeti Blye.\nAt the time of making his career-defining publishing deal with Volo, Justin thought that he was taking advantage of the gazetteer, whereas his business partner thought the reverse was true.\nWhen Volos Guide to Waterdeep was published by TWL, the review of the Hanging Lantern festhall exposed the activities of the Unseen therein, rendering Volo a major target for that organization. Sometime in the latter months of the , Unseen leader Hlaavin exacted his revenge by disguising himself as Justin, intercepting one of his customary lunch meetings with Volo by rescheduling it from around highsun to the early morning, long before the company owner would be at his office.\nWhen Justins secretary came to work a while later, Hlaavin retook the company owners guise and told her to inform Volo that hed no longer be welcome at TWL, feigning anger at the traveling author standing him up for lunch. He then took off himself, satisfied with his revenge. Later that afternoon, Volo returned to the offices for his advance payment as arranged by the disguised Hlaavin, only to be forcefully escorted off the premises by the similarly deceived secretary. Justin himself only heard of this incident the day after, and being unable to intuit what had happened, he fired yet another in his long line of secretaries."
