Saint Dobla was a saint of the Church of Ilmater. She was considered to be the patron Ilmatari saint of both St. Doblas Abbey and of all women in Calimshan who suffered under oppression in that nation.
In life Dobla was a jhasina, sometime during the First Age of Calimshan. One day she was beaten to death in public by her master. She later was sanctified by the Church of Ilmater and became the namesake of St. Doblas Alley. Due to having been a jhasina in life, some crudely believed that the members of Doblas order engaged in wanton activities. This lead to the development of the insult, "as pure as Doblas dancers," which was used against heroes and paladins to imply that they were lacking in decency and virtue.
