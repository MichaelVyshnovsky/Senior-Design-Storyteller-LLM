'''Saint Dobla''' was a saint of the [[Church of Ilmater]]. She was considered to be the patron Ilmatari saint of both [[St. Dobla's Abbey]] and of all women in [[Calimshan]] who suffered under oppression in that nation.

==History==
In life Dobla was a [[jhasina]], sometime during the [[First Age of Calimshan]]. One day she was beaten to death in public by her master. She later was sanctified by the Church of Ilmater and became the namesake of St. Dobla's Alley. Due to having been a jhasina in life, some crudely believed that the members of Dobla's order engaged in [[prostitution|wanton activities]]. This lead to the development of the insult, "as pure as Dobla's dancers," which was used against heroes and [[paladin]]s to imply that they were lacking in decency and virtue.
