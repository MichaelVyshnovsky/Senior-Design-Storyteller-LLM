'''Ubergast''' was a sage living in [[Amn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Some time before [[1356 DR]], Ubergast observed that the informal handwriting in the untitled [[spellbook|wizard's workbook]] known traditionally as ''[[Briel's Book of Shadows]]'' matched that in a letter from [[Briel]] stating his plan to found a [[Briel's School of the Arcane|school of wizardry]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], preserved in the city's archive. This supported the supposed authorship of the book.
