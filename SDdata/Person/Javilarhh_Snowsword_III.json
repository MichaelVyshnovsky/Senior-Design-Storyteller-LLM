        "mainbody": "'''King Javilarhh \"the Dark\" Snowsword III''' was a king of [[Delimbiyran]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">The existence of Javilarhh III is somewhat vague, as he is referred to without a regnal number, shares his nickname with Javilarhh I, and lived within the same century as Javilarhh II. While the father of Erthaer Javilarhhsson could be an extraordinarily long-lived Javilarhh II, it is considered more likely that there were three Javilarhhs and a reused nickname.",
        "Relationships": "Javilarhh's ancestor was King [[Javilarhh Snowsword II]], and he had several children, with the later King [[Davyd Snowsword]] being his grandson. His youngest son was [[Erthaer Javilarhhsson]]."
