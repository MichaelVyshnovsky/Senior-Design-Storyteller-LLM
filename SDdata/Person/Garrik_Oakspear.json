        "mainbody": "Garrik Oakspear was an elf thief who served as the chief spy of the archmage Halaster Blackcloak during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nGarrik regularly traveled throughout the city of Waterdeep, at least once per week, and collected information for his master Halaster. He patrolled the various levels of Undermountain, stalked trespassing adventurers, and reported upon their various activities to any of the \"Mad Mages\" apprentices. He was granted a personal allowance and was not above taking down lone interlopers to free them of their wealth and possessions.\nHe frequented establishments in Skullport, but made his home in Wyllowwood. His simple abode was filled with many paper sketches of the same woman.\nGarrik was infatuated with the druid Wyllow and felt exceptional joy whenever she paid him the slightest amount of attention. Halaster knew any potential romance was an impossibility, While Wyllow was aware of his feelings, the two maintained a semblance of friendship.\nAmong Garriks possessions were a +2 short sword of quickness, a wand of flame extinguishing, a ring of invisibility, a horned ring, and a brooch of shielding.\nSome time during the 14 century, Garrik was forced to flee to Undermountain after he earned the enmity of Xanathar, leader of the eponymous Xanathars Thieves Guild. While he believed his exceptional skills would keep him safe within the deeper reaches of the dungeon, he was stopped and apprehended by Muiral, one of Halasters apprentices. Seeking to punish Garrik and make him suffer, Muiral brought the thief before his master Halaster. Rather than kill the intruder, Halaster cast a number of charm spells upon the elf until his natural magical resistance was penetrated and he came under the archmages sway.\nGarrik revealed all he knew about Xanathars Thieves Guild to Halaster and quickly became his lead surface scout."
