        "mainbody": "'''Kennair Nethalin''' was a firebrand of an adventurer who lived in [[Beregost]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While he was raised to be a farmer, like his father [[Marl (person)|Marl]] before him, Kennair had a passion for helping others and making the [[Sword Coast]] a safer place to live.",
        "History": "Kennair was inspired to take up the venturing life when a group of adventurers traveled through Beregost.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Kennair cleared out some [[kobold]]s near the [[hamlet]] of [[Ulgoth's Beard]]. With the [[gold]] he earned, Kennair bought his father a new plow.\n\nSometime in the year that followed, Kennair lost his life while traveling beyond Beregost. His father deeply mourned his death and wound up spending much of his time drinking at [[Feldepost's Inn]]."
