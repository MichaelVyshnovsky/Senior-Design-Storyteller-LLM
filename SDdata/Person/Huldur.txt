'''Huldur''' was an innkeeper who ran the [[Phoenix Tail Inn]] in the [[Crossroad Keep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Huldur was a gruff-looking [[human]] man with graying hair, pale skin, a trimmed beard, and a mustache. He appeared absolutely mundane and unremarkable. By some accounts, Huldur looked like any other barkeep in the [[Realms]].

==Relationships==
Presumably, Huldur was a married man, as he had a brother-in-law who once owned land near the town of [[Port Llast]]. However, Huldur had never been to that part of the coast.

==History==
Huldur purchased the Phoenix Tail Inn from [[Sal (Neverwinter)|Sal]] of [[Neverwinter]], who ran the establishment during and shortly after the [[Shadow War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. Subsequently, Huldur's purchase began to suffer due to the crumbling post-war economy. Luckily, the Crossroad Keep became the headquarters of the trading company run by [[Sa'Sani]]. Huldur welcomed the new residents and was hopeful for his business.
