Huldur was an innkeeper who ran the Phoenix Tail Inn in the Crossroad Keep in the late 14 century DR.
Huldur was a gruff-looking human man with graying hair, pale skin, a trimmed beard, and a mustache. He appeared absolutely mundane and unremarkable. By some accounts, Huldur looked like any other barkeep in the Realms.
Presumably, Huldur was a married man, as he had a brother-in-law who once owned land near the town of Port Llast. However, Huldur had never been to that part of the coast.
Huldur purchased the Phoenix Tail Inn from Sal of Neverwinter, who ran the establishment during and shortly after the Shadow War of the . Subsequently, Huldurs purchase began to suffer due to the crumbling post-war economy. Luckily, the Crossroad Keep became the headquarters of the trading company run by SaSani. Huldur welcomed the new residents and was hopeful for his business.
