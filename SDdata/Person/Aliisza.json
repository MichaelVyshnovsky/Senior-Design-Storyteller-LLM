        "mainbody": "'''Aliisza''' was an [[alu-fiend]] (child of a [[succubus]] and [[human]]) servant and consort of the half-demon [[Kaanyr Vhok]]. She was also a friend of the fallen [[astral deva]] [[Tauran]] and mother of [[Kael]], a knight of [[Torm]].",
        "Description": "Aliisza appeared as a disarmingly beautiful adult human female with lustrous black curly hair, sea green eyes, and sharply defined eyebrows. Her true form bore her heritage by the pair of black demon wings mounted on her upper back. She often carried means to take different shapes to hide her wings and thus not reveal her true self unless necessary.\n\nAliisza's natural form had sharp fangs, which she usually disguised to as to appear more humanlike.\n\nShe often wore a tight black leather [[corset]]. She also owned a red dress, which she wore with a tight corselet with black lace.",
        "Personality": "Alliisza was calculating and cold, always planning her moves ahead of time. She was also alluring and voluptuous. She was not averse to seducing anyone, for either business or pleasure.",
        "History": {
            "Background": "Aliisza was the consort of [[Kaanyr Vhok]], the leader of the [[Scoured Legion]]. She spent decades with him trapped beneath [[Hellgate Keep]].",
            "The War of the Spider Queen": "In [[1372 DR]], Aliisza resided in [[Ammarindar]] with Vhok, who sent her to spy on the [[Menzoberranzan|Menzoberranyr]] [[drow]] who were working to uncover the mystery of the [[Silence of Lolth]]. It was during this time that she met the wizard [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], whose child she later bore. She served as Vhok's liaison to [[Gracklstugh]], as well as to [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]].\n\nVhok sent her to spy on the journeys of Pharaun Mizzrym and [[Quenthel Baenre]]. She secretly aided Pharaun in steering a [[ship of chaos]] from the [[Lake of Shadows]] to the [[Abyss]]. She bid him farewell there and after his death retrieved the only remaining part of his body: a single finger.",
            "The Spellplague": "In [[1373 DR]], not long after the Scoured Legion left Menzoberranzan, Aliisza disguised herself as a serving girl named Ansa and infiltrated the household of [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]] in order to discredit him on behalf of Vhok, who wished to conquer [[Sundabar]]. Unbeknownst to her, Vhok and the priest [[Zasian Menz]] discovered she was pregnant and concocted a plan to use that to their advantage. They explained the plan to her but put her under a ''[[geas]]'' and made her forget until the time was right. Aliiza was captured by the [[astral deva]] [[Tauran]], a servant of [[Tyr]], and sent to the [[House of the Triad]] in order to give her child a chance to live a life of good, and to give Aliisza a chance at redeeming herself for her evil deeds.\n\nWhile standing trial before the Guardian, the knowledge that she was with child was revealed to her for the first time. After hearing her child must remain in that heavenly realm, Aliisza felt a very uncharacteristic moment of sadness and fear of losing her child, and she agreed to remain in the House of the Triad in order to hopefully be one day reunited with her child. Her mind was imprisoned in a lonely duplicate of the House, where she roamed at will, experienced her vile deeds from an outside perspective, and was occasionally visited by Tauran, who tried to show her the error of her ways and to persuade her to the side of good. While her spirit was undergoing those personality-changing trials, Aliisza's body gave birth to her son, [[Kael]], who was sired by the drow Pharaun Mizzrym (although Aliisza had expected it to be Vhok's child).\n\nUpon seeing her son for the first time (many years after his birth, although the time passed much more quickly for her), Aliisza's magically removed memories came flooding back and her body was switched with that of her son. In that form, she traveled to the lair of the [[storm dragon]] [[Tekthyrios]] and shoved mushrooms down his throat, allowing a portal from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] to open in his belly and allow Vhok and Zasian to pass through. In that moment, twelve years passed in the outside world, Kael and Tauran appeared, Aliisza was returned to her own body, and it was revealed that Zasian was a priest of [[Cyric]] intending to wreak havoc on the heavens.\n\nAliisza aided Vhok (''geased'' into helping), Tauran, and Kael in hunting down Zasian. She later allied with [[Micus]], who was hunting them, in an attempt to prevent Zasian and [[Kashada]] from stealing [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]], but failed and her friends felt she had betrayed them, although she redeemed herself by helping them later.\n\nAfter Cyric used Azuth's staff to slay [[Mystra]], magic went awry and Aliisza suffered from the effects of the [[Spellplague]], gaining incredible magic power fueled by consuming her own life force. She and her companions ended up in the company of [[demon]]s fighting [[devil]]s in a remnant of the [[Blood Rift]]. Vhok betrayed them there, joining up with the [[marilith]] [[Vhissilka]], and so Aliisza was forced to come up with a plan to reach freedom. She took Pharaun's desiccated finger from inside her sword and used it to summon his soul to enter the soulless body of Zasian, who had become a [[Living Vessel]]. Pharaun used his magic to effect their escape, but they were promptly captured and imprisoned by agents of the House of the Triad. However, when the demon lord [[Axithar]]'s legions began invading the plane, they were released and headed to the [[Lifespring]] to prevent Vhok from reaching it. Vhok plunged his sword into Aliisza's stomach, and as she told him that she had once loved him she used the last of her life force to cast a spell to stop his heart. She died in the arms of her son, and even the healing powers of the [[Lifespring]] could not heal her. As she was dying she gave Kael his father's ring."
        },
        "Abilities": "Aliisza was naturally able to disguise herself with magic. She could innately summon [[Dimension Door|interdimensional portals]].",
        "Possessions": "Aliisza carried daggers in her belt and boots. She also had a magical [[Spellblade]] long sword and a [[ring of protection]], which protected her from physical blows, on the third finger of her left hand.\n\nShe carried a whistle that commanded the [[Scoured Legion]].\n\nAfter retrieving Pharaun's finger, she kept it inside a compartment in her sword.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Kaanyr Vhok": "Aliisza was [[Kaanyr Vhok]]'s consort. Feeling that Vhok was soon to be a major power in the [[North]], she was as loyal to him as a chaotic evil being could be. However, he felt betrayed by her loyalty to angels and betrayed her first, although he did admit to missing her afterwards, as he had always had a soft spot for her. She used the last energy of her life to slay him to protect the [[Lifespring]] and her son.",
            "Pharaun Mizzrym": "Aliisza was fascinated with Pharaun's wit after first meeting him in the tunnels of Ammarindar. She allowed him and his band to escape Vhok's army of [[tanarukk]]s. During the course of events, she had several intimate encounters with the drow [[mage]] [[Pharaun Mizzrym]]. (It was during one of these trysts that she unknowingly became pregnant with [[Kael]].) When she saw him in peril in [[Ched Nasad]], she saved his life. She also felt possessive of him; seeing the beautiful [[Danifae Yauntyrr]] with him, she claimed Pharaun as her own.",
            "Kael": "[[Kael]] was Aliisza's son, fathered by Pharaun Mizzrym. Upon learning she was pregnant, Aliisza instantly felt protective of her baby; she claimed that was from her human side. Upon first meeting him, she hated his goodness and wanted to undo the fact that he had been raised as a champion of Torm. However, as she came to know him, she began to truly care for him, even protecting him against her lover. She died in Kael's arms."
