'''Danzo Arkwright''' was the [[dwarf]] in charge of the [[Sword Coast Couriers]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood of the Outer City of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Danzo was a tan-skinned [[gold dwarf]] with blue eyes and chestnut hair. He kept his face clean-shaven.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Danzo Arkwright worked as the postmaster of the Sword Coast Couriers. However, his work was stressful as the region was affected by a looming threat of a war with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], which led to some of the carriers being killed, letters being undelivered, and the loss of courier [[dog]]s. Trying to deliver letters in a timely manner, Danzo employed a small flock of carrier pigeons; however, that also proved to be a challenge when something started killing the birds off, and more letters were undelivered, including Danzo's personal correspondence. The said correspondence was Danzo's communications with [[Roah Moonglow]], a [[Zhentarim]] cell's leader in Baldur's Gate. Danzo was to deliver an ''[[iron flask]]'' that was supposed to be smuggled into the city from the [[Waukeen's Rest]] Zhent cell for the [[Vanthampur]]s, and as that shipment was lost, the noble family was lost as a customer. Another letter was sent out to [[Gomwick]], one of Danzo's couriers, but the warning message never reached the man. The reason for the pigeon mail disappearances was [[Tara]], a [[Waterdhavian]] [[tressym]], and a long-time companion of [[Gale Dekarios]]. The winged cat preyed on delicious pigeons and cared naught for the missing letters.
