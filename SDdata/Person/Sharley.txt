==Description==
Sharley was a [[human]] woman with light skin and [[Kara-Tur]]an features â€“ black hair, cut short, and black eyes. She wore simple laborer's [[tunic]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Sharley was a bosun who ran a small boat from the harbors of Baldur's Gate. After her last competent shipmate left the employ and joined the [[Flaming Fist]], leaving only [[Listless]] and [[Kadugan]] to work with, two men who complained more than they loaded the cargo.
