'''Muthtur''' was a [[half-orc]] outcast and gladiator at the [[Arena beneath Llorkh]].
{{quote
|I'm no novelty, I'm a person. And I killed the man who said it.
}}
==Description==
The half-orc wore brown [[chain mail]], as well as scum-green clothing. He fought with a [[longsword]] that had a purple guard and pommel, as well as a [[shield]]. Muthtur's looks certainly favored his [[orc]] heritage, having a snout and two large tusks.

==Personality==
He believed most people scorned his appearance, and did not hesitate from saying it. Despite this demeanor, all he really wanted was to be at peace in his home.

==History==
Muthtur lived with a group of other outcasts in the [[High Forest]]. One day, he was seized from the forest he called home, and taken to the Arena beneath Llorkh. On his way in, the half-orc spotted a secret door to the northern alcove of the arena. He was to entertain the crowd at the arena as a "novelty fighter", as there were mostly only [[human]]s or monsters fighting.

|text=Yes, I'm a half-orc, and to you I'm ugly as an [[otyugh]]. I'm also the hideous, inhuman thing that saved your lives.
|source=Muthtur, to the future Heroes of Ascore.
}}
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the half-orc hatched a plan to escape the arena. When a new party, who would become the [[Heroes of Ascore]], had finished their first fight in the arena, he distracted the guards, and the adventurers grabbed the keys. He told his story, and also the whereabouts of the secret exit.
