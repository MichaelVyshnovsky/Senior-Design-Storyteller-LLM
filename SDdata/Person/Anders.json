        "mainbody": "'''Anders''' was a [[human]] agent of the [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]] who posed as a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]], God of Justice.\n\n{{Quote|Enough - enough! I'll not play pretend anymore. [[Karlach]], you're going home in pieces if you must. And you - you'll soon learn what it means to ally with this garbadge.|Anders}}",
        "Personality": "After surviving the clash with the [[tiefling]] [[Karlach Cliffgate]] and cornering her, Anders took on the personality of an exhausted [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] in the hopes of gaining the sympathy of passing adventurers who could aid him in slaying or capturing his mark. In truth, he is a cruel, impatient, and eager servant of [[Zariel]].",
        "Abilities": "Anders possess strength beyond the capabilities of other men thanks to his deal with [[Zariel]].",
        "Possessions": "Anders wields the [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] ''[[sword of justice]]'', which he claims was blessed by [[Tyr]]. Though considering Ander's true allegiance, the validity of this claim is questionable.",
        "Relationships": "Anders carried out his service alongside the [[halfling]] [[ranger]] [[Trynn]], the [[dwarf]] [[Rurik]], and a [[spellcaster|spellcasting]] trader named [[Cyrel]].",
        "History": "Sometime in the year {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Anders was tasked by [[Zariel]] to bring the [[tiefling]] [[Karlach Cliffgate]] back to the [[Nine Hells]] after she escaped the archdevil's service by boarding a [[Nautiloid]].\n\nAnders and his companions caught up with the tiefling somewhere along the [[Risen Road]] and managed to injure her, but could not kill her. Sometime around [[Uktar 16]], the group stopped by a nearby tollhouse along the [[River Chionthar]] to corner their mark and were subsequently attacked by [[gnoll]] [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]] loyal to [[the Absolute]], though Anders and his companions managed to slay them."
