He wore purple mages robes, trimmed in blue and armed himself with an emerald-tipped staff.\nBeing a proficient spellcaster, Desram often used such offensive spells as Melfs acid arrow, ice storm, arc lightning, fiery blast, magic missiles, and could enter a state of spell flurry when threatened or hurt. He possessed resistance to fire, force, lightning, and cold magic and could cast the cure serious wounds spell.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Desram organized a band of bandits who forged an alliance with orcish and goblin raiders who attacked travelers and merchants on the road from Neverwinter to Waterdeep. First Lieutenant Gadain of Neverwinter sent a band of heroes to stop the raids and the group returned with a worrying eyewitness accounts â€“ orcish raiders were aided by humans.
