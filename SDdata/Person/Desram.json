        "mainbody": "'''Desram''' was a bandit leader from the [[Sword Coast North]], active in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Desram was an older [[human]] male with graying hair and beard. He wore purple mage's [[robe]]s, trimmed in blue and armed himself with an [[emerald]]-tipped [[staff]].",
        "Abilities": "Being a proficient [[spell]]caster, Desram often used such offensive spells as ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[arc lightning]]'', ''[[fiery blast]]'', ''[[magic missile]]s'', and could enter a state of ''spell flurry'' when threatened or hurt. He possessed resistance to fire, force, lightning, and cold magic and could cast the ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Desram organized a band of bandits who forged an alliance with [[orc]]ish and [[goblin]] raiders who attacked travelers and merchants on the road from [[Neverwinter]] to [[Waterdeep]]. First Lieutenant [[Gadain]] of Neverwinter sent a band of heroes to stop the raids and the group returned with a worrying eyewitness accounts â€“ orcish raiders were aided by humans. They also retrieved a map that indicated that the human bandit camp was located just off the [[High Road]], in the westernmost foothills of the [[Sword Mountains]]. The First Lieutenant dispatched the heroes to the bandit encampment to stop Desram's raiders once and for all."
