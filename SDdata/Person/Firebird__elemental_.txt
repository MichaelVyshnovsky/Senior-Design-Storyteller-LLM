The '''Firebird''' was an [[elemental]] of [[air]] and [[fire]] that was part of a cell of the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]] that operated out of [[Sambral]], one of the [[Windrise Ports]] of [[Laerakond]], in [[1479 DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|35}}

==Description==
The Firebird was completely made out of fire.

==History==
In 1479 DR, the Firebird was kept as [[Inar Venenellin|Pyrultimus]]' pet in a house of the cell of the cult in Sambral, under the care of a cultist named [[Bazamarl]]. To feed it, Bazamarl kidnapped citizens from Sambral on a regular basis.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|40}}

The Firebird was killed by a band of [[adventurer]]s that were sent by [[Halagothra|Halagothra the Healer]] to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, while trying to rescue the [[doppleganger]] [[Iphimedra]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|36}}
