The Firebird was an elemental of air and fire that was part of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame that operated out of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond, in 1479 DR.
The Firebird was completely made out of fire.
In 1479 DR, the Firebird was kept as Pyrultimus pet in a house of the cell of the cult in Sambral, under the care of a cultist named Bazamarl. To feed it, Bazamarl kidnapped citizens from Sambral on a regular basis.
The Firebird was killed by a band of adventurers that were sent by Halagothra the Healer to Sambral to destroy the cell of the cult operating there, while trying to rescue the doppleganger Iphimedra.
