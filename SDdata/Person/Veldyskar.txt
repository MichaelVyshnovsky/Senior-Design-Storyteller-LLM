'''Veldyskar''' was an intelligent [[basilisk]] living in [[Gravenhollow]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
A [[stone giant]] visitor to Gravenhollow donated Veldyskar to the keepers of the library to act as a guardian and general-purpose helper countless years before the 1480s DR.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the basilisk met an expedition led by some [[adventurer]]s, who'd been hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to investigate the threat of a [[demon lord]], at the gate of Gravenhollow.

==Personality==
Veldyskar's philosophy during fights was to petrify first and ask questions later. To avoid problems, the keepers taught him how to cast a ''[[greater restoration]]'' spell.
