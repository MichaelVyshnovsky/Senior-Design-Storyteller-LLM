Shinzi was a half-drow in Menzoberranzan during the late 1480s.
Shinzi was the daughter of a human slave and a drow merchant. Orphaned, she was adopted by Dalfred Noakes as a step-daughter and was more important as a spy.
Outwardly, Shinzi acted as a promoter for her step-fathers inn, the Narbondels Shadow in the Eastmyr district. In truth, she spied on the drow, searching for a sign of weakness to use against them.
Shinzi was adopted by Dalfred, who used her as one of his spies.
