}}'''Shinzi''' was a [[half-drow]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] during the late 1480s.

==History==
Shinzi was the daughter of a [[human]] slave and a [[drow]] merchant. Orphaned, she was adopted by [[Dalfred Noakes]] as a step-daughter and was more important as a spy.

==Activities==
Outwardly, Shinzi acted as a promoter for her step-father's inn, the [[Narbondel's Shadow]] in the [[Eastmyr]] district. In truth, she spied on the drow, searching for a sign of weakness to use against them.

==Relationships==
Shinzi was adopted by Dalfred, who used her as one of his spies.
