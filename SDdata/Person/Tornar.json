        "Personality": "He was always on edge, instinctively reaching for his weapons even while speaking to his master.",
        "Description": "He trod very quietly.",
        "Possessions": "Tornar carried a crossbow, at least, and poison, almost certainly [[bloodbite]] by [[Sharantyr]]'s appreciation.",
        "Activities": "He was a spy for Belgon Bradaskor, the Master of Shadows of Scornubel; in fact he was many of the man's \"eyes\". He also served as an assassin to boot.",
        "Relationships": "According to the Zhentarim, he was [[Belgon Bradaskor]]'s most trusted spy.",
        "History": "On late {{yearlink|1357}}, Tornar reported to [[Belgon Bradaskor]] that he'd been a witness to [[Marlel]] leading [[Shandril Shessair]] and her husband into an ambush at [[the Stormy Tankard]], and was told to inform [[Rendilar Bluthlock]] he was free to spend with Belgon's backing to send people after Shandril, so they'd be on the line of fire of all the factions hunting after her [[spellfire]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|130-133|8}} Unknown to him, he was scried on by the [[Zhentarim]] [[Korthauvar Hammantle]] and [[Hlael Toraunt]], who already knew of him.\n\nTornar eventually caught up to Sharantyr, and struck at her with a poisoned [[crossbow]] quarrel. He accepted a token from her: a lock of hair, instead of finishing the job, confident the poison would finish her off, though Sharantyr claimed she knew the poison to be [[bloodbite]], which did not affect her. She enspelled him with some powdered gemstone, which compelled him to go as far from her as possible.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|303-305|17}}\n\nImmediately after Shandril Shessair's immolation, Sharantyr was teleported all the way back to the [[Blackrocks]], where Tornar found her again, badly injured. Rather than kill her, he said he wanted to part with her as a friend, and helped her rest safely.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|343-345|20}}"
