Brysis of Khaem was a wraith sorcerer in the Lost Tomb of Khaem in the late 15 century DR.
In life, Brysis was a great sorcerer in Netheril. On the day of her death, she was interred in a floating tomb.
After the fall of Netheril, Brysiss tomb plummeted into a crevasse and wound up in the Underdark region of the Silken Paths, where it remained for centuries.
Magical energies awoke Brysis from the eternal sleep of death as a wraith, served by specters who were once her loyal retainers. 
A party of adventurers escaping drow slavers of Velkynvelve with help of Fargas Rumblefoot may have defeated her.
