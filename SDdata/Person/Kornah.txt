Kornah "The Crazy" was a member of the Harpers who posed as a crazed guide of Zhentil Keep. She had a pet crow named Shalla with whom Kornah shared a weak mental-link.
Kornahs house, in keeping with her disguise, is a disheveled mess. This is all for appearances, though, as it in actuality serves as a safehouse for any Harpers in the region.
