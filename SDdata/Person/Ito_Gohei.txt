'''Ito Gohei''' was a cursed [[wu jen]] in [[Ito-jo]] in [[1360 DR]].

==History==
Ito Gohei was a [[dwarf]] retainer of the [[Ito family]] who died in the castle's burning in [[647 DR]]. Thanks to an ''[[ancient curse]]'' and a [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]]'s influence, he did not truly die and instead continued to haunt the castle as the sixth of the seven weapon masters. Finally, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] fought and destroyed him.
