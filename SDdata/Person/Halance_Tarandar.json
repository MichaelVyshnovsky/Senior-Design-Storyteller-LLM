        "mainbody": "alance Dustrin Tarandar was a senior chamberjack in Castle Obarskyr of Suzail in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was large, but agile, and darkly handsome, often dressing in the livery of a chamberjack.\nAs a senior chamberjack, he was the head of a duty of eight other chamberjacks.\nHe was a friend of Lord Arclath Delcastle and the War Wizard Belnar Buckmantle.\nAfter the Open Feast held at Castle Obarskyr on Mirtul 26 of the , Arclath Delcastle brought his friends Belnar and Halance to the Dragonriders Club of Suzail to help them relax a bit from the work needed for the upcoming Council of the Dragon.\nAt a later date, an exhausted Halance was sent to Zorsins Dock by Khaladan Mallowfaer. Before going, he learned that Belnar Buckmantle had been murdered. The mental influence of the evil, scheming archmage Manshoon made him suddenly suspect the stare of the masked dancer Amarune Whitewave from the club, and write a note to himself to warn Arclath of the murder and his suspicions about the dancer, which he placed in his pocket. He was murdered shortly afterwards.\nThe note in Halances pocket immediately made Arclath a suspect for the War Wizards he received a visit from Glathra Barcantle questioning him about their conversation, which set Arclath on a path where he met with Amarune and became close with her. He eventually accepted that it was probably a coincidence."
