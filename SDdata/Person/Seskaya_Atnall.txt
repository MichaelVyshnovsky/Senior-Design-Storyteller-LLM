Seskaya Atnall was an innkeeper in Mulmaster in 1373 DR.
Seskaya was born in Zhentil Keep where her parents were Zhentarim spies. When she was a teenager, all the family was relocated to Mulmaster under the orders of their Zhent masters. When her parents went on a mission out of Mulmaster and never returned, Seskaya continued to work for the Zhentarim.
Seskaya managed the Sleeping Serpent inn, a Zhent safe house in Mulmaster. She was always surrounded by suitors, whom Seskaya used only as a source of information to give to the Zhents.
