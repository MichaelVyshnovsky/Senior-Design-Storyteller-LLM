        "mainbody": "'''Harbesh Carver''' was an adventuring thug and thief, member of the [[Hands of Fury]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Harbesh was an unpleasant individual. A [[shield dwarf]] outcast and a thug liked to stay out of any discussions or arguments that sparked between his teammates. He was a grumpy, capable, smart, and very strong individual who showed more interest and affection to a difficult lock than even the friendliest man or woman.",
        "Possessions": "Harbesh wore a set of [[leather armor]] and was armed with a [[short sword]] as well as a small [[crossbow]].",
        "History": "Harbesh joined his adventuring group sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, when he, along with the Hands of Fury, traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of [[Luskan]], ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of [[Targos]], besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]."
