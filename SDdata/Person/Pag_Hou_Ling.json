        "mainbody": "'''Pag Hou Ling''' was dzong-pon (sheriff or district officer) of the town of [[Chophon]] in [[Tabot]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.",
        "History": "Pag's mother came from [[T'u Lung]] as a refugee. At the age of 15, he started working for the Council Kashag of Tabot, serving as assistant deputy to the dzong-pon of [[Tsetu]] for ten years. Next, for six years, Pag worked as an itinerant secretary in Tabot's southern districts.\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2605|SY}}, Pag fought a group of bandits from [[Shou Lung]] and was rewarded for his courage. Pag was appointed as dzong-pon of Chophon.",
        "Activities": "He demonstrated himself very capable as dzong-pon, displaying a good knowledge of his district, having no tolerance of crime, and keeping his forces disciplined and alert for troubles both domestic and foreign. Thus, Pag was highly respected for his shrewd leadership and his skills as a sheriff while Chophon was known as a safe and well-patrolled place.\n\nHe made many visits to the [[Do'dzin Gompa]], of which he was a regular benefactor.",
        "Personality": "Pag was considered the epitome of a Tabotan: zealously devoted the High Lama and his dogma. A rigid adherent of the rules of the lamas, Pag never touched alcoholic drinks or even permitted women to be in the same room as him. He believed all the stories about the first High Lord of Oceans, [[H'Dang Li]], no matter how fantastic.",
        "Description": "Being half-[[Shou]] and taking after his mother's side, Pag was slightly taller and had slighter cheekbones than the typical [[Tabotan]]. His hair was long but kept tied in a knot at the nape for luck when in battle. A magical [[spell]] left him [[deaf]] in the right ear.",
        "Possessions": "In combat, he donned [[copper]] [[do-maru]] armor and a copper mask."
