Pag was appointed as dzong-pon of Chophon.\nHe demonstrated himself very capable as dzong-pon, displaying a good knowledge of his district, having no tolerance of crime, and keeping his forces disciplined and alert for troubles both domestic and foreign. Thus, Pag was highly respected for his shrewd leadership and his skills as a sheriff while Chophon was known as a safe and well-patrolled place.\nHe made many visits to the Dodzin Gompa, of which he was a regular benefactor.\nPag was considered the epitome of a Tabotan zealously devoted the High Lama and his dogma. A rigid adherent of the rules of the lamas, Pag never touched alcoholic drinks or even permitted women to be in the same room as him. He believed all the stories about the first High Lord of Oceans, HDang Li, no matter how fantastic.\nBeing half-Shou and taking after his mothers side, Pag was slightly taller and had slighter cheekbones than the typical Tabotan. His hair was long but kept tied in a knot at the nape for luck when in battle. A magical spell left him deaf in the right ear.\nIn combat, he donned copper do-maru armor and a copper mask."
