        "History": "[[File:Lewy and pig.jpg|left|thumb|Lewy's and his pig's fate]]\nLewy was a farmer of the West Harbor. Once, he took a bard into the [[Mere of Dead Men|swamp]], who did not return.\n\nIn the [[Harvest Fair]], Lewy attempted to win at the hog contest, cheating by using magic to enlarge his pig. [[Orlen]] had doubts and tasked the [[Kalach-Cha]] to investigate; Lewy was prepared to bribe the Kalach-Cha to avoid being exposed. After the Harvest Fair, however, Lewy and his hog were killed by the [[duergar]] and [[bladeling]]s."
