Vrag was a cornugon lieutenant in Dragonspear Castle circa 1363 DR.
Vrag led one of the Hordes of Dragonspear, specifically the Marauders, a group composed of one unit of 500 kobolds and one unit of 500 goblins led by the able chieftain Pruj.
Vrag disliked his current position, believing he led the weakest army. In order to impress Baazka, he ordered his warriors to make very dangerous assaults.
