'''Hua Li Te''' was a powerful abbot in [[Shou Lung]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Hua Li managed the [[Pure Thought Monastery]], the largest monastery in [[Arakin]].

==Personality==
Thanks to his age, Hua Li remembered well the time of the great religious wars and was determined to never live through a similar time again. For this, he was very severe with monks or [[sohei]] of his monastery that fought with other sects. Thank to his cunning and skill, Hua Li was still the most powerful of his monastery.
