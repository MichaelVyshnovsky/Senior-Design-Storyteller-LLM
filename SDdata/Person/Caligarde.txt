'''Caligarde''' was a [[mage]] who studied the [[arcane]] arts under the [[Seven Wizards]] of [[Myth Drannor]], survived the fall of the city and went on to become a spell inventor of note.

==Description== 
Known for his arrogance, sarcastic wit and impatience, Caligarde was mischievous in his search for magical knowledge.

==History==
After the destruction of Myth Drannor, Caligarde developed a hatred for [[elves]], to the point where he hunted down every elven [[mage]] he caught off-guard. During this time, he took on many [[human]] apprentices who shared his ruthlessness.

==Invented spells==
