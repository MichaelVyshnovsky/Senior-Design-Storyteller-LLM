'''Malvred Silverguild''' was a wildly successful merchant inhabiting the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was a shrewd negotiator and was rarely outfoxed when making deals.

==Activities==
Malvred lived within southern Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] in [[Silverguild Manor]]. He owned the vast complex of buildings known as [[Prosperity House]] which, in addition to the main manor, included [[Prosperity Emporium]] and the [[Prosperity Caravan Company]].

He was, by far, the wealthiest merchant within Zhentil Keep following the city's destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. Though he did not care much for politics, Malvred was considered by the city's rulers to fill a seat on the new [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]].

==Relationships==
He had two children from his wife [[Eunice Silverguild|Eunice]]–a son named [[Meryn Silverguild|Meryn]] and daughter named [[Emelia Silverguild|Emelia]].
