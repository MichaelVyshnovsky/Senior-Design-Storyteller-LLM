Tomar ran a small school where he educated priests represented by every [[Zakharan pantheon|Zakharan god]], though Tomar worshiped [[Haku]].

A small tent was used for his classroom. He taught anywhere between 3â€”15 students at a time over the course of 3-week periods. The cost of tuition was 1,000 [[dinar]]s.
