Tomar, or Tomar of the Winds, was an elven inhabitant of the Pilgrims District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Tomar ran a small school where he educated priests represented by every Zakharan god, though Tomar worshiped Haku.
A small tent was used for his classroom. He taught anywhere between 3â€”15 students at a time over the course of 3-week periods. The cost of tuition was 1,000 dinars.
