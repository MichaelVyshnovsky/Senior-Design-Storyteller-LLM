        "mainbody": "Dorina Tsarran was a drow vampire and a priestess of Kiaransalee in the late 14 century DR.\nShe was was the daughter of Irae Tsarran.\nDorina was gaunt with deep black skin and yellowish-white hair. Her face was beautiful and angular, with something of a feral look about it. She snarled like a wild animal while fighting, revealing her sharp fangs and conveying an expression of being less coldly calculating and strategic than she actually was.\nDorina typically wore a set of black elven chainmail and carried a heavy mace, which left her off-hand free to make life-draining attacks.\nShe was sent to Szith Morcane to hunt down the refugees from fallen Maerimydra after the Silence of Lolth in the . After taking control of the outpost, Dorina set about organizing raids on the surface lands of Daggerdale.\nCirca 1486 DR, she and some of her drider minions captured and tried to kill the archmage of Szith Morcane, Solom Nedrazak, during the allied assault on Maerimydra."
