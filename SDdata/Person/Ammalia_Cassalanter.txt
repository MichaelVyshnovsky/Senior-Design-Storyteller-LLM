'''Ammalia Cassalanter''' ({{Pronounce|ah|MAW|lee|ah|_|KAS|ah|lan|ter|refs=}}) was a [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the wife of [[Victoro Cassalanter]].

==Activities==
Ammalia was schooled in the [[arcane]] arts. Like her husband, she was the leader of a Cult of [[Asmodeus]] that involved certain nobles in [[Waterdeep]].

During an average day, she normally tended to her garden, smoked on the balcony, dismally watching the ocean, or wept at a transformed [[Osvaldo Cassalanter|Osvaldo]]'s feet in her [[House Cassalanter|mansion]]'s attic.

==History==
In [[1489 DR]],

In 1492 Ammalia and her husband planned to recover the lost gold of [[Dagult Neverember]] and use it to buy back the souls of their children Meantime Ammalia planned to serve poison food during a party ousted during the [[Founders' Day]] celebration in order to gain the ninety-nine souls they need.

If Ammalia and Victoro presented in time the gold and the ninety-nine souls to a [[devil]] servant of Asmodeus the souls of Terenzio and Elzerina would be safe.
