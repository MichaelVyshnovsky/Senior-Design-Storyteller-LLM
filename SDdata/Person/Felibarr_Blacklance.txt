'''Felibarr Blacklance''' was a bounty hunter and [[assassin]] who inhabited the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the 1350's [[DR]].

==History==
Felibarr followed a particularly wicked [[mage]] named [[Melinter]]. He would meet his master, along with other apprentices and members of their gang, in a small courtyard in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. The courtyard would later become known as [[Melinter's Court]] because of these meetings.

Felibarr was a skilled [[wizard]] who developed the ''[[blacklance]]'' [[spell]].

He also spent alot of time at the [[Blushing Mermaid (Waterdeep)|Blushing Mermaid]] tavern in Waterdeep.
