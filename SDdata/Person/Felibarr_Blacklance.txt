Felibarr Blacklance was a bounty hunter and assassin who inhabited the city of Waterdeep during the 1350s DR.
Felibarr followed a particularly wicked mage named Melinter. He would meet his master, along with other apprentices and members of their gang, in a small courtyard in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The courtyard would later become known as Melinters Court because of these meetings.
Felibarr was a skilled wizard who developed the blacklance spell.
He also spent alot of time at the Blushing Mermaid tavern in Waterdeep.
