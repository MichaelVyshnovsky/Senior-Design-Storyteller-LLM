        "mainbody": "'''Artimezt''' was a [[drow]] mercenary who accompanied [[Dhourn Ba'Tol]] during his search for the legendary [[Adamantine Forge]].",
        "History": "The drow [[wizard]] Dhourn Ba'Tol vowed to share his fortune with a group of drow mercenaries in exchange for protection if they found the Adamantine Forge. The group consisted of [[Arcagh]], Artimezt, [[Izwae]], [[Moy]] and [[Tecothy]].\n\nHowever, Dhourn's rival [[Xargrim]] sought to find the Forge first and once met Dhourn. The rivals were both planning an ambush against each other, but began to talk of a pact, ultimately arguing until their words turned to screams. Xargrim summoned an unusual [[spectator]] adept at [[petrification]] and fled. Dhourn and his companions were all petrified for so long that Dhourn's memory shard faded."
