The group consisted of Arcagh, Artimezt, Izwae, Moy and Tecothy.\nHowever, Dhourns rival Xargrim sought to find the Forge first and once met Dhourn. The rivals were both planning an ambush against each other, but began to talk of a pact, ultimately arguing until their words turned to screams. Xargrim summoned an unusual spectator adept at petrification and fled. Dhourn and his companions were all petrified for so long that Dhourns memory shard faded."
