A scholarly [[weretiger]], referred to as a '''librarian''', that was active in the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I have the superior intellect! I am the god of knowledge! Bow down before me!|The battlecry of the weretiger, overtaken by the madness of [[Undermountain]].}}

==Description==
In his weretiger form the librarian wore a red [[tunic]], a pair of [[spectacles]], a [[belt]] around the waist that had [[book]]s latched to it, footwraps, and a single leather [[bracer]] that had compartments for carrying three [[scroll]]s.

==Personality==
He considered his [[lycanthropy]] to be a blessing, rather than a [[curse]], and would interject with this belief whenever anyone referred to it as being a curse.

==History==
Sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1493}},The character profile of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] states his age to be 196 years old. Seeing as how he was born in [[1297 DR]] (''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', p. 132), ''Idle Champions'' must be set in 1493 DR. That being said, the developers have stated they intentionally keep the game's timeline vague, to allow them to pick and choose the characters (or character ''versions'') they want. this weretiger was living among a group of [[Beshaba]] worshiping [[lycanthrope]]s that had taken over a ruined temple deep in the darkest reaches of the [[Neverwinter Woods]], acting as the steward of the temple's library. The group went about afflicting the condition upon the locals, including [[Pavel Nonov]].

One day a group of [[adventurer]]s entered the Neverwinter Woods in search of a missing woman by the name [[Kara Bakovski]]. They encountered the hunter [[Randal Amberwood]], who informed them that he had tracked beasts down to the abandoned temple. Once they made it to the temple the adventurers found Kara in the company of a [[werewolf]] and moved to attack it, but she yelled at them to stop and explained that the beast was her fiance. Introducing himself as Pavel Nonov, the werewolf expressed a desire to be cured of his lycanthropy. After expressing that they would need a scroll of ''[[remove curse]]'', Pavel suggested the group might be able to find something in the temple's disorganized library. They rummaged through its shelves a bit, finding a copy of ''[[Volo's Guide to Lycanthropy]]'', but once realizing that they weren't fellow lycanthropes the weretiger attacked them.

Having survived his encounter with the adventurers and with his group dismantled, the weretiger fled the Neverwinter Woods. He eventually made his way into the [[Arcane Chambers]] of [[Undermountain]], seeking to research the lost lore held within books on that level. Unperturbed by the [[gibbering mouther]]s and [[nothic]]s that inhabited the level, the weretiger continued his studies for well over a year.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, a group of adventurers were traveling through the Arcane Chambers in search of [[Nihiloor]] and encountered several gibbering mouthers gathered around a bin of books. Their fighting garnered the attention of the weretiger librarian, irritated at the disturbance, and the two groups recognized each other from the temple back in Neverwinter Woods. The group pleaded that they had no quarrel but him, but having fallen under the sway of Undermountain's madness the weretiger lept into combat against the adventurers.
