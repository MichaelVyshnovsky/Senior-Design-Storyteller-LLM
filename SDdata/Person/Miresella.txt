'''Miresella''' was a scout from [[Baldur's Gate]].

==History==
Miresella was following a caravan when she happened to discover the secret [[Cult of the Dragon]] village of [[Parnast]]. She was captured and transported to the Cult's hunting lodge in the [[Greypeak Mountains]], under the care of [[Talis Kasterel]], who deeply scared her.
