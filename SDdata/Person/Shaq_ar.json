        "mainbody": "Shaqar was the leader of the Golden Mane wemic pride, which migrated across the plains of the Shaar during the 14 century DR.\nThe alpha wemic Shaqar had golden fur, which was regularly interrupted by noticeable battle scars, and a glorious, dark red mane streaked with gold.\nHe was smarter than most of his kind and strove to be a fair and authoritative leader of his kin.\nShaqar was entirely in love with his favored mate Wrokeen, the prides head scout and hunter.\nAmong Shaqars possessions was a covering of a +2 hide armor, above which he wore an elaborate decorative pectoral made of gold and blue dragon teeth, taken from a wyrm that he slayed during his adventuring days. In battle, he had a pair of gloves of dexterity and wielded an enchanted greatclub. Although his strength and skill had long since surpassed its justifiable use, Shaqar kept the composite bow he used to hunt in his youth.\nIn his youth, Shaqar traveled with a band of adventurers. During one of their journeys, they encountered and managed to slay a blue dragon, from which Shaqar took its teeth as a trophy.\nPrior to Shaqar, the leadership of the Golden Mane was under the lead of his uncle. When the elder wemic became too aged to lead, Shaqar challenged him to single combat and justly won leadership of the pride.\nWhen the dark and sullen wemic Beren was younger, Shaqar was insightful enough to see that he posed a threat to the pride as a whole. He encouraged the scrawny and misguided youth to seek out the adventuring life away from the pride. Upon Berens return, Sharar watched him quite fiercely, having concern about his suspicious activities."
