Noro Amoto was a samurai mercenary from Kozakura in the mid–14 century DR. He was commander of the Bushido mercenary army.
Noro Amoto founded the Bushido army to defend the lands of Kara-Tur against the Tuigan Horde during the Horde Wars of the late 1350s DR. They fought capably, and continued marching westward.
After the Tuigans defeat, Noro was inspired by contact with the west to go on to Faerûn on a fact-finding mission, hoping to learn more about Faerûnian culture and military techniques. He planned to return to Kara-Tur and report back to Amotos master in Kozakura.
By the early 1360s DR, they were operating in Chessenta. The Bushido had fought two inconclusive battles against the Renegades.
Noro accepted only honorable work and was picky over what contracts he took. His soldiers followed the code of bushido at all times and never looted the dead.
Noro commanded with a firm hand and total authority tempered by wisdom and skill.
He wielded a +2 katana, wore o-yoroi armor, and had a daikyu bow.
