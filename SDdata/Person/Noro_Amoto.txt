'''Noro Amoto''' was a [[samurai]] mercenary from [[Kozakura]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was commander of the [[Bushido (organization)|Bushido]] mercenary army.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|119|Noro Amoto}}

==History==
Noro Amoto founded the [[Bushido (organization)|Bushido]] army to defend the lands of Kara-Tur against the [[Tuigan Horde]] during the [[Horde Wars]] of the late 1350s [[DR]]. They fought capably, and continued marching westward.

After the Tuigan's defeat, Noro was inspired by contact with the west to go on to [[Faerûn]] on a fact-finding mission, hoping to learn more about Faerûnian culture and military techniques. He planned to return to Kara-Tur and report back to Amoto's master in Kozakura.

By the early 1360s [[DR]], they were operating in [[Chessenta]]. The Bushido had fought two inconclusive battles against the [[Renegades]].

==Activities==
Noro accepted only honorable work and was picky over what contracts he took. His soldiers followed the code of [[bushido]] at all times and never looted the dead.

==Personality==
Noro commanded with a firm hand and total authority tempered by wisdom and skill.

==Possessions==
He wielded a ''+2 [[katana]]'', wore [[o-yoroi]] armor, and had a [[daikyu]] bow.
