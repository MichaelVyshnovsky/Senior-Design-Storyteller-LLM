        "mainbody": "Aluar Zendos () was a ranger of Mielikki in Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.\nAluar was a quiet man with an uncompromising hatred of evil creature. He did not know what would be his destiny but sensed it lay in Waterdeep.\nAluar had recently acquired a singing sword, and it led him to go first to the New Olamn bards and then to the Harpers. Among them, he befriended Vedellen Hawkhand.\nAluar usually stayed at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger when in the city. He normally worked as a guide or guard to caravans that traveled to and from the North, Westgate or Amn. When in Waterdeep, Aluar frequented the inns and taverns in the Trades Ward."
