'''Minak al-Zafyi''' ran a small shop within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Minak was a tall and handsome [[elf]].

==Activities==
Minak sold exotic animals within the Grand Bazaar from his small tent. Customers could purchase [[monkey]]s, [[songbird]]s, [[falcon]]s, partridges, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, and peacocks. His most prized animal was a young [[elephant bird]]. Though he only kept smaller animals in his tent, he boasted that he could acquire any animal that a customer asked about.

He judged people based upon how his animals reacted to them. Thus, anyone well-received by his animals usually got a better deal.

==Possessions==
Minak owned a ''[[ring of mammal control]]'' and a ''[[net of snaring]]''.
