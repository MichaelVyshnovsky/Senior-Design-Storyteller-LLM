Minak al-Zafyi ran a small shop within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Minak was a tall and handsome elf.
Minak sold exotic animals within the Grand Bazaar from his small tent. Customers could purchase monkeys, songbirds, falcons, partridges, cats, dogs, and peacocks. His most prized animal was a young elephant bird. Though he only kept smaller animals in his tent, he boasted that he could acquire any animal that a customer asked about.
He judged people based upon how his animals reacted to them. Thus, anyone well-received by his animals usually got a better deal.
Minak owned a ring of mammal control and a net of snaring.
