Admiral '''Marianon Silmara''' was one of the ambassadors from the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]] to the city of [[Bral]] during the reign of Prince [[Andru]].

==Description==
Admiral Silmara was a very tall [[elf]] of great strength. She had black hair and a beautiful face. She often dressed in magical [[plate armor]] and wore a ''[[cloak of displacement]]''.

==Personality==
Marianon felt like she was too prestigious for her position as emissary, though she did recognize the importance of the [[Rock of Bral]] as a strategic location for the Elven Navy, and she wished for an excuse to occupy the Rock with the force of a couple of heavy [[spelljamming]] warships. She found Prince [[Andru]] both shortsighted and selfish.

To all outside appearances, however, Marianon was charming and witty—if a bit blunt—though she could come across as condescending to "lesser" races such as [[human]]s.

==Abilities==
Marianon was both a superb [[fighter]] and an accomplished [[mage]]. Among her most powerful spells known were ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'' and ''[[mass suggestion]]''.

==Relationships==
Marianon was assisted by her chief aide, [[Gaeredan Celedir]], who was usually found in her presence.

==Possessions==
Marianon owned a magical [[longsword]] and a ''[[helm of brightness]]'', and she sometimes made use of [[potion of flying|''potions of flying'']] and [[Control undead|''undead control'']].

==History==
Admiral Silmara was a hero of the [[Unhuman Wars]], after which she was appointed as ambassador to Bral, where she served for at least two years.
