'''Barrowin Undurr''' was a devoted [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] of [[Gorm Gulthyn]]. Along with several other [[adventurer]]s, she played a vital role in thwarting the schemes of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Love is like an axe through the heart|Barrowin.}}

==Personality==
She had a dour outlook on life but would always stand against [[evil]], especially when it moved against dwarvenkind.

==Possessions==
Barrowin took immaculate care of her weapons and armor. She never let them become rusty.

She kept a single [[gem]] along with her during her travels, and had regular conversations with it. It was unknown whether or not the gem ever reciprocated.

==History==
===Early Life===
Barrowin was born in the area of the [[Great Rift]], and she managed her family's business holdings in [[Ironmaster]] near [[Icewind Dale]]. She spent fifteen years there on assignment in [[Ironstar]]. Her life was not exciting enough for her, so she asked her family for relocation. When that request went unheard, she called on her deity to provide a new path.

Gorm answered indirectly. Barrowin found a new life, by falling in love with [[Storn Skulldark]], a wealthy young Ironstar dwarf. Barrowin and Storn set out from Ironstar to build a fortress along the route from [[Neverwinter]] to Icewind Dale, within the [[Spine of the World]] mountain range.

The project had many setbacks, chief of which was the sudden disappearance of Storn Skulldark's fortune in [[Ironmaster]]. Storn traveled back without Barrowin to find his missing gold. During his journey he was attacked and carried off by a [[white dragon]]. His fate was unknown. Barrowin was devastated by this loss. She left Ironmaster, and joined the [[Order of the Gauntlet]].

===Tyranny of Dragons===

Some time in the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Barrowin served as the Order of the Gauntlet's representative on a mission to stop the Cult of the Dragon from retrieving the ''[[Red Dragon Mask]]''. Along with her new companions, [[Alaeros Margaster]] and [[Nymmestra Durothil]], Barrowin traveled from [[Neverwinter]] back to Icewind Dale to stop the Cult.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 1}} There the trio picked up two more allies, [[Ratshadow]] and [[Talon Everhale]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 2}} and found out the cult had uncovered a stone-arch ''[[portal]]'' that granted them passageway to the isle of [[Tuern]]. Eventually, Barrowin and her four allies acquired full knowledge about the Cult of the Dragon's ultimate plan.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 3}}

While on Tuern, Barrowin and her allies ventured into the [[Flame Fault]] and slew [[Lostmauth]],{{ToD-Lost}} one of the isle's three [[red dragon]] overlords.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 4}} Their efforts were in vain however, as the cult's leader [[Severin Silrajin]] acquired the ''Red Dragon Mask'' and fled back to Neverwinter.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 5}} 

While they were stranded for a short while,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 6}} and stashed it at [[Ulbrinter Villa]] in [[Waterdeep]] for his [[Zhentarim]] masters.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 7}} Barrowin and her three remaining allies followed the trail of the cult to Waterdeep, but arrived at the Waterdhavian manor too late to save its [[Arthagast Ulbrinter|noble lord]]. They did however find [[Varramzord]], one of the cult's [[wyrmspeaker]]s, and learned that Severin had completed the ''[[Mask of the Dragon Queen]]'' and was ready to summon [[Tiamat]] from the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 8}}

Barrowin and her fellow adventurers joined the allied forces of the [[Sword Coast]] in a great battle against the Cult of the Dragon at the [[Well of Dragons]]. While Tiamat briefly appeared on [[Faer√ªn]] from the depths of the Nine Hells, she was quickly defeated.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}}{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}
