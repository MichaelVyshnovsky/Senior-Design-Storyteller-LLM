Mechezarin was a great wyrm dragon.
The dragon lived in a large room carved out underneath Durlags Tower, along with other magical beasts that Durlag kept in his bestiary. The massive beast eventually died, but its vast skeleton continued to rest deep underneath Durlags Tower. It was guarded by numerous wyverns.
