'''Rewcol''' was a [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Shadow Thieves]] in [[Eshpurta]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
The shadow thief was a sort of misanthrope. He thought that most people were like pathetic sheep and deserved (and needed) people like him to guide and direct them.

==Activities==
The wizard worked as an enforcer, punishing those who went against the rule of his boss in the city.
