Rewcol was a wizard and a member of the Shadow Thieves in Eshpurta around 1370 DR.
The shadow thief was a sort of misanthrope. He thought that most people were like pathetic sheep and deserved (and needed) people like him to guide and direct them.
The wizard worked as an enforcer, punishing those who went against the rule of his boss in the city.
