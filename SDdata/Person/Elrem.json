        "mainbody": "'''Elrem the Wise''' ({{Pronounce|ELL|rem|refs=}}) was the powerful [[shaman]] of the [[Great Worm Tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] barbarians in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He was described as a gigantic [[bat]]-winged snake with the head of a [[red dragon]], but in his normal form was an Uthgardt [[human]].",
        "Abilities": "Being a shaman of Uthgar, Elrem was capable of ''[[wild shape|shapechanging]]'' like a [[druid]] into the form of his tribe's beast totem, the Great Worm. While in this form he possessed a number of psionic powers, including ''[[astral projection (psionic)|astral projection]]'', ''[[clairvoyance (psionic)|clairvoyance]]'', ''[[dimension walk]]'', ''[[empathy (psionic)|empathy]]'', ''[[precognition]]'',''[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]]'' and ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' both state that the \"great worm\" form confers a number of psionic powers to Uthgar shamans. The powers listed are nearly the same as those that were originally detailed for Elrem back in ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'' &ndash; ''animal telepathy'' being the one exception, as it was the only power not to make the transition from 1{{st}} to 2{{nd}} edition [[AD&D]]. From this it can be inferred that Elrem's psionic powers are not unique to him. and ''[[animal telepathy]]''.",
        "Activities": "He resided permanently at the Great Worm Tribe's ancestor mound, the [[Great Worm Cavern]].\n\nHe seemed to only rouse himself for the annual [[runemeet]], to lead the tribe's celebrations, and to prophesize the future. Through his leadership, the tribe chose [[evil]] creatures as their spiritual enemies.",
        "History": "When Elrem transformed into the great worm form it came as a shock and a mystery to the Great Worm Tribe as to what had occured. They believed that, either through pious devotion or the prayers of his followers, Elrem had became an embodiment of the totem spirit of his tribe, perhaps even becoming the deity himself. Some legends spread that he was a son of Uthgar himself and that his beast powers were a gift from his father.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, an [[adventuring company]] sponosred by the [[Zhentarim]] broke into the Great Worm Cavern and slew Elrem the Wise with the use of foul magics. His fellow tribesmen descended upon the evil [[adventurer]]s, seeking to avenge their shaman. Three of the adventurers managed to escape with ''[[teleport]]ation'' magic, taking a significant chunk of treasure with them.\n\nElrem's successor, [[Themrin]], would claim to the rest of the Great Worm Tribe that Elrem's [[spirit]] had spoken with him and promised that  he would continue to watch over the tribe now that his mortal form was destroyed\". Scales from Elrem's would go on to be made into two sets of [[scale armor|armor]] that would be worn by Themrin and the chieftain of the Great Worm Tribe, [[Gweshen Talistars]]. However, both would deny having made the armor, whilst Themrin would additionally claim that this use of his body was ordained from a dream vision. It would go on to be common consensus among the Great Worm Tribe that the suits of armor had simply appeared one day outside the Great Worm Cavern.\n\nThe tragic death of Elrem and the appearance of the scale armor would later be recounted for the wider public of [[Faerûn]] in the pages of ''[[History of the North]]'s'' seventh volume."
