        "mainbody": "oncettina Delcasio, formerly Concettina Delcasio Frostmantle, was Queen of Damara in the late 15th Century DR.\nConcettina was a willowy young woman in the mid-to-late 1480s DR who looked the part of a queen, though also looked much younger than her stated age of twenty five years. She was three decades younger than her husband, King Yarin Frostmantle of Damara, and struggled to blunt his outbursts and rages.\nConcettina was attended by several ladies-in-waiting at the royal castle, several of whom gossiped and plotted behind her back, but she didnt have many friends. One of her closest relationships in Helgabal was with the castle gardener, Pikel Bouldershoulder. She also had a favorite attendant, named Anamarin.\nHer relationship with her husband Yarin was far from positive, as he did not value her as a person, but rather only as a breeding mare and, to a lesser extent, as a trophy. As he grew yet older, and began to neglect his personal hygiene, she only grew to loathe him more. She also was not fond of the Kings sister, Princess Acelya Frostmantle, who spied on her in her bedchamber to report back to the King.\nHer mother, Chianca Delcasio, had died in childbirth, as had her brother, when Concettina was still a little girl. She deluded herself into thinking that her father, Lord Corrado Delcasio, had not married her off to such a beast as Yarin knowingly, that he had only done so in his grief at the loss of his wife, and so remained his loving daughter, placing her hopes in him to get her out of Damara when she began to suspect that her life was in danger. \nConcettina was from Delthuntle in Aglarond. Her father had arranged for her marriage in return for a trade agreement.\nThe Morada Topolino, at the request of Lord Delcasio, whod been smuggled a letter Concettina had penned asking to be rescued, conspired to get her out of Damara or, failing that, get her pregnant with a child whom she could claim was King Yarins before Yarin executed her. Posing as merchants, Morada Topolino agent Spider Paraffin, and his human friend Wulfgar, posed as merchants to get access to King Yarins court. Unfortunately for all involved, at the same time, a grand conspiracy to replace surface rulers with demons had just begun. Upon realizing that Concettina couldnt be safely extracted from Damara, Wulfgar was instead snuck into Concettinas bedchamber. Concettinas body had however already been possessed by Malcanthet, Queen of the succubi, with Concettinas consciousness trapped in a gemstone phylactery.\nShortly thereafter Malcanthet was confronted by a suspicious King Yarins soldiers and revealed her demonic form. Malcanthet fled Helgabal for the spriggan realm of Smeltergard beneath the Galena Mountains, taking Concettina and Wulfgar with her. A rescue attempt was mounted, with Spider eventually managing to put Concettinas consciousness back into her own body, where she engaged in a battle of wills with Malcanthet. During the struggle, the Succubus Queen eventually possessed a goblins body, and, thanks to some clever trickery, then fled back to the Abyss, leaving Concettina in control of herself once more. Before she could be brought safely out of Smeltergard though, Concetinna and most of her rescuers were witness to an avatar of Lolth coming through a portal, who tortured the young woman and her companions by stringing them up in webbing full of venomous spiders. Thankfully, they were all soon freed, and Lolth left them alive.\nKing Frostmantle though was waiting outside of Smeltergard with his army, demanding that Concettina and Wulfgar be tried for treason for cuckolding him. Back in Helgabal though, Yarin was assassinated by Artemis Entreri. To avoid a painful Damaran interregnum, the Court advisors, Dreylil Andrus and Red Mazzie, conspired to clear Concettina of any wrongdoing by claiming that the King died of heartstop and quickly finding her innocent of all charges of cuckolding him. She was then declared sole ruler of Damara.The events of Hero appear to conclude in 1487 DR, however Yarin Frostmantle is still described as king of Damara in the Sword Coast Adventurers Guide, understood to be set in 1489 DR."
