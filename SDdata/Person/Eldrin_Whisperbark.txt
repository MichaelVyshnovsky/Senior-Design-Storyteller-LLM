'''Eldrin Whisperbark''' was a young quarter-[[elf]] [[human]] farmer of the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was also a [[Scion of the Green Regent]].

==Home==
The Whisperbark family lived on a sizeable farm west of Loudwater and south of the [[Delimbiyr River]]. It faced onto the river and had several fields, pasturage, and an orchard. The farmhouse lay at the center close to some [[oak]] trees.

==History==
At the ceremony for the choosing of the [[Green Regent]] on [[Shieldmeet]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Eldrin was among the volunteers and was accepted as a Scion, which he was quite happy about.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}<ref group="note">Implied to be a Scion in 1371, Eldrin was most likely accepted in the 1368 ceremony. It is possible he served under [[Galaer Grasswave]] in the [[Night of the Blood Moon]] battle. He is apparently still a Scion after the 1372 ceremony, suggesting he was accepted again. However, it is unclear if Scions hold their titles for life or for only four years.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Eldrin was one of a band Scions who tried to trail the [[Half-Elven Renegades]] following one of their raids. However, the Renegades turned and ambushed them, and while the other Scions escaped, Eldrin was captured and held for ransom. His family paid the ransom and he was released.

==Personality==
Eldrin was rather charming. His mother was pressuring him to get married and settle down, so he would flirt with any attractive woman (human, elf, or [[half-elf]]) he met, but only if she was receptive. He was a faithful follower of [[Mielikki]].

==Description==
He was quite handsome and fine-featured, with his eyes indicating his elvish heritage. His captivity by the Renegades left him with a scar down the outside of one arm and another across his belly. While a Scion of the Green Regent, Eldrin bore the holy symbol of [[Mielikki]] upon his brow, glowing emerald.

==Activities==
Eldrin did farm-work, wood-chopping, and chores during the day. During the evenings, he was a regular of the [[Merry Mer-She]] tavern, where he joked and drank with his friends.
