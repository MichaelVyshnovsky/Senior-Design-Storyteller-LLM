        "mainbody": "'''Queen Arhymeria Ithal''' was the wife of King [[Nishan Ithal II]] of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Description": "Arhymeria was an exquisitely beautiful [[Calishite]] woman and also a loving and compassionate one.",
        "Abilities": "She was a wizard, a student of Princess [[Rhynda Ithal]] and a better one than her grandfather ever was. She was the creator of the royal artifact known as  [[Arhymeria's  Dagger]], and she also developed several peaceful and fun spells.",
        "Family": "Arhymeria was born Arhymeria yr Una el Shoon, the youngest daughter of [[Akkabar Shoon the Elder]]'s oldest sonThe timeline in [[Calimport (sourcebook)|''Calimport'']] calls Arhymeria Akkabar the Elder's daughter in one location; however, she is his granddaughter in another location in that same sourcebook, and ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' is very clear that she is his granddaughter, implying that the first reference in ''Calimport'' is an error. She had an older brother, [[Akkabar Shoon the Younger|Akkabar]], and a younger brother, [[Amahl Shoon I|Amahl]]. Her nephew, through Akkabar the Younger, was [[Amahl Shoon II]].\n\nShe gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Her third son and youngest child [[Clovis Ithal II (prince)|Clovis']] descendants lived in exile until the fall of the [[Shoon Imperium]].",
        "Relationships": "Arhymeria was happily married to Nishan. She had little contact with her Calishite family, with the exception of her younger brother Amahl.",
        "History": "When Arhymeria was only four-years-old, she was engaged to be married to [[Nishan Ithal II]], grandson of Princess Rhynda Ithal, as part of a treaty orchestrated by Akkabar the Elder to support the regency of Rhynda, Akkabar's former tutor, until Nishan would come of age. She grew up in the royal palace of Tethyr as a lady-in-waiting.\n\nSecretly, Akkabar the Elder intended to use his granddaughter to steal magic from his former tutor Rhynda, but Arhymeria grew close to Rhynda and was a better student of hers than Akkabar ever was. Akkabar soon gave up on his plan to use Arhymeria, considering her, in his own words, an \"insolent and traitorous\" granddaughter.\n\nArhymeria and Nishan were married at the end of [[Kythorn]] in the [[-64 DR|Year of Gleaming Frost, &minus;64 DR]], when they each were fifteen-years-old, the age of majority in Tethyr, becoming queen.\n\nNishan and Arhymeria had their five children over the next seven years, and the kingdom was at peace.\n\nDuring her husband's 73{{rd}} birthday celebration in the [[-6 DR|Year of Scarlet Scourges]], Arhymeria, Nishan, and all but four members of the royal family were killed during a siege of the castle of [[Ithalyr]] by [[Clan Fyrson]] and their hired pirates. These four survivors were spared because of the wise planning of Queen Arhymeria and the help of an [[Elf|elven]] woman named [[Ochyllyss Bormul]]. Arhymeria led the survivors to a secret room in the castle and placed two of her grandchildren and her great-grandson [[Yardane Ithal|Yardane]], heir to the throne, into the care of Ochyllus. She also gave Ochyllus the [[Shield of Silvam]] and a magic dagger she created that could only be wielded by someone of royal blood of [[House Ithal]]. The elven woman would raise Yardane among the [[Suldusk]] elves of the [[Forest of Tethir]].\n\nDespite the fact that Arhymeria saved the royal line of Tethyr from extinction, because Tethyr soon after came under the control of the Shoon Imperium, her blood family, for centuries most Tethyrians believed that Arhymeria was a traitor who orchestrated her husband's death. Even though her innocence was proven when the Imperium fell, it was perpetuated by the inaccurate ''[[Chronicla Tethyria]]'' of [[Alemander III]]. This false belief earned her terrible nicknames, such as the Betrayer, the False Queen, and Tethyr's Bane. The true history of Arhymeria was written down by King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] in [[1370 DR]] as part of his ''[[Historia Tethyra]]'', in an attempt to clear her name. Haedrak theorized that it was because she had prepared entertaining spells for her husband's birthday that she was unable to help defend the castle with her magic.\n\nAfterward, her brother Amahl took the throne, as orchestrated by the wicked Pasha Akkabar Shoon the Elder. Amahl refused to obey his grandfather's orders, however, because of his love for and in honor of the memory of his sister."
