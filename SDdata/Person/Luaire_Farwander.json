        "mainbody": "Luaire Farwander was a yuan-ti pureblood spy who assumed a guise of a merchant who worked alongside SaSani in her trading company in Samargol circa 1374 DR.\nIn his human shape, Farwander appeared as an unremarkable sinuous male with a meek and nervous personality. However, these qualities and even his appearance were nothing but an illusion and act. His true monstrous form was that of a green-scaled snake-featured humanoid with serpentine vertical slits. His typical yuan-ti pureblood appearance was accentuated by his cold, calculating demeanor and hostile expression.\nLuaire claimed that his magical abilities were nothing more than dabbling. This was another lie. Farwander was a capable wizard, a talented spy, and an expert poisoner.\nIn Samarach, Luaire utilized a potent and almost undetectable potion called chokemist, a rare substance he gathered in the Chokemist Cave where Luaire had a hide out along enthralled corrupted giant spiders and poisonous plant spores. The yuan-ti carried an enchanted dagger called a saboteurs stiletto.\nLuaire was hired as an assistant and trade supervisor for the merchant leader SaSani of Samarach sometime shortly before the . Under her orders, Luaire traveled across Samarach, and more exotic locations such as Calimport, along with the merchant companys shipments to negotiate deals and forge agreements. The voyage to Calimport was a failure for the company, resulting in the full loss of merchant cargo.\nIn 1374 DR, Luaire Farwander sailed aboard Captain Lastri Kassirehs Vigilant from the Sword Coast to the Chultan nation of Samarach. Luaire was tasked to bring the famous writer Volothamp Geddarm, who did business with SaSani who recently opened a branch of her company in the Crossroad Keep. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels ruptured, a crewmember named Kellen got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, and new ropes became frayed.\nUnknown to all, Luaire was a yuan-ti spy and saboteur member of House SeSehen that set out to conquer Samarach and the Sword Coast through subterfuge and infiltration to promote the worship of their new deity Zehir. Luaire successfully sabotaged the Vigilant, leading to the ships demise in a fierce storm. Most sailors and passengers perished in the shipwreck, while others survived, and some were abducted by the Chultan cannibalistic Batiri. Luaire Farwander maintained his guise until SaSani tasked a band of wreck survivors to investigate the ships destruction. Eventually, the heroes discovered evidence of sabotage, and after rescuing Captain Kassireh, they had an eyewitness account of Luaires crime.\nDiscovered, the yuan-ti spy fled to the secret Lantan-Samarach portal that connected southern jungles with the Sword Coast. Luaire poisoned the gnome artificer who maintained the portal and hid within nearby caves. He planned for SaSanis hirelings to track him to the Chokemist Cave, where Luaire sprang a trap. He used his chokemist-addicted enthralled giant spiders to attack the adventurers in an attempt to sacrifice them to Zehir. The spys plan was unsuccessful, and he was slain in the process."
