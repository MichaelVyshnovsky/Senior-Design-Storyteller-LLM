        "mainbody": "'''Luaire Farwander''' was a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] spy who assumed a guise of a merchant who worked alongside [[Sa'Sani]] in her trading company in [[Samargol]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "In his [[human]] shape, Farwander appeared as an unremarkable sinuous male with a meek and nervous personality. However, these qualities and even his appearance were nothing but an ''[[illusion]]'' and act. His true monstrous form was that of a green-scaled snake-featured [[humanoid]] with serpentine vertical slits. His typical yuan-ti pureblood appearance was accentuated by his cold, calculating demeanor and hostile expression.",
        "Abilities": "Luaire claimed that his magical abilities were nothing more than dabbling. This was another lie. Farwander was a capable [[wizard]], a talented spy, and an expert [[poison]]er.",
        "Possessions": "In Samarach, Luaire utilized a potent and almost undetectable potion called [[chokemist]], a rare substance he gathered in the [[Chokemist Cave]] where Luaire had a hide out along enthralled corrupted [[giant spider]]s and poisonous plant spores. The yuan-ti carried an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] called a ''[[saboteur's stiletto]]''.",
        "History": "Luaire was hired as an assistant and trade supervisor for the merchant leader Sa'Sani of [[Samarach]] sometime shortly before the {{Yearlink|1374}}. Under her orders, Luaire traveled across Samarach, and more exotic locations such as [[Calimport]], along with the merchant company's shipments to negotiate deals and forge agreements. The voyage to Calimport was a failure for the company, resulting in the full loss of merchant cargo.\n\nIn 1374 DR, Luaire Farwander sailed aboard Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]]'s ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' from the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Chult]]an nation of Samarach. Luaire was tasked to bring the famous writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]], who did business with Sa'Sani who recently opened a branch of her company in the [[Crossroad Keep]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels ruptured, a crewmember named [[Kellen (sailor)|Kellen]] got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, and new ropes became frayed.\n\nUnknown to all, Luaire was a yuan-ti spy and saboteur member of [[House Se'Sehen]] that set out to conquer Samarach and the Sword Coast through subterfuge and infiltration to promote the worship of their new deity [[Zehir]]. Luaire successfully sabotaged the ''Vigilant'', leading to the ship's demise in a fierce storm. Most sailors and passengers perished in the shipwreck, while others survived, and some were abducted by the Chultan cannibalistic [[Batiri]]. Luaire Farwander maintained his guise until Sa'Sani tasked a band of wreck survivors to investigate the ship's destruction. Eventually, the heroes discovered evidence of sabotage, and after rescuing Captain Kassireh, they had an eyewitness account of Luaire's crime.\n\nDiscovered, the yuan-ti spy fled to the secret ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' that connected southern jungles with the Sword Coast. Luaire poisoned the [[gnome]] [[artificer]] who maintained the ''[[portal]]'' and hid within nearby caves. He planned for Sa'Sani's hirelings to track him to the Chokemist Cave, where Luaire sprang a trap. He used his chokemist-addicted enthralled giant spiders to attack the adventurers in an attempt to sacrifice them to Zehir. The spy's plan was unsuccessful, and he was slain in the process."
