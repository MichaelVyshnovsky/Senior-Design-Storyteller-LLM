        "mainbody": "Baron '''Phen Do''', called '''the Outlaw''', was a rebellious noble of the city of [[Khampo]] in [[Tabot]].",
        "History": "Wanting to restore the rule of the nobles over Tabot and depose the High Lord, Phen Do launched a rebellion. In response, the worried Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) stationed three divisions in Khampo to contain the revolt. In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a tortoise-shell divination at [[U'Chan Gompa]] suggested burning rocks would fall on Khampo during Qwa'chein Goh celebrations; they elected not to warn the city, as punishment for its rebellion.<ref name=\"KT78\" >",
        "Activities": "By that year, Phen Do was training his secret army, nicknamed the [[Raccoon-dogs]], hidden in the mountains east of [[Nafeen Gompa]]. They had a base and a form of [[ninja]] school. Through gifts and spies, he had influenced both the Nafeen and [[Zotung Gompa]]s and bribed the Chi-kyap Khempo (the lord chamberlain representing the nobility to the High Lord). Stories spread of Phen Do's exploits and the dzong-pons (sheriffs) of Tabot carried pictures of him.",
        "Description": "He had a strong build and black hair, which he braided and was long enough to hang down his back. He had scars on his left arm and hand, which he concealed by wearing a glove.",
        "Possessions": "Phen Do fought with a magical [[battleaxe]] that he dipped in [[poison]]."
