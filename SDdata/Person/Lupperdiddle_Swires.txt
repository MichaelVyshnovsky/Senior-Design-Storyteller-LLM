'''Lupperdiddle Swires''' was an infamous small and high-vaulting [[gnome|gnomish]] rascal who was active sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lupperdiddle was known for his numerous daring raids and burglaries of henhouses. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, and [[enchanted]] pair of boots called ''[[Swiresy shoes]]'' was in existence, possibly created and named in tribute to the diminutive cavorting [[thief]]. Another item from Lupperdiddle's adventuring career was called ''[[Swires' Sledboard]]'', a flat [[shield]] that he once used to slide down a slope, away from his enemies. This shield would end up in stock at the [[Rivington General]] shop of [[Baldur's Gate]].
