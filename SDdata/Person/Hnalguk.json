She embodied the reckless nature and tactics of her forces.\nHnalguk led her advance forces in the battle between Mrolgyets Legion and the Lords Alliance on Harvestshield Mountain. They were briefly slowed by packs of local ghouls before they began to scour the mountainside for Alliance troops. She was defeated in combat by a group of adventurers from Waterdeep."
