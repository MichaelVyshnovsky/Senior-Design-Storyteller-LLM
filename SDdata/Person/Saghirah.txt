Saghirah was a viziers turban living in Simbaya in north Zakhara in 1367 DR.
When not in the form of a turban, Saghirah appeared to be a snake-like creature.
Saghirah formed a symbiotic relationship with the ruler of Simbaya, Hayfa al-Simbaya.
She spent most of her time in utter boredom since Hayfa rarely wore her. Saghirah ultimately decided to leave Hayfa and seek a new host.
