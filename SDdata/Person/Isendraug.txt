Isendraug was a white dragon enslaved by the frost giants sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Isendraug lived with her mate Cryovain in Svardborg.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, frost giant minions of Jarl Storvald reclaimed the place during an absence of Isendraug and Cryovain and took the opportinity to steal all their eggs. Storvald blackmailed the two white dragons into obeying his orders or face the destruction of their eggs.
Isendraug was always plotting a means of freeing herself and making the giants paying for their crimes.
