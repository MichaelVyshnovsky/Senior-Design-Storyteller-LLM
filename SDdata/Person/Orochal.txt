'''Orochal''' was a [[pit fiend]] of [[Avernus]].

==Abilities==
He had proven inexplicably resistant to electricity.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1372}}, Orochal was the first guardian to whelm a force against [[the Simbul]] when she tried to rescue [[Elminster Aumar]] from [[Avernus]]. Though her first spell didn't damage him much, and left him laughing in fact, her second spell tore him apart.
