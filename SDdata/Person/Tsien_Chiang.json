        "mainbody": "Tsien Chiang was a necromancer who formerly lived somewhere in Kara-Tur and later became the darklord of ICath in the Demiplane of Dread. Though lost from Kara-Tur, her name survived there as practically a byword for evil.\nTsien was born the only daughter of a prince of the province of ICath. She was intelligent, proud, and fearless, and despite her fathers thinking that women were only good for making children and forbidding her from receiving such education, she secretly learned the military arts from veteran fighters and killers and magic from mighty wu jen masters of necromancy, as well as poisoncraft. At this time, she became fascinated by the number four, and its mystical relationship with death. Yet still her father belittled her ambitions, and her indignation soon turned to an intense hatred of first her father and then of all men.\nShe eventually murdered her father with a concoction of four lethal and agonizing poisons, and then used her magic to turn her mother and three brothers into imbeciles. Thus, Tsien Chiang was acclaimed the ruler of ICath by the local elders, who would rather see her as lord than one of her feebleminded family members. She soon ruled that province as a notorious and utterly inflexible tyrant.\nthumb|left|250px|A young Tsien with one of her suspecting samurai suitors.\nNevertheless, many men sought marriage to the beautiful and powerful lord and came to her as suitors. Tsien Chiang accepted only high-ranked samurai and when she had four suitors at a time, she demanded they fight to the death in an arena. On the rare occasion one man survived, Tsien claimed this unfortunate as her husband, did with him as she willed until he had fathered a female infant, then slew him through trickery, magic, combat, or poison. Once she had had four husbands and had had four daughters, Tsien declared she would receive no more suitors, if any were even still willing. In any case, as her beauty faded, men grew less attracted to her, and she detested them all the more. Of her four daughters, three of them—named Scream, Hate, and Spite—grew to be evil like Tsien, but foolish and easily controlled by her, and served as her handmaidens. The fourth was an unbearable disappointment, for she was of good and pure heart Nightingale, who was named for her sweet singing voice.\nTsien began to fear death as she noticed herself age and her beauty fade. She gathered the finest sages from all over Kara-Tur to help her uncover the secrets of the number four to her satisfaction in many hours of discussion and research. Almost all were unsuccessful and so she had them slowly tortured to death. One however suggested looking to the trees for answers, as they had seen the passing of the four seasons countless times. This was an idea that appealed to Tsien—rather than torture that sage, she had him killed relatively quickly, by being chopped into pieces with the remains consumed in the fireplace. Very few sages visited ICath after that, let alone came back.\nIn time, Tsien Chiang was the most dreaded, distrusted, and despised individual in all of Kara-Tur. As a tactical genius and supremely powerful wizard, she handily defeated the neighboring princes who allied against her and attempted to overthrow her evil rule, taking their lands as her own and making her one of the most powerful persons in Kara-Tur too. Those who didnt attack her, the emperor, local princes, and rulers of other lands, were compelled to pay homage to appease her, but those lords too were often murdered. Because of binding oaths of loyalty from her clan to the emperor that even she did not dare break and was begrudgingly forced to uphold, Tsien spared the emperor, but she was feared even by him.\nAmong this tribute were a number of fruit trees from the kings of southern Kara-Tur. Keeping only four of these plants alive, Tsien enchanted them with dark magic, so they smelled of death and cursed those who came close. In addition, Tsien demanded from the emperor four bells, the biggest in the empire and all sacred relics housed in great shrines. The fearful emperor granted them to her, despite the angry protests and curses of the priests and his people. She used her powers to place the spirits of her four daughters, Hate, Scream, Spite, and Nightingale, into the four bells, as well as a part of her own spirit to ensure that her daughters could not escape. Her daughters soulless bodies survived, but completely under their mothers control. Because the bells were forged to be used by the immortal gods, imbuing them with part of her spirit finally meant that Tsien and her daughters bodies never again aged a day. The corrupted bells became known as The Bells of Evil and Lament and Tsien rang them four times a year in hopes of hearing the secret of the number four in their sound.\nStill suitors came to claim the hands and hearts of Hate, Scream, Spite, and Nightingale, and all were forced to kill each other for the entertainment of Tsien and her three evil daughters. The survivors were killed off in more inventive ways. Over many years, Tsien used the remains of these suitors to build herself a ghastly palace the structure made from their bones, the walls painted with their blood, the carpets weaved from their hair, and the clothing from their skin and flesh. The floors cried in madness and pain when stepped on. A giant-sized backgammon board had dice and pieces made from fingernails and painted skulls. Even the broken promises of men, \"the one substance that the world has in limitless abundance\", she used to erect a tower. While Hate, Scream, and Spite liked it, when her despairing and horrified good daughter Nightingale complained, her empty body was beaten. \nEven the gods despised Tsien—for her lack of faith, her desecration of their shrines, and the beatings she gave Nightingale, whose voice they loved. They plagued ICath with storms whenever Nightingale was beaten. But prideful Tsien disdained even them. She hated the gods, whom she believed were deliberately withholding the truth of the number four from her.\nFinally, Nightingale dared question Tsien four times, and for this she was beaten four times, once each by her three sisters and then by her mother, who this time tried to utterly destroy her body. Nightingale cried out for mercy and help, and thick fog enveloped the Palace of Bone. Certain the gods were working to cast her down to the Nine Hells, Tsien blasphemed against the gods and denied them. When the emperor finally plucked up the courage to intervene, she laughed and killed him, thereby breaking her sacred oaths of loyalty. Nightingales body escaped destruction and was imprisoned in the Tower of Broken Promises.\nWith these four ultimate sins, the fog that had engulfed her palace tore the land of ICath out of Kara-Tur and carried it into the Demiplane of Dread in the year 732 BC. The dark powers of that place made it a domain there, with Tsien Chiang as its darklord. No one else lived there except her, her daughters, and their remaining victims.\nShe was not sure where this place was, let alone what it was, but she was eager to start conquering it. Over the years since, Tsien Chiang cultivated her powers, became one with the land, and gathered monstrous creatures and evil spirits to serve her, such as tree spirits as her servants and handmaidens.\nAll she needed next were some new bones to fix the walls and some fresh blood to give them a lick of paint.\nIn her youth, Tsien was fearless, proud, and spirited, as well as keenly intelligent and disobedient to her strict father. She grew to have an unbreakable will and a drive to dominate everything and everyone, but also to be sadistic, cruel and selfish. Tsien was also a determined misandrist, as a response to his disdain for women. She wanted to force all men to submit to her will, or else destroy them. Even those men who did pay homage and swear eternal fealty to her did not survive her and her daughters long. She hated all visitors to her realm and only those who paid homage with impressive gifts might be allowed to depart again and keep their lives. It was very unlikely shed make an agreement with anyone, least of all men.\nAbove all, she was obsessed with the number four, which in her language used the same character as the word for \"death\". This held mystical significance the four winds brought storms, ice, dust, and heat, and the four curses of despair, malice, misfortune, and pestilence were written on scrolls of the gods. Some people, those familiar with the secrets of life and death, feared the number four where it occurred, while a few, such as Tsien, were fascinated. She was driven to learn its secrets. She believed that death was all powerful compared to life, as was darkness to light, that the numbers held the key, of which four was the greatest, and that by mastering the secrets of the number four, she too would become all powerful. Thus, every terrible thing Tsien did, she did in fours.\nAs well as being a mistress of dark magic, since becoming a darklord of the Demiplane of Dread, Tsien could transform herself into a terrible evil treant. She could look through any tree in the land to spy on trespassers. Despite her control over the land, she apparently lacked a means of closing the borders of her domain. She commanded great magic and wielded only a dagger. She could only be slain when all four of the Bells of Evil and Lament were destroyed, and this took at least a disintegrate or limited wish spell. Otherwise, she reformed in a few minutes, fully intact and with all her spells.\nShe spent her days engaged in the darkest magics and in watching the suffering and deaths of her victims. She believed her powers kept the gods out of her domain, not knowing they were absent altogether, and therefore maintained her warding spells. \nThough famously beautiful in her youth, Tsien was described as sharp and hard of features later in life as her iron will and dominance shone through."
