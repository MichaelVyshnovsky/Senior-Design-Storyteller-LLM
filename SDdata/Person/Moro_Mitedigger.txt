Moro Mitedigger was a swindler in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
Based in the Hall of Wonder, Moro sold malfunctioning devices and swindled customers in surrounding towns. The leader of the Legendary Campaign came across some of the victims and heard their story, then went to the Hall of Wonder to stop Moro, with the two waging a bloodforge battle there.
