'''Moro Mitedigger''' was a swindler in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Based in the [[Hall of Wonder (Utter East)|Hall of Wonder]], Moro sold malfunctioning devices and swindled customers in surrounding towns. The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] came across some of the victims and heard their story, then went to the Hall of Wonder to stop Moro, with the two waging a [[bloodforge]] battle there.
