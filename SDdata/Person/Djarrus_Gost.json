He also served as the silent patron of the Foes of the Fang, an adventuring company dedicated to the eradication of vampires within the civilization of the North.\nDjarrus had short blond hair and beard with fair skin. He was said to always have a \"worried\" look about him. He typically wore the latest Waterdhavian fashions over his slender build.\nDjarrus was  a hunter of vampires throughout the North. He hired many sages to gather any information they could about the vampires infecting the cities of the Lords Alliance and fed this information to his half-sister, Corrina Lathankin and the Foes of the Fang.\nUnbeknownst to any of the Foess members, aside from Corinna and her husband, Jandar Ilbaereth, Djarrus donated money and other resources to the Foes of the Fang. In addition, he provided them with information regarding the activities of a number of vampire groups that operated in the North.\nHe also donated much of the Gost family fortune to the Church of Lathander whom Corinna and Jandar were also members of the Order of the Aster sect of the church.\nEven Djarrus closest friends and family did not know that he had been charmed, and had been provided information about rival vampires by the Master Vampire of Waterdeep, Artor Morlin who was also in the guise of the Gost familys seneschal, Delinth Oberlin."
