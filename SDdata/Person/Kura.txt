Kura was a kobun of the Big Head yakuza gang in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
After an attack by Black Mist yakuza on a shrine protected by Big Heads, Kura gathered around thirty like-minded yakuza to attack the Black Mist headquarters in revenge (an attack that would probably end in tragedy).
Kura was a hot-head with a charming and magnetic personality. Despite being very rash, his eloquence often convinced others to join him.
