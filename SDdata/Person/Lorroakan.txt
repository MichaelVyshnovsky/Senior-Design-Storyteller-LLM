'''Lorroakan''' was a [[mage]] and the owner of [[Ramazith's tower]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The mage was a fairly young redhead.

==Personality==
Lorroakan  was an arrogant man who believed himself to be the only supreme wizard in the world, and that even the gods were not deserving of his admiration. However, he was known for being rather poor, despite his expensive tastes, and his short temper.

==Possessions==
He held a magical [[staff]], called the ''[[Despair of Athkatla]]'', with decorations in a style associated with his home [[Athkatla|city]]. He also dressed himself in elaborate red robes with intricate gold embroidery, called the ''[[Shelter of Athkatla]]''.

==Abilities==
Though a somewhat competent mage, it was possible he had not mastered the arcane. Years later, others claimed that he was in fact a master, whilst others denied this. 

He could summon several [[elemental]] [[myrmidon]]s at once, and would channel their elemental power to use an ability called ''elemental retort'' to protect himself from any who dared to attack him. Another magic at Lorroakan's disposal was conjuring a projection, a simulacrum with limited intelligence in his likeness. This glowing, shimmering copy could answer basic questions in relation to the business, sell or buy goods, and perform other tasks programmed by the wizard.

==Activities==
He was a keen [[enchanter]], though he was versed in various schools of [[magic]]. The young magic-user could perform most standard magical services to make coin, though he often enchanted clothes to make them waterproof. There was no chance that Lorroakan would sell his method of enchantment to others.

Lorroakan took apprentices, such as the [[tiefling]] [[Rolan]]. Rolan claimed that Lorroakan was the "greatest [[wizard]] in Baldur's Gate" and that he had admired his arcane skills for years.

==History==
[[File:Lorroakan power posing.png|thumb|''Lorroakan posing for the [[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.''|390x390px]]
Lorroakan was originally from [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]], where arcane magic users were kept in check by the authorities. Due to Lorroakanâ€™s impulsive use of magic, Athkatla authorities watched over his activities, which made the young mage eventually leave his hometown to escape their supervision.

Before Lorroakan assumed control of his tower, the previous owner, [[Ramazith Flamesinger]], mysteriously disappeared, and the residence had been without an owner for decades. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Lorroakan arrived in [[Baldur's Gate]] from [[Athkatla]]. He became the owner of the Tower and the magic items shop [[Sorcerous Sundries]]. However, he did no research and did not share any magical knowledge from the massive tomes stored within the tower.

During or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lorroakan discovered a journal written by the [[necromancer]] [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]], mentioning ''[[soul cage]]'' [[ritual]] magic and the [[Nightsong]]. Intrigued by the magic and potential power he could gain from it, the wizard sent a letter to [[Ketheric Thorm]], Balthazar's superior and the person the Nightsong was linked to. Ketheric replied politely on Balthazar's behalf but declined further demonstration about the magic and the Nightsong. The rejection did not stop Lorroakan from pursuing his ambition. He purchased a magic [[wand]] from a [[Calishite]] [[warlock]] to recreate the ritual. He then advertised for [[adventurer]]s in the city who would take a contract to retrieve the Nightsong for him, offering massive amounts of [[gold]] as payment.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some residents of Baldur's Gate claimed that Lorroakan was, in fact, "[[Tallhat]]," the owner of Baldur's Gate's [[Undercellar]], whilst some instead said that he was a [[Cowled Wizard]] who had been exiled from [[House Selemchant]].
