        "mainbody": "Valas Rrostarr was the bodyguard of Wode the Guileful in his merchant camp of the Underdark in the early 14 century DR.\nHe was the sole protector of Wode in the area south of a House Despana camp, near Rilauven.\nValas was an overprotective and aggressive guard, and often threatened others for the slightest of banter. He did not like to engage in conversation with those who had no relevance to him, apparently because they had no information for him.\nHe protected his employer with a spear in battle."
