        "Activities": "Having given up life as a wizard to become a philosopher, Heptios wandered the streets of Cimbar trying to discuss philosophy with the crowds. He did prefer others' company and conversation to the seclusion of [[magic]]al research.\n\nHeptios had quarters at the [[University]] but preferred to live in friends' houses whilst moving between them regularly. He rarely visited his own quarters except to store [[spell]]s and [[magical item]]s.",
        "Personality": "{{fq\n| text   = In Chessenta, the people are incapable of living a quiet life, or allowing others to live quietly\n| source = Heptios\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n}}\nHeptios argued that passions would lead people into reckless and dangerous behavior, and that emotion must be overcome by rational thought.\n\nIn relation to the [[orc]]s and [[half-orc]]s of [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]], Heptios argued that orcs who adopted [[human]] values might be the greatest threat the Realms had ever known.",
        "Relationships": "{{fq\n| text   = Chessenta is a mosaic of a nation that was made by ten different artists, all of them blindfolded.\n| source = Heptios\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n}}\nNeedless to say, Heptios was hated by Cimbar's Mob and, frankly, he didn't much like them either. The Mob even attempted to kill him on several occasions, but Heptios had a ''[[cube of force]]'' to shield him from all but their abuse.\n\nHeptios led a small group of like-minded philosophers known as the Heptain. They educated others on the importance of philosophy and rationalism compared to superstition.\n\nDespite rumors to the contrary, Heptios disavowed any connection with the [[Numbers Cult]].\n\nImpressively, the [[god]] [[Azuth]], Patron of Mages, was once seen talking with Heptios.",
