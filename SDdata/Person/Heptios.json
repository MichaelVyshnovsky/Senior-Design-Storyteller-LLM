        "mainbody": "Heptios was a mage and philosopher in Cimbar in Chessenta in the midâ€“14 century DR, and the most powerful Chessentan wizard of his day. He was known as \"Heptios the Archmage\".\nHaving given up life as a wizard to become a philosopher, Heptios wandered the streets of Cimbar trying to discuss philosophy with the crowds. He did prefer others company and conversation to the seclusion of magical research.\nHeptios had quarters at the University but preferred to live in friends houses whilst moving between them regularly. He rarely visited his own quarters except to store spells and magical items.\nHeptios argued that passions would lead people into reckless and dangerous behavior, and that emotion must be overcome by rational thought.\nIn relation to the orcs and half-orcs of Airspur, Heptios argued that orcs who adopted human values might be the greatest threat the Realms had ever known.\nNeedless to say, Heptios was hated by Cimbars Mob and, frankly, he didnt much like them either. The Mob even attempted to kill him on several occasions, but Heptios had a cube of force to shield him from all but their abuse.\nHeptios led a small group of like-minded philosophers known as the Heptain. They educated others on the importance of philosophy and rationalism compared to superstition.\nDespite rumors to the contrary, Heptios disavowed any connection with the Numbers Cult.\nImpressively, the god Azuth, Patron of Mages, was once seen talking with Heptios.\nHeptios was an old man, short and fat and bald. He commonly wore brown robes with a hood."
