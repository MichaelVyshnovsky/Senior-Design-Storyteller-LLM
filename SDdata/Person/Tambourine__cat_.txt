'''Tambourine''' was a lazy [[cat]] who lived in the kitchen of the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Hello, servant ape. Would you kill those rats, please? Their presence vexes me.''|Tambourine the Cat}}

==Description==
Tambourine was a white and fluffy creature with huge blue eyes and a pink nose.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Tambourine was "employed" by the cooks of the Elfsong Tavern in vain hopes that the beast would be killing [[rat]]s in the establishment's cellars. However, Tambourine himself showed little interest in pest control or any other vocation. Those who knew mundane or magical ways of talking to animals quickly realized that the lazy cat possessed a self-important attitude, thinking it to be the monarch of the tavern and all humanoids its subservient apes. The cat would also attempt to order said "apes" to dispose of the rats in Elfsong's basement.
