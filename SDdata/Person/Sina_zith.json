        "Description": "Sina'zith was a lanky gith woman with yellowish coloration and gray splotches on her skin. She had blue eyes and light brown hair, braided in tight cornrows.",
        "History": "Sina'zith was an outcast among her kin, owing to her dedication to a certain monastic tradition. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, she came into contact with the Cult of the Absolute and was infected with their altered [[illithid]] tadpole. When Sina'zith's fellow githyanki found out about the infection, she was slain immediately as an aberration. Her soul yearned for revenge and ended up among the hand-picked dozen individuals plucked from the [[Fugue Plane]], chosen by the entity called [[Withers]] to aid in his campaign against the [[Dead Three]] and their Cult of the Absolute."
