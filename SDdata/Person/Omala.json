        "mainbody": "mala was a master colorist at the dye works in Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.\nAround the same time as the death curse, Omala purchased dancing monkey fruit from the black market for the purpose of making dye. Such an act was considered a potentially capital offense (punishable by a sentence to Executioners Run) as it circumvented the legal sale of fruit overseen by the merchant prince Kwayothé. When Omalas actions were uncovered by the Ytepka Society, he planned to go to Goldenthrone to plead for his life before Kwayothé, claiming he had merely experienced a lapse of judgment. He sought to ask adventurers to accompany him for protection, although he lacked the money to hire any."
