        "mainbody": "'''Omala''' was a master [[colorist]] at the [[Dye works (Port Nyanzaru)|dye works]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Around the same time as the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} Omala purchased [[dancing monkey fruit]] from the black market for the purpose of making [[dye]]. Such an act was considered a potentially capital offense (punishable by a sentence to [[Executioner's Run]]) as it circumvented the legal sale of [[fruit]] overseen by the [[Port Nyanzaru#merchant princes|merchant prince]] [[Kwayothé]]. When Omala's actions were uncovered by the [[Ytepka Society]], he planned to go to [[Goldenthrone]] to plead for his life before Kwayothé, claiming he had merely experienced a lapse of judgment. He sought to ask [[adventurer]]s to accompany him for protection, although he lacked the [[money]] to hire any."
