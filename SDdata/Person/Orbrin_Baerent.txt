'''Orbrin Baerent''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]] based in the [[Tower of Luck]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1375 DR]], Orbrin was one of the priests from the Tower of Luck usually assigned to the [[Yawning Portal]] inn, as the proprietor [[Durnan]] paid a daily retainer to the temple for their presence. He provided healing, for a fee, to the [[adventurer]]s returning from [[Undermountain]]. To those adventurers going in, he always offered to chant Tymora's blessings on them.

==Personality==
Over time, Orbrin had grown quite cynical about humankind and the character of people. He remained devoted to Lady Luck, but believed that too many people were oblivious to actual power and too afraid or distrusting of change and so did not take the chances they needed to.

Otherwise, Orbrin liked the atmosphere of the inn, as well as its menu. He was content to pass long periods of time sitting in the common room.Being a gourmand of the appropriate level, Orbrin may be the unnamed fat priest of Tymora mentioned in the RPGA adventure [[Undermountain (LGR)|''Undermountain'']], set in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
He was old and gray-haired.
