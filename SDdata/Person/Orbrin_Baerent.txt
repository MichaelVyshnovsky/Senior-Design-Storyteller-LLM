Orbrin Baerent was a human cleric of Tymora based in the Tower of Luck in Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.
Circa 1375 DR, Orbrin was one of the priests from the Tower of Luck usually assigned to the Yawning Portal inn, as the proprietor Durnan paid a daily retainer to the temple for their presence. He provided healing, for a fee, to the adventurers returning from Undermountain. To those adventurers going in, he always offered to chant Tymoras blessings on them.
Over time, Orbrin had grown quite cynical about humankind and the character of people. He remained devoted to Lady Luck, but believed that too many people were oblivious to actual power and too afraid or distrusting of change and so did not take the chances they needed to.
Otherwise, Orbrin liked the atmosphere of the inn, as well as its menu. He was content to pass long periods of time sitting in the common room.Being a gourmand of the appropriate level, Orbrin may be the unnamed fat priest of Tymora mentioned in the RPGA adventure Undermountain, set in 1372 DR.
He was old and gray-haired.
