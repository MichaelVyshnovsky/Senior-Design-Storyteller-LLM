Baernoth was a turnip farmer and the Elder of the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Baernoth was a very strong man with a gigantic build and a beard.
Despite his build, he was softly spoken, as well as careful and reasonable, yet he seemed to fear nothing in the whole world.
By around 1357 DR, Baernoth had been elected Elder of the villages governing Council. Those of the vale had great respect for Baernoth as such, he was expected to hold the position of Elder for as long as he wished.
