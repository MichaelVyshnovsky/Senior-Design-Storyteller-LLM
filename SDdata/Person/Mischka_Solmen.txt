'''Mischka Solmen''' was a [[human]] acolyte of [[Waukeen]] who helped to oversee the [[Temple of the Coinmaiden]] in [[Phandalin]] following its construction in the {{YearlinkName|1496}}.{{AI-time}}

==Activities==
Alongside fellow acolyte [[Hesten Jenz]], Mischka preached the word of Waukeen during regular services at the Temple of the Coinmaiden.

==Relationships==
Mischka and Hesten oversaw the temple services at the behest of [[Ditch Fundi]], who oversaw the temple's business. Ditch's willingness to defer to the two acolytes was seen by them as a sign of great trust, and they both were fiercely loyal to their boss. In truth, Ditch had ulterior motives and was not truly a member of the [[Church of Waukeen]]; however, Mischka was not aware of this.

==History==
Following the transformation of the old location of [[Barthen's Provisions]] into the Temple of the Coinmaiden in 1496 DR, Mischka and Hesten were charged by Ditch Fundi with the spiritual duties of the temple. With a month, the pair had earned the trust of the townsfolk.
