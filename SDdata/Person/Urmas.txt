Urmas was a stone giant librarian living in Gravenhollow in the late 15 century DR.
Urmas was the busiest of the librarians there.
Urmas regularly kept in touch with all giant communities in the Underdark using a vast network of magically augmented subterranean beasts used as messengers. One of his contacts was Stonekeeper Hgraam in Gracklstugh. He was also in constant contact with all stone giant mystics and some xorn and galeb duhr servants.
Urmas was a patient and polite individual on surface. However he disliked people or things that disturbed his work.
