        "mainbody": "'''Renwick \"Snowcloak\" Caradoon''' was the eldest of the three brothers whose exploits led to the creation of the [[Knights of Samular]] (along with [[Samular Caradoon]] and [[Amphail the Just]]). Renwick eventually died in the last battle of the [[Second Troll War]], only to return as an [[archlich]].",
        "History": "After his descent into undeath, Renwick sought both the ''[[rings of Samular]]'' and ''[[Kezefbane]]''. Although he reunited the rings at one point, all the items were hidden from him by his descendant [[Bronwyn Caradoon|Bronwyn]]. The rings were split up among the Knights of Samular, the [[church of Cyric]], and the [[Harpers]], with ''Kezefbane'' hidden at [[Blackstaff Tower]]. \n\nIn [[1491 DR]], it was discovered that his resting place was within the [[Sacred Stone Monastery]]; however, the monastery was occupied by the [[Cult of the Black Earth]]. The cultists tried to recruit Renwick, but without success. He chose not to act against the cultists and they simply ignored him. Renwick may have later agreed to help a group of adventurers who had infiltrated the monastery defeat the cultists."
