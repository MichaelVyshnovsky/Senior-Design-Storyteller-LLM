        "mainbody": "\"Adera Moonfist\" was a disguised intellect devourer in the Moonsea region.\nLike its master, the mind flayer Vanquo, its main goal was to acquire an artifact from the Elemental Plane of Earth.\nIn 1491 DR, after Vanquo had absorbed all information from Adera Moonfist, it replaced her brain with an intellect devourer. The intellect devourer began recruiting mercenaries and adepts of the Cult of the Black Earth to aid in the search for the Turning Keys treasure in the Flooded Forest. The intellect devourer commanded the mercenaries to start preying upon caravans along the North Road, hoping to gain information.\nHowever, an adventuring party hired to clear the area of bandits confronted and defeated \"her\"."
