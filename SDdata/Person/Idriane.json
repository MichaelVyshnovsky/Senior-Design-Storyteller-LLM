        "mainbody": "Idriane was a knight of Ilmater and one of two women to sit on ruling council of Impiltur, collectively known as the Lords of Imphras II, during the 14 century DR.\nAmong the lords, Idriane served as a temperate voice that strived for moderation. This viewpoint existed in stark contrast to some of the more extreme perspectives that expressed by her fellow councilors.\nGenerally, Idriane and Rilaunyr coordinated with one another, constantly striving for understanding and consensus-building among the rest of the Impilturan lords, especially when the safety and well-being of the realm was at stake."
