        "mainbody": "'''Aravae Irithyl''' was the lost heiress of the coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] and the first sign of the [[Weeping War|Fall of Myth Drannor]].",
        "History": "Born in [[146 DR]], Aravae was tutored from birth by the [[Srinshee]] and a select group of elder priests of [[Seldarine|elven]] and [[Faer√ªnian pantheon|human]] gods (notably [[Corellon]], [[Sehanine]], [[Eldath]], and [[Mystra]]) to be the heir of [[Irithyl]] and the new coronal. In time, she became a wonderful woman gifted with many skills in magic and diplomacy.\n\nShortly after [[261 DR]], with the Srinshee's support, Aravae secretly went to adventure in the [[Realms]] with a group of friends including [[Josidiah Starym]]. Thanks to a magic [[simulacrum]], everyone believed her she was studying in her house.\n\nShe assisted her great-uncle Eltargrim before his passing. After Eltargrim's death in [[661 DR]], many pressured her to crown herself as the new coronal but, heartbroken, she decided on a five-year-long time of mourning like ancient traditions dictated (in truth, she hoped for the return of Josidiah).\n\nHowever in [[664 DR]], Aravae and her bodyguards were killed by unknown assailants, ending both the line of the house of Irithyl and the time of coronals in [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Relationship": "Aravae loved only one one man in her life, Josidiah Starym, and only the Srinshee knew this. She always hoped to marry him, reforging the bond with the [[Starym]] but Josidiah went to adventure in search of the missing Ary'Velahr'Kerym ([[elfblade]]) and Aravae promised to await his return.\n\nBy the time of her death, Aravae was well loved by many in Myth Drannor. [[Thyaast Ammath]], a prodigy in magical arts of [[House Ammath]], grieved the death of the Coronal Heiress, but she was hopeful for the next ruler and the city's bright future."
