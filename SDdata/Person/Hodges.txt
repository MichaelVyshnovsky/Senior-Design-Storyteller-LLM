Brother '''Hodges''' was an [[Ilmatari]] [[priest]] that lived in [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Personality==
The priest strongly felt for the loss of his wife, but dealt with it the best he could. Hodges was treasured by the community and was known to help out anyone in need. He would even go as far as petitioning the [[Flaming Fist]], [[Parliament of Peers]], and even the dukes of the Gate, to have mercy on those of the [[Outer City]].

==Activities==
This Ilmatari priest was known to talk with others around the Gate, especially poor citizens, whom very much enjoyed the chats. These poor residents visited the priest at his shrine, even when the priest had nothing to give them.

Hodges attempted to bring dignity to the practice of bringing corpses down to a tomb underneath the shrine he kept watch over.

==Relationships==
Brother Hodges had two children ([[Hansen]] and [[Sissa]]), who served as his acolytes. He had a wife, however, she had passed away prior to [[1472 DR]].

==History==
In [[1482 DR]], Hodges maintained the [[Shrine of the Suffering]], a major shrine to [[Ilmater]]. A decade later, a [[carrion crawler]] began to feast on bodies beneath the shrine Hodges maintained. The halfling cleric was unable to pluck up the courage to take on the creature.
