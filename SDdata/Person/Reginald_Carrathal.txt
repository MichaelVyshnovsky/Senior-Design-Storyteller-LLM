'''Reginald Carrathal''' was High King of [[Callidyrr]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}} Like his predecessors, although he held the title of High King of the Moonshae Isles, he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the [[Ffolk]] outside of Callidyrr.

==Relationships==
He was the final ruler of the [[Carrathal Dynasty]]. He was the third son of his father and predecessor, [[Alec Carrathal IV|King Alec IV]]. 

Reginald had a bastard son with an [[Amn]]ian woman. The son's name was [[Brynth Carrathal|Brynth]], and became Reginald's heir.

==History==
He assumed the throne of Callidyrr in the {{YearlinkName|1332}}, after the death of his father. His reign lasted fifteen years.

Beginning in the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, King Reginald became more and more withdrawn. This was the result of a series of carefully placed ''[[Charm person|charms]]'' placed upon the King by his advisor [[Cyndre]], making the King dependant upon Cyndre for everything. The king soon became little more than a puppet in service of [[Bhaal]], and so was deposed by [[Tristan Kendrick]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|30}}
