Reginald Carrathal was High King of Callidyrr in the Moonshae Isles during the early-to-mid 14 century DR. Like his predecessors, although he held the title of High King of the Moonshae Isles, he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the Ffolk outside of Callidyrr.
He was the final ruler of the Carrathal Dynasty. He was the third son of his father and predecessor, King Alec IV. 
Reginald had a bastard son with an Amnian woman. The sons name was Brynth, and became Reginalds heir.
He assumed the throne of Callidyrr in the , after the death of his father. His reign lasted fifteen years.

This was the result of a series of carefully placed charms placed upon the King by his advisor Cyndre, making the King dependant upon Cyndre for everything. The king soon became little more than a puppet in service of Bhaal, and so was deposed by Tristan Kendrick.
