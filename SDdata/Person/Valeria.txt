Investigator '''Valeria''' was a [[hollyphant]] who served the god [[Helm]] in [[Mount Celestia]]. For a very brief time, she worked as a detective for the [[Flaming Fist]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Another case closed, another bottle open! Huzzah to Valeri-AH!|Valeria, drowning her sorrows.}}

==Description==
Like other hollyphants, Valeria appeared as a miniature golden, flying [[elephant]] with four feathered wings that extended out from the rear of her head. She wore a small fabric cap, a single monocle over her right eye and always kept a [[pipe]] jutting out her mouth adjacent her right tusk.

==Personality==
{{Quote|They say that in a world of purest good, who'd have motive to do evil? They also say the path to the Hells is paved in good intentions. So which one is it? Of course ''they'' don't really know. Hypocrites, the lot of them.|Valeria.}}

Valeria had strong opinions about her fellow residents of Celestia. She believed they held no grand understanding on the nature of [[good]] nor [[evil]], and did not believe her fellows immune to the corrupting nature of the latter.

Despite her celestial nature, Valeria was not especially wise nor courageous. She was in fact something of a hapless drunkard. Valeria tended to drown her sorrows in [[ale]] and [[wine]] especially when she was unable to properly solve a case.

==Possessions==
Valeria always made sure to keep a spare pipe handy.

==Activities==
The opinionated hollyphant penned her own personal memoirs about her time in Mount Celestia, entitled ''[[Mastodonian Memoirs]]''.

==Relationships==
She thought her fellow hollyphant [[Lulu]] to be rather naive and foolish.

==History==
[[File:Bothered valeria bg3.png|thumb|''One pissed hollyphant.''|300x300px]]
Valeria became exceptionally concerned when the [[solar]] [[Zariel]] was dispatched to the [[Nine Hells]] to observe the status of the [[Blood Wars]]. She believed that Zariel would not be the only celestial being corrupted by its malign influence.

At some point, Valeria was dispatched to the [[Feywild]] to investigate some unknown matter. She was pulled off assignment for "disorderly drinking" and "spreading conspiracy." 

She was reassigned to the city of Baldur's Gate on the world of Toril, in the [[Calendar of Harptos|Faer√ªnian]] {{YearlinkName|1492}}, to investigate [[the Descent]] of [[Elturel]], as it was pulled down to the plane of [[Avernus]]. Over the course of a [[tenday]], she was assigned by the local Flaming Fist authorities to investigate three cases: the death of Waveservant [[Holli Dylford]], a murderer who took the hands of their victims, and what was referred to by [[Baldur's Mouth]] as the "Ol' Cholms'" case.
