        "mainbody": "aja Nbaza () was a guardian naga living in the city of Orolunga several centuries before the Second Sundering. She was highly knowledgeable about Chult and the events occurring there during her time.\nSaja Nbaza was somehow linked to her temple-residence and could communicate with some individuals who entered within, even hundreds of years after the city was devastated. In the late 15 century DR, she took what actions she could to thwart the machinations of the warlord Ras Nsi and sought to kill him for his past injustices.\nSaja Nbaza was thousands of years old and lived in Orolunga during the events of Ras Nsis downfall and initial uprising. She dwelled within a shrine located in the topmost chamber of one of the citys ziggurats.\nDuring the late 15 century, she met with both Artus Cimber and his companion Dragonbait, along with a company of adventurers as both parties sought the Forbidden City of Omu.\nFollowing the resolution of the Death Curse, Saja Nbaza was slain by Kressvoon, a yuan-ti anathema and leader of a cult of Dendar."
