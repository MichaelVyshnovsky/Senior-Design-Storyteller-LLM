Makbulla bint Dalmar was a dwarf trader who frequented Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Though she posed as a trader, Makbulla was in fact a dangerous pirate who sailed the Golden Gulf in search of prey on her sambuk, The North Winds Fury. Her favorite hunting grounds were near the Pearl Cities and the League of the Pantheon. The waters of the Sea of Caravans were too heavily patrolled for her taste.
Makbulla often resupplied in Huzuz. She also recruited new members to sail with her, preferring dwarves but taking other races if they seemed like a good fit.
Though she was friendly on land, Makbulla was an iron-willed captain while at sea, tolerating no insubordination from her crew. She was honorable though and provided equal shares of the booty.
Makbulla possessed a set of bracers of defense +2, a Cutlass of the Golden Gulf, a dagger and jambiya, two throwing axes, and a potion of heroism.
