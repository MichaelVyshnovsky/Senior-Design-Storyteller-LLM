        "Description": "Omar tied his long hair and beard into braids that spun around during his dances.",
        "Activities": "Omar was a [[Mystic (Zakhara)|dervish]], meaning he could only access his clerical powers after completing a wild dance. He performed these dances in the ''[[Midani dictionary|suqs]]'' of Huzuz in front of a live [[cobra]]. The cobra became hypnotized by Omar's movements, but the clever dwarf sewed the snake's mouth shut just in case. The cobra would eventually starve to death, but a nearly unlimited supply could be found in the wilds surrounding the city."
