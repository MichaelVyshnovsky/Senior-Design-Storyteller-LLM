        "mainbody": "Omar bin Omar was a member of the Dancing Dwarves who lived in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nOmar tied his long hair and beard into braids that spun around during his dances.\nOmar was a dervish, meaning he could only access his clerical powers after completing a wild dance. He performed these dances in the suqs of Huzuz in front of a live cobra. The cobra became hypnotized by Omars movements, but the clever dwarf sewed the snakes mouth shut just in case. The cobra would eventually starve to death, but a nearly unlimited supply could be found in the wilds surrounding the city."
