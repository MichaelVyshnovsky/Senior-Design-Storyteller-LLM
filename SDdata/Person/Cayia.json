        "mainbody": "ayia was the partner of Desharik, the pirate lord of Brynnlaw, in the late 1360s DR.\nThe woman was uncaring and licentious, sleeping with whoever she wished, despite having a partner. Cayia did not seem to care much about her lovers, telling them that she would seek companionship elsewhere unless they did as she bade. Several guards were at her service, and would come to her call, even at late hours of the night.\nShe owned a house to the west of Brynnlaw, southwest of Deshariks house. Cayia was also trusted to keep hold of a special horn when blown, the sound alerted the guards to open the sea gates and allowed boats to pass through.\nCayia was a very promiscuous woman, who boldly slept with others behind her partners back. This was outrageous, considering her partner, King Desharik, was incredibly dangerous, having brutally taken over an island, killing and ruining lives in the process. Desharik wisely remained suspicious towards her, ever since she was caught with the notorious captain, Saemon Havarian. Even when she lay with other men, such as Algor, she took the risk of being discovered.\nIn the past, she had a relationship with Saemon Havarian, and was wooed by his eloquence."
