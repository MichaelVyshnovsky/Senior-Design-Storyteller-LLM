'''Darlakhan''' was a [[Shar]]ran faithful during the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was eager to serve [[Shar]] and was ambitious.

==Description==
He had noticeable ritual scarring on his forearms, and when in ritual, he wore a mantle of shards between his legs, drawing blood with every step.

==Activities==
He had temple tasks in the [[House of Holy Night]].

==History==
Darlakhan was called into the heart of the House of Holy Night by Dread Sister [[Klalaera]] in what he believed was the prelude to his promotion to a position of power. Instead, he was used as a human sacrifice by the clerics who had [[Dasumia]], an avatar of [[Mystra]], bound.
