'''Beromchess Ilthyn''' was a priestess of [[Ilmater]] in the 13th century [[DR]].

==History==
Beromchess lived locally to the elderly sage [[Athorton]] of [[Nleeth]], and became friends with him. It was later theorized that it was Athorton who'd stolen the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''—the holiest book of the faith of [[Ilmater]]—from the priestess of [[Loviatar]], [[Lalaskra]] of [[Ormpetarr]]. This was because, when Athorton died in the [[1264 DR|Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR]], Beromchess came into possession of the ''Tome''. She covertly took the ''Tome'' to the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]], a major temple of Ilmater at the time.
