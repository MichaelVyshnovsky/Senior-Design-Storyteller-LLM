        "Description": "He had a face that betrayed nothing. His voice was soft, close to being lazy.",

        "Relationships": "Marlin Stormserpent believed he merited watching, not full trust.\n\n[[Arclath Delcastle]] knew him to be associated with Marlin Stormserpent, [[Mellast Ormblade]], and [[Irlin Stonestable]], as well as three lords around Arclath's own age, [[Broryn Windstag]], [[Kathkote Dawntard]], and [[Delasko Sornstern]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|364|34}}",
        "History": "To Marlin Stormserpent's knowledge, the fortunes of the Handragon family had fared the worst.\n\nSacrast was involved in the intrigues weaved by [[Marlin Stormserpent]] around his ''[[blueflame item]]s'' in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|265-266|25}}\n\nWhen Marlin tried to release the ghost from the enchanted axe, Sacrast Handragon was amongst the people who were absent when [[Mirt]] came free instead. After Marlin related the events to him, Sacrast confirmed he'd be attending the [[Council of the Dragon]] to represent his family.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|367|35}}\n\nAfter the calamitous Council, Sacrast Handragon turned up at [[Staghaven House]], dropping in on Broryn Windstag, who'd been discussing the outcome with Stonestable and Ormblade. He mentioned that, besides the butchery at [[Castle Obarskyr]], where many older nobles had been cut down, he had seen many of the servants of the [[Stormserpent]] family running in the streets, claiming that Marlin and everyone at [[Stormserpent Towers]] had been slain.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|124-125|13}} While there, they also received the visit of [[Traevyn Illance]], who wanted to recruit them into his own faction should civil war rise, Marlin Stormserpent, who was worried about the mental invasions of the [[vampire]] [[archimage]] [[Manshoon]], and [[Osbur]], a servant of the late [[Olgarth Oldbridle]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|132-135|14}}"
