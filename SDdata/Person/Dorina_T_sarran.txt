'''Dorina T'sarran''' was a [[drow]] [[vampire]] and a priestess of [[Kiaransalee]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was was the daughter of [[Irae T'sarran]].

==Description==
Dorina was gaunt with deep black skin and yellowish-white hair. Her face was beautiful and angular, with something of a feral look about it. She snarled like a wild animal while fighting, revealing her sharp fangs and conveying an expression of being less coldly calculating and strategic than she actually was.

==Possessions==
Dorina typically wore a set of black [[elven chainmail]] and carried a [[heavy mace]], which left her off-hand free to make life-draining attacks.

==History==
She was sent to [[Szith Morcane]] to hunt down the refugees from fallen [[Maerimydra]] after the [[Silence of Lolth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. After taking control of the outpost, Dorina set about organizing raids on the surface lands of [[Daggerdale]].

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], she and some of her [[drider]] minions captured and tried to kill the archmage of Szith Morcane, [[Solom Ned'razak]], during the allied assault on Maerimydra.{{Cite adventurers league/Assault on Maerimydra|29-32}}
