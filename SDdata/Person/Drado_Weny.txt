'''Drado Weny''' was a magic-user in [[Hades]] in [[1358 DR]].
 
==History==
In [[1357 DR]], Drado went into Hades offering his service as an ally to the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]]. However, for his pride, Yrkhetep enslaved him and cursed him to remain in the conduits that permitted access to the [[Infinity Train]] until Drado had killed a thousand enemies of Yrkhetep.
