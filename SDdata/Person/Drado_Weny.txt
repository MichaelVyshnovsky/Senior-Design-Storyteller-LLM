Drado Weny was a magic-user in Hades in 1358 DR.
In 1357 DR, Drado went into Hades offering his service as an ally to the arcanaloth Yrkhetep. However, for his pride, Yrkhetep enslaved him and cursed him to remain in the conduits that permitted access to the Infinity Train until Drado had killed a thousand enemies of Yrkhetep.
