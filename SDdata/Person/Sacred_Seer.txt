The '''Sacred Seer''' was a mutated [[myconid]] ruler in [[Sporedome]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Quest for Sporedome|12-13}}
  
==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the Sacred Seer, infected by madness, decided to worship the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]] together with all her colony, also gaining some [[derro]] and [[fomorian]] followers.{{Cite adventurers league/The Quest for Sporedome|9}}

After the disappearance of many myconid sprouts from all the nearby myconid colonies, [[Agaricus]] and his fellows managed to capture the Sacred Seer and were on the verge of putting her to death.

However, an adventuring party arrived in search of the fabled [[braincap]] mushroom. They offered to save the missing sprouts in exchange for help from the Sacred Seer to find the braincap. After pondering the offer, Agaricus decided to accept the help of the adventurers.

==Personality==
The Sacred Seer was a macabre and brooding creature. Her goal was the decay of all the universe, believing this would benefit her race. The Sacred Seer refused to admit to worshiping Zuggtmoy.
