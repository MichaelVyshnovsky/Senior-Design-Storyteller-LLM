'''Mozah''' was a villager of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Mozah was a villager who tasked an adventurer to get him some money. However, the adventurer did not come back. The Kalach-Cha could investigate into the matter. Upon returning with Mozah with his pay (which was located in [[Highcliff Castle]], held by one of the zombies near the shadow priest), the Kalach-Cha could lie nothing was found and keep the money. Otherwise, the Kalach-Cha could give the money back and get half as a reward.
