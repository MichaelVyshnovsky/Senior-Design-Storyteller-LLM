        "mainbody": "'''Bifu''', whose name translated as \"Big Foot,\" was a [[warrior]] of the reformed cannibal [[Kukalatu]] tribe of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Bifu was a strong and nimble warrior who felt at home atop the jungle trees and swinging across its vines.",
        "Possessions": "Bifu wore a set of [[bone armor]] and was armed with a [[spear]].",
        "History": "In The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle was sent to the Kukalatu tribe by Chief [[Katar (Nubari)|Katar]] of the [[Koshiva]] to establish contact with the reformed cannibal and return with a special healing [[potion]] for the Chief's wife – [[Ootoo]]. A Kukulaturi hunting party was the first contact for the heroes who ran into them not far from the village. Warriors Bifu and [[eJahi]] were the ones to meet the group in the open, while others – [[Gihu]], [[Latu]], and a duo of [[saru]], [[Bubba]] and [[Vimu]], stayed hidden, in case the strangers brought trouble."
