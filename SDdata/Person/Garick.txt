==History==
Sometime around the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], Garick lived as a druid at the circle of Thorngap. Unfortunately, the druid [[Halsaime]] became corrupted by the powers of his [[Halsaime's staff|strange staff]] and became a destructive and malevolent force of nature. Garick was one of the druids that joined his cause, either of his own accord or the powerful will that Halsaime exerted, and guarded [[Thorn Hollow]] with his companion [[dire bear]]s until they were overcome by [[Harper]] agents sent from [[Eveningstar]] by [[Kirinel Zay]].
