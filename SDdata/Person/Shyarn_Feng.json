        "mainbody": "'''Shyarn Feng''' was a [[sohei]] adventurer in [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358]].",
        "History": "Born in [[Wa K'an]] province in Shou Lung, Shyarn Feng grew up at the [[Blue Stork monastery]].\n\nHe quickly became a sohei and his first mission was to recover the temple's [[minyarn]] (an altar containing holy texts and the remains of the monastery's founder). which had been stolen by some bandits. He led a squad of sohei and recovered the minyarn but only after it lost its power and all his companions died, the last placing upon Shyarn a curse: he would never be a leader of men again until he had received the forgiveness and blessing of the gods.\n\nShyarn started traveling to Shou Lung, working for various followers of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] in order to redeem himself but always something went wrong.\n\nIn 1358 DR, he was searching for a divine sign from the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] when he was possibly approached by [[Ko Ho San]].",
        "Personality": "His monk teachers taught him to be very stoic and more reserved and puritan than others. His misfortunes had also made Shyarn very fatalistic.",
        "Relationship": "Shyarn Feng had no close friends, believing that friendship would cause others to have the same misfortune as him. His only companion was his cowardly dog [[Dan]]."
