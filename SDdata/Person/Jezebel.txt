'''Jezebel''' was the [[quasit]] [[familiar]] of [[Sylvira Savikas]], one of the [[Great Reader]]s of [[Candlekeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was rather mischievous and made Sylvira's daily life just a bit more interesting, if a bit more disorderly.

==Relationships==
Jezebel did not get along well with the [[hollyphant]] [[Lulu]], when the celestial creature stayed in Candlekeep for a while.
