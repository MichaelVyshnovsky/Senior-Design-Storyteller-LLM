Sikkat was a rakshasa who ventured across the realm of Anauroch during the late 15 century DR.
Sikkat and their companion Imura traveled across Anauroch, each dishuised as one of the nomadic Bedine people. They would attract travelers with promise of a "magical oasis", lure them into a false sense of security, then attack when the time is right.
