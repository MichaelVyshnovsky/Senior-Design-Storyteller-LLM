'''L'zeth''', mostly known as '''Bitter Breath''', was a [[cornugon]] warlord in [[Avernus]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
L'zeth was obsessed with vengeance and was very ambitious.

==History==
Once L'zeth was a powerful [[pit fiend]] allied with [[Zariel]]. However, to gain more power, he started plotting with [[Bel]] but was discovered by Zariel, who demoted him to a cornugon. After some time, L'zeth became involved in a new plot to depose Zariel and was again caught. This time, the [[archdevil]] broke L'zeth's wings and [[curse]]d him so he could no longer enter into deals or sign contacts, and his voice became only smoke. Thus L'zeth became Bitter Breath. Moreover, Zariel prohibited any [[devil]] from associating with him. Despite this, L'zeth did not lose his ambitions and instead formed a gang of [[hobgoblin]]s and became a warlord by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}{{BG-DiA-time}}.
