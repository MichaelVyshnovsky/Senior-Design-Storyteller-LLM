        "mainbody": "'''Old Oghi''' was a massive and powerful [[bear]] that resided within the [[Dragonbone Vale]] of the [[Sword Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "For some unknown reason, animals born in the Dragonbone Vale were fiercer and bigger than their kin. Old Oghi was a prime example of that.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Old Oghi was well known to the [[ranger]]s that frequented the mountain valley. One story told of a young [[blue dragon]] killing a [[deer]] and Oghi fearlessly charging at the wyrm and scaring it off with a terrifying, earth-shattering roar, claiming the meat.\n\nWhen the [[Cult of the Dragon]] claimed the Dragonbone Vale, Old Oghi became a target of a hunt with [[adventurer]]s being offered a hefty reward for the successful hunt. It is unknown if Old Oghi was felled by the adventurers' [[sword]]s."
