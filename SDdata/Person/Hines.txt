'''Hines''' was the lieutenant of the [[Shadow Thieves]] enclave during their brief return to [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ten years after the events of the [[Time of Troubles]], in [[1370 DR]], the Shadow Thieves reestablished their presence in Waterdeep via a hidden stronghold somewhere in the upper levels of [[Undermountain]]. The guild flourished in complete secrecy undetected by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] for many months under the leadership of Guild Master [[Georges]]. This lasted until the man found love in [[Meryth Phaulkon]] and was getting ready to betray the Shadow Thieves to the Lords for his newfound happiness. But Hines saw this coming, being a close advisor and the trusted lieutenant. He secretly went to the Grand Master [[Xabash]], allegedly even meeting with the mysterious figure. To stop the destruction and punish the lovestruck man, Hines kidnapped Meryth Phaulkon, dragging her to the deeper levels of Undermountain on the commands of the Grand Master. Hines hoped that he was to inherit Georges' title when the punishment was complete. But the Guild Master was confronted by the hero sent into the dungeon by [[Khelben Arunsun]]. The hero decimated the guild and spared George's life in exchange for the documents, the intel that the guild had assembled for their drow allies. Georges begged the hero to rescue his lover from the cunning lieutenant.
