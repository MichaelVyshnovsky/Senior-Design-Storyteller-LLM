Keane was a wizard in the Moonshae Isles.
Keane was the royal tutor of the two young princesses Alicia Kendrick and Deirdre Kendrick, posing as a failed wizard as ordered by King Tristan Kendrick. He followed Alicia in all her adventures, helping battle her many foes, destroying a dracolich, fighting the Ityak-Ortheel and traveling to Evermeet. At last, he confessed his feelings to Alicia, which seemed to be reciprocated.
Keane was a quiet, observant, and studious individual. Under that facade, however, he was a powerful wizard, always ready to personally fight evil. He fell in love with Alicia and married her in 1366 DR.
