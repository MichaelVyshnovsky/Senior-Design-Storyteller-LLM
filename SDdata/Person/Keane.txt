'''Keane''' was a wizard in the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==History==
Keane was the royal tutor of the two young princesses [[Alicia Kendrick]] and [[Deirdre Kendrick]], posing as a failed wizard as ordered by King [[Tristan Kendrick]]. He followed Alicia in all her adventures, helping battle her many foes, destroying a [[dracolich]], fighting the [[Ityak-Ortheel]] and traveling to [[Evermeet]]. At last, he confessed his feelings to Alicia, which seemed to be reciprocated.

==Personality==
Keane was a quiet, observant, and studious individual. Under that facade, however, he was a powerful wizard, always ready to personally fight evil. He fell in love with Alicia and married her in [[1366 DR]].
