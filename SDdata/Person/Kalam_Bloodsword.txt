'''Kalam Bloodsword''' was a veteran [[Zhentilar]] warrior in [[High Dale]].

==History==
In [[1358 DR]], Kalam was one of the Zhentilar lieutenants in the secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. When an insurrection started thanks to [[Elminster Aumar]] the [[Rangers Three]]'s actions, Kalam led a company of lancemen and tried to order the rioters to go home. However, the Dalesfolk lead by [[Irreph Mulmar]] attacked the Zhents and [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]] killed Kalam.
