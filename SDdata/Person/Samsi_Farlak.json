        "mainbody": "Samsi Farlak was a dwarven inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nSamsi hated the sea, but he did enjoy telling stories relating to it.\nSamsi was the owner of the Home of the Happy Dolphin, an inn located within the Trade Harbor district of Huzuz.\nIn order to make a profit, Samsi often watered-down wine and spirits served at the inn.\nIf the opportunity presented itself, Samsi would not balk at selling someone, preferably an outland barbarian, into slavery."
