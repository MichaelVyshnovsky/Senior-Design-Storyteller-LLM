His mother was named Ilmara, and he had a younger brother named Imbrar.\nKing Imphras V was next in line to be king when his uncle was murdered just before his coronation. Since Imphras was only four years old at the time, Queen-Regent Sambryl continued to reign in his stead.\nIn 1363 DR, however, Imphras died of a wasting disease before he had even come of age. His younger brother, Imbrar became the next king."
