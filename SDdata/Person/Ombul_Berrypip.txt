Ombul Berrypip was a halfling cook in the Earthspur Mountains.
In 1491 DR, Ombul lived with his daughter, Lupe Berrypip. He was sent to the mine in the Earthspurs as a cook. When a medusa and her gargoyle minions took control of the mine, Ombul was captured along with many miners, until an adventuring party hired to clear the mine found and rescued them.
