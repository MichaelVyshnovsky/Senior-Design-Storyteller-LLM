'''Kamoth Kastelmar''' was a member of a minor noble family of [[Hillsfar]].  

==Possessions==
The ''[[Kraken Queen]]'' was equipped with a magical device created by [[Red Wizards]] known as a starry compass that allowed it to sail high into the air, even as high as [[Selûne]]. 

==Activities==
The [[Black Moon]]s created a base on one of [[Tears of Selûne]] out of which they operated.

==History==
Kastelmar married into the ruling Hulmaster family of [[Hulburg]] through his marriage to [[Terena Hulmaster]]. In [[1466 DR]], Kamoth attempted to seize power but was thwarted and forced into exile.

After his exile, Kamoth engaged in piracy on the [[Moonsea]] and eventually took command of the Black Moon pirate company, where he commanded the pirate vessel ''Kraken Queen''. 

In [[1479 DR]] Kamoth lead the Black Moons in an attack on Hulburg.
