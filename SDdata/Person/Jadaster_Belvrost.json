        "mainbody": "Jadaster Belvrost was a member of the Belvrost clan of mages as of the late 14 century DR.\nBy , he was an investor in Telpir. As a hobby, he improved locks and locking spells to better withstand attacks.\nBy the same year, Jadaster was growing increasingly restless under the desire for an exotic wife.\nIt was possible that Jadasters sudden fetish for exotic mages was an inborn curse by Maxiladanarr Torstren, as Belvrost mages of either gender had long been known to desire wedding magically skilled folks from far places. Even where marriage failed to endure or materialize, the children produced joined the clan."
