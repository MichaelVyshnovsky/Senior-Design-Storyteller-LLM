'''Laraby''' was a [[Purple Dragons|Purple Dragon]] who served under [[Aleka Ravenheart]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Laraby had freckles and curly red hair .

==Personality==
He was an enthusiastic young man, who sympathized with adventurers and their way of life. Despite this, he was perfectly loyal to the Crown and couldn't possibly be tempted to help them break the law.

==Possessions==
Laraby wore [[chainmail]] armor, and carried a [[longsword]] and [[shortbow]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], Laraby was under the command of Aleka Ravenheart at Thistleflame Keep's garrison. He assisted a group of deputized adventurers in investigating the apparent murder of Lord [[Partic Thistle]], which largely consisted of keeping an eye on them and escorting them around the premises.
