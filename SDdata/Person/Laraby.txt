He was an enthusiastic young man, who sympathized with adventurers and their way of life. Despite this, he was perfectly loyal to the Crown and couldnt possibly be tempted to help them break the law.

In 1369 DR, Laraby was under the command of Aleka Ravenheart at Thistleflame Keeps garrison. He assisted a group of deputized adventurers in investigating the apparent murder of Lord Partic Thistle, which largely consisted of keeping an eye on them and escorting them around the premises.
