'''Nuressa''' was a warrior and adventurer in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She towered over her teammates and had bronzed, muscled limbs. Her armor was blackened somewhat, and included gauntlets. There was at least one scar on her body, around one hip.

==Personality==
She did not care for people to know she had been enslaved.

==Possessions==
She wielded a very large sword, and wore blackened armor. Later, she acquired a castle together with her adventuring companions.

==Relationships==
She adventured together with [[Folossan]], [[Amandarn]], and [[Iyriklaunavan]].

==History==
Before being an adventurer, Nuressa had been en[[slave]]d.

In a warm day of [[Mirtul]] in the {{yearlinkName|759}}, the group Nuressa was with ran into a [[Netherese]] tomb. In the main room, they spotted a [[Elminster|body]] floating up near the ceiling, and four pillars in a large room. As Iyriklaunavan cast a spell to bring down the corpse, the pillars sprouted hundreds of eyes and attacked them.

After managing to get away from the pillars of eyes, which the corpse attacked and destroyed after animating, the body approached the adventurers and asked what year it was. Nuressa replied with the date, to which the corpse immediately ''teleported'' away. The team decided to flee the tomb and leave it unexplored.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|517-518|Prologue}}

Later, it turned out that Amandarn had gambled all their money away shortly afterward; Folossan nearly killed him for it. The two stole back some of their coin, got caught, and fled. After spending the evening under an altar to [[Mystra]], they found a small fortune and a deed to a castle by morning, which they presented to the rest of the team. Iyriklaunavan magically verified their account, while Nuressa did not find out until {{yearlinkName|767}}; all four, however, became Lords of the Castle.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|731-736|19}}

During the chaos of [[the Art]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Nuressa donned her armor for the first time in years upon hearing an explosion coming from the study of Iyriklaunavan and his student, [[Rauntlavon]], almost causing damage to the castle room in which they worked. As Nuressa arrived, he revealed that they'd been able to farscry that [[Azuth]] had just been magically attacked in the presence of a [[Chosen of Mystra]], and that said Chosen was the body that had escaped back when they were in the Netherese tomb. Iyriklaunavan saw fit to reveal to her they'd been blessed by Mystra, and the process of their acquisition of the castle. More importantly, Folossan noted that the chaos of the Art, if it worsened, would lead to the destruction of their castle, as it had been buttressed with magic itself.
