        "Relationships": "Vendemniharan was the son of the two green dragons both called Venom: [[Venominhandar]] and [[Venomindhar]].",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, Overmistress [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] was searching for allies against the [[Shadovar]] who supported her enemies in the [[Sembian Civil War]], and so negotiated a deal with the Cult to have the strength of Vendemniharan in the planned attack against [[Selgaunt]].\n\nOn [[Uktar 30]], during the [[Battle of Selgaunt]] after some [[earth elemental]]s and [[fire elemental]]s had weakened the defenders of the city, Vendem attacked. [[Shadovar]] Prince [[Rivalen Tanthul]] faced him but was injured by the dragon's [[acid]] breath. A spell-duel started between Rivalen and Vendem, but in the end the Prince of Shade heavily injured the green dragon, who fled the battlefield."
