        "mainbody": "elek was a deep gnome of Blingdenstone and a ghost in Gracklstugh in the late 15 century DR.\nPelek lived in Blingdenstone until he met Buppido. He fell in with him and followed him to Gracklstugh. There, however, he discovered that Buppido was a mad killer, and Buppido killed Pelek. Some time after, probably because of the energies unleashed by the demon lords circa 1486 DR, he rose again as a ghost in Buppidos lair. He could only be given peace if someone took his remains back to his hometown and buried them there."
