        "mainbody": "Aulagol was an illithilich wizard and a member of the Concord of Elders that governed the illithid city of ChChitl in the Northdark of the Underdark in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nDuring a visit to the Astral Plane, Aulagol allowed a raiding party of githyanki to discover his astral projection and to pursue him to the astral portion of the citys elder brain. \nTaking desperate measures, the ulitharid Thalynsar transformed himself and several other illithids, including Aulagol, into liches so they could devour the elder brain, preserve its knowledge and powers, and take its place. Successful in their endeavor, the illithiliches formed a Conclave of Elders, with Thalynsar as the most powerful among them. He tried to retain much of the elder brains knowledge for himself, but the excessive information steadily turned him insane, a trait that Aulagol noted. \nNevertheless, Thalynsar ruled ChChitl for over a hundred years. Finally, around 1370 DR, Aulagol and the other Elders united and were obligated to kill the insane Thalynsar. However, they struggled to lead in his place and divide the elder brains lore."
