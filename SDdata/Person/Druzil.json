        "mainbody": "Druzil was an imp from the Lower Planes.\nDruzil was two feet tall, had a canine face with floppy ears, his mouth was equipped with a set of pointed, yellow teeth, and he often moved his forked tongue in a lizard-like fashion. He had bat-like wings and a sharp barbed tail dripping with poison. The imp had taloned claws for fingers and skinny legs.\nApart from being able to sting and poison an individual with his tail, Druzil also had the innate ability to become invisible at will, though any offensive action by himself would reveal him again. He could also change himself into a different creatureâ€”once he became a centipede in order to escape an attack by Cadderly Bonaduce.\nThe imp could use a drop of his blood to enact a curse, thus dispelling or at least weakening goodly magic.\nDruzil could release little bolts of energy, much like small, green bolts of lightning.\nDruzil was summoned several times to Torils plane.\nHe was the acquaintance of Aballister Bonaduce and introduced the magician to the recipe of the Chaos Curse. Druzil stayed with Aballister to see the Curse perform its hideous work on the clerics of the Edificant Library. The imp was a short-time associate of the cleric Barjin when he brought the Chaos Curse to the Edificant Library.\nThe magician Dorigen also had the doubtful honor of being associated with Druzil while supervising the assault of Ragnors troops on the elves of Shilmista Forest.\nIt was he who manipulated Kierkan Rufo in a manner that led to him becoming a vampire.\nHe was also used by Cadderly to retrieve information about the balor Errtu (whom he later served) for Drizzt DoUrden."
