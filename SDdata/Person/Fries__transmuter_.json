        "Activities": "Fries was a master of the [[transmutation]] of elemental [[Earth (element)|earth]], meaning the conversion of stone and metal and similar substances from one form to another, and taught the subject at the Seminary under [[Quintus]]. Her last major project before the fall of Netheril was the conversion of [[gold]] to [[platinum]], a process that turned much gold into little platinum, but one that she was steadily improving until her death."
