'''Ulsinar''' was a carpenter in [[Highmoon]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During one evening after [[Mirtul]] of {{yearlink|1357}}, while [[Shandril Shessair]] was away, Ulsinar patronized the [[Highmoon Inn]] and witnessed a brief argument between [[Yantra]] and other patrons, on which he whooped and cheered.
