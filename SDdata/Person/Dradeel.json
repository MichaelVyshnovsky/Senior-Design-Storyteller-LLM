He became trapped in his house, besieged by [[werewolves]]. Eventually, in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Gorion's Ward]] and party found him and helped him recover his [[spellbook]].\n\nThe experience left Dradeel suffering from severe paranoia and delusions, a dangerous combination with his remaining magical powers. As a result, he was institutionalized in [[Spellhold]]. When the mage named [[Jon Irenicus]] took over Spellhold, Dradeel was relentlessly questioned and subjected to brutal magical experiments. Despite his condition, Dradeel experienced bouts of sanity wherein he would relieve his happiest moments; learning how to cook family recipes as a child. He would use these moments to write down the recipes, and if spoken to by Gorion's Ward, would happily share copies. His family's recipes included [[Monkey Balls (food)|Monkey Balls]], [[Amnian Dragoon Soup]], [[Baldur's Delight]], and [[Ruby Racks]]. He was evidently killed later in 1369 DR while aiding Gorion's Ward in a battle against Jon Irenicus."
