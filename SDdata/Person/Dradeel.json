        "mainbody": "Dradeel was an elven wizard and the only surviving member of the explorer Baldurans last crew.\nDuring his time on Baldurans Isle, Dradeel wore a robe of the neutral archmagi and a wolfsbane charm.\nDradeel was on board Baldurans ship when it arrived at Baldurans Isle in the Trackless Sea. However, they were hunted by the many lycanthropes that lived on the isle. He became trapped in his house, besieged by werewolves. Eventually, in the , Gorions Ward and party found him and helped him recover his spellbook.\nThe experience left Dradeel suffering from severe paranoia and delusions, a dangerous combination with his remaining magical powers. As a result, he was institutionalized in Spellhold. When the mage named Jon Irenicus took over Spellhold, Dradeel was relentlessly questioned and subjected to brutal magical experiments. Despite his condition, Dradeel experienced bouts of sanity wherein he would relieve his happiest moments learning how to cook family recipes as a child. He would use these moments to write down the recipes, and if spoken to by Gorions Ward, would happily share copies. His familys recipes included Monkey Balls, Amnian Dragoon Soup, Baldurs Delight, and Ruby Racks. He was evidently killed later in 1369 DR while aiding Gorions Ward in a battle against Jon Irenicus."
