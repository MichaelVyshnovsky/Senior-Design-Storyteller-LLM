Sardrin Olaundran was a member of the Olaundran merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.
Sardrin was an over-indulgent young man but quite active and robust. As a general rule, he wore fine clothing made from a true gold-colored (never yellow) cloth called shimmerweave, but also wore the latest fashions when they suited him.
Sardrin and his brother Elvolaer were very much alike, which occasionally led to competition and even heated disagreements, but more often they were a team, either causing trouble, getting into trouble, or both. Like the whole Olaundran clan, they never bargained over the price of goods and services, always paying full price. As a point of pride, they only paid attention to money when gambling.
Sardrins hobbies included hawking and hunting, gambling, and wagering on fights between beasts or slaves (usually mudwrestling).
Sardrin was the third child and second eldest son of Yolaun Olaundran, one of the de facto leaders of the family business. He was the grandson of the patriarch of the clan, "Old" Gauthklaun. After him, there were three younger siblings.
