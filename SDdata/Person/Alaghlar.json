Hidden from creatures pillaging the ruins of the Speculum Grounds, the safehold was stocked with food, spellbooks, and emergency supplies. The hidden extradimensional room was rumored to be guarded powerful wards and guardians, one such guardian being a deepspawn. The only way of accessing the safehold was via inserting the correct key into a hole at the center of Speculums floor."
