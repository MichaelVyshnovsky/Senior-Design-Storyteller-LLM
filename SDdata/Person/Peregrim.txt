Sir Peregrim was a death knight enslaved by Orbakh in Westgate around 1374 DR. 
Sir Peregrim was a Tyrran and paladin who, together with his lover Elandra, fought the Night Masks. However, during the battle, he feared for his life and fled. Peregrim was then captured by Orbakh and killed. Before Elandra was cut down, she cursed Night Masks and him alike. Upon his own passing, he became a death knight condemned to guard Elandra for eternity. And, he was tasked with the mission to guard the Night Masks secret Human Cattle Factory. Their story was sung by one bard staying in Bent Mermaid Inn.
Around 1374 DR, an adventurer in a fight with the Night Masks destroyed Peregrim.
