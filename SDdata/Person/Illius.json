        "mainbody": "Illius was a sorcerer during the 14th century DR.\nHe used a staff and a formidable array of magical powers, as well as a set of force beads he used in combat.\nIllius was born into a line of knights, but when he discovered that he had sorcerous powers he pursued that path instead. His father disapproved of this and disowned Illius, though it was later discovered that Ygorl had mentally influenced Illius father from inside the Demon Stone.\nAt some point, Illius trained under Khelben Arunsun. Later, he adventured with Rhannek and Zhai, and would come into possession of a demon stone."
