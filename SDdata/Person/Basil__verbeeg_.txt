Basil of Lyndusfarne was an unusual verbeeg in the service of the Kingdom of Hartsvale in the 1370s DR. He was a runecaster, a rarity among his people.
Basil was more than eight feet tall, with gangly arms, stooped shoulders, and thick bowed legs. He had a large belly. His eyebrows and scrawny beard were coarse and gray.
Basil met and befriended Tavis Burdun, just moments before the princess Brianna was kidnapped. He and the orphan Avner accompanied Tavis in the rescue mission. In time, he became a good friend of both Tavis and Brianna. Unfortunately during the final battle against the Twilight Spirit, Basils body was permanently deformed.
