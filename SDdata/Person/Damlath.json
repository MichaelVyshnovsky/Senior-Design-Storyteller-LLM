        "mainbody": "amlath (nicknamed the Laughing Mage) was a wizard.\nDamlath was dark-skinned.\nDamlath had an acerbic personality to which few warmed. He would usually only prepare very few combat spells, preferring spells that were investigative or concealing.\nDamlath acquired a flying carpet from Llorbauth and used it as a mount, in preference to a horse. He wore a cloak with magical pockets that could store extra equipment, such as his carpet.\nDamlath was originally from Erlkazar, and became a devotee of Oghma in Llorbauth at the Lore Halls. In 1350 DR, he went to Silverymoon to work with Sandrew the Wise, and when Sandrew began work on the Font of Knowledge in Waterdeep, Damlath helped in the construction.\nIn 1371 DR, Damlath began working with Raegar Stoneblade, under Phanar Manthar at the Font of Knowledge in Waterdeep, with the aim of disclosing secrets held by wizards in the city. Together their surveillance and dispatching of Surkhas of Leilon was able to prevent the Arcane Brotherhood from claiming the High House of Thalivar and its secrets.\nDamlath visited Erlkazar in Mirtul, 1374 DR.\nDamlath was killed by the lich Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk, who used Damlaths body as a disguise."
