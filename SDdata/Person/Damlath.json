In 1350 DR, he went to [[Silverymoon]] to work with [[Sandrew|Sandrew the Wise]], and when Sandrew began work on the [[Font of Knowledge]] in [[Waterdeep]], Damlath helped in the construction.\n\nIn 1371 DR, Damlath began working with [[Raegar Stoneblade]], under [[Phanar Manthar]] at the Font of Knowledge in Waterdeep, with the aim of disclosing secrets held by wizards in the city. Together their surveillance and dispatching of [[Surkhas]] of [[Leilon]] was able to prevent the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] from claiming the High House of [[Thalivar]] and its secrets.\n\nDamlath visited Erlkazar in Mirtul, 1374 DR.\n\nDamlath was killed by the lich [[Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk]], who used Damlath's body as a disguise."
