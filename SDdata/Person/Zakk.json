Farmer Zakk and his husband fled to the nearby city of Baldurs Gate with a few of their surviving cows. Sadly, if the spouses were to be given access to the city within the walls, the cows would be confiscated by the Flaming Fist mercenaries upon entry to be slaughtered due to ration shortage in the city. Zakk was granted entrance to the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, while his husband the cattle stayed in Rivington. Zakk lamented the prospect of loosing their cows â€“ their only livelihood and joined the protesting farmers by the Basilisk Gate."
