        "mainbody": "yraene was a half-elf bravo of Yhaunn in Sembia in the late 14 century DR.\nLyraene was a young and restless bastard from a well-to-do family. She had golden blonde hair and dressed fashionably as she sought out excitement by carousing with her friends in the Stiltways and provoking fights with other young duelists. She especially delighted in performatively insulting and taunting her enemies.\nShe was born from a liaison her human mother had with an elf while already married, and had a half-brother who worked as a city guard. \nShe habitually caroused with a small gang of friends, both for company and protection. Keph Thingoleir was a favorite rival of hers, who she enjoyed clashing with verbally and physically.\nLyraene was a skilled and daring rapier duelist, and had inherited some magical ability from her elven father, allowing her to cast minor arcane spells. She had the ability to cast a weak light cantrip, and a kind of magic missile.\nIn early Eleasis of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, she provoked Keph into a fight at the Skys Mantle tavern. After much grandstanding from both of them, she easily disarmed and humiliated him before he managed to escape.\nKeph took his revenge a few nights later after being initiated into the cult of Shar, luring her into a more favorable duel. He inviting her to fight on a narrow footbridge in the Stiltways, and overwhelmed her with aggressive swordplay and reckless sabotage of the bridge. Driven by bitterness and spite, Keph then began torturing her with his lightning-charged rapier, Quick, maiming her right arm with the intent of preventing her from ever casting spells again, and making her loss a sacrifice to Shar. Before he could inflict more harm upon her, he was driven away by the Sel√ªnite priest Mifano, who attended to healing Lyraenes arm. \nShortly after the fight, she was approached by the Sharran priestess Variance Amatick, who modified her memory of the events. Lyraenes perception of the duel was altered to remove Kephs malice and deliberate sadism, instead giving the impression of an honest duel that turned unexpectedly bloody. Thanks to Variances influence, Lyraene chose to keep the injury a personal matter, rather than having Keph arrested for his assault."
