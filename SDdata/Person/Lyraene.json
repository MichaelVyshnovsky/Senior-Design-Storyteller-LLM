        "mainbody": "'''Lyraene''' was a [[half-elf]] bravo of [[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lyraene was a young and restless bastard from a well-to-do family. She had golden blonde hair and dressed fashionably as she sought out excitement by carousing with her friends in the [[Stiltways]] and provoking fights with other young duelists. She especially delighted in performatively insulting and taunting her enemies.",
        "Relationships": "She was born from a liaison her [[human]] mother had with an [[elf]] while already married, and had a half-brother who worked as a city guard. \n\nShe habitually caroused with a small gang of friends, both for company and protection. [[Keph Thingoleir]] was a favorite rival of hers, who she enjoyed clashing with verbally and physically.",
        "Abilities": "Lyraene was a skilled and daring rapier duelist, and had inherited some magical ability from her elven father, allowing her to cast minor [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spells. She had the ability to cast a weak ''[[light]]'' [[cantrip]], and a kind of ''[[magic missile]]''.",
        "History": "In early [[Eleasis]] of the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], she provoked Keph into a fight at the [[Sky's Mantle]] tavern. After much grandstanding from both of them, she easily disarmed and humiliated him before he managed to escape.\n\nKeph took his revenge a few nights later after being initiated into the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|cult of Shar]], luring her into a more favorable duel. He inviting her to fight on a narrow footbridge in the [[Stiltways]], and overwhelmed her with aggressive swordplay and reckless sabotage of the bridge. Driven by bitterness and spite, Keph then began torturing her with his lightning-charged rapier, ''[[Quick]]'', maiming her right arm with the intent of preventing her from ever casting spells again, and making her loss a sacrifice to [[Shar]]. Before he could inflict more harm upon her, he was driven away by the [[Selûne|Selûnite]] priest [[Mifano]], who attended to healing Lyraene's arm. \n\nShortly after the fight, she was approached by the [[Shar|Sharran]] [[priestess]] [[Variance Amatick]], who modified her memory of the events. Lyraene's perception of the duel was altered to remove Keph's malice and deliberate sadism, instead giving the impression of an honest duel that turned unexpectedly bloody. Thanks to Variance's influence, Lyraene chose to keep the injury a personal matter, rather than having Keph arrested for his assault."
