'''Thegglis Tefoco''' was a caravan guard and one of the older children of [[Oliver Tefoco]], the proprietor of the [[Beehive Goods and Wares]] general store in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Anyway, we're fine, and we've learned so much from the older caravan guards. I can dual wield now with a dagger in my off hand! So. got to go, don't work too hard, and keep the Bee Hive buzzing, ha ha!''|Thegglis Tefoco}}

==Relationships==
Thegglis was a child of Oliver and [[Kroyce Tefoco]], and had a number of siblings. The oldest of them was [[Bubbles Tefoco]], who lived in the [[Stonyeyes]] district of the Gate with her family and the newborn [[Dorimara]]. another older sibling was [[Dariel Tefoco]] who served the [[Flaming Fist]]. Thegglis' brother [[Crowell Tefoco|Crowell]] was a fellow caravan guard, and the youngest siblings [[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]], [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]], and others, still lived with Oliver and Kroyce as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] threatened Baldur's Gate's safety, Thegglis and Crowell were stuck with their [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] caravan at [[Boareskyr Bridge]]. The caravan's return to the gate was postponed due to the cult's threat and the city gates being closed. During their travels, the older caravan guards taught Thegglis to dual-wield a [[dagger]] with a [[sword]], according to the letter home Thegglis penned for Crowell, who could not yet write.
