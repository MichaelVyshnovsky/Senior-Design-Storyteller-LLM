Ghondarrath was a veteran in Highmoon as of the mid-14 century DR.
He was stern-eyed, with a hard jaw and a beard going gray-white. 
He was quite adept at killing.
He was a regular at the Rising Moon.
In Mirtul 6 of , Ghondarrath told of the treasures of Myth Drannor at the Rising Moon on the evening when the Company of the Bright Spear was celebrating their recent spoils there. While at that inn, he caught the thief, Lynxal, pickpocketing him when Lynxal drew a dagger, Ghondarrath struck his head against the table, slaying him. A deadly brawl nearly began, with the Company of the Bright Spear, but the timely intervention of Storm Silverhand and Sharantyr gave the adventurers pause enough to reconsider.
