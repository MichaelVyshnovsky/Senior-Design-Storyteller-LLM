Muri bint Fatima was an inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Muri was responsible for collecting taxes from caravans and merchants passing through the Gate of Wealth.
New to her post, Muri recognized Farims corrupt ways. Since the mamluks under Farims command remained loyal to him, there was not much that she could do about it.
