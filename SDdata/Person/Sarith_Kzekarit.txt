'''Sarith Kzekarit''' was a [[drow]] warrior who was infected by demonic madness during the late 1480s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Sarith had a fatalistic approach to problems. He feared he was going mad, but the truth was more sinister: he was under the influence of the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]].

==History==
Sarith was a drow of [[Menzoberranzan]] living in the [[Velkynvelve]] outpost.

During the late 1480s DR, he captured the [[myconid]] [[Stool]], but had been infected with myconid spores corrupted by Zuggtmoy. Under a spore-induced-madness, Sarith killed a fellow drow warrior and was put among the slaves, waiting for the right time to be transported back to the city and to be sacrificed to [[Lolth]].
