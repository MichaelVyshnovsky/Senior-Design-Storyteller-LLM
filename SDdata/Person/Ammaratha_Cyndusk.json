        "History": {
            "Early life": "Ammaratha's early life was not known; what was known about her came mainly by way of Elminster and their daughter Narnra.{{Speculation}}\n\nAround [[1300 DR]], Ammaratha adventured in the form of a [[human]] [[sorceress]], using the pseudonym '''Maerjanthra Shalace'''. She eventually settled in Waterdeep, where she became a jeweler for the nobility, and became known as '''Lady Maerjanthra of the Gems'''.\n\nDuring this time, she became one of Elminster's many occasional lovers. Eventually, she decided to bear him a child, which presented a problem: as a [[Chosen of Mystra]], Elminster had conscious control over his own fertility. She decided to go to her lover's fellow Chosen, [[Khelben Arunsun]], to get a spell to let her conceive. Arunsun at first refused, but then the goddess [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] herself intervened, commanding the Blackstaff to grant the request.",
            "Life in Cormyr": "After fleeing Waterdeep, she settled in the city of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]], where she took the name '''Lady Joysil Ambrur''', presenting herself as a wealthy [[Sembia]]n merchant noble.\n\nShe was last seen with former Mage Royal [[Vangerdahast]] in [[1373 DR]], who forced her into stasis in draconic form alongside him. This was part of a plan by Vangerdahast to bind [[metallic dragon]]s in an extradimensional space, replacing the fallen [[Lords Who Sleep]] as the hidden guardians of Cormyr.",
            "15th century": "She remained in stasis with Vangey, later joined also by [[Myrmeen Lhal]], until a large army of [[shadovar]] [[arcanist]]s led by a [[Princes of Shade|prince of shade]] attacked their resting place in [[1487 DR]]. During the battle, the shadovar were defeated thanks to the [[ghost]] of [[Alusair Obarskyr]], but Ammaratha died in the fighting."

        "Home": "In Marsember, as Joysil Ambrur, she dwelled at the [[Haelithtorntowers]] mansion."
