She eventually settled in Waterdeep, where she became a jeweler for the nobility, and became known as Lady Maerjanthra of the Gems.\nDuring this time, she became one of Elminsters many occasional lovers. Eventually, she decided to bear him a child, which presented a problem as a Chosen of Mystra, Elminster had conscious control over his own fertility. She decided to go to her lovers fellow Chosen, Khelben Arunsun, to get a spell to let her conceive. Arunsun at first refused, but then the goddess Mystra herself intervened, commanding the Blackstaff to grant the request.\nAfter fleeing Waterdeep, she settled in the city of Marsember in Cormyr, where she took the name Lady Joysil Ambrur, presenting herself as a wealthy Sembian merchant noble.\nShe was last seen with former Mage Royal Vangerdahast in 1373 DR, who forced her into stasis in draconic form alongside him. This was part of a plan by Vangerdahast to bind metallic dragons in an extradimensional space, replacing the fallen Lords Who Sleep as the hidden guardians of Cormyr.\nShe remained in stasis with Vangey, later joined also by Myrmeen Lhal, until a large army of shadovar arcanists led by a prince of shade attacked their resting place in 1487 DR. During the battle, the shadovar were defeated thanks to the ghost of Alusair Obarskyr, but Ammaratha died in the fighting.\nIn Marsember, as Joysil Ambrur, she dwelled at the Haelithtorntowers mansion."
