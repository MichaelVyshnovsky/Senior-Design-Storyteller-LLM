'''Hamastarin''' was a member of the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]] in [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Hamastarin earned his vast fortune as a successful merchant in [[Sembia]], and used that fortune to buy his way onto the council in Zhentil Keep which was called [[Flostren's Hold]] during that time. He used his considerable influence to back the deceased [[Elephstron]]'s son, [[Jhoaz]], for an open seat on the Council because he believed he could control his decisions.
