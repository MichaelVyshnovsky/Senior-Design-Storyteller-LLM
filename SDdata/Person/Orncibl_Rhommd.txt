Orncibl Rhommd was a weaver from the town of Hilp in Cormyr in the late 14 century DR.
In the late 14 century DR, a simple wearer discovered what he called the Crypt of Dragons, not far from town. Orncibl claimed that the vast cavern – the Crypt of Dragons, was filled with piles of gold and gems. Corpses of various mummified dragons were carefully arranged atop the treasure piles. They were surrounded by fields of magical protection – crackling blue magic that immediately killed anyone who was stupid enough to approach the hordes. Two of Orncibls apprentices suffered that grim fate. The weaver himself disappeared soon after he revealed the caves existence at a tavern in Hilp. He was believed to had been taken by the dreaded Cult of the Dragon or to be hiding from the sinister organization.
