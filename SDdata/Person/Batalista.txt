Batalista was a grand mage and the creator of the enchanted ring known as Batalistas Passport.
Not much was known about Batalista despite his title and arcane prowess. His main achievement was the creation of Batalistas Passport, a powerful version of a ring of fire resistance he planned to use in his travels across the Elemental Plane of Fire. In creating the ring, Batalista summoned a salamander on numerous occasions to tap into its knowledge of fire magic. Eventually, the elemental creature lost all patience with the wizard and managed to incinerate Batalistas tower with him inside. After the flames died off, Batalistas Passport was found on a ripped-off finger, untouched by the flames. The rings creation was completed and Batalista wouldve likely survived the inferno if his ring finger was still attached to his hand.
