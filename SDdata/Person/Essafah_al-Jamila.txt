Essafah al-Jamila was a shair and shopkeeper who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Essahahs shop, called Items for the Immortals, catered to genies and other shairs.
Essafah specialized in the creation of genie prisons, usually in the form of a lamp or bottle, though he claimed he could fashion a genie prison out of any container. He kept three such prisons within his shop. They contained a slayer genie, an efreeti, and a noble dao and sold for 2,000 dinars.
A small fire gen served as Essafahs familiar. Since he was terrified that an angry genie would one day track him down and slay him, a pair of guardian genies served as his loyal bodyguards.
