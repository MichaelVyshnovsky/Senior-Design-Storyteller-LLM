'''Essafah al-Jamila''' was a [[sha'ir]] and shopkeeper who lived in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|57}}

==Activities==
Essahah's shop, called [[Items for the Immortals]], catered to [[genie]]s and other sha'irs.

Essafah specialized in the creation of [[genie prison]]s, usually in the form of a lamp or bottle, though he claimed he could fashion a genie prison out of any container. He kept three such prisons within his shop. They contained a [[slayer genie]], an [[efreeti]], and a [[noble dao]] and sold for 2,000 [[dinar]]s.

==Relationships==
A small [[fire gen]] served as Essafah's [[familiar]]. Since he was terrified that an angry genie would one day track him down and slay him, a pair of [[guardian genie]]s served as his loyal bodyguards.
