        "History": "In 1358 DR, just after the start of the [[Time of Troubles]], Arashta was in [[Daggerdale]] with the mission to kill [[Randal Morn]]. Suddenly her god [[Bane]] appeared in front of her, saying that she would became his chosen tyrant in [[Faer√ªn]] if she could kill [[Elminster Aumar]] and that Randal was not an important being in his plots. Quickly Arashta went to kill the Old Mage, not knowing that \"Bane\" was [[Issaran]] of the [[malaugrym]].\n\nArashta attacked Elminster, who was together the [[Rangers Three]] and others allies, alongside a band of [[hobgoblin]]s but she failed in her assassination. [[Sharantyr]] attacked Arashta that managed to cast a defense [[spell]] but, as often in [[Time of Troubles]], her spell no worked and Sharantyr killed her."
