Sothal was present while the Sheik had an audience with the adventurers who ultimately released [[Martek]].\n\nShe was aware of several things regarding the oasis. She knew some within the tribe had returned to worshiping idols, rather than Anu; she also believed that some in the Sheik's guard plotted to assassinate him as soon as he went out to search for the princess, and someone in court was a party to this plot.\n\nShe also believed the reason why [[Tolnus Granicus]] of the Sandvoyagers' Guild had not been seen for some time was that he had been the victim of foul play."
