Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldur's Gate closed the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Monifa Diallo, Kimmy's mother, believed the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] did not care for the looming danger and possible deaths of everyone in Rivington. However, she did not wish to scare Kimmy."
