'''Wingham''', often called '''Weird Wingham''', was an old [[half-orc]] of [[Damara]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Wingham was old, bald, and limping, with his stature bent by age, but with a sparkle in his bright eyes locking the stares of any young woman. He often spoke with a lyrical barker's voice, mastered in his decades with his traveling troupe.

==Relationships==
Wingham was the uncle of the wizard [[Arrayan Faylin|Arrayan]]; they had deep affection for one another.

==Activities==
He was the head of a traveling merchant band called Wingham's Rascals, better known as [[Weird Wingham's Wacky Weapon Wielders]] who traveled the [[Bloodstone Lands]] with their twenty colored wagons. Bards and jugglers accompanied the merchants to entertain with song and dance and artistry. The troupe traded exotic goods, weapons, and clothes from faraway lands and wondrous tales of distant heroes and mighty villains.
