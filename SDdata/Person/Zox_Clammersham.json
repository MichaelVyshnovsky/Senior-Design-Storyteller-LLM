        "mainbody": "'''Zox Clammersham''' was a [[rock gnome]] [[archmage]] and adventurer who settled within [[Undermountain]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He claimed a small lair that came to be known as [[Clammersham Palace]], settled down and retired from the life of adventuring.",
        "Relationships": "Following the death of his comrades, Zox was left alone within [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] of Undermountain. After some time, he gained the company of an [[amulet]]-less [[shield guardian]] known as [[Rex (construct)|Rex]], who served as his bodyguard, along with a [[giant badger]] he kept as a pet. \n\nZox was extremely fearful of the [[hobgoblin]]s that invaded the Graveyard during the 15{{th}} century. He maintained a friendship with the local [[azer]] and [[lava children]], who he referred to as the \"burning men\" and \"smileys\".",
        "Possessions": "In addition to the ring that granted Zox control over the graveyard's [[scaladar]], he kept a number of interesting and valuable items within his private chambers. He had a set of ''[[Nolzur's marvelous pigments]]'' and a small, ordinary [[music box]] that played a simple tune.",
        "History": "Some time before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Zox and his adventuring party delved into Undermountain, but were mostly slain. Zox survived and settled into a life of solitude for some time, having lost all track of time along with any semblance of socialization. He managed to sustain himself on the fungi that grew near the lair of a nearby group of [[myconid]]. \n\nZox managed to claim one of ''[[Trobriand's ring]]s'', which allowed him control over the scaladar found within the Graveyard. Using them as a labor force, Zox managed to create the ''[[Simulacrux]]'', a gargantuan machine that replicated scaladar by means of a modified ''[[simulacrum]]'' [[spell]] that used rust as its [[material component]]."
