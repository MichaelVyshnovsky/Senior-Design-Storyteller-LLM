'''Graendel Granitefist''' was a [[dwarf]] smith from [[Mithral Hall]] and the proprietor of the [[Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft]] in [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
He hailed from [[Mithral Hall]], but following its fall in the latter half of the 12{{th}} century [[DR]], he he came with [[Clan Battlehammer]] and the other refugees to resettle in Icewind Dale. He took up work as a smith and, by the late 15{{th}} century, he had been carrying on his trade in Targos since before the other townsfolk's grandparents were born.

By that time, Graendel was the last living witness in town to [[Akar Kessell]]'s destructive attack on Targos with a beam from [[Cryshal-Tirith]] and the occupation by his forces, in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}. The aged dwarf would still tell the story of that time, usually to customers who could go nowhere else.

==Activities==
Graendel forged a variety of metalwork, from pieces of [[armor]] to blades for [[weapon]]s to anchors for the town's fishing boats. He crafted every piece to order and his attention to detail and quality meant they were perfectly fitted to the user's specifications. However, his work was slow as a result, so most people went to one of the regular smiths in Targos for basic tools or quick armor patches. Nevertheless, ''circa'' [[1485 DR]], guards came here all the way from [[Bryn Shander]] to get their armor repaired or adjusted and to, unwillingly, hear his stories.
