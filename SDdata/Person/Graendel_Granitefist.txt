Graendel Granitefist was a dwarf smith from Mithral Hall and the proprietor of the Graendels Fine Dwarven Craft in Targos in Icewind Dale in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
He hailed from Mithral Hall, but following its fall in the latter half of the 12 century DR, he he came with Clan Battlehammer and the other refugees to resettle in Icewind Dale. He took up work as a smith and, by the late 15 century, he had been carrying on his trade in Targos since before the other townsfolks grandparents were born.
By that time, Graendel was the last living witness in town to Akar Kessells destructive attack on Targos with a beam from Cryshal-Tirith and the occupation by his forces, in the . The aged dwarf would still tell the story of that time, usually to customers who could go nowhere else.
Graendel forged a variety of metalwork, from pieces of armor to blades for weapons to anchors for the towns fishing boats. He crafted every piece to order and his attention to detail and quality meant they were perfectly fitted to the users specifications. However, his work was slow as a result, so most people went to one of the regular smiths in Targos for basic tools or quick armor patches. Nevertheless, circa 1485 DR, guards came here all the way from Bryn Shander to get their armor repaired or adjusted and to, unwillingly, hear his stories.
