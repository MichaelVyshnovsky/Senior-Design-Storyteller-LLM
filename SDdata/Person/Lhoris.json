        "mainbody": "horis was a fiery-tempered human from Fireshear who was an apprentice of Blackstaff Tower.\nLhoris had flaming red hair. At the age of fifteen years, he was not very muscly.\nWhen Lhoris grew angry—which was frequent—his skin color almost matched that of his hair. His peers even referred to him as \"the angry one\".\nLhoris was schooled by senior apprentice Tsarra Chaadren.\nFellow apprentice Traya Ginara appeared to have had a crush on him.\nOriginally from Fireshear, Lhoris was brought to the Blackstaff Tower at the age of ten years. Tsarra was curious as to the source of his anger but waited to look deeper into the matter. In the interim, she attempted to steer his abilities in sorcery and wizardry away from any magic that his temper could use to cause harm.\nOn 28 Uktar of the , when Lhorik was 15 years old, he was a member of a group of eight apprentices, including his teacher, who spent an overnight hunting trip in the Pellamcopse Woods. He lacked the strength to move the doe that Tsarra had shot alone and his peer Trehgan assisted him.\nWhen they arrived back at the tower, he was one of four tasked with butchering the game that they had taken and was in the kitchens when an explosion destroyed one of the walls of the tower."
