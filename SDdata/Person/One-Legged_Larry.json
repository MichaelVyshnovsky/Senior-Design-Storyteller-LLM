        "mainbody": "ne-Legged Larry was a pirate from Luskan during the late 15 century DR.\nOne-Legged Larry was bald, with a big grey beard, and an eye-patch over one eye. He often hung around the Cutlass, and his drink of choice was Waterdhavian Fire Ale.\nSome time around 1490 DR, Burkins tricked the Champion of the Burning Dawn into believing that One-Legged Larry had recently acquired a new peg leg in the form of a powerful artifact during an overseas raid."
