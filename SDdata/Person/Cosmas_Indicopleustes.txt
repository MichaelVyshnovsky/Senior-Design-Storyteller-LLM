Cosmas Indicopleustes was a notable merchant traveling the Hordelands in 1358 DR.
Cosmas was honest, but didnt let that particular trait impede his craftiness.
Because of his obese frame, Cosmas was constantly sweaty.
Cosmas invested heavily in a particular caravan, hoping his gamble would pay handsomely. Since he borrowed much of the gold needed to fund his expedition, he worried about anything interfering with the caravans success.
Cosmas was originally from Impiltur.
