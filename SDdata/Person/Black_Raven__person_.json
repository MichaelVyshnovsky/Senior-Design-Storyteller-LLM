He appeared to be a dark-skinned man with eyes burning with resolve. Historians speculated that he couldve been a drow or a half-drow man, yet others presumed the Black Raven was a quasi-deity that stood against oppression.\nThe legendary Black Raven was thought to be a spirit of vengeance that emerged from the underworld among Uthgardt barbarians. The Black Raven taught them humility and broke their arrogance. Epic legends told stories of the Ravens fight against evil-doers and slaves across North Faerûn and southern kingdoms.\nThe Black Ravens legacy was preserved in the form of a secluded monastic order with its monastery on the Spine of the World."
