        "mainbody": "The '''Black Raven''' was a near mythical figure among the [[Uthgardt]] people of [[North Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "The Black Raven wore bloodied chains hanging from his wrists. He appeared to be a dark-skinned man with eyes burning with resolve. Historians speculated that he could've been a [[drow]] or a [[half-drow]] man, yet others presumed the Black Raven was a quasi-deity that stood against oppression.",
        "History": "The legendary Black Raven was thought to be a spirit of vengeance that emerged from the underworld among Uthgardt [[barbarian]]s. The Black Raven taught them humility and broke their arrogance. Epic legends told stories of the Raven's fight against evil-doers and slaves across North Faerûn and southern kingdoms.\n\nThe Black Raven's legacy was preserved in the form of a secluded monastic order with its monastery on the [[Spine of the World]]."
