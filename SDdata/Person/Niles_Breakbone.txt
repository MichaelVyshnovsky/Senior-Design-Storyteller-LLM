==Personality==
Niles was a devout servant of Tyr He was a dedicated member of the Order of the Gauntlet and was seen as representing its best qualities, although the stain of the jungle campaign had led him to become desperate and unreasonable. He viewed Camp Vengeance as existing in a permanent state of emergency, and anyone who refused his orders&mdash;regardless of their relationship to the Order of the Gauntlet&mdash;was deemed a traitor to be punished or executed.

==Activities==
Niles commanded a force of over fifty soldiers, [[templar]]s, and [[scout]]s, although their combat readiness was often hobbled by [[disease]]. He directed them to combat and purge the surrounding jungle of [[undead]] to little success. He tried to ensure that his forces had enough [[canoe]]s or [[rowboat]]s on hand to ferry them all to safety in case of an evacuation of Camp Vengeance, but was severely short-staffed in terms of both boats and hands to row them. Likewise, he was eager to conscriot any passing [[adventurer]]s who had demonstrated the skills to survive in the treacherous jungles.

Commander Breakbone was largely unable or uninterested in managing his Camp as he found the needs of his jungle campaign to be well outside of his expertise and comfort. He was prone to spend his days studying outdated [[map]]s of Chult and reviewing reports about supplies

==Relationships==

He oversaw a number of key lieutenants, many of whom demonstrated greater competence than he and thus would sometimes push back against his more unreasonable orders. These included Captains [[Ord Firebeard]] and [[Perne Salhana]] (leading the troops), Sister [[Cyas]] (leading the Camp's [[acolyte]]s), and [[Lorsa Bilwatal]] (who headed a group of [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] scouts and guides). His expedition was also joined by one of his personal friends, the scout [[Wulf Rygor]].

Niles grew suspicious of the old witch [[Nanny Pu'pu]] at [[Mbala]].

His struggles at Camp Vengeance&mdash;if not his failures&mdash;were known to [[Alastar Bol]], the Order of the Gauntlet's agent in [[Port Nyanzaru]],{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|33}} and the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] [[Wakanga O'tamu]].

==History==
Commander Breakbone worked hard to avoid repeating the disaster of [[Camp Righteous]], However, he proved to be woefully inept at adapting to the jungle conditions.

During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} he came to suspect that Nanny Pu'pu knew something about the curse. His suspicions made their way to Wakanga O'tamu, who came to believe that Niles might know something about the curse's origins.
