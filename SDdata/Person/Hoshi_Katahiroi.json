        "mainbody": "Hoshi Katahiroi was a daimyo of a province in Kara-Tur.It is unknown where in Kara-Tur Wa and Kozakura are two likely candidates.\nSome time before the mid–14 century DR,The date is unknown this is only \"many years ago\" from a presumed setting date of 1357 DR. The Faerûnian calendar is used in the absence of any other. Hoshis province was devastated by severe tempests and lightning strikes that ignited fires. Hoshis respected shukenja advisors quickly divined that this weather was not natural, but the work of a mighty dragon of a type never encountered before, dubbed \"Celestial Fury\". Some thought it arose from the primal chaos of a time before Kara-Turs creation, others that it was a modern abomination.\nHoshi wished the dragon dead to spare his province more devastation. Thus he commissioned a reclusive weaponsmith and master of mystic arts named Chigatta to forge for him a weapon that could destroy the dragons spirit as well as its body. Chigatta created a katana, more fine than anyone couldve imagined, and gave it the name of the dragon it was meant to slay, Celestial Fury.\nThe sword was imbued with the power of flight and so Hoshi took to the skies to hunt the dragon through the storm clouds. For days, a dragons roars and a mans shouts echoed across the skies, and lightning flashed through the nights. Finally, Hoshi was victorious, slaying the dragons body and trapping its spirit inside his sword. The two Celestial Furies became one and the swords order was imposed on the dragons chaos.\nTo celebrate his triumph, and cement the dragons defeat, Hoshi then asked Chigatta to craft a scabbard from the dragons hide and to embed the dragons magical pearl in the hilt.\nUnfortunately, while Hoshi was a great warrior, he was weak of will and the dragons spirit possessed him. Under the dragons control, Hoshi killed first Chigatta, and then himself. The blade disappeared shortly afterward, probably abandoned by Hoshis grief-stricken family."
