'''Wessalen Arturia''' was a [[human]] [[paladin]] of [[Lathander]] from [[Cimbar]], [[Chessenta]]. He sailed the [[Pirate Isles]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Activities==
Wessalen was a [[Chessenta]]n noble and a follower of [[Lathander]]. His goal was to restore his home country to its former glory and reunite the fractious city-states into an empire, which he believed would lead the [[Inner Sea]] into a golden age of prosperity and unity.

He discovered from records in his temple in [[Cimbar]] that a very powerful [[artifact]] essential to the spread of the ancient [[Chessentan Empire]] had been lost on the Pirate Isles before the empire's decline. He knew almost nothing about this artifact but believed that Lathander would guide him. He traveled all over the isles in search of ancient Chessentan ruins. However, he feared that someone else would want the artifact for personal profit and did not wish to inadvertently give away a vital clue to its nature or location, so he was tight-lipped about his quest.

Although not seeking battle, his secretive habits led him into several conflicts with the inhabitants, and he in turn adopted more hostile, defensive attitudes.
 
==Personality==
Wessalen had not truly thought about what would happen to [[Faer√ªn]] if he succeeded in his mission of restoring the empire. He was generally friendly if approached in a friendly manner, but quick to defend himself if attacked. He worshiped Lathander as an athlete's patron and was always happy to have a friendly wrestling match.

==Description==
A dedicated athlete, Wessalen was tall, slender, and strong with a toned physique. He had curly blond hair.

==Abilities & Skills==
Wessalen was proficient in the [[longsword]] and [[javelin]], in unarmed punching and wrestling. He specialized in fighting with weapon and shield.

He was knowledgeable in etiquette, healing, seamanship, weaponsmithing, and ancient Chessentan history. He was also good at running and in endurance.

==Possessions==
He wore ''+2 [[scale mail]]'' and ''[[gloves of missile snaring]]'', and fought with a ''+1 [[shield]]'' and ''+1 [[longsword]]''. He also owned three ''[[javelin of lightning|javelins of lightning]]'', a ''[[potion of speed]]'', and a ''[[potion of extra-healing]]''.

He also commanded the ''[[Argosy]]'', a [[longship]] crewed by 70 crack sailors.
