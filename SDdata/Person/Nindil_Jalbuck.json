He wore clothes befitting those of his profession but had the unique adornment of a nose ring.\nWhen traveling beyond Waterdeep he wore a suit of chainmail armor that bore the symbol of the Chauntean temple-farm of Goldenfields.\nNindil was originally from Secomber but went to Waterdeep in search of fortune. While he initially earned his keep by working as a thief, he soon inserted himself into the citys information network as a broker.\nAfter some time in the Waterdhavian underworld, up until about the , Nindil turned his life around and opened the Garrulous Grocer.

His presence on the council represented the common folk of the city.\nUnfortunately, Nindils identity was compromised in the  by Mather Ukkhemn one of the nefarious Knights of the Shield.
