'''Bea Farbough''' was a farmer in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Harried in Hillsfar|9}}

==History==
Bea and her husband [[Ebenz Farbough]] managed a farmhouse near [[Hillsfar]]. When the city's First Lord [[Torin Nomerthal]] proclaimed again the Great Law of Humanity, expelling all non-[[human]]s, Ebenz and Bea decided to house the ten abandoned children living in [[Madame Delilah's Home for Orphaned Children]], and because Bea couldn't have children.

A year later, however, Bea gave birth to six sons, so things became even more chaotic.

Trouble arrived the year after when the [[Rage of Demons]] began and the [[tiefling]] boy [[Pynroth]] disappeared.
