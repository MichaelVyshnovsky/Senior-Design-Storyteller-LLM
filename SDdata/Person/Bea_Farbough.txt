Bea Farbough was a farmer in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Bea and her husband Ebenz Farbough managed a farmhouse near Hillsfar. When the citys First Lord Torin Nomerthal proclaimed again the Great Law of Humanity, expelling all non-humans, Ebenz and Bea decided to house the ten abandoned children living in Madame Delilahs Home for Orphaned Children, and because Bea couldnt have children.
A year later, however, Bea gave birth to six sons, so things became even more chaotic.
Trouble arrived the year after when the Rage of Demons began and the tiefling boy Pynroth disappeared.
