        "mainbody": "Brother '''Satarin''' was a [[dwarf]] priest in [[Helm's Hold]] near [[Neverwinter]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Satarin took care of the crazed inmates of the Cathedral.",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, he noted that the madness that had spread in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Night of the Madness]] had transferred to Helm's Hold. So he sent a letter to an adventuring party that had come to be involved in the matter. Soon after, however, Helm's Hold fell under the control of the [[Elden Vargas|Tormentor]] and his mind-thrall minions.",
        "Personality": "His long exposure to crazed people had slightly confused Satarin."
