        "History": "Shedrak went with an adventuring party to Wormwrithings. However, the others were captured and killed by a beholder, [[Karazikar]]. Through great luck, Shedrak survived its eye rays. Intrigued, Karazikar decided to make him its slave, and he soon became its favorite.\n\n''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], an expedition led by some adventurers, hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] to investigate the threat of the [[demon lord]]s, came to Wormwrithings. They were in need of the central eye of a beholder for a rite to banish the demon lords. Shedrak was confronted and possibly killed along with his master by the adventurers.",
        "Personality": "Karazikar had broken Shedrak's mind in order to make him its slave. Shedrak considered the beholder a god and would not tolerate any impudence or resistance to the beholder."
