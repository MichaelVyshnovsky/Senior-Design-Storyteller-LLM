'''Lord Siirist''' was an inhabitant of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He participated in a covert meeting in support of the [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim]]. There, he voiced his opinion of the sorceresses protecting the Coronal, whom he despectively called "The Six Kissing Sisters", as less than certainly capable of fending off a concerted attack.
