        "mainbody": "'''Veera Wavecrest''' was a female [[Chondathan]] [[human]] [[rogue]] [[sorceress]] and a pirate from the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the 14th century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Veera was a pirate captain of the Vilhon Reach who venerated both [[Umberlee]] and [[Mystra]], thanks to her sorcerous powers.\n\nIn the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], she sailed to [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] in need of repairs to her ship, far from the waters where she normally operated. There she visited the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] to pay homage to her goddess, and partook in the three-day ritual of Mystra's Sacred Trust. But then she was [[Dominate person|''dominated'']] with the ''[[Starry Gnosis]]'' and abducted by [[Shar]]ran [[Church of Shar|clerics]] posing as Mystran clerics. Fortunately for her, there was no room on [[Mhair]]'s boat to the [[Lost Refuge]], and she was kept in a cage beneath the temple.\n\nEventually, she was freed by some adventurers recruited to investigate the strange behavior of these false Mystran clerics."
