        "mainbody": "Veera Wavecrest was a female Chondathan human rogue sorceress and a pirate from the Vilhon Reach in the 14th century DR.\nVeera was a pirate captain of the Vilhon Reach who venerated both Umberlee and Mystra, thanks to her sorcerous powers.\nIn the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, she sailed to Wheloon in Cormyr in need of repairs to her ship, far from the waters where she normally operated. There she visited the Temple of Mystra to pay homage to her goddess, and partook in the three-day ritual of Mystras Sacred Trust. But then she was dominated with the Starry Gnosis and abducted by Sharran clerics posing as Mystran clerics. Fortunately for her, there was no room on Mhairs boat to the Lost Refuge, and she was kept in a cage beneath the temple.\nEventually, she was freed by some adventurers recruited to investigate the strange behavior of these false Mystran clerics."
