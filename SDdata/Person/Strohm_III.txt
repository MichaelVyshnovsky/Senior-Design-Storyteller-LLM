King Strohm III was a king of Tethyr.
Strohm III was rumored to have been a giant. In any case, he was peerless as a warrior, and many tales were told of his great prowess in combat.
Strohm III was the great-great-great-grandson of Strohm II, who was a half-elf and thus long-lived, which was why Strohm III succeeded his great-great-great-grandfather as king of Tethyr instead of his own father.
Strohm III had at least three sons.
Strohm III was born in the Year of the Hungry Jaws, 715 DR. He was crowned king at the age of twenty years in the Year of the Prophets Child, 735 DR.
Strohm III fought many wars during his reign as king,
Upon Strohms death in 769 DR, his third son and a warrior like his father, Strohm IV, became king in his stead.
His tomb was located in the Windspear Hills.
A tale was often told of how Strohm and his general alone slew 5,000 drow during a battle that lasted two full days. This battle took place on a hill known as Argentor in the eastern Marching Mountains during a solar eclipse.
