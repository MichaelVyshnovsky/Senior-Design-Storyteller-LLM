        "Relationships": "Endren deeply cared for his son [[Abelar Corrinthal|Abelar]] and was really concerned about his grandson [[Elden Corrinthal|Elden]]. He had the appreciation of all his citizens and of many people across [[Sembia]].",
        "History": "Endren had always been am influential councilor in Sembia. In the month of [[Marpenoth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Overmaster [[Kendrick Selkirk]] suffered a sudden death, and Eldren emerged as the most likely choice for succession. His appointment was opposed only by Countess [[Mirabeta Selkirk]]. Thanks to the plotting of [[Elyril Hraven]], Endren was falsely accused of murdering the Overmaster and he was put under arrest. After Mirabeta was elected as acting Overmistress, she ordered the lord of Saerb imprisoned inside the [[Hole]] prison in [[Yhaunn]].\n\nHowever, Endren was rescued by the [[Chosen]] of [[Mask]] [[Erevis Cale]] and [[Drasek Riven]], supported by some [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm]]. Later on, Endren was safely returned to his son Abelar, as he and his men rode towards Saerb.\n\nWhen he heard about the sack of [[Corrinthal Estate]] and the abduction of his grandson, Endren tried to comfort Abelar. Afterward, Endren assisted Abelar in leading the Saerb refugees to [[Daerlun]]."
