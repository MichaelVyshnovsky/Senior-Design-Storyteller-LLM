Oznod Brekker was a human fighter in the service of Lord Vorik Aris of Cormyr, who operated in the Stonelands around 1369 DR.
Oznod was a clever and quick-witted man, though not as charming as he hoped.
He carried a +1 longsword and wore chain mail, and had a potion of healing for emergencies. His duties across the Stonelands were aided by a light warhorse.
In the , he served Lord Aris as leader of a group of six scouts in the region around Wyvernwatch Castle. His mission was to find treasure hunters in Halfhap that intended to explore the area, and kill them before they stumbled upon Wyvernwatch, where Lord Aris was secretly building up his forces. 
He worked alongside the sorceress Winaneh Marlowson, but his attempts at seduction led to rejection. Although he hated her for this, they still had to perform their work together.
