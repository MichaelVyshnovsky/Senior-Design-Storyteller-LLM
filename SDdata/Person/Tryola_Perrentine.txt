'''Tryola Perrentine''' was a minor noblewoman from [[Tilverton]] and the sister of [[Devana Melshimber|Devana Perrentine]], who married into the [[Melshimber]] family from [[Waterdeep]] in [[1368 DR]].

==Personality==
Tryola Perrentine was a brave and resourceful woman, even though sheltered by her family's noble status.

==Abilities==
Tryola was a quick learner. Among other survival techniques, her [[ranger]] brother taught her some of the [[Orc language]].

==History==
In 1370 DR, Tryola Perrentine was to attend the wedding of her sister Devana and [[Rivven Melshimber]] in [[Waterdeep]]. During her travel to the City of Splendors for the ceremony, she somehow ended up in [[Skullport]], where she was ambushed by a band of [[orc]]s. The orcs who snatched the noblewoman were a part of the marauders of [[Horazak]]. Tryola was taken to an ancient prison and mines in [[Undermountain]] that once belonged to [[Clan Melairkyn]]. She hoped to get rescued, but with time passing, she realized that her family likely thought her dead. Not losing hope, she befriended a fellow prisoner, a [[dwarf]] named [[Urkantor]] of [[Clangeddin's Hearth]]. Together they managed to escape the prison and slip into the mines to the orc leader's unending rage. Even though the two were soon recaptured, they were granted freedom after [[Khelbenite]], a trusted adventurer agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]], infiltrated the prison and decimated the orc forces. Thankful for the aid, Tryola told the adventurer all the things she overheard in Orcish while imprisoned, namely of Horazak's unholy alliance with the [[drow]] who plotted Waterdeep's downfall.
