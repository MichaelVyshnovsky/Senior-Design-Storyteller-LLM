        "mainbody": "'''Melkar of Mirabar''' was a [[mage]] who tried to breach the protections around [[Ahghairon's Tower]] in [[1271 DR]] (although his identity was not public knowledge). He failed, having misjudged the number of keys needed by half. His skeleton remained hanging inside the protections as a warning.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], Melkar's journal was retrieved by [[Samark Dhanzscul|Samark \"the Blackstaff\" Dhanzscul]] from the tomb of [[Khelben Arunsun]]. It fell into the hands of Samark's killers, [[Khondar Naomal|Khondar]] and [[Centiv Naomal]], who used it to determine the number of keys needed to enter the tower.",
