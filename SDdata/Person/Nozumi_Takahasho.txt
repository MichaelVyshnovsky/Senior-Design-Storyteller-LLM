'''Nozumi Takahasho''' was a broken soldier in [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
Nozumi Takahasho was a soldier of the army of General [[Goyat Nagumo]]. In [[1358 DR]], during the army's journey through the [[Kutuk Valley]] he was captured by [[Taring]] savages. Nozumi managed to escape but was infected by a variety of jungle diseases that nearly destroyed his mind. He managed to get back to [[Suijeng]] just before the [[Komite]]. He wandered the city exhausted, weakened, starving, and thirsty. If questioned, he tried to tell his story but couldn't remember the details, eventually collapsing to the ground, sobbing and shaking.
