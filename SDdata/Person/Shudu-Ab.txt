'''Shudu-Ab''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Tiamat]] in [[Unther]] in [[1357 DR]] and [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Originally, Shudu-Ab was the right hand of high priestess [[Tiglath]] but broke with her in search of power. After Tiglath's disappearance during the [[Godswar]], Shudu-Ab became the new high priestess.

However, she and all her followers were in [[Unthalass]] during [[Mulhorand]]'s attack on that city and she was presumed dead like her followers while the resurfaced Tiglath regained her position. However, Shudu-Ab was still alive and in 1374 DR she was waiting for the right time to reappear and regain her power.  

She created the first [[Rod of the Dark Lady]].

==Personality==
Shudu-Ab saw the church of Tiamat only as a means to gain power. She planned to kill Tiglath and rule Unther as a representative of Tiamat.
