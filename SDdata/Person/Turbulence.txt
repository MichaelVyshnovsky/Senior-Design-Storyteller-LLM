Turbulence was a tiefling wizard who lived in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR. She was the sister of Violence together, they were called the Horned Sisters.
Turbulence and her sister were students of the magical school on the Dweomercore level of Undermountain. 
Violence and Turbulence tried to join the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan but were rejected. For few years, they worked as pirate wizards until they settled in Skullport. There they heard about Dweomercore, which they quickly found and joined sometime before 1492 DR. 
Turbulence and her sister were unsatisfied with the teaching of the academy and wanted to leave but the headmaster would permit to them to leave.
Turbulence was always with her sister Violence. Wormriddle kept an eye on the sisters.
