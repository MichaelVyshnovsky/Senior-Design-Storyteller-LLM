        "mainbody": "Seenroas Halvinhar was the High Priestess of Tymora in the Tower of Luck temple of Waterdeep in the mid to lateâ€“14 century DR.Seenroas name is spelled \"Seenrosa\" in the The Savage Frontier. In her prior appearance, Waterdeep and the North, as well as all subsequent appearances the name is spelled \"Seenroas.\" Therefore, this can be assumed as a typo.\nOn the month of Eleint, in the year 336 NR (1368 DR), Seenroas ordered the young priest Adama Miiralin to set down an account of all the latest activity and news surrounding the Yawning Portal and Undermountain. As he had spent much of his time providing for the risk-takers who exited and sought to enter that dungeon complex."
