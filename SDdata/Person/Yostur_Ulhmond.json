However, they soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Yostur, together with Feenoch the Five-Fingered, made it to Orm to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in Hillsfar they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing sledges, perhaps intending to return.\nAt the time, Yostur was young, with blond hair and described as strong as an ox.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryAdventurers\nCategoryMembers of the Snow People\nCategoryInhabitants of Thar\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n9ghlhr1nxtmysd0vdmqpib2cv7b6m6q"
