        "mainbody": "'''Yostur Ulhmond''' was a [[fighter]] from the villages of the [[Snow People]] of [[Thar]] in the 1350s [[DR]].\n\nIn the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], Yostur was a member of a band of adventurers that rediscovered the fabled [[Barroch's Hold]] in the [[Glacier of the White Worm]]. However, they soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Yostur, together with [[Feenoch|Feenoch the Five-Fingered]], made it to [[Orm]] to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in [[Hillsfar]] they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing sledges, perhaps intending to return.\n\nAt the time, Yostur was young, with blond hair and described as strong as an ox.",
