        "mainbody": "etra, also known as Ossalurkarif amongst dragons, She specialized in dragons.\nShe was small, had fair hair, and was somewhat swarthy.\nPetra usually spoke little. She had less than no regard for those who tried to cheat her.\nPetra was a superb painter, and had mastered survival skills that served her everywhere there were dragons, having gone into volcanoes, marshes, and labyrinths to paint them. Naturally, she also spoke Draconic.\nShe carried a number of rolled tubes, all of them containing pictures of different dragons that shed sketched out or painted herself. one last small paintbrush was tipped with gold. Besides a number of colors, she had a silver-wrapped ivory jar that contained a paint of indistinct color, but which she used to paint a dragons green eyes.\nDuring the middle of winter of the , Petra stopped at the Sembian town of Halfknot to wait for the roads to dry out. While at the town, she repainted the signs for a few businesses the town baker, butcher, and hostler. She agreed to do the sign of the Dragon Defeated, a local inn, too, for a few meals. Varney, the owner of the Dragon Defeated, accepted, and commissioned her a sign of a dead green dragon, with a princess, and three regulars at his tavern as the slayers Wyrmbait Nix, Silvenestri Silver, and Badger Bates.\nTendays later, on her last night at the town, she spoke up during the nightly tales at the Dragon Defeated, which had a prize for the most awe-inspiring story. She revealed she was a painter of dragons, and that she knew of them. Showing the people at the tavern some samples of her work, she explained that shed traveled the width and breadth of the Realms to look at dragons and paint them. She considered shed shown more of dragons than anyone in the entire season, and that she should be given the prize for the evening. Petra related that by 1362 DR, she had painted a hundred or so green dragons, talked to white dragons, and mentioned that shed drawn copper dragons at the High Moor, and all manner of the best-known dragons. Badger Bates, however, demanded that only a painting of Malaeragoth, of which shed not shown, would make it worth giving her the money. Despite her insistence that shed painted Malaeragoth from life once, and that hed sent a servant to steal the painting afterwards, she agreed to do it.\nNo matter how much detail she added, however, Badger was left unsatisfied, demanding to see the eyes of Malaeragoth painted, and then painted in the correct shade. She had some apprehensions and warned them, but still painted a picture of Malaeragoth scrying on the inn. After completing her picture, she claimed the prize, and left quickly, before Malaeragoth somehow entered the tavern through her painting and rampaged inside the building, destroying it completely, and killing Badger Bates in the process.\nShe later relayed through Wyrmbait Nix that she was sorry for what happened, but that Bates shouldnt have cheated on the bet, and that shed go further east, to study landwyrms."
