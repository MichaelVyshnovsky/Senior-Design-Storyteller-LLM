Audara Imryth was a cleric of Mystra and a potion-seller in Westgate in 1370 DR.
Secretly, she was a member of the Harpers, watching over the city. Audara was affiliated with the Harper branch based in Shadowdale and had a strained relationship with fellow local Harper Jamal, whom she did not trust. In case of necessity, she would agree to work with her, however.
