'''Audara Imryth''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Mystra]] and a potion-seller in [[Westgate]] in [[1370 DR]].

Secretly, she was a member of the [[Harpers]], watching over the city. Audara was affiliated with the Harper branch based in [[Shadowdale]] and had a strained relationship with fellow local Harper [[Jamal]], whom she did not trust. In case of necessity, she would agree to work with her, however.
