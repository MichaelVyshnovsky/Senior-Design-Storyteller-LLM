        "mainbody": "'''Feenoch the Five-Fingered''' was an infamous rogue and [[adventurer]] of the 1350s [[DR]].\n\nIn the [[1356 DR|Year of the Worm, 1356 DR]], Feenoch was a member of a band of adventurers that rediscovered the fabled [[Barroch's Hold]] in the [[Glacier of the White Worm]]. However, they soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Feenoch, together with [[Yostur Ulhmond]], made it to [[Orm]] to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in [[Hillsfar]] they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing sledges, perhaps intending to return.",
