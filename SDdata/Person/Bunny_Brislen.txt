==Description==
Like the rest of her family, Bunny was a [[human]] with a tan skin tone and hazel eyes. She had light strawberry blonde hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Dharin Brislen attempted to ship Leepak and their daughters away from the Gate. He attempted to negotiate a passage to [[Waterdeep]] with Captain [[Sleam]], a smuggler with her own boat and crew. Sleam asked for too much money, claiming it was a life-and-death situation for her crew too. Dharin could not afford to pay for four seats, so he resorted to staying behind. It was unknown if Leepak and the girls escaped the Gate before the battle of the [[Upper City]] commenced.
