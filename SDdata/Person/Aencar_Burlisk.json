        "History": {
            "Childhood": "It was unknown when Aencar was born, but he was raised by elves in [[Battledale]], where he learned military strategy, forestry, and other skills, not to mention wisdom, that would become essential during his later rule of the Dales. When he grew older, Aencar left Battledale with a group of mercenaries known as the [[Mailed Mantle]]. The sellswords were a Sembian mercenary group that found great success battling corruption in [[Sembia]] for various employers. But eventually corrupt Sembians and other foes they had made put a bounty on their heads and the Mailed Mantle returned to Battledale.",
            "Ascent to King": "There, Aencar found his people being oppressed by corrupt merchants and common thieves. The Mailed Mantle set to work to clear them out of Battledale,<ref>\n\nIn his nine years as the ruler of Battledale, Aencar did not sit idly. He looked after the Dalefolk in Battledale and he adventured against their enemies. The Mailed Mantle patrolled Battledale, and visitors of Battledale noted its strong and competent leader.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1038}}, Aencar then began his campaign to unify the Dales, adopting the title the Mantled King. He persuaded some to join his cause, such as [[Tasseldale]] and [[Shadowdale]], and against the others he struck swiftly and surely, putting Mantle members in seats of power across the Dales. Aencar ruled the majority of the Dales for six more years, and he ruled them as masterfully as he ruled Battledale in his previous years.",
            "Death": "In the {{YearlinkName|1044}}, One of the evil mages was [[Alacanther|Alacanther of Arrabar]], who burned down Aencar's keep.",
            "Legacy": "Following Aencar's death, the Dalelands divided into independent communities, yet they remained allied.\n\nThe ruins of Aencar's castle could be seen from [[Rauthauvyr's Ride]], the road running to the [[Standing Stone]], and it was not reoccupied after his death. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ruler of Essembra and Battledale's delegate to the [[Dales Council]] was [[Ilmeth|Chancellor Ilmeth]], a descendant of Aencar's chief swordcaptain.<ref>\n\nA statue of Aencar was later erected in the center of Essembra,<ref> on the site of the cottage where the previous Battledarran heroine [[Essembramaerytha|Essembra]] had been born over a century earlier.<ref>\n\nEven in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Battledarran folk who grew up in sight of Aencar's castle felt pride in their warrior heritage.<ref>"
