'''Himeji''' was a [[samurai]] captain of the [[Korimori clan]] in [[Maeshi Province]] in [[Kozakura]] ''circa'' {{yearlinkConvert|1433|KY}}.

==Relationships==
Himeji was a lieutenant of [[Ogaki]], the second-in-command of Lord [[Korimori]].

Himeji and rival lieutenant [[Sakigahara]] disliked each other and both wanted Ogaki's position if he was promoted after their lord's victory.

==History==
In 1433 SY, Ogaki, Himeji, and Sakigahara led a [[bushi]] army to a village formally of the [[Michimori clan]]. There, however, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to retrieve the [[Seven Swords]] may have fought and defeated them and their troops.
