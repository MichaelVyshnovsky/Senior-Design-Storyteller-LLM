Himeji was a samurai captain of the Korimori clan in Maeshi Province in Kozakura circa .
Himeji was a lieutenant of Ogaki, the second-in-command of Lord Korimori.
Himeji and rival lieutenant Sakigahara disliked each other and both wanted Ogakis position if he was promoted after their lords victory.
In 1433 SY, Ogaki, Himeji, and Sakigahara led a bushi army to a village formally of the Michimori clan. There, however, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to retrieve the Seven Swords may have fought and defeated them and their troops.
