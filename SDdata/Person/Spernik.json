        "mainbody": "Spernik was a member of the Cult of the Dragon in Phlan during the Tyranny of Dragons.\nSpernik was constantly nervous, and stammered and sweated when under pressure. But his promotion thrilled him, so Spernik told everyone who would listen that was a top leader in the Cult.\nIn battle, Spernik wore leather armor and fought with a dagger.\nSpernik was a cultist cleric of Tiamat who had infiltrated Phlan for a long time. He stole a book from Mantors Library in order to instigate a red dragon to attack the city. However, thanks to some adventurers, he was defeated in the end and arrested by the Knights of the Black Fist.\nHis trial became a long-running case, a fact that concerned Aleyd Burral. When his fellow cultists, led by Vorgansharax, launched a coup in the city in 1489 DR, Spernik was freed and became one of the top cultist leaders. Eventually, the Harpers, using Glevith as an intermediary, hired some adventurers in the city to capture or kill him, which they did after a fight."
