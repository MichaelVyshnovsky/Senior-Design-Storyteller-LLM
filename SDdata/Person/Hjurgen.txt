'''Hjurgen''' was one of the second generation of [[frost giant]]s on [[Toril]].

==Relationships==
Hjurgen was a son of [[Ottar]], the father of all frost giants. He had a brother named [[Hrotun]], who was the first of the frost giant [[skald]]s. Hjurgen had a son, [[Hjurnur Wyrmrever|Hjurnur]], who was a great hero.

==History==
Hjurgen was mentioned in the ''[[Saga of the Dragon Queller]]'', an epic ballad about his son Hjurnur Wyrmrever and written by his brother. In that tale, Hjurgen is named as the "leveler of [[Ranauroch]]". (It was not clear to scholars where exactly Ranauroch was located, but many suspected that it was a region of [[Anauroch]].)
