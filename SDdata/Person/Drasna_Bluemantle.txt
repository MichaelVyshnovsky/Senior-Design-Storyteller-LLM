King '''Drasna Bluemantle''', also known as '''Drasna the Fortunate''' was a [[human]] [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] and the ruler of the kingdom of [[Ulgarth]] in [[southeast Faer√ªn]] in the mid-to-late 14th century [[DR]]. He ruled from the city of [[Orvyltar]].

==History==
Although he was the son of the king, Drasna spent his early years as an adventurer. Thanks to his ''luckblade'' and ''stone of good luck'', he was able to win against odds that should have felled him, and slew many monsters. For this, he earned the moniker "the Fortunate".

Settling down, he ascended the throne and was king before [[1367 DR]].

Drasna was still king by [[1373 DR]].

==Personality==
Once he'd become king, Drasna was very serious about his role and dedicated to being a good king. He was a firm believer in no one being denied the king's justice,

==Possessions==
Drasna wielded a ''+1 [[luckblade]] [[broadsword]]'' and carried a ''[[stone of good luck]]'', which both granted him great fortune.

==Base==
As king, Drasna dwelled in the capital city, [[Orvyltar]], where he held extensive estates.

==Activities==
King Drasna toured the realm regularly, visiting each city once a year at least. He also officiated at grand ceremonies where he knighted the worthy. He would give his judgment to any who asked for it. He wished to keep his subjects satisfied with the kingdom's justice system and had no plans to change it.

Drasna maintained his father's non-aggression policy toward [[Durpar]].

Drasna was highly popular with his subjects, who as a result believed completely in the kingdom's feudal system.

==Relationships==
Drasna was apparently good friends with a mage of [[Halruaa]], who enchanted the [[ballista]]e that defended Orvyltar's harbor. The mage expected to receive a gift of several [[jar]]s of [[mingari]] from Drasna on a later visit.
