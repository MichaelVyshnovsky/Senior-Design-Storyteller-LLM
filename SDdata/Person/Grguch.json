        "mainbody": "'''Grguch''' was the powerful [[ogrillon]] chieftain of the much feared [[Clan Karuck]].{{cite book/The Orc King/Hardcover|?}}",
        "History": "Grguch and the powerful Clan Karuck of mighty [[orc]]s and [[ogre]]s emerged from a lesser section of the [[Underdark]] when prompted by three sly orcs to challenge King [[Obould]]. [[Dnark]], the leader of the [[Wolf Jaw]] tribe, [[Toogwik Tuk]], shaman of [[Yellow Fang]], and elder shaman [[Ung-thol]] all deemed [[Obould]]'s complacency on [[Mithral Hall]]'s doorstep to be unsatisfactory to the word of [[Gruumsh]]. Due to his half-orc, half-ogre heritage, Grguch was immensely large and powerful. In fact, the chieftain was one of the few warriors to engage King Obould in battle and seemingly gain the upper hand. After turning his attention from the orc king, Grguch also battled King [[Bruenor]] for a short while, until Obould stepped in and slew the fellow orc.",
        "Equipment": "Grguch was highly adept at throwing huge [[javelin]]s from an [[atlatl]]. He also carried a huge [[greataxe]] named [[Rampant]] that was fashioned in the shape of a [[dragon]]."
