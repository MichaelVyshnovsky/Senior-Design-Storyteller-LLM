        "mainbody": "ivex was a faerie dragon from the Gray Forest and a member of the mixed human and draconic group that defeated Sammaster.\nJivex was skilled in the arts of illusion, preferring to deceive and trick his opponents rather than blast them into little bits and pieces.\nLike all faerie dragons, Jivex was extremely small by dragon standards, no more than the length of a mans arm from snout to tail. His scales had an iridescent hue."
