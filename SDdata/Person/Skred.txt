'''Skred''' was a male [[troglodyte]] [[barbarian]] who roamed the [[Deep Wastes]] on raids for his tribe.

==Description==
Skred wore studded [[leather armor]] and [[gauntlets of ogre power|gauntlets]] on his raids. He typically wrapped himself in a cloak and wielded an over-sized [[morningstar]].

==Personality==
He took great enjoyment in battle, especially close-quarters fighting. Skred's sojourns were often motivated by the allure of acquiring treasure from those he defeated.

==Abilities==
A fine tracker, Skred was an experienced traveler in the [[Underdark]] and was quite good at listening to his quarry's movements. In battle, although not overly strong, he was a furious combatant who wielded an over-sized morningstar with deadly effect. If needed, Skred could shift his attacks to smash an opponent's weapon or intersperse vicious swipes of his claw between his morningstar's blows. Despite his [[barbarian]] rages leaving him heedless to attacks, Skred could rely on his uncanny reflexes and [[troglodyte]] stench to see him through a fight.

==Possessions==
On Skred's hunts, he was well-equipped with a number of [[magic item]]s. He wore ''[[leather armor|studded leather armor]] +2'', a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +2'' and a ''[[ring of protection]] +1'' on his finger. A set of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' helped improve his strength above average for wielding his giant-sized ''[[morningstar]] +2'' more effectively. In battle he would make careful use of his ''[[javelin of lightning]]'' and his [[potion]] of ''[[haste]]''.

==Relationship==
Skred worked ably alongside [[Theod]], a fellow barbarian in their raiding group. Both of them respected the commands of their leader, [[Latar]], and followed his clever battle plans, even if it meant delaying attacks or attacking from range. 

==History==
Hailing from a [[troglodyte]] settlement in the [[Deep Wastes]], Skred became one the most experienced warriors in the raiding group led by [[Latar]], a cleric of [[Laogzed]]. In [[1372 DR]], Skred joined with Latar, [[Theod]], and many other troglodytes to cause mayhem in the tunnels between [[Szith Morcane]] and [[Maerimydra]]. However, after causing much chaos, the group's numbers waned, and they started to become desperate to find some real plunder before returning home.
