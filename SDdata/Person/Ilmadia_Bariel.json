        "mainbody": "Maiden '''Ilmadia Bariel''' was a renegade [[elf]] that devoted herself to the [[Ilmatari]] priest Revered Brother [[Poquelin]] during the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was quite a troubled individual that—despite her cruelty—suffered a tragic end that led to dire consequences across [[Icewind Dale]] for decades to follow.\n\n{{Quote|What am I supposed to do, listen to our elders and watch as the greatest race of Toril drifts into the western sea. To the Abyss with the houses and the Seldarine, for all I care.|Maiden Ilmadia.}}",
        "Personality": "Ilmadia was an arrogant and misanthropic individual. She believed that [[elves]] were the greatest race on all of [[Toril]]. She vehemently disagreed with the idea that elves cede their place of Faerûn to any of the lesser races.<ref group=\"note\">Ilmadia says the line: \"To the Abyss with the retreat...\", referring to the [[Retreat|mass migration]] of elves from Faerûn that begain in [[1344 DR]]. Because the Retreat was initiated some 60 years after the year ''[[Icewind Dale (game)|Icewind Dale]]'' takes place, this is seen as an oversight by designers. Ilmadia's disdain towards others and her frustration with her own people led her to renounced the elven gods of the [[Seldarine]].\n\nIlmadia thought very little of Poquelin's other lieutenants, that [[Marketh]]'s friends were all boorish idiots and that [[Malavon Despana]] had none whatsoever. She held an intense hatred for many people, especially the [[drow]] elves of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Possessions": "Maiden Ilmadia donned the unique [[plate mail]] ''[[Black Swan Armor]]'', and wielded the [[item enchantment|enchanted]] ''[[Argent Shield]]'' and longsword ''[[Alamion]]''. She was also kept the blade known as ''[[Bhaal's Fire]]'', and wore around her neck a special [[magic]]al amulet that hid her \"true nature\" from others.\n\nAfter visiting the Severed Hand, Ilmadia accosted the spirit of [[Custhantos]] and took one of the last remaining copies of ''[[Elameth's Compendium]]'' from the tower's library.",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|Drow always flaunt their resistance to magic. Well, we'll just see how resistant they are to lava and giant, two gundred pound broad swords.|Maiden Ilmadia, regarding the Rilauven drow.}}\n\nMaiden Ilmadia oversaw the operations of the [[fire giant]]s loyal to Poquelin in the lower reaches of [[Dorn's Deep]]. Among her other activities, Ilmadia sought to create [[black unicorn]]s using arcane formulae she recovered from the [[Red Wizard]] [[Saablic Tan]]. She planned to attract a [[unicorn]] from the herd that grazed around the [[Severed Hand]].\n\nHer personal calling was to restore the elven fortress of the Severed Hand, a feat with which she became entirely obsessed.",
        "Relationships": "Ilmadia was true devotee of [[Ilmater]] and wholly dedicated to the cause of Poquelin. She was not at all aware that the Revered Brother was actually the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]].\n\nWhile Ilmadia died a maiden, she was somehow impregnated by the demon Belhifet. After Ilmadia's ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'', she gave birth to twins: the [[half-elf]] [[cambion]]s [[Isair]] and [[Madae]]. While Ilmadia had no relationship with her children, Madae was posthumously named after her late mother by the woman that would raise the twins.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Ilmadia began to carry out a plan that would wipe out the drow of [[Rilauven]] once and for all. Her fire giant subordinates would dismantle the Great Forge of Dorn's Deep and repurpose its components in the construction of an enormous longboat. They would then propel the longboat down the magma flows near Dorn's Deep and break through the cavern wall near Rilauven, flooding the city with molten rock from above.\n\nIlmadia's plan would not come to fruition. That same year she was killed alongside her fire giants by a band of [[adventurer]]s that came to be considered heroes of the [[Ten Towns]].\n\nThe [[1282 DR|following year]], Ilmadia was resurrected by Mother [[Egenia]], a true disciple of the god Ilmater. Upon her return to life, Ilmadia became distraught over her failed dreams to rebuild the Severed Hand, and soon received news that was too much to bear: by some means she was with child. Egenia viewed the pregnancy as a blessing of Ilmater but the truth was far more sinister. Ilmadia gave birth to the two babes, one with a fiendish tail and the other with cloven feet, each sired by the devil Belhifet. Overwhelmed by the trauma she endured, Ilmadia threw herself off a cliff and died for the second and final time."
