        "mainbody": "ihal, sometimes called the Serpent Star, was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace. Unlike normal stars, Nihal didnt have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.\nNihal was a red star,\nNihal, and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, were somehow related to the Eldest.\nNihal writhed around the position it should hold in the sky, and because of that it was called the Serpent Star. Sometimes Nihal sent its agents to Toril, the Serpents of Nihal, to feed on living things so Nihal could sate its hunger. Some scholars believed Nihal was the brother of another elder evil, Kyuss, or even the same being observed from two different points in time.\nNihal was one of the stars the warlock Japheth Donard sought out in 1396 DR, after having lost his pact with the archfey Neifion."
