Cobble was a dwarven cleric in Mithral Hall.
He was a squat and round dwarf with a short yellow beard.
The dwarven cleric was said to be strong in magic and have deep insight into the world.
In 1357 DR, Bruenor Battlehammer gave him the title Holy Cleric of the Hall. 
In 1357 DR, the Companions of the Hall delved deep into Mithral Hall searching for Drizzt DoUrden after Bruenor discovered Artemis Entreri was masquerading as Regis. While hunting for Drizzt, Cobble saw metal shavings on the floor and realized a spell trap. He shouted for the others to fall back but was crushed to death beneath a wall of solid iron cast by Vierna DoUrden.
