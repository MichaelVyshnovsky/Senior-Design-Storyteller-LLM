        "Description": "Like all of her sisters, Kalaeria had long silky brown hair, king the color of [[ivory]], and large cheerful dark eyes. She wore the Dryad's uniform, a sewn leather gown resembling that of an actual [[dryad]], a dress made out of green-dyed [[leather]] leaves.",
        "History": "Kalaeria, [[Braetha Sturnshon|Braetha]], [[Charethra Sturnshon|Charethra]], [[Hestroone Sturnshon|Hestroone]], and her five other sisters all worked at the Dryad's Dreams with their father. The women were in charge of serving food and drinks to the customers and entertained them, giving rubdown to sore muscles of foresters and rangers at the end of a long workday. The women greeted the clients with cheery attitudes and affectionate body language. On occasion, they perform a limited assortment of medical procedures, such as setting dislocated joints or fingers in for the locals."
