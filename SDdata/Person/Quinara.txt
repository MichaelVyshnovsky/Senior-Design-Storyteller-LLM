{{Quote|''Iain't looking to make friends - or enemies. Go bother someone else.''|Quinara.}}

==Description==
Quinara was a crimson-skinned [[tiefling]] with [[Asmodeus]]'s blood. She had long twisted horns and burning orange eyes. Quinara's hair was purple and her right eye was crossed by a scar. She had a direct and no-nonsense personality.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Quinara was a member of an adventuring band that included the [[gnome]] [[Yonks]], the [[elf]] [[Sarafin]], and [[Zog]] the [[half-orc]]. The group traveled the Sword Coast in search of steady adventuring work. They traveled from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute crisis]] and, unable to find work, planned to move out to [[Neverwinter]] as the city was searching for adventures. Before they could move on, Quinara sought to sharpen all of her blades and pack her bags.
