Kruts Marpin was a human inhabitant of Eveningstar during the late 15 century DR.
Kruts had tanned skin, and kept a small black moustache and a shaved head.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Kruts could be seen fishing on the Starwater River. He seemed relatively unconcerned with the ongoing drow aggression against his town.
