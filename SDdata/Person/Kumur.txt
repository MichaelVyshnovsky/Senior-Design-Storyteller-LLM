'''Kumur the Skeptic''' was a [[sage]] and the First Speaker of Evernoster. Kumur was considered the most critical of his profession, as his nickname attested.{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}

==History==
At some point prior to the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Kumur the Skeptic undertook a study of history and legendry surrounding the [[enchanted]] sword ''[[Namarra]]'', and could not even estimate a likely period or locale for its origin, nor uncover any stories alluding to a time "before Namarra was forged".
