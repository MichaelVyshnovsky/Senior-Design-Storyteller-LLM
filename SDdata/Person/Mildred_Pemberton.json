        "mainbody": "ady Mildred Pemberton and her husband Lord Harrold Pemberton were a part of the Pembertons of Highcastle noble family in the late 14 century DR.\nLady Pemberton was an older woman with grey hair who smelled of expensive perfume, excessively so.\nMildred Pemberton just like her husband was self involved who often talked over and got into arguments with Lord Pemberton, often ignoring everyone and everything around her. She could not stand her husbands sarcasm be it real or perceived. She never missed an opportunity to remind her husband that his family was not from Highcastle, unlike hers.\nIn 1372 DR, both Lord and Lady Pemberton could be found in the Chateau Elite during their visit to Daggerford."
