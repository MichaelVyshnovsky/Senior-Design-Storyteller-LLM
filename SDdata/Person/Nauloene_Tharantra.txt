'''Nauloene Tharantra''' was a notorious hedonist and businesswoman living in [[Waterdeep]] in the latter half of the [[:Category:14th century|14th century DR]].{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Tharantra Husband-Hunting Again}}

==Description==
Judging by her nickname and her profession, she was probably a redhead who honored [[Sune]], but this is uncertain.{{Speculation}} She lived on [[Sevenlamps Cut]] in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep]]. Her last known public appearance was sometime around the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], when she stood on the stage of the [[Splendid Falcon]] theater and dancehall (also in the Castle Ward) and announced that she was looking to marry again, stating she felt sufficient time had passed since enduring her last husband's cruel nature. She wore a sparkling [[gown]] made of chains in a crisscross pattern adorned with blue [[diamond]] teardrop pendants dangling from various locations.

==Personality==
She was a lady of pleasure, known to be free-loving and free-spending.

==Activities==
For many years, Nauloene was the manager and hostess of the [[Heartflame]] festhall on [[Snail Street]] in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]] until it burned down on the [[Night of Pirates]] in [[Uktar]], the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]].

==History==
Nauloene was married nine times before her announcement on the stage of the Splendid Falcon theater. Five of her husbands died; two fled Waterdeep citing personality and lifestyle conflicts; one was exposed as a [[doppelganger]] and killed in the streets of Waterdeep; and the ninth husband, merchant [[Mharelk Thorlkan]] from [[Innarlith]], she threw out and paid to have the marriage dissolved.

==Rumors and legends==
The rumors in Waterdeep were that Nauloene had a hand in the death of at least two of her husbands.
