        "Activities": "Rennyn was one of the most talented spies of Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]]. Often he went on missions to [[Faer√ªn]] and he usually disguised himself as a conjurer, a minstrel, or another kind of entertainer. Thanks to his [[magic]], he could appear with a different face each time.",
        "Personality": "For a mission's success, Rennyn was very able at faking friendship or interest to get familiar with someone. However, in truth, he had a frosty personality, being very insular and distant from others.",
