Kethin Zurn was an older alchemist who lived in the city of Proskur during the 14 century DR. He ran a shop called Zurns Elixirs, located within the Stronghouse in the citys Thayan enclave. He provided arcane components and reagents to the local Red Wizards and magica spellcasters of Proskur.
Zurn was an eccentric older man with a very distinct appearance. He had unique tattoos of a mustache and beard, with one eye that was near-completely clouded over with a cataract.
He was a well-educated man with a vast knowledge of herbalism, alchemy, and arcana, as well as Thayan history and lore. He had some odd behaviors such as rarely speaking to the employees within his shop when he was giving them orders and not allowing them to discuss matters with customers.
The elder merchant was the uncle of the enclaves khazark, Chathin Zurn. As such, all the Red Wizards and staff of the enclave treated Kethin with respect, despite his seemingly odd behavior and eccentricities.
