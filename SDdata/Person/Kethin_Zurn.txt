'''Kethin Zurn''' was an older alchemist who lived in the city of [[Proskur]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He ran a shop called [[Zurn's Elixirs]], located within the [[Stronghouse]] in the city's [[Thay]]an [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]]. He provided arcane components and reagents to the local Red Wizards and [[magic]]a [[spellcaster]]s of Proskur.

==Description==
Zurn was an eccentric older man with a very distinct appearance. He had unique tattoos of a mustache and beard, with one eye that was near-completely clouded over with a cataract.

He was a well-educated man with a vast knowledge of herbalism, alchemy, and arcana, as well as Thayan history and lore. He had some odd behaviors such as rarely speaking to the employees within his shop when he was giving them orders and not allowing them to discuss matters with customers.

==Relationships==
The elder merchant was the uncle of the enclave's [[khazark]], [[Chathin Zurn]]. As such, all the Red Wizards and staff of the enclave treated Kethin with respect, despite his seemingly odd behavior and eccentricities.
