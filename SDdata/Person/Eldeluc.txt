'''Eldeluc''' ({{Pronounce|EL|de|luke|refs= 

==Description==
He was large, burly, and fat, and quite strong for a mage.

==Personality==
With a friendly and jovial manner, Eldeluc seemed like a big fun guy, but this hid a deeply evil man with a tainted soul.

==Relationships==
Because of his worship of [[Bane]], Eldeluc had acquired connections with the [[Zhentarim]], 

==History==
Originally, Eldeluc was Dendybar's apprentice, and, perhaps surprisingly for the Arcane Brotherhood, was utterly loyal to his master.

Eldeluc conspired with Dendybar the Mottled and other associates to have their rival [[Morkai the Red]], the Master of the North Tower, murdered by his apprentice [[Akar Kessel]] at their command while on an expedition to [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}.

His removal saw both Eldeluc and Dendybar rise to key places in the Brotherhood But Eldeluc's apparently easier rise through the lower ranks made Dendybar jealous and resentful. No longer loyal to his old master, Eldeluc watched his back while pitying Dendybar's new apprentice [[Sydney]]. It did not seem long until one got rid of the other.

Fortunately for Eldeluc, their rivalry ended when Dendybar did, when he was slain by the vengeful spirit of Morkai the Red in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}. Eldeluc, meanwhile, apparently escaped or avoided retribution, at least so far. 

Eventually, some time after [[1367 DR]], Eldeluc and fellow lieutenant [[Valkebar]] assassinated [[Queltar Thaeloon]], the Wizard of Green Fire and the chief lieutenant of Arklem Greeth. The pair then targeted Arklem himself, ambushing him in his bedchamber at night on [[Eleint 14]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. Protected by his magic, but badly wounded, Arklem fled the Host Tower.

By the time Arklem returned, as a [[lich]] allied with [[devil]], the Arcane Brotherhood was leaderless and in civil war and the Host Tower half empty. Arklem killed Eldeluc and Valkebar and regained control of the Arcane Brotherhood. However, it was suspected that Eldeluc probably kept a hidden clone of himself.
