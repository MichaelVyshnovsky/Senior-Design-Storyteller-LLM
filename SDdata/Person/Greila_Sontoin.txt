'''Greila Sontoin''' was a High Priestess of [[Mystra]] in the [[High Temple of Mystra|temple]] on [[Mount Talath]] in [[Halruaa]].

==Personality==
Greila was granted supernatural wisdom by Mystra.

==Activities==
Because of her age and many duties regarding the temple, Greila seldom left the security of Mount Talath. However, even as late as [[1373 DR]], she was still considered powerful enough to pose a threat to [[Zalathorm Kirkson]]. Thankfully, the two were cordial with each other and remained in close contact.
