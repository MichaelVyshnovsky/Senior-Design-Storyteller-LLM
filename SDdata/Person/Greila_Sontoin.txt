Greila Sontoin was a High Priestess of Mystra in the temple on Mount Talath in Halruaa.
Greila was granted supernatural wisdom by Mystra.
Because of her age and many duties regarding the temple, Greila seldom left the security of Mount Talath. However, even as late as 1373 DR, she was still considered powerful enough to pose a threat to Zalathorm Kirkson. Thankfully, the two were cordial with each other and remained in close contact.
