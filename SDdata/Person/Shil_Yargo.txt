'''Shil Yargo''' was the head of [[Company Yargo]], a mercenary outfit that operated out of the [[skyship]] ''[[Buccaneer's Tear]]'' during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was a confident nearly to the point of arrogance, leading her crew with bold actions that could lead to big payoffs.

==Activities==
Shil and her crew have been accused of acts of piracy, though never brought up on any official charges.

==Possessions==
When leaping into battle, Shil wielded two long, narrow-bladed [[dagger]]s. She typically wore a [[tricorn]] hat.

==Relationships==
She along with other [[halfling]]s in her family, were said to be descended from the famous Pirate King [[King Yargo|Yargo]] of [[Yaulazna]],

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Shil and her crew took the ''Buccaneer's Tear'' over to the city of [[Neverwinter]] to investigate strange goings-on at the [[earthmote]] known as [[Pirates' Skyhold]] floating above the city. While they originally made an effort to recover some wreckage from the crashed skyship ''[[Magister's Hope]]'', the company's forward scouts and their [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventurer ally]] came across a group of mutineers from the vessel helmed by Captain [[Kayliss]], second-in-command to the legendary undead pirate king, [[Bartholomew Blackdagger]].

The adventurer managed to work with one of the disaffected pirates, [[Norver|Norver the Cook]], and infiltrate Kayliss' [[Scoundrel's Retreat|hideaway lair]]. After destroying the [[undead]] former first mate, Shil and Company Yargo acquired the surviving skyship to expand what would hopefully become a growing fleet for the up-and-coming mercenary company.
