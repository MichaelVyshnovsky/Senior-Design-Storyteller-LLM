Shil and her crew have been accused of acts of piracy, though never brought up on any official charges.
When leaping into battle, Shil wielded two long, narrow-bladed daggers. She typically wore a tricorn hat.
She along with other halflings in her family, were said to be descended from the famous Pirate King Yargo of Yaulazna,
In the , Shil and her crew took the Buccaneers Tear over to the city of Neverwinter to investigate strange goings-on at the earthmote known as Pirates Skyhold floating above the city. While they originally made an effort to recover some wreckage from the crashed skyship Magisters Hope, the companys forward scouts and their adventurer ally came across a group of mutineers from the vessel helmed by Captain Kayliss, second-in-command to the legendary undead pirate king, Bartholomew Blackdagger.
The adventurer managed to work with one of the disaffected pirates, Norver the Cook, and infiltrate Kayliss hideaway lair. After destroying the undead former first mate, Shil and Company Yargo acquired the surviving skyship to expand what would hopefully become a growing fleet for the up-and-coming mercenary company.
