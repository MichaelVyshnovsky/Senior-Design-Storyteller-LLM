        "mainbody": "'''Arglath''' was a massive [[elder orb]] [[beholder]] from [[Ooltul]], presumed to be alive in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Arglath was a beholder of monstrous size from Ooltul, and one of the mightiest beholders to escape the city's destruction.\n\nAt one point, it tried to conquer the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]] but was destroyed by [[Elminster Aumar]]. Afterward, from time to time, Elminster disguised himself as Arglath, aided by the fact that nobody else knew of the death of the elder orb. In that role, Elminster foiled [[Manshoon]]'s plot to take over [[Zhentil Keep]] and received in exchange a list of [[true name]]s of powerful beings, including the [[phaerimm]] [[Triumvirate]] ruling Ooltul."
