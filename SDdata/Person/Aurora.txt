Aurora () was the owner of Auroras Emporium in 1370 DR.
Aurora had a daughter Lemily who carried on the familys business but struggled due to circumstances beyond her control. Auroras granddaughter Leleanor proved to be a cunning businesswoman and daring adventurer in her own right.
Aurora was an adventurer sorceress who traveled most of Faer√ªn, from Icewind Dale to Chult, from the Sword Coast to the fringes of Kara-Tur. During her travels, she became fascinated by the differences in culture between far-away places. Once settled in Waterdeep, Aurora decided to open a business that could entertain her sense of exploration. In time, Auroras business increased to a very high level, with agents in many places. Usually, Aurora managed the shop in Waterdeep with only an assistant.
