        "mainbody": "Musharib () was a Chultan dwarf working as a guide out of Port Nyanzaru in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR.\nMusharib worked as a guide, but was really seeking adventurers to aid him in reclaiming his ancestral forge of Hrakhamar from a group of firenewts. He also sought to retrieve the dwarven relic Moradins Gauntlet from the armory of Hrakhamar.\nIf Musharib encountered any dwarven adventurers, he would appeal to their dwarf pride to help him in his quest."
