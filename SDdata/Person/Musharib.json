        "Activities": "Musharib worked as a guide, but was really seeking adventurers to aid him in reclaiming his ancestral forge of [[Hrakhamar]] from a group of [[firenewt]]s. He also sought to retrieve the [[dwarven]] relic ''[[Moradin's Gauntlet]]'' from the armory of Hrakhamar.",
        "Personality": "If Musharib encountered any dwarven adventurers, he would appeal to their dwarf pride to help him in his quest."
