'''Koz''' was a [[Neverwinter|Neverwintan]] soldier stationed in the [[Leilon]] garrison in the [[High Tower of Thalivar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When Leilon was resettled in the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Dagult Neverember]] sent some of Neverwinter's soldiers to defend the settlers during the town's reconstruction. Koz was among these soldiers, serving under Sergeant [[Hazz Yorrum]]'s command. The High Tower of Thalivar acted as a garrison for the soldiers. However, it turned out that the wizard tower was haunted by the [[ghost]] of [[Thalivar]]. The wizard's spirit drove away Koz, Yorrum and two other soldiers ([[Gori]] and [[Erlum]]). However, the town mage [[Gallio Elibro]] refused to leave. The soldiers had recently noticed Gallio's odd behavior but they were unaware that Thalivar's ghost took possession of the mage every night. A group of [[adventurers]] took care of the ghost.
