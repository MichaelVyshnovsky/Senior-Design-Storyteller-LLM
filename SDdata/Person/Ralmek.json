        "mainbody": "'''Ralmek''' was the stable-master for the [[Thay]]an [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]] within the city of [[Proskur]] around [[1372 DR]]. It was his duty to maintain the stable's stock of supplies and [[horse]]s, for the enclave's high-ranking [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]]. He was assisted in his duties by a few stable boys, who maintained diligent cleanliness within the stable's pens.\n\nAs a mid-level employee of the enclave, Ralmek was also a member of [[Guild of Foreign Trade]].",
        "History": "At some point, [[khazark]] [[Chathin Zurn]] informed Ralmek that if the smell from the stables ever became too intense within the enclave she would have him shipped back to Thay as a slave."
