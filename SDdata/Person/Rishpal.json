        "mainbody": "Rishpal was a Zhentarim fighter and spy that followed General Vaalgamon.\nThe fighter was muscled, and wore banded mail and a metal helmet. Rishpal fought with a longsword and shield. His hometown was Llorkh, and he knew the town very well.\nCirca 1358 DR, the Zhentarim general, Vaalgamon launched an assault against the future Heroes of Ascore, who had been a consistent pain in his side. Rishpal was part of Vaalgamons contingent in Loudwater, and surrendered after the fight. He explained that his lord had left his soldiers to die whilst he escaped the commotion.\nRishpal wished to join with the heroes, and tried to convince them by telling them he wanted revenge, and where they could complete their mission. He told the heroes that the aim of his contingent was to stop them getting to Llorkh. However, Rishpal was actually a spy, and would not follow them if they continued to go past Llorkh."
