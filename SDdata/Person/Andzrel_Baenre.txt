'''Andzrel Baenre''' was the weapons master of [[House Baenre]] and a commander of the [[Army of the Black Spider]].

==Description==
Andzrel wore black [[mithral]] plate and a dark cloak. He was tall and disciplined. 

He was the son of one of [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s cousins, a thus a noble, but not a very high one.

== History ==
===Background===
Andzrel was once ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into a riding lizard by [[Nauzhror Baenre]] and promptly bit him in the buttocks. Since then their relationship was somewhat strained.

===[[War of the Spider Queen]]===
When [[Triel Baenre]] ordered the formation of the [[Army of the Black Spider]] in [[1372 DR]], she placed Andzrel as its commander. Although Andzrel was very capable, [[Nimor Imphraezl]] (disguised as Captain Zhayemd of [[House Agrach Dyrr]]) was able to charm Andzrel into taking his misleading advice.

Forming a decisive plan against the armies of [[Gracklstugh]], Andzrel led the drow to the defense of the [[Pillars of Woe]], where the army was betrayed by the plans of Nimor. He tasted his first defeat there both as a commander and as a warrior when he faced [[Nimor Imphraezl]] in personal combat (although Nimor was defeated with magical aid, but was nonetheless able to escape via his [[ring of shadow]]).

Sometime later, [[Gromph Baenre]] and Andzrel disguised themselves as [[tanarukk]]s and entered the enemy camp. Gromph attached a light gem to Nimor to prevent him shadow-walking. However, in the process, Gromph himself was blinded.

===Post-[[Spellplague]]===
In [[1463 DR]], Andzrel was still serving as House Baenre's weapons master, with [[Tiago Baenre]] serving as his first assistant until he left for [[Gauntlgrym]].

* ''[[Extinction]]'' (minor)
