Kassandre Malari was an adventurer in Cormyr with the Warhawks company in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
In 1368 DR and 1369 DR, she and Bartek Alforael attended parties at Thistleflame Keep, held by Lord Partic Thistle for King Azoun IVs birthday. They were interviewed as suspects after Lord Thistle appeared to be murdered at the latter party, but proved to be uninvolved with the plot.
