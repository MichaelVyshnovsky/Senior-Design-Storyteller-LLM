        "Personailty": "The Ooze Master believed that all [[Red Wizards]] needed to be fused with oozes in order to achieve immortality and it welcomed all that arrived in its presence as new apprentices that needed its gift.",
        "Abilities": "It was similar to a [[lich]] as, after it was destroyed, it reappeared asleep in the nearby Red Pillar, and it could only truly be slain with the destruction of the [[Phylactery Vault]]. If a person was killed by fluids secreted by the Red Pillar, then the Ooze Master gained the knowledge and memories of the dead. It was linked to the [[White Maw]] and knewn if it was slain.",
        "History": "The Ooze Master was the result of one of the experiments of the [[transmuter]] [[Sarkalla]] to create a sentient ooze. It had once been a Red Wizard that Sarkalla successfully fused with an ooze. It became a powerful creature but was not the perfect assassin that Sarkalla had sought.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "In [[1486 DR]], it was destroyed by the heroes of [[Daggerford]]."
