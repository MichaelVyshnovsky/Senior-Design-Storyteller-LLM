Redshadow was a legendary female dragon disciple who lived and died many years before the late 14 century DR.
Redshadows legend was born after she slew a great wyrm in an epic battle in the skies over what then was called Dragonsfire Mountains. Some claimed that the dragon disciple was, in fact, the slain dragons child. She used the creatures hide to stitch together a set of bulky enchanted great wyrm gauntlets. Redshadow continued to wear these gauntlets until her own death, many years later.
