Bruk was a human invocation wizard and adventurer of the Puppetmasters company in 1369 DR.
Bruk considered himself superior to others by virtue of his Zhentish heritage, and regarded everyone around himself with a measure of contempt. Despite his poor personality, he was actually quite clever and intelligent.
Bruk wielded a staff of striking and a wand of fire. He defended himself with a +4 cloak of protection, a ring of mind shielding, and bracers of defense.
Bruk specialized in invocation, and as such had learned many destructive blasting spells alongside his more typical arcane repertoire. His more powerful spells included fireball, lightning bolt, ice storm, and shout.
Bruk was a mage of Zhentil Keep who fled when it was razed in early 1369 DR, then joined the Puppetmasters.
Later that year, the Puppetmasters came up with a scheme to win an easy prize for the company. They planted a letter and treasure map leading to the dungeon of Barrenstone, allowing another adventuring group to excavate and clear out the complex. When they emerged from the dungeon with the treasure, the Puppetmasters attempted to rob their victims, only to be driven off and receive nothing for their troubles.
