'''Lord Krell Huntcrown''' was the head of the noble [[Huntcrown]] family of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Lord Krell was a short-tempered man, and opposed the acceptance of [[adventurer|adventuring]] companies in Cormyr, and conspired to discredit them. He was a known schemer in high-society.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Lord Krell attended King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday feast, hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]]. He was accompanied there by Lady [[Ohrmatha Huntcrown]]. He used the opportunity to have a spy poke around the Manor and look for an embarrassing scandal that could be used against Lord Thistle, the Registrant General of Cormyr.
