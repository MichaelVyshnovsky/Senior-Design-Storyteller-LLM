        "mainbody": "'''Uzzak-Szalzik''' was the [[shaman]] of Chieftain [[Saslick]]'s [[lizardfolk]] tribe who resided in the [[Lizard Marsh]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Uzzak-Szalzik was an old and wrinkled lizardman.",
        "Abilities": "The lizardman was a powerful shaman who brewed ''[[potion of frenzy|potions of frenzy]]'' and knew how to craft ''[[effigies]]'' of creatures allowing Uzzak to curse them with afflictions and even cause death.",
        "Possessions": "Uzzak-Szalzik wore [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[hide armor]], carried a large magical ''+1'' wooden [[shield]], and was armed with an enchanted ''+1'' [[club]]. He kept a ''[[potion of speed]]'' on his person to use in case of trouble.\n\nThe shaman craved a magical ''[[Uzzak-Szalzik's knife|knife]]'' in the likeness of the [[black dragon]] [[Thuraskulusk]] his tribe worshiped as a god. He expressed devotion to the pseudo-deity by affixing his own tooth onto the enchanted knife's [[leather]] handle.",
        "History": "Sometime before 1372 DR, Uzzak-Szalzik and Saslick pledged allegiance to the ancient dragon Thuraskulusk, who protected the tribe from invading outsiders and the opposing lizardfolk under [[Redeye]]. Uzzak worshiped the wyrm as a god, while the tribe erected a statue to the dragon at the village's center to be used as a temple. Sometime along the way, the shaman started feuding with an old [[hag]] who lived across the swamp from Saslick's tribe. One day, the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] was away from her den picking ripe ''[[stinkberries]]''. The shaman sent his servant to steal the hag's hairbrush, which was soon used to craft an ''effigy'' of the old witch. Using the poppet, Uzzak-Szalzik started toying with his adversary, sending small curses her way, including covering the Green Hag's skin with red rashes of [[fire ant]]s' bites. The witch attempted to retrieve the ''effigy'' via an army of swamp [[toad]]s but lizardfolk fried up the beasts and used them as snacks.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Redeye and the Green Hag sent the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to infiltrate Saslick's tribe in a magical guise as a fellow lizardfolk. The Hero stashed one of Thuraskulusk's stolen eggs in Chieftain Saslick's hut, enraging the tribe's protector. While there, the Hero also stole the hag's ''effigy'', her precious hair comb, and ''Uzzak-Szalzik's knife''. The hag was delighted to have avoided death via a magical poppet and created an ''effigy'' of Uzzak-Szalzik using the lizard shaman's tooth from the knife's handle. The hag placed an ironic curse on the dragon-loving shaman, cursing him with a nasty case of [[dragon lice]]. Her vengeance was to be slow and deadly."
