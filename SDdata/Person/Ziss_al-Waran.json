        "mainbody": "'''Ziss al-Waran''', or '''Ziss the Lizard''', was a [[lizardfolk]] merchant living in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "Green scales covered Ziss' skin. She tattooed herself with several geometric patterns.",
        "Activities": "Ziss specialized in the sale of trained [[monkey]]s. She cared deeply for the animals and refused to sell them to anyone known to mistreat animals. She would even refuse to sell one of her monkeys to anyone who had recently purchased one, believing that these people were only using her animals to trigger traps while adventuring.\n\nThough she maintained a stall in the [[Grand Bazaar]], Ziss often roamed the city with a dozen of her monkeys on leashes, luring potential customers with their tricks.\n\nZiss' monkeys were very well-trained. They were capable of obeying an impressive number of commands and, for an additional fee, could even be trained in more elicit ventures such as pick-pocketing.",
        "History": "Ziss first came to Huzuz in [[1347 DR]] via a [[spelljammer|spelljamming]] vessel with some other lizardfolk.",
        "Relationships": "Ziss had two sonsâ€”[[Zina]] and [[Kreel]]."
