        "mainbody": "'''Yantha Coaxrock''' was the leader of of the [[Stoneheart Enclave]] in [[Blingdenstone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Yantha was a young wizard who became the leader of the Stoneheart Enclave in Blingdenstone. She split her time and energy between conducting magical research in her city, helping the [[svirfneblin]] enclave in Mantol—Derith, and working with the rest of the Stoneheart Enclave.\n\nYantha was in Mantol-Derith, where the [[duergar]] merchant [[Krimgol Muzgardt]] hired her to set a gem in an item of jewelry. However, the gem was in fact a magical gem that caused madness—the work of the [[demon lord]] [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]—and Yantha succumbed to the gem's influence and lied to Krimgol about its value. Suspecting treachery, the duergar demanded the gem back, but it was secretly stolen by [[Flink Thunderbonk]], Yantha's apprentice. Krimgol did not believe Yantha's story and, with the support of [[Ghuldur Flagonfist]], the duergar representative, attacked the deep gnome section of the city and kidnapped the wizard, starting a civil war in the trading post.\n\nGhuldur and Krimgol than interrogated Yantha in order to understand the whole matter.",
        "Personality": "The [[demon lord]]'s madness caused Yantha to always tell others elaborate lies instead of the truth, for no reason.",
        "Relationships": "Yantha had a trusted apprentice, Flink Thunderbonk. She also was on good terms with [[Nomi Pathshutter]], her second-in-command at the Enclave."
