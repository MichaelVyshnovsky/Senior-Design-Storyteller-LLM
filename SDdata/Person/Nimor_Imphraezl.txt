'''Nimor Imphraezl''' was a talented and deadly [[zekyl]] [[assassin]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the post-[[Spellplague]] era, Nimor became the patron of a Jaezred Chaulssin fosterage in [[Menzoberranzan]] under the guise of '''Nagyon Nurindyn''', a member of House [[Nurindyn]].

==Description==
Nimor often appeared as a youthful drow male. He was physically very strong, much stronger than a normal drow.

He was a member of the Jaezred Chaulssin, a group of assassins who dreamed of casting down Lolth's unholy hierarchy in every drow city in the [[Underdark]] and becoming the secret guiding force in rebuilding a new society and then its ruling power.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}

==Abilities==
Thanks to his [[half-dragon|draconic]] heritage, Nimor was much stronger than other drow and had perfected many dark spells of the [[assassin]]'s lethal profession.

==History==
===Background===
Nimor was not raised in [[Chaulssin]], as it was considered too dangerous for the young. To counteract this danger, the leadership of the Jaezred Chaulssin decided to create fosterages, bases of operation that doubled as places to raise their children.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|3}} With him being a half–shadow dragon of the family, Imphraezl made him the son of [[Ilphtrin Imphraezl]], the Patron Father of [[Sschindylryn]], creating the suspicion that he was raised in Sschindylryn.{{Speculation}}

In the Jaezred Chaulssin, rising in rank was done by defeating a superior, and Nimor got his position as the Anointed Blade by murdering his chief rival, [[Antrysn Barriath]], who was subsequently raised from the dead.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}} Nimor held this position by the time of the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]].

===The War of the Spider Queen===
During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, the Jaezred Chaulssin seized the chance to take over a number of weakened [[Lolth]]ite cities. Nimor was assigned to [[Menzoberranzan]]. He helped instigate a slave revolt in the city (led by the [[alhoon]] [[Syrzan]]) in order to both weaken the city and take power over it.

Soon after, Nimor solidified his support from Crown Prince [[Horgar Steelshadow]] of [[Gracklstugh]] (by bringing down his father, the king) and the [[Dyrr|Lichdrow Dyrr]] and [[Matron Mother]] [[Yasraena Dyrr]] of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] (by killing the matron of the house's rival, [[House Faen Tlabbar]]).). The [[duergar]] army, with assistance from Nimor, who brought in [[Kaanyr Vhok]] to aid their cause and who was able to infiltrate the city's ranks as "Captain Zhayemed of Agrach Dyrr", attacked and defeated the Menzoberranyr army at the [[Pillars of Woe]]. The combined forces subsequently besieged Menzoberranzan for a number of months.

However, before the siege was successful, Lolth returned as the Silence of Lolth was ended. The priestesses of Menzoberranzan regained their powers and were able to turn aside their besiegers. Nimor returned to the Jaezred Chaulssin in failure and was demoted from his position as the Anointed Blade.

===Infiltration of Menzoberranzan===
Since his failure to overthrow Menzoberranzan, Nimor worked carefully to reacquire his former position. To this end, Nimor adopted the guise of a minor noble called Nagyon Nurindyn and even managed to help establish a fosterage in Menzoberranzan by using [[House Nurindyn]] as their front. By [[1479 DR]], Nimor was the patron of this fosterage and directing his assassins.

Nimor chose [[Arach-Tinilith]], the priestess school that doubled as the theological center of Menzoberranzan, as his target. In [[1469 DR]], he managed to infiltrate the graduation ceremony of the newly ordained and caused carnage by intentionally disrupting a ritual, resulting in a rampaging [[demon]] horde that caused not only heavy material damage to the temple but also mortal casualties.

==Activities==
Undercover as a patron of the Menzoberranzan fosterage around 1479 DR, his ultimate goal was to incite rebellion against the matriarchy and thus Lolth. To this end, he ordered his followers to spread, especially to the male populace, who were by divine mandate chronically maltreated, the idea to rebel against Lolth's priestesses and by extension their goddess. Another operation under his guidance was infiltration. He succeeded in so far that opposition groups in the male-dominated warrior and mage schools, [[Melee-Magthere]] and [[Sorcere]], started to organize with his people among them. He also ordered his [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] and [[half-drow]] members to sell themselves into slavery to noble houses to become favored slaves and suggest an alliance with House Nurindyn, his front, in order to make it easier to spy on them while at the same time creating discord in the infiltrated houses. All this was done to create at every social layer of the city a climate of dissatisfaction directed at its rulers under Lolth to cause rebellion.

Despite his terrorist activities, ranging from rabble-rousing to assassination up to the carnage mentioned above, Lolth's clergy was incapable discerning the hand of the Jaezred Chaulssin in these events on any meaningful level.

==Relationship==
Apparently, he commanded a 140 members strong force of the Jaezred Chaulssin in [[Menzoberranzan]].

His most important rivalry was with [[Antrysn Barriath]], as mentioned above, he killed him once for his position. After his resurrection in [[1372 DR]], Antrysn retook his old position.

==Abilities==
Nimor was a ''[[zekyl]]'' and had all the abilities of one and was an assassin of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]. The assassins’ guild’s members all had some training in either as a [[sorcerer]], [[rogue]] or [[assassin]]. Nimor received training as a rogue, an assassin and as a fighter. 
He was extremely skilled in the traditional assassination skills of the roguish quality of trying to kill his target with the first strike or through the usage of poison, to which he was conditioned against, and received further specific training of the Jaezred Chaulssin to augment the lethality of his killing strike. His hiding skill was such, that he could simply hide away no matter whether people were watching him or not. 
As a fighter, he was trained to fight with one weapon in each hand, a rapier, for which he gained even more training, and a dagger each hand.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|7}}

Over the course of his career as an assassin, Nimor learnt to cast a number of spells. Naturally, he learnt a number of spells, that were useful to his profession as an assassin. He was capable to counter [[divination]] spell by either diverting them to a wrong target with ''[[misdirection]]'' or remain simply undetected with ''[[nondetection]]''. He could fool others’ senses, with ''[[ghost sound]]'' hearing, vision with either shutting them out with ''[[obscuring mist]]'' or ''[[darkness]]'' or becoming invisible via ''[[invisibility]]'' or ''[[greater invisibility]]'' and smell via ''[[pass without trace]]''. He could protect him against being trapped via ''[[freedom of movement]]'' or against general damage with ''[[false life]]''. He could also cast ''[[poison]]'' and ''[[true strike]]'' to make attacks more accurate.

==Possessions==
Nimor owned a large number of magic items that helped him at his profession. He owned an ''[[assassin's dagger]]'' to increase the lethality of his killing strike of an [[assassin]] and a green black steel ''[[rapier of puncturing]]'', that sapped with its vitality of the enemy, dropping that enemy’s resilience to withstand his killing blows.

He wore a magical [[mithral]] chainshirt, that wasn’t only enchanted to better protect him but also to increase his hiding and sneaking skills, the former was helped with a ''greater [[piwafwi]]’’, that also gave him minor protection against fire, and the latter through a pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''.''

His ''[[drow house insignia]]'' held the spell ''[[ebon eyes]]'', to see through ''[[darkness]]'' spells.His most interesting item was a ''[[ring of shadows]]''. It was an ebony band, that worked as a ''[[ring of see invisibility]]'' for normal people, while under the usage of an assassin such as Nimor, it allowed him to cast both ''[[etheral jaunt]]'' and ''[[shadow walk]]''.
