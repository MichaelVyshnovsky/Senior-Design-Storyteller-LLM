        "History": "Together, they took in [[Marrec]] as an infant, though they had many children of their own, including [[Emmon]], and they nursed the young boy back to health. They were not able to find out who his parents were. They frowned on him taking any pet more dangerous than a hare. When Emmon was injured while on a trek through the wilderness with an eleven-year old Marrec, they punished both children. They were both supportive of Marrec's decision to join the village militia at the age of sixteen, seeing him as a natural for combat.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|24-26|3}}\n\nHowever, when Emmon was killed in the militia, and Marrec came into his [[medusa]] heritage, they wanted nothing more to do with him.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|40|4}}"
