'''Eldoth Kron''' was an unscrupulous [[bard]]<ref group="note">In the ''[[Baldur's Gate (comic)|Baldur's Gate comic]]'', Ajantis refers to Eldoth as a [[mage]]. It is unknown if this is an error or a change of profession. who traveled throughout the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"There is no good or evil, only the charming and the tedious."''|Eldoth}}

==Personality==
He was a sleazy and chauvinistic dilettante who made a living seducing rich women and living off their money.

==Abilities==
Eldoth was rather adept at crafting [[poison]]-tipped arrows that were too dangerous for others to properly handle.

==Relationships==
While he did not seem to truly care for her, Eldoth enjoyed a romantic relationship with the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|noblewoman]] [[Skie Silvershield]]. She truly loved him despite the absence of mutual respect and adoration.

==History==
Eldoth was originally from the realm of [[Ruathym]]. He left the isle as a teenager to study at the academy of [[New Olamn]] in [[Waterdeep]]. At some point in his youth he became quite skilled in the use of poison.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, he formulated a scheme that involved his lover Skie. He was to elope with her, and blackmail her father by claiming she was "kidnapped" and threatening her with harm if he was not paid on a regular basis.

Eldoth Kron was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]] of Baldur's Gate, next to the [[Grand Mausoleum]]. His gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Eldoth Kron - Raise a glass to the poor bastard." His grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body raised as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a [[gift]], who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.The comic "Baldur's Gate", released in 1998, presents a series of events incongruent with those in the game series. Some time that year or next, he formed a plot with the misandrist warrior [[Shar-Teel Dosan]]. The two were to work with a few other adventurers escorting a bride-to-be and her dowry south from the Sword Coast to the nation of [[Amn]]. Among this group were the [[paladin]] of [[Helm]], [[Ajantis Ilvastarr]], the [[ranger]] [[Kivan]], and the megalomaniacal [[priest]] [[Tiax]]. After their caravan was ambushed by [[hobgoblin]]s and [[ogre]]s, Eldoth stole the dowry and retreated to the [[Undercellar]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Ajantis survived the assault and briefly partnered with Shar-Teel to recover the stolen riches. Unfortunately for him, he was double-crossed by Shar-Teel and killed in [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|the sewers]] beneath the city.
