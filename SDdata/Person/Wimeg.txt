'''Wimeg''' was an ambassador of [[Mirabar]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==Description==
Wimeg wore a purple robe that displayed the emblem of Mirabar.

==History==
The representative of Mirabar was captured by the [[Kraken Society]] in [[Leilon]], in 1358 DR. Wimeg and another representative, [[Froal]], were taken to Neverwinter and the Krakens blamed his disappearance on the [[Heroes of Ascore]]. He was kept in one of the vast gardens of Neverwinter, but was later rescued by the heroes themselves. He made his way to Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] and told him of these events.
