Wimeg was an ambassador of Mirabar circa 1358 DR.
Wimeg wore a purple robe that displayed the emblem of Mirabar.
The representative of Mirabar was captured by the Kraken Society in Leilon, in 1358 DR. Wimeg and another representative, Froal, were taken to Neverwinter and the Krakens blamed his disappearance on the Heroes of Ascore. He was kept in one of the vast gardens of Neverwinter, but was later rescued by the heroes themselves. He made his way to Lord Nasher Alagondar and told him of these events.
