He often dressed in extravagant silk robes.\nSammer was sly and intelligent with a very sharp eye for detail.\nSammer was involved with politics and family feuds back at his home in Calimshan. He frequently worked against the el Synabbat familys underhanded dealings in Skullport.\nWhen in Waterdeep he stayed at the Purple Palace in the Dock Ward.\nSammer was originally from Calimshan, but he moved to Waterdeep in the 1330s DR. As a factor, he spent most of his life traveling far from Waterdeep, making trade deals and working intrigues to shore up rulers who were friendly to his trade. He was also the most infamous factor of Waterdeep, because he usually worked to ensure no tyrant would hamper the flow of trade or misuse their power to impoverish the people. \nSammers elder brother, Ahmahd el Sufontis, was a pasha in the Trades Ward of Calimport. Sammers sister-in-law (Ahmahds widow) was married to the brother of Saida yr Oma yr Pesarkhal el Synabbat, Sammers primary \"enemy.\"\nSammer was generally disliked by his fellow Lords of Waterdeep. He, along with Khelben Arunsun invited Mirt to become a Lord of Waterdeep within a month of Mirts arrival in the city."
