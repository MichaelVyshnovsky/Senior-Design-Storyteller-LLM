        "mainbody": "Charvekkanathor the Scarlet was a mighty red dragon who made his lair at Rrinnoroth, an abandoned dwarven outpost in the Kuldin Peaks.\nHe was known to bully lesser dragons in his vicinity, and could be quite cunning and manipulative.\nCharvek laired at Rrinnoroth, perched on a high plateau of the southwestern Kuldin Peaks. He favored the location for its spectacular view of nearby realms, The lair itself was protected with explosive traps and teleportation wards.\nCharvekkanathors hoard included the Drakkalor Scepter, one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar.\nHe had an enormous taste for eating orcs, sparing the entire Lands of Intrigue region from any major problems with the creatures.\nCharvek frequently hunted nearby areas for prey.\nCharvekkanathor often fought over territory with Balagos, another venerable red dragon in the region. Both believed themselves to be \"the dragon ruler of the Sword Coast South\". Around the 13 century DR, they arrived at a small détente.\nThe blue dragon Iryklathagra considered Charvekkanathor and Balagos her only two rivals for the rulership of dragons in southern Faerûn, and fully expected to fight them both one day.\nCharvek was in an alliance of convenience with the dracolich Sapphiraktar, intending to learn magical secrets from the undead blue wyrm. Sapphiraktar, in turn, was manipulating Charvekkanathor into becoming an agent of the Twisted Rune.\nThe wyrm made his lair at Rrinnoroth beginning in the 6 century DR.\nAround 1370 DR, a group of githyanki operating out of the ruins of Torglor attempted to convince Charvekannathor to mate with their three female red dragon allies Cragnortherma, Heltipyre, and Scorlachash. They hoped to use any resulting offspring to launch an assault on the illithid stronghold of Oryndoll."
