        "mainbody": "'''Charvekkanathor the Scarlet''' was a mighty [[red dragon]] who made his lair at [[Rrinnoroth]], an abandoned [[dwarf|dwarven]] outpost in the [[Kuldin Peaks]].",
        "Personality": "He was known to bully lesser dragons in his vicinity, and could be quite cunning and manipulative.",
        "Lair": "Charvek laired at Rrinnoroth, perched on a high plateau of the southwestern Kuldin Peaks. He favored the location for its spectacular view of nearby realms, The lair itself was protected with explosive traps and ''[[teleportation]]'' wards.",
        "Possessions": "Charvekkanathor's hoard included the ''[[Drakkalor Scepter]]'', one of the ''[[Ruling Scepter of Shanatar|Ruling Scepters of Shanatar]]''.",
        "Activities": "He had an enormous taste for eating [[orc]]s, sparing the entire [[Lands of Intrigue]] region from any major problems with the creatures.\n\nCharvek frequently hunted nearby areas for prey.",
        "Relationships": "Charvekkanathor often fought over territory with [[Balagos]], another venerable red dragon in the region. Both believed themselves to be \"the dragon ruler of the [[Sword Coast]] South\". Around the 13{{th}} century DR, they arrived at a small détente.\n\nThe [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]] considered Charvekkanathor and Balagos her only two rivals for the rulership of dragons in southern [[Faerûn]], and fully expected to fight them both one day.\n\nCharvek was in an alliance of convenience with the [[dracolich]] [[Sapphiraktar]], intending to learn [[magic]]al secrets from the [[undead]] blue wyrm. Sapphiraktar, in turn, was manipulating Charvekkanathor into becoming an agent of the [[Twisted Rune]].",
        "History": "The wyrm made his lair at Rrinnoroth beginning in the 6{{th}} century DR.\n\nAround [[1370 DR]], a group of [[githyanki]] operating out of the ruins of [[Torglor]] attempted to convince Charvekannathor to mate with their three female red dragon allies: [[Cragnortherma]], [[Heltipyre]], and [[Scorlachash]]. They hoped to use any resulting offspring to launch an assault on the [[illithid]] stronghold of [[Oryndoll]]."
