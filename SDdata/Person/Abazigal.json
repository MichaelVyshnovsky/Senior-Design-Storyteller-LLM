He was one of the members of [[the Five]], the group that wreaked havoc in [[Tethyr]] during the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]].",
        "Personality": "As were many dragons, Abazigal was supremely confident, believing that only those of draconic heritage were strong enough and worthy of possessing [[Bhaal]]'s divine power.",
        "Abilities": "[[File:Blue_Dragon_(Abazigal).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Abazigal in his dragon form.]]\nAbazigal could assume the form of either a [[humanoid]] hybrid with reptilian features, or his natural state as a [[dragon]].\n\nHe was trained as a [[kensai]] and fought with an impressive level of skill and expertise.",
        "Possessions": "When in humanoid form, Abazigal wielded the unique [[greatsword]] ''[[Gram]]''. He was also in the possession of one of the missing heads of the legendary ''[[Flail of Ages]]''.",
        "Relationships": "The blue dragon Abazigal had a son named [[Draconis]], who was surprisingly enough a [[brown dragon]].\n\nThroughout his reign, Abazigal had bound a number of draconic creatures, such as [[frost salamander]]s and a [[Werewyvern|greater werewyvern]] to his service. The [[green dragon]] [[Fll'Yissetat]] was compelled to defend Abazigal's innermost sanctum under pain of ''[[geas]]''. He also had an arcane assistant in the [[mage]] known as [[Iycanth|Iycanth the Mad]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Abazigal's enclave]] was assaulted by the dragon's divine brother, [[Abdel Adrian]] and his fellow adventurers. The group killed and beheaded Draconis, using the severed head to gain entrance within the underground fortress.\n\nEventually the group made their way to the inner sanctum, and killed Abazigal himself."
