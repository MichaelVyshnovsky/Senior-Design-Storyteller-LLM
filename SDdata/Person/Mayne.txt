Elder Mayne was the mayor of Highcliff on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Elder Mayne was the mayor of Highcliff when the lizardmen attacked the boats. He tasked the Kalach-Cha to resolve the situation. The Kalach-Cha couldve defeated the lizard tribe (when Slaan leads the Kalach-Cha to the cave they inhabit), or persuade the tribe to stop the attacks and join Highcliff.
If the tribe was persuaded to join Highcliff, after the King of Shadows began his attack, the lizardmen occupied the town. Mayne asked of Kalach-Cha to save the village, to speak with the lizardmens shaman.
