'''Elder Mayne''' was the mayor of [[Highcliff]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Elder Mayne was the mayor of Highcliff when the lizardmen attacked the boats. He tasked the [[Kalach-Cha]] to resolve the situation. The Kalach-Cha could've defeated the lizard tribe (when [[Slaan]] leads the Kalach-Cha to the cave they inhabit), or persuade the tribe to stop the attacks and join Highcliff.

If the tribe was persuaded to join Highcliff, after the King of Shadows began his attack, the lizardmen occupied the town. Mayne asked of Kalach-Cha to save the village, to speak with the lizardmen's shaman.
