        "mainbody": "Thisobald Thorm was a brewer who lived in the town of Reithwin in the shadow-cursed lands during the 15 century DR.\nLike his relatives Gerringothe Thorm and Malus Thorm, he was affected by the shadow curse that plagued the land, which transformed him into an undead creature and warped his mind and body. In his cursed state, he remained cheerful and gregarious, eager to hear any stories brought by visitors to his tavern, though he was quick to turn violent if the stories bored him or if he discovered he had been lied to.\nIn his shadow-cursed undead form, Thisobalds body was grossly obese with gray, decayed-looking flesh. He had four short legs and a tail, granting him a centaur-like appearance it is unknown if he was a normal humanoid elf before becoming cursed."
