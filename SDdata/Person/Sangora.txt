'''Sangora''' was a [[vampire]] [[merchant]] in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]].

==Description==
She was very ancient, with messy, long white hair, sunken eyes, and sharp fangs.

==Personality==
Sangora loved to gossip and to ask and answer questions of new acquaintances, especially visitors to Evernight who had arrived from the [[Material Plane]]. She was quick to spot a potential customer, and would spread her [[cloak]] wide and call out to offer them her wares.

==Activities==
She was the proprietor of [[Sangora Sanguinaries]] at the [[Corpse Market]] where she sold warm blood. As a side business, she also sold information about Evernight for a hefty price (or for an answer to a probing question). She was very knowledgeable about things like Evernight history and phenomena such as the [[Crevices of Dusk]].

==Relationships==
She had four [[vampire spawn]] assistants. While she evidently trusted them, they were prone to act against her wishes when they believed that she would not learn of their disobedience.

==History==
As of the 1490s [[DR]], Sangora was active in Evernight and had not been to [[Neverwinter]] in over ten years (not since before [[Dagult Neverember]] had earned the respect of that city's people).{{Vecna-time}}
