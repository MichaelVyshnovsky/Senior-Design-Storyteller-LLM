Sangora was a vampire merchant in the Shadowfell city of Evernight.
She was very ancient, with messy, long white hair, sunken eyes, and sharp fangs.
Sangora loved to gossip and to ask and answer questions of new acquaintances, especially visitors to Evernight who had arrived from the Material Plane. She was quick to spot a potential customer, and would spread her cloak wide and call out to offer them her wares.
She was the proprietor of Sangora Sanguinaries at the Corpse Market where she sold warm blood. As a side business, she also sold information about Evernight for a hefty price (or for an answer to a probing question). She was very knowledgeable about things like Evernight history and phenomena such as the Crevices of Dusk.
She had four vampire spawn assistants. While she evidently trusted them, they were prone to act against her wishes when they believed that she would not learn of their disobedience.
As of the 1490s DR, Sangora was active in Evernight and had not been to Neverwinter in over ten years (not since before Dagult Neverember had earned the respect of that citys people).
