        "mainbody": "Michil Franzt was a tiefling proxy of the Faer√ªnian power known as Helm. He was among the few proxies that one could find on the plane of Mechanus.\nMichil had reddish skin due to his tiefling heritage and was incredibly tall.\nThis proxy was a very proud man, secure in his belief that there had rarely ever been a guardian of Helm as good as himself. He spoke only rarely, for he considered himself bound to his words.\nThe origins of Michil were a mystery to others. Some believed he came from the Prime Material plane, others that he was a planar, and some that he was a petitioner.\nRumors surrounding Michil claimed that he was capable of perceiving ill-will from miles away."
