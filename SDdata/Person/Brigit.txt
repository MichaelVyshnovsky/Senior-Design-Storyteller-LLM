Brigit was the captain of the Sisters of Synnoria, warriors of the Llewyrr.
Brigits face was exceptionally slender and fine-boned, accented by a pair of huge, luminous brown eyes. She had golden hair.
As captain of the Sisters of Synnoria, she commanded, among other Llewyrr, Maura, Carina and Aileen.
As part of the tradition in which the Sisters of Synnoria became pledged for a years service to a person of royal birth who rode Avalon, Brigit put her group at the orders of Tristan Kendrick and the defense of Caer Corwell.
