'''Avaereene''' was a [[lich]] and a former [[human]] [[wizard]] who was one of the most trusted agents of the [[Kirukeskai|Xanathar]], the leader of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] of [[Skullport]]. She oversaw the guild's slavery operations.

==Personality==
Avaereene was a cruel and efficient person; she enjoyed creating [[darkenbeast]]s to serve her deadly whims, and she intended to supplant the [[Khelben Arunsun|Blackstaff]] as the most powerful mage of Waterdeep. She formerly used her beauty and acting skills to entice adventurers into her slaving activities, but by [[1368 DR]]â€“[[1370 DR]] was coordinating activities behind the scenes. By this time, she was using a [[cantrip]] to conceal her graying hair and was feeling lonely due to her mistrust of others. She was planning to use magic to stay young once she had surpassed the Blackstaff.<ref>

==History==
[[File:Xanathar'sThieves'Guild.jpg||thumb|left|200px|''Avaereene (far left) with other members of Xanathar's Thieves' Guild.'']]
Avaereene was a skilled mage and slaver who served the Eye, capturing potential slaves in the seamier wards of Waterdeep at night. She led the Eye's snatch-and-grab kidnapping agents, known as the Hand. She commanded great loyalty from her forces, and they did anything to prevent her harm or capture. 

From [[1358 DR]] to [[1372 DR]], she was renting rooms above the Bent Nail on [[Black Cat Way]] in the [[North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. She stowed a hidden cache of magic items and spellbooks in a cellar off the south end of [[Carter's Way]] in the [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]]. She also had quarters in the Eye's stronghold in Undermountain.

By [[1479 DR]], Avaereene had become a [[lich]]{{Cite dungeon/200/Backdrop: Skullport|73}} She was now the leader of her own thieves guild called the [[Sightless]]. She concealed her true lich form under the magic-wrought false appearance of a youthful, beautiful woman with a heart-shaped face, gold curly hair and a slender figure. [[Myrin Darkdance]] destroyed the illusion during a thwarted kidnapping attempt, revealing Avaereene's true form of a rotted corpse with red eyes.
