Sonjar was an artificer, and a senior wizard in service to the Lord Artificer during the last days of Imaskar. Sonjars Tower was his residence.
Per a sign on his abode, Sonjar called it the Amethyst Tower. His tower was built inside a geode he was initially attracted to it by the concentration of earth power that it embodied.
Sonjar owned many slaves after his death, four of them perished in the barracks and his favourite became a curst. His chief cook ran away to join the Mulhorandi uprising. The artificer experimented on kidnapped priests his last victim had been a Netherese priest of Moander. His trophy room included the bone of a dinosaur, the skull of a beholder, a complete elf skeleton, and the preserved head of some angelic creature.
Sonjar had created a demiplane, almost half a mile in diameter, to hold an orchard where he grew fruit trees such as apples and pears, and also kept honey bees.
