'''Lyran Nanther''' was a member of the [[Nanther]] family of [[Melvaunt]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was known as '''Lyran the Pretender''' for his claim to rule over [[Shadowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]].

==History==
A member of the [[Nanther]] family of Melvaunt,<ref group="note">While not explicitly stated, Lyran's connection to the Nanther family of Melvaunt is evident from his name and origin. he later became a lieutenant of the [[Zhentarim]] agent [[Jyordhan]]. Jyordhan even chose Lyran to succeed him as Lord of [[Shadowdale]].

But in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, Jyordhan was killed by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]], who took the ''[[Pendant of Ashaba]]'' away to [[Waterdeep]] and promised to send a suitable person to rule Shadowdale. Lyran had no way to legitimize his claim to the lordship and was considered a pretender. This marked the beginning of the [[Time of No Lords]] in Shadowdale, when the land was leaderless, which ended three years later when Khelben gave the ''Pendant'' to the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] and [[Doust Sulwood]] ascended the lordship, who was later succeeded by [[Mourngrym Amcathra]]. Lyran and his followers made various incursions into Shadowdale, but were repelled, largely thanks to the Knights of Myth Drannor.

[[Zhentil Keep]] eventually lent Lyran an army of [[Zhentilar]] and [[Church of Bane|Banite]] priests in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, however. With it, he made various incursions and attacked Shadowdale to wrest the lordship from Mourngrym in the [[First Battle of Shadowdale]], but his army was routed in a heroic defense. Lyran was forced to leave<ref>"A Grand Tour of the Realms", page 67, mentions "this branch of the family has been banished (and supposedly the young lord destroyed when he failed in his attempt)", missing words and making it ambiguous as to whether Lyran was slain in the battle or was executed by Melvaunt's Council of Lords later.

When Melvaunt's Council of Lords discovered Lyran's association with Zhentil Keep after this defeat, they had the Nanther family banished from Melvaunt.

==Home==
While in Shadowdale as a lieutenant of Jyordhan, Lyran and the other lieutenants lived in a manor house built for them in an area known as the Bog.
