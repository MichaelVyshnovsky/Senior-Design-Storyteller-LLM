Carlon Amoffel was an agent of the Harpers that operated throughout the Sword Coast, and was tasked with investigating the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 century DR.
He had a tattoo of the Harpers insignia inscribed upon his arm.
Some time in the 1480s DR, Carlon began investigating a group of dragon cult smugglers that were transporting stolen goods north along the Trade Way towards Waterdeep. When the cultists began to suspect his affiliation, Carlon attempted to share what he learned with another agent at the inn. Unfortunately the Dragon Cult labeled him a supported of local bandits, and local townspeople buried him up to his neck along the road, and painted the epithet "Oathbreaker" upon his forehead.
While Carlon remained immobile in the dirt, he concocted a tale that he was betrothed to a woman whose family members were avowed bandits. He then valiantly ended their engagement when it became clear he was expected to join her familys trade.
