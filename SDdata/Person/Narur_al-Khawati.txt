Narur al-Khawati was a waterfinder for the desert centaurs of the Khawati Clan in the Burning Lands near Moradask in 1367 DR.
The Khawati Clans leader, and Narurs sister, deferred to her judgement in important decisions.
She rescued her sister from the clutches of the Shorn, a devious cult active in the region. Her auguries warned of danger to the clan if they pursued a vendetta against the Shorn, but the clans leader ignored the threats in pursuit of vengeance.
Narur carried a jambiya.
Narur was the older sister of the clans leader Tebessa al-Khawati.
