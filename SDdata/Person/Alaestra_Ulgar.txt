Alaestra Ulgar was a shopkeeper of the Lions Share store in Triboar in the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.
Together with Narth Tezrin, the young proprietors managed a prosperous business, but endured a little harassment and insults from locals.
Although they had since seperated, she was once married to Darthag Ulgar, who also worked for the Lionshield Coster at their post in Nightstone.
