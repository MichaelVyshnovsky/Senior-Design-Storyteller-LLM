        "Personality": "He was a skeptical but faithful imperial servant, who was wholly dedicated to his role serving Minister Hsieh. While he was prone to occasional missteps, the minister had faith in Yu Po's capabilities.",
        "Activities": "While Yu Po spoke for Hsieh and acted as his public translator, the elder minister was fully capable of speaking and understanding the [[Common]] language of Faerûn.",
        "Relationships": "Yu Po was extremely loyal to and defensive of Minister Hsieh, ready to raise his weapon to his master's defense at a moment's notice.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, Yu Po was present with the minister when his caravan was intercepted by [[Vaerana Hawklyn]] and the [[Maces of Elversult]] and then escorted to the [[Ginger Palace]] while they negotiated the release of the captured [[Harper]] agent [[Ruha]],\n\nShortly after their initial arrival, Yu Po attended Minister Hsieh as he began talks with Vaerana Hawklyn about how to best deal with the threat of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and their [[dracolich|undead]] master [[Hethcypressarvil]]. He accompanied the minister towards [[Elversult]], to the point just prior to when Hsieh helped lead a final stand against the dragon and its cult."
