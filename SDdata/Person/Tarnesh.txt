'''Tarnesh''' was a bounty hunter [[mage]] active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''How rude. No really, that is utterly rude of you. I'd teach you a lesson about manners, but that implies that you are going to live. If I weren't going to anyway, I'd kill you just for being so uppity.''|Tarnesh}}

==Possessions==
Tarnesh was armed with a simple [[quarterstaff]] and his ''[[spellbook]]'' contained simple [[spell]]s such as ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[horror]]'', and ''[[magic missile]].''

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Tarnesh put his sights on [[Gorion's Ward]], Abdel Adrian. A hefty bounty of 200 [[gold]] [[coin]]s was placed on Abdel's head. The wizard tracked his mark down at the entrance to the [[Friendly Arm Inn]]. Tarnesh was unlikely to have survived the confrontation.
