Mornmaster '''Stellaga Brightstar''' was the [[Lathanderian]] high priestess of the [[Glory of the Morning]] temple in [[Archenbridge]].

==Description==
She was a rather tall and lean woman.

==Personality==
Mornmaster Stellaga was a soft-spoken and diplomatic leader,  who could be quite an upstart when she so chose. 

==Activities==
The efforts of Stellaga and her priests brought much wealth and prosperity to Archenbridge and greatly improved the lives of its residents.

While she was dedicated to her work, Stellaga took little time to indulge in her more secret indulgences, including dancing, adventuring and enjoying romances with travelers from far-off lands. 

==Relationships==
Stellaga was aided in her duties by Hand of Lathander, [[Morninglord|High Morninglord]] [[Orblin Storntar]] and 15 other clergy members of the temple.

==History==
On one occasion, the [[barbarian]] [[Belorn|Belorn "Battleaxe"]] the [[barbarian]] attempted to escort Stellaga and commander [[Jalia Mossgreen]] to a revel hosted by the [[Arkhen Clan]]. Despite being influential leaders both, Stellaga and Jalia managed to get into a fairly serious fight that evening. It was Belorn that came out worse for wear however, when he attempted to "protect" them from one another.
