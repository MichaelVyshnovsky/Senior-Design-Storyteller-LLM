'''Snilloc''' was an adventuring [[wizard]] who lived some time in the 13{{th}} century by [[Marking the Years|Dalereckoning]].

==Biography==
Snilloc gained fame among his fellow wizards by developing several cold-based [[evocation]]s and fame more generally when he helped save [[Procampur]] from a horde of [[hobgoblin]]s.

Rumor had it that Snilloc spent his final years living in [[Zakhara]].

==Legacy==
Snilloc was the inventor of three known spells in the Realms, ''[[Snilloc's snowball]]'', ''[[Snilloc's snowball swarm]]'' and ''[[Snilloc's major missile]]'',<ref> as well as a rumored fourth, ''[[Snilloc's cream pie]]''. There also existed a [[path of power]] based on Snilloc's magic, a so-called lost path which was not publicly known.<ref>{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power}}

==Personality==
If Snilloc's personality indeed came through in his writings, then he was apparently a patronizing and overly self-confident individual.

==Relationships==
Snilloc was one of several powerful mages that were mortified and infuriated when some of their spells were published in ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]''. He was heard to say that [[Volothamp Geddarm]] deserved to lose his head after spending "most of eternity as a dung beetle crushed under a rock at the bottom of a cesspool."
