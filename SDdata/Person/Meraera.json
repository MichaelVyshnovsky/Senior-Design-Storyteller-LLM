        "mainbody": "Meraera was a sun elf wizard and an Olin Gisir active in the midâ€“14 century DR. She had studied ancient lore in and around Silverymoon in the Silver Marches for many years.\nIn addition to being a capable wizard, Meraera had the skills and powers of an Olin Gisir, possessing ancient knowledge, the ability to read mystic omens, the power to ward off fiends, and a knack for finding what was hidden.\nShe wore an amulet of natural armor +1, bracers of armor +2, a cloak of resistance +2, a headband of intellect +2, and a ring of protection +1, and fought with a masterwork rapier and longbow. She was also equipped with a lens of detection, an elixir of vision, a few potions of cure light wounds, and a scroll of greater magic weapon.\nMeraera had a raven familiar named Feor.\nIn the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Meraera learned of a recently discovered tower in the ruins of the ancient sun elven realm of Siluvanede. She quickly went to an adventurers guild in search of adventurers to accompany her on expedition to there.\nShe once explored the ruins of a temple to the Abyssal demon lord Astaroth, and feared he slumbered within, but claimed to be prepared.It is unclear if the temple to Astaroth was found within the Siluvanedenn ruins, though this is likely given that realms history."
