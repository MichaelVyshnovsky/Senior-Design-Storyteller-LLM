'''Timmis Taern''' was a ruler of [[Edenvale]] and a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]). Timmis ruled from [[Edenvale Castle]] and was known to be prideful but lacking in tactical ability.

The leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]], who sought to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest, lured Timmis beyond the castle walls through simple trickery before striking in a bloodforge battle.
