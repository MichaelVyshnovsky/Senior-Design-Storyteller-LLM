'''Pertelope''' was headmistress at the [[Edificant Library]] in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] of [[Erlkazar]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was also one of the [[Chosen]] of the god [[Deneir]].

==Description==
Pertelope had graying hair but her hazel eyes displayed a youthful inquisitiveness. She was neat and well groomed, though not modest, but after the effects of the Chaos Curse, Pertelope began covering herself with [[gown]]s that were long-sleeved, ankle-length, and done up tightly at the collar, as well as gloves. This concealed her transformed [[shark]] skin.

==Personality==
The priestess was wistful, irreverent, and preferred to follow common sense rather than stick strictly to rules. Pertelope was a chosen of Deneir and had the ability to hear Deneir's song.

She had an affinity for [[shark]]s and had loved watching them swimming in the water when going out fishing with her father.

==Abilities==
Pertelope's god bestowed on her powers granting prophetic dreams.

==Activities==
She was a headmistress at the Edificant Library and lived in a room above the great hall.

==Relationships==
Pertelope was a mentor and substitute mother to the priest [[Cadderly Bonaduce]].<ref> Pertelope meant even more to Cadderly after he discovered himself to be a chosen of Deneir.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1361}}, when the Edificant Library was assaulted by agents of [[Castle Trinity]] with the [[Chaos Curse]], Pertelope lost herself in her affinity for sharks, resulting in maintaining a featureless torso covered by a shark skin with sharp-edged pentacles. Being half-human and half-shark made breathing air as poisonous to her as water.
