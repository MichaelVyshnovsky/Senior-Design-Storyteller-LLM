'''Ethe''' was a remnant of the ancient incarnation of the [[Sisterhood of the Silver Fire|Sisters of the Silver Fire]] who guarded the [[Shrine of the Silver Fire]] in [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gulrithi, an ancient [[dark naga]] necromancer created a lair within the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The dark naga hated [[Mystra]], the goddess of magic, and attempted to defile the Shrine of the Silver Fire which was maintained by Ethe and [[Gloran]], two [[guardian naga]] priestesses of the Lady of Mystery. Gulrithi lured the [[cleric]]s into a magical trap. The two nagas remained in stasis until a group of [[adventurer]]s known as the [[Veiled Ones]] slew Gulrithi and his [[mohrg]]s and master [[wight]]s. The heroes broke the ''head pole'' that maintained the stasis trap, releasing the Sisters. Ethe returned to the Shrine and reignited its divine Silver Fire, continuing to guard it against the invading force of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
