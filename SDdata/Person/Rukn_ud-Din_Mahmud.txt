Rukn ud-Din Mahmud was a caravan guard commander living in the Hordelands during the mid 14 century DR.
Rukn was a devout believer of the Muhjari teachings, though he maintained a more practical outlook on situations. He forbade the consumption of alcohol among his soldiers, but allowed other vices he deemed necessary.
Rukn wielded an enchanted mace, wore enchanted plate mail, and carried an elixir of health and a rod of flailing.
