        "mainbody": "Zarad was the Chief Vizier and a skilled shair who lived in Halwa in 1367 DR.\nZarad always donned black-and-white striped robes, making him easy to spot at court.\nThough he served as the caliphs vizier, Zarad was the true ruler of Halwa. All of Caliph Hava al-Gatils orders came directly from Zarad.\nZarad used his influence to enact an unfair taxation system for several years, allowing him to amass a great fortune before dismissing the tax before the caliph could discover what was going on.\nHe hoped to one day marry the Caliphs eldest daughter, Sikayah, to solidify a potential claim on the throne.\nZarad had been the caliphs adviser since the caliph was a mere child, allowing him to develop a firm control over his actions throughout the years.\nThe shair was served by a powerful dao referred to only as \"Zarads Pet\".\nZarad planned to marry the caliphs eldest daughter to cement his rule over Halwa."
