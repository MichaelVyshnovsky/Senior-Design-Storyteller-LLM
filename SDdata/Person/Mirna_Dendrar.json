They had two children, Nars and Nilsa.\nMirna was born in Thundertree where her family ran an herbalism and alchemy shop prior to the towns destruction by the eruption of Mount Hotenow.\nCirca 1491 DR, the Redbrand bandits of Phandalin made crude leers at Mirna. Her husband, Thel, had had enough of the group that terrorized the area, and so he stood up to them. He was subsequently killed by them.\nAfter her husbands death, she and her two children were taken to the cellar of Tresendar Manor, and thrown into the slave pen. The Redbrands planned to sell them off as slaves."
