Her husband, Thel, had had enough of the group that terrorized the area, and so he stood up to them. He was subsequently killed by them.\n\nAfter her husband's death, she and her two children were taken to the cellar of [[Tresendar Manor]], and thrown into the slave pen. The Redbrands planned to sell them off as slaves."
