The [[Xanathar]] used him as bookkeeper and information storehouse. Slink also commanded Xanathar's network of spies and had information about all the guild's operations, and all the other masters sent reports to him. The Xanathar trusted him and knew, by use of spells, that Slink was loyal but kept a very close eye on him; if someone captured him, they could learn all about the Xanathar Guild.",
