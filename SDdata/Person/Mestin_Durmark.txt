Mestin "Troll" Durmark was a captain of the Freedom Riders of Daggerdale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She got her nickname from how she dealt with their enemies.
She had a wary, but friendly personality and always stuck to her duty. She would always help someone in need if their goals aligned with those of her group.
Among her equipped gear were bracers of defense, a +1 ring of protection, and a +1 longsword.
Mestin was next to Ariton Delmis as the most high-ranking member of the Riders under Randal Morn. When Randal disappeared, she helped Ariton to organize the liberation army in the Dagger Hills.
