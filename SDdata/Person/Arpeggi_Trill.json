The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby black dragon, only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of Cormyrean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep."
