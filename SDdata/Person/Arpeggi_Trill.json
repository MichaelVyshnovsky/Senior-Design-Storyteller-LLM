        "mainbody": "'''Arpeggi Trill''' (not his real name) was a [[Sembite]] [[half-elf]] [[adventurer]] and [[bard]] who was part of the [[Ruby Blades]] [[adventuring company]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Arpeggi was clever and quick-witted, and enjoyed making up mocking rhymes to unnerve the party's rivals.",
        "Possessions": "Arpeggi carried a ''+2 [[broadsword]]'', a ''[[harp of charming]]'', and a ''[[brooch of shielding]]'', in addition to his mundane [[leather armor]] and [[lute]].",
        "Abilities": "He prepared a array of esoteric bardic [[spell]]s that could be used in a wide variety of situations.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Ruby Blades joined the [[Wolfmasters]] company on an excursion to explore and loot [[Orvaskyte Keep]] in the [[Vast Swamp]]. The Ruby Blades were heavily delayed, and by the time they arrived their allies were already dead. Seeking a new goal, they attempted to hunt a nearby [[black dragon]], only to be overwhelmed and almost killed by it, and were rescued by a band of [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers. Their fortune waxed once more, and they were joined by two-dozen mercenaries that allowed them to chase away the Cormyreans and secure what was left of Orvaskyte Keep."
