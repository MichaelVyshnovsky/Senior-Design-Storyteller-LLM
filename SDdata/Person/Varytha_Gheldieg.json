She was also a [[necromancer]]\n\nVarytha Gheldeig was actively trying to get a spy in a position near the [[Council of Six]] and was also looking for influence over her fellow Cowled Wizards. Her apprentice, [[Zallanora Argentresses]], was strongly encouraged to apply her elven beauty and charm to gaining favor and knowledge from others who wore the Cowl and to report back to Varytha. Little did she know that the lovely Zallanora had her own plans for gaining power and influence.\n\nVarytha discreetly took delivery of the bodies of any person who died in Eshpurta alone and too destitute to afford a proper burial. What she did with those corpses was known to very few."
