The '''Shifter''' was a [[shade]] [[wizard]] and member of the [[Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun]] in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
She was the wizard of the Cavus Dun squad tasked by [[Effron]] with finding [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}. The Shifter survived the first skirmish and later attacked the pair of [[elves]] again with her fellows and a larger squad of reinforcements in [[Gauntlgrym]]. However, the intervention of [[drow]] of [[House Xorlarrin]] caused the defeat of the Shadovar.
