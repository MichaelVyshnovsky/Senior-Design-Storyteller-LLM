'''Rurik''' was a [[dwarven]] man that lived on the [[Sword Coast]] for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|You won't get any further this way, friend. Road's blocked up ahead.|Rurik.}}

==Possessions==
He wielded a pair of [[dagger]]s in battle and made liberal use of [[poison]] on his blades.

==Relationships==
For a while, Rurik traveled alongside the fallen [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] [[Anders]], the [[wizard]] [[Cyrel]], and the [[ranger]] [[Trynn]].

==History==
Rurik and his companions spent some time guarding a tollhouse on the [[Risen Road]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when it was attacked by a band of vicious [[gnoll]] [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]]. They managed to turn away the bestial raiders, while Rurik himself killed the largest of their force, but could not save the lives of the innocent toll takers.
