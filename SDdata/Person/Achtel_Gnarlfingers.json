        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], Achtel's chieftain gathered over six hundred orcs to rally to [[Obould Many-Arrows]]'s cause, mainly to fight the [[dwarves]] of [[Mithral Hall]]. Achtel tried to dissuade the chieftain, and she was hesitant about the move. After the fall of the town of Shallows, a fellow shaman, [[Arganth Snarrl]], proclaimed that Obould was in fact a [[god]]-king. Achtel was the sole shaman to not be persuaded by the charismatic and intelligent shaman. Arganth believed the tribes should unite under Obould, but Achtel, who headed the largest force of orcs, wished to stay independent.\n\n{{fq\n|text=Achtel did not believe, and so Achtel was murdered.\n|source=Arganth Snarrl\n}}\nLater, the renegade [[drow]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], slew Achtel Gnarlfingers.
