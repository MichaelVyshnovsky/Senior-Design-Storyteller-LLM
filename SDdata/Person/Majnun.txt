'''Majnun''' was a [[janni]] of the [[Haunted Lands]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p44">

==Activities==
Majnun's whereabouts remained unknown. His brethren of the [[Jann of the Haunted Lands]] believed he stole from Amir [[Heidar Qan]] or poisoned him, depending on who was asked. Majnun fled into the vast desert in fear of his life. Majnun traveled disguised as a mystic, but was wary around [[genie]]s, especially other jann. A great reward was offered for his capture.
