Prince Zherost was the nephew and the next in the line of succession of King Ulther, who lived, died, and became a ghost, long before 1372 DR.
Ulthers reign was cut short when his nephew, Prince Zherost, filled Kings gold-plated plate mail with deadly contact poison. Ulther wore the poisoned armor to a knight tournament and perished the following day. However, his spirit did not depart the Prime Material plane. Instead, it became bound to the armor he died in, haunting it like other ghosts haunted old dank castles. Prince Zherost wore the same plate armor to his coronation, and as the ceremony went on, the ghost of King Ulther drove his nephew to panic. Before the coronation ceremony was completed, Zherost dashed out of the castle, striking in terror. As he fled, the Prince stumbled and plummeted into the castles moat and drowned. It was said that both Zherost and Ulther were still bound to what became known as the Haunted Armor.
In 1372 DR, the Haunted Armor was located in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill, available for sale with not many brave or stupid buyers.
