'''Zasian Menz''' was a priest of [[Cyric]], who posed as a [[Church of Bane|Banite]] in order to enter [[Dweomerheart]] and steal [[Old Staff|Azuth's staff]], enabling Cyric to kill [[Mystra]].

==Description==
Zasian was described as young and handsome. He was tall with long dark hair and a long mustache. He wore black leather [[trousers]] and a black & gold [[tunic]].

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], Zasian was serving as the seneschal of [[Helm Dwarf-Friend]] in [[Sundabar]]. Masquerading as a high priest of [[Bane]], he allied with [[Kaanyr Vhok]], who intended to discredit Dwarf-Friend and take over the city for himself. Zasian and Vhok concocted a plan to have [[Aliisza]] captured by [[angel]] servants of [[Tyr]]. He explained the plan to her, which revolved around opening a [[portal]] from inside the [[House of the Triad]], and placed a ''[[geas]]'' on her so that she would not remember the plan until she saw her son for the first time. He and Vhok, accompanied by [[Myshik Morueme]], then traveled to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] to reach the other end of the portal.

Upon passing through the portal, Zasian possessed the [[storm dragon]] [[Tekthyrios]] and was revealed to be a priest of [[Cyric]] rather than Bane. Pursued by the [[astral deva]] [[Tauran]], Vhok (whom he betrayed), Aliisza, and the knight [[Kael]]; and aided by Myshik; Zasian freed [[Kashada]] the Nightwraith, an aspect of [[Shar]], and journeyed to [[Dweomerheart]]. Their pursuit created enough distraction that Zasian and Kashada were able to steal [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]]. Once Kashada had the staff, though, she plunged a dagger into Zasian's back. At the same time, Cyric used the staff to slay [[Mystra]], unleashing a torrent of magical fury.

In the chaos surrounding Mystra's death, Zasian inadvertently melded with a neighboring [[planetar]] in his mind, healing his body but turning it into a soulless [[Living Vessel]]. Zasian was left with no memories of anything from before his transformation, but was able to use his divine magic to heal Aliisza and her companions for a time. His mind deteriorated rapidly, though, ultimately leaving him an empty husk. Aliisza subsequently used the severed, desiccated finger of [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] to summon Pharaun's soul into Zasian's body. The body was polymorphed to appear as Pharaun's own for a brief time, until he was killed by a blast of lightning from the dying hybrid of Myshik and the astral deva [[Micus]]. Zasian's body reverted to its original form in death.
