        "mainbody": "Zrumya was a giant bat who worked in the general store that belonged to Ibn Engaruka of Port Castigliar, in the 14 century DR.\nZrumya was a well-trained giant bat about the size of an adult human. The bat could understand instructions given to it by Inyanga. Zrumya moved and carried the stores boxed goods using the claws located on its wing joints. The dire bat had a bundle strapped to its chest to move goods around the shelves and hard-to-access storage places to help with its duties. Zrumyas skittering on the store floor and high walls of boxes reminded observers of a moving spider. When not working, Zrumya could be found on its perch inside the general store.\nZrumya was a loyal guardian of the young shopkeepers son, Inyanga Engaruka, helping the child maintain the store, and defended him fearlessly if Inyanga was ever threatened.\nIn 1362 DR, Artus Cimber and Hydel Pontifax encountered Zrumya and its young master Inyanga Engaruka when they traveled to Chult in search of the fabled Ring of Winter."
