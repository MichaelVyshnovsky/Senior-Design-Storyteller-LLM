        "mainbody": "'''Zrumya''' was a [[giant bat]] who worked in the general store that belonged to [[Ibn Engaruka]] of [[Port Castigliar]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Zrumya! Pick up in row two, level six!''|[[Inyanga Engaruka]]}}",
        "Description": "Zrumya was a well-trained giant [[bat]] about the size of an adult [[human]]. The bat could understand instructions given to it by Inyanga. Zrumya moved and carried the store's boxed goods using the claws located on its wing joints. The dire bat had a bundle strapped to its chest to move goods around the shelves and hard-to-access storage places to help with its duties. Zrumya's skittering on the store floor and high walls of boxes reminded observers of a moving [[spider]]. When not working, Zrumya could be found on its perch inside the general store.",
        "Relationships": "Zrumya was a loyal guardian of the young shopkeeper's son, Inyanga Engaruka, helping the child maintain the store, and defended him fearlessly if Inyanga was ever threatened.",
        "History": "In [[1362 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} [[Artus Cimber]] and [[Hydel Pontifax]] encountered Zrumya and its young master Inyanga Engaruka when they traveled to Chult in search of the fabled ''[[Ring of Winter]]''."
