        "mainbody": "Dretchroyaster (), or simply \"Dretch\", was an ancient green dracolich.\nDretchroyaster was well known as a merciless hunter, an avaricious builder of hoards, and as a cunning adversary. Yet his perhaps most defining characteristic was his desperation to avoid death, which ultimately motivated him to become a dracolich. Still, because Dretch was so rarely challenged, his confidence had not grown to the point where he exhibited the fearlessness common to many other dracoliches. Dretchroyaster would usually only fight when cornered, and preferred to weaken and distract his foes with traps and foils rather than face them in the open. He had a keen mind for tactics and often sought to use familiar terrain to his advantage.\nIn terms of diet, he greatly enjoyed the flesh of centaurs and considered elves an unfortunately too-rare delicacy. Most of the time he was forced to eat more plentiful fare humans and horses, either of which could be found in abundance in most any caravan. For the sake of his twisted humor, he would sometimes also eat treants. Aside from his relative cowardice, one of Dretchroyasters primary weaknesses was letting his guard down too much when eating. Naturally, after his dracolich transformation his enthusiasm for food was lessened somewhat (but not entirely), and a few near-death experiences eventually taught him to be more alert when dining.\nHis primary goal was transforming himself into a spelljammer and flying into space.\nthumb|300px|Insert wit here.\n* Dragonslair\n* Diamond Staff of Chomylla\n(Born between  and )\nThe Cult of the Dragon had long sought to convince Dretchroyaster to undergo transformation into a dracolich, but the green dragon refused to even consider it. Ultimately, it would take over a century of persuasion and two close brushes with death to coax him. The first of these occurred in the , when Dretchroyaster awoke from a hundred-year slumber and decided to terrorize the region. The menace was so great that several normally independent adventuring companies banded together to form the Crossed Swords and hunt the dragon down. Dretchroyaster was seriously injured in the ensuing fight but managed to escape to his secret lair. The Crossed Swords could not find the lair, and so stopped the hunt. The events of Dretchs rampage were later recounted in the ballad \"The Clouds Came Rolling In\".\nThe second incident took place in the , when the Merry Marauders ambushed Dretchroyaster while he was feeding on three centaurs of the Cloven Hoof tribe south of Myth Drannor. The green dragon was taken by surprise and sustained severe injuries that forced him to flee back to his lair. The Merry Marauders pursued him but could not find the lair proper, only a narrow ventilation shaft. The adventurers cast several spells of cloudkill and incendiary cloud down the chute, further injuring Dretchroyaster. But they could not finish him off.\nWhat neither Dretchroyaster nor the Merry Marauders knew was that the adventurers had been covertly hired by Larkonlan, a wizard in the Sembian cell of the Cult of the Dragon. The wizards gambit was meant to frighten Dretchroyaster enough so that he would finally accept the Cults offer of dracolichdom. Shortly after the attack, Larkonlan approached Dretchroyaster bearing spectacular offerings. The wizard once again raised the possibility of dracholichdom and offered Dretch a new lair The result was Dragonslair, a magical longsword&mdashmodeled on Larkonlans own swords of dragonblood&mdashthat held the actual phylactery in its pommel, allowing Dretch to influence its wielder from within the sword itself.\nDretch was first recorded  in chronicles when, in the Year of Watery Graves, 1091 DR, he battled the old female black dragon Naxorlytaalsxar the Terror Tenebrous, in an aerial duel. In the so-called Battle of Falling Fishkill, Dretch accidentally poisoned Lake Sember, forcing the aquatic elves living there into exile. During this time, Dretch regularly mated with a venerable female green dragon Verthandantalynx, the Verdant Cloud, and considered her his mate.\nAt that time, the wizard Larkonlan, a high-ranking member in the Sembian Cult of the Dragon cell, approached the dragon, offering transformation into dracolich and a new lair. (Unknown to Dretch, it was Larkonlan who had sent the Merry Marauders.) So in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR, Dretchroyaster shifted his lair to Monarchs Fall Glade, the remains of an elven spelljammer discovered by some adventurers hired by the Cult. Dretch was amazed by his new lair and invested much time in modifying the surrounding terrain and studying the spelljammer. Finally, in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR, Dretch accepted transformation into a dracolich and adopted the sobriquet \"The Monarch Reborn\".\nIn the late 15th century DR, the Turmish wizard Imani hired adventurers to infiltrate Dretchroyasters lair and recover the Diamond Staff of Chomylla.\nRumors circulated that the Sembian cell of the Cult of the Dragon attempted to accelerate Dretchroyasters aging even in undeath by using daggers of life stealing to somehow inject him with the stolen lives of their victims."
