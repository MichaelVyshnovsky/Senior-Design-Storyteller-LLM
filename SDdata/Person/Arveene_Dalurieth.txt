Arveene Dalurieth was Vonn Dalurieths daughter.
She was round-faced with freckled cheeks, a snub nose, and dark hair.
Much of her rooms contents were themed around bears.
The avariel bladesinger Taegan Nightwind tried to retrieve her from her home one night, believing she was in love with Falar Aporos. Though he fought with her guardians, he later realized his mistake and left without her.
