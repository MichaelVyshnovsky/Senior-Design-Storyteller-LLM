The '''Spirit of the Forest''' was an entity that became trapped in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
The Spirit of the Forest appeared much larger than a humanoid. It had huge, stag-like horns and a human-like body.

==History==
As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Everspring Tree]] became corrupted by the [[crystal cultist]]s' foul [[magic]]. In its corrupt state, it trapped the Spirit of the Forest in its strong roots.
