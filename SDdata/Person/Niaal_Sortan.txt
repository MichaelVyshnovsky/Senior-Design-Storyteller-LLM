'''Niaal Sortan''' was a sadistic priestess of [[Bhaal]], the god of murder, who resided in the seemingly peaceful monastery that later came to be known as the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]] of [[Liam's Hold]].

==Possessions==
An [[enchanted]] [[warhammer]] - ''[[the Black Hammer]]'', was Niaal Sortan's favorite weapon, accompanying her on countless late-night rampages of torturing innocents.

==History==
Niaal Sortan gained her foul reputation sometime before [[1358 DR]], for regularly traveling the lads surrounding [[Liam's Hold]] and torturing creatures with her magical [[acid]]-spewing hammer in praise of her dark deity. During one of her evil nocturnal expeditions, Niaal Sortan was ambushed by a gang of [[ranger]]s and slain. However, the rangers all were splattered by deadly acid of the ''the Black Hammer'' and perished from their injuries soon after.
