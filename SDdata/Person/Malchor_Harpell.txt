Malchor Harpell () was a member of the Harpers that hailed from the Harpell family of Longsaddle. He resided in the Tower of Twilight, which stood east of the Neverwinter Wood.
Even though Malchor was Khelben Arunsuns second-most powerful follower, other than Laeral Silverhand, he was also the most skeptical of the Moonstars.
Although Malchor was a Harpell, he did not share the eccentric ways of his cousins and deigned to live away from Longsaddle.
The wizard spent most of his time training other mages along with researching magical items and their creation. Specifically, he mastered the art of crafting staves of the magi and wands of magic missile, as well as rings of feather fall and the ring of warmth.
Along with the items he regularly created, Malchor carried a lurker cloak and a +3 ring of protection when he traveled.
As of the mid–1350s DR, Malchor had a teenaged apprentice who was the son of wealthy family. Malchor made him take a vow of silence, which he believed would help teach him the discipline needed for his studies of magic.
He himself was a student of the first Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun.
Malchor was a member of the Company of Crazed Venturers.
In the , Malchor gave the scimitar Twinkle to the renegade drow Drizzt DoUrden, .
Around the  he defected from the Harpers to the Moonstars.
After the Spellplague struck the Realms in the , Malchor and his tower disappeared from Neverwinter Wood. 
Circa late 1487 DR, Malchor was alive and competed with other archmages for the possession of the Lost Spell during a spellstorm, as well as informing his fellow "captive" archwizards that he currently was spending his efforts on securing the future of Faerûn, through the making of strong family ties.
Malchor wrote a book about Khelben and Laeral called Two Mages Legacies.
