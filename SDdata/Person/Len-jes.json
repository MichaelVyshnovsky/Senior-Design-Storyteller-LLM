        "mainbody": "Corsair\nLen-jes was the harbormaster of the Docks District of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR. \nLen-jes was known for her scars.\nLen-jes appeared to be calm and collected, but actually the fury of the Elemental Chaos burned in her.\nLen-jes was Neverwinters habormaster, chief exchequer and accountant. As the master of trade of Neverwinter, she was vital to keep commerce flowing into the City.\nLen-jes was a \"hydromancer\", and so her abilities were stronger that those of the standard watersoul genasi. She had a reputation of being a powerful combatant.\nYears before 1479 DR, Len-jes was a corsair in the Sea of Fallen Stars. However, her enemies forced her to flee and hide in Waterdeep. In the City of Splendors, Len-jes was contacted by Dagult Neverember, who hired her to be the harbormaster of Neverwinter.\nIn 1479 DR, she became a semi-permanent resident of the Beached Leviathan. \nDuring the civil unrest caused by the supposed \"Lost Heir of Alagondar\", Len-jes took sides with Neverembers loyalists.\nPeople were unsure of Len-jes true allegiances. Many believed she was working undercover for the Thayans, the Ashmadai, or for pirates from Laerakond, while others believed she was a Harper agent instead. For other people, however, she was just a power-hungry lackey of Neverember."
