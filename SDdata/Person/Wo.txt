'''Wo''' was the owner of the [[House of Wo]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Wo oversaw all food preparation for his [[caravanserai]]. When not spending time in the kitchen, he enjoyed conversing with his guests, even though his command of [[midani]] was limited.

Wo also tutored [[Fayaniz al-Nokar]] in the ways of the [[wu jen]].

==History==
Wo was initially from a land in the far east called [[Shou Lung]]. No one knew why he left his home or why he decided to settle in [[Zakhara]], but his culinary skills were greatly appreciated in Huzuz.
