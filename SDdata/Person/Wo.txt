Wo was the owner of the House of Wo in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Wo oversaw all food preparation for his caravanserai. When not spending time in the kitchen, he enjoyed conversing with his guests, even though his command of midani was limited.
Wo also tutored Fayaniz al-Nokar in the ways of the wu jen.
Wo was initially from a land in the far east called Shou Lung. No one knew why he left his home or why he decided to settle in Zakhara, but his culinary skills were greatly appreciated in Huzuz.
