'''Gormauthator''' was a [[skeleton]] [[red dragon]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
Gormauthator was one of the [[dragon]]s that assaulted [[Shadowdale]] in 1356 DR during a flight of dragons; [[Sylun√© Silverhand]] fought the three more powerful dragons, among those Gormauthator, at the [[twisted Tower of Ashaba|Tower of Ashaba]] and destroyed the dragons at the price of her own life. In 1375 DR in a effort to terrify the population, the cleric of [[Shar]] [[Esvele Greycastle]] raised Gormauthator as a skeleton to guard Sylune's tomb.
