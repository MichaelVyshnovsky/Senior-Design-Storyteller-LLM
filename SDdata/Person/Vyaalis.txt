}}'''Vyaalis''' was from the [[Coral Kingdom]], a [[sea elf|sea elven]] kingdom in the [[Trackless Sea]] near [[Evermeet]].

==History==
For a time, he lived in [[Memnon]], learning the art of longsword fighting from Shieldlord [[Hastor el Khafar]].

Something of a wanderer, Vyaalis's curiosity led him to explore the surface world in [[Calimshan]] and [[Tethyr]]. His interest in the longsword stemmed from his discovery of one among the wreckage of the ''[[Pasha's Palace]]'', a sunken [[Calishite]] vessel.
