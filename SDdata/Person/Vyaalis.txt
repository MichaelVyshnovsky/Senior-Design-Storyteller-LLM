Vyaalis was from the Coral Kingdom, a sea elven kingdom in the Trackless Sea near Evermeet.
For a time, he lived in Memnon, learning the art of longsword fighting from Shieldlord Hastor el Khafar.
Something of a wanderer, Vyaaliss curiosity led him to explore the surface world in Calimshan and Tethyr. His interest in the longsword stemmed from his discovery of one among the wreckage of the Pashas Palace, a sunken Calishite vessel.
