        "History": "In early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, Hammuras was in debt to [[Caethur]]; at a meeting the moneylender had with him and five other debtors in a room overlooking [[Jembril Street]]. He made the payment to Caethur, but after the brass merchant [[Aldurl Nael]] did not, the moneylender murdered the non-paying debtor. Caethur had his men murder all the others anyway, as they were witnesses to the murder."
