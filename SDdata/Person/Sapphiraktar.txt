Sapphiraktar was an ancient male blue dracolich and a member of the Twisted Rune.
Out of vanity, the dracolich maintained his dragon appearance through magic. 
Preparing to kill Jymahna for spying, Sapphiraktar taught dragon magic to Rhangaun.
Sapphiraktar made his cavern home in the  ruined city of Teshyll west of Alatorin in Calimshan.
Around 1072 DR, Sapphiraktar became a dracolich.
