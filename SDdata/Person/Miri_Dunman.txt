Captain Miri Dunman was an officer of the Purple Dragons, in charge of the force that oversaw the Black Crater from 1372 DR onwards.
Miri was a young woman in 1372 DR, but appeared grim and tired from the stress of her posting at the Black Crater.
In , Miri was deployed to guard and monitor the ruins of Tilverton and the Moonsea Ride on Cormyrs northern frontier. When her scouts reported orcish raiders at the nearby Netherese ruins, Steel Regent Alusair Obarskyr assigned Lord Falzo Hawklin to resolving the situation. He in turn hired trustworthy adventurers, who delved the ruins and discovered the presence of a large portal network tied to the ruins of Blister.
