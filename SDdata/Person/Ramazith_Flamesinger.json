        "mainbody": "Ramazith Flamesinger was a sage in Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nRamaziths area of expertise was in marine life, both botany and zoology, and especially sea herbs and ixitxachitl and other intelligent marine creatures. Ramazith collaborated with fellow sages Alauthym of the Moonshae Isles and Nenemith to research the habits of ixitxachitl was ongoing in the 1350s DR. Often, sea captains of large fishing fleets consulted him about where they could find the best fishing spots, for particular species and at particular times.\nRamazith hailed from Durpar. He spent many years at sea, working as a sailor and becoming something of an expert in matters of the ocean. He turned to magic to further his own studies, and eventually became a skilled wizard. Never known as a wealthy man, he apparently discovered something extremely valuable in the ocean depths, because he was suddenly able to fund the construction of the lavish Ramaziths tower.\nHe abruptly disappeared one day. Although no one knew exactly what transpired, a popular rumor was that Ramazith had gotten romantically entangled with a nymph, leading to his demise.\nConsidered dashingly handsome, he had a lean and athletic body and a beard.\nRamazith was an excellent swimmer and diver, better than almost any other human. In his time, hed dived down to a number of deep sunken wrecks without any magical assistance.\nHe was also a great dancer.\nRamaziths wizard tower was a famous landmark in Baldurs Gate, though some regarded it as an eyesore. The six-story brick tower was built in the architectural style of his native Durpar, to remind him of home.\nPrior to his tower, Ramaziths home and office in Baldurs Gate was a rundown house near the Three Old Kegs inn, where he often went for evening meals.\nHe was also infamous as a local ladies man and some said Ramazith had killed some angry husbands in self-defense in his time. Others believed he was a Harper or an agent of the Red Wizards of Thay.\nSeveral times, Ramazith was observed speaking with elves whod just come from Evermeet, but he refused to talk about it with others."
