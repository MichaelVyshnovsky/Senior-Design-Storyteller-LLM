==Description==
Reagan was a large and muscular [[half-orcish]] woman. She had gray skin and fur and styles her hair into a red mohawk.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way and provoking fear and paranoia inside the city walls. Reagan was outraged by the number of public executions that took place on the plaza outside of the [[Basilisk Gate]]. She wrote to the [[Baldur's Mouth]] ''Gazette'' about the issue every [[tenday]] and every tenday, the [[broadsheet]] ignored the half-orc's calls. During that time, Reagan spent some time renting lodgings at [[Nortale's Hostel]] until an incident that had her removed from the reestablishment.
