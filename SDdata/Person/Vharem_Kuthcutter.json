When the group arrived in Waterdeep on [[Nightal]] 11, [[1479 DR]], Vharem died when he threw himself between enemies and Renaer in a successful attempt to save Renaer's life.\n\nVharem was granted the posthumous honor of being a member of the (unnamed) group of heroes that Renaer decided to form at [[Roarke House]] to serve a similar function to that of the [[Moonstars]].",
