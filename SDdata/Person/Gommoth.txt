'''Gommoth the Twisted''' was the self-proclaimed king of that [[cult of Maegera|cult of fire-worshiping creatures]] that lived within [[Mount Hotenow]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The mad [[fire giant]] was born with a distinct hunch in his back, causing him to stoop lower than his fellow kin and appear much more like a giant [[dwarf]]. He was ostracized from his giant community.

==Personality==
Despite his years living in exile, Gommoth had developed quite the charismatic personality and had trained himself well in the art of diplomacy.

Due to the unexplained voices he heard, Gommoth was said to be inflicted with some form of madness. It was believed by some the words he heard were actually the whisperings of the sleeping fire [[primordial]] [[Maegera]].

==Activities==
Gommoth's influence led his fellow fire giants to once-again worship Maegera, believing the primordial's power would allow them to form a new empire for themselves in [[the North]].

==Relationships==
Gommoth attracted a number of individuals with affinities to flame to joined his cause, including General [[Ignazar]], the powerful [[fire archon]] that took over the abandoned [[Fireguard Fortress]], fire giant commanders [[Kromar]] and [[Grumthrox]], the mercenary-giant swordswoman [[Pyraphenia]], and even the great [[red dragon]], [[Karrundax]]. 

They even managed to bring on a [[Shadovar]] mage by the name of [[Qalthus]].

==History==
He lived in exile on Mount Hotenow, alongside many other fire-attuned creatures, such as [[salamander]]s, fire archons, [[flame sprite]]s, and [[magma brute]]s. When the long-dormant volcano erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, many of these beings experienced an overwhelming feelings of transcendent euphoria if only for a few fleeting moments. Feeling as though they had fully connected to the element of fire itself, they fervently sought to recreate that spiritual sensation.

Following this cataclysmic event, Gommoth rallied the fire-worshiping beings as his new followers, and ventured deeper into Mount Hotenow to learn more about the enlightening experience they shared. The group discovered that beneath the caldera of Mount Hotenow lay the slumbering entity that caused their great spiritual awakening: the primordial Maegera. Gommoth and his followers sought to fully reawaken the slumbering primordial so that it might set all of [[Faer√ªn]] ablaze. His dedication was so fierce and his stature so powerful that fire giants from his former community even joined his cause.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Gommoth's forces came into conflict with the [[dwarves]] of the [[Clan Hillborn|Hillborn]] expedition, that ventured into Mount Hotenow to learn more about their ancestral origins and the volcano's great erupted some 30 years earlier. Once they learned of Gommoth's plans, they enlisted what aid they could to prevent another disastrous event. 

Ultimately, the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] ventured into the [[Temple of the Primordial]], killing Gommoth and his minions, and ending the menace of Maegera.
