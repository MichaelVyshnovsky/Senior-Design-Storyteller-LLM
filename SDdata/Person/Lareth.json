He was known for his ability to pull valuable wisdom from even the most trivial statements or writings. He liked to remain in his gold dragon form most of the time, but when needed to change into another form, he preferred that of an elf.\nLareth was the most trusted comrade of the gold dragon Protanther. and Tamarand, considering the latter to be his brother.\nNobody knew exactly where Lareths lair was located, but it was believed that it was somewhere in the Great Desert, or in the Elven Woods near Myth Drannor, or on a magically concealed island in the Dragonmere. Only gold dragons knew for sure, but they didnt reveal this information to non-gold dragons.\nAt some point prior 1357 DR,\nIn the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, Lareth was corrupted by the Rage while trying to protect other metallic dragons followers of Bahamut from the effects of the Dracorage.\nSome believed that Lareths spirit lingered on in Faer√ªn after his death.\nAfter Lareths death, magical daggers were made from his fangs. Called a dragontooth of Lareth, these daggers were given to elite members of the Talons of Justice, and were supposed to contain a part of the wisdom of the former King of Justice."
