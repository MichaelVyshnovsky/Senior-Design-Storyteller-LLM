'''Baram Hannikar''' was a fearsome warrior who sought out new foes to slay in the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was a well-built man who wore a thick beard and a shaved head, with a thin strip of hair down the middle.

==Abilities==
When he established himself at the siege camp outside [[Helm's Hold]], he operated as a bounty master, offering rewards to the adventurers that aided the [[Neverwinter Guard]] in retaking the city.

==Possessions==
Baram wore leader armor that featured great big spikes on the right pauldron.

==History==
Some time before the ''[[Siege of Helm's Hold]]'', ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Baram traveled to the Sword Coast from Impiltur to hunt down evil creatures like [[werewolves]] and [[demon]]s. During the siege, Baram was ensnared by the Prophet Rohini and held within the [[Cathedral of Helm]], alongside Captain [[Dunfield]] and Brother [[Satarin]]. The three men were rescued by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] when they stormed the cathedral and defeated the malevolent [[succubus]].
