        "History": "In [[1361 DR]], Mixtal and the [[Jaguar Knights|Jaguar Knight]] [[Gultec]] were tasked by [[Nexal]] high priest [[Hoxitl]] with the mission to capture and to kill [[Erixitl]] from the local temple of [[Qotal]], despite Mixtal's fear of reprisal.\n\nThey managed to kidnap the girl without anyone's notice, but when Mixtal was ready to deliver the mortal blow, they all saw the arrival of the [[Golden Legion]]'s ships. Erixitl profited from their distraction and escaped, injuring Mixtal's eyes in the process.\n\nHe and his student, [[Atax]], hunted for Erixitl in the jungle behind the pyramid, gaining also the help of a column of warriors, but because of his poor eyesight and a hidden [[spell]] by [[Chitikas]], Mixtal captured and sacrificed not Erixitl but [[Martine (Golden Legion)|Martine]], the daughter of [[Domincus]], the cleric of the [[Golden Legion]].\n\nSoon, however, the pyramid was attacked by a squad of legionaries led by [[Daggrande]] and guided by  Erixitl, causing Mixtal to go into confusion about how the girl was live again and why the strangers were attacking him. At this point, one of the [[Ancient Ones]], [[Spirali]], appeared and killed Mixtal for failing at his task."
