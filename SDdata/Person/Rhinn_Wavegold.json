        "mainbody": "King '''Rhinn Wavegold''' \"the Pious\" was the third [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Wavegold]] dynasty, who ruled in the 12{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Rhinn was the first son of King [[Belhinn Wavegold I|Belhinn I]], and the brother of [[Erdhinn Wavegold II|Erdhinn II]].",
        "History": "King Rhinn sponsored public religious works in Amn and had great personal interest in matters of faith, going so far as to mandate daily prayers to the gods for his subjects. His influence led to the creation of the many temples and shrines in [[Esmeltaran]], though most of them fell out of use once his reign ended. He was eventually assassinated by [[Church of Bane|Banite]] agents in the {{YearlinkName|1193}}, putting his brother Erdhinn on the throne."
