Zar-Dandan, who was also called the Wanderer or Gold-Teeth, was a half-elven traveler in the Hordelands in 1367 DR.
Zar-Dandan earned his nickname of Gold-Teeth for the many gold-capped teeth lining his mouth.
Though roguish, Zar-Dandan was charming and likable. He enjoyed sharing entertaining stories with fellow travelers, so long as they had nothing to do with his past, of which he was quite secretive.
Zar-Dandan owned a ring of jumping, a potion of fire resistance, and a magical sword and shield.
Zar-Dandans father was killed by a man named Rukn, whom he searched relentlessly for across the breadth of the Hordelands with the hopes of slitting his throat in his sleep.
