Zhentar began stealthily slaying the other merchants and replacing them with his own puppets. When Elephestron discovered what was happening he confronted Zhentar in a battle that resulted in both of their deaths. However, Zhentars seeds had already been planted and the settlement would later be named in his honor.\nBefore his death Zhentar also introduced the worship of Bane to the city."
