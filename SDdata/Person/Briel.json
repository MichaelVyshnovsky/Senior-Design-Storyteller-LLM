        "mainbody": "Briel, known as the Archmage Briel, was a human wizard of the 14 century DR.\nBriel was once an apprentice studying under the notorious lich Aumvor the Undying.\nHe once made plans to found a school of wizardry in Baldurs Gate,Champions of Ruins page 176 says Aumvors plan to create schools of wizardry was \"largely\" a \"spectacular failure\", suggesting Briels School of the Arcane failed somehow. No such school has been mentioned in sources on Baldurs Gate.\nHe was the father of Brielbara, a wizardess of Baldurs Gate known for developing many new spells around 1358 DR.\nBriels personal memoirs were titled A Life Lived in the Shadows of Death. Notably covering his time with Aumvor, the little that was known about the Undying One after the fall of Netheril was written down in these memoirs. They were kept in Brielbaras library in Baldurs Gate by 1374 DR.\nThe untitled wizards workbook known traditionally as Briels Book of Shadows was believed to be authored by Briel, written while studying under Aumvor. Some time before 1356 DR, the sage Ubergast observed that the informal handwriting in the book matched that in a letter from Briel stating his plan to found a school of wizardry in Baldurs Gate, preserved in the citys archive.\nIn his writings, Briel recorded the secret of the creation of living zombies—living beings cruelly reduced to a mindless, almost undead state and favored servitors of Aumvor the Undying—but Briel never created any himself."
