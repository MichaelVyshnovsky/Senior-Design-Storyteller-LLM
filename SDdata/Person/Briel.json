        "mainbody": "'''Briel''', known as '''the Archmage Briel''', was a [[human]] [[wizard]] of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Briel was once an apprentice studying under the notorious [[lich]] [[Aumvor|Aumvor the Undying]].\n\nHe once made plans to found a school of wizardry in [[Baldur's Gate]],<ref group=\"note\">''Champions of Ruins'' page 176 says Aumvor's plan to create schools of wizardry was \"largely\" a \"spectacular failure\", suggesting Briel's School of the Arcane failed somehow. No such school has been mentioned in sources on Baldur's Gate.",
        "Relations": "He was the father of [[Brielbara]], a [[wizard]]ess of Baldur's Gate known for developing many new [[spell]]s around [[1358 DR]].",
        "Publications": "Briel's personal memoirs were titled ''[[A Life Lived in the Shadows of Death]]''. Notably covering his time with Aumvor, the little that was known about the Undying One after the fall of [[Netheril]] was written down in these memoirs. They were kept in Brielbara's library in Baldur's Gate by [[1374 DR]].\n\nThe untitled [[spellbook|wizard's workbook]] known traditionally as ''[[Briel's Book of Shadows]]'' was believed to be authored by Briel, written while studying under Aumvor. Some time before [[1356 DR]], the sage [[Ubergast]] observed that the informal handwriting in the book matched that in a letter from Briel stating his plan to found a school of wizardry in Baldur's Gate, preserved in the city's archive.\n\nIn his writings, Briel recorded the secret of the creation of [[living zombie]]s—living beings cruelly reduced to a mindless, almost undead state and favored servitors of Aumvor the Undying—but Briel never created any himself."
