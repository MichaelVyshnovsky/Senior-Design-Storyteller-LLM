Url disliked drow and duergar. He deeply regretted how his life was ruined by the evil Red Wizard.
Around 1479 DR, Url and his lover were captured by a Red Wizard of Thay. With the life of his lover in the wizards hands, the wizard commanded Url to go to Mantol-Derith to sell weapons and collect information.
