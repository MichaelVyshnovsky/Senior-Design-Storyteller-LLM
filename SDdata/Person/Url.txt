Url was a dwarven blacksmith and merchant in Mantol-Derith.
Url usually sold weapons.
Url disliked drow and duergar. He deeply regretted how his life was ruined by the evil Red Wizard.
Around 1479 DR, Url and his lover were captured by a Red Wizard of Thay. With the life of his lover in the wizards hands, the wizard commanded Url to go to Mantol-Derith to sell weapons and collect information.
