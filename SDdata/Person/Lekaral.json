        "mainbody": "Lekaral was a disgraced spellcaster and a member of a cell of the Cult of Reborn Flame, who lived in Tarmalune in 1479 DR.\nIn 1479 DR, Lekaral was conducting magical experiments to create a ritual that could awaken the primordial Achazar. Said experiments needed the blood of descendants of the dragon-steeds of Achazar, and such individuals were supposed to be living in Tarmalune at the time.\nAt some point before 1479 DR, Lekaral left Tarmalune because of some disagreements with his family, in search of his own destiny. He became a member of the Cult of Reborn Flame shortly thereafter. He rose through the ranks and was eventually sent back to Tarmalune to carry out a ritual in hopes of awakening the primordial Achazar.\nLekaral was eventually killed by a group of adventurers sent by Halagothra the Healer to stop him."
