'''Crispin Churlgo''' was one of many children of [[Millie Churlgo]] who produced the infamous [[Churlgo Cheese]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Crispin was fully absorbed by his work and preferred the company of his [[cheese]] vats to other people.

==History==
Crispin worked inside the farmhouse and tended the huge cheese vats of Churlgo's product.

Crispin, along with the rest of his family, moved their farm from the [[Dalelands]] to [[Daggerford]] following a nasty extortion business with the [[Iron Throne]]. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably not lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.
