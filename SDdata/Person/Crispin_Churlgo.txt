Crispin Churlgo was one of many children of Millie Churlgo who produced the infamous Churlgo Cheese in the Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Crispin was fully absorbed by his work and preferred the company of his cheese vats to other people.
Crispin worked inside the farmhouse and tended the huge cheese vats of Churlgos product.
Crispin, along with the rest of his family, moved their farm from the Dalelands to Daggerford following a nasty extortion business with the Iron Throne. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably not lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.
