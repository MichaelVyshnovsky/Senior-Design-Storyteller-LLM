'''Dunstun Forgebar''' was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] of [[Vergadain]] from [[Clan Forgebar]] of the [[Sword Mountains]]. He was a merchant and a member of the [[Council of Sparkling Stones]] in the city of [[Mirabar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Dunstun was a prominent member of the council in the mid-1360s DR,<ref group="note">While Dunstun is listed as a councilor in ''Volo's Guide to the North'', circa 1365 DR, he is not listed in ''The North'', circa 1370 DR. While the lists only give some "prominent" members of the 42-strong council, ''[[The Thousand Orcs]]'' mentions [[Agrathan Hardhammer]] is the only dwarf on the council, so Dunstun may have left the council or died between these dates.
