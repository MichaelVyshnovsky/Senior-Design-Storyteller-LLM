        "mainbody": "'''Ashtyrranthor''' was a [[red dragon]] ally of the [[githyanki]] in [[Stardock]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "History": "The githyanki [[knight]] [[Jerath]] once saved Ashtyrranthor's life when she was a [[wyrmling]].\n\nSometime in the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Al'chaia]] led a group of githyanki into the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] while tracking down a colony of [[mind flayer]]s in the level of [[Seadeeps]]. Upon discovery of the [[portal]] leading to [[Stardock]], they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche K'liir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected access to Stardock. Ashtyrranthor was the main red dragon of the group.",
        "Activities": "Ashtyrranthor usually patrolled outside Stardock or checked on the githyanki nursery.",
        "Relationships": "Ashtyrranthor was the mother of [[Infernexus]], [[Ashranthax]], [[Blazutranc]], [[Meteoranzym]], [[Smoakcant]], and [[Zolcharrx]]. She was a friend of the blind knight Jerath."
