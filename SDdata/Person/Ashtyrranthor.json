        "mainbody": "shtyrranthor was a red dragon ally of the githyanki in Stardock in the early 1490s DR.\nThe githyanki knight Jerath once saved Ashtyrranthors life when she was a wyrmling.\nSometime in the late 15 century DR, Alchaia led a group of githyanki into the Crystal Labyrinth while tracking down a colony of mind flayers in the level of Seadeeps. Upon discovery of the portal leading to Stardock, they converted the abandoned asteroid into a crèche for the breeding and training of young githyanki, which they named Crèche Kliir. The labyrinth was converted into a fortress from where they led attacks against the mind flayers and protected access to Stardock. Ashtyrranthor was the main red dragon of the group.\nAshtyrranthor usually patrolled outside Stardock or checked on the githyanki nursery.\nAshtyrranthor was the mother of Infernexus, Ashranthax, Blazutranc, Meteoranzym, Smoakcant, and Zolcharrx. She was a friend of the blind knight Jerath."
