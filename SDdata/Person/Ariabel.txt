Ariabel was a paladin devoted to the Bringer of the Dawn, Lathander, active sometime before the midâ€“14 century DR.
Ariabels most renowned deed was when she wielded her enchanted blade Harrower against vampire Zerafex. The blood-sucking undead assembled a number of spawn under her control at some point long before the  and Ariabel sought to end her reign of terror. Unfortunately, Ariabel perished in the battle and her corpse, as well as Harrower were left abandoned within Zerafexs crypt somewhere in Tethyr. Years later, a band of thieves found a way into Ariabels final resting place and recovered her famed blade.
