'''Ariabel''' was a [[paladin]] devoted to the Bringer of the Dawn, [[Lathander]], active sometime before the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ariabel's most renowned deed was when she wielded her [[enchanted]] blade ''[[Harrower]]'' against [[vampire]] [[Zerafex]]. The blood-sucking [[undead]] assembled a number of [[vampire spawn|spawn]] under her control at some point long before the {{Yearlink|1368}} and Ariabel sought to end her reign of terror. Unfortunately, Ariabel perished in the battle and her corpse, as well as ''Harrower'' were left abandoned within Zerafex's crypt somewhere in [[Tethyr]]. Years later, a band of thieves found a way into Ariabel's final resting place and recovered her famed blade.
