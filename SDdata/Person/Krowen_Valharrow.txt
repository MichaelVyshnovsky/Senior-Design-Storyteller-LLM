Krowen Valharrow was an archmage member of the Harpers in Everlund sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Krowen lived in Moongleam Tower with the company of dozens of tressym and a handful of apprentices. He offered to people that he liked to bequeath one (and only one) of his tressym.
Secretly Krowen managed a secret network of teleportation circles that connected Everlund to Yartar, Neverwinter, Loudwater, Mirabar and Waterdeep.
