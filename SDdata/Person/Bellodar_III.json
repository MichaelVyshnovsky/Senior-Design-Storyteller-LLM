He ruled over the kingdom from the Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR, to the Year of the Covenant, 673 DR.\nPrior to his ascension to the Golden Throne, Prince Bellodar was married to Princess Elthia of Chessagol.\nKing Bellodar III was the first monarch to set down a unified set of laws for Impiltur, known as the \"Kings Code\". These regulations were drawn from centuries of regional customs and practices that originated from the ancient tribes of Narfell.\nThe Kings Code remained the basis for the subsequent laws that were implemented in the realm of Impiltur and further altered by the royal dynasties that ruled in the following centuries.\nKing Bellodar III died in 673 DR of natural causes and was succeeded by his eldest son, Prince Morus."
