'''Feena Archwood''' was a natural [[werewolf]] and [[cleric]] of [[Sel没ne]]. In [[1373 DR]] she briefly served as Moonmistress of [[Moonshadow Hall]] and refounded the long-lost [[New Moon Pact]].

==Description==
She often chose to dress simply in light [[sandal]]s, a blue skirt of homespun wool, and a blouse of [[linen]] dyed yellow with yarrow. In [[wolf]] form, her pelt was russet, the same color as her hair. She wore a battered and scratched medallion with the silver symbol of Sel没ne.

==History==
Feena was the daughter of [[Maleva]]. Her mother, knowing that Feena was a werewolf, sent her to mother [[Dhauna Myritar]] at [[Moonshadow Hall]], a temple of Sel没ne in [[Yhaunn]], [[Sembia]]. At the temple, she was trained to control her inner wolf and to become an acolyte. In her stay at the temple, she met [[Mifano]], who was a novice and an acolyte with her, a young man with silvery hair who was extremely flirtatious.

==Powers==
When casting ''[[hold person]]'', she was known to use the phrase "Bright Lady of Night, stay his hand!" as the verbal component.
