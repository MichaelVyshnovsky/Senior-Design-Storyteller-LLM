        "Personality": "Vlaakith CLVII was primarily jealous and paranoid, willing to eat the souls of those who reached a certain level of strength, regardless of the kind, to secure her position and bolster her own personal strength. The insane lich sought to ascend to the ranks of divinity.",
        "Abilities": "{{Quote|Vlaakith is unity. Fear and beauty, life and unlife. Eyes like onyx, teeth like daggers. There is none more perfect.|[[Lae'zel]], regarding her queen.}}\n\nVlaakith CLVII was very knowledgeable in arcane, historic, planar, and religious matters. She was also a very capable [[alchemy|alchemist]]. Like any other wizard, she could create magical [[scroll]]s, as well as [[ring]]s and [[magical item|wondrous item]]s. Her skill at the last exceeded mortal levels. The Lich Queen was trained in the usage of a [[silver sword]].\n\nShe had the abilities of a fully developed githyanki and most of the basic [[lich]] abilities. She was also a powerful [[wizard]] who trained herself in the arts of [[necromancy]] and [[transmutation]] in particular. Her spellcasting could exceed normal limits and was specifically tuned to punch through her targets' resistance against [[magic]]. Her ability to maintain spellcasting in adverse situations was tremendous as was her general spellcasting skill. She also had some skill at [[metamagic]], namely to enhance effectiveness and duration. The former was normally used to enhance ''[[circle of death]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[horrid wilting]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', ''[[time stop]]'', and ''[[vampiric touch]]'' [[spell]]s, while she used the latter to extend her ''[[dominate monster]]'', ''[[eyebite]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[heroism]]'', and ''[[spectral hand]]'' spells.\n\nOther spells she normally used included ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[contagion]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[dimensional anchor]]'', ''[[change self|disguise self]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[dismissal]]'', ''[[displacement]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', ''[[foresight]]'', ''[[gate]]'', ''[[greater dispel magic]]'', ''[[greater teleport]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[magic circle against good]]'', ''[[magic jar]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[touch of idiocy]]'', ''[[true seeing]]'', ''[[wail of the banshee]]'',  ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[waves of exhaustion]]'', ''[[waves of fatigue]]'', ''[[web]]'', ''[[wish]]'', and other more common and practical spells.\n\nShe was weak against harm that came from light.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Vlaakith CLVII 5e.png|thumb|''Vlaakith CLVII in [[Baldur's Gate III]].'']]\nVlaakith CLVII owned a large number of powerful [[magic item]]s. Among them were ''[[bracers of armor|+8 bracers of armor]]'', a ''[[cloak of charisma|+6 cloak of charisma]]'', a ''+5 [[dancing (weapon quality)|dancing]] [[vorpal]] [[silver sword]]'', a ''[[headband of intellect|+6 headband of intellect]]'', a ''[[ring of protection|+4 ring of protection]]'', a ''[[ring of wizardry|ring of wizardry IV]]'', a ''[[robe of eyes]]'', and scrolls of ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[protection from spells]]'', ''[[shapechange]]'', and ''[[time stop]]''. Two [[artifact]]s, which she always carried with herself, were the ''[[crown of corruption]]'' and the ''[[scepter of Ephelomon]]''.",
        "Activities": "The last queen of the githyanki, Vlaakith CLVII, died after ascending the throne without giving birth to an heir, but returned as a lich, thus remaining the ruler of the githyanki for over a thousand years. Her home, Castle [[Susurrus (Tu'narath)|Susurrus]], was located in the Queen's District of the githyanki capital city, [[Tu'narath]], which was built on the corpse of a deceased power known only as \"[[The One in the Void]]\".\n\nThe basis of the Vlaakith line's claim on power was a supposed blood relationship with Gith.\n\nOne of the queen's jobs was to decide whether every visitor to Tu'narath should be granted a visa or not. However, Vlaakith CLVII delegated this duty of hers to lesser generals.",
        "Relationships": "{{quote|I'll say this for Vlaakith: she knows how to build fanatics. But alas, fanatics are good for nothing of lasting consequence.\n|[[Mordenkainen]]\n}}\nVlaakith CLVII had a number of [[red dragon]]s under her service. These red dragons feared her so much that they would continue to serve her even if the ''scepter of Ephelomon'' would be destroyed.",
        "Worshipers": "{{Quote|Tl'a'vlaakith, chyrki. Tl'a'vlaakith, tavki. Tl'a'vlaakith, lash'a'kla.|A basic prayer to the Undying Queen.}}",
        "History": "Vlaakith was the name of many rulers of the githyanki race after the disappearance of [[Gith]], the rebel leader that united them against the [[illithid]]s. The original holder, [[Vlaakith I]] helped seal the pact between the red dragons and the githyanki. All subsequent queens of the githyanki were named after her.\n\nVlaakith CLVII stood out among the Vlaakiths for becoming a lich. Her undying reign and her success at getting rid of those who could challenge her were why she managed to retain her throne for longer than any other Vlaakith.\n\nAfter centuries of [[undeath]], she grew mad. She came up with an idea to become a [[deity]] and started to install a priest caste in githyanki society. She also sent loyal lieutenants to quell any unrest that might arise. These were done to gradually prepare for her ascension and encourage the githyanki to worship her as a deity. An inquisitor caste to hunt down people whom she wanted gone also existed. However, many githyanki viewed her as a mad tyrant who would cause their people's destruction or enslavement at her hands even before she reached her goal.\n\nIn the late 15th century DR, Vlaakith dispatched a force of githyanki warriors under the leadership of Inquisitor [[W'wargaz]] to [[Toril]] in search of the [[Astral Prism]], an artefact of immense power that had been stolen by worshippers of [[Shar]]."
