Nada, also known as Juto, was a yakuza in the town of Aru in Wa in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar.
In battle, Nada used a ninja-to.
He was proficient in games.
His profession was something of an open secret to the people of Aru, but none knew where he lived or operated out of.
In the , Nada was ordered by the local yakuza family to discourage an adventuring party hired by the daimyo, Benju Matsutomo. Calling himself Juto and contriving to bump into them in the street, Nada would idly tell the adventurers that bad karma would come to them if they continued their investigation. It was not meant as a threat, but as a helpful warning.
