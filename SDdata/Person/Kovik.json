        "mainbody": "Princeps Kovik was a chain devil warlord in Avernus in the late 15 century DR.\nAlthough particularly cruel, Kovik was a capable leader who had gained the trust of its subordinates.\nThe Princeps rode a Devils Ride infernal war machine.\nKovik once commanded the 8th Infantry Legion of the Nine Hells, nicknamed \"Terror Incarnate\". After a crushing defeat in battle against the demon lord Kostchtchie on the banks of the Styx, Kovik blamed his superiors. The chain devil commander gathered the surviving members of the 8th Legion and renounced the infernal hierarchy, forming the marauder gang known as the Eighth Remnant.\nKoviks ultimate goal was to gather enough military strength to drive the demons out of Avernus forever. Many disenfranchised devils sympathized with this goal, and so flocked to join the Eighth Remnant."
