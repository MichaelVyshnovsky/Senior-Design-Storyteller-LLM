        "mainbody": "Zeltabbar Iliphar was a human sage inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nZeltabbars areas of expertise as a sage included human languages, legends, and folklore and, to a lesser degree, the planes of existence. He understood a great number of human languages, as well as Dwarvish and Elvish.\nZeltabbar was highly intelligent, but completely deaf. Nevertheless, he could read lips without error and understood many human languages, as well as Dwarvish and Elvish. He was able to speak, but regularly wrote his replies on slate boards, and he had many to hand in his office.\nHe lived in a row house on Nephranters Street on the northwest side of the Court of the White Bull, located in the southern section of Waterdeeps Trades Ward. His office lay on the ground floor.\nHe had two daughters, described as lovely, who helped him manage his library."
