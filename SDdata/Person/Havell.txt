'''Havell''' was a merchant in [[Shussel]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Havell was unveiled as a fraud by a foreign merchant (probably from [[Durpar]]).

In 1357 DR, Havell discovered a cache of magic potions that enabled him to turn ethereal for a time while wielding a non-ethereal object. He used those potions to start a killing spree among the foreign merchants of the city.

==Personality==
Havell hated all foreigners after his humiliation.
