Havell was a merchant in Shussel in 1357 DR.
Havell was unveiled as a fraud by a foreign merchant (probably from Durpar).
In 1357 DR, Havell discovered a cache of magic potions that enabled him to turn ethereal for a time while wielding a non-ethereal object. He used those potions to start a killing spree among the foreign merchants of the city.
Havell hated all foreigners after his humiliation.
