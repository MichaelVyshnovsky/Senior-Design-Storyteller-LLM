'''Ahri "Golemkin"''' was an artificer and an engineer from [[Lantan]] who work in the illegal logging camp in [[Samarach]] by the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Every time! Reliable as clockwork, because they're clockwork themselves - on their mother's side, that is. Ha! Small joke! ...But yes, they're loyal, wonderful things.''|Ahri "Golemkin", talking bout her [[golem]]s}}

==Description==
Ahri was a young diminutive [[gnome|gnomish]] woman who wore brightly-colored cacophonous outfits stained with [[ink]] and grease. Her personality could be described as eccentric and absentminded. She constantly mumbled to herself as her mind birthed new plans and inventions.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Ahri "Golemkin" could be found by the ''Lantan-Samarach portal'' in the jungles of the [[Samarlogh]]. She arrived at the logging camp from [[Lantan]] and brought along her vast arsenal of [[construct]]s she referred to as her "marvelous friends." These constructs included Lantanese [[iron golem]]s, Lantanese [[blade spider]]s, and [[clockroach]]es. Her supervisor â€“ [[Dall Nickleplate]], was an angry individual who forbade the young gnome to sell her constructs to the camp's sporadic visitors.

Ahri "Golemkin" was present at the logging camp when it became plagued by misfortunes, and its hefty logging machines mysteriously moved across the camp at night, leaving no tracks in the dirt. She also was present during the death of engineer [[Tamith Timekeep]] and poisoning, as well as the ''portal's'' sabotage by a [[yuan-ti]] spy named [[Luaire Farwander]].

Soon after, Ahri started noticing that her golems started to "misbehave." A handful of her clockroaches inexplicably ran away. "Golemkin" asked a group of adventurers to collect pieces of malfunctioning clockroaches so she could study them and determine the cause of the strange behavior. She offered a ''[[collapsable clockroach]]'' as the reward.
