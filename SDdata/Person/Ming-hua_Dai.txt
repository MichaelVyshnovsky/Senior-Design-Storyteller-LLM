Ming-hua Dai was a ghostly sorcerer lieutenant who served Nan Kung Chi in the Crypt of Durkon in Kara-Tur in the 14 century DR.
In his life and during the undead existence, Ming-hua Dai was adorned in a purple mages robe and was armed with simple darts and a quarterstaff.
Dais sorcerous gift allows him to weave many powerful arcane spells, including power word, stun, pierce magic, chain lightning, breach, stoneskin, and many others.
Ming-hua Dai died many moons before the late 14 century DR. In life, he was a human spell-slinger and one of six trusted lieutenants who served Nan Kung Chi. He continued to do the same long after death. In the , the crypt faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon. The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypts dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard. At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master Larloch, who sought the tombs magical treasure. A ghostly monk named Ki Chin Sang stood guard of Nan Kung Chis tomb and demanded anyone seeking entrance to defeat six of Nan Kung Chis trusted undead lieutenants who all were interred together. When Hexxat and her allies challenged the lieutenants to battle, Ming-hua Dai was joined by Weimin Min, Yi Niu, Borok-Tosst, and Jiang Dai, and, presumably, was defeated.
