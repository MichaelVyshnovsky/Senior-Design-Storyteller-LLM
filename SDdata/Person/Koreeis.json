        "mainbody": "oreeis was a powerful lamia noble sorcerer who led their proud clan of lamias in the desert of Anauroch during the 14 century DR.\nOne day, Koreeis and their lamias overstepped their bounds and wandered into the territory of the Bedine tribe led by the Sheik Jolarr. As they retreated from the desert raiders, the group of magical beasts found themselves in the ruins of the Netherese demesne of Hlaungadath, a site of evil repute. Trapped between the ruins to the north and the Bedine to the south, Koreeis and their clan were forced to head north, where the leader discovered a shimmering, iridescent portal within the ancient temple of Mystryl.\nSince this discovery, Koreeis began focusing his clans raids in the hopes of recovering a spellbook, or abducting a wizard, that could shed more light upon the magical portcullis."
