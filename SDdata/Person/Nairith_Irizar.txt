Nairith Irizar was an archmage and the sultan of the city of Volothamp in the early 14 century DR.
Around 1357 DR, the galleys of Volothamp accidentally attacked a ship of Waterdeep while engaging pirates off the coast of Tethyr. As reparations for his citys mistake, Nairith Irizar traveled to the city of Waterdeep and gifted a valuable magic gem, The Kiss of the Goddess, to Piergeiron the Paladinson the Open Lord of Waterdeep.
Nairiths gifting of the gem was treated to a big ceremony at Piergeirons Palace that was attended by Piergeiron himself, Madeiron Sunderstone, Rulathorn, and several of the citys prominent wizards. The wizards in attendance included Khelben Arunsun, Maskar Wands, Nain Keenwhistler, and allegedly Malchor Harpell.
