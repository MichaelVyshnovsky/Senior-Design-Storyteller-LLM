Vassk was an ophidian bodyguard once in the service of House Eselemas.
Vassk served Sasyk Vatoros of House Eselemas in Lushpool until the yuan-ti was caught trading magical secrets to rivals of House SeSehen, forcing both of them to flee for their lives. Assassins from the Eselemaa found the pair near Hlondeth and were able to kill Sasyk before Vassk could chase them off. With the death of his patron, Vassk was in search of another yuan-ti to serve.
Vassk wielded an enchanted greatsword and wore enchanted chainmail. He also carried a composite longbow and some arrows enchanted with frost magic.
