'''Vassk''' was an [[ophidian]] bodyguard once in the service of [[House Eselemas]].

==Activities==
Vassk served [[Sasyk Vatoros]] of House Eselemas in [[Lushpool]] until the [[yuan-ti]] was caught trading magical secrets to rivals of [[House Se'Sehen]], forcing both of them to flee for their lives. [[Assassin]]s from the Eselemaa found the pair near [[Hlondeth]] and were able to kill Sasyk before Vassk could chase them off. With the death of his patron, Vassk was in search of another yuan-ti to serve.

==Possessions==
Vassk wielded an enchanted [[greatsword]] and wore enchanted [[chainmail]]. He also carried a [[composite longbow]] and some [[arrow]]s enchanted with frost [[magic]].
