        "mainbody": "iftel Farsight was a half-elf mage who lived in the city of Neverwinter during the late 15 century DR.\nAs part of her scholarly pursuits, Riftel studied elemental weevils that she found on the slopes of Mount Hotenow.\nRiftel had an assistant named Gerad Kinesward, whom she tasked with her more mundane activities. She felt Gerad would do well to gain some real-life experience and learn to get herself out of difficult situations such as those she sent her into.\nFollowing the siege of Neverwinter, in the , Riftel set herself up at an outpost of the Neverwinter Guard in the River District, which had been taken over by the Many-Arrows orcs. Riftel wanted to begin a parlay with Hulgen, the leader of the Proudfist half-orc tribe, and convince them to side with Neverwinter over the kingdom of Many-Arrows. However, she felt her shyness dealing with them made her appear weak and distrusted, so she requested a half-elf adventurer to find and negotiate with them.\nMeanwhile, Riftel lost six of her elemental weevils and naturally sent Gerad to recover them, though she became frightened and hid amidst the orc camp."
