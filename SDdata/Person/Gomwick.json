        "History": "Gomwick was killed in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when delivering a bag of letters to [[Baldur's Gate]]. He was slain by a pack of [[gnoll]]s associated with the [[Cult of the Absolute]] that attacked travelers along the [[Risen Road]], and his body remained in the nearby forest. Scratch remained by his side for some time, sure that his friend would wake up soon.\n\n[[Danzo Arkwright]], Gomwick's employer, sent out a carrier [[pigeon]] with a warning letter to Gomwick, telling him to be careful as there had been attacks and murders on the roads outside of Baldur's Gate. The letter never reached the courier."
