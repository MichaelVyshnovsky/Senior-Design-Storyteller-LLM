        "Activities": "Corkin was an able smith and rumormonger, selling arms and armors to the city's army and navy and also to the nobles' private armies. He was very able to adjust his offers to the current political climate. Thanks to his contacts, he always had very good information that he used to gain better contacts or to sell the best goods. Corkin also managed a courier service. To create magic weapons, he worked with the [[dwarf]] [[wizard]] [[Theoderus]]. Often, Corkin also acted as an intermediary between noble houses and their hired sellswords."
