Tathla "Flamehair" Nightstar was a famous courtesan of Calimport and later proprietor of the Purple Palace festhall in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 1360s DR.
She became famous as a courtesan in Calimport in Calimshan in the mid-1330s DR. At one point, she was also an adventurer, but later retired from that life.
By the mid-1360s DR, Flamehair Nightstar was owner of the Purple Palace and was considered one of the shrewdest investors in the city at the time. She was also a friend to goodhearted adventurers.
Even thirty years later, Tathla was considered a great beauty. She was nicknamed "Flamehair" for her blood-red hair, which was so long it enveloped her like a cloak and trailed over the ground behind her.
