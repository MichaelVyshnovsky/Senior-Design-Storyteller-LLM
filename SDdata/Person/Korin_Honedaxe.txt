'''Korin Honedaxe''' was a revered [[dwarf|dwarven]] mother and a protector of [[Myth Drannor]] who died long before the advent of the [[Weeping War]].

==Possessions==
Korin possessed a unique [[enchanted]] [[warhammer]] - the ''[[Sunderstone]]''.

==History==
After her death, Korin Honedaxe was interred, along with her powerful magical weapon, within a dwarven tomb complex deep within the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The dead hero was still undisturbed as of [[1369 DR]], guarded by dwarven statues - [[iron golem]]s, and protective magics of the tombs that allowed those on need to claim weapons of fallen heroes and unleashed incorporeal [[undead]] on grave robbers.
