'''Belmurl''' was a caravan guard in the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Belmurl was one of [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s guards during the voyage from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] late in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}. He was badly injured, perhaps mortally during the first ambush that struck the caravan after leaving Scornubel. Orthil was informed of this just after learning that [[Horlo]] had perished.
