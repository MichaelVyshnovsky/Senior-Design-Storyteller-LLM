'''Vendes Baenre''', nicknamed '''''Duk-Tak''''' ("Unholy Executioner") was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] of [[House Baenre]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the fourth of Matron Mother [[Yvonnel Baenre]]'s daughters and also the master tormentress of the Baenre compound; her nickname was because of this "job".

==History==
Vendes Baenre tortured [[Drizzt]] when he returned to [[Menzoberranzan]] and was captured by House Baenre. She was later killed by Drizzt when [[Cattie-brie]] and [[Artemis Entreri]] rescued him from the Baenre compound. in [[1357 DR]].

==Personality==
Small of stature, Vendes was vicious and uncontrollably volatile, so much so that Yvonnel refused to grant her a room in the highest tier of the Baenre stalagmite. Since even an [[illithid]] was permitted to dwell there, this slight only shortened Vendes's temper.

==Activities==
However, Yvonnel had some use for her daughter, sending Vendes to  mete out punishment to lower-ranking drow.

Vendes wielded a unique seven-headed ''[[whip of fangs]]'' that could turn the skin of its victims into [[ebony]]. Yvonnel stored the resulting statues in a room for later sale.

Yvonnel let her daughter also punish priestesses in [[Arach-Tinilith]]. If a would-be priestess was believed to be straying from the Way of [[Lolth]], Vendes was put to work on them. Their ebony statues were displayed in front of Arach-Tinilith for one year as a warning to all.

Vendes's "statues" of drow were prized by the elite of [[Gracklstugh]], although after her death several statues mysteriously came to life and attacked their owners.
