Sallinithyl was a sahuagin priestess of Sekolah in the City of Caverns in the midâ€“14 century DR, and the daughter of the royal high priestess, Senityili.
The senior priestess was very ambitious, and believed in blood purity amongst her kin, and would kill to keep their bloodline strong.
Around 1369 DR, Sallinithyl advised and served the rebel prince, Villynaty, in a time of civil war. The priestess believed that only the prince could save them from growing weak under King Ixilthetocal. She wished to succeed her mother as the highest-ranking priestess in the City of Caverns.
