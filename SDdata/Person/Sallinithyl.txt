'''Sallinithyl''' was a [[sahuagin]] [[priestess]] of [[Sekolah]] in the [[City of Caverns]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], and the daughter of the royal high priestess, [[Senityili]].

==Description==
The senior priestess was very ambitious, and believed in blood purity amongst her kin, and would kill to keep their bloodline strong.

==History==
Around [[1369 DR]], Sallinithyl advised and served the rebel prince, [[Villynaty]], in a time of civil war. The priestess believed that only the prince could save them from growing weak under King [[Ixilthetocal]]. She wished to succeed her mother as the highest-ranking priestess in the City of Caverns.
