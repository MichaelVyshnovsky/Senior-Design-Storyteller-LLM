Fargus was a cleric and slave of Baeloth Barrityl.
The elf was a minor cleric, who fought with a flail. He wore chain mail, a helmet and a large shield. The cleric also carried a potion of healing and an antidote.
Fargus and his party were taken from a "shabby saloon" to the Black Pits. They were killed by the Champion of Baeloths Pits and their party in the Black Pits arena.
