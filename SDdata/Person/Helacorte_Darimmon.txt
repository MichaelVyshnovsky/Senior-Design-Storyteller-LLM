'''Talatha Vaerovree''' was a spellslayer and a short-lived [[Magister]] in {{yearlink|1385}}. She was the last Magister until the [[Second Sundering]].{{cite web/theedverse/2022-05-25 - Magister and the Spellplague}}

==Activities==
She was an accomplished spellslayer.

==History==
Helacorte accepted the mantle of the Magister from a manifestation of [[Azuth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, shortly before the onset of the [[Spellplague]]. She spent less than a [[tenday]] as the Magister; she went insane upon the death of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], and then her head exploded.

==Rumors==
Per [[Elminster]], Helacorte was offered the mantle by an Azuth who knew [[Mystra]]'s death was imminent, so that Helacorte's activities would cease.
