        "mainbody": "Tolgar Anuvien was a veteran member of the Company of Crazed Venturers who went on to found the abbey of Goldenfields in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nTolgar had a quick wit and rather dry sense of humor. He believed he was truly doing the work of Chauntea, the goddess whom he venerates, by founding and running the temple-complex of Goldenfields.\nTolgar was counted among the friends of Malchor Harpell.\nHe was considered an ally of the Harpers. In face they hid away some of his vast wealth in the Tower of Twilight, on the eastern side of the Neverwinter Wood.\nTolgar wielded a +3 mace, that he has dubbed Chaunteas Fire and Sword that possessed the ability to unleash fireballs and blade barriers once per day. He also carried dual rings of spell storing.\nTolgar Anuvien became a very wealthy man after his many years of adventuring. Tolgar gained great amounts of wealth that he has stored at his house in Waterdeep, the Dripping Dagger inn, and the homes of several friends, including the palace of Piergeiron, Open Lord of Waterdeep.\nThe 15 century paladin of Chauntea Kharissa Anuvien claimed that she was a descendent of the famous Chauntean adventurer."
