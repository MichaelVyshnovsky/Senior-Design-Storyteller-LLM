Pokoso was an intelligent Azuposi human sunwatcher who lived in Kin Elbhaz in the Pasocada Basin in Maztica.
The cleric was under-confident and felt he was not worthy of his position, and this affected his ability to pray for spells. This frustrated him a great deal, because he believed that the spirits were punishing him.
Pokoso carried a knife with him.
