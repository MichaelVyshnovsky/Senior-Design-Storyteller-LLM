Lord '''Ilsevele''' was the master of [[Tower Aerilpe]]. To [[Kiril Duskmourn]]'s recollection in {{yearlink|1375}}, he had shown sympathy to the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] in the past; she thought to inform him that the [[nilshai]] had decided to reveal themselves as agents of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. His tower was deserted as of that year, with the still rotting bodies of some of the guards around it.{{cite book/Stardeep|222|20}}
