Wesclodat the Aged was a human Deneiran priest of unknown origins.
In his old age, Wesclodat retained only thin whisps of long, white hair, and a similar beard. His robe was dyed deep blue.
Wesclodat kept a regular schedule, even as he grew old.
Among his possessions was a robe of blending.
None of Wesclodats peers knew his origins, but some elders claimed he had once followed a different god, swapping to Deneir as the result of a trade between the two deities.
