        "Description": "Bruha was a brown-eyes and light-skinned [[gold dwarf]] with her face splattered in freckles. She kept her face clean shaven and let her mane of red curly hair loose.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Bruha and her husband were faced with the dangers of increased crime and looming war. Thatmatt Oakhide was mugged twice in one month despite him always carrying a weapon and the [[Flaming Fist]] outpost in the [[Basilisk Gate]] did not bother to act on the couple's reports. Like so many commoners of the Gate, Bruha and Thatmatt were unable to leave the city."
