He had heavy eyelids; thick, full lips; and no beard or stubble, making his face look too clean and soft to be an adult's.<ref> Up until his death at the hands of [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], Ghost also used the body of the [[firbolg]] [[Vander]] to escape any dangerous situations and to perform his craft.<ref>",

The target's spirit would then leave the dead body, which could be reclaimed by Ghost's spirit after it was repaired by his ''[[ring of regeneration]]''.\n\nThe device was said to have been created in the lower planes millennia before it came to be found by Ghost.<ref>\n\n[[Cadderly Bonaduce]] finally destroyed the ''Ghearufu'' with the help of the [[red dragon]] [[Fyrentennimar]].<ref>",
            "''Ring of Regeneration''": "In order to use his own body again after killing it, Ghost used a ''ring of regeneration''. After the kill, the assassin would wait for the ring concealed in his boot to heal his original body. When it was alive again, he transferred back, leaving the target's empty body dead and unmarked.<ref>"
