        "mainbody": "Miraj Vizann was the second-in-command of the Cult of the Black Earth at the Temple of the Black Earth in Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nMiraj was a very rational and deliberate individual. He joined the earth cult only to deepen his understanding of elemental magic. He believed that enemies could be bribed or persuaded, such as to attack instead fire cultists. For his practice of both earth and water magic, Miraj called himself a \"mud sorcerer\". He was a perfectionist. He was so focused on his magical research that he had no interest in challenging Marlos Urnrayle for leadership.\nMiraj hailed from Calimshan.\nIn 1491 DR, Miraj oversaw the Black Earth temple in Tyar-Besil."
