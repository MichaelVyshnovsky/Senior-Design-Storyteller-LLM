        "Personality": "Miraj was a very rational and deliberate individual. He joined the earth cult only to deepen his understanding of [[elemental magic]]. He believed that enemies could be bribed or persuaded, such as to attack instead fire cultists. For his practice of both earth and water magic, Miraj called himself a \"mud sorcerer\". He was a perfectionist. He was so focused on his magical research that he had no interest in challenging [[Marlos Urnrayle]] for leadership.",
        "History": "Miraj hailed from [[Calimshan]].\n\nIn [[1491 DR]], Miraj oversaw the Black Earth temple in Tyar-Besil."
