Azaka was an experienced guide who knew the Chultan jungle well, from its dangerous predators to its medicinal [[plant]]s to its notable locales. She charged 5 [[gold pieces]] per day and required payment for 30 days in advance. Potential clients were known to be be able to find her near the gates to Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]].

==Relationships==
As a jungle guide, Azaka technically worked for the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]] [[Jobal]], and was required to pay him a portion of her income.

She owed a favor to Mother [[Sibonseni]].

Azaka knew [[Saja N'baza]], the [[guardian naga]] of [[Orolunga]].

==History==
{{Fq
| text = In Chult, the only foe whose strength you know is the foe you can see. 
| source = Azaka
}}
She was born in the jungles of Chult, as thus was well acquainted with its dangers.

At some point, her ''mask of the beast'' was stolen by the [[pterafolk]] of [[Firefinger]]. Eager to retrieve it, Azaka offered to waive her fee for any group of [[adventurer]]s who would help her get it back.

During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} she took on a job at the behest of Mother Sibonseni to lead a group of champions from [[Daggerford]] into the jungle as they investigated the cause and source of the curse. She led this group first along the [[River Soshenstar]] through [[Camp Righteous]] to [[Camp Vengeance]], where they assisted the beleaguered [[Order of the Gauntlet]], and from there they traveled through the [[Aldani Basin]] to [[Kir Sabal]]. After helping to defend the [[aarakocra]] of Kir Sabal, this group learned the location of the lost city of [[Omu]], and upon travelling there, they learned from [[Orvex Ocrammas]] about the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. Seeking to gain entrance to the Tomb brought them into conflict with the [[yuan-ti]] led by [[Ras Nsi]], and Azaka was ultimately captured by the yuan-ti, used as bait to draw out her clients, and then killed. Because of the death curse, her [[soul]] was siphoned away by the ''[[Soulmonger]]'', thus preventing her from being [[Raise dead|raised from the dead]]. However, following the destruction of the ''Soulmonger'', she was successfully brought back by the [[Sel√ªnite]] [[cleric]] [[Celeste]].
