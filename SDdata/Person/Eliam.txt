Eliam was a Netherese archwizard who lived during the Age of Discovery.
Eliam led the enclave some time after Requiar, who had been driven insane by the Crown of Horns in . Inhabitants of the enclave conducted a search for the ancient crown for over 150 years, to no avail. As the members of the enclave could not find the item, Eliam hired adventurers to conduct an outside-search in the Eastern Forest, though they too, were unsuccessful.
