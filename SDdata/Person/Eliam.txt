'''Eliam''' was a [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]] who lived during the [[Age of Discovery]].

==History==
Eliam led the enclave some time after [[Requiar]], who had been driven insane by the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' in {{YearlinkConvert|2651|NY}}. Inhabitants of the enclave conducted a search for the ancient crown for over 150 years, to no avail. As the members of the enclave could not find the item, Eliam hired adventurers to conduct an outside-search in the [[Eastern Forest]], though they too, were unsuccessful.
