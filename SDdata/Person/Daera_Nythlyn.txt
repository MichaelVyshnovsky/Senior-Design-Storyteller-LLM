Daera Nythlyn was a friendly skilled wizard and shopkeeper inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Daera was always surrounded by a dozen flying skeletal hands that hovered around her body.
She studied magic within her cottage in Tulmon. The door of the cottage was actually a guardian stone golem. Daera would cast spells for others if the price was right.
Once every dozen years or so Daera was visited by masked figures who arrived at night. Onlookers could see strange lights flashing within her cottage and accompanying small explosions. The cottage was usually closed for at least a month after the visitors left. It remained unclear who these visitors were.
