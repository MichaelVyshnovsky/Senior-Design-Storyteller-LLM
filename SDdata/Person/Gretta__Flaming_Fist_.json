        "Description": "Gretta was a [[gnome|gnomish]] woman with a big brown ponytail. She wore a set of [[splint mail]] adorned with a [[tabard]] that proudly displayed the Flaming Fist insignia.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fist Gretta was a member of a Flaming Fist troop that accompanied Counselor Florrick and Duke Ravengard on a mission to [[Elturel]]. They stopped at the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn, where they fell victim to the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s ambush in which Ulder Ravengard was kidnapped. Florrick and her Fists marched towards the [[Moonrise Towers]] to rescue the Duke but were waylaid by the dangers of the [[Shadow-cursed lands]]. Fist Gretta and the rest found shelter in the [[Last Light Inn]], where they met High Harper [[Jaheira]] and her [[Harper]]s, who sought to end the life of General [[Ketheric Thorm]], the leader of the Absolute's army.\n\nWhen a group of [[True Soul]]s arrived at the Last Light Inn, Gretta was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if she survived the war with the Absolute; she might had perished after the darkness consumed the Last Light Inn, or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign."
