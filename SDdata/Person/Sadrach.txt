Sadrach was a wizard who lived in Faerûn during the 14 and 15 centuries DR. He was a famous scholar of elemental magic, who dwelled within his own personal castle in south Faerûn.
He venerated the four elemental lords Akadi, Grumbar, Istishia, and Kossuth. He maintained four separate temples dedicated to each of them within his castle.
He was a confidant and learned man in life, who became filled with unrelenting rage while living in a cursed state of existence.
His only known relative was his daughter Gingrid, a young necromancer who was granted unnaturally long longevity and youth.
When the Spellplague struck Toril, in the , Sadrach believed his magic was strong enough to protect the people within his castle. Unfortunately he was wrong. Those who were not killed outright became inflicted with spellscars, or worse yet, were transformed into plaguechanged. 
Like many of his people, Sadrach was transformed into one of the "wallbound", unfortunate souls who became trapped within the structure of Sadrach Castle. He languished in this cursed state, as four stone faces and pairs of arms attached to the keep, filled with an uncontrollable fury for over a century.
During the events of the Second Sundering, in the final days of the , three of the gods chosen and shades from Netheril came into conflict at Sadrachs Spire, causing the castle to crash into ruin. Sadrach and the unfortunate wallbound were freed from their stony prison, left to return to their loved ones. He aged wizard was last heard crying out for joy, thanking the divine beings of the Realms for his freedom.
