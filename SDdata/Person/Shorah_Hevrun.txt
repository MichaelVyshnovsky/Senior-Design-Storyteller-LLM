Shorah Hevrun was a human girl in Elturel in the late 15 century DR.
When Elturel was transported to Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells, in the , the Hevrun family were killed in the transition, leaving Shorah the only survivor. Four ghasts entered the house to devour the dead while Shorah hid in a cupboard. Adventurers might slay the ghasts and find her, and Shorah would attach herself to whoever was kind to her and follow them to the High Hallâ€”if she was lucky.
