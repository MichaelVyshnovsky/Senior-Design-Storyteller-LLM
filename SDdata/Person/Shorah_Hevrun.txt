'''Shorah Hevrun''' was a [[human]] girl in [[Elturel]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When Elturel was transported to [[Avernus]], first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, the Hevrun family were killed in the transition, leaving Shorah the only survivor. Four [[ghast]]s entered the house to devour the dead while Shorah hid in a cupboard. Adventurers might slay the ghasts and find her, and Shorah would attach herself to whoever was kind to her and follow them to the [[High Hall (Elturel)|High Hall]]â€”if she was lucky.
