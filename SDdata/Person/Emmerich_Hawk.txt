Emmerich Hawk was a half-elven bowyer and ranger from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.
Emmerich had a distinctly elvish appearance. He was a slender man with a pale skin tone and brown hair. He was a religious man who worshiped the Forest Father and had no time for gossip.
Apart from regular bows, missiles, and weapons, Emmerich Hawk carried goblin arrows in stock, as well as a unique Talassan shortbow called the Storm Bow that came from the faraway Moonshae Isles.
In the , Emmerich resided in the town of Lonelywood, providing his skills to the locals, making and repairing bows, crossbows, fletching arrows and bolts, and sold mundane simple weapons. In his free time, Emmerich served as a self-proclaimed "caretaker" of the Lonelywood Forest that grew by the town. He made sure no local loggers nor hunters overstepped their bounds. Emmerich protected the forest, despite losing Silvanus favor and losing the deitys blessings, after three new residents came to Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the rangers rules. The trapping in Lonelywood Forest was out of control, and Emmerich was unable to stop them, earning the Oakfathers scorn. It manifested itself when Emmerich met a great white wolf in the forest- considered scared protectors by some. The wolf pounced at Emmerich before the ranger could react and sank its fangs deep into the flesh above the collar. Miraculously, the ranger managed to stab the beast with a dagger. it did not kill the white wolf, but it saved Emmerichs life. The ranger believed that his surviving the wolf, the Oakfathers vengeance, only angered the deity more.
