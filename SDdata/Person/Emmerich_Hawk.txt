'''Emmerich Hawk''' was a [[half-elven]] bowyer and [[ranger]] from the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''I'm a bowyer by trade. I craft bows for trade with the few caravans that find their way up here to Lonelywood. It's not much, but it's an honest living. Besides, it allows me the freedom to pursue my true calling.''|Emmerich Hawk}}

==Description==
Emmerich had a distinctly elvish appearance. He was a slender man with a pale skin tone and brown hair. He was a religious man who worshiped the Forest Father and had no time for gossip.

==Posessions==
Apart from regular bows, missiles, and weapons, Emmerich Hawk carried [[goblin arrow]]s in stock, as well as a unique [[Talassan]] [[shortbow]] called the ''[[Storm Bow]]'' that came from the faraway [[Moonshae Isles]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Emmerich resided in the town of Lonelywood, providing his skills to the locals, making and repairing [[bow]]s, [[crossbow]]s, fletching [[arrow]]s and [[bolt]]s, and sold mundane simple weapons. In his free time, Emmerich served as a self-proclaimed "caretaker" of the [[Lonelywood Forest]] that grew by the town. He made sure no local loggers nor hunters overstepped their bounds. Emmerich protected the forest, despite losing [[Silvanus]]' favor and losing the deity's blessings, after three new residents came to Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the ranger's rules. The trapping in Lonelywood Forest was out of control, and Emmerich was unable to stop them, earning the Oakfather's scorn. It manifested itself when Emmerich met a great white wolf in the forest- considered scared protectors by some. The wolf pounced at Emmerich before the ranger could react and sank its fangs deep into the flesh above the collar. Miraculously, the ranger managed to stab the beast with a [[dagger]]. it did not kill the white wolf, but it saved Emmerich's life. The ranger believed that his surviving the wolf, the Oakfather's vengeance, only angered the deity more.
