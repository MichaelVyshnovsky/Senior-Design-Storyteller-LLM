        "mainbody": "Harlyn Grimmerhand was a moneylender, and a retired adventurer from Daerlun who was also a member of the Men of the Basilisk, an all-male secret society. He was also an infiltrator in the Cult of the Dragon, where he had gained the rank of Wearer of Purple during the late 14 century DR.\nPublicly, Harlyn Grimmerhand bred horses and tutored warriors to entertain himself.\nHe had also been secretly sent by the Octad to infiltrate the Cult of the Dragon, where he had gained the rank of Wearer of Purple for the ruined keep of Battlegate. Under his leadership, the Cult of the Dragon was used to guard the Auantiver Labyrinth.\nIn , he received approval from the brotherhood to send adventurers after the red dragon Nevalarich. This required careful deliberation, once he discovered that it was acting as an agent of Aurgloroasa.\nHarlyns holdings were known to be guarded by golems.\nHarlyn was said to have worse pets and allies than golems."
