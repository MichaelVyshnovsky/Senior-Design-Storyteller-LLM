Kyra was an adventurer who had just arrived in Mulmaster.
Kyra was a laconic individual with great combat and survival skills. She did not agree at all with Florios style of command.
Kyra was a human ranger who, with her friends the Turami warrior Florio, dwarven cleric Rorik Ironheart, and elven druid Nualion Galanodel, decided to form an adventuring party in Selgaunt.
In 1491 DR, they went to Mulmaster with the intention of exploring some dwarven ruins in the Earthspur Mountains, but the city watch sergeant, Audra Maskyr, hired them to explore the citys sewers instead. During the exploration, they fought some large rats and lost Rorik Ironheart in a flood. At that point, Kyra and the others met another adventuring party sent by Sergeant Maskyr, and, with their help, Kyra and her companions exited from the sewers.
