Klalaera or Klalaerla was a Sharran high priestess at the House of Holy Night during the midâ€“8 century DR.
She was cruel and clearly anticipated opportunities to lash people. She also liked getting out of the temple when possible.
She wore a horned black mask.
Klalaera was a priestess with the specific title of "Overmistress of the Acolytes". She didnt get out much.
She carried a lash for ritual purposes.
She was quite excited to be treated familiarly by Darklady Avroana.
She had some manner of killing spell that had no visible manifestation, but caused intense agony and paralysis followed by body control. She also wielded a spell of flight.
Darklady Avroana sent Klalaerla after Dreadspell Elryn after sending him out to capture or kill a Chosen of Mystra two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the , with orders to slay Elryn and his Dreadspells if they faltered in their task.
She caught up to them as they were fleeing Azuth, who had manifested and scared them off from their task at Karsus Keep. Klalaera herded them back towards the ruin, apparently slaying Dreadspell Femter Deldrannus to convince them. They were interrupted by Starsunder and Umbregard appearing and attacking them during the chaos of battle, Dreadspell Daluth slew Klalaera. However, her body animated and spoke with Darklady Avroanas voice, attacking Elryn. Moments later, Klalaeras body was destroyed by the intervention of Tenthar Taerhamoos.
