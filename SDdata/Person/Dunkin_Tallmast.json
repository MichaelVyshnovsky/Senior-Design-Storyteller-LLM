        "History": "When the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'' of Captain [[Deudermont]] arrived in Mintarn in search of information about the mythical isle of [[Caerwich]], Dunkin's master Tarnheel was intrigued because he knew that on board was [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. Drizzt was considered by many to be the best swordsman in the Realms and Tarnheel also wanted this title. He thought this was the perfect occasion to decide the matter. Tarnheel sent Dunkin to Captain [[Deudermont]] and he convinced Drizzt to accept the fight."
