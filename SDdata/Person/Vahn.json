        "mainbody": "'''Vahn''' was a [[human]] [[arcane archer]] and one of a trio of [[adventurer]]s who arrived in [[Baldur's Gate]] as the [[Dark Alliance]] was rising to threaten the city.",
        "Abilities": "As an arcane archer, Vahn combined the arts of archery and [[arcane magic]]. His abilities included attacking with numerous kinds of magical [[arrow]]s and other things that aided his profession, such as a ''repulsion'' spell to keep enemies at range and having the means to reduce the weight of arrows he carried. Overall, Vahn constituted a balance between [[Adrianna]]'s focus on spells and [[Kromlech]]'s focus on arms and armor.",
        "History": {
            "War against the thieves": "After being attacked by the thief [[Karne]], Vahn paired up with Kromlech, a [[shield dwarf]] [[fighter]], and Adrianna a [[moon elf]] [[sorceress]] to get his [[gold]] back. After foiling various attempts by the guild to weaken Baldur's Gate, Kromlech and his friends were recruited into the [[Harpers]]. Finding the guild's base, the heroes fought Karne and appeared to kill him. The trio then fought against the guild leader, the [[beholder]], [[Xantam]], who'd come to Baldur's Gate through a shadow gate that led to the [[Sunset Mountains]].",
            "The fight against the Betrayer": "At the behest of the [[Harper agent]], [[Jherek]], the trio traveled to the Sunset Mountains. In the mountains, the heroes settled the three primary problems affecting Kromlech's home town of [[Easting]]: mountain creatures ([[ogres]] and [[gnolls]]), [[drow]] from [[Menzoberranzan]], and the [[white dragon|ice dragon]] [[Ciraxis]]. After killing the [[dragon]], the adventurers found another portal leading to the [[Marsh of Chelimber]]. In the marsh, Vahn met [[Sleyvas]], a [[lizardfolk]] [[shaman]], who was not worshiping a strange building called the [[Onyx Tower]]. After defeating the lizardfolk and their leader, Sleyvas sent the band of adventurers into the Onyx Tower, where they freed the [[ghost]] of the [[Elfsong Tavern]] by killing [[Eldrith|Eldrith the Betrayer]].",
            "Mordoc's Gate": "Later, Vahn and his companions were imprisoned in the [[Keep of Pale Night]] and interrogated by [[Mordoc SeLanmere]]'s servant [[Xanhast]]. After being rescued by Dorn Redbear, [[Vhaidra Uoswiir]], [[Ysuran Auondril]], [[Borador Goldhand]], [[Allessia Faithhammer]], the Harper Jherek and the [[Zhentarim]] Karne, Kromlech, Vahn, and Adrianna joined the battle against Mordoc in the Keep of Pale Night and against Mordoc's servants in Baldur's Gate. Vahn helped kill his former captor in the Onyx Tower, which crumbled for a final time."
