        "mainbody": "'''Maskar Wands''' ({{Pronounce|MASS|car|_|WANN|ds|refs=}}) was the patriarch of the [[Wands]] family in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|Marcus was always too fond of trinkets... The loss of the statue is a serious blow to Maskar, and I would not wish my \"esteemed colleague\" any prolonged discomfort...|[[Khelben Arunsun]] on Maskar Wands' stolen heirloom.}}",
        "Personality": "Maskar was a conservative and traditionally minded individual. He greatly disapproved of the abuse of magic and its wasteful, unrestrained use, even sometimes chastising [[Khelben Arunsun]].",
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], Maskar was faced with theft of the family heirloom, the ''[[golden scarab beetle]]'' of [[Mulhorand]]i origin that was with the Wands family for generations. To Maskar's embarrassment and annoyance, the thief was [[Marcus Wands]], a spoiled and opportunistic family member. To make the embarrassment even deeper, Marcus thought himself an adventurer and took the enchanted luck-giving statuette with him to [[Undermountain]], losing it to a monster. Maskar was forced to ask for help from his \"esteemed colleague\" Khelben. The Blackstaff tasked his trusted agent with the recovery, eventually returning the artifact to its rightful owner..\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], he was among the many powerful mages Arunsun brought together in order to cleanse part of the [[High Moor]] and restore [[Faer'tel'miir]], a lost city of [[Miyeritar]].<ref>\n\nIn the [[year of the Gauntlet]], He was also one of the staunch defenders of [[Waterdeep]] when [[Iakhovas]] led a [[Sahuagin]] attack on the city, when he lifted one [[giant sea snake|gigantic sea serpent]] from the harbor, crushed it and incinerated it with a tremendous [[fireball]]. He threatened the attackers with swift death for their mistake in attacking the city. His arrival and that of other great champions of the city rose the morale of the the citizens, who desperately tried to drive the attack back.\n\n{{Fq|text = You've made a mistake in attacking the City of Splendors this night. Retreat while you can. There will be no mercy|source = Maskar Wands}}",
        "Activities": "Maskar was rarely seen. Occasionally, he took student wizards but asked for payment involving difficult, [[Art]]-related quests."
