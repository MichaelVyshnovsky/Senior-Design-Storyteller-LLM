Melkatka was a drow commoner who served House Xorlarrin as slavemaster and torturer.
He was part of the first expedition to establish QXorlarrin. When, in 1484 DR, the drow captured the Companions of the Hall and put them into slavery, it was Melkatka who supervised them. However, he was soon killed by the vampire dwarf Thibbledorf Pwent who wanted free his friends.
