}}'''Melkatka''' was a [[drow]] commoner who served [[House Xorlarrin]] as slavemaster and torturer.

He was part of the first expedition to establish [[Q'Xorlarrin]]. When, in [[1484 DR]], the drow captured the [[Companions of the Hall]] and put them into slavery, it was Melkatka who supervised them. However, he was soon killed by the [[vampire]] [[dwarf]] [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] who wanted free his friends.
