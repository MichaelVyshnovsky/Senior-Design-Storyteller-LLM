They say it's good luck to placate the Bitch Queen after a drowning.''|Captain Foharell}}",
        "Description": "Foharell was a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] man with a charcoal gray skin tone, extremely uncommon among [[gold dwarves]] like he. The captain had cold gray eyes, bushy white beard and kept his head clean-shaven. Foharell wore a simple [[leather armor]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Captain Foharell frequented the Water Queen's House, uttering prayers to her goddess. He was at the temple shortly after one of its [[priestess]]es, [[Holli Dylford]], drowned whilst swimming in the [[Gray Harbor]]. Foharell thought it to be a good luck to appease the goddess after a drowning."
