'''Cyrume''' was a potter in [[Yhaunn]] who was secretly a member of the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|temple of Shar]].

==History==
In early [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], he was sent on a mission by [[Variance Amatick]] to poison [[Stonecutter's Well]] in the [[Stiltways]], the goal being to cause the [[Selûne|Selûnites]] of [[Moonshadow Hall]] to become fearful of a [[Sharran]] cell in the city, as well as spread general chaos and death.

Before he could complete his task, he was caught by the [[priestess]] [[Feena Archwood]], who ambushed him in her [[werewolf]] hybrid form. Knowing that escape was impossible, he chose to drink the flask of poison, dying in seconds while glorifying [[Shar]].

While Feena took the empty flask as proof of a Sharran presence in the city, Variance stripped Cyrume's corpse of its [[holy symbol]] of Shar and summoned a [[shadow mastiff]] to savagely maul it.
