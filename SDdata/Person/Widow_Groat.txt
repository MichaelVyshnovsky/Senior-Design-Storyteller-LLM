'''Widow Groat''' was a [[night hag]] who inhabited the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]], and was one of the caretakers of the ''[[Soulmonger]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had old [[gold]] coins covering her eyes, behind which a colony of [[ant]]s lay. The ants were her spies but also gave away her presence when she was nearing.

==Possessions==
Widow Groat had in her possession a [[heartstone]], a [[soul bag]], and a ring with eight keys.

==Relationships==
Widow Groat decided, along with the [[Sewn Sisters]], to care for the ''Soulmonger'' in return for an unlimited supply of souls to harvest. The hag coven included [[Peggy Deadbells]] and [[Baggy Nanna]], who were both as horrific in appearance as Widow Groat.

==History==
She and the Sewn Sisters had a long reputation of fear in the [[lower planes]] before joining [[Acererak]], and tending the [[atropal]] in the Tomb of the Nine Gods.
