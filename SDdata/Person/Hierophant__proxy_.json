        "Personality": "The Hierophant's primary passion in life was nature and her deity Silvanus, to a degree that one could call fanatical. There was a gleam in her eyes whenever she spoke of them, which was most of the time.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to having druidic powers, Silvanus granted the Hierophant the ability to transform herself into any animal or tree that she's seen within his [[divine realm]] of [[Summeroak]].",
        "Activities": "The Hierophant spent most of her time wandering the woodlands of the divine realm known as [[Tir na Og]], looking for those who might appreciate the wild beauty of Summeroak."
