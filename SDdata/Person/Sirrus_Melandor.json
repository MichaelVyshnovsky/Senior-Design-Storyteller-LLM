        "mainbody": "'''Sirrus Melandor''' was the Chief Prelate of [[Tyr]] in [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref group=\"note\">The \"current year\" for the people and events in [[Gateway to Ravens Bluff, the Living City]] is just before the [[Time of Troubles]], approximately [[1356 DR|1356]] -- [[1357 DR|1357]] DR.",
        "Description": "Sirrus Melandor stood {{SI|5'11\"|ft-in}} tall and weighed {{SI|155|lbs|k}}. He had salt-and-pepper hair, icy blue eyes, and was extremely good looking and charismatic.  He was usually seen dressed in temple vestments decorated with the symbols of his office.",
        "Personality": "Sirrus epitomized the god of justice, being slow to anger and weighing the considerations of each situation carefully, keeping his own council until he came to a decision.  When he spoke, it was with firm conviction. He was fairly successful at maintaining an air of cooperation among the civic temples for the betterment of the city.  He enjoyed studying other religions and his main goal in life was to expand the influence of his own temple, though without exploiting his office to do so.",
        "Possessions": "Sirrus possessed an ''[[amulet of life protection]]'', a ''[[decanter of endless water]]'', a ''[[robe of protection]] +5'', as well as a ''[[staff of striking]]'' that he typically fought with. He also owned an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] ''+3 [[hammer]]'' and a ''+3 [[mace]]'', but he seldom ever used either of them.",
        "History": "Sirrus was born in a hamlet near [[Ravens Bluff]]. His family were merchants.  He became an apprentice to the Temple of Tyr at age fourteen and became a full cleric at eighteen.  He spent three years in service to the temple and chief clerics and then left to travel the world and seek adventure.\n\nFourteen years later, Sirrus returned to his home temple and the high priest appointed him  as representative to the [[Clerical Circle]].  After the Chief Prelate died the Circle was in disagreement as to who should replace him and Sirrus was seemed to strike a balance that all considered an acceptable candidate.  This recognition boosted his reputation and he was later selected to be the city's new High Priest of Tyr."
