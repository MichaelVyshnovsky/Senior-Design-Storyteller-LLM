        "mainbody": "'''Neumas Moltengale''' was a traveling [[wizard]], active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Trying to overcompensate for his \"lost years,\" Neumas was recklessly driven to acquire knowledge and experience. Oftentimes, his rash decisions brought him a hefty reward.",
        "History": "Neumas was born and lived the majority of his life in a boring little village on one of the least notable islands of the [[Korinn Archipelago]]. His life in a hovel came to an end when Neumas Moltengale realized he possessed a talent with ''[[the Art]].'' By the age of 31, Neumas became a powerful and well-traveled wizard as capable, if not more so, than his fellow individuals with a [[sorcerous]] gift.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Neumas Moltengale was among the ambitious adventurers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
