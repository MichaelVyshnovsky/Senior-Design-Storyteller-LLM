        "mainbody": "Neumas Moltengale was a traveling wizard, active in the 14 century DR.\nTrying to overcompensate for his \"lost years,\" Neumas was recklessly driven to acquire knowledge and experience. Oftentimes, his rash decisions brought him a hefty reward.\nNeumas was born and lived the majority of his life in a boring little village on one of the least notable islands of the Korinn Archipelago. His life in a hovel came to an end when Neumas Moltengale realized he possessed a talent with the Art. By the age of 31, Neumas became a powerful and well-traveled wizard as capable, if not more so, than his fellow individuals with a sorcerous gift.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Neumas Moltengale was among the ambitious adventurers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
