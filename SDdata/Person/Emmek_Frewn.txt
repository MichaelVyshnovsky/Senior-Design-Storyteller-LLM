'''Emmek Frewn''' was a barkeep in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Emmek always disliked the tanning business. Instead of pursuing the family trade, he used all his money in the development of a new tavern. He was stingy in paying some types of expenses and skimped on amenities, but too free with his money on flashy things.

==Relationship==
Emmek hated dealing with the [[League of Skinners and Tanners]]. In the past, he had had dealings with the [[Shard Shunners]], a gang of [[halfling]] [[wererat]]s.

==History==
Frewn's family originated in [[Neverwinter]] but relocated to Waterdeep after the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]]. Frewn's father worked in a tanning business in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of the city. After the death of his parents, Emmek's sister took care of the family business.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} Emmek wanted to open a tavern and tried to buy the [[Trollskull Manor]], but was outbid by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Instead, he opened a pub nearby in [[Trollskull Alley]] but got into trouble with the [[Carpenters', Roofers' and Plasterers' Guild]] for not asking their assistance and offended a member of the [[Cellarers and Plumbers Guild|Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild]]. Emmek made it his goal to be the most successful tavern owner in the North Ward and had no scruples when it came to ruining his competitors' businesses.
