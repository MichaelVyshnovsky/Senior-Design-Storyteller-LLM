'''Grumink the Renegade''' was a [[dwarf]] at the [[Shrine of the Tender Oath]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Personality==
Grumink was a bloodthirsty and callous individual. He stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. Grumink delighted in building a reputation as a cold-blooded killer, and went out of his way to slay people when doing so might add to his notoriety or attract the attention of the law. He might claim that it wasn't personal, but it was. He also did not care about desecrating a shrine to [[Sharindlar]], a dwarven goddess of fertility and love.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Grumink and his mercenary band were hired by the [[Oni mage|oni]] [[Obratu]] in order to seize control of the [[Shrine of the Tender Oath]], which the oni believed to be an entrance to King [[Torhild Flametongue]]'s tomb.

At last, some adventurers went to investigate the shrine and defeated Grumink and Obratu.
