Lortimer was an old drunkard that lived in Baldurs Gate.
Lortimer wore a blue long-sleeved shirt and a dark-gray mantle. He had a thin gray mustache and dark-gray hair.
The old man was often found to be asleep at his table in the bottom right corner of the Elfsong Tavern.
Circa 1374 DR, Lortimer was a regular patron of the Elfsong Tavern.
