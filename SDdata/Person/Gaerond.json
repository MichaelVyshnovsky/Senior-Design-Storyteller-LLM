        "mainbody": "Gaerond of the Scars was an adventurer leading the Bloodshields Band in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had sword scars, making him fearsome.\nWhile professional, he was not above greed.\nHe was very quick.\nHe carried a longsword with peace-strings, and at least two longsarks.\nHe was a veteran adventurer.\nThe Bloodshields Band numbered six, including him, Rornagar Breakblade, Flamdar, Malkym and Lylar.\nGaerond led the Bloodshields Band into Shadowdale in , on commission from a rich Sembian who had paid a large amount upfront, looking for Elminster Aumar, the ancient archmage. Gaerond came first upon the Old Skull Inn, where he was able to commission the youngster Thal, actually a doppelganger, to lead him to Elminster. Thal took them to a cave, where Gaerond met a doppelganger pretending to be Elminster when they revealed they actually intended to decapitate Elminster and carry his head as a trophy to Sembia, a number of hidden doppelgangers fired a volley of crossbows into the band, slaying them almost on the spot. Gaerond was the last to die, though not by a great difference."
