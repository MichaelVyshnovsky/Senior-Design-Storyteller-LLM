        "mainbody": "horongh Davarragar was a sword-swinging adventurer in the city of Delzimmer in southeast Faer√ªn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nDavarragar was a tall, muscular man with deeply tanned skin.\nThorongh Davarragar was something of a braggart, claiming to have slain dragons in his barbaric Savage Frontier homeland, but Shonsarra Tel, a mage from Oslin, opined that he had probably never seen snow in his life, and ridiculed his dragonslayer appellation.\nDavarragar was one of three men in Delzimmer known in the local culture as the \"Night Scourges\" the other two were the smooth-talking Imriskril Melsamber and the jolly and attentive Marlyar Nilthrul. What started out as gossip about their romantic conquests grew into wild tales of amorous adventure, complete with balcony-leaping, ledge-hanging, and rooftop-fleeing, featuring fair maidens, furious fathers, and jealous mates. Some women in town even attested to the veracity of certain stories to enhance their social standing with notoriety or sully the reputation of a rival. All three Scourges were the subject of serious scrutiny by menfolk in town with a vested interest in the honor of their wives, daughters, and consorts. The storied trio could not attend a feast or frequent a tavern without at least a few menfolk watching them with looks of warning and fidgeting with their weapons."
