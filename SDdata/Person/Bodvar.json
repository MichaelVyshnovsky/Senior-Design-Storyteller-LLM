        "mainbody": "'''Bodvar''', better known as '''Bodvar the Black''', was a chieftain of the [[Moor Eagle]] clan of [[Vaasa]] in the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the first ruler of the [[Granite Tower]].{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|81}}",
        "Description": "Bodvar was a handsome man with deep-set [[sapphire]]-blue eyes with a wild mane of [[bloodstone]]-red hair and a matching beard. He was a capable fighter and a respected leader of his clan.",
        "Personality": "Bodvar was considered wise and wary among his people, and did not hesitate to risk his own safety for their sake. He was incredibly calm under pressure, highly perceptive, and a charismatic deal-maker. He was also entrepreneurial, with a knack for recognizing and capitalizing on important opportunities, but also cautious when he suspected trouble.",
        "Possessions": "Bodvar favored the [[sword]], and carried a [[steel]] [[longsword]] and [[dagger]] prior to his acquisition of a ''[[darksword]]'' which could slice through the monsters of Vaasa with ease.\n\nBodvar had a suit of armor made of [[dragonhide]], although he lost the matching trousers. The armor had the special quality of dampening any noises or vibrations that he made.",
        "Relationships": "Bodvar was well-respected by his clan and by his wife, [[Idona]], whom he loved sincerely. His relationship with [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] was complicated, but based on a modicum of mutual respect. Bodvar was deeply thankful for the help Melegaunt had provided to his clan, but just as deeply suspicious of his true motives.",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "At some point Bodvar had a child, and passed his ''darksword'' to them. The pact with Melegaunt would not be invoked until long after Bodvar's death, during the lifetime of his great-granddaughter [[Vala Thorsdotter]].{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|83}} His heirs would continue to rule the Granite Tower and wield the ''darkswords'' through the 15{{th}} century DR, at which time they proudly called themselves \"[[Scions of the Granite Tower|blood scions of Bodvar the Black]]\".{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}"
