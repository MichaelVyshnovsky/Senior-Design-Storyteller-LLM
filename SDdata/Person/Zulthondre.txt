'''Zulthondre''' was a [[beholder]] of [[Zhentil Keep]] until the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
It did not take kindly to being outwitted by humans.

==Abilities==
It had a sharp ability to discern smells.

==Description==
Its body had chitinous plates.

==Relationships==
It allowed itself to be summoned to [[Manshoon]]'s aid, and had conferenced with the mage before.

==History==
Zultondre was one of two [[beholder]]s that met with Manshoon and [[Sarhthor]], offering the [[lich lord]] [[Iliph Thraun]] and the methods to control him in order to better control ''[[spellfire]]''.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|43-48|2}}

Later that year, Zulthondre was summoned by Manshoon to the [[Stonelands]] during a fight with Elminster and [[Storm Silverhand]] and joined the battle. However, he realized that he recognized [[Elminster Aumar]]'s smell from the earlier meeting; before he could give any indication of it to Manshoon, he was struck down with a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' by Elminster.
