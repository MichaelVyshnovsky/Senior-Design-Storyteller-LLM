Zulthondre was a beholder of Zhentil Keep until the midâ€“14 century DR.
It did not take kindly to being outwitted by humans.
It had a sharp ability to discern smells.
Its body had chitinous plates.
It allowed itself to be summoned to Manshoons aid, and had conferenced with the mage before.
Zultondre was one of two beholders that met with Manshoon and Sarhthor, offering the lich lord Iliph Thraun and the methods to control him in order to better control spellfire.
Later that year, Zulthondre was summoned by Manshoon to the Stonelands during a fight with Elminster and Storm Silverhand and joined the battle. However, he realized that he recognized Elminster Aumars smell from the earlier meeting before he could give any indication of it to Manshoon, he was struck down with a meteor swarm by Elminster.
