'''Mandrake Deepwise''' was a [[human]] explorer of the [[Underdark]] in [[1484 DR]].

==History==
Mandrake was a legendary member of the [[Guild of Underdark Guides]], having performed some difficult explorations. 

However, he disappeared during one expedition, so his friend [[Davlin Hoth]] sent an adventurer to find him. In truth, he was captured by a [[drow]] raiding party under the command of [[Relonagh Xorlarrin]] and later given to [[Thlorrog]]'s sect of [[mind flayer]]s, who performed experiments upon him. When the adventurer freed Mandrake from some drow, he asked to be left alone, because the illithids had implanted something inside his head (that is, [[ceremorphosis]]). Davlin later told the story that Mandrake had died.

==Relationships==
Mandrake was a leading figure in the Guild of Underdark Guides and was a good friend of the fellow Guild explorer Davlin Hoth.
