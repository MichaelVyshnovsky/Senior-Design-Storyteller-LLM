        "mainbody": "'''Feldaern Jathlet''' was a member of the [[Jathlet]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. Feldaern was one of the \"forest of uncles\" in the Jathlet clan&mdash;either a brother to [[Jolthur Jathlet|Jolthur]], the patriarch of the family until his unfortunate demise, one of Jolthur's uncles, or one of his first cousins.<ref group=\"note\">There were at least two dozen male relatives that were uncles or great uncles to the youngest generation of Jathlets. He was a taciturn man that pursued his own interests around the region, occasionally touching base in Delzimmer for a few days before traveling to some other business opportunity (legitimate or otherwise). When in town, he (and all the other uncles) exerted what influence he could on [[Elsraea Jathlet]], hoping to guide the family business in the most favorable direction as he saw it."
