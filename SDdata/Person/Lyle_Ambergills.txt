Lyle Ambergills was the first mate aboard the Osprey during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He had brown eyes and brown hair, though he was almost bald. He grew a long handlebar mustache. He stood  tall. Lyle was incredibly strong despite his average height.
Lyle was a competent ship master and, despite wanting to captain a crew of his own, remained loyal to his captain Raider McAllister. He usually handled the recruitment of new sailors aboard the Osprey.
Lyle wore a pair of bracers of defense and wielded an enchanted bastard sword. He never wore armor.
