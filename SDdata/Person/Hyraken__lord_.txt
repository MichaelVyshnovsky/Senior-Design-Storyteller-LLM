Lord Hyraken of Hilp was one of the leaders of the Freedom Warriors in the political aftermath of the Goblin War.
According to Lady Kestrel Vaylan, he was a cruel man who worked his servants to death and consorted with priestesses of Loviatar. Rumors said that his hatred of Regent Alusair Obarskyr was due to her rejection of a proposal of marriage in the 1360s DR.
