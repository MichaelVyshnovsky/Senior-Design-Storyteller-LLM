'''Lord Hyraken''' of [[Hilp]] was one of the leaders of the [[Freedom Warriors]] in the political aftermath of the [[Goblin War]].

According to Lady [[Kestrel Vaylan]], he was a cruel man who worked his servants to death and consorted with priestesses of [[Loviatar]]. Rumors said that his hatred of Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]] was due to her rejection of a proposal of marriage in the 1360s [[DR]].
