'''Tiglath''' was the high priestess of [[Tiamat]] in [[Unther]] by [[1357 DR]], and again from [[1374 DR]] onward.

==History==
Once, Tiglath was a member of [[Gilgeam]]'s harem.<ref>{{Cite web/Books/The Alabaster Staff: A History of Unther}}

In [[1358 DR]], during the [[Godswar]], she helped Tiamat gain another avatar and witnessed the battle between Gilgeam and her goddess. However, afterward, Tiglath disappeared.

At one point, however, she resurfaced in [[Messemprar]]. After [[Mulhorand]]'s invasion, Tiglath regained her position as high priestess.
 
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}} Tilgath helped the [[Harper]] agent [[Demok]] and the young thief [[Kehrsyn]] to ruin the plot of [[Zimrilim]] to use the ''[[Alabaster Staff]]'' to raise the preserved body of Gilgeam in order to try to use the undead god as a puppet to rule Unther. She led the Tiamatan troops in fighting the undead mad god. 

In 1374 DR she was the most powerful religious leader in free Unther.

==Activities==
Often, she went into [[Eastern Shaar]] to coordinate with the bandit leader [[Furifax]].  

==Personality==
Tiglath's goal was to destroy Gilgeam and his church and Tiamat was only a means to an end. She was filled with hatred and vengeance but was not an evil woman, a fact that concerned her goddess. After the Godswar, her new objective was to create a united church of Tiamat.

==Relationship==
Tiglath was good friends with [[Furifax]] for many years.
