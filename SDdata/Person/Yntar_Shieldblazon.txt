Yntar Shieldblazon was a bard.
Around 1370 DR, Yntar was a local member of the Heralds of Faer√ªn, holding the title of Flailchains. He was an authority on the history of Westgate. Once the role of Flailchains had been a public one, but after the death of the last king, Verovan, it became an independent agent but with strong ties to the rulers of the city.
