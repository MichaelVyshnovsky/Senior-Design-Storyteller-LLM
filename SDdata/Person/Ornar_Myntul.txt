Ornar Myntul was a master carpenter, furniture-maker and shop owner, from the city of Sundabar. During the 14 century DR, Ornar was known as the greatest of the citys master woodworkers, having trained some of the citys best. By those years Ornar had reached quite an advance age he was believed to be over 112 years old in 1365 DR.
In addition to his other skills and talents, Ornar was an expert at identifying different types of woods, even if they were partially destroyed or charred.
In his twilight years, Ornar spent his time whittling walking sticks featuring monstrous faces upon their handles and running his furniture shop, Old Ornars Beds and Tables.
