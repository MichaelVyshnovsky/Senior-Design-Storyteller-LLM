A servant minded the house while he was away, and was well-paid and happy.\n\nHe traded furs and ice in exchange for timber and [[steel]], and sometimes new [[spell]]s. Loving life on the caravans, he had journeyed all over Tabot and much of [[T'u Lung]]. Nako was an able guide and a true adventurer, telling many stories of the legends of Tabot and his own deeds. He respected Tabot's High Lord of Oceans and the theocratic government."
