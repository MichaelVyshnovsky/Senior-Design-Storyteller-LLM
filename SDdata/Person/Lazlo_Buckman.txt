'''Lazlo Buckman''' was a male [[human]] and mayor of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

{{quote|''This village has been through a lot, and were preparing to fight them off as best we can. Good thing their wings are all gnarled - they can't fly over the walls that way.''|Lazlo Buckman}}

==Description==
Lazlo Buckman was a tall, strong, red-faced man with a serious demeanor and chiseled features.

==History==
Lazlo was a member of the West Harbor militia, who fought against the [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. Despite the military career, he also brewed the famous [[Harvest Mead]]

Lazlo survived the [[Second War of the Shadow]] and returned back to West Harbor. After [[Georg Redfell]] died, Laszlo became the new mayor of [[West Harbor]]. While he repaired the damage with the other surviving villagers, [[undead]] attacked them. To keep the village safe, he bribed two [[black dragon]]s, [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]], with Harbor Mead to stop the attacks. Once he ran out of the mead that the dragons came to love, Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor were infuriated, capturing [[Tarmas]], the village's [[wizard]]. Lazlo tasked a group of adventurers who worked with merchant [[Sa'Sani]], with freeing Tarmas, and then to attack the dragons, in exchange for establishing trade relationship with West Harbor. Lazlo claimed that the dragons simply sought to destroy the town, withholding the information about the previous arrangement with them.
