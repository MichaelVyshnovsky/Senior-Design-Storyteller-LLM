Halgren Deaths Head was the husband of Alia Shield-Maiden and the leader of the adventuring company – Annals of Halgren circa the 13 century DR.
Halgren was a strong dwarven fighter and master of axe and crossbow. He was a mountain of a man who stood in the front lines in battle, sometimes by himself.
Halgrens wife always stood to the dwarfs right hand – his shield arm, gaining her the name of "Shield-Maiden". To the left side stood Bastinado, the ranger and expert in battle.
The Annals of Halgren was established circa the Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR, by Halgren Deaths Head and his wife, Alia Shield-Maiden. The shield dwarves started their adventuring career in the Sunset Mountains, Bruenghor Clans home. Halgrens family was haunted by alledged tainted blood. One of his ancestors was a duergar criminal named Kaervas, and in attempts to wipe foul reputation from his family name, Halgren Deaths Head set out to earn gold and respect. For nearly a decade, Halgren and Alia traveled together until the Year of Storms, 1310 DR, when they gathered a band of mercenaries in Luskan, eager to earn gold and fame across the North Faerûn.
In the , Annals of Halgren found itself in the northern city of Luskan. By that time, the troupe gained new members, Bastinado, Silence-Before-Iron, Mordakai of Thay, and Kei the Wooden Idol.
