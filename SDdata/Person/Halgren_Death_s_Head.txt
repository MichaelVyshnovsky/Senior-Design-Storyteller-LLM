'''Halgren Death's Head''' was the husband of [[Alia Shield-Maiden]] and the leader of the adventuring company – [[Annals of Halgren]] ''circa'' the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Halgren was a strong dwarven fighter and master of [[axe]] and [[crossbow]]. He was a mountain of a man who stood in the front lines in battle, sometimes by himself.

==Relationships==
Halgren's wife always stood to the dwarf's right hand – his shield arm, gaining her the name of "Shield-Maiden". To the left side stood [[Bastinado]], the [[ranger]] and expert in battle.

==History==
The Annals of Halgren was established ''circa'' the [[1300 DR|Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR]], by Halgren Death's Head and his wife, Alia Shield-Maiden. The [[shield dwarves]] started their adventuring career in the [[Sunset Mountains]], [[Bruenghor Clan]]'s home. Halgren's family was haunted by alledged tainted blood. One of his ancestors was a [[duergar]] criminal named [[Kaervas]], and in attempts to wipe foul reputation from his family name, Halgren Death's Head set out to earn gold and respect. For nearly a decade, Halgren and Alia traveled together until the [[1310 DR|Year of Storms, 1310 DR]], when they gathered a band of mercenaries in [[Luskan]], eager to earn gold and fame across the [[North Faerûn]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Annals of Halgren found itself in the northern city of [[Luskan]]. By that time, the troupe gained new members, [[Bastinado]], [[Silence-Before-Iron]], [[Mordakai of Thay]], and [[Kei the Wooden Idol]].
