'''Alro "Five Flames" Randulkyn''' was a [[wizard]] and a member of the slavery and crime syndicate known as the [[Tarntar]]. His specialty was [[evocation]] spells.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|34}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 29: The Battle at the Bar}}

==Personality==
Alro was a rollicking, swashbuckler of a mage that didn't much care about collateral damage when it came to spellcasting. He wrapped himself in fine clothing and partook of the best wine and women that money could buy. While enjoying life was high on his list of priorities, his fun sometimes turned into cruelty to others.

==History==
Sometime around the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Alro was present in the common room of the [[Whistling Wizard]] inn when [[Elminster Aumar]] of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] walked in and started teasing prominent members of the Tarntar about personal and private matters of business and pleasure. Alro was not foolish enough to attack the Sage of Shadowdale, but when the Old Mage sat on the lap of one of his business partners and transformed into a woman, he was likely one of the first to attack with spellcasting abandon. Unfortunately for him, the woman was the [[Simbul]]. She deflected, countered, or neutralized all spells thrown at her and concentrated on defending the inn as six of her apprentices surged into the room accompanied by her sister [[Storm Silverhand]]. Thus began the conflict known as the [[Battle at the Bar]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|35}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 30: Endgame at the Wizard}}

Alro met his doom during the battle as he was either backed up to the bar or had ducked behind it when the various spells flying around the room interacted with the spells placed on the wood (''[[magic mouth]]'' and ''[[firequench]]'' to name two) and caused a huge explosion that destroyed the ceiling above, spilling the contents and occupants down into the common room.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|35-36}}
