'''Pahelhe Firecaster''' was an [[adventurer]] and member of the [[She-Wolves]] [[mercenaries]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Pahelhe and [[Brianna Tarvison]] attended a party at [[Thistleflame Keep]], held by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] for King [[Azoun IV]]'s birthday. They stayed the night in the Keep as guests and were interviewed as suspects after Lord Thistle appeared to be murdered that night, but proved to be completely uninvolved.
