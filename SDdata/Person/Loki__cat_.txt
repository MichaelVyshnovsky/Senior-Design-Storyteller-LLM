'''Loki''' was an old gluttonous [[cat|tomcat]] that belonged to [[Firtha Kerdos]] of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Loki was one of the many cats that lived with the elderly foul-tempered blind woman Firtha Kerdos in the dock district of the town of Targos. Shortly before the town became menaced by [[goblin]] raids orchestrated by the [[Legion of the Chimera]], ''circa'' [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Loki went missing. The tomcat had made his way into one of the warehouses of the [[Gallaway Trading Coster]] where he went hunting for mice. The cat consumed over a dozen rodents, twice his weight, and died of overeating. According to his mistress Firtha, he died happy.
