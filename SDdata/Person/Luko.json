        "Description": "Luko had dirty blond hair that was curly. He had skinny arms.\n\nLuko wore a dirty [[apron]] over his other clothes. Around his bicep, he wore a green and brown rag, as a symbol of his membership with the Taverners, Innkeepers, and Provisioners.",
        "Activities": "Luko delivered [[butter]] in [[pail]]s to various inns and distributed it with butter paddles.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Luko was on his way to make a delivery to the buttery of [[Bustamante's Excellent Hostelry]], when he claimed that the girl [[Scab]] somehow soured his butter with her witching power. He was part of a small mob of workers who had dragged out Scab from an alley, at which point [[Zaranda Star]] intervened."
