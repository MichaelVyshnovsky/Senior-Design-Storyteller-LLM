'''Rolf Trygveson''' was a notable inhabitant of [[Hawa]].

==Description==
Tall and strong, Rolf had striking blond hair that stood out among the predominantly dark-haired [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] of the [[Corsair Domains]]. He preferred wearing his hair in two long braids that matched his braided beard. His one eye was blue, and a jeweled patch covered the other. Rolf preferred loose, brightly colored clothing to armor, relying on his dexterity to protect him in combat.

==Personality==
Rolf was a ferocious [[pirate]].

==Possessions==
His ship ''[[Raven (ship)|Raven]]'' earned notoriety throughout the land of [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
Rolf and his crew grew lazy in the warm Zakharan realm, often lounging on the island called the [[Camel's Hump]] for long periods of time.

==History==
Rolf originally hailed from the barbarian tribes near [[Icewind Dale]]. Piqued by curiosity, Rolf moved south when his people began trading with people from the [[Sword Coast]]. Eventually his pirating ways wore out his welcome, and he and his crew moved even further south. Somewhere in the [[Great Sea]] they ran across a Zakharan raiding party and followed them back to the [[Land of Fate]].
