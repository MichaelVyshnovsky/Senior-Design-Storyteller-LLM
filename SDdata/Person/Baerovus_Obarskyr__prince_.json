[[Dungeon magazine 198|''Dungeon'' #198]] ([[Wizards of the Coast]]) (198), p. 9., more commonly known as '''Prince Baerovus,''' was a Crown Prince of [[Cormyr]] and son of [[Irvel Obarskyr|King Irvel]]. On [[Nightal 5]] of [[1486 DR]] he abdicated the throne in favor of his sister [[Raedra Obarskyr|Princess Raedra]] after the death of his father on [[Uktar 14]] and grandfather on [[Eleint 5]] of the same year.",
        "Description and Personality": "As a young man, Baerovus was described as being of slim build, with long hair that he hid his face behind, save for official appearances of the royal family. He was meek and did not desire the throne. He disliked magic and the battlefield. He liked animals, tending to wounded ones he found in royal hunts. He had a particular interest in [[Horse|light horses]], enjoying a large stable of them. The [[Calimite|calamite]] breed was his personal favorite.",
        "Abilities": "The prince was a bad swordsman, and wasn't considered useful wielding any blade other then a hunting knife. However, his skills with bow and arrow knew no equal among his royal kin.",
