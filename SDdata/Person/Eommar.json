        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Eommar could often be found in the Alliance Arms Inn, drunkenly leering at women. He joyously greeted strangers and asked them to buy him a drink because \"the end was coming.\" He was referring to a recent development. As of 1374 DR, the streets of Port Llast were frequented by walking [[undead]] every night, which Eommar saw as an ill omen. To an especially friendly drinking buddy, someone who would spend [[coin]] on the old drunk, Eommar was willing to reveal that he heard one of the wandering undead creatures speak. The undead chanted \"Last Port,\" Port Llast's name from ten generations past. Eommar believed that it was the [[curse]] of Last Port's last noble line, the [[Adreum]] Curse."
