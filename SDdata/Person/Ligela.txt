'''Ligela''' was a fickle and vain [[earth spirit]] who dwelt on the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and was a patron of a small [[saru]] village in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ligela took on a form of an earth woman or an earth child. She walked about the saru unseen, and where she stepped, death followed.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Once Broken|8}}

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Year of Discovery on the Malatran Calendar, Ligela became angered with a saru village after a saru child broke tabu by falling on a patch of sacred flowers. She could not tolerate such disrespect and started reclaiming nourishment she gifted them through land, jungle, and beast.

Spirits showed a vision of the wasting curse to [[Bengoukee]], the shaman of [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]], telling him that only a certain group of the heroes of the Living Jungle would be allowed to aid the saru.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Once Broken|4}}

When the adventurers reached the village, they were greeted with the sight and scent of death. The homes were turned to tombs, and surviving saru were wasting away, consumed by painful convulsions, including [[Brunga]], the child responsible for the spirit's rage. They learned that the saru were cursed a month prior. First, Ligela deprived the saru of food. Then she rotted any fruit gathered and stored in the village. Saru grew weaker and started perishing, unable to eat or drink. No healing magics was effective in removing the affliction.

The saru shaman [[Magilla]] used the last of his waning strength to build a special totem to appease the spirit's rage. And the heroes of the Living Jungle were tasked with aiding him. They were sent to retrieve special green river stones and [[giant bee]] [[wax]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Once Broken|12}}
