'''El Nar'ysr''', which means "'''The Phoenix'''" in [[Alzhedo]], was one of the most prolific prophets ever to live on [[Toril]], with greater [[Divination|divinatory]] power than even [[Alaundo]] the Seer, famous for many thousands of predictions later recorded in a multi-volume work entitled ''[[The Phoenix Prophecies]]''.

==Description==
The Nar'ysr, whose real name was lost to history, was one of the [[Abbalayar]], He had reddish skin and golden-colored hair.

==Personality==
The Phoenix was a quiet man who rarely spoke, but when he felt a prophecy coming upon him, he spoke with boldness.

==Relationships==
The Nar'ysr was known to have had descendants, though only a few of these inherited his prophetic powers or distinct physical traits.

==History==
The Nar'ysr lived in the time of [[Calimshan]]'s ancient past before even the end of the [[Calim Empire]].<ref group="note">This is known because it is explained in ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' that he foretold the Genie Wars. During his life, he gave thousands of cryptic prophecies.

His prophecies were recorded sometime in the tenth century [[DR]] by the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|Herald]] [[Heralds (local)|Swordswreath]]. She composed a seven-volume work from source fragments and a manuscript passed on by the Abbalayar prophet [[Kadh al Mjol|Kadh yn Ororm al Mjol]]. This opus was titled ''The Phoenix Prophecies''. Among these more than 8,000 prophecies, the Nar'ysr predicted the deaths of [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], and [[Myrkul]], the nine [[Ages of Calimshan]], the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]], the [[Time of Troubles]], and the attack of the [[Tuigan Horde]].
