O-Shino was a young maiden in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
O-Shino was an independent-minded young woman of modest means. She had no family and for money she did questionable things.
O-Shino was hired by the korobokuru yakuza Ichi to seduce the monks Anchin and Kaian under the orders of monks of a rival sect, Kogi and Bupposo. Afterward, however, O-Shino came to regret her actions and wanted bloodless revenge against Kogi and Bupposo.
O-Shino was always a modest and unassuming individual. For necessity, she would do dishonest things but always regretted it.
