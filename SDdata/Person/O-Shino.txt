'''O-Shino''' was a young maiden in [[Nakamaru]] around [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
O-Shino was an independent-minded young woman of modest means. She had no family and for money she did questionable things.

==History==
O-Shino was hired by the [[korobokuru]] [[yakuza]] [[Ichi (korobokuru)|Ichi]] to seduce the monks [[Anchin]] and [[Kaian]] under the orders of monks of a rival sect, [[Kogi]] and [[Bupposo]]. Afterward, however, O-Shino came to regret her actions and wanted bloodless revenge against Kogi and Bupposo.

==Personality==
O-Shino was always a modest and unassuming individual. For necessity, she would do dishonest things but always regretted it.
