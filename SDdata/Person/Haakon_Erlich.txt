Haakon Erlich was a corrupt officer of the Red Plumes in Hillsfar in the late 15 century DR.
He was approached by the sorcerer Breex Vandermast with an idea to become rich kidnap non-human farmers from around the city and sell them to the Hillsfar Arena. Haakon agreed and they captured many people, included the halfling Tinfellow family and the drow Arrizz. At last, Breex and corrupt Red Plumes tried to capture an adventuring party hired by the Harpers to find the kidnapped people. Haakon joined the fight but was defeated by the adventurers.
Haakon was a coward who hid his true nature with a show of violence. He was afraid of Breex and his men knew this.
