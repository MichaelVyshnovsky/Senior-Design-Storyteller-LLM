'''Zhiir''' was on of the [[illithid]]s who ran the Black Market, hidden in the mountains to the east from [[Samargol]] in the jungle nation of [[Samarach]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a mind flayer seer [[Oin'Chakalop]] psychically touched the mind of a mad god. This left Oin'Chakalop's aberrant mind shattered, incapable of speech. Zhiir took the ex-seer under his wing to work as a servant in the Black Market. Zhiir's business was dealing with select clients only. Some had to commit murder to get on the illithid's customer list. He collected and procured rare magical tomes for those wealthy enough to pay for the service. In [[1374 DR]], one such client requested a book of elemental magic lore compiled by a wizardly cabal in Samarach for a fee of 10,000 [[gold]] pieces. The book was written and pending delivery until the carriers went dark on Zhiir. The illithid was looking for a hireling capable of infiltrating the mage tower called the [[Tempest's Fury]] and recovering the missing arcane tome.

The book in question collected research notes on summoning and "enhancing" various elemental creatures from the planes. The magical procedures used to achieve that goal were utterly torturous and driven most summoned elementals mad with pain and suffering. One of such summoned beings was a [[djinni]] [[Shamal]] who suffered the empowering rituals but proved too powerful to remain restrained by a ''binding circle''. Driven mad by torture, Shamal decimated the cabal and took over the tower. The book of Zhiir's research remained locked away in the Tempest's Fury's hidden vault.
