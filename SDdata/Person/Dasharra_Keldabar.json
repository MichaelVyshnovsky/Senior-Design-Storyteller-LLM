        "mainbody": "'''Dasharra Keldabar''' was a [[Shield dwarf]] who lived in [[Fireshear]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].",
        "Activities": "She lived north of Fireshear on a ridge overlooking the sea, where she raised [[griffon]]s, trained them to be ridden, and taught others how to ride. To protect her precious mounts, she kept six [[Zhentarim]] mercenaries in her service. In addition to training those willing to ride griffons for a fee of 250 [[gp]], Dasharra allowed her mounts to be flown within a few hundred miles radius for a fee of 25 gp per person per day.",
        "History": "Prior to retiring to Fireshear, Dasharra was a [[Generic City Watch captain (Waterdeep)|civilar]] (captain) in [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Griffon Cavalry]]. \n\nBy the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], she had retired and joined the [[Emerald Enclave]]. During her retirement in Fireshear, her main dwelling was an underground hovel with a low, sturdy wooden shelter adjacent that held the griffons.\n\nDuring her retirement, a ship full of [[frost giant]]s launched an attack on the town of Fireshear and Dasharra helped in its defense by providing aerial support via heavy crossbow from atop her griffon [[Screecher]]. She was also helped to repel the giants by [[Minsc]], [[Boo]], [[Krydle]], [[Delina]], [[Shandie]], [[Nerys Kathon|Nerys]], and [[Saarvin]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2}}"
