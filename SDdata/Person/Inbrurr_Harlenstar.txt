}}'''Inbrurr Harlenstar''' was a [[gold dwarf]] from the [[Great Rift]] in [[south Faerûn]] during the tenure of [[Amberu Khôltar]] as Shieldlord (governor) of [[Khôltar]], the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|84}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 64: Khôltar, Part 15, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 2}}

==Personality==
Inbruur was a supercilious snob when it came to [[humans]]. He believed that the humans in the Iron City were profiting off of dwarven labor and goods.

==History==
Harlenstar petitioned the leadership of the [[Deep Realm]] and demanded that they seize full control of the Iron City, evict the humans from their homes and workshops, let deserving dwarves take over the businesses, and keep the profits in dwarven hands where they belonged. The court of the Deep Realm saw no reason to disrupt a thriving economy that was consuming Great Rift exports, and they were not dissatisfied with the way Amberu Khôltar was running things, so they rebuffed his demands as shortsighted and foolish.

This rankled Inbrurr like a burr in his boot and he decided to force the Deep Realm's hand by instigating an elaborate plot to kill the Shieldlord, blame the humans, inflame the ire of the dwarves, cast suspicions in the eyes of the humans about the replacement Shieldlord, and provoke them to rebel against the dwarves which would necessitate military action to quell the riots and oust the humans.

In the [[374 DR|Year of the Thoughtful Man, 374 DR]], Harlenstar put his plan into action, hiring assassins to kill Amberu Khôltar using poisoned weapons. He went through multiple layers of intermediaries so the ones doing the dirty deed would not have any idea who they were working for. This part of the plot succeeded and the founder of the Iron City was slain, but the [[rogue]]s were paranoid enough to be on guard against anyone trying to eliminate them in turn, and managed to ambush and capture two of the clean-up crew. The garthraun (local police) hired some [[wizard]]s that were passing through the city to investigate the murder and they slowly peeled back the layers until they found proof that Inbrurr was behind it all.

The dwarves of the Deep Realm immediately moved to exile Harlenstar, but he fled into the [[Underdark]] before he could be arrested and put on trial. Inbrurr was never again seen in Khôltar or the Great Rift, but his name was whispered even centuries later whenever folks spoke of dastardly schemes against the Iron City.
