Habib Khalid Achmed Allafif was an scimitar-wielding thief from the city of Athkatla in the midâ€“to-late 14 century DR.
Originally from Calimshan, Habib made a living through thievery in Athkatla. In the , Habib thought himself to be pursued by Athkatlas law enforcement. He may have run into Abdel Adrian one night and confused him with the city guard the thief proudly proclaimed his name and launched his scimitar at the adventurer. It was apparently not the first time a scimitar was thrown at an innocent party, as the thief eventually made his way to a shrine to Ilmater in Athkatlas Waukeens Promenade to pray for forgiveness for attacks and the illicit profession. Yet again, when Abdel came across Habib at Ilmaters shrine, the thief threw a handful of gold coins at the adventurer and escaped, confusing him with the guard.
