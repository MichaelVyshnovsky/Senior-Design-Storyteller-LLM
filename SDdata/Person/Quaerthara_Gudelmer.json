Iylandra and Raeveshara Gudelmer were the oldest siblings, while Nilunele was Quaertharas older twin. The sisters lived with their father, Albaerlus, in the family mansion, the famously haunted and beautiful Dancing Dolphins House in Athkatlas resplendent Gem District. All four sisters were professional escorts and guides to Athkatla, offering their services to visitors in need of companionship. The Gudelmer sisters were well-known in Athkatlas upper classes through their social status and professional life. Those visitors who requested Quaerthara, or any other specific sister, had to wait for up to three days on average for the first availability."
