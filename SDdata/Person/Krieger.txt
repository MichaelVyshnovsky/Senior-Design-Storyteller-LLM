'''Krieger''' was a [[deep gnome]] councilor of the city of [[Blingdenstone]] in [[1370 DR]]. Before becoming a councilor, he was a burrow warden. 

==Personality==
Krieger was a very independent individual, even for a former burrow warden and indulged in unorthodox strategies. His former work made Krieger very conscious of all the dangers of the [[Underdark]] and his skills were very useful for his later position as councilor, especially because of the threat of vengeance by the [[Menzoberranzan]] [[drow]] after their war against [[Mithral Hall]]. 

==History==
For a time, he was a burrow warden until he become a councilor for the city after the war with the drow of Menzoberranzan.
