Ashaba was a water wizard and the first Lord of Shadowdale after driving the drow out of the Twisted Tower in 906 DR. Ashaba ruled Shadowdale for thirty four years until 940 DR.
Ashaba created the Pendant of Ashaba, to be used to determine the rightful lord of Shadowdale.
Ashaba ultimately changed himself into a water elemental in 940 DR. and merged with the river that he gave his name to, the River Ashaba.
