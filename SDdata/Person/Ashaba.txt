'''Ashaba''' was a water wizard and the first Lord of [[Shadowdale]] after driving the [[drow]] out of the [[Twisted Tower]] in [[906 DR]]. Ashaba ruled Shadowdale for thirty four years until [[940 DR]].

Ashaba created the ''[[Pendant of Ashaba]]'', to be used to determine the rightful lord of Shadowdale.

Ashaba ultimately changed himself into a [[water elemental]] in 940 DR. and merged with the river that he gave his name to, the [[River Ashaba]].
