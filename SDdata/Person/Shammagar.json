        "mainbody": "Shammagar was a black dragon who lived on an island in the Trackless Sea.\nDuring the Rage of Dragons of , Shammagar and the green dragon Claugiyliamatar attacked the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt, targeting the hordes food supplies and amassed treasure. Shammagar himself drove the orcs out of the ancient dwarven stronghold of Melairrin beneath Mount Sar in the Sword Mountains range.\nSeveral centuries later, the half-elven Harper Asilther Graelor managed to infiltrate Shammagars lair beneath Mount Sar and abscond with most of his hoard. Shammagar was outraged and immediately abandoned Melairrin for a new island lair in the Trackless Sea.\nThe frost giant adventurer Harshnag the Grim, who came to reside in the stronghold of Melairrin long after Shammagar had quit the place, reported encountering half&ndashblack dragons of orcish ancestry in the depths below&mdashpossibly the progeny of Shammagar himself."
