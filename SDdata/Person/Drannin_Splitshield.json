        "mainbody": "rannin Splitshield was an evil dwarf of Mithral Hall during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nDrannin was a self-serving individual who believed that, due to his heritage, he was owed better than he received. When he didnt receive the accolades, he began to see everyone in his way as the problem, trying to keep him down, and he vowed to do whatever it took to turn the tables. Drannin believed that with Orcsplitter in his possession he could establish himself as a powerful lord among his clan, and finally win the respect he thought he deserved.\nDrannins most prized possession was a shield guardian. He stole the amulet that controlled it from a sorcerer some years back.\nLike his cousin Gargosh Blusterhelm, Drannin was intent on claiming the legendary axe Orcsplitter. In 1491 DR, he devised a new plan dupe his cousin Gargosh into finding the axe for him.\nSo, just after Gargosh gained the support of the Lords Alliance and hired some adventurers to search for the axe in the Halls of the Hunting Axe in the Dessarin Valley, Drannin kidnapped his cousin and replaced him with a doppelganger loyal to him.\nAt last, at the tomb of Torhild Flametongue, Drannin and his cohorts showed up in front of the adventurers to claim the prize but the adventurers easily defeated them."
