Yani Pavani managed to hear about the new ownership of the keep and rushed her caravan to the hamlet. She eagerly offered her decorator skills and merchandise from all across the Realms to the Hero to decorate his new home. She offered a stunning first-time client discount on decorating the Stronghold– merely five hundred [[gold]] pieces; however, she inflated the price and could've charged significantly less.\n\nTo counter the chilly northern winter and cold stone, she offered a variety of area rugs: oriental weave decorated with delicate flowers, purple shaggy rugs–the height of fashion in [[Waterdeep]], red squares, round blue, and, of course, animal hides. She offered a wide variety of fanciful armoires styled to resemble ancient [[Netherese]] designs, chests, desks, and even [[coffin]]s. Surprisingly enough, her favorite merchandise was a throne. Yani insisted that the Hero needed one as the new Lord of the castle. She tried to have the adventurer purchase her most expensive piece decorated with [[displacer beast]] fur. She was especially fond of [[gnomish]] [[Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodle]]s from [[Yellow Hills]], but despite her eagerness, she also offered less eccentric seatings, floor cushions, and tables.\n\nThere were many rumors of how exactly the Hero decorated his Stronghold, but one thing was true, Yani Pavani promised to deliver a very special piece of decoration for the Hero and later decided to settle in Liam's Hold, along with her flatulent blue [[ox]] [[Kizo]], for a little while.",
        "Description": "Yani Pavani was a large woman with dusky skin and a southern accent. Her brightly-colored clothes were garish, evidently imported from the nations to the south of the [[Sword Coast]]. Yani's excitement and eagerness often left her sweaty, at a loss of breath, flushed her round face and many chins as red as a ripe [[tomato]].",
        "Personality": "Yani's personality was as large as her frame. The overly-dramatic woman spoke with flare, referring to herself in the third person. She disliked \"rustic\" style and burned with passion for decorating homes and castles with the finest (and most expensive) furniture and art pieces. She dramatically expressed her disappointment at whatever choice her customers made, just to try and upsell another piece of decoration later.",
