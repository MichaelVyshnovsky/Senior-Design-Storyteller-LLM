        "mainbody": "ani Pavani was an eccentric interior decorator and a merchant who operated in the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR.\nYani Pavani was a large woman with dusky skin and a southern accent. Her brightly-colored clothes were garish, evidently imported from the nations to the south of the Sword Coast. Yanis excitement and eagerness often left her sweaty, at a loss of breath, flushed her round face and many chins as red as a ripe tomato.\nYanis personality was as large as her frame. The overly-dramatic woman spoke with flare, referring to herself in the third person. She disliked \"rustic\" style and burned with passion for decorating homes and castles with the finest (and most expensive) furniture and art pieces. She dramatically expressed her disappointment at whatever choice her customers made, just to try and upsell another piece of decoration later.\nYani claimed to have come from Neverwinter but then refused to acknowledge the Wailing Death plague that was ravaging the city at the time, being afraid to lose clients were they to think Yani could carry the deadly disease. She also claimed to be from southern Amn and to have attended a four-year decorating school.\nIn the , an abandoned keep known as the Stronghold of Liams Hold was gifted to the Hero of Daggerford as a reward for his heroic actions in service of the humble rural community. Yani Pavani managed to hear about the new ownership of the keep and rushed her caravan to the hamlet. She eagerly offered her decorator skills and merchandise from all across the Realms to the Hero to decorate his new home. She offered a stunning first-time client discount on decorating the Stronghold– merely five hundred gold pieces however, she inflated the price and couldve charged significantly less.\nTo counter the chilly northern winter and cold stone, she offered a variety of area rugs oriental weave decorated with delicate flowers, purple shaggy rugs–the height of fashion in Waterdeep, red squares, round blue, and, of course, animal hides. She offered a wide variety of fanciful armoires styled to resemble ancient Netherese designs, chests, desks, and even coffins. Surprisingly enough, her favorite merchandise was a throne. Yani insisted that the Hero needed one as the new Lord of the castle. She tried to have the adventurer purchase her most expensive piece decorated with displacer beast fur. She was especially fond of gnomish Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodles from Yellow Hills, but despite her eagerness, she also offered less eccentric seatings, floor cushions, and tables.\nThere were many rumors of how exactly the Hero decorated his Stronghold, but one thing was true, Yani Pavani promised to deliver a very special piece of decoration for the Hero and later decided to settle in Liams Hold, along with her flatulent blue ox Kizo, for a little while."
