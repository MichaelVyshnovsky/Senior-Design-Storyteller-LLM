'''Dulahey''' was a sailor on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Par asked of [[Kalach-Cha]] to investigate the trouble in his house. The Kalach-Cha would find Dulahey arguing with his sailors, who were robbing the place, then attack. Once Dulahey and the pirates are defeated, Par would reward the Kalach-Cha with some potions.
