        "mainbody": "yerhite Verther was a Calishite silk merchant just before the Tyranny of Dragons.\nThe merchant was not a scrupulous individual. When unhinged, he exploded in anger and fury. \nAt the start of the Tyranny of Dragons in 1489 DR, Nyerhite traveled to Waterdeep with a load of Calishite silk, which unknown to him was infested with worms. Unsuspectingly, he journeyed in a great caravan full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures to help bring Tiamat into Toril from the Abyss."
