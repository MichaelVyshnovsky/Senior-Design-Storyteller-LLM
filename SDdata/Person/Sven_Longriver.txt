'''Sven Longriver''' was a [[hin]] [[adventurer]] for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sven was born into a minor noble house that lost its land holdings after the family's lineage was debunked. By the late 15{{th}}, Sven Longriver resorted to adventuring out of necessity. He was known to offer his adventuring skills for hire in retrieval or valuable crafting components, monster bits, and gathering other types of supplies used in crafting. Sven ended up being a virtuoso of his profession, offering his services to the defenders of Neverwinter.
