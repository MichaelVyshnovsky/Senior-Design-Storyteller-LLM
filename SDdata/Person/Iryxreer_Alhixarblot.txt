Iryxreer Alhixarblot was an alhoon in Myth Drannor in the 1370s DR.
Iryxreer always tried to gain possession of the Circle of Swords spell but was always repulsed by its unique magical construct guardian, the Floating Face, or by rival alhoons that also wanted the spell.
In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, somehow the Circle of Swords activated, calling to it some adventurers via their dreams. Iryxreer sent all its troops against the adventurers, sensing it was the right time to acquire the spell.
Iryxreer directed a small army of mind-controlled monsters, mostly ogres, gargoyles, bugbears, and ettins and even two vrocks.
