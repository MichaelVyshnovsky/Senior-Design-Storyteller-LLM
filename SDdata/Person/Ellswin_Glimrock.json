I believe there is a gap in the market here for work such as my own. Permit me to descend upon you with a small sample and perhaps entice you with the possibility of establishing myself as a resident-jeweller? I look forward to meeting you in person.''|Excerpt from Ellswin Glimrock's letter}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Absolute crisis]] followed the calamity of the [[Descent]] in which Elturel was briefly plunged into the [[Nine Hells]]. Ellswin Glimrock was among the many refugees forced out of Elturel by one of the two threats, despite being a master artisan of some small renown. Seeking employ in the new home, Ellswin sent a letter of introduction and inquiry to Madame [[Omotola]] of [[The Glitter Gala]] in the Lower City, praising her dazzling shop and offering services as a resident jeweler."
