        "mainbody": "'''Pheebs Splayfoot''' was a [[hin]] businessman from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Brandobaris curse me, I should have taken that deal the first time it was offered at half today's price. I'm a sap.''|Pheebs Splayfoot}}",
        "Description": "Pheebs was a pudgy halfling man with pale skin, blue eyes, and curly black hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the [[Absolute crisis]], certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was [[saltpeter]]. Pheebs Splayfoot sought to purchase a shipment of [[barrel]]ed saltpeter from the [[dwarf|dwarvish]] trader [[Djingo]] and participated in a bidding war against [[Kaet Ling]] and [[Smiley Gheef]]. Djingo charged at least 500 [[gold piece]]s per barrel, a high price as he knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double the amount to the Gate's [[steel watcher]] foundry. Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding war ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes. Despite the loss, Gheef was hopeful for future transactions."
