'''Celia Pendrick''' was one of the Magistrates of [[Cormyr]], who worked in the towns of [[Eveningstar]] and [[Wheloon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Celia was a stout, aging [[human]] woman with hair grayed by time, and a direct and curt personality. She wore a quality Magistrate dress uniform [[dye]]d in Cormyr's purples.

==Activities==
Celia investigated criminal and cultic activities from the [[Wheloon Docks]], alongside fellow Magistrates [[Cornelius Latrimor]], [[Abella Toth]] and [[Barthold Moncrief]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Celia joined Abella and Barthold in an investigation in Eveningstar as they pursued the Wheloon escapee [[Dedryk Black]]. Magistrate Toth sent a band of adventurers from the world of [[Eberron]] to chase the cultists in the foothills of the [[Storm Horns]], which they believed was related to their quarry. When the cultists and their leader Dedryk were captured in their [[Sharran hideout (Storm Horns)|hideout]], Magistrate Barthold supervised their transportation to [[Wheloon]] for imprisonment, and Celia returned to duty in Wheloon, trying to find out how he managed to escape the prison. While Magistrate Cornelius directly handled the interrogation, the process was interrupted by an attack by the [[Shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] [[assassin]] [[Teralyn]], who managed to kill Cornelius and rescue Dedryk.
