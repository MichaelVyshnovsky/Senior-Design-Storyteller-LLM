St. Ulrach the Twice Martyred was a saint of the faith of Ilmater, the Crying God, who lived in the Delimbiyr Vale in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He built the monastery that would be named for him, the Monastery of St. Ulrach.
Ulrach earned his appellation when he died, for the second time, in defense of the Delimbiyr Vale against marauding hobgoblins commanded by a cornugon circa 1363 DR.
With his sacrifice and sainthood, Ulrachs small monastic order swelled.
