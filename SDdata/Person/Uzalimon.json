        "mainbody": "'''Uzalimon''' was the leader of a [[wizard]]ly cabal who opposed the ancient [[lich]] [[Kokrulobis]] and its evil worshipers in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Now, if you would be so kind as to leave this place the way you arrived? And please, do not touch anything. I will seal the statue behind you. Oh, and one last thing, please do not speak of the Kokrulobite cult to anyone back in Westgate. There is no need to spark a panic, after all.''|Uzalimon}}",
        "Description": "Uzalimon was a tall and imposing balding man with graying hair; however, his face remained relatively youthful.",
        "Possessions": "Uzalimon owned a house that faced the [[Market Triangle]] in Westgate. Underneath, the home hid a passageway into a sizable underground chamber that led toward the wizard's study and laboratory. The chamber was ensorcelled to appear as if it had a deep and wide water-filled moat at its center with two massive [[quelzarn]]s. This magic was intimidating but harmless, as anyone could just walk past the illusions.\n\nUzalimon employed a single servant, a feebleminded [[albino]] [[dwarf]] named [[Rupert]]. The wizard also once had a [[familiar]]. The [[bat]] was named [[Henry (familiar)|Henry]], and its body was stuffed and lovingly displayed within Uzalimon's laboratory.",
        "History": "Shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a cult sprang in Westgate that began worshiping the ancient and frightfully powerful lich Kokrulobis after they uncovered a massive magic crystal that served as the creature's prison. By unknown means, the cult's leader discovered a way of releasing Kokrulobis from its eternal prison. Uzalimon led a small cabal of wizards with whom he worked to stop threats of similar arcane nature. The group included [[Amak]], [[Susstel]], [[Payana]], and . They could not let the creature be unleashed on [[Toril]]. Uzalimon led a raid on the Kokrulobite cultists and managed to steal the lich's prison crystal. The cultists tracked the cabal to Uzalimon's hidden underground laboratory, and as they attacked, an overpowered magical trap was sprung, turning the wizard's home into smoldering ruins. All cultists had perished, but the leader â€“ [[Maliando]], who was gravely hurt and rendered amnesiac. His life was saved by a band of adventurers who entered the building to investigate the explosion.\n\nThe adventurers discovered a ''[[portal]]'' and jumped in, unknowingly allowing the cult leader to unshackle Kokrulobis via an arcane incantation. When the lich was unleashed, Uzalimon and his cabal clashed with the lich in a spell battle. It was possible that the mages died in the process, but one way or another, Kokrulobis was freed and slain, ending the lich's cult."
