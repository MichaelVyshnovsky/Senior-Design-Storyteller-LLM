        "mainbody": "Isilyx was an adult white dragon living in the Silver Marches in the late-15 century DR.\nIsilyx was in some way descended from the legendary white dragon Arveiaturace.\nAt some point Isilyx made a lair in the caverns beneath Lonely Tower. Then one day, in the late-15 century DR, a portal to the Far Realm opened within the caverns and warped the surrounding earth. This caused her caverns main exit to the surface to be sealed off. It also led to her hindquarters becoming partially merged with a nearby wall. \nWhen a group of adventurers entered the caverns on behalf of Beorunnas Well and came across Isilyx, they found that the dragon was desperate for aid but unwilling to ask out of pride. Feigning confidence out of both anger and embarrassment, Isilyx offered to grant the adventurers their lives if they could free her. \nAccounts differ on how this was carried out, but eventually the adventurers managed to free the white dragon and were rewarded her hoard for their efforts. Isilyx then proceeded to start digging her way out of the cavern through a caved-in section of wall, all while describing to the adventurers the strange supernatural occurrence that ruined her lair and led to her being trapped within it."
