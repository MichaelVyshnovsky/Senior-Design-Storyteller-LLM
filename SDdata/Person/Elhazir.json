        "Activities": "In addition to running the shop with his family, Elhazir personally enchanted weapons for sale in the store. These were usually magical [[dagger]]s that not only aided the wielder during combat, but often possessed an additional enchantment as well.",
        "Relationships": "Elhazir was the proud father of six daughters, all of whom worked in the shop with him.",
        "Possessions": "As one might expect for someone who owned a shop specializing in exotic goods, Elhazir owned an impressive variety of magical items. These included an ''[[ring of spell turning|earring of spell turning]]'' and an ancient [[Netherese]] ''[[ring of spell storing]]'' that included the spells ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'' as well as a pair of priestly healing spells."
