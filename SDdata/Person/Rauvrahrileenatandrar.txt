'''Rauvrahrileenatandrar''', or '''Rauvrahreene''' for short, was a [[steel dragon]] who lived on the continent of [[Arandron]] on [[Toril]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-28 - Velsaertirden}}

==Relations==
Her mother was [[Malavauvrantarandra]] (Malavauvra), an ailing [[dragon aging|ancient wyrm]], and her father was [[Phaudrantanthildrar]] (Phaudron), a withdrawn and focused scholar. Rauvrahreene was hatched in the same clutch as her brothers [[Torthalindrarron]] (Torthal) and [[Velsaertirden]]. This was Malavauvra's final clutch, and the other siblings died as hatchlings or within their first year.

==Lair==
The family laired within the castle of [[Steelspires]], which had been built for them by [[stone giant]]s. It stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of [[Haunvaerune]]. However, Rauvrahreene kept a separate lair elsewhere.

==Personality==
Rauvrahreene was a ruthless and greedy dragon who desired to dominate lesser creatures, as she saw them. She thought of [[human]]s as nothing more than beasts and tools, to be used, toyed with, and ultimately eaten or otherwise disposed of as suited her plans.

==History==
Of their mother's final clutch, only Rauvrahreene, Torthal, and Velsaert survived. They grew to become "dragonets", capable of taking [[human]] form and switching forms with ease, and, encouraged by their mother, explored the neighboring human city of Haunvaerune. Rauvrahreene formed her views of humans during these visits.

Some time around the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], Phaudron went off on another expedition seeking a rare [[material component]]. While he was away, Rauvrahreene discovered his notes on his arcane experiments, made copies, and slipped away to her own lair to devise a way to reverse her father's spells. When Phaudron returned weary to Steelspires, she was waiting—Rauvrahreene secretly cast the reversed spells and slew her father. She then murdered her mother in her sleep the same way and seized control of Steelspires, turning it against her brothers by filling it with dragon-slaying traps. While she was doing so, Torthal returned to Steelspires to speak with Phaudron and was nearly killed by one of the traps. Gloating, Rauvrahreene openly admitted her guilt to her dying brother. Velsaertirden, also returning and overhearing this, attacked her, but in the chaos of battle, she escaped, injured but alive, while Torthal was obliterated. Afterward, the grieving Velsaertirden searched the castle, turned Rauvrahreene's traps against her as best he could in case she returned, and abandoned Steelspires forever, traveling to [[Faerûn]].

But Rauvrahreene would one day follow him there. Almost six centuries later, the two dragons ran into each other again. Rauvrahreene was posing as '''Lady Ambrele Morarshar''' of [[House Morarshar]] in [[Selgaunt]], [[Sembia]], bring wealth and success to the house. Velsaertirden, meanwhile, was posing as a [[Harper]] agent called Shalant Mornwind, operating undercover in Selgaunt. The two dragons fought, destroying not only Morarshar Hall but several neighboring buildings and much of the street, and causing the deaths of the Morarshars, their employees, and the Harpers in the process. Rauvrahreene escaped once again, badly wounded and this time to another [[plane]]. Meanwhile, her spells, meant to slay Velsaert, had aged him by some three hundred years.

Velsaertirden survived into the late 15{{th}} century, achieving the status of [[greatwyrm]]. But so too, perhaps, did Rauvrahreene.
