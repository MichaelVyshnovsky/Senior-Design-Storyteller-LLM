Maisby was a human cook and houseservant who lived near Eveningstar in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
Maisby had shoulder-length brown hair, brown eyes, and a light skin tone. She typically wore a neat black and white short dress and leggings.
Around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Maisby worked as a cook at the Midler farmstead, a large home west of Eveningstar. When the drow attacked in force, Maisby managed to escape the attention of the cruel priestess of Lolth Vicala Szind by hiding in the shed behind the home. She waited there for a night and a day, then slipped away back to Eveningstar. There, she reported what had happened, including that the Midler family had actually been taken alive and kept as hostages, rather than killed. The Evenor Helena Falagon took care of the distraught Maisby while Vicben Arroway and another Purple Dragon investigated, but they did not return. Following that, a team of adventurers were sent in to rescue the Midlers.
Later, Maisby found work as a housemaid at the mysterious Sable Manor, alongside Saunders, Willem, and Scraps. She was fortunately not immediately targeted by the villainous vampire Lord Sable when he made his return only a few days after her arrival, with Sir Ebermund Harker and the other guests suffering instead. Instead, she was kept busy cleaning and maintaining the mansion while dark deeds were performed in the background.
