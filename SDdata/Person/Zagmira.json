        "mainbody": "'''Zagmira''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She led a group of her fellow Red Wizards into [[Omu]] in [[Chult]] in search of the ''[[Soulmonger]]''.",
        "Description": "Zagmira appeared as a young 18-year-old woman with half her face withered and aged. This was the side-effect of a wicked [[ritual]] she undertook to inhabit her granddaughter's youthful body, thus prolonging her own lifespan. Being a Red Wizard, Zagmira wore red robes and had a shaven head.",
        "Possessions": "Zagmira had with her at all times her [[spellbook]], which she used to cast her prepared spells.",
        "History": "Under the orders of [[Szass Tam]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] sent a group of Red Wizards into the lost city of Omu with the belief that the ''Soulmonger'' could be found amid the ruins. After many attacks by the [[yuan-ti]] populating the city, only four Red Wizards survived, among them Zagmira, the highest-ranking one still alive. Afterward, Zagmira and her group could be found in the ruined city of Omu seeking ''puzzle cubes'' to unlock the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]."
