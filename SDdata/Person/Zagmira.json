        "mainbody": "Zagmira was a Red Wizard of Thay in the late 15 century DR. She led a group of her fellow Red Wizards into Omu in Chult in search of the Soulmonger.\nZagmira appeared as a young 18-year-old woman with half her face withered and aged. This was the side-effect of a wicked ritual she undertook to inhabit her granddaughters youthful body, thus prolonging her own lifespan. Being a Red Wizard, Zagmira wore red robes and had a shaven head.\nZagmira had with her at all times her spellbook, which she used to cast her prepared spells.\nUnder the orders of Szass Tam, Valindra Shadowmantle sent a group of Red Wizards into the lost city of Omu with the belief that the Soulmonger could be found amid the ruins. After many attacks by the yuan-ti populating the city, only four Red Wizards survived, among them Zagmira, the highest-ranking one still alive. Afterward, Zagmira and her group could be found in the ruined city of Omu seeking puzzle cubes to unlock the Tomb of the Nine Gods."
