'''Osari Minhiro''' was an old [[samurai]] of [[Tifuido]] in [[Wa]].

==Personality==
After the death of his daughters, Minhiro became cynical. He was terrified by large bodies of water.

==Powers==
Minhiro was a protege of Ababuio and he always miraculously escaped death.

==History==
Minhiro was born to the [[Osari clan]] in the village of [[Osata]] on the [[Fochu Peninsula]].

At a young age, during a sea voyage with his parents, [[wako]] pirates attacked the ship and only Minhiro survived thanks to a jellyfish sent by [[Ababuio]], the deity of good luck.

He married the powerful [[wu jen]] [[Toshi]] and together they served at the court of his nephew, [[Osari Daizan]], [[daimyo]] of the city of [[Tifuido]].

After the deaths of all of his daughters before they reached 16 years old around [[1348 DR]], Minhiro retired to live alone and divorced from Toshi, who instead went to work in the village of [[Seinin]].

In [[1358 DR]], a number of strange killings plagued Fochu and Toshi was killed. Soon after, her ghost appeared to Minhiro in a dream explaining that she had been killed by the minions of [[Za-Jikku]] and asked her ex-husband's help to stop the evil.

First, Minhiro told everything to his nephew but Daizan acted too slowly and Minhiro decided to act without the government's support.
Under Toshi's instructions, Minhiro traveled to far [[Tempat Larang]], where he asked for the help of an adventuring party sent there by the Emperor of [[Shou Lung]].

Minhiro said that Toshi had told him that he needed their help to travel to [[Qui]] and stop Za-Jikku, a potential menace to all [[Kara-Tur]]. They had to enter the [[demiplane]] of Qui in order to stop the evil.
