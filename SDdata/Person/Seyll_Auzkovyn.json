        "mainbody": "'''Seyll Auzkovyn''' was a [[drow]] high priestess of [[Eilistraee]] and advisor to Lord [[Dessaer]] of [[Elventree]] in [[Cormanthor]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Seyll was young, less than 100 years old as of 1372 DR. She wore a lady's riding outfit with a knee-length skirt and a green jacket over a cream blouse. She also had matching knee-high boots. She wore [[mail]] marked with the symbol of Eilistraee and bore a sword enchanted against [[evil]] with a hilt that formed a working [[flute]].",
        "History": "Seyll was a former priestess of [[Lolth]] who converted to Eilistraee. It was implied that one of the reasons Seyll converted was because her daughter was killed for failing some senseless test provided by Lolth. At first, Seyll told herself it because she'd been too weak to live. She was later captured by people of the surface, which was when she heard the message of Eilistraee. Some time in the 1360s DR, she settled in Elventree. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the houseless Lolthite priestess [[Halisstra Melarn]] was captured by the forces of Elventree. Seyll attempted to convert Halisstra to her faith by sharing her message and placing a measure of unexpected trust in her. That trust was partially misguided, however, as Halisstra slew Seyll on the way to an Eilistraeean gathering, but Halisstra remembered her experience with Seyll and later converted to Eilistraee herself.\n\nHalisstra later had a vision of Seyll that prompted her to begin seeking the [[Crescent Blade]] in order to kill Lolth.\n\nSeyll's spirit appeared to Halisstra on the [[Astral Plane]]. Seyll had abandoned [[Arvandor]] for Eilistraee and for Halisstra. Seyll protected Halisstra from the return of Lolth. In the process, she was destroyed and sent to oblivion."
