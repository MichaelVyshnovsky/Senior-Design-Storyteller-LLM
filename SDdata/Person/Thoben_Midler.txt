Thoben Midler was a young member of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.
Thoben was a young man with blond hair, and wore a gray tunic.
Thoben was the second son of Ricnan Midler and Jandove Midler, and younger brother of Normon.
During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.
Thoben was kept in the cellar of the house under guard alongside his grandparents Wilaver and Caryn.
