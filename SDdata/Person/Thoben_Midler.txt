==Description==
Thoben was a young man with blond hair, and wore a gray [[tunic]].

==Relationships==
Thoben was the second son of [[Ricnan Midler]] and [[Jandove Midler]], and younger brother of [[Normon Midler|Normon]].

==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.

Thoben was kept in the cellar of the house under guard alongside his grandparents [[Wilaver Chandler|Wilaver]] and [[Caryn Chandler|Caryn]].
