'''Gorun Pricebreaker''' was a [[dwarf]] merchant of the [[Sword Coast North]] and the proprietor of the [[Broken Crown]] inn on the [[High Road]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Gorun purchased the Broken Crown in the late 1470s DR and reopened the establishment as trade and traffic along the High Road near [[Neverwinter]] became active once again.

The inn became a safe haven for travelers along the road near [[Raven Cliff Beach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, as activity by the cutthroat [[Blackdagger Bandits]] forced many of them to seek safety and protection. Gorun sold goods and supplies to those who came through.
