'''Mojos al-Yunqani''' was the Imam of [[Ajayib]] in the [[Pearl Cities]] region of [[west Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}} 

==Description==
Mojos was an elderly man in 1367 DR.

==Personality==
His sense of reason provided a fine balance to the caliph's adventurous spirit.

==Activities==
Mojos led the followers of [[Selan]] in Ajayib. He also served as an advisor to Caliph [[Halima al-Wahsi]], often urging her to focus more on matters of state than any physical threats the savages of [[Al-Suqut Mountains]] might present. Mojos was wary of any ambassadors from the other Pearl Cities whom he believed posed a threat to Ajayib.
