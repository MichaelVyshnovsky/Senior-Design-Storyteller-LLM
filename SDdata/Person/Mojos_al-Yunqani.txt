Mojos was an elderly man in 1367 DR.
His sense of reason provided a fine balance to the caliphs adventurous spirit.
Mojos led the followers of Selan in Ajayib. He also served as an advisor to Caliph Halima al-Wahsi, often urging her to focus more on matters of state than any physical threats the savages of Al-Suqut Mountains might present. Mojos was wary of any ambassadors from the other Pearl Cities whom he believed posed a threat to Ajayib.
