Imam '''Yola min Zann''' was a [[gnome]] ''[[Midani dictionary|qadi]]'' living in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Yola was the ''qadi'' for the entire [[Grand Bazaar]] and surrounding area, which also happened to be the part of Huzuz with the greatest amount of crime. Though initially ridiculed for her short stature, Yola quickly earned a reputation for being a hard judge who treated truthful criminals with more fairness that those who lied. Several attempts were made on her life because of this, but she was able to thwart them all.

Yola desired marriage but had yet to find a suitable gnome husband. She secretely fantasized about being swept off her feet by a gnomish [[desert rider]] for wild romance in the deep deserts of [[Zakhara]].

==Possessions==
Yola owned a valuable [[ruby]] brooch, a blow gun, a ''[[ring of protection]]'', a ''[[rod of smiting]]'', and a flask of ''[[oil of great devotion]]''.
