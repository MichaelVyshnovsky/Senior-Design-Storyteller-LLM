Human lich
Leneka Jheth was a Zhent lich.
Leneka was a powerful lich. At some point, someone defeated Leneka and transformed the lich into a grisgol. This grisgol survived the siege of Zhentil Keep by the forces of Cyric in 1368â€“1369 DR and proved a bane to adventurers trying to plunder the ruins.
