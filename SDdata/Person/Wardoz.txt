Wardoz was an evil wizard that lived in the Kingdom of Mertwig around the 14 century DR.
His repertoire of known spells included charm person and lightning bolt.
When King Mertwig was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth and treasure. During their journey to claim the throne, the would-be heirs of King Mertwig encountered and fought Wardoz.
