'''Merothrax the Greedy''' was a [[white dragon]] living on the slopes of [[Icespire Peak]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was described as being  "as stupid as he is greedy", by [[Hazrah Stormhammer]].

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] acquired his aid by giving him some of the [[mithral]] they were stealing from a [[Icespire Peak#Notable Locations|mine]] owned by the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Icehammer]].

When the [[Lords' Alliance]] made the decision to retake the Icehammer mine for its rightful dwarven owners, Hazrah Stormhammer worked with a [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|renowed adventurer]] to slay Merothrax and follow through with their plan.
