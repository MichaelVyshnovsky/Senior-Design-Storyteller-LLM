Merothrax the Greedy was a white dragon living on the slopes of Icespire Peak as of the late 15 century DR.
He was described as being  "as stupid as he is greedy", by Hazrah Stormhammer.
In the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon acquired his aid by giving him some of the mithral they were stealing from a mine owned by the dwarves of Clan Icehammer.
When the Lords Alliance made the decision to retake the Icehammer mine for its rightful dwarven owners, Hazrah Stormhammer worked with a renowed adventurer to slay Merothrax and follow through with their plan.
