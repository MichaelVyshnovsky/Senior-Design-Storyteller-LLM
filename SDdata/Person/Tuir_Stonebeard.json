        "mainbody": "'''Tuir \"Stonebeard\", Blood of Helban''' was a [[dwarf]] ruler and [[Deep King]] of the dwarven kingdom of [[Roldilar]] in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faer√ªn]] in the 7{{th}} century DR.{{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|16-17}}",
        "Personality": "Tuir was stoic and grim by nature, and slow to laugh. These traits earned him the nickname \"Stonebeard\".",
        "History": "Tuir was a descendant of [[Helban]], whom he honored in his name.\n\nWhen the [[orc]] nation of [[Vastar]], in the lands later known as the Vast, fell into civil war in the [[572 DR|Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]], dwarves began to encroach from the west, spreading underground and applying increasing pressure on the orcs.{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|90}}\n\nWorking with [[human]]s and [[elves]], the dwarves secretly developed \"[[orcslayer]]\", a [[steel]] toxic to orcs. Lord Tuir Stonebeard requested over a thousand orcslayer weapons and Master Smith [[Fyrfar Smokebeard]] and [[High Old One]] [[Turbaern]], together with the human mage [[Beldossan]] and the elven sorceress [[Aleratha Ilnatar]] worked hard over several years to forge and enchant them. Among these was the [[short sword]] ''[[Sarghathuld]]'', forged in the [[605 DR|Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR]], and given to the dwarven warrior [[Ulnorn]].\n\nIn the [[610 DR|Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]], the invading dwarves, armed with orcslayer weapons, toppled Vastar and slew [[Orc-King]] [[Grimmerfang]] at their capital, [[Mount Grimmerfang]]. The victorious dwarves claimed the surface lands for themselves and that same year Deep King Tuir Stonebeard founded the kingdom of Roldilar, the Realm of Glimmering Swords. Tuir placed his throne deep beneath Mount Grimmerfang and held court from there.\n\nIn the [[645 DR|Year of the Costly Gift, 645 DR]], the [[archmage]] [[Maskyr One-Eye|Maskyr]] came to Mount Grimmerfang to seek audience with Deep King Tuir. He asked Tuir's price for [[Maskyr's Eye|a vale]] within the domain of Roldilar that he wished to make his home. The Roldilarren Court fell silent but Maskyr waited patiently, quietly leaning on his staff and meeting the king's gaze, as Tuir thought it over. Tuir did not want to yield any land to any human, particular wizards whom he distrusted, but he feared the archmage's power. At last, he made his offer: \"The vale is yours, from rim to rim and beneath the grass as deep as four men stand upon each other's shoulders, so long as ye dig so as to remain within the valley's borders, upon one condition only. Pluck out thy right eye and give it to me, here and now, and the vale is thine.\" To the shock of all present, without hesitation, Maskyr did just that. Tuir respected Maskyr for the deed, having thought that no-one would ever do it. He kept the bargain and granted him the land. He also ordered that no dwarf trespass in the vale nor disturb the archmage. Maskyr then went and dwelled there, erecting [[Maskyr's Tower]] for his home.\n\nOthers followed, and this marked the beginning of permanent [[human]] settlement in the Vast.\n\nRoldilar enjoyed only about forty years of real peace under Deep King Tuir before it was engulfed by hordes of resurgent orcs in the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]].\n\nTuir was the last deep king whose dominion spread over the surface lands, and the last to be well-known there."
