'''Allessia Faithhammer''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Helm]] from [[Secomber]].

==History==
Allessia was summoned to [[Baldur's Gate]] from her home in Secomber by her mentor, [[Huros]]. She came to the city in hopes of defending it from the threat posed by [[Eldrith the Betrayer]] and her Dark Alliance. However, by the time of her arrival, Eldrith had already been defeated and her [[Onyx Tower]] banished from [[Toril]]. Instead, she found herself pitted against the designs of [[Mordoc SeLanmere]] as well as other nefarious forces in the [[Western Heartlands]].

She had the option of working for the [[Church of Helm]] in Baldur's Gate, which was run by Huros, and of donating large sums of [[gold]] to the church to fund various projects, including an orphanage, additional fortifications to the city walls, and a warship to help defend the harbor of Baldur's Gate. Allessia also had the option of traveling to an unholy mausoleum on the church's orders. There, she would have to defeat a small army of [[undead]] creatures led by [[Goreth Vileblack]], a cleric of [[Cyric]].

==Personality==
Allessia was very devoted to the Church of Helm and followed its doctrine of shielding the innocent from harm. She saw her work as a divine duty and for the greater good.

==Abilities==

As a cleric of good alignment, Allessia could [[turn undead]], either sending lesser undead fleeing or disintegrating them completely. She could use [[spell]]s like ''[[bless]]'' and could learn the ability to summon an avatar of Helm's sword, ''[[Ever Watchful]]''. Allessia could also become adept in numerous forms of non-magical combat. Her spells mainly consisted of healing, defense, and enchantment.
