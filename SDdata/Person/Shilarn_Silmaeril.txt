Shilarn Silmaeril was a human and one of the original Lords of Waterdeep. Along with Baeron, she overthrew the Lords Magister Ehlemm Zoar and Lhorar Gildeggh to restore the government of Waterdeep.
Shilarn married Baeron, also a Lord of Waterdeep. They had a daughter, Lhestyn the Masked Lady, who later became an Open Lord of Waterdeep.
After the Council of Guildmasters seized power in Waterdeep in 1256 DR, most of the Lords of Waterdeep were eliminated because their identities, which were supposed to have remained secret, had been compromised. Only Shilarn and Baeron  are known to have survived this purge. In 1273 DR, they both entered the court of the Lords Magister Ehlemm Zoar and Lhorar Gildeggh, who were in power in the city at the time, and demanded that they leave the city. When they refused, Shilarn struck them down and killed them using her magic. Baeron revealed his identity, restoring the original form of government and becoming the Open Lord.
When Baeron died of fever in 1308 DR, Shilarn killed herself by jumping onto his funeral pyre.
