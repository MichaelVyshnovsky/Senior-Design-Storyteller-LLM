        "mainbody": "'''Lamantha''' was a [[human]] [[necromancer]] who dwelt in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was the proprietor of a [[Lamantha's mortuary|mortuary]] that provided a variety of macabre services.",
        "Personality": "She was presumed to be insane, and was willing to commit many heinous and horrific acts against living [[humanoid]]s. She was impatient with other people, but not always hostile. On occasion, she was happy to encounter another living person if it meant that she could converse with them about interesting topics, notably current events in the [[Material Plane]]. She might even offer such people a safe place to stay, but she would lose interest in them within a couple of days.",
        "Activities": "Lamantha worked as a mortician and a taxidermist, and was also involved in preparing the victims of religious executions&mdash;known as \"[[Funeral (Evernight)|funerals]]\"&mdash;carried out by the [[Temple of Filth]]. In addition to running her business&mdash;which provided services to the [[undead]] of Evernight that ranged from \"healing\" to cosmetics to sedation of living people&mdash;she devoted herself to researching and observing the undead inhabitants' growth and change.",
        "Relationships": "Lamantha was one of very few living people allowed to live in Evernight. The city's ruling [[ghoul]]s left her alone in exchange for the services she provided at her mortuary.",
        "History": "As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, no one was sure of Lamantha's true purpose for staying in Evernight."
