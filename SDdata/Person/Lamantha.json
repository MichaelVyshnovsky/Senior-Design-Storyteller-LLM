        "mainbody": "amantha was a human necromancer who dwelt in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR. She was the proprietor of a mortuary that provided a variety of macabre services.\nShe was presumed to be insane, and was willing to commit many heinous and horrific acts against living humanoids. She was impatient with other people, but not always hostile. On occasion, she was happy to encounter another living person if it meant that she could converse with them about interesting topics, notably current events in the Material Plane. She might even offer such people a safe place to stay, but she would lose interest in them within a couple of days.\nLamantha worked as a mortician and a taxidermist, and was also involved in preparing the victims of religious executions&mdashknown as \"funerals\"&mdashcarried out by the Temple of Filth. In addition to running her business&mdashwhich provided services to the undead of Evernight that ranged from \"healing\" to cosmetics to sedation of living people&mdashshe devoted herself to researching and observing the undead inhabitants growth and change.\nLamantha was one of very few living people allowed to live in Evernight. The citys ruling ghouls left her alone in exchange for the services she provided at her mortuary.\nAs of , no one was sure of Lamanthas true purpose for staying in Evernight."
