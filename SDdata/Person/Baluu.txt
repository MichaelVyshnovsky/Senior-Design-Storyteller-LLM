'''Baluu''' was a [[pangolin katanga]] [[sorcerer]] from the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]] active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Baluu was a reluctant hero, pessimistic and cowardly by nature.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Tribe of the Wise Ones]] became aware of a looming threat. The leader of the dreaded [[spider katanga]], the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] was swollen with a thousand children ready to overflow the jungles. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the [[Fire Mountain]]. Baluu was assigned to travel with a group of experienced heroes of the jungle despite him being significantly less powerful than those in the group. Baluu's band was heading into the spider katanga caverns, past the living quarters, and straight into the most dangerous part of the lair â€“ the nest to face the Mother.

It was unknown if Baluu survived the battle, but the Mother of a Thousand Young was defeated, and heroes returned to the [[Village of the Wise Ones]] for their reward and facilitated the clean-up and nature's healing.
