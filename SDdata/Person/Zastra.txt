|Zastra, on spotting Cormyrean forces
}}
==Description==
Zastra had dark skin and shoulder-length black hair. She wore a set of [[leather armor]], and used her fists to fight instead of any weapon.

==Personality==
Zastra was fiercely (or perhaps desperately) defensive of what little she had in the prison, and refused to let any of it be lost.

==History==

}}
Zastra was condemned to Wheloon Prison for regular criminal activities, not [[Sharran]] worship. She set about forming her own gang in the prison, and resisted both the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]] and the [[Cormyr]]ean forces that fought to take control of the prison.
