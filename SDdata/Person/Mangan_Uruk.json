        "History": "Mangan held the position of Iron Lord as of [[1479 DR]]. Around this time, he met with [[Mario Bez]], [[Aoth Fezim]], [[Cera Eurthos]], and [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]] in order to see how long it would take for [[Storm of Vengeance (ship)|their ship]] to take flight. The warlord told the companions how dire the unfolding situation might be, as a messenger [[sparrow]] mysteriously died whilst trying to explain what was going on. Uruk was still in his position as of [[1489 DR]]."
