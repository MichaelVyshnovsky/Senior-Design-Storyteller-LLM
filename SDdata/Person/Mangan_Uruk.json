        "mainbody": "angan Uruk was the Iron Lord of Rashemen in the 15 century DR.\nUruk was tall, muscular, and had a short whitening beard. He wore an intricately designed close-fitting padded jacket, deerskin boots and a circlet made of iron.\nMangan held the position of Iron Lord as of 1479 DR. Around this time, he met with Mario Bez, Aoth Fezim, Cera Eurthos, and Jhesrhi Coldcreek in order to see how long it would take for their ship to take flight. The warlord told the companions how dire the unfolding situation might be, as a messenger sparrow mysteriously died whilst trying to explain what was going on. Uruk was still in his position as of 1489 DR."
