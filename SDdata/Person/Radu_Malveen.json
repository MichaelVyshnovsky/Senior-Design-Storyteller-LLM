        "mainbody": "Radu Malveen was a fighter in Selgaunt.\nRadu was a member of the Malveen house.\nRadu was always a lone child. He was not interested in playing with other children, only enjoying to practice with the sword.\nIn 1345 DR, his elder brother Stannis Malveen and his mother, the sorceress Velanna Malveen, fled from Selgaunt after the former was discovered having had dealings with pirates. City officials took Radu and all his siblings out of their estate but Radu secretly went back each night.\nOne night, Stannis went back to his familys estate with his vampire master. However, Radu, despite his young age, easily slew the vampire master and Stannis decided to follow Radus will.\nRadu in later years became a businessman but, unlike his brother Laskar Malveen, who had renounced all ties with Velannas network, Radu delved in smuggling and slaving. He always carefully avoided leaving any clues pointing to him. He also worked as an assassin and duelist.\nRadu loved his family in his distorted way. He found enjoyment only in duels to the death."
