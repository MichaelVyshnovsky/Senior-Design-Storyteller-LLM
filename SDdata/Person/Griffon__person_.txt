'''Brother Griffon''' was a follower of [[Silvanus]] and the head of the [[Temple of Silvanus (Loudwater)|Temple of Silvanus]] in [[Loudwater]] as of [[1479 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/159/Menace of the Icy Spire|7}}

==Description==
Brother Griffon was stout and well-muscled. His build, coupled with his rustic sense of fashion, meant he was easily mistaken for a [[barbarian]] warrior. He had blue eyes and black hair.

==Personality==
Brother Griffon was helpful, and happy to provide wisdom or guidance especially to those seeking to travel in the High Moor, a region with which he was very familiar. He felt strong loyalties to both his people&mdash;the [[Uthgardt]] barbarians&mdash;and to the citizens of Loudwater, where he had actually been raised.

==Activities==
As the head of the Temple of Silvanus in Loudwater, Brother Griffon was a healer and religious leader who doled out the blessings of his [[deity]]. He tended to his duties in town everyday dawn and dusk, but spent the rest of his day walking in the [[Southwood]] or along the [[High Moor]]. Occasionally, he would embark on longer trips as far as [[Highstar Lake]]. He was happy to play the role of guide for [[adventurer]]s heading to the High Moor, but would caution them about the dangers of going too deep into the region.

==Relationships==
Brother Griffon was acquainted with both [[Moonfire (person)|Lady Moonfire]], the civic leader of Loudwater, and [[Curuvar the Brazen]], the town's resident wizard.

==History==
Found and adopted by a fisher from Loudwater after his [[Griffon tribe|tribe]] was wiped out, Brother Griffon grew up torn between his heritage and his adoptive home. This conflict led him into the faith of Silvanus as a way to bridge the gap between his barbaric and civilized sides.

By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, he was in charge of Silvanus's temple in Loudwater, and was the most knowledgeable person in town about the geography and history of the High Moor. In late summer of that year, an unnaturally early winter settled on the [[Gray Vale]] and local farmers petitioned Brother Griffon to help save them. While Brother Griffon understood that a bad winter was not inherently an evil thing, he recognized the early onset as a perversion of the natural order that had to be corrected.
