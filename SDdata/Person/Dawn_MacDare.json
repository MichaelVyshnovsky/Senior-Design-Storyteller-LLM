        "mainbody": "'''Dawn MacDare''' was a [[bloodforge]] mage in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).\n\nDawn desired to take advantage of the [[Legendary Campaign]] leader's mission to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest. Thus, Dawn made camp in the [[Web Mountains]], from which they advanced on the Legendary Campaign forces. However, warned of the attack by the army's southern guard, the leader struck at Dawn's forces in a bloodforge battle."
