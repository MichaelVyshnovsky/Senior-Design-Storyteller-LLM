        "mainbody": "Ryngoth was an ex-Red Wizard of Thay High Priest of Kya Mordrayns cell of the Cult of the Dragon stationed in the Tower of Bones, Polyandrium of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR.\nAlong with his fellow Cult of the Dragon members, Ryngoths appearance was affected by the corrupted mythal of Myth Drannor. He gained draconic features, scaly skin, claws, and reptilian eyes. He usually wore Cultist robes over his armor. He was  tall.\nHigh Priest Ryngoth was a cruel man that reveled in the power that the Cult of the Dragon allowed him exercise. He did not value life and was cruel to the slaves. Under his lead, Myth Drannor was filled with undead servants, that he preferred to the living.\nRyngoth was power-hungry, jealous, and despised anyone who stood above him in the Cults hierarchy.\nHe decorated his room in the Tower of Bone with tapestries and art depicting bloody sacrifices.\nEven though Ryngoth was a cleric, he possessed knowledge of the arcane that allowed him to freely use magic items usable by wizards only. His knowledge of religion was as deep.\nRyngoth was able to rebuke or command undead, the skill that was utilized heavily in his service to the Cult of the Dragon. He also possessed a unique magical ability to cast a spell-like death touch once per day.\nRyngoth wore his magic +1 chainmail daily, even when out of combat. He had a dagger tucked away in case of emergencies, but his primary weapon was a masterwork heavy mace.\nHe also had a selection of magic items ready on his person, such as slippers of spider climbing that he did not hesitate to use to save his life, a wand of magic missiles with five charges, a scroll of circle of doom, a potion of cure serious wounds, and his holy symbol.\nRyngoth kept his most valuable possession in his room in the Tower of Bone, behind a magically locked and hardened picture on the wall. In the vault, he kept his platinum ingots, a diamond, a +2 pearl of wisdom, a decanter of endless water, and most importantly, a page from the Testament of Jade.\nThe only friend of Ryngoths was Zulkir, an awakened dire badger. The badger was not an evil creature but he was extremely loyal to his partner.\nRyngoth was jealous and despised Kya Mordrayn, the leader of the Cults Myth Drannor cell.\nPelendralaar, the red dragon dracolich that was allied with Kya inspired fear and awe in Ryngoth.\nRyngoth hailed from Thay where his skills in raising and controlling the dead earned him a position with the Red Wizards. Eventually, Ryngoth was indoctrinated into the Cult of the Dragon, who promised him the power he thought he deserved.\nAt some point after joining the Cult of the Dragon, Ryngoth befriended a dire badger who was recently awakened by a druid. They met at an unspecified forest and eventually moved to Cormanthor taking over the Cults operations in the Tower of Bone.\nIn Polyandrium, Ryngoth was in charge of excavating ancient crypts and finding the runes and words of power that magically sealed them from the outsiders. He used slaves, and when they died, he and his necromancers raised the fallen as zombies and skeletons to continue their work. Ryngoth personally performed executions on top of the Tower of Bone. One such execution was of Robalend Lukka, an eccentric gnome scrounger, but was stopped by a group of adventurers on a rescue mission. When his life was in danger, he used his slippers of spider climbing to run down the Towers wall to safety."
