'''Adnan al-Raqi''', also called the '''Pillar of Wisdom''', '''Master of the Invisible''', and the '''Whisper that Thunders''',

==Description==
Adnan's desire for protection left his body ailing after having [[Permanency|permanently]] cast ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', and ''[[avert evil eye]]'' upon himself. Adnan was gaunt and frail. He often wore a dark grey ''[[Midani dictionary|aba]]''. On the rare occasion when he smiled, he revealed missing teeth and blood-red gums. Adnan rarely raised his voice above a whisper.

Adnan's physical weakness masked the awesome magical power he wielded.

==Activities==
Though he was a powerful sha'ir in his own right, Adnan truly excelled at giving [[genie]]s specific commands so that they could not find ways to twist his words to suit their own needs.

Adnan constructed his wondrous [[Tower of Adnan al-Raqi|tower]] in the [[Pilgrims' District]] in a single night with the help of several tasked [[architect genie]]s. To help pass the time, Adnan began teaching gifted young sha'irs within his tower. To prove their merit, Adnan had prospective students transported deep into the [[Great Anvil]] by one of his [[djinni]] servants. They were abandoned there without food, water, or weapons of any kind. Students who were able to make it back to Adnan's tower were accepted, those who did not were never heard from again. Surviving students were typically able to enlist the aid of the [[Jann of the Haunted Lands]] in order to return safely, proving they had the ability to deal with genies successfully. Despite the inherent danger, Adnan's reputation as a sha'ir drew countless students to his door.

Adnan housed instructors and promising students within his tower.

With hopes to rekindle favor with the court, Adnan attempted to solve the mystery behind the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph's]] sterility. Certain that one of the genie lords would shed some light on the matter, Adnan sent [[Tamr na-Fia]], his most beloved student, to the [[Elemental planes]] to talk with the genie lords. Sadly, she never returned. Because of past insults committed against the genie rulers, Adnan dared not travel to the elemental planes himself to discover what happened to her.

==History==
Genies trembled at the name of Adnan al-Raqi, for the sha'ir slew, imprisoned, or humiliated more genies than any other sha'ir in recent history. Most genies wished for him to die a horrible death.

==Relationships==
Upon his arrival in Huzuz in [[1357 DR]], Adnan presented [[Grand Caliph]] Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir with the gift of a powerful [[efreeti]] named [[Hassan]] to serve as a guardian for the [[Royal Harim of Huzuz|Royal Harim]]. He once sought to curry favor with the court, but decided against that after an unfortunate encounter with [[Jiraad]], a [[noble marid]].

Adnan's [[familiar]] was an [[efreetikin]] named [[Hakim]].

==Possessions==
Through his many dealings with genies, Adnan amassed an impressive collection of magical items including many scrolls, a ''[[staff of striking]]'', a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'', a ''[[ring of genie summoning]]'', a pair of ''[[genie prison]]s'', an ''[[iron flask]]'', and wands of ''[[wand of magic missiles|magic missiles]]'', ''[[wand of frost|frost]]'', ''[[wand of conjuration|conjuration]]'', ''[[wand of lightning|lightning]]'', ''[[wand of enemy detection|enemy detection]]'', ''[[wand of paralyzation|paralyzation]]''.
