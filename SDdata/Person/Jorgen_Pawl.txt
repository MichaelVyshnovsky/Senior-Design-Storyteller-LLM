Jorgen Pawl was a member of the Cult of the Dragon during the late 15 century DR. He was commander of Xonthals Tower.
Jorgen was a strong dracolich traditionalist. He was nominated as commander of the recently conquered Xonthals Tower, a bastion of Cult traditionalists.
As a compromise with the Cults traditionalists, the reformist leader Severin gave the blue dragon mask to Jorgen to examine. However, Jorgens second-in-command Iskander betrayed the Cult to the Council of Waterdeep.
Jorgen understood Iskanders feelings but he was not ready to betray the Cult, so when Iskanders treachery was unveiled, Jorgen ordered his death. Soon after, he was presumed killed by a band of adventurers sent by the Council in response to a message from Iskander.
