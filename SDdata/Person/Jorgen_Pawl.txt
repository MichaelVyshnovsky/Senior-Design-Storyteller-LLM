'''Jorgen Pawl''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was commander of [[Xonthal's Tower]].

==History==
Jorgen was a strong [[dracolich]] traditionalist. He was nominated as commander of the recently conquered Xonthal's Tower, a bastion of Cult traditionalists.

As a compromise with the Cult's traditionalists, the reformist leader [[Severin Silrajin|Severin]] gave the ''[[blue dragon mask]]'' to Jorgen to examine. However, Jorgen's second-in-command [[Iskander]] betrayed the Cult to the [[Council of Waterdeep]].
Jorgen understood Iskander's feelings but he was not ready to betray the Cult, so when Iskander's treachery was unveiled, Jorgen ordered his death. Soon after, he was presumed killed by a band of adventurers sent by the Council in response to a message from Iskander.
