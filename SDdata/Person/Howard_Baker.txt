'''Howard Baker''' was a [[halfling]] who owned and operated a fabulous pastry shop within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Howard exemplified the ethics of Durparian merchants by never overcharging for a pastry he deemed less than perfect.

==Activities==
Howard employed ten halflings, including his wife and daughter. His culinary skills helped increase the "delight" within the City of Delights as his customers paid handsomely to sample his sweets.

Among his specialties were [[bouqthi]], a [[tart]] and sweet [[rhubarb]] pastry, a hot cherry peach pie named "the bubbler,"and an assortment of fruitcakes.

==History==
Howard was part of the notoriously rich [[Baker chaka]] of [[Durpar]]. He moved to [[Zakhara]] to help his family expand their enterprises even further.
