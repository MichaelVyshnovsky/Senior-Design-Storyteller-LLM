        "mainbody": "'''Voolad Espiral''' was a [[human]] [[druid]] of te 13{{th}} century [[DR]] who took over [[Estagund]]'s outpost city of [[Thruldar]] in [[1264 DR]]. After being slain, he rose again as a [[ghost]], and was sealed within Thruldar until the [[magic]] failed during the [[Spellplague]]. Voolad Espiral then became Beast Lord of the remaining eastern [[Lluirwood]], and the lands south of the [[Toadsquat]] foothills to the shore of the [[Gulf of Luiren]].",
        "History": "[[File:Thruldar.png|thumb|250px|''Ghostwise halflings observing Thruldar, the seat of Voolad's power.'']]\nIn the [[1264 DR|Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR]], Voolad Espiral led an army of [[plant monster]]s in a surprise attack against Thruldar, with the support of some of the [[Beastlands]]' monster chieftains. The attack caught the [[Luiren]] halflings completely by surprise, and Voolad razed the city and left most of the inhabitants dead. Within the nearby forest, various groups of [[ghostwise halflings]] noticed the dark magic that radiated from Thruldar, and upon discovering what happened staged a surprise attack in which Voolad was slain. Soon after, the powerful evil that gave Voolad his purpose made him rise again as a ghost, but the ghostwise halflings managed to seal him and his minions within Thruldar by using powerful magical wards on its walls.\n\nAware that Voolad and his minions remained sealed in Thruldar, the ghostwise halflings continued to keep an eye on the area and worked to discourage adventurers from entering and accidentally releasing the evil trapped within. This watch continued for over 100 years and was overseen by a number of the nearby ghostwise halfling tribes.\n\nDuring the Spellplague in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the magical wards that sealed Voolad inside Thruldar failed, freeing him and his remaining minions. After he was freed, Thruldar became the capital of Voolad's power, where he resided as a Beast Lord and controlled the remainder of the eastern Lluirwood and the lands south of the Toadsquat foothills to the shore of the Gulf of Luiren. There, he maintained an army of undead, strange beasts, evil plant monsters, ogres, and giant insects.",
        "Relationships": "Prior to his death in 1264 DR, Voolad Espiral had the support of a few monster chieftains of Veldorn (an alias of the [[Beastlands]]). He also controlled a small army of [[Dark tree|dark trees]] and other dangerous plant monsters, which were trapped within Thruldar with him. A powerful evil seemed to support Voolad Espiral's machinations and regarded him as a minion during his raid on Thruldar. After the magic failed during the Spellplague and released him, he controlled an army of [[undead]], dangerous plant monsters, strange beasts, giant insects, and [[Ogre|ogres]]."
