He could also convert stolen spells into other spells, belonging to one of Bhaals domains.\nHe was a merchant who mostly plied the route between Scornubel and Waterdeep, but also a highly successful assassin.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, Anwhar Bellgate came into contact with the godsblood shed between Bhaal and Cyric, eventually developing his spellthieving abilities. He continued to ply the route, but became an assassin by 1372 DR."
