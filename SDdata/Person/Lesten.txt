'''Lesten''' was a [[Netherese]] [[archwizard]].

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|3042|NY}}, Lesten engaged in a [[spell]] duel with another archwizard, [[Buoyance]]. Over a century prior, Buoyance had already proven his worth in another spell battle, where he slew [[Kartaklys]]. Lesten's battle with Buoyance, however, was one of epic proportions. Elemental magic was fired this way and that, until there was only one victor: Buoyance. Lesten had crumbled to ash. Following his demise, the other archwizards of [[Netheril]] talked about the grand spell duel until their empire fell.
