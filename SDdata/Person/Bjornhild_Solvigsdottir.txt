Bjornhild Solvigsdottir () was the queen of the Reghedmen Tribe of the Tiger during the late 15 century DR.
Bjornhild was an indomitable warrior and unforgiving ruler.
For some time, Bjornhild was married to the Tribe of the Tigers former ruler, King Korold. When Korold was slain by a frost giant in battle, she ascended as ruler of their tribe.
It was believed by some of her foes that Queen Bjornhild had actual ice water flowing from her heart.
