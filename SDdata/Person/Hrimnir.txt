'''Hrimnir''' was a [[frost giant]] living in the [[Icespire Peak]] in [[1480 DR]].

==History==
When the [[Clan Icehammer|Icehammer]] [[dwarves]] of Icespire Peak discovered the [[Winterforge]] [[artifact]] and the frozen body of [[Lakkar]], Hrimnir dreamed of recreating Lakkar's exploits. Thus he gathered an army of frost creatures and tried to acquire the Winterforge, but in the end was killed by some adventurers.
