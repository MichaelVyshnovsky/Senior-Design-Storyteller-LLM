Hrimnir was a frost giant living in the Icespire Peak in 1480 DR.
When the Icehammer dwarves of Icespire Peak discovered the Winterforge artifact and the frozen body of Lakkar, Hrimnir dreamed of recreating Lakkars exploits. Thus he gathered an army of frost creatures and tried to acquire the Winterforge, but in the end was killed by some adventurers.
