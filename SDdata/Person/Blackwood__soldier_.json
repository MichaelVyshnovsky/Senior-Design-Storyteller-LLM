        "mainbody": "lackwood was a human officer of the Neverwinter Guard in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had long hair and a beard.\nBlackwood owned a darksteel greataxe with a telescoping haft that was forged by Ghelryn Foehammer of Triboar. He cleaned it with boiled linseed oil once a month, but Holga thought this should be once every seven days or so to as it was displaying rusting. \nthumb|left|350px|Blackwood shows Holga and Edgin around the city of Neverwinter to one of its quaint little back-alley on-the-spot executions.\nBlackwood became a loyal henchman of Lord Forge Fitzwilliam and his wizard advisor Sofina when they took power in Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR. After Sofina captured Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore in Castle Never, Forge ordered Blackwood to take them back to the Revels End prison and collect the bounty on them. But Sofina whispered in Blackwoods ear that he should discreetly kill them instead. He and his soldiers led the pair into a shadowy back alley to execute them. But Holga recognized Blackwoods axe and keenly asked about its make, use, and maintenance, even criticized his laxness. All this bought time for Holga to pry loose a paving stone and use it as a weapon as she escaped and defeated the guards. Blackwood recovered and tried to get Holga from behind, but was clobbered by Edgins reinforced lute. Holga caught and kept the axe. \nthumb|right|350px|Walking behind Sofina and Dralas, Blackwood looks out to sea and likely wonders if serving villains is really so good for his health.\nLater, Sofina sent for Dralas and his band of six fellow Thayan assassins. Arriving by boat on the Neverwinter River, Dralas met Sofina, Blackwood, and some of his soldiers at the docks. Sofina ordered Dralas to dispatch Blackwood and his soldiers because they had failed to stop Edgin and Holgas escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly."
