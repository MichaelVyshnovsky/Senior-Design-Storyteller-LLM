'''Tannathra of Hardcastle''' a mage of the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and the first [[Magister]] after the [[Spellplague]].

==Description==
Due to the [[magic item]]s in her body, she was misshapen, and carried herself cowled and cloaked.

==Abilities==
Tannathra had learned to control the powers of the items that had grafted themselves to her body, and found the power to regenerate in the process. She also knew a unique spell granted to her by [[Azuth]] that provided for some form of spell reflection, which affected even area spells. She was an effective combatant who prevailed even against stronger foes.

==Relationships==
She had an abusive father, with whom she cut ties, abandoning her last name after running away.

==Possessions==
She possessed a ''[[belt of power]]'', a ''[[crown of stars (item)|crown of stars]]'', and a ''[[blast scepter]]'', all of which were grafted into her body by a surge of [[wild magic]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1442}}, Azuth offered the office of Magister to a mage in [[Elbulder]], in the inn where Tannathra was staying, [[Harrion's Hall]]. Five other mages, taking offense, attacked him. In the ensuing spellbattle, Tannathra slew them all whilst protecting the inn. Thereafter, she faced few challengers as a Magister.

In the {{yearlinkName|1490}}, she met with [[Mystra]], and requested to be relieved of the office. Mystra granted that, allowing her to remain as a servitor.

==Activities==
After leaving the office, Tannathra had become a servitor of Mystra, who acted alone. She steered clear of politics in that role.
