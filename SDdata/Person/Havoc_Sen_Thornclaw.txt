Havoc Sen Thornclaw was an ax-wielding musician member of the Heart of Bane and part of the Bards Guild of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
By Uktar of the , Havoc found his calling as a member of a band that performed in Ravens Bluff. Curiously enough, the musicians instrument of choice was the ax of deafening and destruction. Sen Thornclaw found like-minded performers among Everett Taber who played drums of panic, Firmal with his illithid bagpipes, Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisnerâ€Ž and his Illmataran organ of pain, all gathered under the leadership of the Kossuthan priest and the bands lead wailer named Nassar. As a group, they picked a name that would prove highly problematic. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous relic of the same name. In Uktar, the Bards Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the citys morale.
Unsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of tanarri led by a marilith, as the planar beings were attracted to the relics dark magic, plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter took the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bards Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a Golden Rooster Patrol led by Sir Kirth Sonath-Pann. In the fallout of the performance, Havoc and the Heart of Bane band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Firmals group as the Bards Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a nabassu.
