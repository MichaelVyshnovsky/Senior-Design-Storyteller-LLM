'''Havoc Sen Thornclaw''' was an [[ax]]-wielding musician member of the [[Heart of Bane (band)|Heart of Bane]] and part of the [[Bard's Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By [[Uktar]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} Havoc found his calling as a member of a band that performed in Ravens Bluff. Curiously enough, the musician's instrument of choice was the ''[[ax of deafening and destruction]]''. Sen Thornclaw found like-minded performers among [[Everett Taber]] who played ''[[drums of panic]]'', [[Firmal]] with his [[illithid bagpipes]], [[Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisnerâ€Ž]] and his ''[[Illmataran organ of pain]]'', all gathered under the leadership of the [[Kossuth]]an [[priest]] and the band's lead wailer named [[Nassar]]. As a group, they picked a name that would prove highly problematic. The Heart of Bane band was named after the infamous [[Heart of Bane|relic]] of the same name. In Uktar, the Bard's Guild plastered the city with posters that advertised that the Heart of Bane would be making an appearance at a performance aimed at helping the city's morale.

Unsurprisingly, the ill-conceived advertisement attracted the attention of a band of [[tanar'ri]] led by a [[marilith]], as the planar beings were attracted to the relic's dark [[magic]], plaguing the city at the time. The ensuing slaughter took the lives of a dozen innocents, and the Bard's Guild was lit aflame, with the guild being severely damaged. The demonic attack was ended by a [[Golden Rooster Patrol]] led by Sir [[Kirth Sonath-Pann]]. In the fallout of the performance, Havoc and the Heart of Bane band went into hiding, leaving only a spokesperson to proclaim their innocence. The proceedings from the show were never paid to Firmal's group as the Bard's Guild claimed that the box office was ransacked by a [[nabassu]].
