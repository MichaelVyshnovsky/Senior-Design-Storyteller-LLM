        "Activities": "Cela's time in the desert gave her a keen eye for selecting quality camels. With her well-developed ability to haggle, and a selection of fine stock, Cela usually came out on top of any deal she bartered.\n\nHer favorite tactic was to pretend to be a lowly [[desert rider]] who was forced to sell her only mount in order to survive, attracting customers eager to take advantage of a wild [[Al-Badia|al-badia]] from the desert.",
        "History": "Cela spent her youth living in the desert as a member of the [[House of Bakr]]. She visited Huzuz on her first pilgrimage and decided to stay."
