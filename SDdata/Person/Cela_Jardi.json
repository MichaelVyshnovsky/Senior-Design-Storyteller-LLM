        "mainbody": "Cela Jardi was a prominent camel-dealer within the Caravan District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nCelas time in the desert gave her a keen eye for selecting quality camels. With her well-developed ability to haggle, and a selection of fine stock, Cela usually came out on top of any deal she bartered.\nHer favorite tactic was to pretend to be a lowly desert rider who was forced to sell her only mount in order to survive, attracting customers eager to take advantage of a wild al-badia from the desert.\nCela spent her youth living in the desert as a member of the House of Bakr. She visited Huzuz on her first pilgrimage and decided to stay."
