        "mainbody": "Ormis Dohor was a powerful monk and head of the Black Raven Monastery.\nOrmis was a half-drow monk, who led many other monks in the teaching of Valas Belaem del Pharm. Despite his ancestry, he abhorred slavery and such wicked acts.  \nOrmis Dohor was the archimandrite of the Black Raven Monastery. In 1310 DR, he left the monastery to make contact with the Legion of the Chimera. He left Aruma Blane in charge whilst he was absent.\nAt the Severed Hand, Ormis saw first hand the atrocities committed by Isair and Madae, such as slavery. He voiced his protest to them, but it only angered the cambion twins. They assumed that, because he was half-drow, he would be sympathetic to the legion, which strongly believed in justice and equality for half-breeds.\nOrmis informed the leaders of the legion that the Black Raven Monastery would never ally with a group that practices slavery. He and his accompanying monks were thrown into a prison on the fourth floor of the Severed Hand. Here, he was transformed into a lemure.\nA cruel Xvimian cleric, the Tyrannar Brutai Mar, held the antidote to transform Ormis back into his normal form. The cleric used to tease Ormis with the antidote, and would demand that he joined forces with Isair and Madae. Every time Ormis refused, he would pour some of the only antidote onto the floor."
