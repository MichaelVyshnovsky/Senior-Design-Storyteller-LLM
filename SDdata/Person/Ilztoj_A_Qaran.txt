'''Ilztoj A'Qaran''' was a [[drow]] mage in [[Cormanthor]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|17}}

==History==
Ilztoj lived in [[Szith Morcane]] until it fell to [[fiendish]] [[fire giant]]s ''circa'' [[1486 DR]]. He, along with seven companions, followed [[Drava T'syrr]] to Cormanthor. There, however, Drava fell under the madness of the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] and started to dance and drink.

Some adventurers (members of the [[Harpers]] hired by [[Elanil Elassidil]] to bring peace to her ancestor [[Meira Faerenduil]]) tried to convince Drava and her companions to go to a refugee camp, but she never complied and in the end she was defeated. Ilztoj became the new leader and agreed to the adventurers' proposal.{{Cite adventurers league/Herald of the Moon|18-19}}

==Personality==
Ilztoj managed to resist the madness. However, he also started to like living in the forest. He continued to honor the drow social rules and followed Drava, who as a female was in a higher position than him.

==Relationship==
Ilztoj was always at Drava's side as her second-in-command.
