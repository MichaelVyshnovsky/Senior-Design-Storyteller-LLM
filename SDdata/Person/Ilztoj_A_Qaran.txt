Ilztoj AQaran was a drow mage in Cormanthor in the late 15 century DR.
Ilztoj lived in Szith Morcane until it fell to fiendish fire giants circa 1486 DR. He, along with seven companions, followed Drava Tsyrr to Cormanthor. There, however, Drava fell under the madness of the demon lord Grazzt and started to dance and drink.
Some adventurers (members of the Harpers hired by Elanil Elassidil to bring peace to her ancestor Meira Faerenduil) tried to convince Drava and her companions to go to a refugee camp, but she never complied and in the end she was defeated. Ilztoj became the new leader and agreed to the adventurers proposal.
Ilztoj managed to resist the madness. However, he also started to like living in the forest. He continued to honor the drow social rules and followed Drava, who as a female was in a higher position than him.
Ilztoj was always at Dravas side as her second-in-command.
