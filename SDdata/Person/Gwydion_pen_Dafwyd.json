        "Personality": "Gwydion was a very indecisive individual, pondering months before coming to an easily swayed conclusion.",
        "Possessions": "Gwydion possessed a ''[[cloak of protection]] +3'', a ''[[crystal ball]]'', a ''[[quarterstaff]] +3'', and a ''[[wand of fireballs]]''.",
        "History": "Once Gwydion was the court wizard of duke [[Pryden Daggerford]] but at [[1370 DR]] the court magician was [[Bronwyn Daggerford]] in all but name. Gwydion was then free to focus on his studies, his ultumate goal being finding a means to achieve immortality, or at least prolonged life. Long ago, he acquired a mysterious book that was reported to detail how achieve [[Lichdom]] but it is said that he found the methods outlined there distasteful. Instead, he frequently has sent adventuring parties in search of a good ''[[potion of longevity]]'' but with no success as of yet."
