'''Lassalar Ormitar''' was a male [[human]] [[fighter]] in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] around [[1358 DR]].

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], he was head of the [[Ormitar]] noble house, a member of the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras, and commanded the [[Guard (Tantras)|Guard]], the military force that defended and policed the city. Although the Guard was directly responsible to the Council, its loyalties lay with Lassalar, who was more serious about restricting merchant freedoms in favour of law and order.
