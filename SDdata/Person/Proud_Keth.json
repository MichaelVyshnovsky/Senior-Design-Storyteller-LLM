        "mainbody": "'''Proud Keth''' was a fierce and deadly [[warrior]] whose life ended in battle many years before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Proud Keth was remembered as the first owner of a unique [[enchanted]] [[Myrkulyte]] [[belt]] – the ''[[Belt of Bones]]''. He wore the belt into countless battles in which Keth was a force of nature, killing anything and anyone who stood in his way. In rare moments when Proud Keth surrounded, he tapped into the belt's magic, surrounding himself with a ''[[circle of bones]]'' that rent and shredded the enemies around. Keth was killed in a battle in which his enemies used the warrior's strategy against him. They used [[polearm]]s and [[spear]]s to end Proud Keth from a safe distance. After the warrior's death, he was interred wearing the '' Belt of Bones'', but his grave was soon desecrated and looted, the belt – stolen."
