Youmans was an ex-adventurer living in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Youmans had a tragic story she was once part of an adventuring party who fought some rust monsters and a tribe of orc/gnoll hybrids, and all save Youmans and one other died. Later, the other adventurer died from an infection and Youmans went back to Daggerford totally devastated in her mind and missing half her leg.
She was often drunk and Baergon Bluesword believed she was haunted by the memories. When Youmans was sober, she carted water for the Watermens Guild.
She lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located on Water Street near the River Gate.
