He sought out individual worshipers of Auril, trying to coerce them into being devout members of his flock. His ultimate goal was to one conquer one or more of the sub-regions in the Cold Lands in the name of his faith&mdashstarting with Vaasa and Damara and then moving on to Impiltur and Narfell&mdashso that senior members of Aurils clergy could rule over them.\nBeyond building up a loyal group of cultists, Vlorund sought to corrupt key military commanders within the armies of Vaasa and Damara, swaying them to his cause. He planned to destroy any commander who dared to refuse to join him in his mission."
