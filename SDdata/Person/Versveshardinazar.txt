'''Versveshardinazar''', also known as '''The Opaline Terror''', was the [[dragon]] ruler of the [[Dead Stone Mountains]] of [[Shyr]], [[Abeir]], in the centuries before the [[Spellplague]].

==History==
Versveshardinazar was the owner of [[Haizverad]], before the [[dragonborn]] earned his freedom. Versveshardinazar was interested in magic items, and used the remains of the [[primordial]] [[Petron]] to procure some for himself.
