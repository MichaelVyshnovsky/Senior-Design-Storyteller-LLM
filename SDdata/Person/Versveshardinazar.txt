Versveshardinazar, also known as The Opaline Terror, was the dragon ruler of the Dead Stone Mountains of Shyr, Abeir, in the centuries before the Spellplague.
Versveshardinazar was the owner of Haizverad, before the dragonborn earned his freedom. Versveshardinazar was interested in magic items, and used the remains of the primordial Petron to procure some for himself.
