'''Elwyn''' was a [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Grove]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Emerald Grove was harried by [[goblin]] raiders loyal to the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Elwyn was terrified about the harm they could inflict upon her fellow druids.

Elwyn was among the druids that began performing the ''[[Rite of Thorns]]'', a ritual that would hide the grove from the surrounding landscape initiated by the leader druid [[Kagha]].
