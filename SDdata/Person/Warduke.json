        "mainbody": "Warduke was a mercenary from the world of Oerth that once served as a member of the Horned Society, and later the League of Malevolence, a band of evil adventurers that traveled together in search of greater power.\nWhile the Oerthian warriors visage was never seen by others, he spoke with a notably raspy and sinister voice. He had beady red eyes, which were in truth fiendish grafts. The visage beneath the helm was that of a grim, hideously scarred gladiator. \nWarduke took particular pleasure in hunting down his foes and reveled in the savagery with which he carried out executions. He had a particularly dark and macabre sense of humor. He liked to be surrounded by his enemies so he could fight a simple massacre. He was however not especially intelligent, and relied on others when strategy or tactics were required to complete a job.\nHe focused rather on his acquisition of material wealth, readily hiring himself out to anyone that could afford his services. Warduke wholly ruthless and held no mercy for himself or those he was paid to kill. In combat, he liked to hit things with his sword it was as simple as that.\nWarduke was a brutal combatant and relentless swordsman. He could draw upon reserves of inner strength, bolstering his vitality in battle. He always fought to the death and if ever caught in the position, would never succumb to surrender. However, he would use a retreat method to break the combat off, if the enemy was an obviously superior foe, or the type that stayed out of melee range.\nHe used wish spells to inherently improve his physical attributes (strength, constitution, and charisma) as payment for particularly important missions.\nDuring his time with the Horned Society, he possessed a +3 bane vs humans anarchic flaming bastard sword made of human bone, called Nightwind. Another weapon in his hands was a +3 dagger of venom. Warduke was protected by a ceremonial spiked adamantine +3 half plate and a +5 heavy steel shield. He wore an amulet of health, gauntlets of giant strength, a pair of boots of speed, and ring of protection.\nIn Feywild, he wore a suit of half plate mail and his characteristic dread helm, which hid his true appearance from friends and foes alike. Warduke fought wielding a flame tongue longsword that he could ignite at will to provide illumination whenever in the dark. \nWhen on the battlefield, Warduke gave no concern for decorum or decency. After identifying his prey, he would track down and eliminate them at an opportune moment, often at times of weakness or vulnerability.\nWarduke viewed the League of Malevolence as a means to an end, merely an accord that would be tolerated so long as it was convenient for his needs. He did regularly work with the groups leader Kelek on numerous occasions,\nWarduke first emerged as a figure of menace during the Greyhawk Wars on the world of Oerth.\nSome unknown time later, he joined on with the sorcerer Kelek and his League of Malevolence, accompanying them on a journey to the Palace of Hearts Desire in the Feywild. It was within the palace that the League into a great battle with the rival group of adventurers known as Valors Call."
