        "mainbody": "Makalia Siannodel was an elven mage who was interred in a crypt beneath the city of Neverwinter.\nMakalia was interred within a sarcophagus decorated with gold paint, and carved with a relief of herself and Chanelle Hallwinter walking through a forest together. Her tomb was filled with old books, scrolls, and material components, as well as a component pouch, five incenses sticks, and a magical scroll of protection from evil and good. Most precious of all was a small gold locket that contained a portrait of her love, Chanelle.\nIn life she was the loving partner of Chanelle Hallwinter, a human knight. After their deaths, they were buried in twin crypts beneath Neverwinter with relief carvings on their sarcophagi depicting their lives together.\nMakalia passed on to the afterlife while Chanelle lingered as a ghost with no memory, but their tombs contained enough clues to remind Chanelle of her lost identity and bring her some peace."
