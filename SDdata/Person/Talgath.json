        "mainbody": "'''Talgath''', also known as the '''Watcher of Castle Never''', '''Talgath the Watcher''', and later '''Talgath the Undying''', was a [[beholder]] who occupied [[Castle Never]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Talgath expected that any living thing that it met would submit to its domination, and it believed that eventually all such beings would inevitably do so. It generally considered most [[humanoid]]s beneath its notice, even intruders within its domain.",
        "History": "Sometime after the [[Ruining]], Talgath arrived in Castle Never to claim the abandoned ruin for its own. It managed to beat back the [[undead]] forces of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], and aimed to conquer the castle from the top-down, thus starting by subjugating the [[ettercap]]s who dwelt in the towers. The ettercap leader, [[Ryxfith]], prophesied that someone from outside the castle would arrive to defeat the beholder for them.\n\nValindra's minions proved unable to defeat Talgath despite her declaring that it was a major priority, however it would ultimately be slain by [[adventurer]]s from Neverwinter in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. This was not the end for Talgath, however, as years later it would be reanimated to serve [[Orcus]] in [[death tyrant|undeath]], and thus become known as Talgath \"the Undying\" as it once more inhabited the ruined castle."
