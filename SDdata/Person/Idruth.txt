'''Idruth''' was a [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] acolyte and the head cook of [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Idruth led a team of cooks who fed the inhabitants of Moonshadow Hall. She and her cooks were also responsible for preparing the feast for the [[New Moon Beneficence]], the temple's monthly charity banquet. The kitchen and the cooks fell under the ultimate responsibility of the senior priestess [[Velsinore]], who handled all internal administration of the temple.

==History==
As of [[1373 DR]], Idruth served under High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]]. From [[Eleasis]] of that year, she served under Moonmistress-Designate [[Feena Archwood]] during the tumultuous events of that period, Her dedication to the feeding of her charges was only thwarted when [[Sharran]]s cultists publicly attacked the Beneficence feast she was assembling.
