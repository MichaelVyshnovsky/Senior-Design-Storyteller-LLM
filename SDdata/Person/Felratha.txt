==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Felratha met the [[drow]] [[Arrizz]], who was on the surface to search for goods for the refugees from [[Szith Morcane]]. Felratha agreed to help him, thanks to her contacts. Together, they gained a shipment of supplies from the [[Zhentarim]] and planned to deliver them using the [[Waydown]]. For this, they hired an adventuring party to escort them.

The plan was to use the minstrel band as cover in order to pass the [[Red Plumes]]' garrison inside the Waydown without suspicion. She was also working with the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] to expose Commander [[Maggarl Helck]]'s illicit activities.{{Cite adventurers league/The Waydown|7-8}}
