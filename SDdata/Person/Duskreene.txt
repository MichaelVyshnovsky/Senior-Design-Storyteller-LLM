Lady Duskreene was a Netherese inhabitant of Tethgard, and later, a watchghost.
She was a wraithlike apparition, with white, snaking hair. Her form was skeletal below the breasts and indeed legless, resembling a living woman above that line.
Lady Duskreene was lonely, and friendly.
She was somehow capable of slaying people as a watchghost.
In life, Lady Duskreene ruled a small area around Tethgard. In death, she often watched the area around her old holdings.
During her tenure as a watchghost shed made an acquaintance of a far-removed descendant of hers, Mirt, who often came tell her of the goings-on in the world. Shed also made an acquaintance of a younger Elminster.
Prior to the founding of Cormyr, Lady Duskreene, a Netherese, had ruled the lands of Tethgard in the Hullack Forest. She was interred in her family crypt and then rose as a watchghost during her tenure as an undead over the ruin, shed made the acquaintance of a younger Elminster, and much later on, of Mirt, who was a remote descendant of her line.
In the late , Mirt guided Delg, Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith to Tethgard as a safety measure, as they were pursued by Zhentilar. While there, Mirt was forced to call out to Duskreene to get her aid in destroying the Zhentilar. She later made an acquaintance of his guests.
