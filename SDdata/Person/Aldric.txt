'''Aldric''' was the abbot of the [[Abbey of St. Sollars]] of the [[Barony of Bloodstone]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Aldric was the spiritual leader of the Barony.

==History==
In 1357 DR, Aldric opposed the idea of hiring [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party.

Some time after the adventurers defeated the bandit army minions of [[Orcus]] infected Aldric with [[vampirism]], driving him mad.
He so said to all that he was sick and never exit more in daytime. At same time he summoned [[rat]]s and [[worg]]s that spread chaos near the abbey. At last he tried to escape from the village in [[gaseous form]].
   
==Personality==
Aldric was very fatalistic, disapproving of going against destiny. He was a powerful opponent.
