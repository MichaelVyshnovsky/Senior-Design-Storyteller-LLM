'''Felgolos''' was a very imprudent [[bronze dragon]],{{Cite dragon/238/Wyrms of the North: Felgolos}} that traveled across [[Faer没n]] causing trouble and surviving perils, much to the befuddlement of many [[dragon]]ologists. Regardless, he sought joy and fun in all of his undertakings.

==Description==
Felgolos' scales had a particularly glossy sheen.

==Personality==
Felgolos was always amiable and curious to a fault. He enjoyed wandering across the Realms, especially into the territories of other dragons, regardless of the inherent danger.

He was very knowledgeable about matters of everyday life in [[Faer没n]]. In contrast, he also possessed a mastery of [[magic]] that far exceeded his years on [[Toril]]. He knew the value of experimentation and observation with regard to [[the Art]].

Felgolos had little want or care for maintaining a treasure hoard as was common with so many other dragons.

He never lied to others, and only hid information if he believed it was for the better.

==Abilities==
Due to the unique [[magic]]al [[enchantment]]s placed upon him by his former mentor, Felgolos was immune to magical effects from the schools of [[alteration]], [[enchantment]] and [[necromancy]].

==Activities==
Felgolos wandered throughout [[the North]], getting involved with a myriad of conflicts and dire situations, from which he always emerged unscathed. He spent much of his time visiting with the many friends he had made, among them [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Malchor Harpell]].

He periodically took on missions to scout out dangerous locales or "purposefully crash-through" the strongholds of the [[Zhentarim]] and steal their wagons.

With such an intense interest in magic, Felgolos has developed a number of spells throughout his life, including ''[[snatchport]]'' and ''[[frame teleport]]''.

==History==
Felgolos was born from a pair of [[bronze dragon]] [[planewalker]]s who were masters of [[arcane magic]].

After his parents left Toril to wander the [[Planes]] they left Felgolos to the care of the archmage [[Thongameir Halargoth|Thongameir "Stormspells" Halargoth]] of [[Halruaa]].
Thongameir was a kindly old collector of rare plants and mosses and together the wizard and the dragon lived many adventures in [[South Faer没n]] searching plants. At one point Thongamair magically altered Felgolos in order to ensure his safety throughout his adventures.

Sometime after the [[Ordning (social structure)|Ordning]] was destroyed in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Felgolos paid a visit to [[cloud giant]] [[Sansuri|Countess Sansuri]] at her flying castle of [[Lyn Armaal]]. After inviting him under false pretenses, Sansuri imprisoned Felgolos in order to extract information about the ancient [[Ostoria]]n markers. While Felgolos knew nothing about what Sansuri searched, he was held in Lyn Armaal's dungeon and tortured.

==Relationships==
Felgolos had good dealings with Elminster, the Seven Sisters, Malchor Harpell and the monks of [[Candlekeep]].
 
==Rumors and Legends==
Some [[sage]]s of Faer没n, with the notable exception of [[Velsaert]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], believed that Felgolos was an avatar of some dormant god or a spawn of the wind-goddess [[Akadi]].
