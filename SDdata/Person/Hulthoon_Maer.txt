Hulthoon Maer was an inhabitant of the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the 14 century DR.
Circa 1341 DR, Hulthoon Maer joined the effort to drive the local cobbler, wizard, and former Elder of the Council Ssuntyr out of the village for his crimes. But the fight turned bloody, and Hulthoon almost lopped off one of Ssuntyrs hands with his axe.
