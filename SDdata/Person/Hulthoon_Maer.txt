'''Hulthoon Maer''' was an inhabitant of the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1341 DR]], Hulthoon Maer joined the effort to drive the local cobbler, [[wizard]], and former Elder of the Council [[Ssuntyr]] out of the village for his crimes. But the fight turned bloody, and Hulthoon almost lopped off one of Ssuntyr's hands with his [[axe]].
