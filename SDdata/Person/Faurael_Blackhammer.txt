Faurael Blackhammer was a human fighter and the Lord Protector of the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. 
By the mid-1360s DR, this old soldier had gray hair and a number of old wounds caused him constant pain. Regardless, he was still strong and intelligent.
The pain of his wounds made Faurael bad-tempered, yet he remained a sharp strategist and fine instructor. He desired death in battle with the knowledge of victory, though of course he wouldnt seek a battle on the borders of the town he loved if he could help it.
As Lord Protector, his duties were to command the towns militia to settle disputes and to make, amend, or remove the Lords Decrees at will. Despite his great age and injuries, he still continued to train the towns militia without rest. Under Lord Protector Fauraels leadership and training, the small Triboar militia was the equal of many a standing army.
Blackhammer worked hard over the years to influence the Lords Alliance and all the mages and clerics he could find to stop the threat of the orc hordes of the North forever, perhaps by using magic on them or breaking the power of their mountain communities. He hoped this would help the North grow powerful and populous and of course protect Triboar once and for all.
By 1357 DR, Faurael had held the role of lord protector for thirty years, having won the elections held every seven years. By 1368 DR, he had reigned for forty years.
Finally, in the , Faurael got this wish. When the annis Tanta Hagara led a force of fiends from Hellgate Keep and allied Blue Bear tribesmen in an attack on the Citadel of the Mists, Faurael led a force to aid in its defense while the Mistmaster used the Gatekeepers Crystal to obliterate Hellgate Keep. Faurael and his warriors died fighting the tanarri hordes, and took no less than six of them down with them.
