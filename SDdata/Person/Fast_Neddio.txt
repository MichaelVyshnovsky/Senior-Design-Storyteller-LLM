'''Fast Neddio''' was a lustful inhabitant of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Nothing wrong with looking, is there? A man can dream...''|Fast Neddio}}

==Description==
Neddio had sun-kissed skin, brown eyes, and a clean-shaven face and head. His clothes betrayed him as a man of means and his hat – as a man of poor taste.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Fast Neddio could often be found in the Lower City, not far from the [[Blushing Mermaid]] with the [[hin]] fiend named [[Theda Grosz]]. Together, they spent their days productively – drooling and lusting over passing [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary patrols. Neddio, by his own admission, could not resist a man in uniform or any other man in general.
