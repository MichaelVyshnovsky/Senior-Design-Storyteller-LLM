Emi Towiki was a maiden butterfly in Ito-jo in 1360 DR.
Towiki was a kitchen worker at the Ito familys castle. She fell in love with Ajimo Heikaru, the first son of the familys warlord. However, distracted by his love, Heikaru was negligent in rallying the clans army when needed in 647 DR. So a curse transformed him into a wererat condemned to guard his lovers room for eternity, while she was turned into a butterfly.
At last, in 1360 DR, an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to recover the Seven Swords fought and destroyed Heikaru. Afterward, Towiki met them, telling them information about the swords and later disappeared.
