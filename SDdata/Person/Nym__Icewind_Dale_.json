        "mainbody": "ym was an unscrupulous drow trader who worked in Icewind Dale in the late 13 and early 14 centuries DR.\nNym indirectly caused the fall of both the fortress of the Severed Hand and Dorns Deep by stealing the elven and dwarven magical items from Dorns Deep and then selling them to the goblinoid armies that proceeded to sack them both.\nThe elves of the Severed Hand blamed the dwarves of Dorns Deep for the fact that the goblinoids had the items, since they were all from Dorns Deeps treasury and haughtily ignored the dwarves pleas of innocence. Divided, the two realms both fell to their respective goblinoid assaults and caused long-lasting bitterness between the elves and dwarves of the Spine of the World and Frozenfar. That such an act could cause such far-reaching devastation speaks of the drows utter lack of moral fiber.\nSeveral powerful paladins heard of Nyms evil actions and vowed to put an end to it, hounding him through the Underdark and Frozenfar where he did most of his business, but Nym always managed to find a way to elude or defeat them.\nNym was not above haggling, though usually only when faced with the prospect of being attacked by powerful and wealthy adventurers who would not only cost him business, but also possibly his life. However, to avoid these kinds of situations, Nym carried a collection of magical items to rival that of a certain other drow.\nNym was capable as a warrior, dabbled in enchantment, and was as charming as they come, managing to allay the suspicions of a camp full of escaped svirfneblin slaves who had a terrible fear of the drow pursuing them, but above all, he was a trader. His only goal in life was to accumulate wealth and he was highly proficient at doing just that."
