        "mainbody": "Connel Greylore was a skilled archer that served as a sentry and leader of the armed forces of Shadowdale during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nWhen the Zhentilar army marched upon Shadowdale in the , Connel led the sentries that took roost in the trees beyond Krag Pool. In the opening exchanges of the battle that would follow, Connel and his arches rained volleys of arrows upon the first Zhent soldiers that stepped foot within their range, maneuvering others into wooden stake traps they had erected.\nThis success was quick-lived however, as Connel was taken down by a volley of arrows launched by Zhent archers in response."
