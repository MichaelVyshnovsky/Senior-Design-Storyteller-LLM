Karsellyn Lylyl-Lytherraias was a drow cleric of Eilistraee in Evermeet in 1367 DR.
Karsellyn had worked for years as an agent of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower among drow. In 1367 DR, she settled in Evermeet to discuss how drow could participate in the Retreat. Her presence on the isle was known only to the queen and the high mage Laeroth Runemaster. The queen knew that sun elf Houses would never accept drow on Evermeet.
Karsellyn was a graceful individual and the perfect representative of how a good-oriented drow could be. She was impulsive, chaotic, intense, flirtatious, and somewhat fickle.
Some said that Karsellyn was romantically interested in the human buccaneer Carreigh Macumail.
