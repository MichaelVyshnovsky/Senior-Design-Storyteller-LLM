        "mainbody": "rkanis was a dwarven fighter who stayed in Candlekeep for a time during the 14 century DR.\nIn the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Arkanis and a handful of others were gathered together by the Gatewarden of Candlekeeps to assist Gorions Ward with a few of the finer points of group dynamics in combat. Together, the group found waves of illusory beasts and monsters that were summoned by the mage Obe.\nSome time later, as Candlekeep was being infiltrated by doppelgangers, Arkanis and the halfling thief Deder escaped into the library-fortress subterranean catacombs. Within, they encountered Gorions Ward yet again."
