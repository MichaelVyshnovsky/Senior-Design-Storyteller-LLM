        "History": "In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Arkanis and a handful of others were gathered together by the [[Gatewarden]] of Candlekeep's to assist [[Gorion's Ward]] with a few of the finer points of group dynamics in combat. Together, the group found waves of [[illusory]] beasts and monsters that were summoned by the [[mage]] [[Obe]].\n\nSome time later, as Candlekeep was being infiltrated by [[doppelganger]]s, Arkanis and the [[halfling]] [[thief]] [[Deder]] escaped into the library-fortress' subterranean catacombs. Within, they encountered Gorion's Ward yet again."
