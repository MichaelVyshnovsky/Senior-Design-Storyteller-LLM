Usually her role was to cast ''[[silence]]'' to the area of action, but often she could not resist entering the fight. Hydee was infatuated with Master [[Colstan Rhuul]], whom she had met a few times, but she was not as beautiful as his usual companions of Colstan. On one occasion, Hydee killed a female wizard whom Colstan chose instead of her.",
