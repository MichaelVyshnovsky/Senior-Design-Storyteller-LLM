        "mainbody": "Hydee was a member of the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Skullport around 1370 DR.\nHydee was a cleric of Loviatar and acted in a supportive role to a Hands team. Usually her role was to cast silence to the area of action, but often she could not resist entering the fight. Hydee was infatuated with Master Colstan Rhuul, whom she had met a few times, but she was not as beautiful as his usual companions of Colstan. On one occasion, Hydee killed a female wizard whom Colstan chose instead of her.\nCategoryClerics of Loviatar\nCategoryClerics\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryWorshipers of Loviatar\nCategorySlavers\nCategoryMembers of the Xanathars Thieves Guild\nCategoryInhabitants of Skullport\nCategoryInhabitants of Waterdeep\nCategoryInhabitants of Undermountain\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\njbvzht5l6a58h9jlnmajxeakoc6gevc"
