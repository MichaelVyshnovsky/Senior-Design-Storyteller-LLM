Dhaerhaera Nanatar was a female human wizard and adventuress who made her home in Tantras in the Vast around 1358 DR. She was one of the more notable mages of the city at the time.
In the late 1350s DR, Dhaerhaera captured a griffon and successfully tamed it and taught it to carry her as a rider. Riding her griffon, she regularly flew around the Vast looking for adventure. After the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, her project was exploring the old mountain tombs and strongholds of elves and humans, dating back to the time when dwarves ruled the Vast. She sought lost magic, and had some success in this.
