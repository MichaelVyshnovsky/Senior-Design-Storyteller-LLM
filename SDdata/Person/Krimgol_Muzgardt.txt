'''Krimgol Muzgardt''' was a [[duergar]] [[ale]] merchant of [[Clan Muzgardt]] from [[Gracklstugh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], during one of his travels to [[Mantol-Derith]], he found [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]'s gem. Convinced by the gem that he was without honor, Krimgol hired the wizard [[Yantha Coaxrock]], leader of the [[Stoneheart Enclave]] in [[Blingdenstone]], to set the gem in an item of jewellery.

However, Yantha too succumbed to the gem's influence and lied to Krimgol about the value of the gem. Suspecting treachery, he demanded the gem back, but it was secretly stolen by [[Flink Thunderbonk]]. Krimgol did not believe Yantha's story and, with the support of [[Ghuldur Flagonfist]], the duergar representative, attacked the deep gnome section of the city and kidnapped the wizard, starting a civil war in the trading post.

Ghuldur and Krimgol then interrogated Yantha in order to understand the whole matter.

==Personality==
The gem caused Krimgol to believe himself to be a [[calassabrak]]â€”a duergar without honor.

==Relationship==
Krimgor was a good friend of Ghuldur Flagonfist, the duergar representative in Mantol-Derith.
