'''Typhoeus''', also simply referred to as the '''hundred-headed dragon''', was a monstrous creature created by the primeval [[goddess]] [[Gaea]] to fight the [[Olympian pantheon]] early in its existence.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|2}}{{Cite polyhedron/13/Gods, Demigods, and DMs|11}}

==Description==
The creature was said to be a [[dragon]] with a hundred heads. Some accounts further described its heads as all being on fire, that a thousand [[poison]]ous [[viper]]s protruded from its back, and that its body was larger than a mountain.

==History==
Following the Olympian pantheon's overthrowing of their predecessors the [[Greater Titans]] and their imprisonment in the [[plane]] of [[Carceri]], their mother goddess Gaea sent monstrous creatures against the Olympians in order to liberate and avenge the Titans. According to some accounts, the Olympians first fought Typhoeus before having to do battle with the [[gigante]]s, whilst other accounts spoke of Typhoeus being Gaea's final creation sent against them. The creature was ultimately buried beneath a mountain, either by the gods collectively or by [[Zeus]] alone.
