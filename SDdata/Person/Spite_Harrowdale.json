        "mainbody": "'''Spite Harrowdale''' was a thousand-year-old [[archmage]] who posed as a 12-year-old apprentice [[mage]] in the magical academy of [[Dweomercore]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Spite was extremely intelligent; he was fluent in a number of languages and possessed great talent as a practitioner of [[the Art]].\n\nHe appeared as a young [[Rashemi]] boy who demonstrated typical [[magic]]al skill for someone that age. He owed his youthful appearance to regular imbibing of ''[[Potion of longevity|potions of longevity]]''.",
        "Activities": "Spite viewed the \"Mad Mage\" [[Halaster Blackcloak]] as a superior magical power and wanted to learn as much as he could from the similarly ancient wizard. He viewed his time in Undermountain as a grand adventure.\n\nWhile enrolled in Dweomercore, Spite came to realize that the headmaster of the academy was not actually Halaster Blackcloak, but rather an [[arcanaloth]] assuming his form. Spite maintained a similar deception, demonstrating competence in only the most basic spells to maintain his ruse of being a pre-adolescent magic student. Unlike Spite's classmates, the arcanaloth saw through the archmage's deceit as well and kept a close eye on his activities.\n\nWhile he was enrolled within the academy, in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Spite sought to steal Halaster Blackcloak's personal [[spellbook]].",
        "Relationships": "The archmage was accompanied by an [[oni mage]] named [[Kumar]] who, like Spite, altered their appearance to that of a [[half-orc]] woman named \"Dumara\".",
        "Possessions": "Within his personal dormitory, Spite kept the two volumes of his spellbooks, the ''Spells of Spite''. They were hidden within a ''[[Leomund's secret chest]]'', in a room protected by a ''[[glyph of warding]]''.",
        "History": "Before he joined the academy of Dweomercore, during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Spite lived in Undermountain within the realm of [[Wyllowwood]].\n\nHe and Kumar made their home within a set of ruins nestled into an isle in the middle of the [[River of the Depths]]. In addition to his room, he had a small laboratory and holding cells that housed the subjects of his arcane experimentation."
