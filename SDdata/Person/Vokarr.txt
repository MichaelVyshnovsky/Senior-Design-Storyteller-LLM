'''Vokarr the Eyebiter''' was an [[orc]] war chief who died sometime before the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}.

==Abilities==
Exceptional aggression, fury, and the ability to let out rallying battle cries made Vokarr quite dangerous on the battlefield.

==Possessions==
Vokarr wielded a [[greataxe]] and a [[spear]].

==Relationships==
Vokarr was able to command the respect of hunters from the [[Many-Arrows tribe]].

==History==
Slain by [[dwarves]] sometime prior to 1489 DR, Vokarr's [[spirit]] came to be tied to an ''[[orc stone]]'' that made its way to [[Icewind Dale]]. This spirit had to obey the commands of one who was attuned to the ''stone''.
