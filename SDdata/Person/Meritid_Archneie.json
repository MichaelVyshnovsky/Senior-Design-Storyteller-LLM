        "mainbody": "Dread High Trident Meritid Archneie was a human cleric of Umberlee living in the Queenspire within Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Meritid discovered a magic abalone shell floating in Waterdeeps harbor, which he thought was The Orglara, an ancient holy relic of the Bitch Queen. Taking his find as a good omen, Archneie petitioned the Lords of Waterdeep to allow him to construct a temple to Umberlee within the city, funded by half the annual tithe to Umberlees Cache. Unlikely as this request was, the Lords agreed, but did not say why, and construction commenced.\nBy Eleasis of 1372 DR, the Queenspire was close to being finished, and Meritid called for Umberlants to join him there.\nWhile Meritid was a faithful follower of Umberlee, he was also an agent of the Kraken Society, who operated out of the city. He was also known to be a good source of information around 1372 DR."
