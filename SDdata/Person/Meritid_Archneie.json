        "mainbody": "Dread High Trident '''Meritid Archneie''' was a [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Umberlee]] living in the [[Queenspire]] within [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Meritid discovered a magic [[green abalone|abalone]] [[shell]] floating in Waterdeep's harbor, which he thought was ''[[The Orglara]]'', an ancient holy relic of the Bitch Queen. Taking his find as a good omen, Archneie petitioned the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to allow him to construct a temple to Umberlee within the city, funded by half the annual tithe to [[Umberlee's Cache]]. Unlikely as this request was, the Lords agreed, but did not say why, and construction commenced.\n\nBy [[Eleasis]] of [[1372 DR]], the Queenspire was close to being finished, and Meritid called for Umberlants to join him there.",
        "Activities": "While Meritid was a faithful follower of Umberlee, he was also an agent of the [[Kraken Society]], who operated out of the city. He was also known to be a good source of information around 1372 DR."
