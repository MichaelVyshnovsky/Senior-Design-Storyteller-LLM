Ali Abdal Akim was a daolani who lived in the fortress of Sarahin in 1367 DR.
Driven by a wicked and sadistic nature, Ali would harass anyone if he believed he could get away with it. Alis master enjoyed seeing the look of fear in his victims eyes.
Ali served the leader of the Unclean, Akim al-Kalaas.
Ali did as his master commanded.
He knew the secret identity of Farouk Abd al-Bazan, but wisely kept this knowledge to himself, fearful of what the genies would do if his master died and he was sent back to the Elemental planes.
