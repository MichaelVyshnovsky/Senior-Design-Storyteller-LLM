'''Ali Abdal Akim''' was a [[daolani]] who lived in the fortress of [[Sarahin]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|19}}

==Personality==
Driven by a wicked and sadistic nature, Ali would harass anyone if he believed he could get away with it. Ali's master enjoyed seeing the look of fear in his victim's eyes.

==Relationships==
Ali served the leader of the [[Unclean (Zakhara)|Unclean]], [[Akim al-Kalaas]].

==Activities==
Ali did as his master commanded.

He knew the secret identity of [[Farouk Abd al-Bazan]], but wisely kept this knowledge to himself, fearful of what the [[genie]]s would do if his master died and he was sent back to the [[Elemental planes]].
