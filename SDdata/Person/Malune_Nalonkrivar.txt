Malune Nalonkrivar was the Magister from  to .
He was tall and handsome, with a beard, icy blue eyes, and sharp features.
Malune was described as a master of intrigues, and a smooth-tongued man.
As the Magister, Malune employed little beyond his own spellbook and a ring of flying. The remainder of his wealth was cached throughout Faer√ªn, with his possessions previous to becoming the Magister in particular being in a ruined castle.
Before his tenure, Malune had been an ambassador to Thay, Tharsult, Mulhorand, and Tethyr however, he was not seen as adequate, because of his reluctance to bluster and threaten. On the day he was offered the position of the Magister, Malune was the target of an assassination attempt Azuth carried the two of them away from the assassins, up over the night sky of Calimport, through a ceiling that turned to gas temporarily. Malune, viewing his previous life as forfeit, accepted.
As the Magister, Malune traveled extensively, stopping only to aid mages and experience local delights his acumen with business ensured he never had any trouble with money, while his power was sufficient to casually win duels. He died in the Tunland, after the winter snows of  swelled the swamps on stopping to rest, he accidentally wandered into a black dragons ambush. The dragon, Constulgrael, decapitated him with a single bite before he could do anything.
It is said many of the mages Malune stopped to aid were young, comely women Malune judged this was so, and viewed it as a sign of Mystras favor, for she brought such delights close by.
