        "mainbody": "Sir Dutiocs was the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, stationed in the Skull Crag Keep in the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr in the 14 century DR.\nSir Dutiocs was an honorable and experienced iron-clad human knight. He was 57 years old in the early 1360s DR.\nAs a knight of the keep, he wielded a +3 enchanted long sword in battle. He wore an enchanted +3 elfin chain, and a cloak of displacement. Among other items in his possession were darts of the hornets nest, a potion of speed, and a ring of cold resistance.\nBy the early 1360s DR, Sir Dutiocs was already the Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, a Cormyrean order dedicated to patrolling and keeping the High Road safe for merchant caravans that entered and left the Forest Kingdom through the Storm Horns. Dutiocs and his men served under the Roadwarden of the Skull Crag Keep – a renowned hero Arelin Starbrow. In the early 1360s DR, the Roadwarden fell to a monster onslaught leaving Sir Dutiocs galloping away from danger along with her body. As he retreated, he was forced to leave behind the Arms of the Roadwarden, symbols of the office. Sir Dutiocs steed received an arrow to its hind leg as the knight approached the gates of Skull Crag, blaring his signal horn. Luckily, he was greeted by a group of caravan guards who had recently ended their contract in the village.\nThe adventurers and Sir Dutiocs stood against a monster band that chased the knight across the mountain. A fierce battle ensured against a collection of orges, hill giants, minotaurs, and an oni mage. Luckily, the battle was won however, the danger remained. The monster attack was just a harbinger, and a horde soon besieged the mountain road leading towards Skull Crag and collapsed the towns underground passages, cutting it off from any escape routes. The heroes recognized the dead body – it was the local hero Arelin Starbrow. Sir Dutiocs invited his saviors to the Skull Crag Keep, sure that the Roadwarden Guard would soon need help against the horde and aid with the recovery of the Arms of the Roadwarden. He wrote a Writ of Passage for the group and rushed to the keep."
