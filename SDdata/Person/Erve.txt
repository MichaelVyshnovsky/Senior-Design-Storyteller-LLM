Erve was a priest of Jergal in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Erve went to an abandoned temple of Waukeen to take an inventory of the dead buried in the churchs graveyard and crypt. However, some of the builders of the temple were secretly cultists of Grazzt and their leader, by now a shadow demon, possessed Erve. Under demonic possession, Erve re-opened the temple as a sanctuary to Grazzt.
Around 1492 DR Erve joined the army that tried to free Phlan from the Vorgansharax.
Erve had dealings with the Order of the Gauntlet.
