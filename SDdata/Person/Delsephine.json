Klauth was intrigued but also worried about human civilization of the North. So the dragon summoned a cultist group led by Delsephine and ordered them to build an airship to go to the Eye of the All-Father shrine to help an adventuring party he had detected there. Delsephine followed all Klauths orders without questions."
