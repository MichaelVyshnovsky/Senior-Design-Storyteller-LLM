        "History": "In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], the great [[red dragon]] [[Klauth]] had discovered that the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] of the [[giant]]s was broken by [[Annam]]. Klauth was intrigued but also worried about [[human]] civilization of the [[North]]. So the dragon summoned a cultist group led by Delsephine and ordered them to build an [[airship]] to go to the [[Eye of the All-Father]] shrine to help an adventuring party he had detected there. Delsephine followed all Klauth's orders without questions."
