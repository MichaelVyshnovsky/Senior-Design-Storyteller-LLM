'''Gaxly Rudderbust''' was the publisher of the "[[Waterdeep Wazoo]]" in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} Gaxly believed that the returned [[Black Viper]] thief was the secret, evil twin sister of [[Ammalia Cassalanter]], and that she wore a mask to hide a disfigurement. [[Savra Belabranta]], under orders of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], wanted to hire some adventurers to determine the reality of this news.
