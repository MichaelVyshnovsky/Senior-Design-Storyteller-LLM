Gaxly Rudderbust was the publisher of the "Waterdeep Wazoo" in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.
In 1492 DR, Gaxly believed that the returned Black Viper thief was the secret, evil twin sister of Ammalia Cassalanter, and that she wore a mask to hide a disfigurement. Savra Belabranta, under orders of the Order of the Gauntlet, wanted to hire some adventurers to determine the reality of this news.
