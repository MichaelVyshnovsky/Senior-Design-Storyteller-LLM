The Whispering Serpent was the main advisor of the rulers of Sammaresh in Lapaliiya. Believed to be the ghost of a couatl, in truth he was a living couatl using ethereal jaunt. He advised Lady Ilnara Mremman around 1373 DR.
His main duty was to ready the forces of western Lapaliiya to defend against the yuan-ti. Sometimes he hired adventurers to thwart yuan-ti plots, by manifesting before them.
