        "mainbody": "Queen '''Fritha Craegmar''' was the chieftain of the [[Reghedmen]] [[Tribe of the Tiger]] [[barbarian]]s during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Renowned for her wisdom and fairness, Fritha was a formidable [[warrior]], although she held no desire for violence and leaned towards sending diplomatic envoys.",
        "History": "As unexpected storms unleashed their fury in [[Eleasis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1485}} and the Tribe of the Tiger found itself assailed by beasts under the command of the [[Hedrun Arnsfirth|Ice Witch]], Queen Fritha Craegmar guided her people to seek haven in [[Bremen]] and not to fight the \"weak folk\" of the [[Ten Towns]]. She negotiated with [[Dorbulgruf Shalescar]], the speaker of Bremen, but the townspeople, filled with suspicion, denied entry to the tribe. She organized a peaceful departure for the tribe and went to the northwestern shores of [[Maer Dualdon]] to set up a camp.\n\nA significant number of the tribe's members voiced dissatisfaction with her leadership, asserting that she should have let them conquer the town to ensure the tribe's survival."
