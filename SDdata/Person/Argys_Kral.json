        "mainbody": "Argys Kral was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 century DR.\nWhen Argys went to Aunsible Durns smithy, Dovo—a friend of Argys whod worked there and fancied himself a prankster—put a burr under his mares saddle so it threw him when he mounted. Aunsible Durn chewed Dovo out for that. Argys was likely even less impressed."
