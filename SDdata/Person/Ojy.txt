Ojy was the spiritual guide of the village of Golden in the land of Koryo in Kara-Tur long before the 14th century DR.The descriptions of magical shuriken called stars of Ojy-do in Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2 refer to Ojy and the village of Golden. Although the games are primarily set in northwest Faerûn, it is not known where Golden lies. Ojy-do, however, is a city in Koryo, and the Fangs of Night ninja there are known for Throwing Stars of Ojy-do, but these have very different powers. Given the similarity and oriental theme, this article assumes that Golden lies in Koryo near Ojy-do. The relationship between Ojy and Ojy-do is unknown. He was known for forging the magical shuriken called the stars of Ojy-do.
When bandits besieged the village of Golden, the villagers were forced to defend themselves and Ojy was pressed into work as a weaponsmith, though he knew little of metalworking. With every accurate strike of his hammer, he thanked his guiding spirits, and so the stars of Ojy-do were forged from the strength of his faith. They proved just as resilient. . He also crafted other weapons, and with his creations, the villagers fought back.
By 1372 DR, stars of Ojy-do circulated around the northwest Faerûn and the Sword Coast North.
