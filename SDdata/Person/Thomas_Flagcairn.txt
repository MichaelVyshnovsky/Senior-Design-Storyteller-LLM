'''Thomas Flagcairn''' was the Mayor of the city of [[Sapra]] on [[Ilighôn]], off the coast of the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Thomas was a humble blacksmith of Sapra. As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, he was also elected the Mayor of the town. He ruled alongside the six members of the council of elders. Thomas's mayoral position was a part-time vocation, and he continues honing his craft while meeting the council once a month unless a crisis required an emergency gathering.
