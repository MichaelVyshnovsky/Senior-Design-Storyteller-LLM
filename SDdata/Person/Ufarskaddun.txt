Ufarskaddun was the leader of a band of 200 orogs that migrated from the Lowerdark to the Northdark during the 14 century DR.
In 1372 DR, Ufarskaddun led his people upwards from the depths of Toril, searching for a base from which they could strike out at the surface lands of Faer√ªn. During their journey, they came across the ruins of the dwarven city of Splendarrmornn, the royal capital of ancient Ammarindar. They took over the ravaged dwarfhold, ridding the region of the undead and scattered fiends.
Some of their patrols came across tanarukks, demonic orcs, that unbeknownst to the orog chieftain, were part of the much larger Scoured Legion of Hellgate Keep. While he ordered the complete extinction of any remainders of the foul hybrids, he was unaware of the true strength of their stronghold.
