        "mainbody": "Lady Aalangama Gulderhorn was Countess of Morninggold,\nAalangama appeared much older than she actually was, because of her level of stress and hard work.\nAalangama had a driven personality. She was impatient and grew easily frustrated with hypocrisy among the nobles who pretended to be religious.\nAalangama was the second child of Belkerri Gulderhorn, the re-founder of the worship of Siamorphe in Waterdeep. Aalangamas older sister was named Kerri and married into the Assumbar noble family. Aalangamas younger brother was named Vrom Gulderhorn and worked as a priest in her mothers temple in the city.\nAalangama had been married and had a son and a daughter, but she was a widow by 1370 DR.\nAs Countess of Morninggold and commander of the Order of the Silver Chalice, Lady Aalangama saw to the defense of the eastern borders of Tethyr. Countess Gulderhorns decisions on matters of succession could only be overturned by the queen herself or a majority vote of the Royal Privy Council.\nAs Countess of Morninggold, Lady Gulderhorn split her time between living at her official county seat of Morninggold Keep and Mount Noblesse, the headquarters of the Order of the Silver Chalice.\nAalangama was a priestess of Siamorphe living in Waterdeep at the Assumbar Villa. Her family had fled Tethyr in 1347 DR, after the Ten Black Days of Eleint.\nIn 1358 DR, she joined nine young nobles to defend the Sea Ward of Waterdeep from Myrkuls horde. Thanks to Aalangama, they declared themselves a knightly order in 1359 DR.\nAalangama and the others knights departed for Tethyr shortly after the end of the Time of Troubles, where they worked to restore the nobility of that anarchic country. As a member of the Gulderhorn family of Morninggold, she was rightly a noble herself, but her hereditary lands and titles were sold to Zaranda Star during the time period of the Tethyrian Interregnum in 1362 DR to help fund the Orders operations.\nAt the start of the Reclamation Wars, the Order was divided about whether to support Zaranda Star or not. They eventually joined her side, and bravely participated in the fighting.\nAt the First Siege of Myratma, only three of the founders of the Order, including Aalangama, survived the battle. Queen Zaranda restored Aalangamas lands and titles back to her family as a reward for her bravery and leadership in the battle."
