'''Aryvindaire''' was a trader and a leader of a [[wood elven]] band that resided within the [[Neverwinter Wood]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Aryvindaire and the group of elves were proficient at stealthily moving across the Neverwinter Wood [[tree]]s unnoticed, ready to riddle their enemies with [[arrow]]s at a moment's notice. Aryvindaire was a confident elf who spoke with a melodic voice with a noticeable wood-elven accent.

==Possessions==
Aryvindaire's elves all wore ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''. Some of the items sold by Aryvindaire to allies of the group included ''[[elven chainmail]]'', ''[[shederran longbows]]'', a ''[[composite longbow of deadly precision]]'' and ''of precision'',  ''[[amulets of natural armor]]'', ''[[cloaks of elvenkind]]'', ''[[stones of alarm]]'', a ''[[ring of the wood elves]]'', and a selection of [[enchanted]] arrows and [[potion]]s.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Aryvindaire elven band could be found  amidst the trees of Neverwinter Wood on the [[Neverwinter River]]'s eastern bank. They warned strangers that they were not welcomed in that part of the wood; however, if the invaders proved to be allies, elves, or individuals knowledgeable of wood elven culture and language, Aryvindaire offered to trade for the group's valuable elvish goods.
