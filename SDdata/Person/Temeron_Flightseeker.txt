'''Temeron Flightseeker''' was an adventurer around the year [[1369 DR]].

==History==
Temeron was the leader of the adventuring party of the [[Company of the Aerie]]. In 1369 DR, [[Lhaeo]], scribe to [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], hired them to to rescue the missing [[Randal Morn]]. First, they searched inside the tomb of [[Shraevyn]] but found only [[undead]], [[Zhentarim]], and a note from Randal that directed the Company to the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]]. Meanwhile, they managed to recover the ''[[Sword of the Dales]]''. However, in Spiderhant, Temeron found no trails to Randal Morn. At last, a large group of undead attacked them and only Temeron survived.

However, poisoned, Temeron was on the verge of death when he met another adventuring party at the point where the [[Arachnid Pathway]] broke free of Spiderhaunt. He gave to them the sword and the mission and finally died.
