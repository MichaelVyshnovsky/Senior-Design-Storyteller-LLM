'''Galin''' was an [[elf]] that served as warden of [[Altand]] in the [[Misty Forest]] in the [[High Moor]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He unfortunately became entangled in the schemes of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Personality==
He developed something of an anxious personality due to the numerous burdens set upon his shoulders and secrets he was forced to keep.

==Relationships==
Galin became an ally and of Neronvain, a leader within the Cult of the Dragon and the banished son of the elven King [[Melandrach]].

The nervous elf had a pet [[raven]] that accompanied him on his travels beyond the borders of Altand.

==History==
Some time during or before the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} [[Wyrmspeaker]] Neronvain and his [[green dragon]] ally [[Chuth]] assaulted Galin's village of Altand in the Misty Forest. Due to the death of an elven priest, Galin ascended as leader of the village. During the assault, Galin witnessed his wife killed before him and crumbled as a leader. He begged for mercy when confronted by Neronvain.

To protect the surviving elves and prevent further destruction of Altand, Galin swore allegiance to Neronvain and his cause. The dragon cult leader left the village alone, and Galin was forced to live a double life as an asset of the Cult of the Dragon. He offered up information about the surrounding settlements in exchange for Neronvain's "mercy".
