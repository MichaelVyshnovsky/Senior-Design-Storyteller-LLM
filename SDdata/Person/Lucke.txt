'''Lucke''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and a master of [[summoning]].

==Personality==
Lucke was happy to share the knowledge of the summoning [[spell]]s he developed with other arcanists, instead of keeping them secret or demanding an exchange. However, Lucke was disappointed to learn that other arcanists used his spells to pit creatures against each other for purposes of entertainment.

==Activities==
This animal-loving spellcaster was known to always be around creatures that he had summoned, as well as his gray [[cat]].

==History==
Lucke was born in [[Conferia]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1828|NY}}. Four years after this final spell was created, he left his hometown for good in {{YearlinkConvert|2118|NY}}. Lucke was never reported to have come back.

==Rumors & Legends==
Lucke was the subject of many rumors, though most were to do with his feline friend. Some claimed that his gray cat was actually a [[dragon]] who possessed the arcanist, instead of the other way round.
