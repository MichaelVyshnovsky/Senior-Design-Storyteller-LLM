Rahl Zuberi was the lead reptile trainer at Fort Beluarian as of the late 15 century DR.
His body was heavily scarred and decorated with many tattoos. Half of his right was missing, having been apparently been bitten off by some manner of creature.
In contrast to his striking and somewhat fearsome appearance, Rahl had a joyous soul and enjoyed entertaining others. He spent his free time drinking and sharing outlandish tales with others in the camp.
He was considered something of a prankster as well.
Rahl led the efforts caring for and training nearly a dozen dinosaurs, including six hadrosauruses and four deinonychuses, for the Flaming Fist soldiers of Fort Beluarian. The former were used as pack animals while the latter were trained as mounts or hunting animals to take down larger game.
