'''Rahl Zuberi''' was the lead reptile trainer at [[Fort Beluarian]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
His body was heavily scarred and decorated with many [[tattoo]]s. Half of his right was missing, having been apparently been bitten off by some manner of creature.

==Personality==
In contrast to his striking and somewhat fearsome appearance, Rahl had a joyous soul and enjoyed entertaining others. He spent his free time drinking and sharing outlandish tales with others in the camp.

He was considered something of a prankster as well.

==Abilities==
Rahl led the efforts caring for and training nearly a dozen [[dinosaur]]s, including six [[hadrosaurus]]es and four [[deinonychus]]es, for the [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers of Fort Beluarian. The former were used as pack animals while the latter were trained as mounts or hunting animals to take down larger game.
