He became able to enter the protected standing stone circle, overpower Briartan, and take control of the Mucklestones.\n\nGameliel took him captive; the blightlord tortured and mutilated the druid for tendays{{cite book/Lady of Poison|52|6}} until released by [[Ususi Manaallin]], [[Marrec]], [[Gunggari Ulmarra]] and [[Elowen]]. He warned them there were other blightlords, and asked them to bring news of his death, and the [[Keystone]], to the [[Nentyarch]], who ruled at the time from his seat-in-exile in [[Yeshelmaar]]. Marrec attempted to heal the druid, but he perished of his wounds soon after anyway.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|85-88|10}}",
