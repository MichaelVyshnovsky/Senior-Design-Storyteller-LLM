Zendaros Rallogar was a Tethyrian human man living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was the proprietor of Rallogar Hardware.
Zendaros was in business with Rallogar Hardware by 1358 DR. He was still in business through 1369 DR, and in 1374 DR.
He pretended to have an extreme hatred for magic, and forced customers who asked about magic items out of the store. However, he was a practicing wizard and actually ran a prosperous black market trade in magic items, weapons, armor and so on. One of his employees later approached the curious customer to broker a deal.
Zendaros had a large and unkempt mustache.
