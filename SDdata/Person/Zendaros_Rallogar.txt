'''Zendaros Rallogar''' was a [[Tethyrian]] [[human]] man living in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was the proprietor of [[Rallogar Hardware]].

Zendaros was in business with Rallogar Hardware by [[1358 DR]]. He was still in business through [[1369 DR]], and in [[1374 DR]].

He pretended to have an extreme hatred for magic, and forced customers who asked about [[magic item]]s out of the store. However, he was a practicing [[wizard]] and actually ran a prosperous black market trade in magic items, weapons, armor and so on. One of his employees later approached the curious customer to broker a deal.

Zendaros had a large and unkempt mustache.
