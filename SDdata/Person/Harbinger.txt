The Harbinger was a colossal wight in the service of Valindra Shadowmantle in 1479 DR.
During the Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge, the Harbinger led a host of undead in trying to break the walls of Neverwinter. He also acted as Valindra Shadowmantles bodyguard.
When an adventurer and Private Wilfred faced Valindra, she killed Wilfred and fled the battlefield, leaving the Harbinger behind to deal with the adventurer. In the ensuing battle, the adventurer defeated the Harbinger.
