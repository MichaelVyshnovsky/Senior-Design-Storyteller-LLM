The '''Harbinger''' was a colossal [[wight]] in the service of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
During [[the Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], the Harbinger led a host of [[undead]] in trying to break the walls of [[Neverwinter]]. He also acted as Valindra Shadowmantle's bodyguard.

When an [[adventurer]] and Private [[Wilfred]] faced Valindra, she killed Wilfred and fled the battlefield, leaving the Harbinger behind to deal with the adventurer. In the ensuing battle, the adventurer defeated the Harbinger.
