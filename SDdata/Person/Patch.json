        "mainbody": "'''Patch''' was the pet [[dog]] that belonged to one of the Crivens family members inhabiting the town of [[Reithwin]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Patch perished in a tragic event sometime before the fall of Reithwin, before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, and before it was consumed by the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]]. The event took the lives of almost every member of the Crivens clan, including Patch. The family was outlived only by [[Errick Crivens]], who was, in some way, the cause of the tragedy. Patch was buried in Reithwin's graveyard behind the [[House of Healing]] in a cluster surrounded by the graves of the family. The dog's tombstone read: \"Here rests Patch, loyal dog of the Crivens family, taken along with his master. Good boy.\" The Crivens family's grave markers remained relatively undamaged and legible as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
