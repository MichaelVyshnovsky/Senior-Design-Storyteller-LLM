        "mainbody": "Overseer Fanraet was one of the leaders of the Cult of the Dragon in the ruins of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR.\nIn 1369 DR, Fanraet oversaw the excavations and research of the ruins of the Room of Words in Onaglym of Myth Drannor. Lieutenant Iolrak was directly reporting to the Overseer of the missions progress. Even though there was not much progress in the recovery of the Word of Oblivion, his cultists were able to collect many other glyphs and words of power that opened previously sealed areas within the Dwarven Dungeons, Elven Catacombs, and other parts of Myth Drannor.\nHowever, for his failures, Overseer Fanraet was beheaded by Grand Overseer Vidorus as per Kya Mordrayns orders. The unlucky overseers head was sent as a dire warning to Overseer Sinod."
