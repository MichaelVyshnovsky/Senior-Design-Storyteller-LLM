Ajhuu was a powerful marid leader during the time of the Calim Empire.
He was one of Calims most powerful allies but grew frustrated when Calim capitulated to the elves of Keltormir and the dwarves of Shanatar to fix his borders at the edges of their realms. Ajhuu was one of several powerful genies who broke from Calims alliance to establish their own realms.
By the time Calim returned to his seat of power in Calimport, the city of Ajhuutal had already been built. Calim was determined to bring the rogue genies back under his exclusive control and waged war on Ajhuu, starting the Steam Clashes. Calim won the wars but they took a heavy toll on both sides and the surrounding land.
