'''Ajhuu''' was a powerful [[marid]] leader during the time of the [[Calim Empire]].<ref name=EotSS-pp11-12>

He was one of [[Calim]]'s most powerful allies but grew frustrated when Calim capitulated to the [[elves]] of [[Keltormir]] and the [[dwarves]] of [[Shanatar]] to fix his borders at the edges of their realms. Ajhuu was one of several powerful [[genies]] who broke from Calim's alliance to establish their own realms.<ref name=EotSS-pp11-12/>

By the time Calim returned to his seat of power in [[Calimport]], the city of '''Ajhuutal''' had already been built. Calim was determined to bring the rogue genies back under his exclusive control and waged war on Ajhuu, starting the [[Steam Clashes]]. Calim won the wars but they took a heavy toll on both sides and the surrounding land.<ref name=EotSS-pp11-12/>
