'''Garesh''' was a lieutenant of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] during the occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] under direct command of Overseer [[Sinod]].

==History==
Garesh was one of the cultists who were led by [[Kya Mordrayn]] in 1369 DR into the ruins of the ancient elven city to take control of a ''[[pool of radiance]]'' in the basement of [[Castle Cormanthor]]. During that time lieutenant Garesh was tasked to hunt down a band of [[orog]] mercenaries who rebelled against their cultist masters stripping souls off their kin, tuning them into subservient living [[zombie]]-like creatures. According to the notes left behind in the [[Elven Catacombs]], he was also the cruel prison warden who ordered torturing of [[Athan]] after his capture.
