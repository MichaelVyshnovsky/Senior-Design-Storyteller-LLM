{{Quote|''Baldur's Gate's never going to be safe with the Absolute out there - why would the Gazette lie to an entire city?''|Porter Juxon}}

==Description==
Porter was a human man with light skin, gray eyes, and black curly hair. His black mustache and mutton chops were properly groomed and shaped.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the threat of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Porter could often be seen arguing with [[hin]] friend, [[Bliggerillo]], over the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]]'' gazette's reliability and its claims that the walls of the Gate would protect its citizens. Bliggerillo showed no confidence in the [[broadsheet]]'s propaganda, unlike Porter. The human believed that the broadsheet would never lie to the entire city.
