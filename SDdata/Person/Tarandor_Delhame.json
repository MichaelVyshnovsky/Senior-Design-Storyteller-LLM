        "mainbody": "arandor Delhame was a powerful mage living in Iriaebor in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR. \nHe was the former apprentice of the apprentice of the archmage Meritheus, who trapped Jack Ravenwild in the mythal beneath Ravens Bluff in 1372 DR.\nIn the , the High House of Magic learned that Jack had escaped his confinement in the mythal and notified Tarandor who was obligated to his master to recapture Jack.  Tarandor tricked Jack into meeting him at a warehouse, where he shrunk Jack and placed him into a bottle for easy transport to the mythal. Jack, however, was able to use a spell from the Sarkonagael to escape his confinement. Later, Jack tricked Tarandor into purchasing a shadow simulacrum of Jack for 2,000 gold pieces. Thinking he had the real Jack, Tarandor imprisoned the simulacrum in the mythal stone, though it also escaped when the mythal was destroyed."
