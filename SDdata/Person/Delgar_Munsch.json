        "mainbody": "Delgar Munsch was a hunter at Bridgefort in Boareskyr Bridge around 1368 DR.\nHe owned a cabin in the area, where Delgar and his company of hunters took their prey, including goblins and orcs, which they later sold at Baldurs Gate. Around 1367 DR, he retired after a very good season but when the crusade of the Shining Lady arrived nearby he joined the crusaders, even becoming an officer.\nHe was a man with an inflated sense of his own importance but he was a superb hunter."
