        "mainbody": "'''Delgar Munsch''' was a hunter at [[Bridgefort]] in [[Boareskyr Bridge]] around [[1368 DR]].\n\nHe owned a cabin in the area, where Delgar and his company of hunters took their prey, including [[goblin]]s and [[orc]]s, which they later sold at [[Baldur's Gate]]. Around [[1367 DR]], he retired after a very good season but when the [[crusade of the Shining Lady]] arrived nearby he joined the crusaders, even becoming an officer.\n\nHe was a man with an inflated sense of his own importance but he was a superb hunter."
