        "mainbody": "'''Thaelder''' was the house [[wizard]] of the noble House [[Spurbright]] of [[Cormyr]], and secretly a [[War Wizard]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, Thaelder was in the employ of [[Elvarr Spurbright]] of the Spurbright family. Like many of the house wizards that worked for Cormyrean noble houses, Thaelder was a War Wizard spy, the fact that Elvarr Spurbright was aware of. Thaelder used his magics to ream the minds of the members of the Spurbright family nightly for any information deemed important by the War Wizards. Elvarr acquired several [[enchanted]] pieces of ''[[magecloak]]'' jewelry, priced at more than an entire tallhouse in [[Suzail]]. Thaelder could not access the nobleman's thoughts nor magically listen to his conversation when ''magecloak'' was worn.\n\nElvarr Spurbright and his son [[Torsard Spurbright]] discussed the rumored corruption of the Dragon Crown â€“ Royal Family [[Obarskyr]], shielded by ''magecloaks'' from Thaelder's surveillance."
