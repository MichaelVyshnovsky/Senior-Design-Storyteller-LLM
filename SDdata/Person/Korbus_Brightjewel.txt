Korbus Brightjewel was the owner and proprieter of Korbuss Jewelry and Fine Ornaments in Daggerford.
An expert jeweler, Korbus could easily have found work at the higher-class venue of Waterdeep but prefered the life that could only be found in a small town. He was also an expert at identifying all gems, magical or otherwise.
His home was located along Tymora Alley in north central Daggerford behind the Harvest House.
