To have a private conversation with Jarlaxle, Gromph transported M'tarl to an extra-dimensional realm.In the novel ''[[Siege of Darkness]]'', Gromph takes Jarlaxle into an extra-dimensional pocket and destroys a [[zombie]] servant with fire. While there is no concrete evidence this zombie is M'tarl, the question is still presented for the reader.
