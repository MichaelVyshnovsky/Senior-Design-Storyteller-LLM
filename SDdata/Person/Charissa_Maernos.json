        "mainbody": "'''Charissa Maernos''' was a priestess of [[Tyr]] in [[Westgate]] around [[1374 DR]].",
        "History": "Charissa was a priestess of Tyr and a very strict woman, obsessed with always remarking on other people's actions. She proposed that churches of Tyr and of [[Lathander]] should be more direct in fighting evil. In truth, all her anger derived from a man who had ruined her family.\n\nIn 1374 DR, Charissa may have helped an adventurer to fight the [[Night Masks]]. During that time, she found the man who had ruined her family and needed to decide whether to kill him or not."
