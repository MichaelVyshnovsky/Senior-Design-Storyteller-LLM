        "mainbody": "Narulph was a highknight of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nNarulph was strongly biased towards doing nothing.\nHe was a Highknight of Cormyr.\nDuring the mission to Shadowdale, Narulph was under the direct command of Eskrel Starbridge.\nNarulph was tapped by Eskrel Starbridge as part of the task force he decided to personally lead a search for the fugitive Elminster Aumar in the , despite his protests.\nDuring the raid in a cave full of doppelgangers, where one of these creatures pretended to be Elminster, Narulph had to be ordered by Eskrel not to pursue the creature once it fled. Later, Narulph was one of the members of the group when they captured Storm Silverhand, believing her to be another possible Elminster imposter. When she revealed herself to be a noble of Cormyr and the ranking Highknight, he was severely mystified, and she proceeded to outmaneuver his commanding officer so deftly that Starbridge gave away Filfaeril Obarskyrs teleport ring before any of the knights even understood what was happening. Narulph called him out on this, but Starbridge dismissed such concerns."
