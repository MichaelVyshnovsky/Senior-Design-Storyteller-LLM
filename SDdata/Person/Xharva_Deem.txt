'''Xharva Deem''' was a [[dao]] in service to the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] at the [[Temple of the Black Earth]] in [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], [[Marlos Urnrayle]] made a pact with Xharva Deem in order to use the dao's abilities to manage the forge for the Black Earth. She respected the pact and worked at the forge with two [[duergar]] assistants.
