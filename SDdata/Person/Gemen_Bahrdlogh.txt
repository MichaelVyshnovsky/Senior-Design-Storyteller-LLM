'''Gemen Bahrdlogh''' was a [[duergar]] blade-smith of renown in [[Gracklstugh]] in [[1484 DR]].

==Activities==
Gemen managed one of the best weapon-shops in Gracklstugh. He was a premier craftsman thanks to his ability to create [[magic weapon]]s.
 
==History==
In 1484 DR, just after the start of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the [[derro]] assistants of Gemen went crazy because of the effects of the [[Demon Weave]]. However, an adventuring party sent by [[Axelcrantz]] helped Gemen to resolve the situation.
