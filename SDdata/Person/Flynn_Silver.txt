Flynn Silver was a convicted murderer from the city of Baldurs Gate, who lived some years before the late 15 century DR.
Some years before the , Flynn Silver was arrested for the murder of William Lister and Simon "Simmie" Trynt. The state prosecutors of Baldurs Gate claimed that the perpetrator committed the murder as a part of some ritual honoring one of or all the Dead Three – Bane, Bhaal, or Myrkul. The dead bodies were discovered mutilated and shaped into some unholy totem. Despite the evidence, the defendant claimed that the murder was committed simply as a payback for being cut out of a lucrative deal. Flynn claimed he knew nothing of the mutilation, nor did he worship any of the Dead Three gods. The courts verdict was "guilty." Flynn Silver was sentenced to death, commuted to being banished to not anger any of the deities. The hearing was recorded as Case File #846.
By 1492 DR, copies of Case File #846 were old, and their ink – faded. Copies of the said record could be found sold in The Bibliophile, a bookshop in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. One copy was found in the Waukeens Rest inn in the Chionthar Valley, east of the Gate, and another copy – stored within an ancient mausoleum at the Lower City Graveyard.
