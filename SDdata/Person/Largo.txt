==Description==
Largo was a portly man with sun-kissed skin.

==History==
Largo was a lowly commoner in his youth. His attitude towards the rich and noble of Athkatla, as well as his lack of status and [[coin]] led him to be thrown out of the [[Mithrest Inn]] a couple of times. Later in life, Largo discovered a rich mithral deposit that made him wealthy enough to gain entrance to the posh establishment like the inn that once barred him from entry. By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Largo could often be found in the Mithrest. Despite his wealth, he still thought the rich to be bastards who only cared about his gold-filled purse.
