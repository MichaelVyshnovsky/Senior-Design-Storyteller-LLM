He met up with the party at [[Caer-Konig]], and helped them buy the supplies they would need at [[Frozenfar Expeditions]]. Among the group were the [[goliath]] [[Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi|Mokingo Akannathi]], a [[Yondalla]]n [[halfling]] named [[Perilou Fishfinger]], and a foul-mouthed [[tiefling]] called [[Astrix]].\n\nWhile they were traversing the mountain side, the group was attacked by a [[yeti]] and seperated from one another.\n\nA few days later, his husband Keegan hired some adventurers to find Garret's whereabouts."
