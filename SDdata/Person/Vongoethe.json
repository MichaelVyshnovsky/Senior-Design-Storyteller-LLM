        "mainbody": "'''Vongoethe'''<ref group=\"note\">Vongoethe's name is reminiscent of [[Wikipedia:Johan Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who wrote [[Wikipedia:Goethe's Faust|a version of ''Faust'']], the classic story about a man selling his soul. Likewise, a [[Wikipedia:Christopher Marlowe|Christopher Marlowe]] originally penned the play [[Wikipedia:The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]. was a [[lich]] from [[Calimshan]]. He had come to the town in pursuit of a man called [[Marlowe]] and set up a lair in the cave used as a graveyard for the village.",
        "Powers": "In the fashion of many liches, Vongoethe was extremely powerful in combat compared to most creatures. He had accumulated a lot of power in his time as a lich, and could cast the most challenging spells in the [[Realms]], such as ''[[Dragon's Breath]]''. He could also cast spells a lot more quickly than the average magic user. In addition, he was defended by a host of [[undead]] including two [[banshee]]s.",
        "Possessions": "As well as Malla's soul in the form of an [[ioun stone]], he owned a [[ring of anti-venom]], which made him immune to all poisons when worn.",
        "History": "The party of [[Gorion's Ward]] may have first have heard about Vongoethe from [[Marlowe]], who asked for their help. He told them that the lich was after his daughter, [[Malla]], and had stolen her soul. Marlowe arranged access to a cave through a magical barrier that [[Balthazar]]'s [[monks]] set up around the cave to keep Vongoethe from escaping. Once encountered, however, Vongoethe recognized the ward as a [[Bhaalspawn|\"godling\"]]. The lich was more than willing to talk and reveal that it was Marlowe's soul he was after. The lich needed a soul given willingly, and Marlowe had bargained for his earlier on in exchange for worldly wealth and good fortune, but then escaped when payment was due.\n\nThe lich may have destroyed the stone containing Malla's soul if directly attacked. Otherwise, he was willing to hand it over in return for Marlowe being brought to him and made to willingly relinquish his own soul. Marlowe was willing to do so to save his daughter, and [[Gorion's Ward]] was given her soul, in the form of a a powerful but evil ioun stone."
