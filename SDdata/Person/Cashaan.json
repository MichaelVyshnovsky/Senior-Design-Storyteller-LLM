        "mainbody": "Calimshan, West Faerûn\nCashaan el Farid, often referred to as just Cashaan or Cashaan the Red, was the leader of the reformed Host Tower of the Arcane in the 15 century DR.\nCashaan was crafty and used his knowledge and upbringing from Calimshan to take advantage of the desperate Luskar people.\nAs a powerful necromancer, Cashaan commanded all of the undead creatures that roamed the Host Tower. As Archmage Arcane, Cashaan the Red was the highest-ranking wizard of the Host Tower and was superior to the Overwizards of the other spires Zelenn the White, Jendrick the Blue, Teyva the Gray, and Druette the Raven.\nCashaan el Farid hailed from Calimshan in west Faerûn. After the defeat of Arklem Greeth, former Archmage Arcane, Cashaan and his fellows began to rebuild the Arcane Brotherhoods trade routes. As of 1485 DR, he began to recruit adventurers to help make Luskan a more peaceful town, as merchants would rarely visit the city. He did this in a cautious, secretive manner, in order to keep the revival of the Arcane Brotherhood from the ears of others. Cashaan was the Archmage Arcane by 1489 DR."
