        "mainbody": "Kralgar Bonesnapper was the chieftain of the Uthgardt Griffon tribe who ruled Griffons Nest during the midâ€”14 century DR. \nKralgar put little faith in the power of magic.\nHe endlessly struggled to fulfill his goal of conquering and ruling one of the great cities of the North.\nKralgar wanted most to be enthroned in Silverymoon, and would almost be content with Everlund, if the city were more significant and defensable. He would likely settle for Neverwinter, Mirabar, Sundabar or Everlund.\nDespite his beliefs, Kralgar acquired quite a number of magical items in his quest for power."
