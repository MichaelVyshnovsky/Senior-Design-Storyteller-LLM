'''Balant Mornlight''' was a [[halfling]] [[fighter]] adventurer of infamous ill luck, active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Balant hailed from a tiny hamlet just outside the town of [[Whitehorn]] in the [[White Peaks]] of the [[Moonsea North]]. Ever since he was a child, Balant was prone to legendarily bad luck. He accidentally burned his hamlet to the ground while still a kid, ensuring it disappeared from the 14{{th}} century maps. His adventuring career was mostly uneventful. Balant's most grievous wound came from him once running headfirst into a [[tree]] while fleeing from his paramour's scorned partner. Another adventure of note was when Balant Mornlight traveled with a caravan through a desert. The halfling's bad luck was so immense, the caravan faced a freak thunderstorm tuned flood. The caravan's destruction ended Balant's employment with it. By the time the halfling fighter reached the age of 51, he was believed to be a jinx by most.

Sometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Balant Mornlight was among ambitions adventurers who was interested in being sent to a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths.
