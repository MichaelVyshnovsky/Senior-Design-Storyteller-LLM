}}'''Eira''' was a [[wood elf]] in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==History==
Eira was one of the many [[Chosen]] captured by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and transported to the Doomvault dungeon for experiments. More specifically, she was the chosen of [[Rillifane Rallathil]], a minor god of the [[Seldarine]]. In one of the experiments, Eira was infused with the essence of a sacrificed Chosen of [[Talona]], a process that left Eira with half of her life energy.

Eira was freed from her chains by the heroes of [[Daggerford]] and she asked to join them in the fight against the [[Thayans]]. However, in battle, there was a 50% chance that she would manifest the Talona side and fought with no concern for her own safety.
