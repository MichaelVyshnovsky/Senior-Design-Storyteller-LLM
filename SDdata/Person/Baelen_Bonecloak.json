        "mainbody": "'''Baelen Bonecloak''' was a shopkeep from [[Baldur's Gate]] and the co-proprietor of [[Bonecloak's|the shop]] that bore his family's name, along with his wife [[Derryth Bonecloak|Derryth]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Bealen's meek now, but he used to be a rotten old bastard. Treated me like an old shoe for seventy years.|[[Derryth Bonecloak|Derryth]], Baelen's wife.}}",
        "Personality": "For much of his life Baelan was a troubled and brutish man. He was an alocoholic and nearly ruined his family's business by spending their money on drink.\n\nAt some point Baelen became ''[[feeblemind]]ed'' and underwent a rapid change in personality. While could hardly speak in full sentences, and had trouble with complex directions, he became a much kinder man.",
        "Abilities": "Despite his condition and change in capabilities, Baelan was still capable of casting [[spell]]s from [[scroll]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Baelen and Derryth were married for over 70 years, most of which he spent acting in a horrid manner. He was abusive towards Derryth and for some reason or another, the pair stuck together.",
        "History": "Facing financial troubles, Derryth took Baelen down with her into the [[Underdark]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. They hoped to recover some specimens of the [[noblestalk]] mushrooms. While Baelen became close to plucking one form the ground, he lost his pack, somehow injured himself, and became trapped behind a large grouping of [[bibberbang]]s, unable to maneuver his way out."
