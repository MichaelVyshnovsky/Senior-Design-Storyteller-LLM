'''Rihuud''' was a [[stone giant]] living in [[Gracklstugh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Rihuud was one of the apprentices of Stonespeaker [[Hgraam]], leader of [[Clan Cairngorm]].''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], during a rite of "communing with the stone", he went mad from [[demon]]ic energies unleashed in the [[Underdark]] and went on a rampage in the streets. Fellow apprentice [[Dorhun]] was tasked with taking him back alive to their quarters.
