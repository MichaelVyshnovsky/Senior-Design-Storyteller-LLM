High Lama '''Torgoja P'a''' was a [[human]] [[monk]] and [[lama]] of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] dwelling on [[Mount Or-Ghash]] in the [[Chigidi Mountains]] on the [[Plain of Horses]] ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.Torgoja's faith is unknown, but is assumed to be the Path of Enlightenment because of his red robes and ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms: Volume I'' pages 84–85 stating that this is a common faith of the Plain of Horses followed by "most" lamas there.

==History==
P'a's early life was little known. He first appeared in the Plain of Horses around {{YearlinkConvert|2592|SY}}, seeming to be nothing more than a nomad with two black [[camel]]s who arrived at [[Alamaqu]], a city of the [[T'aghur]] tribe. But only days later he had persuaded local rebel leaders to give up their plan to depose the tribe's ruling triumvirate.

He went west and stopped in [[Peqqir]], where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to [[mulberry]] farms on mountain slopes. The grateful [[Guychiang]] tribe offered to construct a temple in his honor, but P'a refused and continued on his way.

After a while, around {{YearlinkConvert|2597|SY}}, P'a made his home on Mount Or-Ghash and became the high lama there.

==Personality==
Although he preferred the company of his two camels to that of his fellow lamas, P'a was known to be amiable and nice. He had a reputation for wisdom and a noble spirit.

==Activities==
Many people, from farmers to nobles, came to ask P'a for his counsel and he welcomed all of them.

==Description==
He was plump of body, with bushy eyebrows and a short brown beard. His youthful appearance belied his age—he looked to be only around 30 years old around, despite his past—and he would never say how old he really was.

He wore a red [[robe]] that was old, tattered, and had numerous repairs.
