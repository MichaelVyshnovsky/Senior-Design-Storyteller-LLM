'''Lorlynn Zmirth''' was a [[drow]] [[mage]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Around the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Lorlynn and her twin brother [[Elvilac Zmirth]] went into Undermontain hoping to collect powerful [[spellbook]]s. While searching separately inside the [[Obstacle Course]] level, however, the [[Netherskull]] killed Elvilac. Lorlynn was unaware of this and still awaited the return of her brother. If she learned about the death of Elvilac, she would try to recover his body and reanimate him as an [[undead]].

==Personality==
Lorlynn hated all people apart from her brother.
