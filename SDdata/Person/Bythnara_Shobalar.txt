Bythnara Shobalar was a drow from House Shobalar daughter of Xandra Shobalar.
She was envious of Liriel Baenre, feeling that Xandra gave her too much affection and that male drow preferred her.
Bythnaras mother was Xandra Shobalar.
Bythnara studied magic under the instruction of her mother Bythnara was required to kill a goblin for the Blooding coming-of-age ritual. This was considered a weak foe compared to the usually more intelligent or dangerous creatures pitted against drow in this ceremony, and she resented the teasing it brought upon her.
Bythnara and Liriel had a strong rivalry, having grown up together. In 1361 DR, Bythnara planned to dispose of her, so Liriel preemptively pushed Bythnara into a lake of flesh-eating pyrimo fish. Their friend Syzwick witnessed the murder but swore never to speak of it.
