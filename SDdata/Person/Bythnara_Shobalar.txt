'''Bythnara Shobalar''' was a [[drow]] from [[House Shobalar]] daughter of [[Xandra Shobalar]].

==Personality==
She was envious of Liriel Baenre, feeling that Xandra gave her too much affection and that male drow preferred her.

==Relationships==
Bythnara's mother was [[Xandra Shobalar]].

==History==
Bythnara studied [[magic]] under the instruction of her mother Bythnara was required to kill a [[goblin]] for the [[Blooding]] coming-of-age ritual. This was considered a weak foe compared to the usually more intelligent or dangerous creatures pitted against drow in this ceremony, and she resented the teasing it brought upon her.

Bythnara and Liriel had a strong rivalry, having grown up together. In [[1361 DR]], Bythnara planned to dispose of her, so Liriel preemptively pushed Bythnara into a lake of flesh-eating ''[[pyrimo]]'' fish. Their friend [[Syzwick]] witnessed the murder but swore never to speak of it.
