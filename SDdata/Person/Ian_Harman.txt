'''Ian Harman''' was a male [[human]] of the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Ian was a member of the militia of [[West Harbor]]. Strangely, he was usually seen as a coward, who'd rather flee from a fight than join it. 
The [[Kalach-Cha]] considered asking him to join the fight against the [[bladeling]]s and [[duergar]] that invaded in [[1374 DR]]. However, whether he fought or not, Ian was killed in the battle.
