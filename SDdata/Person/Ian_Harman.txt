Ian Harman was a male human of the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Ian was a member of the militia of West Harbor. Strangely, he was usually seen as a coward, whod rather flee from a fight than join it. 
The Kalach-Cha considered asking him to join the fight against the bladelings and duergar that invaded in 1374 DR. However, whether he fought or not, Ian was killed in the battle.
