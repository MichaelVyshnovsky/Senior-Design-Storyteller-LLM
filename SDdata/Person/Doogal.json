        "mainbody": "'''Doogal''' was a no-good trapper, brother to [[Dolan]] and [[Digby]], from the town of [[Lonelywood]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Don't know nothin' about the barbarians. All I know about this town is that it's filled with washed-up losers. Be fine, though, if it weren't for that do-gooder Emmerich.''|Doogal}}",
        "Description": "Dolan was a [[human]] male with light skin and light chestnut hair who spoke in hardened and curt manner.",
        "Possessions": "He wore a set of [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[studded leather armor]] and carried a magic ''[[charged battle axe]].''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protector's rules. To [[Emmerich Hawk]]'s disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the [[Lonely Wood]] without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only cared about skinning and selling as many [[rabbit]], [[elk]], and even [[bear]]s, as possible. Doogal was a de-facto leader of the trio and thought Emmerich to be an annoying sniveling brat, who was just one confrontation away from facing with violence."
