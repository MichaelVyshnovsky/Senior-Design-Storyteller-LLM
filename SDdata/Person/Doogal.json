        "mainbody": "Doogal was a no-good trapper, brother to Dolan and Digby, from the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 century DR.\nDolan was a human male with light skin and light chestnut hair who spoke in hardened and curt manner.\nHe wore a set of enchanted +1 studded leather armor and carried a magic charged battle axe..\nIn the , three new residents arrived in Lonelywood â€“ three trappers who did not abide by the local ranger-protectors rules. To Emmerich Hawks disdain, the brothers set out to trap forest beasts in the Lonely Wood without any regard for the damage they were doing to the forest. Digby and his brothers only cared about skinning and selling as many rabbit, elk, and even bears, as possible. Doogal was a de-facto leader of the trio and thought Emmerich to be an annoying sniveling brat, who was just one confrontation away from facing with violence."
