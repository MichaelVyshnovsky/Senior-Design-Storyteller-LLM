'''Alkindus''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who performed their research at the [[Shadow Consortium]] before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==History==
Following the disappearance of the institute's founder, [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]], Alkindus performed experimental research into the [[planes]] at the head of a small team. Focusing on the unlikely possibilities of [[semiplane]]s and [[antiplane]]s, she was aided by [[Janin]], [[Pringle]], [[Vanderanus]], and [[Shiris Blamira]].
