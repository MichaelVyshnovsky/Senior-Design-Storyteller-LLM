{{quote|''My nose tells me there is "opportunity" in this cellar. Granda [[Retsotnert Doogrick|Retsotnert]] had a keen nose too. Bigger and hairier though.''|Purfbin Doogrick}}

==Description==
Purfbin was a portly young gnome with shaggy curly blond hair and black, slightly bulging eyes. One of his front teeth was noticeably chipped. Purfbin wore brightly colored jacket of many pockets, each overstuffed with valuables and gadgets.

==Personality==
Purfbin Doogrick smiled often and possessed a mischievous streak. [[Trulit & Greegon's claret]] was one of Purfbin's favorite libations, he could detect its smell from a distance even if it was sealed in waxed casks. Like many of his fellow gnomes, Purfbin loved [[cheese]], in moderation, of course, and hated feeling even slightest hint hunger.

However cheerful and eccentric the gnome appeared to be, he missed his home and family greatly, often tearing up when talking bout the Doogrick clan burrows.

His main motivator in life was avarice. He loved [[gold]], [[silver]], and had especial weakness for [[gem]]s.

==Abilities==
Purfbin Doogrick considered himself to be a "professional treasure hunter", and not a thug or a thief. He honed his roguish skills in acquiring and recovering rare artifacts. That profession often brought him to antagonize with other thieves by stealing from them said powerful artifacts.

Purfbin always tinkered with his weapons and armor, often actually making useful alterations.

==Possessions==
''[[Purfbin's clothes]]'' were far from fashionable and were eccentrically dyed, but enchanted his roguish skills. ''[[Purfbin's crossbow]]'' was a powerful invention that could shoot a seemingly unlimited number of ''[[bolt of lightning|bolts of lightning]]'' along with regular [[crossbow]] ammunition. He also had a ''[[potion of healing|potion of cure light wounds]]'' handy.

==Relationships==
Purfbin often said that the home was wherever he found a safe place to sleep, however he missed his mode and family greatly. The Doogrick clan burrows were located somewhere to the south of Daggerford. The family was typical for gnomish standards, however Purfbin's favorite family member was Retsotnert Doogrick, a famous and quite an eccentric inventor.

==History==
{{fq
| text = Love… family… these things only lead to unhappiness in the end. Wealth, on the other hand, has no strings attached. Its bounty is pure pleasure, purchased at a whim and kept for as long as is necessary. I believe if a gnome is rich enough, and is willing to spread the wealth accordingly, his family might call him successful, and perhaps overlook his past transgressions.

Sometime before Purfbin set out to adventure, he lived with this family in Doogrick clan burrows. From that time Purfbin fondly remembered an incident when his grandfather Retsotnert cobbled together a flying machine out of twigs, grease, and cogs. The young gnome accompanied his grandfather on the invention's maiden flight. The machine managed to fly several feet before falling apart to Purfbin and Retsotnert's grand joy and thunderous laughter.

As a youth, Purfbin wanted to become a famous inventor like his grandfather. The gnome invented a terrifying invention he named [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]] to help with peeling [[potato]]s for the annual grand [[Harvest Stew]] served during the [[New Harvest Festival]]. Gnome youth was always tasked with the chore, and one year, Purfbin decided to unveil his invention in front of the festival guests, hoping for praise and accolades for the grand invention. The burrows' Chief Cook [[Bitty Bitterbreath]] allowed the demonstration, and Purfbin fired up the Shred-o-Matic 1000 within the eyesight of the most important attendees. The gnome could imagine his machine displayed in [[Gond's High House of Wonders]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], displayed alongside other grand inventions such as [[Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger]] and [[Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower]]. Daydreaming, Purfbin did not notice something jamming in the machine's navigation. Instead of moving towards a mountain of potatoes, Shred-o-Matic 1000 moved towards [[Mayor Whimblesnort]] and her new expensive [[silk]] hat, then [[Dame Edza]]'s prized wig. The guests' screams of terror could be heard for miles around as the machine continued shredding the most expensive pieces of guests' finery. This incident became a disgrace for clan Doogrick.

During Purfbin's time in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], he used his roguish skills to the fullest; however, food was just as valuable to the gnome as coins and gems. One misadventure came his way when [[Lady Spitalsmore]] unexpectedly returned home earlier than anticipated. The diminutive thief was stuck in the noblewoman's dark basement as Lady Spitalsmore settled in her kitchen for a cup of afternoon [[tea]]. Threatened by hunger and the dreaded threat of missing a meal, Purfbin emptied the many pockets of his gaudy outfit. What appeared to be useless junk became invaluable tools of escape. The gnome slid a shard of a [[mirror]] under the basement door to survey the tea room. Next, he used wire to construct an intricate trap. A trap for [[lizard]]s! And dead [[Modovian dung beetle]]s served as bait. The captive lizard was pushed through into the lady's kitchen as a distraction. Purfbin slid out of the basement while the terrified shrieking noblewoman evacuated the premises. The gnome snuck out of her abode but not before gathering copious foodstuffs from her kitchen.

In 1372 DR, Purfbin Doogrick "hitched a ride" in [[Falias Emberthumb]]'s caravan trying to escape jail sentence in Waterdeep after he was accused of lifting a purse off of a Waterdhavian noble, [[Lord Thunderfist]]. The disgruntled noble threatened the gnome with hanging with no proper trial after Purfbin tried to claim that the Lord's purse simply fell on him like an [[apple]] off a tree.

During the travel along the [[Trade Way]], Zhentarim agents disguised as bandits ambushed the trade caravan and magically abducted one of the caravan guard hirelings, a fighter [[Talarenne]], leaving behind her best friend, later came to be known as the hero of Daggerford. Purfbin Doogrick aided the caravaners fighting off the bandits and agreed to help with the hero's quest of rescue of their friend in exchange for splitting the loot.

At the site of the  ambush the duo met [[Astriel Shalyn]], secretly an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]], who looked somewhat similar to the hero's kidnapped friend.
