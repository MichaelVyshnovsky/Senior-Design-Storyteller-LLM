'''Karajah''' was a renowned pit fighter champion from [[Calimshan]] who lived some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Karajah became famous for remaining the undefeated [[gladiator]] for a decade while wearing nothing by a [[leather armor]] and armed with spiked [[gauntlet]]s. It was believed that Karajah was impervious to his opponents' attacks until it was discovered that his armor possessed a powerful [[enchantment]]. This revelation angered the pit-fighting spectators, and they overpowered Karajah and threw him into a pit with a well-armed [[ogre]] who broke every bone in the fighter's body while the armor itself remained undamaged. The armor later became known as ''[[Karajah's Life and Death]]''.
