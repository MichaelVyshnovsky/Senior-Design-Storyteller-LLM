Though she was known for her kindness, she and the rest of the Scantshar family were distrusted and treated with slight suspicion by other folk of Sevenecho. This was largely due to Riliyyns skills as a wizard.\nRiliyyn was a wizard of some accomplishment. In an emergency or trouble at The Worried Wyvern, Sevenechos inn, Riliyyn could be called upon by Beliot Sevenecho to provide magical assistance.\nGiven Riliyyns seniority and authority, she may also be a member of the council of elders that governs the hamlet of Sevenecho.\nRiliyyn once made a study of the orc- and monster-infested Glorming Pass north of Sevenecho, and theorized that some evil entity, likely a wizard, a lich, or possibly even an alhoon, dwelled in nearby parts of the Earthfast Mountains. She also believed that it kept a deepspawn in the area to spawn creatures that would discourage explorers from finding its lair."
