        "mainbody": "Human\nJhingleshod (\nAs of the late 14 century DR, Jhingleshod spent his entire existence roaming around the Dire Wood searching for some means to destroy Wulgreth and finally achieve peace.\nIn the , Jhingleshod left Hellgate Keep with his master Wulgreth, who was fleeing from the influx of fiends. They traveled to the ruins of Karse where Wulgreth hoped to gain power from the petrified body of Karsus. While in the midst of casting a powerful epic spell, Jhingleshod turned on his master and slew him to prevent him from summoning more fiends. a patch of petrified trees that became overrun with undead.\nThe undead mage hunted Jhingleshod down and punished his former servant by torturing him until death. \nJust as his master, Jhingleshod arose as an undead monstrosity,\nIn the , Jhingleshod encountered the Evereskan tomb guardian Galaeron Nihmedu, along with his companions Vala Thorsdotter, Melegaunt Tanthul, and Malik el Sami, as the group passed through the Dire Wood. After assessing Galaerons character, Jhingleshod offered him a bargain he would guide the elf and his allies to the Karsestone in exchange for their help in destroying Wulgrath.\nJhingelshod and his companions traveled for some distance and eventually arrived at a black pyramid set atop the Karsus Butte, the petrified remains of the ascended arcanist after which it was named. After venturing within, they destroyed a demilich hoping it to be the remains of Wulgreth. Unfortunately they were mistaken, as the undead remains were merely those of an ancient sharn imprisoned within. \nJust as Jhingelshod resigned their efforts to failure, the lich Wulgrenth ambushed them just as they entered the chamber with the Karsestone. A fierce battle broke out and eventually Galaeron cleaved the lichs skull in half. At Jhingleshods direction, they gathered its remains and began the search for his phylactery. After staying overnight within the black pyramid and having no luck with their search, it gradually dawned on nearly all the members of the group the Karsestone itself was Wulgreths phylactery. Cursed by Mystra to always speak the truth, Malik inadvertently shared this revelation out loud, triggering Jhingleshods paranoia and rage. \nBelieving they wanted to steal the Karsestone with no intent of helping destroy Wulgreth, Jhingleshod attacked them all and nearly killed Vala. Galaeron drew upon the whole magic that permeated the Karsestone and shot a beam of gold energy, blasting the Iron Axeman in half. That was not enough to stop Jhingleshod, as his top half clung on to Galaeron as both they and the Karsestone shot out of Karsus remains into the pool below. Jhingleshods two halves reformed just as the Karsestone ascended into the skies and a mountain descended in its place. Jhingleshods ultimate fate was unknown however, as it was believed that Wulgreths undead remains were already reforming within the stone corpse of Karse."
