'''Lewy Jons' hog''' was a [[pig]] of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]], belonging to the farmer [[Lewy Jons]].

==History==
[[File:A man and his hog.jpg|left|thumb|''Lewy's hog being shrunk to its natural size.'']]
In the [[Harvest Fair]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Lewy attempted to win at the hog contest, cheating by using magic to enlarge his pig. [[Orlen]] had doubts and tasked the [[Kalach-Cha]] to investigate; Lewy was prepared to bribe them to avoid being exposed.

After the Harvest Fair, however, Lewy and his hog were killed by [[duergar]] and [[bladeling]] raiders.
