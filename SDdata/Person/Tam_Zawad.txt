'''Tam Zawad''' was a [[Harper]] and [[cleric|priest]] of [[Selûne]] living in the [[Sword Coast]] region of [[Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils}}

==Description==
Tam was a tall, thin middle-aged man with brown skin and curly dark hair with some grey in it.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|912}}

==History==
===Early Life===
Tam was born in [[Calimshan]]. As a young man while adventuring with friends, his entire group was slaughtered by [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] agents of Shade. He was the only survivor.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|1591}} From that moment onward, Tam decided to dedicate himself to Selûne.

Thereafter, Tam worked as a priest for a Harper cell on the southern Sword Coast. He met a girl and they had a daughter, [[Mira Zawad|Mira]], Tam's only child.

===Later Life===
At some point, Tam began living in the [[Sword Coast North|northern Sword Coast]] region. In the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, he met a [[dragonborn]] bounty hunter named [[Mehen]] and his two adopted [[tiefling]] daughters, [[Farideh]] and [[Havilar]]. Tam helped the group foil a plot by [[devils]] in Neverwinter.

Later that year, Tam was ordered by his Harper master to investigate antiquities in [[Waterdeep]], presumably to keep them out of the hands of [[Shadovar]]. He found a page from an ancient [[Netheril|Netherese]] magical book, the ''[[Book of Tarchamus]]'', as well as a fragment of a stone tablet that was apparently related to the book for sale by a Waterdavian merchant. Unfortunately, the price was too high for the Harpers and a shady caravan master named [[Adolican Rhand]] purchased the items. In an attempt to steal the page, Tam crashed a party Rhand threw to show off his acquisition but [[Zhentarim]] attacked before Tam could get the page. In the confusion that followed, Tam's young apprentice [[Dahl Peredur]] was able to grab the page.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|2536}}

With the help of Mira, Tam was able to identify the probable location of the page's origin, the ancient hidden [[Library of Tarchamus|library]] of [[Tarchamus the Unyielding]] near [[Everlund]]. Tam and a party consisting of Mira, Farideh, Havilar, Dahl, [[Aubrin Crownsilver|Brin Crownsilver]], and mercenaries allied with Mira traveled to the library. They found themselves trapped in the library with ancient Netherese [[ghost]]s and the [[mummy]] of Tarchamus. The group was able to reunite the page with the sentient book the page was taken from, the ''[[Book of Tarchamus]]'', and found a way to destroy Tarchamus and his minions, unfortunately destroying the library.

During the adventure, Tam learned from the mercenaries, who were actually Zhentish agents, that his Harper master in Waterdeep was a traitor.  After the group returned to Waterdeep, Tam confronted his master and used the telepathic abilities of the ''Book of Tarchamus'' to interrogate him and then presumably carry out the Harper punishment for treason: hanging.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|7032}}

==Relationships==
Tam had a somewhat frosty relationship with his daughter. Due to his work as a Harper agent, he rarely saw her when she was young. When she was grown, they rarely crossed paths. Although Tam seemed to be disturbed that Mira worked with Zhents, he still regarded her as a potential ally and even tried to recruit her to the Harpers.
