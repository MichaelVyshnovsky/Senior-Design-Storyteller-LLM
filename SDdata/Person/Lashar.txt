''Circa'' 1372 [[DR]], Lashar could always be found in front of his stall in the center of Liam's Hold, happily greeting travelers and offering them his fine wares. The half-orc had a humble selection of clothes, mundane armors, several weapons, ''[[potion of healing]]'', [[scroll]] [[parchment]], and various knick-knacks. He did, however kept an eye out for interesting artifacts and exotic items. Once such weapons was the ''[[Sword of the Sultans]]'' from the far East. He also sold ''[[phoenix extract]]s'' and ''[[acid bomb]]s''.
