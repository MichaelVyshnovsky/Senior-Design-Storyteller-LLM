Ilserv, also known as Ilserv of the Illithids, was a mind flayer sage in ChChitl in 1370 DR.
Ilserv originally acted as an emissary and ambassador of ChChitl to the surface until, by accident, the beholder crime lord Xanathar petrified him. For many years, Ilserv was one of the statues in a rock garden near Mirts mansion.
However, Ilserv maintained a little awareness and psychic power. Finally, in 1367 DR, Ilserv dominated the mind of a wizard guest of Mirt who reversed the transformation. Immediately, Ilserv returned to ChChitl, refusing to ever go back to the surface. Thereafter, he was considered the citys sage about all surface matters, thanks to knowledge gleaned from reading minds in the garden.
