'''Ungu Yakana''' was a [[wu jen]] in [[Ito-jo]] in [[Kozakura]].

==History==
Yakana was in service to the [[Ito family]] but secretly he worked for the clan's enemies, who paid him well. When this was discovered, he was imprisoned in the caves deep the castle. The ''[[ancient curse]]'' placed him under the service of the [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]] responsible for the Ito family's fall. He supplied it with its favorite [[cherry]] incense, assisted by three [[ju ju zombie]]s.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1433|KY}}, an adventuring party hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to recover the [[Seven Swords]] fought and destroyed him.
