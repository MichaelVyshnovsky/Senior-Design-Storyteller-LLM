Fanya bint Parigar was in charge of the Grand University of Huzuz located in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights in 1367 DR.
Fanya was a priest of Zann. She was a proficient teacher who knew several languages, including Shou Lin from the distant northeast.
She dreamed of the day that her school would be the grandest in all of Huzuz, though in reality she had a lot of work to do to accomplish such a feat.
