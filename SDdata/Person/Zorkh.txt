Zorkh was a stone giant hermit sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Zorkh was mute he could understand the Giant language but could not speak.
Zorkh lived as hermit in the Greypeak Mountains. He was always followed by six goats. He reacted friendlily to people.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the stone giants of Thane Kayalithica destroyed every building of the village Orlbar. Afterward, Zorkh decided to collect all the stones of the destroyed buildings, stacking them in creative ways, thus obtaining a "forest" of piled-up stones.
