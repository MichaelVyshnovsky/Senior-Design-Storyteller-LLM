'''Silence-Before-Iron''' was an adventuring [[tiefling]] [[monk]] of the [[Old Order]] and member of the [[Annals of Halgren]].

==Description==
Silence-Before-Iron was touched by the [[lower planes]], evident in her deathly white skin. The tiefling's fists were her main weapon; however, she was known to use [[sling]]s to pelt her opponents with [[bullet]]s.

==History==
Silence-Before-Iron hailed from the Land of Intrigue, [[Amn]]. She lived her life following the teachings of the mysterious monastic Old Order. Her vow of silence kept others at a distance, and her demonic blood did not encourage many to become close with the silent monk. Silence-Before-Iron's order believed in wielding ideas as weapons. The tiefling's ideals embraced silence, shadow, ice, fear, and wind.

In the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Silence-Before-Iron found herself in the northern city of [[Luskan]], where she joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries and Silence-Before-Iron gladly offered her fists.
