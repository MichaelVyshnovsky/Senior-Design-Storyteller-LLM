        "mainbody": "'''Aubree Lucent''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] and member of the [[Hellriders]] who served [[Elturel]] with honor during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was among those within the city immediately following [[the Descent|its Descent]] to the [[Nine Hells]], and famously confronted a powerful [[archdevil]] during her adventures.\n\n{{Quote|When I was a child, my father told me about a holy warrior who descended from above. He told me of the glory she brought to Elturel...the courage that inspired generations of paladins to fight evil every single day.|Aubree, speaking about the angel [[Zariel]] and [[the Ride]] into the Nine Hells.}}",
        "Personality": "While she was still young, Aubree was a devoted and determined paladin-in-training.",
        "Possessions": "Aubree's preferred weapon was a one-handed [[warhammer]].",
        "Relationships": "She was daughter of Sir [[Alusair Lucent]], a fellow paladin of Torm and knight of the Hellriders.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Aubree and her father were dispatched by High Overseer [[Thavius Kreeg]] to track down a group of thieves and recover an item stolen from his personal manor.\n\nWhile visiting [[Wyrm's Crossing]] at [[Baldur's Gate]], the two were attacked by the [[hell knight]] [[Haruman]]. The hellish warrior abducted the senior Lucent, along with the stolen item, and transported him back down to the Nine Hells. Distraught but determined to save her father, Aubree turned to the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] to help her save him from infernal damnation.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|3-9}} \n\n[[File:Aubree, Zariel.png|thumb|right|300px|''Aubree, facing down the Archduke of Avernus.'']]\nAubree and the adventurers learned that the stolen item was an ''[[infernal puzzle box]]'' they had recovered,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|13}} and traveled to [[Candlekeep]] to learn more.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|5-8}} While discussing her situation with Great Reader [[Sylvira Savikas]], Aubree and her allies were struck by a [[wild magic]] caused by the [[sorceress]] [[Delina]]. Aubree, Delina, and the other heroes were transported to Elturel, just as it had descended to [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|16-20}}\n\nFacing down the forces of the Hells in the streets of Elturel, Aubree, Delina, and the hero [[Minsc]] encountered Haruman and interrogated him for the location of Sir Alusair. They learned he and the other Hellriders of Elturel were to be sacrificed as part of some [[infernal contract]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|9-13}} \nAubree and Delina managed to track down the Hellriders. They learned that their former commander Thavius Kreeg was in fact a malevolent [[amnizu]] devil who forged the contract with the Archduke of Avernus. Aubree briefly reunited with her father before Archduke [[Zariel]] herself appeared before the group. While the fallen Zariel easily batted aside the heroes, Aubree confronted the fallen [[solar]] about her previous incarnation as a servant of [[Celestia]]. Zariel suffered a moment of personal crisis and eventually Elturel ascended from the Hells and returned to its place in [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|9-17}} \n\nAfter a few week's time, order was restored in the city of Elturel. Aubree was knighted as a full member of the Hellriders in a ceremony presided over by her father."
