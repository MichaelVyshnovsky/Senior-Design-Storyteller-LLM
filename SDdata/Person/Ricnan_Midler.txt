==Description==
Ricnan was a middle-aged man with tied-back brown hair and a neat brown [[waistcoat]] outfit.

==Relationships==
Ricnan was the son of [[Neris Midler|Neris]] and [[Ianhand Midler|Ianhand]], and brother of [[Quilynn Midler|Quilynn]]. He had wed [[Jandove Midler|Jandove]], and together they had their two sons [[Normon Midler|Normon]] and [[Thoben Midler|Thoben]].

==History==
During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.

Ricnan was held captive in the kitchen of the house, alongside his sister Quilynn and his son Normon, guarded by several drow invaders.
