        "mainbody": "'''Bestra Mornscroll''' was a female [[Chondathan]] [[human]] [[cleric]] of [[Shar]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Bestra Mornscroll was operating at the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]], directing the duped petitioners from the false [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] through the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] ''[[portal]]'' to their dooms.\n\nOnce, on the other side of the Dusk Lord's Passage, in the [[Shadow Citadel]], an acolyte was slain by the [[shadow elemental]] guardians of the ''[[Dusk Lord's throne]]''. Bestra ordered that it be left alone until she had time to destroy the guardians. She would not get the chance.\n\nIn early [[Eleint]], adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating the Sharrans' activities assaulted the Lost Refuge. Bestra was presumably slain in the fighting, but would attempt to escape under cover of a ''[[blacklight]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Activities": "Overseen by [[Ketsarra Shadowscale]], Bestra was the highest-ranking (albeit only) priest at the Lost Refuge. She was in charge of the defense of the courtyard. Her primary duty, however, was to pose as a priestess of [[Mystra]] and greet and oversee the duped petitioners and finally send them through the Dusk Lord's Passage into the [[Plane of Shadow]] and eventually the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]]. She also commanded the [[ghirrash]] [[Jherremor]] in the Shadow Citadel, but he was a reluctant minion.",
        "Powers": "A cleric of Shar, Bestra commanded the [[Darkness domain|Darkness]] and [[Knowledge domain]]s. She had been initiated into the higher secrets of the [[church of Shar]] and wielded [[Shadow Weave]] [[magic]].",
        "Skills": "She once had cause to learn the [[Giant language]].",
        "Possessions": "Bestra fought in [[full plate armor]] with [[light steel shield]] and [[heavy mace]], all of masterwork quality. Over this, she wore a ''[[cloak of resistance]] +1'' and was equipped with a ''[[wand]] of [[cure light wounds]]'' and a ''[[scroll]] of [[divine power]]''. She used a ''[[disc of secrets]]'' for her unholy symbol of Shar.",
        "Description": "When the adventurers assaulted the Lost Refuge, Bestra was only seen in full plate armor and face-covering helm, so her appearance is unknown."
