        "mainbody": "Bestra Mornscroll was a female Chondathan human cleric of Shar in the early 1370s DR.\nIn the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Bestra Mornscroll was operating at the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp, directing the duped petitioners from the false Temple of Mystra in Wheloon through the Dusk Lords Passage portal to their dooms.\nOnce, on the other side of the Dusk Lords Passage, in the Shadow Citadel, an acolyte was slain by the shadow elemental guardians of the Dusk Lords throne. Bestra ordered that it be left alone until she had time to destroy the guardians. She would not get the chance.\nIn early Eleint, adventurers in service to Mystra investigating the Sharrans activities assaulted the Lost Refuge. Bestra was presumably slain in the fighting, but would attempt to escape under cover of a blacklight spell.\nOverseen by Ketsarra Shadowscale, Bestra was the highest-ranking (albeit only) priest at the Lost Refuge. She was in charge of the defense of the courtyard. Her primary duty, however, was to pose as a priestess of Mystra and greet and oversee the duped petitioners and finally send them through the Dusk Lords Passage into the Plane of Shadow and eventually the Monastery of the Ebon Dome. She also commanded the ghirrash Jherremor in the Shadow Citadel, but he was a reluctant minion.\nA cleric of Shar, Bestra commanded the Darkness and Knowledge domains. She had been initiated into the higher secrets of the church of Shar and wielded Shadow Weave magic.\nShe once had cause to learn the Giant language.\nBestra fought in full plate armor with light steel shield and heavy mace, all of masterwork quality. Over this, she wore a cloak of resistance +1 and was equipped with a wand of cure light wounds and a scroll of divine power. She used a disc of secrets for her unholy symbol of Shar.  \nWhen the adventurers assaulted the Lost Refuge, Bestra was only seen in full plate armor and face-covering helm, so her appearance is unknown."
