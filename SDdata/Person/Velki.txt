==Description==
Like many other Reapers of Bhaal, Velki was wrapped in dark cloth, a mask and a hood hid her facial features, leaving only her brown eyes exposed.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Velki killed and skinned her victims in service of [[Bhaal]], the Lord of Murder and his [[Chosen]] â€“ [[Orin the Red]]. She hold fascination with leather made out of [[humanoid]] skin and especially valued [[drow]] skin, unblemished by sunlight's glare, that was made into magnificent [[leather]]. Thorough servitude to Orin, Reaper of Bhaal Velki supported the [[Cult of the Absolute]] that threatened the city of Baldur's Gate.
