        "mainbody": "'''Lorelei Gravesower''' was a female [[half-elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Kelemvor]] who tended the [[Kelemvor's Garden]] cemetery in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Lorelei became caretaker of the graveyard in the late 1360s DR, and renamed it from the \"Thunderstone Cemetery\".This was likely in [[1368 DR]] after Kelemvor's ascension as god of death.",
        "Activities": "Living out of a small house on the grounds of the cemetery, Lorelei's task was to provide counselling and advice to the grieving and conduct maintenance on the cemetery.",
        "Rumors": "A scurrilous rumor told that a woman dwelling in a hut beside the cemetery (perhaps Lorelei herself) would sell her favors to a man for a night, but this was a lie."
