==Description==
Goldwake was a [[human]] woman with a light skin tone and hazel eyes. She wore a set of heavy [[splint mail]] and a [[helmet]].

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Captain Goldwake frequented the Water Queen's House, uttering prayers to her goddess. She was at the temple shortly after one of its [[priestess]]es, [[Holli Dylford]], drowned whilst swimming in the [[Gray Harbor]]. Goldwake wanted to appease the Bitch Queen before a voyage but found all the priestesses preoccupied with the last rights ceremony for Holli.
