'''Arsekaslyx''' was a [[red dragon]] member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. She was called to the [[Well of Dragons]] to reinforce the defense of the Cult's stronghold there.

==Relationship==
Arsekaslyx enjoyed playing with the Cult's commanders in the Well; she kept her presence secret from [[Naergoth Bladelord]] to avoid a confrontation for power. On the other hand, she tempted [[Vargo Kent]] with the secret of becoming a [[half-dragon]] [[dracolich]].

==History==
In order to retain her sanity during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], she used an artifact called the ''[[bone scepter of Zceryll]]'', known as the "the star-spawn", which protected her from the Rage's effects but also warped her physiology.

She arrived at the Well of Dragons in around 1373 DR and remained there until at least [[1479 DR]].
