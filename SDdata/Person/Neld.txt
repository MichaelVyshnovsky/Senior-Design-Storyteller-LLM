'''Neld''' was a hostler at [[Castle Obarskyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was rightly suspicious.

==Activities==
He was the senior hostler.

==Description==
On the day after his fight with [[Mirt]], he was going to sport two round, swollen black eyes.

==History==
When [[Mirt]] tried to get the hostler to ready a coach for him in the middle of the night after the massacre during the [[Council of the Dragon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlink|1479}}, the senior hostler was reluctant to comply as he spoke like an outlander, demanding a closed coach to a particular place, and named the authority of a high-rank [[War Wizard]] without saying which one. His suspicion led to [[Voruld]], a [[Purple Dragon]] soldier, to intervene; after Mirt took him down, Neld tried to defend himself. He got punched into the floor twice before he stopped trying to get up, and accepted Mirt's commands.

Neld drove Mirt's coach to the [[Three Dolphins Door]] before leaving. Mirt apparently was hitting him all the way.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|254|27}}
