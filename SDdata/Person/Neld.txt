Neld was a hostler at Castle Obarskyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was rightly suspicious.
He was the senior hostler.
On the day after his fight with Mirt, he was going to sport two round, swollen black eyes.
When Mirt tried to get the hostler to ready a coach for him in the middle of the night after the massacre during the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the , the senior hostler was reluctant to comply as he spoke like an outlander, demanding a closed coach to a particular place, and named the authority of a high-rank War Wizard without saying which one. His suspicion led to Voruld, a Purple Dragon soldier, to intervene after Mirt took him down, Neld tried to defend himself. He got punched into the floor twice before he stopped trying to get up, and accepted Mirts commands.
Neld drove Mirts coach to the Three Dolphins Door before leaving. Mirt apparently was hitting him all the way.
