Sulesdeg the Pole was a tall guard working on the Sword Coast just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
Sulesdeg did not talk much, but when he did, people listened.
A native of the Shaar, where in his native language his name meant "tall as a lodge pole", he traveled to the Sword Coast and found work as a guard.
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons in 1489 DR he worked as a guard for a great caravan that, unknown to him, was full of agents of the Cult of the Dragon transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
