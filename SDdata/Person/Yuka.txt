'''Yuka''' was a follower of the [[Faith of the Nine Travelers]] in [[Wa]] in the 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Personality==
He was a young man and zealous, but considered more-or-less harmless.

==Description==
He wore religious vestments of his faith.

==History==
In [[1355 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]], Yuka set up a stall at the base of the Three Thousand Steps before the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] in [[Aru]] and attempted to convert the [[pilgrim]]s away from [[Bishamon]] to the Faith of the Nine Travelers. Calling them "benighted heathens" with a "false belief" didn't help his case. The pilgrims were understandably aggravated by this and some two dozen formed a mob to chase him off, possibly even beating him. How this was resolved would prove to be a sensitive matter in the time shortly before the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps.
