'''Zarifar''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]] from [[Sshamath]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Zarifar was a very talented [[geometer]] with his mind always full of geometric designs. However, in normal life he was totally naive.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] invited him to his new [[College of Ancient Arcana]] and he accepted.

Zarifar, like all his fellows, became one of the masters of the new school by [[1379 DR]], despite the worries of Q'arlynd about his skills as a teacher. Together with his fellows and the Masters [[Urlryn Khalazza]], [[Seldszar Elpragh]], and [[Masoj Dhuunyl]] he helped Q'Arlynd when he engineered (with the aid of [[Eilistraee]]) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood into their original [[dark elves]]. After that, they all relocated to [[Rhymanthiin]].

By [[1480 DR]], Zarifar was working at the library in the [[dwarven]] city of [[Sundasz]]. There, he met [[Torrin Ironstar]] and helped him to understand earth magic.{{Cite digital book/The Gilded Rune/Kindle|2688}}
