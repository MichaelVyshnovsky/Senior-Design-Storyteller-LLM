Zarifar was a drow wizard from Sshamath in the late 14 century DR.
Zarifar was a very talented geometer with his mind always full of geometric designs. However, in normal life he was totally naive.
In the , Qarlynd Melarn invited him to his new College of Ancient Arcana and he accepted.
Zarifar, like all his fellows, became one of the masters of the new school by 1379 DR, despite the worries of Qarlynd about his skills as a teacher. Together with his fellows and the Masters Urlryn Khalazza, Seldszar Elpragh, and Masoj Dhuunyl he helped QArlynd when he engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonais blood into their original dark elves. After that, they all relocated to Rhymanthiin.
By 1480 DR, Zarifar was working at the library in the dwarven city of Sundasz. There, he met Torrin Ironstar and helped him to understand earth magic.
