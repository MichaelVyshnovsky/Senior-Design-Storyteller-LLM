While the black dragon is generally better suited to water and the fang dragon is a creature of arid environments, the creature as described still seems to match the latter more than the first.

'''Scathrys''' was a [[black dragon]]{{cite book/City of Torment|68|7}} or [[fang dragon]], possibly [[pseudonatural]], that lived in [[Gethshemeth]]'s lair in [[Taunissik]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Scathrys had teeth as long as Anusha's forearm. The creature's chin was full of spikes, and its face resembled a skull with deep-set eyes, each lined with two rows of horns.

==Personality==
For whatever reason, Scathrys was unwilling to tangle with incorporeal creatures, and seemed to derive a strange mirth from taunting and lying.

==Abilities==
Scathrys was capable of perceiving, however incompletely, incorporeal creatures, with sufficient accuracy to dodge some of their attacks. Per [[Raidon Kane]], who was wielding ''[[Angul]]'' at the time, the dragon bore a certain taint that he couldn't abide, suggesting some sort of aberration taint. Its breath weapon was a line of acid, and it could induce terror with a roar.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1396}}, Scathrys dwelled in Gethshemeth's lair. It participated in the ambush set for [[Seren Juramot]], [[Nogah]], [[Japheth Donard]] and [[Thoster]], breathing acid at them from concealment and then frightening them with a roar.

When [[Raidon Kane]] entered the lair, the dragon almost pounced on him, but stopped as it noticed the invisible presence of [[Anusha Marhana]]'s dreamform, who demanded to know of the fate of those who had entered the lair before, referring to [[Japheth]], Thoster, and [[Seren Juramot]]. Rather than attack, it decided to taunt the intruders and urge them on their way to the [[kraken]], claiming that the comrades Anusha wanted to rescue were vowing fealty to it.
