Kerrilla Gemstar was a female shield dwarf and a cleric of Marthammor Duin, the Finder-of-Trails, from Deadsnows in the Silver Marches.
Around 1370 DR, she was a member of the Council of 12 Peers,
Kerrilla was a close colleague of Morninglord Ashnar. They spoke often on matters important to the community, and their advice and assistance were much sought after by Deadsnows locals.
In the Year of the Wild Magic, 1372 DR, a dead dwarven prospector named Bromgart found on the road was brought back to Hospice. Before the priests buried him, Kerrilla used a speak with dead and learned that Bromgart had encountered a "beast of blackness" and "dark
clerics" in the Ironhand Mines.
She was still at her post sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
