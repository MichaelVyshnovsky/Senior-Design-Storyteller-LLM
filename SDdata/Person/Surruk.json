        "mainbody": "Surruk was an wild elven woodsman in Phlan during the Tyranny of Dragons.\nWhen adventuring, Surruk wore dirty leather armor and fought with a purple-hued Morcant Burl longbow. To protect herself from harm, Surruk usually kept a healing potion in her backpack.\nThe elf was not forthcoming and preferred the wilds of the Moonsea to speaking with others.\nIn 1489 DR, Surruk patrolled the Quivering Forest hunting fey creatures. Later, she went to the Madame Freonas Tea Kettle and was briefly interrogated by adventurers hired by Buhrell Caah about a missing dangerous magic item."
