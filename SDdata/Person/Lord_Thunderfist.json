The little rogue ended with the nobles purse in his possession but was caught by the angry lord. Thunderfist threatened Purfbin with hanging even though the gnome tried to convince the noble his purse simply fell on him. Lord Thunderfist was not convinced, but the gnome managed to escape and hopped onto a merchant caravan heading to Daggerford, escaping the law."
