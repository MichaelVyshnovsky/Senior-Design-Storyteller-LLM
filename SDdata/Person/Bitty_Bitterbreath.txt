'''Bitty Bitterbreath''' was the Chief Cook who lived in [[Purfbin Doogrick]]'s home burrow in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Bitty Bitterbreath was in charge of the burrow's annual [[New Harvest Festival]] and its famous [[Harvest Stew]] and [[New Harvest Punch]]. One year, the ambitious young tinkerer Purfbin Doogrick persuaded the woman to publicly test out his new grand inventionâ€”the [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]]. The machine was created to peel a mountain of [[potato]]es that later were to go into the Harvest Stew. Something went awry, and the New Harvest Festival turned into a scene of carnage. Shred-o-Matic 1000 lost control, and gnomish screams could be heard for several miles. Fortunately, Purfbin Doogrick's reputation, [[Dame Edza]]'s prized wig, and [[Mayor Whimblesnort]]'s [[silk]] hat were the only fatalities.
