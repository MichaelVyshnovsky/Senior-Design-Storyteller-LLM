Lysalis was a female feyri wizard in service to Kaanyr Vhok, the leader of the Scoured Legion at the time of the Legions assault on Sundabar.
During the attack in 1385 DR, Lysalis helped Vhok to enter unseen into the town but was later killed fighting some dwarven guards. She was secretly replaced by a half-dragon named Myshik Morueme.
