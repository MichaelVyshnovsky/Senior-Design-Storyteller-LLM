        "mainbody": "Beromchess Ilthyn was a priestess of Ilmater in the 13th century DR.\nBeromchess lived locally to the elderly sage Athorton of Nleeth, and became friends with him. It was later theorized that it was Athorton whod stolen the Tome of Torment—the holiest book of the faith of Ilmater—from the priestess of Loviatar, Lalaskra of Ormpetarr. This was because, when Athorton died in the Year of the Shattered Altar, 1264 DR, Beromchess came into possession of the Tome. She covertly took the Tome to the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum, a major temple of Ilmater at the time.\nCategoryPriests and priestesses\nCategoryWorshipers of Ilmater\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vilhon Reach\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nts63cxlfa3a0dbz5teb4j47rx0enq4h"
