Arthagus (Pronounce|are|THAY|gus|refs=
In 1358 DR, Arthagus was an elderly man with a white beard and green eyes.
By 1373 DR, Arthagus was a thin and trembling man.
Arthagus was a kind man, but he had been betrayed and threatened enough times that he firmly believed that lies and deception were necessary to survive life in Faer√ªn.
Arthagus was a skilled illusionist and spent most of his time quietly in his Yhaunn home, refining his skill with the Art of illusion magic, and only occasionally tutoring young spellcasters interested in illusions. He was known to aid the rulers of Sembia by spreading false rumors that affected public opinion inside Sembia, or the impressions of foreign powers. This gained him quite a few friends on the Merchants Council.
Arthagus owned many protective magic items including an onyx dog.
In 1373 DR, Arthagus briefly met the Moonmistress-Designate of Moonshadow Hall Feena Archwood at a high-society party hosted by Ammanas Aumleagarr.
