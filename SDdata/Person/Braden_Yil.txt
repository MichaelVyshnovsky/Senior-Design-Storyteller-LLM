'''Braden Yil''' was a merchant retainer of [[House Cadorna]] of [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
Braden was a nervous but meticulous individual. He looked frequently at the sky in order to check his adherence to his time schedule. He spoke curtly and briefly and got exasperated when subjected to long speeches.

==History==
Braden worked as merchant for House Cadorna. In 1489 DR, after a dramatic increase of bandit attacks around the [[Iron Route]], he hired an adventuring party to solve the matter.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|6}}
