Namshita was a Mulani warrior and the leader of the rebel Untherans who opposed Gilgeam in the last years of the 15th century DR.
Namshita was a taller woman with bronze skin and cropped black hair. She wore a copper-and-leather breastplate with jackal-shaped shoulders.
Namshita was born on the world of Abeir, on the lands of Shyr. At the age of five, she was sold to a Shyran genasi to work as a slave in a wheat field, and was trained as a warrior since an early age. When she reached adulthood, she was promoted to be the guard of the granary, and her job was to punish other Mulani who displeased the genasi. Gilgeam freed her and her people and gave them the chance to join his rebellion.
However, as time passed, Namshita came to the conclusion that Gilgeam was a madman. Her contempt for him increased when Gilgeam struck a bargain with the demon lord Grazzt for a demon army to bolster his forces.
The next day, Namshita found Dahl Peredur, his brothers, and Mira Zawad near the Untheran encampment and captured them. They were helped by a group of dream giants, and later joined forces with Mehen, Uadjit, and other Thymari dragonborn. 
When Gilgeam sent Utu and Zillah to steal Nanna-Sins divine spark, Namshita helped Mehen and Dumuzi to stop them, thwarting Gilgeams plan to become a true god.
After Yrjixtilex Kallan was elected as the new Vanquisher, Namshita asked for political asylum for her and her forces in exchange for intelligence about the Untheran forces. Namshitas forces also took part in the final battle of the First Tymanther-Unther War, aiding the dragonborn in the defense of Djerad Thymar. After the war ended, Namshita and her rebel forces became Thymari citizens and Vanquisher Kallan allowed them to form their own clan, giving them full rights in Thymari society.
