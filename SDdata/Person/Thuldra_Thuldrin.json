Thuldra Thuldrin found her way to the Rivington district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, she was refused entrance. Being a kind soul, Thuldra worked with the Flaming Fist to feed the refugees in the camp, and asked Father Lorgan of the Open Hand Temple for carrots, apples, or anything they could spare for the starving refugees."
