Sister Farielle was a Waukeenar priestess who ran the House of Waukeen in Saradush during the mid–14 century DR.
Farielle was quite compassionate and was willing to help those in need whenever she was able.
She had a romantic relationship with Pyrgam Aleson, the owner of the Tankard Tree tavern.
When Saradush was under siege during the Bhaalspawn crisis of 1369 DR, Sister Farielle did all she could to assist the Bhaalspawn refugees looking for shelter.
