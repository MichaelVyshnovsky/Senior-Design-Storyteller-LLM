Verrin was a thug in Suzail, Cormyr, who worked for Marlin Stormserpent in the late 15 century DR.
Verrin was an accomplice in many of Marlin Stormserpents dirty deeds.
In Mirtul of the , the treasonous nobleman Marlin Stormserpent stole the Wyverntongue Chalice from Castle Obarskyr in Suzail. He used an exit passage leading into the basements beneath the Old Dwarf, a nearby tavern, where the gate was to be unlocked by his accomplice, Verrin. However, he found Verrin was working with Marlazander and had left the gate locked.
Marlin then unleashed his stirge, Thirsty, which quickly stabbed Verrin in the neck, leaving a mortal wound. Marlazander, in turn, fled, only to be slain by an undead warrior, Targrael.
