Waleed ibn-Keram was a gnome tax collector who worked at the Gate of the Ghost in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Waleed had an impeccable eye for spotting smugglers. Her slight stature made her a natural fit for testing wagons for false bottoms.
Smuggling was Waleeds trade for more than a decade in her youth. When caught, she was given a chance to redeem her name and pay her debt to society by helping catch other smugglers.
