'''Waleed ibn-Keram''' was a [[gnome]] tax collector who worked at the [[Gate of the Ghost]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Waleed had an impeccable eye for spotting [[smuggler]]s. Her slight stature made her a natural fit for testing [[wagon]]s for false bottoms.

==History==
Smuggling was Waleed's trade for more than a decade in her youth. When caught, she was given a chance to redeem her name and pay her debt to society by helping catch other smugglers.
