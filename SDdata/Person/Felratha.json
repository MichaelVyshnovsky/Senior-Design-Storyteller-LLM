She played her lute every time things grew dull.\nFelratha lead a minstrel band, Felrathas Merry Minstrels.\nCirca 1486 DR, Felratha met the drow Arrizz, who was on the surface to search for goods for the refugees from Szith Morcane. Felratha agreed to help him, thanks to her contacts. Together, they gained a shipment of supplies from the Zhentarim and planned to deliver them using the Waydown. For this, they hired an adventuring party to escort them.\nThe plan was to use the minstrel band as cover in order to pass the Red Plumes garrison inside the Waydown without suspicion. She was also working with the Order of the Gauntlet to expose Commander Maggarl Helcks illicit activities.\nFelratha had good connections with the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords Alliance, and even the Zhentarim."
