'''Unstrarr Troon''' was a veteran member of the [[Purple Dragons]] in [[Suzail]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was young.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], Hethel and four more Dragons acted as escorts for the [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] [[Ellard Gauntur]] in his pursuit of the renegade [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]]. Following Ellard Gauntur's impressions, they went to a portal to the [[King's Tower]] in [[Marsember]] first, where they found a woman; from a stain in her clothes, Ellard Gauntur quickly figured out it was Rorskryn transformed, but not until she'd already crossed. The group followed through the portal, except for Unstrarr Troon, who stepped back briefly to inform [[Corleth Fentable]]. Then the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] sent the [[death knight]] [[Targrael]] after them to hide Mreldrake's trail.

Targrael found Unstrarr Troon running up the stairs after his delay, and caught up with him in a landing, slaying him very quickly.
