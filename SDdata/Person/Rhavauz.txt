Rhavauz was a female drow guard officer in Szith Morcane who fled from Maerimydra after the invasion of Kurgoth Hellspawn.
During her duties as an officer of Szith Morcane, Rhavauz wore a tabard over her breastplate with the emblem of House Tsarran on it, a leering black skull upon a white background.
Rhavauz had great disdain for the worshipers of Lolth, which only deepened during the Silence of Lolth. Despite this, she held at least some semblance of hope for those of her own family, that they might join her in the worship of Kiaransalee.
Specializing in the use of a two-bladed sword, Rhavauz was a highly mobile fighter who could spring in and out of combat as needed.
As an officer in Szith Morane, Rhavauz had access to a nice array of magical items but she customarily kept both a magical two-bladed sword and breastplate with her at all times and would wear a pair of slippers of spider climbing on her feet.
Rhavauz had a close relationship with Indrizil, a family member who resided under Cormanthor.
Before the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, Rhavauz lived in Maerimydra as a follower of Irae Tsarran and was involved in the slaughter of the Lolthites during the Silence. During the invasion of Maerimydra by the forces of Kurgoth Hellspawn on Eleint 23 of 1372 DR, Rhavauz worked with others of the city to defeat the fire giant and goblinoid invaders. When House Chumavh eventually fell, she fled to Szith Morcane and became a guard officer in Dorina Tsarrans new regime.
By Marpenoth of 1372 DR, Rhavauz had decided to get in touch with her family in Cormanthor and composed a letter to Indrizil hoping it might bring her more allies in Szith Morcane.
