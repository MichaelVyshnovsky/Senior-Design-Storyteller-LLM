        "mainbody": "'''Kardann''' was an official of the government of [[Amn]] in [[1361 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1361 DR, Kardann was assigned to the [[Golden Legion]] for their [[Maztica]]n expedition. He was tasked with safeguarding Amnian interests during the journey.\n \nSoon after the battle near [[Payit]], he conspired with some legionaries to return to [[Faerûn]] in order to secure the first partition of [[gold]]. In order to stop Kardann's plot and avoid more complications, [[Cordell]] decided to burn the ships.\n \nKardann was disliked by most of the legionaries.\n\nHis only other action of note occurred during the Legion's stop in [[Nexal]], when he found the lost gold treasure of [[Axalt]].\n\nHe quickly betrayed Cordell to side with [[Don Vaez]], saying that it was the best interests of Amn, but in truth for the promise to sail back to [[Faerûn]]. \nWhen Cordell regained control of [[Helmsport]] Kardann escaped alone in the jungle.\nAt last while in the jungle he met a very hungry [[jaguar lord]] in search of food."
