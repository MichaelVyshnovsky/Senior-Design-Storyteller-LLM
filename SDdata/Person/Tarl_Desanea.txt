'''Tarl Desanea''' was a blind, retired adventurer who lived in the city of [[Phlan]] with his wife [[Shal Desanea]].

==History==
Tarl was a [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]] from [[Vaasa]] who began his training in his order when he and his fellow brethren were tasked with transporting the [[Hammer of Tyr]]. During a battle with [[undead]], Tarl instinctively called the Hammer of Tyr to his hand while battling [[vampire]]s. Although he was forced to give the hammer over to the Master Vampire to save his friends, Tarl would later adventure with [[Ren o' the Blade]] and [[Shal Bal]] to retrieve the holy relic, which was being subverted by the Master Vampire's evil. Soon afterwards, he married Shal.

Ten years later, Tarl was among the defenders of Phlan when [[Bane]] transported the city to an underground cavern in order to subvert it. With Shal, Ren, and those accompanying Ren at the time, Tarl destroyed the [[Pool of Darkness]] empowering Phlan's captors by throwing the Hammer of Tyr into the pool. However, due to Bane's machinations, Tarl was unable to reclaim the artifact. It was during this that Tarl's son was born.

Tarl was blinded when he took an almost fatal blow during the defense of the [[Death Gates]] in Phlan. However, he gained the ability to see magical emanations and creatures of shadow, and used this ability to defend his temple. While his son was questing for the Hammer of Tyr, Tarl managed to subdue his self-pity in order to defend Phlan once again.

==Description==
He was a handsome, middle-aged with silver-white hair. His gentle blue eyes stared blindly from their sockets.
