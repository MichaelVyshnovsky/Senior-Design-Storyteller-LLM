'''Calico Grimm''' was a sea captain in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Calico was the captain of the swift ship ''[[Joen's Heirloom]]'' with [[Bonnie Charlee]] as first mate.

==History==
In [[1488 DR]], the ''Joen's Heirloom'' was designated as the flagship of the Luskan navy under [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in the fight against the fleet of [[Brevindon Margaster]].

Calico discussed with Bonnie, [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], and [[Wulfgar]] how to better fight the [[Margaster]] fleet.

During the battle the Heirloom was sunk and Calico was presumed dead.

For truth he was sliched in half by [[Asbeel]].
