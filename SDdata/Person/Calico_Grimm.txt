Calico Grimm was a sea captain in the late 15 century DR.
Calico was the captain of the swift ship Joens Heirloom with Bonnie Charlee as first mate.
In 1488 DR, the Joens Heirloom was designated as the flagship of the Luskan navy under Bregan Daerthe in the fight against the fleet of Brevindon Margaster.
Calico discussed with Bonnie, Kimmuriel Oblodra, and Wulfgar how to better fight the Margaster fleet.
During the battle the Heirloom was sunk and Calico was presumed dead.
For truth he was sliched in half by Asbeel.
