'''Laurlaethee Shaurlangar''' was an [[elf]] of [[Myth Drannor]] who failed to kill [[Elminster Aumar]]{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}}

==Appearance==
She was very frail-looking, slender as a wisp, and maybe half Elminster Aumar's height, though she had perfect lips. She wore a gown during her meeting with Elminster Aumar; after her meeting, she became both younger and taller by the power of [[Mystra]], and doffed the gown on her own power.

==Abilities==
Laurlaethee could cast a number of spells, up to and including ''[[blood dragon]]''.

==Relationships==
Laurlaethee had been the lover of [[Touor]], and considered the [[Starym]] to be overproud fools.

==History==
On [[Kythorn 4]] of {{yearlink|261}}, Laurlaethee Shaurglangar got into a meeting with Elminster Aumar, where she poisoned him with [[srindym]] in the [[moonwine]] she served him. When he survived, she tried to slay him with spells, slowly realizing that he really was protected by Mystra. Her last attempt at slaying him involved a ''blood dragon'' spell, but Elminster reversed the spell, preventing her death. She was then rejuvenated by Mystra.
