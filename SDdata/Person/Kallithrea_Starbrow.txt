'''Kallithrea Starbrow''' was one of the daughters of the [[Roadwarden]] of the [[Roadwarden Guard]], [[Arelin Starbrow]], active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kallithrea was an insecure young woman who chose the profession of a [[cleric]]. She had long curly brown hair.

==Relationships==
Kallithrea was a daughter to Arelin Starbrow and [[Morudel]] of [[Marsember]]. Her siblings were troublemaker [[Dazmilar]], heroic [[Vidruand]], and bloodthirsty [[Yemandra]].

==Possessions==
In the rare cations when Kallithrea took to violence, she wielded an [[enchanted]] ''+3'' [[mace]] and wore a ''+3'' magical [[banded mail]], as well as a [[shield]] and a [[helmet]] of the same enchantment. She had a ''[[ring of protection]]'' adorning her finger under a set of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]''.

==History==
In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], age 30, Kallithrea Starbrow was one of the members of the [[Sunite]] clergy in the [[Skull Crag Keep]]'s Chapel of Lady Firehair. After Kallithrea's mother perished in a devious monster attack, the priestly daughter was considered for the position of the Roadwarden. Kallithrea did not think she was fit to be the steward of the keep as the youth felt she liked a steeled heart of a [[warrior]]. However, she also thought her siblings did not possess the required strength of character to take on the job. With Arelin Starbrow's death, the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' were lost and scattered by the monster horde. Kallithrea was tasked with the recovery of the ''[[Shield]] of the Roadwarden.'' She was aided in the task by a group of caravan guards who recently saved [[Sir Dutiocs]]s life. Not being an adventuring type, Kallithrea sent her companion [[half-elf]] [[Arderiel]] in her stead.

When Morudel, Kallithrea's father, was kidnapped by the villainous [[vampire]] [[Keremish]] and help hostage in a [[hin]] village across the [[Tunlands]], Yemandra was furious. The [[undead]] demanded the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' in exchange for Morudel's life, yet Yemandra was adamant that the magic set was to remain within the Skull Crag Keep and the Roadwarden Guard need to prepare an assault to avenge Morudel. While Kallithrea called for the siblings to give up the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' to save what was left of their family.
