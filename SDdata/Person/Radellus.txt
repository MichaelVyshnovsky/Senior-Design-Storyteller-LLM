'''Radellus''' was a mage at some point before the turn of the 9{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
By the end of his life, Radellus had wearied of Amn's intrigues.

==History==
At some point before the turn of the 9{{th}} century, Radellus decided to retire to a tower east of [[Sreve]], and slew the previous owner, [[Justal Iroon]], for it. During the battle, a local young boy of the village, [[Kurtal]], snuck in and made out with three of [[Justal Iroon]]'s spellbooks, which he then used for practice. Radellus flung Justal Iroon's smoking body the length of Sreve's main street; it was then whisked into the millpond, killing all its fish.

At some point afterwards, but still prior to the year {{yearlink|797}}, the same young boy, now an experienced mage, came and blasted him to ashes.
