Barthus was a [[vampire]] [[priest]] of [[Bane]] that somewhere after the [[Spellplague]] established himself in the catacombs under the ruins of [[Spellgard]]. Using his divine powers, he cowed several [[undead]] already there into his service and created more from captured victims.

=== Appearance ===

He had a long white beard and cold black eyes. He wore a suit of blackened leather armor, carried a holy symbol of [[Bane]] hanging from his neck, and he always had in his hand his [[lifedrinker]] mace.
