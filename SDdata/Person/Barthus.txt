Barthus was a vampire priest of Bane that somewhere after the Spellplague established himself in the catacombs under the ruins of Spellgard. Using his divine powers, he cowed several undead already there into his service and created more from captured victims.
He had a long white beard and cold black eyes. He wore a suit of blackened leather armor, carried a holy symbol of Bane hanging from his neck, and he always had in his hand his lifedrinker mace.
