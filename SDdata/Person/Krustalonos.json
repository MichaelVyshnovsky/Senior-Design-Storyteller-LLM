        "mainbody": "rustalonos was a very old crystal dragon of the North who was a companion of the archmage Tulrun of the Tent.\nIn the 7 century DR, Tulrun and Krustalonos often explored the ruins and former lands of Netheril together. They shared an insatiable wanderlust and came from the same area of the North. They lost touch, however, when Tulrun went off alone and discovered the Abbey of the Moon, and left the material plane altogether.\nKrustalonos was later slain, seemingly by Sneighfanglen, a great wyrm white dragon known as the Spawn of Auril who kept his skeleton within her lair.\nIn the , the returned Tulrun went looking for his old companion, and found his bones instead. Now looking for revenge, Tulrun spent the better half of a year hunting down and killing Sneighfanglen, her mate, and her clutch. Finally, on Nightal 30, he finally avenged Krustalonos when he slew Sneighfanglen herself. Only one hatchling escapedâ€”Arauthator, who would grow up and begin his own quest for revenge against Tulrun."
