        "mainbody": "'''Krustalonos''' was a [[Dragon aging|very old]] [[crystal dragon]] of [[the North]] who was a companion of the [[archmage]] [[Tulrun|Tulrun of the Tent]].{{Cite polyhedron/125/Wayward Wizards: Tulrun of the Tent|24}}{{Cite web enhancement/Roll Call of Dragons}}",
        "History": "In the 7{{th}} century [[DR]], Tulrun and Krustalonos often explored the ruins and former lands of [[Netheril]] together. They shared an insatiable wanderlust and came from the same area of the North. They lost touch, however, when Tulrun went off alone and discovered the [[Abbey of the Moon]], and left the material plane altogether.\n\nKrustalonos was later slain, seemingly by [[Sneighfanglen]], a great wyrm [[white dragon]] known as the Spawn of [[Auril]] who kept his skeleton within her lair.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|940}}, the returned Tulrun went looking for his old companion, and found his bones instead. Now looking for revenge, Tulrun spent the better half of a year hunting down and killing Sneighfanglen, her mate, and her clutch. Finally, on [[Nightal 30]], he finally avenged Krustalonos when he slew Sneighfanglen herself. Only one hatchling escaped—[[Arauthator]], who would grow up and begin his own quest for revenge against Tulrun."
