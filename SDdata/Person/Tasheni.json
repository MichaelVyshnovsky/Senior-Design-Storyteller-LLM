        "mainbody": "'''Tasheni''' was a [[vampire]] crime lord in [[Westgate]] around [[1374 DR]].",
        "History": "In life, Tasheni was the lover of the [[paladin]] [[Mantides]] and decided to investigate the [[Night Masks]]. However, she was captured by the Night Masks leader [[Orbakh]], who turned her into one of his [[vampire spawn]]. Somehow, Tasheni regained her free will and started to plan a coup against Orbakh. Thanks to the help of the [[sorceress]] [[Zymena]], she created the [[Ebon Claws]] crime organization, mostly composed by [[wererat]]s and publicly led by [[Altama]].\n\nThe Ebon Claws started a war with the Night Masks and Tasheni waited for the right time to act.\n\nAround 1374 DR, Altama helped an adventurer in their fight with the Night Masks. At last, thanks to the adventurer and to Tasheni's alliance with the [[Fire Knives]], Orbakh seemed defeated. The adventurer managed to unveil Tasheni and defeated her also."
