        "History": "In [[1489 DR]],\n\nIn 1492 DR, Victoro and his wife planned to recover the lost [[gold]] of [[Dagult Neverember]] and use it to buy back the souls of their children. Victoro focused on searching for the gold while Ammalia was busy with other preparations for the ceremony to save the souls of their children.",
        "Personality": "Osvaldo had become totally insane and hated his parents but the truth was that the soulless body of Osvaldo now housed a [[chain devil]].",
        "Activities": "Osvaldo was chained and locked in the attic of [[Cassalanter Villa]] where he was held in place by a magical pentagram and guarded by two [[imp]]s working for Victoro. He desperately tried to free himself by asking for someone to rescue him. Ammalia often wept at her transformed son's feet in the mansion's attic. To everyone but his parents, Osvaldo was studying in a faraway city."
