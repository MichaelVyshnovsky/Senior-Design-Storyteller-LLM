'''Drusilla''' was a young woman in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 1350s [[DR]].

One night in a tavern in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], she and a friend flattered and flirted with the [[dwarf]] adventurer [[Onyx the Invincible]]. However, this was a distraction so [[Kyriani|an old woman]] could get his autograph—on a marriage contract.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|2}}
