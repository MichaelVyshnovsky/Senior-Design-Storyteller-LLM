        "mainbody": "culus the Inflamed was a unique plaguechanged beholder-like creature that plagued the depths of The Chasm in Neverwinter, during the Spellplague years.\nOculus was an azure floating orb with a single large eye in the middle. Crystalline spikes engulfed in blue flames protruded from the creatures top, and lifeless tendrils hung limply from its sides.\nAfter the Spellplague led to the disastrous eruption of Mount Hotenow in the , the very foundation of Neverwinter collapsed into a massive subterranean canyon known as the Chasm. It became home to all sorts of aberrant and plaguechanged monsters that threatened what was left of the city. Oculuss presence became known to the Neverwintan adventurers when dark, maddening visions began clouding the minds of those who came to the creatures vicinity in The Jagged Approach of the Chasm.\nWith the advent of the Second Sundering and the Chasm being sealed for good, Oculus the Inflamed moved its lair to the environs of Neverwinter, still retaining its plaguechanged abilities."
