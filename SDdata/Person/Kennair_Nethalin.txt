Kennair Nethalin was a firebrand of an adventurer who lived in Beregost during the midâ€“14 century DR. While he was raised to be a farmer, like his father Marl before him, Kennair had a passion for helping others and making the Sword Coast a safer place to live.
Kennair was inspired to take up the venturing life when a group of adventurers traveled through Beregost.
In the , Kennair cleared out some kobolds near the hamlet of Ulgoths Beard. With the gold he earned, Kennair bought his father a new plow.
Sometime in the year that followed, Kennair lost his life while traveling beyond Beregost. His father deeply mourned his death and wound up spending much of his time drinking at Feldeposts Inn.
