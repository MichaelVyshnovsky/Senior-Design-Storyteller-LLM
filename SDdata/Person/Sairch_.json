        "Activities": "In [[1478 DR]] Invadiah was demoted to [[succubi]] in part due to the machinations of Lorcan and his protege  [[Farideh]].\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], she was summoned by Farideh in search of more protection and they made a deal that Farideh had to perform some missions for Sairché in exchange.\n\nSairché put Farideh and her friends into a deep sleep until [[1486 DR]] when she needed their work. She instructed Farideh to secretely penetrate a [[Netheril]] camp on the [[Lost Peaks]]. With her new powers she individuated the [[Chosen]] prisoners.  Sairché wanted to offer the divine sparks of the Chosen to [[Glasya]] or [[Asmodeus]], hoping to increase her position. However, many factions, some of them fiendish, sabotaged each other and ultimately the victors were the [[Harpers]] when they freed all the Chosen. This angered the infernal patrons of Sairché in the [[Nine Hells]].."
