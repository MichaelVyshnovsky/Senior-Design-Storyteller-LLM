He was a broad-shouldered, charismatic, and willful individual, like many successful politicians tended to be.\nBy the , Lord Herengar has been on the throne of Turmish for more than nine years. Before winning his first election for the title of the Lord of Turmish, Herengar was in control of a large contingent of mercenaries called the Call of Arms. The company reached fame and respect all across the Vilhon Reach, working only for the highest-paying customers. After taking the throne, Herengar remained the companys official leader however, that position was symbolic only, and he withdrew from an active role with the Call of Arms.\nIn every single election in Turmish, Herengar was reelected by the nations Assembly of Stars. Some outsiders thought the electoral system to be most unorthodox.\nIn the , Baron Aldorn Thuragar of Sespech plotted to marry his daughter Glisena Foesmasher out to Lord Herengars son in order to forge a political alliance with Turmish. Glisena was appalled at the idea of marrying a man who was as stupid as he was ugly."
