        "mainbody": "'''Herengar''' was the Lord of [[Turmish]] who rose to power in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "When [[Adamar Session]], [[Bard]] of [[Starmantle]], met Lord Herengar during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Reach, the ruler of Turmish was a tall and pleasant man in his 30s. He was a broad-shouldered, charismatic, and willful individual, like many successful politicians tended to be.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Lord Herengar has been on the throne of Turmish for more than nine years. Before winning his first election for the title of the Lord of Turmish, Herengar was in control of a large contingent of mercenaries called the [[Call of Arms]]. The company reached fame and respect all across the [[Vilhon Reach]], working only for the highest-paying customers. After taking the throne, Herengar remained the company's official leader; however, that position was symbolic only, and he withdrew from an active role with the Call of Arms.\n\nIn every single election in Turmish, Herengar was reelected by the nation's [[Assembly of Stars]]. Some outsiders thought the electoral system to be most unorthodox.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Baron [[Aldorn Thuragar]] of [[Sespech]] plotted to marry his daughter [[Glisena Foesmasher]] out to Lord Herengar's son in order to forge a political alliance with Turmish. Glisena was appalled at the idea of marrying a man who was as stupid as he was ugly."
