        "mainbody": "ulnajriem was a stone giant artist and noted recluse from the Heartcoil Deeps who was active in the 15 century DR. \nHe carried with him large, intricately carved stones that he hurled at enemies in battle. \nIn the late 15 century DR, Kulnajriem left his home in the Heartcoil Deeps to travel the surface when his people were displaced by mind flayers led by Qholillaroon. \nWhen adventurers reported the highly unusual sighting of him on Harvestshield Mountain, it alerted the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand, that something must have been amiss in the Heartcoil Deeps. Although Kulnajriem fought with the adventurers, they parted without killing each other, and he left behind several of his throwing stones carved with messages of warning for the surface world. \nVideo Games\nWarriors of Waterdeep\nCategoryStone giants\nCategoryInhabitants of Heartcoil Deeps\nCategoryInhabitants of the Northdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Underdark\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sword Coast North\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryArtists (in-universe)\ne4leb9i778ueedalrbp505eyj6whsqf"
