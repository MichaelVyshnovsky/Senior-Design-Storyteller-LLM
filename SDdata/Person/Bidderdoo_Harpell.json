        "History": "For seven years, Bidderdoo was trapped in the form of a dog due to a backfired spell., he had defensive animal urges that eventually took over, turning him into a silver [[werewolf]]. Upon his first true transformation into a werewolf, he killed [[Uthegental Armgo]], saving [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] and the remaining forces of the [[Gutbuster Brigade]].",
        "Bidderdoos": "Bidderdoo's \"legacy\" was a number of werewolves that lived around the town of Longsaddle by [[1479 DR]], unintentionally scaring the townsfolk but in fact guarding the town. These werewolves were known as \"the Bidderdoos.\" Whether they are descendants of Bidderdoo by blood or by curse was unknown."
