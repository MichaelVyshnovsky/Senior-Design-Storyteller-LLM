        "mainbody": "ek the Tall was the boss of the Rustbone goblin tribe in Undermountain in the late 15 century DR.\nYek ruled a large goblin tribe that settled in the Arcane Chambers of Undermountain, where they opened a bazaar that opposed the goals of the Xanathar Guild for the level.\nIn , Yek found a magic gold circlet, a circlet of human perfection, that turned him into a human. Around the same time, the Rustbone Tribe captured the dwarf adventurer Copper Stormforge.\nYek liked his new body, especially because he was taller than before, despite the criticism of many of his subjects. He was very vain.\nYek had some paid bugbears as guards. Some of his goblin subjects were quietly seeking a means to reverse their boss to his goblin body."
