{{quote|''Well, good adventurers''<br/>''You are off as well you see''<br/>''Though luck favors the winners,''<br/>''You would do well to listen to me.''<br/><br/>''These fortunes may bewitch you''<br/>''They may tarnish your own soul''<br/>''But heed them all I wish you to''<br/>''Or lose your blood in a bowl''|Madame Delores}}

==Description==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], Delores was a beautiful young woman with long, curly black hair and piercing green eyes. She wore an expensive loose red dress and a number of earrings, [[ring]]s, bracelets, and bangles.

==Abilities==
Madame Delores was a musician and a talented performer. She was also knowledgeable in [[potion]]making, [[scroll]] scribing, and crafting of [[enchanted]] items. As a bard, she had access to a number of [[spell]]s, such as ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[identify]]'', and ''[[summon monster I]]'', among others.

==Possessions==
She carried a magic ''+3'' [[dagger]] and wore ''[[bracers of armor]]'' and a ''[[ring of free action]]''.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Madame Delores could be found in Ravens Bluff, offering soothsayings and palm reading to friendly adventurers. Those who were facing dangers received palm reading with cryptic advice as well as blessings of [[Tymora]] at no expense, but those who shunned the young woman received angry retorts. Madame Delores would call herself the famous [[Madame Coth]] and pretend to place a ''[[curse]]'' on the rude adventurers.
