Madame Delores was a gypsy bard and soothsayer from the city of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
Circa 1370 DR, Delores was a beautiful young woman with long, curly black hair and piercing green eyes. She wore an expensive loose red dress and a number of earrings, rings, bracelets, and bangles.
Madame Delores was a musician and a talented performer. She was also knowledgeable in potionmaking, scroll scribing, and crafting of enchanted items. As a bard, she had access to a number of spells, such as enthrall, invisibility, suggestion, charm person, identify, and summon monster I, among others.
She carried a magic +3 dagger and wore bracers of armor and a ring of free action.
In the late 14 century DR, Madame Delores could be found in Ravens Bluff, offering soothsayings and palm reading to friendly adventurers. Those who were facing dangers received palm reading with cryptic advice as well as blessings of Tymora at no expense, but those who shunned the young woman received angry retorts. Madame Delores would call herself the famous Madame Coth and pretend to place a curse on the rude adventurers.
