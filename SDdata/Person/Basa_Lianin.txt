Basa Lianin was a noblewoman, patrician illusionist, a landowner, and a merchant from Bral in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Basa carried an enchanted +3 dagger and protected herself with bracers of defense and a ring of shocking grasp. She also carried a potion of flying.
Basa was born into an old Bral family established by a pirate captain. Despite the family history, she was a honest woman who venerated good. Basa made a living by running a humble merchant company that traded in silks, spices, and exotic woods. She also owned land of the Rock of Bral.
