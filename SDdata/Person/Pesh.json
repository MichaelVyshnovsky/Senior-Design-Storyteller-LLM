        "mainbody": "'''Pesh''' was a [[Bedine]] nomad who traveled across the deserts of [[Anauroch]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Pesh believed that the adventurous life was the best well-lived. He was eager to learn more about the greater world and was always welcoming to any adventurers he encountered.\n\nHe was a kind and trusting individual, if not a little naive and reckless. Despite his naivete, Pesh was quite knowledgeable about how to survive in the harsh desert climate.",
        "Relationships": "His best friend was his grandfather [[Shamir]], a more practical and discerning individual. Together they had a trusty [[camel]] named [[Old Stink]].",
        "History": "Some time during the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Pesh and Shamir found the inert [[Sapphire Sentinel]], an ancient [[stone golem]] half-buried in the sands of the desert. Shortly after its discovery, a group of wandering adventurers came across the boy and his grandfather. The Sapphire Sentinel \"awoke\" while in the group's presence, awing Pesh and sparking his yearn for adventure."
