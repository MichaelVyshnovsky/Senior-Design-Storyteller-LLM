        "mainbody": "The man known as \"'''Rosey'''\" was a sergeant, or [[Alzhedo dictionary#M|''musar'']] in the army of the [[bakkal]] of [[Cursrah]] between the time of [[Calim]]'s binding and that city-state's fall.",
        "Description": "Rosey had a birthmark on his cheek that looked something like a [[strawberry]] and that had earned him his nickname. He was a hulk of a man. As a ''musar'', he wore a red braid.",
        "History": "Rosey served in the army of Cursrah for twelve years. In {{Yearlink|-6048}}, while thoroughly inebriated, he participated in a friendly bar fight with the young officer cadet [[Tafir]], but their raucous competition was stopped by their commanding officer.\n\nUpon leaving the bar, two assassins from the [[hatori (guild)|hatori guild]] attacked Tafir's female companion, having recognized that she was in fact the princess of Cursrah, [[Amenstar]]. Amenstar found herself nearly strangled to death by a [[garrote]] and carried off to a thieves' den, but was pursued by her friends and many soldiers and civilians from the tavern. Rosey saved her life by punching her captor with a powerful blow, and he began carrying her to safety, but his neck was slit by another assassin, killing him."
