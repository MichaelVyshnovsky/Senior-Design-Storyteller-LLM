        "mainbody": "'''Morbus''' was a strange beggar â€“ a sentient [[zombie]], who shambled across the alleys of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''She hides in the ground, but I will find her. No... no, she is just good at keeping still.''|Strange Beggar Morbus}}",
        "Description": "Morbus was wrapped in rags, his face hidden under a hood and a scarf. Morbus's sickly skin and stench of decay betrayed his [[undead]] zombie nature. Unlike other zombies, however, he was fully conscious and possessed undead fortitude and resistance to all types of physical damage.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Morbus was created by the mysterious [[mummy]], the [[Mystic Carrion]]. Eventually, Morbus escaped his undead master along with several other sentient zombies. In 1492 DR, he could be seen wandering around the [[Lower City Graveyard]] of Baldur's Gate. The undead creature seemed to have lost his mind, searching for his older sister who, according to Morbus, was playing hide and seek. Presumably, his sister was among those buried in the graveyard, despite the undead shambles claims she was just very good at the game and Morbus could never win."
