        "mainbody": "orbus was a strange beggar â€“ a sentient zombie, who shambled across the alleys of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nMorbus was wrapped in rags, his face hidden under a hood and a scarf. Morbuss sickly skin and stench of decay betrayed his undead zombie nature. Unlike other zombies, however, he was fully conscious and possessed undead fortitude and resistance to all types of physical damage.\nSometime before the , Morbus was created by the mysterious mummy, the Mystic Carrion. Eventually, Morbus escaped his undead master along with several other sentient zombies. In 1492 DR, he could be seen wandering around the Lower City Graveyard of Baldurs Gate. The undead creature seemed to have lost his mind, searching for his older sister who, according to Morbus, was playing hide and seek. Presumably, his sister was among those buried in the graveyard, despite the undead shambles claims she was just very good at the game and Morbus could never win."
