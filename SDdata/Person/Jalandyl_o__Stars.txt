Jalandyl o Stars was an agent of the Harpers who posed as a dancer at the Drunken Lion alehouse in Archenbridge.
While scarred somewhat by her travels and adventures, she was easily the most attractive of the Lions ladies.
Jalandyl also possessed an incredible knowledge of the mountain areas surrounding Archendale, often selling maps of the region to explorers.
Often coming to the aid of those who were harmed within the city, Jalandyls permanence and anonymity were ensured by the twenty-thousand-gold-piece debt the owner of the Drunken Lion, Meerkun Habalar, owed her. While they neither trusted nor enjoyed each others presence, their partnership lasted over twenty years. Jalandyl and Jalia Mossgreen of the Old Stonebows Inn knew each other well, including keeping secret each others hidden lives, while both spied for and helped one another.
