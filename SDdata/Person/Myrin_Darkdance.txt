'''Myrin Darkdance''', whose birth name was '''Maerlyn''', was a young [[spellscar]]red [[human]] [[wizard]] originally from [[Westgate]].{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|4333}}

==Relations==
Myrin's father [[Neveren Darkdance]] was a [[half-elf]], probably [[half-drow]],<ref group="note">A picture of Myrin's father showed him to have particularly dusky skin, and magic in his home responded to commands spoken in the [[Drow language]]. and her mother [[Shalis Ptolexis]] was of [[Mulhorand|Mulhorandi]] descent.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|1493}}

==Abilities==
Myrin had one of the most powerful spellscars known to exist. She was able to absorb and use the magical abilities and memories of any creature she came into contact with.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1745}} She could also absorb and contain harmful spellscars such as those that plagued [[Kalen Dren]] and [[Ilira Nathalan]].{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|3158}} [[Fayne]] hinted that part of [[Mystra]] might be trapped inside Myrin and she believed Myrin would eventually bring about the destruction of the world by siphoning and then accidentally unleashing the [[magic]] of an extremely powerful being. This may have been the motivation of [[Lilten]] when he attempted to kidnap Myrin because, as a follower of [[Beshaba]], the ultimate misfortune he could cause the world would be its destruction.

==History==
===Early Life===
Myrin was born into the noble [[House Darkdance]] of Westgate in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. Her father Neveren was a member of the [[Night Masks]] and was killed in the same year that she was born, leaving her mother Shalis, a [[Celebrant of Sharess|Celebrant]] of [[Sharess]], to raise her alone. In her youth, Myrin ran away from her mother and apprenticed herself to wizards all over [[Faerûn]], in an attempt to become an [[incantatrix]],{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|4800}} even apprenticing under [[Manshoon]] while he was using the identity of [[Orbakh]].{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|2867}} At some point during or after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Myrin was trapped in a pocket of Spellplague. 

===Waterdeep===
Myrin manifested in [[Waterdeep]] from time to time as a weeping young woman surrounded by blue flame. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[paladin]] Kalen Dren came across Myrin's [[spectre]] and rescued her from the patch of Spellplague she was trapped in. Kalen befriended Myrin and took her back to the rowhouse he shared with his adopted sister [[Cellica]] and the two nursed Myrin back to health. She appeared to have little-to-no memory of her past.

Kalen later escorted Myrin to a costume ball at the temple of [[Sune]] in Waterdeep. Myrin was abducted from the ball by minions of Beshaba's high priest, Lilten. However, she was able to escape when she drained the magic of a [[lich]] and then turned the power against the creature. Unfortunately, she nearly destroyed the nearby buildings.

Myrin was later kidnapped by another of Lilten's employees, [[Rath]], who imprisoned her in a bell tower. She was once again rescued by Kalen who captured Rath and turned him over to the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]. As thanks for Kalen's actions, Myrin siphoned some of the Spellplague that was killing Kalen out of his body.

===Luskan===
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Myrin was traveling through [[north Faerûn]] in a [[dwarf|dwarven]] caravan when it was attacked by [[Sithe]], a high-ranking member of the [[Dead Rats]] gang in [[Luskan]].  Sithe took Myrin back to the Dead Rats' headquarters.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|364}} The gang realized that, because of Myrin's power, they couldn't hold her against her will so they told her she was the new queen of the gang, which placated her. Shortly thereafter, Kalen arrived to rescue her but found she was content in her new role.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|?}}

Myrin took it upon herself to investigate the cause of the [[Fury]] plague that was sweeping Luskan. She made several forays with Kalen and Sithe into Luskan but was unable to locate the cause of the malady. Later, the trio, along with a young [[paladin]] named [[Rhetegast Hawkwinter]] found the [[demon]] responsible for the plague in Luskan's underground and apparently destroyed him.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|6237}}

===Westgate===
Later in 1480 DR, Myrin traveled with Kalen to Westgate to determine what became of Rhett. While in Westgate, Myrin discovered her ancestral home, [[Darkdance Manor]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|835}} Shortly thereafter, she met [[Ilira Nathalan]], who had been a student of her father's. Myrin followed Ilira around Westgate and investigated the [[Lair of the Night Masters]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|?}} Myrin helped to defeat [[Fayne]] when she attacked Ilira to avenge her mother's death.{{Cite digital book/Eye of Justice|5383}}

==Relationships==
Myrin was attracted to Kalen and was heartbroken when he slept with Fayne. At some point prior to the Spellplague, Myrin was lovers with [[Umbra]]{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|3981}} and Lord [[Methrammar Aerasumé]] of [[Silverymoon]] was attracted to her.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|2988}}

==Description==
Myrin had unusual features that made her origin difficult to place. Although she believed herself to be from a city beginning with "West" (perhaps Westgate), Myrin had dusky skin, slightly pointed ears, and appeared to be partly [[half-elf|half-elven]], [[Calishite]], or possibly [[Mulan]]. In 1479 DR, shortly after Kalen freed her from the Spellplague fragment, Myrin was very thin, apparently from a lack of eating or an extremely fast metabolism. By 1480 DR, Myrin had filled out nicely and was no longer a skinny waif. When she used her spellscar, glowing blue runes appeared on her skin.

==Trivia==
By 1480 DR, Myrin was a vegetarian.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|848}}
