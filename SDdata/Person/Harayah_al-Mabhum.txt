Harayah al-Mabhum was a powerful sorceress living in Hiyal around 1367 DR.
Throughout her long life Harayah served on all sides of the conflicts of the court in Hiyal. She was able to use her specialty in magic to make figures at court disappear, both figuratively and literally.
Harayah disappeared after a visit from Prince Anjar bin Alurah. Her servants sealed the entrance to her home with bricks immediately after that visit.
