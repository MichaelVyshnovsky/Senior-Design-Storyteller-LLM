'''Everdingen''' was an upstanding [[Netherese]] [[paladin]] who led the guards at the [[Netheril Mint]] in [[Eileanar]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
He was in overall command of the Mint's guards, with [[Szematseen]] and [[Fieschi]] as his immediate lieutenants. All three were extremely devoted to the cause, and refused to allow any errors or corruption to occur.
