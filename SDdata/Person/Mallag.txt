'''Mallag''' was a [[derro]] from [[Ravagestone]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Quest for Sporedome|9}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Mallag was exiled from his town for being too insane even for derro standards. He fell in league with [[Sacred Seer]], a mutated [[myconid]] follower of the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]].

The Sacred Seer sent Mallag to [[Sporedome]] to gather treasures and spore servants to her cause. However, Mallag was killed by some fungi mutated by the madness-infected ''[[faerzress]]''.
