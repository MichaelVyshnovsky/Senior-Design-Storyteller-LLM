'''Myste''' was a [[human]] [[illusionist]].

==Description==
Myste clad herself in blue robes, with a matching blue headband and blue earrings. She had black hair, light skin, and attractive features.

==Personality==
She was especially fond of using [[spell]]s involving color or fog, preferring to use those in place of the more standard [[illusion]] spells.

==Possessions==
Myste owned a ''[[stone of mixed luck]]'',{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|132|Myste's Stone of Mixed Luck}} a ''[[luckstone]]'' variant that ensured her good luck 85% of the time. The remaining 15% were utterly unfortunate, forcing her to endure many embarrassing and comical blunders.

She also owned a powerful ''[[ring of protection]] +4''.

==History==
Although she originally intended to become a generic wizard, Myste found herself drawn toward illusion [[magic]]. When a teacher informed her she was merely "chasing clouds", she replied "Then call me Myste!", thereby adopting a new moniker.
