Myste was a human illusionist.
Myste clad herself in blue robes, with a matching blue headband and blue earrings. She had black hair, light skin, and attractive features.
She was especially fond of using spells involving color or fog, preferring to use those in place of the more standard illusion spells.
Myste owned a stone of mixed luck, a luckstone variant that ensured her good luck 85% of the time. The remaining 15% were utterly unfortunate, forcing her to endure many embarrassing and comical blunders.
She also owned a powerful ring of protection +4.
Although she originally intended to become a generic wizard, Myste found herself drawn toward illusion magic. When a teacher informed her she was merely "chasing clouds", she replied "Then call me Myste!", thereby adopting a new moniker.
