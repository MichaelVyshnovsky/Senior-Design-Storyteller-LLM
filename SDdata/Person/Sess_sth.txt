'''Sess'sth''' was the leader of a tribe of [[lizardfolk]] in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]].

|Our king, Sess'sth, very strong, very angry, but stupid, like big tree.

==Description==
The king lived in a great stone fort, and ruled over other lizardmen. He fought with a spiked [[club]] and a [[buckler]].

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], the three adventurers [[Kromlech Bruenghor]], [[Vahn]], and [[Adrianna]] arrived in the Marsh of Chelimber. A [[shaman]], [[Sleyvas]], told them that a great [[Onyx Tower]] had appeared in the marsh, and that its owner was causing the local lizardfolk to rally. He said that, in order to scatter the tribes, they had to break its spine. This referred to Sess'sth, who led the lizardmen. The three heroes agreed to take him down.

When the trio entered the fort, Sess'sth accused them of trespassing and, after a threat, the two sides engaged in combat. The king was slain.
