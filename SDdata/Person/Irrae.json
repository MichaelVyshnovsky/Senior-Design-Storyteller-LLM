Irrae set to journeying trough [[Vilebog]] swamp, collecting flora specimens, investigating floating motes of light, and even stealing distillation techniques from the local populace.\n\nIrrae worked with [[Tragold|Scout Tragold]] and the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to repair the rope bridges that were found throughout the swamp, in order for their expedition to continue further into the searing [[earthmote]]."
