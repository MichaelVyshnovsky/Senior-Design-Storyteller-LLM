'''Uthred''' was a young warmage from [[Impiltur]]. He was a part of the attack on the enclave of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Tarsakh 12]],{{cite book/The Rage||18}} and participated also in a second desperation attack after the rout on [[Tarsakh 16]], where he perished.

==Description==
Uthred was still relatively young, but affected long blonde whiskers, presumably to look like more of a mighty wizard.{{cite book/The Rage||20}}

==Abilities==
Uthred had been the one to conceal a group of archers from the Cult's forces during the rout.{{cite book/The Rage||22}}

==Debriefing==
After [[Quelsandas]] cast the [[aggravate dracorage]] spell in the [[Gray Forest]], routing the forces of Impiltur on behalf of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] on [[Tarsakh 12]], Uthred was one of the warmages supported the retreat of a group of archers by rendering them invisible and providing cover with spells.{{cite book/The Rage||21}} He was slain by the dracolich guardian of the enclave with a breath of corrosive acid.
