Caliph Kia al-Sadid, also called the Humble Servant of the Enlightened Gods, was the ruler of Talab in the Pantheist League of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR. 
Mousy and slouching, Kias physical appearance masked the power he wielded in Talab.
Though soft-spoken, his words held great wisdom.
Kia was installed by the League Conclave as the interim caliph of Talab following the assassination of his predecessor. He proved to be a capable administrator, and while he was not often seen in public his decrees were felt throughout the city.
