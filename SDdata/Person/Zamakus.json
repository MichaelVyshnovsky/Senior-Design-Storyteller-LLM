        "mainbody": "'''Zamakus''' was a diligent Captain of [[Mulmaster]]'s city guard and a bodyguard of Ambassador [[Reyvan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Captain Zamakus had a commanding presence and a serious attitude towards his duty.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Zamakus was a trusted Captain of the guard in Mulmaster on the [[Moonsea]]. In the winter of 1373 DR, Zamakus supervised a [[gemstone golem]] march in celebration of the marriage anniversary between Mulmaster's [[High Blade]] [[Selfaril Uoumdolphin]] and [[Thayan]] [[Tharchion]]ess [[Dmitra Flass]]. A dozen of exuberantly expensive golems were sent from Thay by Ambassador Reyvan as a demonstration of power and, as later became apparent, an assassination attempt. Under Zamakus's and his guards' watchful eyes, the impressive parade marched from the harbors of Mulmaster towards the city's [[Thayan enclave (Mulmaster)|Thayan Enclave]] where the celebration was taking place. During the parade, Zamakus briefly exchanged words with the [[Hero of Daggerford]] and his companions, who were searching for a way into the sinister southern enclave."
