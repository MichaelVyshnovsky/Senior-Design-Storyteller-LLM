Captain Tobias Querl was a human fighter who served Gondegal in the Twilight Brigade in 1352 DR and Lord Vorik Aris as the Captain of the Guard of Wyvernwatch Castle in 1369 DR.
He had a scarred face, square jaw, squinty eyes and salt-and-pepper hair.
Tobias was a grizzled, experienced veteran, who was fully inured to the military lifestyle. He was a strict disciplinarian, with a warped code of honor that meant he saw nothing wrong with slaughtering innocent villagers.
He wielded a +2 saber and a dagger together, and wore +3 chain mail and a ring of free action.
He was fiercely devoted to Lord Aris and would fight to the death for him, seeing him as the right man to "continue the good work started by Gondegal."
In 1352 DR, he participated in Gondegals war on Cormyr as part of the Twilight Brigade, the contingent of troops that razed and slaughtered Darkenshield in the Stonelands.
By the , he had joined up with Lord Aris, and served as the Captain of the Guard of Wyvernwatch Castle. After gathering his army, Lord Aris marched on the ruins of Darkenshield to begin his raids on the Cormyrean settlements of the Stonelands, and Tobias rode at the head of the troops. When the vengeful spirits of Darkenshield were roused in response, Tobias and the other participants of the slaughter were separated from Aris army and torn apart.
