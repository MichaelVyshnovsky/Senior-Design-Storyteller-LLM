Zespara Alather was a talented swordsmith who ran the House of the Bright Blade in Mirabar around 1370 DR.
Occasionally one to partake in adventuring, Zespara had powerful friends, notably, several anonymous mages. Also a member of the Harpers, she also sometimes operated as an agent of the Lords Alliance. As such, Zespara Alather had slain many dangerous members of evil organizations such as the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards, and the Arcane Brotherhood.
She was served by six apprentices, the oldest of whom was Calauthra Morgyr.
