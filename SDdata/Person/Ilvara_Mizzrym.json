        "mainbody": "'''Ilvara Mizzrym''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "The priestess was a very ambitious and cruel individual, wanting to rise in Lolth's esteem. She considered commanding the outpost garrison at Velkynvelve as a stepping stone in her ascension. She also knew the posting was temporary, and she intended to wring every advantage from it in the meantime. Ilvara also enjoyed taunting and tormenting enemies and underlings alike.",
        "Possessions": "Ilvara wielded a ''[[tentacle rod]]''.",
        "Activities": "Ilvara was a drow of [[Menzoberranzan]] and a member of [[House Mizzrym]], commanding the [[Velkynvelve]] outpost.",
        "Relationships": "Ilvara first had [[Jorlan Duskryn]] as a lover, but discarded him after his crippling injuries. She later took [[Shoor Vandree]] but cared no more about him than she did about Jorlan.",
        "History": "During the [[demon]]ic crisis in the [[Underdark]] in the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], there was a great escape of prisoners. Ilvara decided to personally pursue the fugitive prisoners with her lieutenants."
