        "mainbody": "Ilvara Mizzrym was a drow priestess of Lolth during the late 15 century DR.\nThe priestess was a very ambitious and cruel individual, wanting to rise in Lolths esteem. She considered commanding the outpost garrison at Velkynvelve as a stepping stone in her ascension. She also knew the posting was temporary, and she intended to wring every advantage from it in the meantime. Ilvara also enjoyed taunting and tormenting enemies and underlings alike.\nIlvara wielded a tentacle rod.\nIlvara was a drow of Menzoberranzan and a member of House Mizzrym, commanding the Velkynvelve outpost.\nIlvara first had Jorlan Duskryn as a lover, but discarded him after his crippling injuries. She later took Shoor Vandree but cared no more about him than she did about Jorlan.\nDuring the demonic crisis in the Underdark in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, there was a great escape of prisoners. Ilvara decided to personally pursue the fugitive prisoners with her lieutenants."
