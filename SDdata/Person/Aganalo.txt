Madman '''Aganalo''' was a warrior who had become mad, during his stay in a strange device of [[the Underdark]].

==Possessions==
He wielded an enchanted bastard sword named [[Jhor the Bleeder]].

==History==
Prior to [[1369 DR]], Aganalo became trapped in the leftmost facet of the [[Facet sphere]]. Due to his isolation from society, he became mad and hostile. Even if set free, he did not believe he was truly was, as he had seen too many illusions during his entrapment.
