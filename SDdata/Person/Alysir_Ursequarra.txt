'''Alysir Ursequarra''' was a female [[fey'ri]] and a member of the [[daemonfey]].

==History==
As lady of the [[House Ursequarra|Ursequarra]] house in [[1374 DR]], she attended a meeting ofÂ the [[daemonfey]] gathered by their leader [[Sarya Dlardrageth]]. Sarya considered Alysir very stupid and would kill her if the fey'ri were not irreplaceably few in number.

After the daemonfey's defeat at the [[Vale of Lost Voices]], Alysir questioned Sarya's authority and at last Sarya destroyed Alysir.
