Alysir Ursequarra was a female feyri and a member of the daemonfey.
As lady of the Ursequarra house in 1374 DR, she attended a meeting ofÂ the daemonfey gathered by their leader Sarya Dlardrageth. Sarya considered Alysir very stupid and would kill her if the feyri were not irreplaceably few in number.
After the daemonfeys defeat at the Vale of Lost Voices, Alysir questioned Saryas authority and at last Sarya destroyed Alysir.
