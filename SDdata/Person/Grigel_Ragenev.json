        "mainbody": "'''Grigel Ragenev''' was an alchemist working for the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in {{yearlink|1373}}. Two days after the ''[[dracorage mythal]]'' was destroyed, on [[Nightal 8]], the [[white dragon]] [[Ssalangan]] accused him and the other cultists of deceiving them that the [[Rage of Dragons]] of that year would never end. Though Grigel explained that [[Sammaster]] had told them as much as he told the dragons and Ssalangan believed him, the dragon decided to eat him anyway.{{cite book/The Ruin||13}}"
