Bartholomew Tidfigit was the owner of The Royal Arms Inn in Luskan in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Bartholomew was tall and lean. His appearance was more akin to a scholar than a barkeep. He was generally curt with the customers. He did not pay mind to "smelly ruffians" who did not appear to be able to afford the luxurious accommodations of his inn.
Bartholomew Tidfigit was a life-long resident of Luskan. He was extremely proud of his establishment.
Bartholomew was familiar with most established traders passing through and based in Luskan who could afford to regularly stay in his inn, such as Boswell Peddywinkle.
Around Tarsakh, 1369 DR, Bartholomew Tidfigit directed a group of adventurers looking for employment to Boswell Peddywinkle (secretly Celerum the Black).
