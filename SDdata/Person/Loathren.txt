'''Loathren''' was a [[wizard]] of [[Phlan]] some time in the late 13{{th}} or  14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|16-17}}<ref group="note">It is unknown when Loathren lived and died, but given the timeline of Maskyr's Tower it is presumed to be within the lifetime of [[Khonduil Ammargath]], and thus less than a century before the late 1350s DR.

==History==
One day, Loathren of Phlan came to the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] and made efforts to erect a tower on the place where once had stood [[Maskyr's Tower]], the home of the vanished [[archmage]] [[Maskyr One-Eye]], perhaps in an attempt to learn his secrets and magic. However, the stones laying about the bluff rose up of their own accord, spun about like leaves in a whirlwind, and rained down upon his camp, killing Loathren. Naturally, stories spread that this was Maskyr One-Eye's doing, or his abandoned [[magic]], or a curse. Yet others claimed local [[dwarves]] were responsible, somehow, or that it was the work of a rival wizard opposed to Loathren acquiring Maskyr's arcane mastery. The curse story proved more popular and [[bard]]s carried it far, so much fewer [[adventurer]]s and ambitious mages came poking around the site.
