'''Swipe''' was the nickname of the rat-faced head of the [[Hillsfar Rogues' Guild|Rogues' Guild]] in [[Hillsfar]] in [[1367 DR]]. He and his guild acted as personal spies in the city for Lord [[Maalthiir]] but working too close with the [[Red Plumes]] prevented Swipe and his men from uncovering the true menace.
