Sozarro was a deserter of the Golden Legion in Maztica around 1362 DR.
Sozarro was a practical man. He believed himself to be moved by his need for gold, but he was not greedy and at heart he searched for a great adventure that could prove him to be a noble, valiant, and courageous man, and maybe grant him a place in Maztican history.
When he went on his journey across the Pasocada Basin, Sozarro carried a light lance and longsword, a portable hole, and a skin of pouring.
Sozarro was one of the legionaries who first came to Maztica with Cordell. He remained with the Helmsport garrison but soon grew bored of taking orders from weak people. At this point, he fell in love with a beautiful Payit, but his commanding officer also became infatuated with that girl. Sozarro challenged the superior to a duel and killed him. Afterward, he had to escape, taking with himself the officers hoard and his only companion, his loyal personal servant Malco. After fleeing from his crimes, Sozarro continued to be a wanted man in Payit.
Wandering around Maztica, he heard about the story of Michaca, the City of Gold, and decided to locate it. He decided to hire an adventuring party to accompany him.
He met and hired an adventuring party, financing them with his officers treasure, but pretended to work for an Amnian merchant house.
