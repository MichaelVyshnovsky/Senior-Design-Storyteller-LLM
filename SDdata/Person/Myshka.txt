{{quote|''Are yerrrr mer mermer?''|Myshka the Cat}}

==Description==
Myshka was a white and fluffy beast with huge blue eyes who spoke in the [[Mriaer]] dialect of the [[feline language]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Myshka could be found in the alleyways of the Lower City, where the creature sought its "mermer," ("mother" in Mriaer dialect). Myshka could've found a home with [[Derryth Bonecloak]], a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] apothecary, who ran the [[Bonecloak Apothecary]] shop not far from the [[Sorcerous Sundries]] shop in the Lower City, with little help from the True Heroes of Baldur's Gate and a use of ''[[speak with animals]]'' spell or other similar means.
