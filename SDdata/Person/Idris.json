However, the appearance of this undead army alarmed Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], who sent a contingent of his army to stop them, accompanied by [[Doomguide]] [[Vesper Soulhearth]].\n\nTo deal with the situation, Vesper recruited an adventurer to destroy the Deathknell. The adventurer fought and defeated Idris and destroyed the Deathknell, stopping the dead from rising."
