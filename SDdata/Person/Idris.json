        "mainbody": "Idris was a Netherese necromancer who lived in Neverwinter in 1484 DR.\nIn the burial grounds of Ebon Downs on the High Road, she found a powerful artifact known as the Deathknell and with it Idris made pacts with the Barrow Lords of Ebon Downs, seeking to build an army of undead to strike at their Thayan foes. However, the appearance of this undead army alarmed Lord Dagult Neverember, who sent a contingent of his army to stop them, accompanied by Doomguide Vesper Soulhearth.\nTo deal with the situation, Vesper recruited an adventurer to destroy the Deathknell. The adventurer fought and defeated Idris and destroyed the Deathknell, stopping the dead from rising."
