Belsarth Hawkblade was a Highknight of Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
He often went without shaving.
Hawkblade was grim, but his loyalty to the crown was unshakable. Despite his grimness, he was always cheery enough to hear about a wizard being disparaged.
Belsarth was a highknight.
Together with Lorton Ironstone, Belsarth Hawkblade was part of an ambush waiting for Elminster Aumar when the latter tried to sneak into Castle Obarskyr in Suzail sometime after Mirtul 26 of the . Though Elminster was able to disable Hawkblade briefly with the use of a small dazzle powder bomb, reinforcements were in wait for precisely that eventuality. It was ultimately the ghost of the Regent Alusair Obarskyr that saved Elminster, knocking Belsarth him out cold.
