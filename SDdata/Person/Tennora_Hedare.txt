'''Tennora Hedare''' was a young apprentice [[wizard]] and a member of one of [[Waterdeep]]'s minor noble houses in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She worked as a spy for [[Nazra Mrays]], a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord of Waterdeep]].	

==Description==
Tennora had blonde hair that she wore in a single braid. She prefered wearing her mother's [[leather armor]] to a mage robe.

==Abilities==
Tennora had modest magical skills. She learned to pick locks from a [[rogue]] near the harbor and had been paying him for further instruction in roguish arts.

==History==
Tennora's parents died during a [[featherlung]] epidemic while she was still a child.  Unknown to Tennora, her mother was an accomplished rogue before she married into the nobility. She was raised in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] by her father's brother and his wife. Tennora studied [[magic]] at the [[House of Wonders]] mage academy in Waterdeep but she was dismissed by Master [[Rhinzen Halnian]] because he didn't think she had much potential as a mage even though she was capable of casting moderately powerful magic such as the ''[[fireball]]'' spell.

Tennora lived in an apartment at the [[God Catcher]] tenement. One day in [[1479 DR]], a seemingly crazy woman stood outside the building and ranted all day at [[Aundra Blacklock]], the landlord. Tennora took pity on the woman, who was actually the [[blue dragon]] [[Clytemorrenestrix]] (Nestrix) who was [[plaguechanged]] into a human, and agreed to get her an audience with Aundra. Nestrix asked Aundra to use her [[sorceress]] powers to turn her back into a dragon and Aundra agreed if Nestrix would steal a magical mask from a shop in the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep|Trades Ward]].

Tennora and Nestrix broke into the shop and took the mask. However, unknown to either of them, the shop was owned by the [[green dragon]] [[Andareunarthex]], who tracked them back to Tennora's apartment and kidnapped Nestrix. Tennora was able to rescue Nestrix with the help of the bounty hunter [[Veron Angalen]] and they also freed Nazra Mrays' young son. Tennora and Nestrix defeated Andareunarthex in a battle at Nazra's mansion and drove him out of Waterdeep.

In [[1486 DR]], [[Vescaras Ammakyl]] recruited Tennora into the [[Harpers]] and she acted as liaison between [[Tam Zawad]]'s cell and the Lords of Waterdeep.{{Cite dragon/430/The Harpers of Waterdeep}}
