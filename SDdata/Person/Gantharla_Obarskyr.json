She wore mottled green foresters leathers including a hood, and an elven chain shirt tinted green.\nGantharlas father was Boldovar the Mad. Her brother was Iltharl the Insufficient.\nShe had an illegitimate son before her coronation, Roderin Obarskyr.\nGantharla had a sword called Shiningbite. The sword was also known as Drakes Tooth, and there was also a Cormyrian ship by that name.\nGantharla had patrolled the Western Marches of Cormyr with her foresters. She stationed her foresters on Soldiers Green near Suzail and marched into Faerlthanns Keep, thinking Iltharl was interfering with her plans, but he abdicated the throne to her, making her the first queen of Cormyr."
