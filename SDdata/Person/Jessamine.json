        "mainbody": "Jessamine () was one of the merchant prince of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR. She dealt in herbology goods and even poisons, along with sanctioned assassinations that were approved by her and fellow merchant princes.\nAlthough one of the wealthiest and most powerful merchants in Port Nyanzaru, she was a dangerous assassin by training. Her specialty was the use of poison, particularly torpor.\nShe dressed in billowing robes and black wrappings.\nJessamine was one of the more reserved merchant princes. She rarely spoke, and always carefully considered her words and actions.\nShe was not above scheming against other powerful figures in Port Nyanzaru, but always denied knowledge of any actions taken by her hirelings or spies.\nJessamine had a daughter, Yemzra, who came as a result of a dalliance she had with a sea captain from Amn. She ensured that her daughter received a strong education, in order that she could continue her mothers business interests.\nShe was skeptical of Sibonseni, the wealthy high priestess at the Hall of Gold, whom she suspected of aspiring to become a merchant prince.\nShe had assassins, mercenaries, and more than one wizard in her service.\nShe lived in a clifftop villa in the Merchants Ward with a balcony that overlooked Port Nyanzaru. The mansion was often dimly lit by oil lamps and the walls were adorned with carvings of snakes. This home was protected by hooded warriors who stood like statues in the shadows.\nShe had a vast personal collection of poisons.\nJessamine held a monopoly over the sale of herbs, plants, and poisons within the city of Port Nyanzaru.While Jessamine controlled the sale of plants, she notably did not control the sale of fruit, which fell under the purview of the merchant prince Kwayoth√©. This included a prized local poison known as venomtail poison, however some hunters like Doriak of the Shells were known to trade for it amongst each other.\nIn addition, she controlled the sale of \"sanctions\", i.e., writs of assassination that licensed the holder to commit a murder via an approved method (usually poisoning or stabbing). She charged an extra fee to provide an assassin to carry out the killing, with satisfaction guaranteed. Her assassins made use of high quality, extremely sharp obsidian daggers.\nIn her capacity as a merchant princes, she met in council with the other six princes at their palace of Goldenthrone to make governance decisions.\nJessamine often sent brave adventurers into the jungles of Chult to gather zabou mushroom samples for her. A dangerous but lucrative task.\nIn her youth, Jessamine worked as an assassin for one of the pashas of Calimshan. She died during one of her assignments, and was resurrected at great cost to her patron.\nWhen the death curse was released upon Toril, Jessamine began to wither away as her prior resurrection began to unravel. To hide her affliction, Jessamine wrapped her body in black bandages and wore heavy scarves.\nDuring the death curse investigation, Jessamine helmed the effort to make routes of Chult safe from recent increase of vegepygmy attacks. She instructed Eku and a group of adventurers to track down and slay one of the vegepygmy chieftains. Following its death, the plant creatures dispersed, fleeing into the jungle, making the paths relatively safe for travel once again. Shortly after, Jessamine asked the adventurers for one more favor, slaying the massive girallon known as the Great Ape, who was ravaging the routes outside of Port Nyanzaru. In exchange, she offered leads on the death curse investigation gained through her wizards divinations."
