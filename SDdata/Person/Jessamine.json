        "Description": "Although one of the wealthiest and most powerful merchants in Port Nyanzaru, she was a dangerous [[assassin]] by training. Her specialty was the use of poison, particularly [[torpor]].\n\nShe dressed in billowing [[robe]]s and black wrappings.",
        "Personality": "Jessamine was one of the more reserved merchant princes. She rarely spoke, and always carefully considered her words and actions.\n\nShe was not above scheming against other powerful figures in Port Nyanzaru, but always denied knowledge of any actions taken by her hirelings or spies.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|13}}",
        "Relationships": "Jessamine had a daughter, [[Yemzra]], who came as a result of a dalliance she had with a sea captain from [[Amn]]. She ensured that her daughter received a strong education, in order that she could continue her mother's business interests.\n\nShe was skeptical of [[Sibonseni]], the wealthy high [[priestess]] at the [[Hall of Gold]], whom she suspected of aspiring to become a merchant prince.\n\nShe had assassins, mercenaries, and more than one [[wizard]] in her service.",
        "Possessions": "She lived in a clifftop villa in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] with a balcony that overlooked Port Nyanzaru. The mansion was often dimly lit by [[oil lamp]]s and the walls were adorned with carvings of [[snake]]s. This home was protected by hooded warriors who stood like statues in the shadows.\n\nShe had a vast personal collection of poisons.",

This included a prized local poison known as [[venomtail poison]], however some [[hunter]]s like [[Doriak|Doriak of the Shells]] were known to trade for it amongst each other.\n\nIn addition, she controlled the sale of \"sanctions\", i.e., writs of assassination that licensed the holder to commit a murder via an approved method (usually poisoning or stabbing). She charged an extra fee to provide an assassin to carry out the killing, with satisfaction guaranteed. Her assassins made use of high quality, extremely sharp [[obsidian]] [[dagger]]s.\n\nIn her capacity as a merchant princes, she met in council with the other six princes at their palace of [[Goldenthrone]] to make governance decisions.\n\nJessamine often sent brave adventurers into the jungles of Chult to gather [[zabou mushroom]] samples for her. A dangerous but lucrative task.{{Template:Cite game/Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation}}",
