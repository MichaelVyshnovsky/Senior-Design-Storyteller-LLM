        "mainbody": "In her youth, Jessamine worked as an assassin for one of the pashas of Calimshan. She died during one of her assignments, and was resurrected at great cost to her patron.\nWhen the death curse was released upon Toril, Jessamine began to wither away as her prior resurrection began to unravel. To hide her affliction, Jessamine wrapped her body in black bandages and wore heavy scarves.\nDuring the death curse investigation, Jessamine helmed the effort to make routes of Chult safe from recent increase of vegepygmy attacks. She instructed Eku and a group of adventurers to track down and slay one of the vegepygmy chieftains. Following its death, the plant creatures dispersed, fleeing into the jungle, making the paths relatively safe for travel once again. Shortly after, Jessamine asked the adventurers for one more favor, slaying the massive girallon known as the Great Ape, who was ravaging the routes outside of Port Nyanzaru. In exchange, she offered leads on the death curse investigation gained through her wizards divinations."
