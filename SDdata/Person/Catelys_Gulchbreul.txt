Catelys Gulchbreul was an illithid of the Absolute from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Catelys Gulchbreul was a duergar or a drow, who was infected by the Absolutes tadpole with their transformation likely taking place at the very end of the creatures life.
In the , a large group of duergar, giant spiders, and drow, was slaughtered in the home of a Bloomridge Park groundskeeper, Lavernica. The murder spree was performed by Orin the Red and her Murder Tribunal of Bhaal. Catelys Gulchbreuls body was found already in its aberrant new form in a cellar underneath Lavernicas home, near a butchered drow woman, a grotesque display â€“ an effigy representing Sendai, a drow Bhaalspawn who died a century earlier.
