'''Catelys Gulchbreul''' was an [[illithid]] of the [[Absolute]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Catelys Gulchbreul was a [[duergar]] or a [[drow]], who was infected by the Absolute's [[tadpole]] with their transformation likely taking place at the very end of the creature's life.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a large group of duergar, [[giant spider]]s, and drow, was slaughtered in the home of a [[Bloomridge Park]] groundskeeper, [[Lavernica]]. The murder spree was performed by [[Orin the Red]] and her [[Murder Tribunal]] of [[Bhaal]]. Catelys Gulchbreul's body was found already in its aberrant new form in a cellar underneath Lavernica's home, near a butchered drow woman, a grotesque display â€“ an effigy representing [[Sendai]], a drow [[Bhaalspawn]] who died a century earlier.
