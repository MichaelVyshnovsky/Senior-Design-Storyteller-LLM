        "mainbody": "'''Wund''' was an [[mountain orc]] shaman from the tribes of the [[Sword Mountains]] in [[Northwest Faerûn]]. He was the founder of the [[Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge]] and creator of the [[orc]] realm of [[Uruth Ukrypt]].",
        "History": "Wund prophesied that on the eve of the [[Feast of the Moon]] in the {{YearlinkName|927}}, red clouds would appear over the mountains. On the date in question, this event actually occurred, and blood flowed down the mountains for three days, causing plagues to spread to the surrounding areas, and causing high casualties, in what was known as the [[Blood Plagues]] or the \"White Hand of Yutrus.\" All of the tribal chieftains were wiped out, leaving a power vacuum for Wund to fill. It was after this event that Wund founded the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge, a monastic order dedicated to spiritually uniting the orcs of the Sword Mountains. Wund crowned [[Uruth]] as king and the orcs began driving the [[troll]]s out of the mountains.\n\nUnder Wund's direction, the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt attacked the city of [[Waterdeep]] (then called Nimoar's Hold) in the {{YearlinkName|936}}, beginning the [[Orcfastings War]]. This war only ended after several defeats and the death of Wund himself, leading the orcs to retreat back to the Sword Mountains.",
