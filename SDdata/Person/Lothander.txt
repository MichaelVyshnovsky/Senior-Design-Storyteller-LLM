'''Lothander''' was an individual who lived in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He had a career as an unwilling assassin for the [[Iron Throne]] mercantile organization.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Lothander was placed under a ''[[geas]]'' spell by [[Marek]], an agent of the Iron Throne. He was forced by Marek to participate in an assassination attempt of the adventurer [[Abdel Adrian]]. The two would use a special [[poison]] that would kill Abdel within a [[tenday]] if an antidote was not consumed.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was believed by the Baldurian [[Haspur]] the fortune teller that a ''geas removal scroll'' owned by [[Jalantha Mistmyr]] could alleviate Lothander of his misfortune.
