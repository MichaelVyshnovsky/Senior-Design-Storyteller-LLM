She had long black hair and emerald green eyes. Her skin was pale to the point of giving her a near ethereal appearance.\nFaren excelled at her role since Harondalbar was somewhat fascinated with her. Given the dragons often stubborn nature and refusal to rouse to confront any non-Zhentarim caravans moving through Yellow Snake Pass, Faren often resorted to creating her own illusions of Harondalbar to warn off unwanted traffic.\nFaren carried a staff of power, bracers of defense, a brooch of shielding, and a pair of winged boots.\nShe usually had the following spells memorized – burning hands, charm person, color spray, comprehend languages, detect magic, feather fall, sleep, shocking grasp, spider climb, phantasmal force, alter self, bind, deafness, fog cloud, insatiable thirst, summon swarm, Melfs acid arrow, Tashas hideous laughter, explosive runes, hold person, lightning bolt, spectral force, and suggestion.\nFaren was an apprentice of both Manshoon and Sememmon.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryEnchanters\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryMembers of the Zhentarim\nCategoryInhabitants of Yellow Snake Pass\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of lawful evil alignment\n7o3i5m90bkjkubhq30ctjq2pqxy4ljd"
