'''Bartimus''' was the House [[mage]] of the noble merchant [[Talricci]] family of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bartimus was a diminutive, pale,

==Personality==
Bartimus was loyal to [[Grozier Talricci]] and followed protocol. Bartimus possessed keen intelligence that allowed him to take care of problems on Grozier's behalf. The wizard kept his chambers dark, lit only with [[candle]]light, and decorated with his favorite rich and dark-colored tapestries, carpets, and furniture of dark wood and [[leather]]. Bartimus was disorganized, and his personal space was littered with countless [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s dedicated to the [[arcane]]. Despite the clutter, Bartimus was adamant about not letting anyone else clean his study, not to disrupt the order in his chaos.

==History==
Several years prior to [[1373 DR]], Bartimus spent some time in [[Cormyr]], where he expanded his knowledge of ''[[the Art]]'' and gained several [[spell]]s exotic to his home – [[Chondath]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Bartimus served Grozier Talricci, the leader of House Talricci. Along with his master, Bartimus willingly joined the cabal between certain members of Talricci, [[Pharaboldi]], and [[Matrell]] families, along with the corrupt Grand Grand Trabbar [[Lavant]] of the [[Temple of Waukeen (Arrabar)|Temple of Waukeen]]. The cabal plotted to initiate a war within the city of Arrabar and rise to power through profiteering off the conflict. Bartimus's magic allowed the members of the cabal to hold meetings inside their minds while in public, surrounded by people, yet another way to keep the cabal hidden.

Bartimus used his magics to ''[[Scry (spell)|scry]]'' the covert operations for Grozier Talricci, including the assassination of [[Jithelle Skolotti]] whose pregnancy came in the way of the cabal's plans regarding the arranged marriage between [[Emriana Matrell]] and [[Denrick Pharaboldi]]. The ''scrying'' allowed the cabal to see the incompetence of the assassin – Captain [[Dressus]], and know that [[Vambran Matrell]] and his sister Emriana witnessed the deed and embarked on a quest to investigate the suspicious event. Later, Bartimus devised a trap for young Vambran that could kill two birds with one stone or one [[leechwalker]] to be precise. The wizard organized Dressus's death, as he outlived his usefulness and lured Vambran Matrell into a trap using Dressus's body. The assassination attempt was unsuccessful in the end, and Vambran survived by sheer luck.

Later that year, during the [[Sammardach]] festival celebration in [[Generon]], the palace of Arrabar, Bartimus ensorcelled [[Marga Talricci]]. The woman married into the Matrell family, and as retaliation for the destroyed cabal, Grozier Talricci ordered the kidnapping of the noble woman's twin children, [[Quindy Matrell|Quindy]] and [[Obiron Matrell II|Obiron]]. The wizard's spell kept the distraught mother silent and compelled her to keep the kidnapping quiet. The twins were eventually rescued by Emriana and [[Xaphira Matrell]].
