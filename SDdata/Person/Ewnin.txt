Ewnin was the son of Count Fisfnilt, a nobleman of Toril, who lived some years before the late 14 century DR.
Sometime before the , Count Fisfnilt was attempting to find a "suitable" bride for Ewnin, who rejected countless women from across Faer√ªn for not meeting his unrealistically high standards. After Count grew exhausted with his progeny, he ordered a court wizard to create a ring of human influence. The ring was gifted to a certain woman of great influence in a large nation. Ewnin fell in love with the woman, and they wed three weeks later.
