'''Erbass''' was a noted warrior of [[Raumathar]] during the waning years of the ancient empire. He took part in a number of the climactic battles during the [[Great Conflagration]] between the [[Raumviran]]s and the [[Nar]], before fleeing east into the depths of the [[Yuirwood]] forest.{{Cite dragon/277/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Soargar's Legacy}}
