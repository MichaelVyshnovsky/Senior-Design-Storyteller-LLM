        "mainbody": "'''Genamine Kopali''' was [[the Guild]] [[Kingpin]] of the [[Baldur's Gate/Seatower|Seatower]] district in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Genamine Kopali was an [[assassin]] by trade and she ran a similar group of ne'er-do-wells in the Seatower district. Her gang included a number of [[druid]]s, who ensured the Guild's facilities were running and controlled a number of defensive beasts, such as [[shambling mound]]s, used to purify the Gate's water.\n\n[[Mortlock Vanthampur]] personally sent Genamine [[coin]] in exchange for information of happenings in the [[sewers of Baldur's Gate]].",
        "History": "When the Guild faced a dangerous upstart crime lord, the [[Stone Lord]], who was secretly allied with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], the new kingpin gradually attacked and took over the Guild's territory. By the time the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}} was raging in the Gate, Genamine Kopali and her [[Sewerkeepers]] were all slain and their headquarters was put to the [[torch]]. Genamine's body was not recovered according to the Guild's reports. Presumably, the Sewerkeepers were killed by the Stone Lord's men, however, it was also likely they were slaughtered by [[Orin]] the Red and her [[Bhaalist]]s who used the sewers as their hunting ground."
