His eyes had a white-hot glow to them.\nAt some point Jay was instructed by Hastsezini to take up residence in the Great Conflagration and observe the creatures that inhabited that elemental plane, though some claimed that his reason for being there was of his own free will.\nSome claimed that Jays gaze could cause any object to erupt into flames."
