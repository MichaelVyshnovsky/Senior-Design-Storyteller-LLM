Francis was a pottery merchant from the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Francis had dark skin and short black hair. He wore a dark green tunic tan pants and leather boots.
In 1492 DR, an illithid nautiloid descended on the city of Baldurs Gate, abducting numerous citizens of the city. Francis was snatched by the ships tentacles as he was pulling his merchants cart. On board, Francis, like many other unfortunates, was infected with a mind flayer tadpole. Soon after the abduction, a group of fellow victims, led by Tav, managed to return the nautiloid to the Prime Material plane, crushing it in the Western Heartlands. Francis perished in the crash and his broken body was left behind in chaos and rubble.
