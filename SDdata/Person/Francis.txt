'''Francis''' was a pottery merchant from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Francis had dark skin and short black hair. He wore a dark green [[tunic]] tan pants and leather [[boots]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], an [[illithid]] [[nautiloid]] descended on the city of Baldur's Gate, abducting numerous citizens of the city. Francis was snatched by the ship's tentacles as he was pulling his merchant's cart. On board, Francis, like many other unfortunates, was infected with a mind flayer [[tadpole]]. Soon after the abduction, a group of fellow victims, led by [[Tav]], managed to return the nautiloid to the [[Prime Material plane]], crushing it in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Francis perished in the crash and his broken body was left behind in chaos and rubble.
