        "mainbody": "Taburg Shen was a farmer who lived in the village of Eveningstar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was a respectful, quiet, and introverted man.\nTabards farm and apple orchard were located along the High Road on the western outskirts of Eveningstar. Apart from apples, Taburg grew mushrooms, various food crops, and hay. Apart from apples, he dealt in tree grafts and herbs. The farmers home was elevated above the ground on pilings, and underneath was the entrance to the extensive cellars used for mushroom farming. The farms herbs and local wildflowers were used in distilling a potent medicinal wine that possessed impressive pain-killing properties.\nLong before the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Shen family migrated to Cormyr from Durpar, by way of Chessenta. Tabards father was Thontravur Shen and mother â€“ Velveira Almarrand, a Sembian merchant noblewoman. Taburgs sister, Randarla Shen, was an adventuring sort who eventually met her end on Zhentarim blades, after joining Harpers. Taburg met and moon married Shalarla, a strong Dalesfolk, with whom they sired three daughters Haethe, Raedaerle, and Tarsarra.\nTaburg died first between the spouses. Shalarla outlived the man and survived well into her twilight years. Still, eventually, both were buried on the farm by the Shen daughters, who decided to stay unmarried and run the farm while aiding elves of Cormanthor against Zhents in their spare time."
