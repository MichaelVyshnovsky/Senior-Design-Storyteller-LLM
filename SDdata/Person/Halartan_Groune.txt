Halartan Groune was a wizard from a tiny hamlet northeast of Daerlun named Drelt, circa 1360 DR.
Halartan was obese from too much good living.
Halartan loved food and wine, to the point of gluttony.
Groune was a business partner with Endreth Molipher, a former pirate, and two other wizards, Orbel Mhaerouzan, and Gorstal Hammers.
Halartan agreed to bring monsters that he subdued and captured to Molipher on his island sanctuary of Storna in the Inner Sea. He also provided magical assistance to ensure the success of Moliphers Dark Dragon Hunts by implanting dreams of heroic monster-slaying while clients slept, which reinforced the spiel they were fed so that they believed they had actually defeated a dangerous creature.
As part of the agreement, Groune was allowed to use the island as a hideout or a place to store items he didnt want easily found.
