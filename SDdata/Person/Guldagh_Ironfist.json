        "Activities": "Guldagh was a notorious thug. Usually, he recruited criminals in [[Westgate]]'s dirtiest alleys and  marched them over [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] until they arrived in Anauroch, where they thieved incense from the [[D'tarig]]'s territory. Afterwards, Guldagh traded the incense with other merchants before returning. If followed by some enemies, Guldagh entered the [[Stonelands]], where rumors said he had a secret fortress."
