        "mainbody": "Guldagh Ironfist was one of the top independent incense traders in Anauroch. \nGuldagh was a notorious thug. Usually, he recruited criminals in Westgates dirtiest alleys and  marched them over Cormyr and Sembia until they arrived in Anauroch, where they thieved incense from the Dtarigs territory. Afterwards, Guldagh traded the incense with other merchants before returning. If followed by some enemies, Guldagh entered the Stonelands, where rumors said he had a secret fortress."
