        "mainbody": "Dahlia Sinfelle, originally known as Dahlia Syndalay, was a young elf originally in the service of Szass Tam in the 15 century DR. She later traveled for a time with Drizzt DoUrden and became his lover.\nDahlia was a beautiful, tall, blue-eyed elf with a head shaved clean but for a single braid of raven black and cardinal red locks, woven to run down the right side of her head. She wore a set of diamonds in her left ear (one for each of the lovers she had killed) and a set of sparkling studs in her right (for lovers she had yet to kill).\nLike many Thayans of the day, she tattooed her head with woad, a blue and purple dye, in a shape hinting at a hunting cat ready to pounce. However, she could also easily disguise herself to appear less striking. \nDahlia often wore a crimson gown that was sleeveless, backless and cut low in the front.\nDahlia was angry and bitter about her past. Her anger drove her to \"collect\" lovers with the intention to attack them when their relationship was over. She hoped that one day a lover would be successful at killing her, but if not, she was content to kill that lover and seek another one.\nDahlia hated snakes and spiders.\nDahlia Syndalay was raised in the Shakebrook Syndalay clan. When she was twelve years old, her village was attacked by the Netherese. Dahlia was raped by the Shadovar tiefling Herzgo Alegni, who also killed her mother. As a result of the violation, Dahlia gave birth to his child. After the child was born, she brought him to the top of a cliff near Alegnis camp. She called his name until Herzgo came to investigate the noise himself. Once he arrived, she threw the newborn off of the cliff.\nDahlia grew to be a fine warrior and entered into the service of Szass Tam of Thay, presumably so that she could continue to kill Shadovar in retaliation for the violation she suffered. In the 1450s DR, she was tasked by Sylora Salm with the release of the primordial within Gauntlgrym. She arranged for the drow Jarlaxle and his dwarf companion Athrogate, along with Valindra Shadowmantle, to accompany her and Korvin Dorcrae (her vampire lover) on the quest, luring the drow and dwarf with promised treasure. She later questioned her decision and tried to stop Athrogate from freeing the fire primordial but her efforts were made futile by Valindra Shadowmantle, Dorcrae, and Sylora. The primordial was released by Athrogates hand and caused the eruption of Mount Hotenow and the cataclysmic destruction of the city of Neverwinter. Dahlia was then forced to serve Sylora in Neverwinter Wood as punishment for her disobedience.\nAfter it was revealed that the primordial would rise again to strike the newly rebuilt Neverwinter, Dahlia abandoned the Thayan forces and allied herself with Jarlaxle, Drizzt DoUrden, and Bruenor Battlehammer, who had been recruited by Jarlaxle to aid in their quest, and together they journeyed to Gauntlgrym once more. One of Dahlias primary goals in this endeavor was to sabotage Syloras efforts in Neverwinter Wood so that Szass Tam would punish Sylora. The group successfully bound the primordial at the expense of Bruenors and Thibbledorf Pwents lives.\nthumb|250px|Dahlia Sinfelle versus Drizzt DoUrden in Gauntlgrym.\nAfter leaving Gauntlgrym, Dahlia and Drizzt set out to kill Sylora. They ran into Barrabus the Gray, who turned out to be Drizzts old nemesis Artemis Entreri who had been enslaved by the sword Charons Claw into the service of Herzgo Alegni and the Netherese. Entreri had been sent by Alegni to kill Dahlia, but opted to help her instead, since he didnt want to follow Alegnis orders and the Thayans were enemies of the Netherese anyway. The trio assaulted Ashenglade within the Dread Ring and killed Sylora.\nDahlia, having learned that Entreri was (unwillingly) serving her rapist, immediately set her eyes on killing Herzgo Alegni to avenge herself and her clan. The trio planned to return to Neverwinter to kill Alegni and to retrieve Charons Claw to release Entreri from enslavement. They attacked Alegni on a bridge in Neverwinter and thought him dead, but in reality he was able to escape to the Shadowfell with injuries that were promptly healed by clerics. They retrieved Charons Claw and planned to destroy it by casting it into the primordials pit in Gauntlgrym. Escaping the Netherese, who were seeking to retrieve Claw, and the drow forces of House Xorlarrin, the trio were able to destroy it.\nFollowing their adventures in Neverwinter, Dahlia traveled with Drizzt and his group of followers to Port Llast, which had been negatively affected during the Spellplague. After a year of defending the town and rebuilding and extending the seawall, the group traveled to Luskan to negotiate peace between the High Captains and the newly resettled Llast. During this time the drow had come to re involve themselves in the affairs in the City of Sails, and Drizzt and his companions were to set out on a freighter. Although told they would be coming for defence, the true purpose was to keep Drizzt away from Tiago Baenre.\nFollowing the arrival of the ship into Baldurs Gate, Dahlia was captured by her son Effron, now a capable warlock.  After several days as a prisoner, she was rescued by her companions and Effron was captured in turn. After several months at sea, mother and son began to bridge the gap created by Dahlias actions years before, and he eventually disclosed that Drizzts oldest companion, Guenhwyvar had been taken captive by a powerful Netherese warlock, Draygo Quick. Dahlia and Drizzts companions then accompanied Drizzt to the Shadowfell to rescue Guenhwyvar. However, the powerful Shadovar planned for their arrival and captured Drizzt and Effron, while transforming Dahlia and Entreri into stone. Several months later, Jarlaxle managed to free the companions and return Dahlia and Entreri to flesh again.\nDahlia accompanied the group north to Icewind Dale to stay away from Tiago Baenre, who was hunting Drizzt. Dahlia became increasingly displeased with Drizzt attempting to find evidence of Iruladoon, where hed previously heard his deceased wife and friends might be. When they stopped one night, the companions fell into a magical sleep that lasted eighteen years. When they awoke, Dahlia and the others wished to return south, but Drizzt had made the decision to break off their relationship, stating that his heart still belonged to Catti-brie. Dahlia, as was her habit, attacked her departing lover in hopes that he would kill her. Despite both knowing he was the better fighter, Drizzt was unable to bring himself to harm her, allowing Dahlia to inflict fatal injuries on the drow. Before she was able to finish him off, Entreri appeared and dragged her away. She headed south in the company of Artemis, Ambergris, Effron, and Afafrenfere as they headed south.\nIn 1484 DR, Dahlia was traveling with Artemis and their companions when they were attacked in Port Llast by a band of drow led by Tiago Baenre. She, Artemis, and Afafrenfere (believed dead) were captured and hung near the Forge in the new drow city of QXorlarrin erected in Gauntlgrym. Dahlia was mentally tortured by the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp.  She was encased with Kozahs Needle in webs over the altar to Lolth as an ornament in the chapel. When she awoke, she drew power from the altar and served as a proxy of Lolth (Kozahs Needle serving as a conduit to the mind of Lolth). She attacked Catti-brie (serving as the goddess Mielikkis proxy), who defeated her by collapsing a tunnel on top of her. She was believed dead, even by Artemis who opted to stay in Gauntlgrym, but in reality, Methil had used his psionic powers to save her life.\nAfter Methil saved her life, Dahlia was revived by Gromph and Quenthel Baenre on the altar of Lolth, whereupon Quenthel decreed her the new matron mother of the restored House DoUrden. She was not the matron mother in a practical sense, as she was insane and not aware of much. However, she lived in comfort, having plenty of time and nearly unlimited resources.\nBeing rescued from  Menzoberranzan by Drizzt, Jarlaxle and Entreri, Dhalia was helped by Kimmuriel to fix her broken mind. That proved to be a long and hard road, but she has her lovers support Artemis Entreri. She resides with Entreri in the ruins of Illusk, Bregan Daerthe HQ.\nDahlia carried a potent weapon known as Kozahs Needle which could switch forms between an eight-foot staff, two flails, a tri-staff, and a walking stick. \nDahlia also carried the Cloak of the Crow, an enchanted cloak that turned the wearer into a giant crow, which she took after slaying Borlann, a High Captain of Luskan. However, the cloak was later taken by Sylora Salm and only recovered again later by Dahlia after she and her companions defeated Sylora Salm.\nAfter the death of Bruenor Battlehammer at Gaunlgrym, Drizzt DoUrden and Dahlia traveled together and had a relatively short relationship. Drizzt, eager for a new path in life, found Dahlia and her exotic looks fascinating. She, on the other hand, viewed him as the lover that might actually succeed in killing her. She quite easily manipulated him with her looks, switching between what Drizzt termed the \"hard look\" and the \"soft look.\" The two had very different mindsets and Dahlia often mocked Drizzts noble goals and rose-tinted view of the world.\nWhen Artemis Entreri joined with Dahlia and Drizzt, Dahlia found a connection to him because of his experiences as a child, which in many ways were comparable to those she had experienced. Dahlia was the first person to whom Entreri had confided the horrors of his past. Dahlia became more and more drawn to him, sharing an intimacy with him that Drizzt knew was stronger than his own.\nAfter becoming matron mother of House DoUrden, Dahlia slept with Kimmuriel Oblodra, although she did not seem to be entirely aware of it and he viewed it only as a curious academic exercise."
