        "History": "Ghelvan was hired by Viceroy [[Erliza Daressin]] of [[Westphal]] on [[Snowdown]] to represent her, and by default [[Amn]]'s, interest in Kythyss. He led a group of mercenaries whom the townsfolk initially thought would offer protection, but quickly realized were there to exploit them. Ghelvan left most of the bureaucracy of running Kythyss to his lieutenants, but enjoyed making his presence known when dirty work needed to be done. During Kythyss's initial occupation, Ghelvan made examples of anyone refusing to bow to Amnian rule by murdering entire families."
