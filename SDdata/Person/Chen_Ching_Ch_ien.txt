Chen Ching Chien was a river spirit folk kensai in Cham Fau in Shou Lung in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Aside from her kensai practices with fellow student Ju Huo Wang at the Wang Ho School, Cheng Ching every morning swam and meditated at the Hungste River, a place that she had ties to as a spirit.
Chen Ching was very quiet and focused, a trait that helped her channeling her ki.
It was rumored that Ju Huo loved Chen Ching Chien, but she was turned off by his temper.
