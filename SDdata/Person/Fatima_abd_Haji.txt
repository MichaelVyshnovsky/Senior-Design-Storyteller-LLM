Fatima abd Haji, born Fatima bint Badia, was a human saluk who was kept captive by a noble efreeti around 1367 DR.
Fatima was an attractive woman with tan skin and black hair. She wore blue clothes and several pieces of jewelry, including a large pair of earrings, several bracelets and armbands, and a tiara.
She once attempted to rob the cave of the noble efreeti Haji, but was caught. As punishment, Haji imprisoned her by forcing her to wear a cursed bracelet that would magically return her to his cave if she wandered too far.
