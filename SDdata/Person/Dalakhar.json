        "History": "In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} Dalakhar was spying upon [[Renaer Neverember]], the estranged son of his master. At one point, however, Lord Dagult ordered many of his agents, including Dalakhar, to obtain the ''[[stone of Golorr]]'' from the lair of the [[Xanathar]]. The rock gnome managed to steal the stone, ruining a meeting between Xanathar and the [[Zhentarim]].\n\nLater, Dalakhar was targeted by agents of the Zhentarim, the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]], [[Bregan D'aerthe]], and others, making it impossible for him to get out of Waterdeep as planned.",
