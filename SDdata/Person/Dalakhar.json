        "mainbody": "Dalakhar was a thief and spy in Waterdeep working for Lord Dagult Neverember in the late 15 century DR.\nIn 1492 DR, Dalakhar was spying upon Renaer Neverember, the estranged son of his master. At one point, however, Lord Dagult ordered many of his agents, including Dalakhar, to obtain the stone of Golorr from the lair of the Xanathar. The rock gnome managed to steal the stone, ruining a meeting between Xanathar and the Zhentarim.\nLater, Dalakhar was targeted by agents of the Zhentarim, the Xanathars Thieves Guild, Bregan Daerthe, and others, making it impossible for him to get out of Waterdeep as planned.\nDalakhar was very loyal to his master, believing Dagult to be the rightful Open Lord of Waterdeep."
