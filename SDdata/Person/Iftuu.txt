Iftuu was a drow soldier involved in Vierna DoUrdens scheme to capture her brother, Drizzt DoUrden, in Mithral Hall.
In 1357 DR, Jarlaxle and his Bregan Daerthe helped Vierna DoUrden track down Drizzt with the aid of Artemis Entreri.
While on lookout for enemies, Iftuu encountered Thibbledorf Pwent who took a second to decide if the drow was actually Drizzt.
