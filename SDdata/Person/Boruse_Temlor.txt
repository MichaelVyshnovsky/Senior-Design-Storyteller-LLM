Boruse Temlor was the head cleric of Cyric at the Citadel of the Raven in 1367 DR. 
Boruse was a cold and remote individual. His main concern was maintaining faith in Cyric in the most remote outpost. Boruse had a passably good relationship with Kandar Milinal, but Kandar was contemptuous of Boruse for his lack of interest in plots and schemes.
