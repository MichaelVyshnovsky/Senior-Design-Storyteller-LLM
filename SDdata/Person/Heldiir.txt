Heldiir was a Zhentarim mage of the mid-14 century DR.
He was only old enough to master his nerves.
He was somewhat skittish.
In late , Manshoon ordered Heldiir to lead a group of twenty mages in keeping a magical watch over Shadowdale, with the purpose of ensuring Elminster and other notables did not undertake secret movements.
