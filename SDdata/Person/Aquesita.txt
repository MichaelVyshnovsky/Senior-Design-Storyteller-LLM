Lady '''Aquesita''' was the only living relative of [[Karsus]] during the [[Fall of Netheril]].

==Description==
Lady Aquesita was a woman of plain but distinctive appearance. She had a round face, with brown hair, and a blocky, barrel-like figure. Her features were not conventionally attractive, and she had pudgy hands. However, she was known for her genuine smile and the lack of heavy [[makeup]], setting her apart from the heavily adorned women and men of her time.

==Personality==
Aquesita was characterized by her intelligence, conscientiousness, and warmth. She preferred simplicity and authenticity, both in her personal style and in her interactions with others. Known for her sincerity, she had a strong sense of duty, and was deeply concerned with the well-being of her cousin, Karsus.

==Activities==
Sita kept herself busy by managing Karsus's estates and working with artists at the guild.

==Relationships==
{{Quote

Aquesita was the older cousin of Karsus and she referred to him by the nickname, "Karry".

She was enamored by the [[arcanist]], [[Candlemas]], and eventually came to fall in love with him.

==History==
Karsus's cousin lived in the 36{{th}} century [[NY]]. When Candlemas visited the enclave of Karsus, Lady Aquesita sent him a calling card, prompting him to meet her. During their encounter, Aquesita explained that she was Karsus's only living relative and expressed concern about his well-being, owing to his instability and genius. She requested that Candlemas keep her informed about Karsus's activities and thoughts, as she wanted to stay updated on her cousinâ€™s progress. Despite his initial hesitation, Candlemas agreed to help Aquesita.

Prior to the Fall of Netheril in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, Aquesita declared that she was in love with Candlemas. Candlemas tried to get her to travel back in time with him as Karsus was accumulating god-like power, but Aquesita believed her cousin would succeed. As Candlemas and his companions left, Aquesita ran over to her cousin, but he transformed into stone. The enclave began to plummet, and exploded.
