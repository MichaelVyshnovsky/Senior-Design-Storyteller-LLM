During their encounter, Aquesita explained that she was Karsuss only living relative and expressed concern about his well-being, owing to his instability and genius. She requested that Candlemas keep her informed about Karsuss activities and thoughts, as she wanted to stay updated on her cousinâ€™s progress. Despite his initial hesitation, Candlemas agreed to help Aquesita.
Prior to the Fall of Netheril in the , Aquesita declared that she was in love with Candlemas. Candlemas tried to get her to travel back in time with him as Karsus was accumulating god-like power, but Aquesita believed her cousin would succeed. As Candlemas and his companions left, Aquesita ran over to her cousin, but he transformed into stone. The enclave began to plummet, and exploded.
