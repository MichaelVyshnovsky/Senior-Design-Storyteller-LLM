'''Gragus''' was the Great Druid who governed a [[druid circle]] in [[Amn]], based in the northeast of [[Trademeet]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gragus' druidic circle from [[Tethyr]] fell under the sway of the [[Shadow Druid]] [[Faldorn]] and her aggressive ways, who ousted and replaced the Great Druid Gragus. Druids became cruel and hardened, dispensing nature's punishment to civilized people of the southern edges of [[Amn]].
