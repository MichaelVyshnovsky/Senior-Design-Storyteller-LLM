        "mainbody": "'''Gathen''', known as '''the Swiftsword''' and '''Gathen Swiftsword''', was a retired warrior and [[adventurer]] in the village and vale of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 13{{th}} or early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/54/The Everwinking Eye: Elminster's Guide to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|16-17}}{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}}",
        "History": "Over time, a number of ex-adventurers had retired to the vale, and occasionally they went to the nearby abandoned mage's tower known as [[Maskyr's Tower]] to try their luck on its wards, thinking they might find some heretofore undiscovered vulnerability. Yet its wards proved impenetrable, so they left with nothing. Finally, one of them, Gathen Swiftsword, had grown impatient with this over the years and resolved to take a brute-force approach. He rode to [[Mulmaster]] and returned with a 30-strong crew of hired 'strongarm' laborers whom he ordered to simply tunnel through the walls with bars, [[hammer]]s, and [[pick]]s.It is unknown when these events occur, but given that [[Khonduil Ammargath]] is still alive as of the late 1350s DR, it is presumed to be within his lifetime and thus somewhere in the late 13{{th}} century to early 14{{th}} centuries DR.\n\nAfter two days of effort, they'd made one breach and almost had a second. Impatient to begin, the Swiftsword donned his old armor and collected his old weapons, and headed inside. He was never seen again. In fact, in an upper level, Gathen encountered a [[gargoyle]]-like guardian monster that proceeded to rip his arms and legs off, and was later transformed into a [[dragon]]."
