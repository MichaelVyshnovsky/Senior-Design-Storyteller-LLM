        "mainbody": "Gathen, known as the Swiftsword and Gathen Swiftsword, was a retired warrior and adventurer in the village and vale of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the late 13 or early 14 century DR.\nOver time, a number of ex-adventurers had retired to the vale, and occasionally they went to the nearby abandoned mages tower known as Maskyrs Tower to try their luck on its wards, thinking they might find some heretofore undiscovered vulnerability. Yet its wards proved impenetrable, so they left with nothing. Finally, one of them, Gathen Swiftsword, had grown impatient with this over the years and resolved to take a brute-force approach. He rode to Mulmaster and returned with a 30-strong crew of hired strongarm laborers whom he ordered to simply tunnel through the walls with bars, hammers, and picks.It is unknown when these events occur, but given that Khonduil Ammargath is still alive as of the late 1350s DR, it is presumed to be within his lifetime and thus somewhere in the late 13 century to early 14 centuries DR.\nAfter two days of effort, theyd made one breach and almost had a second. Impatient to begin, the Swiftsword donned his old armor and collected his old weapons, and headed inside. He was never seen again. In fact, in an upper level, Gathen encountered a gargoyle-like guardian monster that proceeded to rip his arms and legs off, and was later transformed into a dragon."
