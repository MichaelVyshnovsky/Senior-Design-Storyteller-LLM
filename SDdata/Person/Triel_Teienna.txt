Triel Teienna was a drow priestess of Lolth who served as the High Priestess of the Temple of Lolth in Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She enjoyed indulging in opulent pleasures, and used her position within Bezanturs temple to engage in such pursuits.
While she was technically the overseer of Lolths temple in Bezantur, Triel only visited once every few months. Whenever she did, she would always select a handful of the human members of the congregation to accompany her back to the Underdark to "live" with their drow "brethren". Naturally, these chosen individuals they were never seen again.
