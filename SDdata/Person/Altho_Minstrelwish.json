        "History": "Around {{Yearlink|12}}, Altho traveled to the world of [[Earth]], most likely to the realm of [[Wikipedia:France|France]], and collected a number of [[fox]]es. He imported these foxes to [[Toril]], where he had plans to sell their fur (particularly their tails, termed \"brushes\") for fashionable attire, but found few halflings were interested because of their distinct smell. Fox meat, whether roasted or stewed, was even less popular.\n\nIn the end, Altho let the foxes run wild, thereby introducing foxes to [[Faerûn]], and in time they displaced the native Faerûnian [[lynx]]. This origin of foxes was remembered in the [[Halfling language|hin word]] for \"fox\", ''rennard'', after the French word for a fox, ''renard''.Foxes have appeared in earlier-set sources, such as in the time of [[Netheril]] in the novel ''[[Sword Play]]'', suggesting Altho was responsible for a different breed of fox or the reintroduction of foxes."
