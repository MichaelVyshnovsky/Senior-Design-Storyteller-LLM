'''The Maermadrar''' was an [[archmage]] of [[Sheirtalar]] in [[Lapaliiya]] of the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Stern and powerful, the Maermadrar had his own tower and a lot of apprentices. One of them was a rather obnoxious novice named Holbert Gruth, who one night stole two [[spellbook]]s and a small coffer filled with [[wand]]s, sneaked out of the tower, changed his name to [[Qilder Yarven]] and went into hiding in the [[Border Kingdoms]] to evade from the Maermadrar's anger. Some years later, in [[1317 DR]], Qilder briefly became the [[Magister]].
