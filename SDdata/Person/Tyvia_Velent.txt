==History==
At some point before the late 14{{th}} century DR, Silas came across a [[Thay]]vian slave. Her name was Tyvia Velent. Silas purchased her and granted her freedom. Subsequently, the two became lovers. Tyvia accompanied Silas on his business trips, including when trading spices with the [[Merchant House]] of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Tyvia Velent, her lover Silas Billmore, and his bodyguard, were guests of the [[Golden Goblet Inn]] in Mossbridges. The trio showed little interest in conversing with the locals nor paid any attention to traveling adventurers.
