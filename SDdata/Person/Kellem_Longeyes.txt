Kellem Longeyes was a beloved ranger and protector of the Ten-Towns from the settlement of Bremen in Icewind Dale, active some time before the early 14 century DR.
In his long career, the grizzled ranger traversed the cold lands of the Savage North in the endless pursuit of wyverns, drakes, and other wyrms. He often focused on those wyrms who directly threatened the Ten-Town or smaller neighboring settlements and used the surrounding lands as their hunting grounds. Eventually, all of Kellem Longeyes gear became adorned with trophies collected from the numerous slain draconic creatures.
One such trophy came from Frostmaw, a white wyrm whose size and ferocity could match a true white dragon. The fierce between Kellem and Frostmaw took the rangers left eye and ear, burned off in the wyrms icy breath. These disfigurements made Kellem swear vengeance on all of Frostmaws cursed ilk. The head of the white wyrm soon after was fashioned into an elaborate enchanted helm he called Wyrms Maw. The helmet was imbued with Frostmaws deadly frigid breath.
Many years later, aged Kellem Longeyes embarked on the one last hunt into the spires of the Spine of the World and never returned. In the , Kellems helmet â€“ Wyrms Maw, was recovered from a nest of two white dragons and their white wyrms, in the River Caves, just south of the Spine of the World, from whence the Black Raven River began and  ran south across the Cold Marshes.
