        "mainbody": "aladrex was an especially vain and prideful red dragon.\nHe was old enough that he considered a few years to be a minuscule amount of time.\nSaladrex viewed himself in the most grandiose terms. He enjoyed being referred to by various honorifics and was not above responding well to flattery.\nHe would refer to humanoid adventurers as \"puny\".\nHe had a particularly desirable hoard, which was sought after by many adventurers. Among his treasures was the Staff of the Ram, a unique staff of striking.\nSome time during the 1360s DR, Saladrex made his lair within the 4 level of the Watchers Keep. He was summoned to the keep by the \"Lord of the Level\" Carston, by means of the Machine of Lum the Mad.\nSaladrex remained within the keep because of the amusement he found in Carstons antics. He was particularly delighted by the endless battle fought by the githyanki and illithids who each had encampments nearby."
