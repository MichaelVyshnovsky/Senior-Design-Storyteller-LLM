        "Description": "He was old enough that he considered a few years to be a minuscule amount of time.",
        "Personality": "Saladrex viewed himself in the most grandiose terms. He enjoyed being referred to by various honorifics and was not above responding well to flattery.\n\nHe would refer to humanoid [[adventurer]]s as \"puny\".",
        "Possessions": "He had a particularly desirable hoard, which was sought after by many adventurers. Among his treasures was the ''[[Staff of the Ram]]'', a unique ''[[staff of striking]]''.",
        "History": "Some time during the 1360s [[DR]], Saladrex made his lair within the 4{{th}} level of the [[Watcher's Keep]]. He was summoned to the keep by the \"Lord of the Level\" [[Carston]], by means of the [[Machine of Lum the Mad]].\n\nSaladrex remained within the keep because of the amusement he found in Carston's antics. He was particularly delighted by the endless battle fought by the [[githyanki]] and [[illithid]]s who each had encampments nearby."
