Xhalph DlardragethHis full name is confirmed in the glossary at the end of Forsaken House. was a half-fiend member of the daemonfey.
His skin was olive green and heavily scaled in parts, especially his pointed ears, made more prominent by his baldness. Xhalth had six arms, having inherited the four arms of his father, and had a stronger build than any human. He disdained covering his heavily muscled body, thinking his form would better intimidate his enemies when seen.
He was reported to be either the offspring of Countess Sarya Dlardrageths twin brother Khuumal and a marilith, a cousin to Ryvvik, or the son of Sarya herself and a glabrezu.
He once hatched a plot to unseat Sarya and lead the organization himself, but after learning that she had killed her own son Ryvvik, he wisely reconsidered.
After killing Seiveril Miritar in Myth Drannor in the last battle of the Cormanthor War, he alongside most of the remaining feyri tried to escape inside the Waymeet but at last was killed fighting Fflar Starbrow Melruth.
Xhalth wielded the Blade Dlardrageth and Khuumals baldric.
