'''Xhalph Dlardrageth'''<ref group="note">His full name is confirmed in the glossary at the end of ''[[Forsaken House]]''. was a [[half-fiend]] member of the [[daemonfey]].

==Description==
His skin was olive green and heavily scaled in parts, especially his pointed ears, made more prominent by his baldness. Xhalth had six arms, having inherited the four arms of his father, and had a stronger build than any [[human]]. He disdained covering his heavily muscled body, thinking his form would better intimidate his enemies when seen.{{cite book/Forsaken House|54}}

==Relatives==
He was reported to be either the offspring of Countess [[Sarya Dlardrageth]]'s twin brother [[Khuumal Dlardrageth|Khuumal]] and a [[marilith]], a cousin to [[Ryvvik Dlardrageth|Ryvvik]], or the son of Sarya herself and a [[glabrezu]].

==Activities==
He once hatched a plot to unseat Sarya and lead the organization himself, but after learning that she had killed her own son [[Ryvvik Dlardrageth|Ryvvik]], he wisely reconsidered.

==History==
After killing [[Seiveril Miritar]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in the last battle of the [[Cormanthor War]], he alongside most of the remaining fey'ri tried to escape inside the [[Waymeet]] but at last was killed fighting [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]].

==Equipment==
Xhalth wielded the ''[[Blade Dlardrageth]]'' and ''[[Khuumal's baldric]]''.
