The man only remembered by the name '''Raymond''' was a Duke from the town of [[Delthuntle]] in [[Aglarond]] sometime before [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Duke Raymond lived sometime after Delthuntle's founding ''circa'' {{Yearlink|1170}} and before {{Yearlink|1368}}. For several years, the man was locked in a bitter rivalry with the Duke of [[Spandeliyon]], [[Edwall Dest]]. Eventually, their antagonism reached its pinnacle in a shooting competition. The winner of the competition was to be declared the superior archer between the two. Dukes Raymond and Edwall both wielded powerful [[enchanted]] [[bow]]s. But Raymond's weapon, later known as ''[[Dead Shot]]'', was stolen by the Duke of Spandeliyon before the competition. Edwall entered the shooting match confident in his advantage, exulting in his inevitable victory. However, Duke Raymond planned a surprise of his own. He demanded his opponent demonstrate his proficiency in sharpshooting on a scarecrow that bore an eerie resemblance to Edwall Dest himself. The Duke of Spandeliyon aimed and sent an [[arrow]] straight at the dummy's head. He did not miss and split the target's head in two. At the same time as the [[effigy|poppet]]'s head split, so did Duke Dest's.
