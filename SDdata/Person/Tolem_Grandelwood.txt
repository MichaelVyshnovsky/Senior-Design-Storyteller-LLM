{{quote|''Hello? How's the weather in the dungeon? Ha! I made a joke! Ha!''|Tolem Grandelwood}}

==Posessions==
Tolem owned a masterfully-crafted [[sword]] forged and triple-[[enchanted]] by the legendary Master Smith [[Gerzan]] of [[Delzoun]].

==Relationships==
[[Colvin Rowander]] was a part of Tolem's adventuring party in 1370 DR.

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Tolem could be found in the [[Yawning Portal]] of [[Waterdeep]], making wagers against reckless fellow adventurers entering the [[Undermountain]]. He offered bets of 100 [[gp]] that the individual was to perish before reaching the mega dungeon's second level. Upon their death, he would collect gold off the loser's next of kin. This source of income was semi-successful as not all adventurers that accepted the wager lost it. Tolem Grandelwood made the same bet with the lone hero sent to investigate the recent [[kobold]] activity by [[Khelben Arunsun]].

At one point of his adventures in Undermountain, Tolem was able to infiltrate the [[Tomb of Ankh-Kephra]], survive its perilous traps, find a hidden treasure vault, and replaced the booty with a scroll proclaiming himself being there first.
