        "mainbody": "Othmar bin Jaqal was a shair who lived in Mahabba of the Pantheist League in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nOthmar bound an efreeti named Zet into his service. He belittled Zet at any opportunity and generally treated him poorly. \nIn addition to being the caliphs trusted judge, Othmar was also his chief spymaster.\nOthmar was known for burning heretics who opposed the Pantheon.\nOthmar was suspected of being affiliated with the Brotherhood of the True Flame. In truth he was a devoted Pantheist and wanted only to cleanse heresy with purifying flame."
