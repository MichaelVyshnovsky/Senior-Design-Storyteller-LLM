'''Twinkin''' was a fearless and loyal secretary and assistant of Mayor [[Wilsey]] of [[Liam's Hold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Twinkin was a diminutive [[Hin]] woman with short red hair. She wore dark blue finery and a triangle head scarf the same color. She was busy and effective at her job, and prideful of her superior organizational skills.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Twinkin spent most of her time at the mayor's house, aiding her with running the hamlet and making sure no visitors snuck past her without an appointment.

Sometime in the early fall of 1372 DR, an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]], [[Astriel Shalyn]], worked alongside the [[Hero of Daggerford]] in investigating strange occurrences surrounding the "death" of [[Pwyll Daggerford]]. After fleeing from Daggerford, Astriel spent time in Liam's Hold, mingling with locals in order to become liked by the locals. When time was right, she tricked secretary Twinkin to run to [[Nell's Pie Shop]] to pick up [[bread]]s that the Mayor, allegedly, asked for. While the Mayor's home was unattended, Astriel made an impression of the key to the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]] and returned it back to Wilsey's desk. This trickery gave her access to the abandoned temple, a safe house while she waited for the Hero of Daggerford to claim the keep for themselves.
