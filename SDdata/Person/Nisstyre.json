        "mainbody": "Nisstyre was a drow wizard and leader of the merchant band Dragons Hoard in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nNisstyre was thin, with a sharp-featured face, elegantly pointed ears, and a mane of unusual copper-colored hair that he normally put up in a ponytail.\nHe carried no weapons, having the ability to use magic instead.\nNisstyre was very cunning and shrewd, which was a necessity for being the male leader of an independent group in drow society.\nNisstyre had many contacts on the surface, where he was known as the Fox.\nNisstyre was originally from Ched Nasad, where he was trained as a wizard. He disliked having to serve the matriarchy of his homeland, and in his explorations he found the worship of the drow god of rogues, Vhaeraun. He left and formed his own independent merchants group secretly devoted to the glory of Vhaeraun and the expansion of drow settlement on the surface.\nIn the , Nisstyres band went to Rashemen to obtain magical artifacts from the Red Wizard Merdrith. They ran into Fyodor, who had stolen the Windwalker amulet, which had been in Merdriths possession. Nisstyre took the Windwalker from him and attempted to bring it back to Menzoberranzan, but his party was attacked and killed by deep bats and the Windwalker was lost. Nisstyre soon learned that Liriel Baenre had found the Windwalker, so he attempted to retrieve it with the help of Shakti Hunzrin, who placed a ruby scrying gem into his forehead to further communication. In the end, Nisstyre was not able to capture Liriel rather, she was able to assist the followers of Eilistraee from the Promenade of the Dark Maiden in assaulting and effectively destroying the Dragons Hoard base in Skullport.\nNisstyre was acquainted with Kharza-kzad Xorlarrin, to whom he provided spellbooks and forbidden books from the surface. He was also the one who attacked Kharza-kzad, prompting the latter to use a wand of lichdom to turn himself into a lich to escape.\nNisstyres son was Gorlist, who apparently inherited leadership of the remnants of Dragons Hoard.\nAmong the spells he was capable of were dispel magic, fireball, reveal magic, and frostbind."
