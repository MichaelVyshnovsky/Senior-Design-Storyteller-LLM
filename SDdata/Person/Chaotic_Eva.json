        "mainbody": "haotic Eva, also known as Mother, was a drag queen famous for performing at the Pink Flumph theater in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nShe was a celebrated and game performer who inspired others to pursue careers as drag queens, and it was for this that she earned the nickname \"Mother\".\nShe was known to put on two shows a day, if not three on occasion. In her efforts to avoid being either hungry or sober while on stage, she invented a concoction of tomato, vodka, oyster, and spices. The drink was subsequently sold to the public at the Pink Flumph, and while some were hesitant to try it, most who did enjoyed it.\nAmong the drag queens she had inspired&mdashher \"children\"&mdashwere Gary Ooze, Halflina, and Misty Step."
