Uponga Naodha was a captain of the guard of Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
During the events of the death curse, Captain Naodha expressed interest to the Master of the Market about outfitting his subordinates in breastplate armor from the Sword Coast. While he understood that the Chultan heat made such armor impractical, he had also grown frustrated with how vulnerable the guards were when faced with the monsters of the jungle. His solution was to commission a foreign smith to craft titansteel armor for him.
