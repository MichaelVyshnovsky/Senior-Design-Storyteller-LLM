'''Varytha Ithal''', known as "'''the Harbinger'''", was a [[half-elf]] from [[Clan Ithal]] who helped unify—for a time—the [[human]]s and [[elves]] of [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Varytha was the daughter of Chieftain [[Corin Ithal]] and his elven bride [[Shyllisyrr Ithal|Shyllisyrr]], who was from the [[Forest of Tethir]].

Varytha married into the [[Suldusk]] tribe of elves when she joined with Prince [[Quynn Goldengrove]].

==History==
Around the year {{Yearlink|-190}}, as a teen-aged girl, Varytha mysteriously vanished, and neither [[ranger]]s nor [[mage]]s could track her whereabouts. Unbeknownst to her parents, she had fled [[human]] life to live among her mother's people to learn their ways.

In {{Yearlink|-173}}, in late spring, Varytha suddenly appeared again to Clan Ithal, and she brought with her grave warnings of rising [[goblin]] populations. Her warning and her efforts to reconcile the tense relations between the two sides of her family led to victory against the goblins, and she even served as an advance scout throughout this time. Her later marriage to a prince of the Suldusk elves further tightened ties between the two races of men and elves.
