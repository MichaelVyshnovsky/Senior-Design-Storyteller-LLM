        "Possessions": "Tural was given his grandfather's sword as a gift from his father.",
        "History": "In 1370 DR, he decided to head off to join Tethyr's new army at [[Riatavin]]. On [[Uktar 10]], the morning before he was to leave, his father Tadaz went with Tural and Tadaz's best friend [[Ondar]] to the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in order to send him off. Tural, however, was more interested in the barmaid, [[Skie]].\n\nThat night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]''. When [[Bramas Thorntree]] accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Tural was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers."
