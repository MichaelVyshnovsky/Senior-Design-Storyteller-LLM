        "mainbody": "Tural was a young inhabitant of the village of Toralth in Tethyr in 1370 DR.\nTural looked almost exactly like a younger version of his father Tadaz. He was left-handed.\nTural was given his grandfathers sword as a gift from his father.\nIn 1370 DR, he decided to head off to join Tethyrs new army at Riatavin. On Uktar 10, the morning before he was to leave, his father Tadaz went with Tural and Tadazs best friend Ondar to the Blue Badger Inn in order to send him off. Tural, however, was more interested in the barmaid, Skie.\nThat night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter. When Bramas Thorntree accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Tural was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers."
