'''Teskulladar''', also known as '''Manytalons''', was a [[silver dragon]].

==History==
In [[947 DR]], Teskulladar killed the [[white dragon]] [[Cortulorrulagalargath]] in a battle above the realm of [[Calandor]], indirectly causing the deaths of the Duke of Calandor and his retinue when the defeated Cortulorrulagalargath fell upon [[Delimbiyran]].<ref name=GHR>

Teskulladar eventually met and fell in love with the [[song dragon]] [[Essembramaerytha]]. After they married, they traveled together across the [[Dalelands]] for many years until the day both disappeared without a trace. There were many legends about what fate befell the two dragons, but the truth was that they simply retired to live in [[Evermeet]].
