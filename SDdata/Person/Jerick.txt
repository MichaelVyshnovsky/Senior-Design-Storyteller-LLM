'''Jerick''' was a shepherd from the [[Wild Pastures]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

{{quote|''Listen, these eyes have watched over a thousand [[cattle]] and until now I've lost less than a dozen, and them to ferocious [[giant bear]]s and the one time a passing [[roc]]. It's not possible to just walk up and steal one. There be something strange at work, and that's for sure.''|Jerick the Shepherd}}

==Description==
Jerick was a lean [[human]] male with skin tanned by spending his days on a pasture. The shepherd wore simple clothes and carried his trusty [[spear]].

==Relationships==
Jerick young son worked with him as a shepherd. And [[Hevesar Dimpet]] was his brother in law.

==Activities==
Jerick lived a life of hard labor and danger. He used the Wild Pastures for its abundant grass and defended his cattle from [[wolves]] and [[troll]]s of the [[Trollbark Forest]] with a spear and his son's [[crossbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Wild Pastures west of [[Liam's Hold]] hamlet began experiencing uncanny disappearances of cattle, sometimes in the middle of the day. Jerick's beasts were affected by the happenings, and he was happy when [[Hevesar Dimpet]], the representative of local shepherds, sent a word to [[Daggerford]]'s guard. The city asked the adventurer lair known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to investigate. Jerick and his son were among the shepherds the adventurer interviewed as a part of his investigation. The disappearances were revealed to be a band of [[goblin]]s armed with a magic brew who served the [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]].

When the Hero dispatched a band of Gorgomorz's orcs moving from Trollbark Forest to the caves under cover of the night, the orcs retaliated by capturing several shepherds of the pastures, including Jerick, his son rushed to uncle Hevesar for help, and the Hero of Daggerford was forced to venture into the caves to rescue the captives. Subsequently, Jerick was found alive and returned to his family.
