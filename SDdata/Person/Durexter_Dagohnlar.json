        "mainbody": "'''Durexter Dagohnlar''' was a merchant from [[Marsember]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The man was overweight, and often had bad breath because of his taste for [[spice|spicy]] food.",
        "Personality": "He liked [[garlic]] and [[Thayan pepper]]. According to his wife, he was a brute, a boor, and thoroughly dishonest.",
        "Possessions": "He owned a large home on [[Calathanter Street]], three blocks away from [[Haelithtorntowers]], where many servants worked. In his bedroom, which had a tiled floor, the large bed had a high canopy of [[rubyweave]] draperies, bedposts, [[silk]]en sheets, cushions; there was a [[glass]]-fronted wardrobe with frilled lovegowns and [[robe]]s, a footstool, a chest-of-blankets that smelled of [[moth-powder]]. As of the early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, their room also sported a new [[Athkatla]]n rug, thick and fur-like. Their bedroom window opened directly over the canal. He was wealthy enough that he could afford to rip one of his wife's robes in an adventurous act of ardor.\n\nThe servants' quarters had peep-panels on the doors. The bedroom was upstairs, separated from the ground floor by at least three flights of stairs; the stair leading to the front door was in a room with a vaulted ceiling, where a crown-of-[[candle]]s [[chandelier]] hung close to the top flight of stairs. Between the top flight and the middle flight of stairs was at least one [[copper]] pot with ring-handles, on which a [[fern]] grew. Between the middle flight of stairs and the last one closest to the front doors, there was an ancestral Dagohnlar set of decorative [[armor]].",
        "Activities": "Durexter was a merchant of ill repute. He made it a point to avoid dealings with even more disreputable merchants.",
        "Relationships": "Durexter was married to [[Starmara Dagohnlar]].",
        "History": "At some point before the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Durexter Dagohnlar had swindled two other Marsemban merchants, [[Aumon Tholant Bezrar]] and [[Malakar Surth]], of a large sum by reneging on his obligations in an illicit deal, confident they would not have recourse from anyone else. They invaded his home one night in the early spring of that year, quickly binding and gagging him and his wife while they were otherwise occupied in their bedroom.\n\nWhile they were bound, the thief [[Narnra Shalace]] burst in through their bedroom window trying to escape the [[Harper]] [[Glarasteer Rhauligan]], in hot pursuit of her. He vociferously denied to his captors that those two were hired by him; it didn't matter, as they tried to fight Glarasteer, only to be quickly defeated.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|107-109|7}} Nobody rescued him and his wife, however, leaving them to try and chew through the bindings.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|111-114|7}}\n\nPast morning{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|116-117|7}} he was not done chewing through the bindings. He was later visited by the local watch, but adamantly refused to reveal anything about the matter to the captain, a watchman with a grizzled moustache. He was gagged and taken from the room for that, almost certainly for questioning.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|135-136|8}}"
