Empress '''Ususi Manaallin''' was a [[Deep Imaskari]] [[wizard]], the ruler of [[High Imaskar]] in [[1479 DR]] and a former adventurer.

==Appearance==
In 1373 DR, Ususi had skin like marble criscrossed by something akin to mineral veins, with hair and eyes of coal black color.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|58}}{{cite book/Darkvision|295|30}}

As of 1479 DR, Empress Ususi was a frail and weak old woman. Despite her age, she was warm and benevolent.

==Powers==
As a wizard, Ususi had, even before reaching the surface, weakened the Great Seal of [[Deep Imaskar]] while fleeing the city.{{cite book/Darkvision|58|6}}

During her quest for the [[Mucklestones]] in 1373 DR, Ususi displayed a number of feats of sorcery, including her mastery of the ''[[Keystone]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|94-95|11}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|263|28}} and the use of spells similar to ''[[Aganazzar's scorcher]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|192|19}} ''[[burning hands]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|150|15}} ''[[light]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|179-180}} ''[[fireball]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|80|9}} ''[[lightning bolt]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|82|9}}{{cite book/Lady of Poison|258|27}} ''[[magic missile]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|265|28}} and ''[[passwall]]''.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|254|27}}

She used different spells while looking for an entrance to the [[Celestial Nadir]] in 1374, most likely including ''[[color spray]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|126|13}} ''[[stoneskin]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|158|17}} ''[[shocking grasp]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|127|13}}, ''[[wall of ice]]'' followed by ''[[hold person]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|220|23}} ''[[wall of stone]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|274|28}} ''[[gust of wind]]'' and ''[[wall of force]]''.{{cite book/Darkvision|294-295|30}}  Ususi had been thwarted while trying to use a few spells she thought to employ against [[Shaddon Datharathi]], whose crystal flesh could not be pierced by weapons and showed little response to most magic. Those spells included one that hurled words of ineptitude (possibly ''[[power word, maladroit]]''), one that created a vortex tossing its target into the air, and an otherwise undescribed one which she knew as the ''decomposition of [[Umyatin]]''.{{cite book/Darkvision|219|23}} Ususi also knew a spell similar to ''[[find traps]]''{{cite book/Darkvision|52-54|6}} and had created several magical tools,{{cite book/Darkvision|53|6}}

She also gained her sister's percipience in 1374, allowing her to pierce [[Pandorym]]'s darkness.{{cite book/Darkvision|286-287|29}}

==Possessions==
In 1373, Ususi carried on her person a scroll of ''[[disintegrate]]'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|82-83|9}} and the ''[[Wand of Citrine Force]]''.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|144|14}} She was granted the ''[[Keystone]]'' by the [[Nentyarch]] that year.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|130|13}}

While exploring [[Imaskari]] ruins in [[Veldorn]] and [[Estagund]] along the way to [[Vaelan]] between [[Mirtul 19]] of 1373 and [[Tarsakh]] of 1374, Ususi crafted a number of tools for herself, including her ''[[Delver's orb]]'', its bound ''[[uskura]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|13-14|2}} a number of potions,{{cite book/Darkvision|91|8}} and the device that summoned horselike constructs to pull her coach wagon.{{cite book/Darkvision|14|2}}

In 1374 DR, Ususi employed a number of ''[[potions of healing]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|163-164|17}} a ''[[sunburst]]'' scroll,{{cite book/Darkvision|162|17}} and a potion of a divination spell, presumably ''[[identify]]''.{{cite book/Darkvision|52, 55, 57|6}} a stone fragment from an Imaskari tablet,{{cite book/Darkvision|17|2}} and a copy of the ''[[Writ of Adama]]''.{{cite book/Darkvision|248|26}}

==History==
Ususi was originally a wizard of [[Deep Imaskar]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison||6}} She had left the city at some point on or before {{yearlink|1363}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|12}}

===The Mucklestones===
Around 1363, Ususi Manaallin set up her residence at [[Two Stars]] in [[Thesk]] along the Golden Way, where she studied the [[Mucklestones]].{{cite book/Darkvision|12}} She was friends with a druid by the name of [[Briartan]] and a half-elf ranger, [[Elowen]]. In the Spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, when the ranger arrived at her door with the priest [[Marrec]], Ash, a mysterious young woman, and the Osslander [[Gunggari Ulmarra]] in tow, she accepted their help to visit the Mucklestones in person, so as to determine why she could not contact Briartan nor scry on the Mucklestones.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||6}}

At the Mucklestones, they encountered Briartan mutilated by the blightlord [[Gameliel]], who she attacked and slew.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||9}} Afterwards, she accepted the dying druid's request to report directly to the Nentyarch, then at [[Yeshelmaar]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison||10}} In order to speed up their journey, Ususi used a keystone taken from the blightlord to access a pathway through the [[Celestial Nadir]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison||11}}

At [[Yeshelmaar]], a turncoat elf by the name of [[Fallon]] kidnapped Ash and used her keystone to open a pathway through the Celestial Nadir towards the Arches of Xenosi in the [[Dunwood|Rawlinswood]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison||13}} The group quickly followed Fallon through the Nadir, only to be ambushed by the blightlord [[Anammelech]] at the Arches, against whom they prevailed.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||15}} They pursued Fallon's track into the Narfell ruins underneath the Rawlinswood.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||18}}

While in the ruins, they fought the demon Eschaar for the controlling token of the [[Queen Abiding]], a demon bound by the ancient Nar.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||25}} Acquiring the key, they moved on to fight a third blightlord, a vampire named [[Damanda]]. After slaying all of her minions, they were faced with the full forces of the [[Rotting Man]], which were only brought down by the intervention of the Queen Abiding, called upon by the priest Marrec against Ususi's protests.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||29}} They faced the Rotting Man in person shortly after; he was accompanied by the vampire Damanda, who revealed she had dominated Ususi during their last encounter. She turned on her companions, to be saved by Ash suddenly revealing herself to be a manifestation of [[Lurue]], Marrec's goddess, and forcing the Rotting Man to flee the fight.{{cite book/Lady of Poison||30}}

===Resealing of Pandorym===
In spring of {{yearlink|1374}} Ususi had been on the road for a year after having parted ways with Marrec's group, searching for other pathways into the Celestial Nadir. She had come across a sample of [[plangent|Celestial Nadir Crystal]] in a jewelry store at [[Two Stars]], spurring her back into the search.{{cite book/Darkvision|12}} The [[Imaskari vengeance taker]] [[Iahn Qoyllor]] joined her on the road to request she return to [[Deep Imaskar]], which was under siege from the [[Underdark]]. He revealed that the key to defeating them lay within the Celestial Nadir; she proposed they continue towards [[Vaelan]], where she determined another access to the Celestial Nadir might have been found.

On Vaelan, they encountered people whose limbs were prosthetics of [[plangent|Celestial Nadir crystal]]; looking into it, they came across [[Datharathi#Eined Datharathi|Eined Datharathi]], then in hiding, who helped them enter the mine. In the mine, they met the wizard [[Datharathi#Shaddon Datharathi|Shaddon Datharathi]]. After they determined that Shaddon had released the [[Elder Evil]] [[Pandorym]], the wizard slew Eined; unable to defeat him, they escaped through a nearby entrance into the Celestial Nadir. In the Nadir, they met with [[Datharathi#Warian Datharathi|Warian Datharathi]] and his uncle Zeltaebar, who had fled into it too. After performing funeral rites for Eined, the four of them found an entrance to the [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], where they believed Pandorym's mind was to be sealed.

The [[elf]] [[Kiril Duskmourn]] and the [[elemental]] [[Prince Monolith]] rescued the group from a trap, and joined them. A second trap placed all of them in impenetrable darkness; she learned there that her sister, [[Qari Manaallin]], was actually herself cleaved in two through Pandorym's meddling in the timeline. Qari granted her the sight she needed to penetrate Pandorym's darkness, allowing her to bypass the trap. Together, all six people entered the Imperial Weapons Cache, and managed to keep the mind of [[Pandorym]] imprisoned.

===Founding of High Imaskar===
When the threat had been dealt with, many of the younger Imaskari of Deep Imaskar left with Ususi to support the growth of High Imaskar.

After the [[Spellplague]], the wizard Ususi relocated the old [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]] to the barren [[Mulhorand]]i lands and founded the city of [[Skyclave]] and the nation of High Imaskar. She was crowned empress and her first mandate was to renounce the slavery of her ancestors, outlawing slave ownership on pain of death. She also set up the [[Body of Artificers, Planners, and Apprehenders]], whose power was equal to and balanced hers.

In 1479 DR, as she was old and infirm, she asked the Body of Artificers, Planners, and Apprehenders to look for a worthy successor.

In the same year, the [[paladin]] [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], the warrior [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]], and wizard [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]] from [[Tymanther]], as well as [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]], sought out Empress Ususi to ask for aid against [[Tchazzar]] and the invading [[Chessenta]]n army. In exchange, they offered their aid in destroying the [[blue dragon]] [[Gestaniius]]. Empress Ususi gladly accepted the offer, as Gestaniius was raiding High Imaskari lands.
