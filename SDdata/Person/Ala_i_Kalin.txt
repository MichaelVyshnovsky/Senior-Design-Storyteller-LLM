Alai Kalin was a member of the Riders of Blood in 1367 DR.
Originally from Huzuz, Alais father was accused as being a traitor to the Grand Caliph and beheaded. He viewed the Grand Caliphs actions as an abuse of justice and carried deep hatred for the man ever since that day.
Alai used his magical abilities on raids against caravans traveling along Dihl al-Taif. He delighted in slaying as many living targets as possible, a behavior that often earned him scoldings from Fasim Kaldur who saw the value of keeping the caravan animals alive.
Alais older brother was Mamood Kalin.
