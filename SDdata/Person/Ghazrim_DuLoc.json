        "mainbody": "'''Ghazrim DuLoc''' was the [[Zhentarim]]'s main representative in [[Mantol-Derith]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Ghazrim was born to a wealthy family in [[Amn]]. In later life, he joined the Zhentarim and was appointed as their representative in the crucial garrison of Mantol-Derith.\n\n''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], he was the only bulwark against the chaos spreading in the trading post, with [[duergar]] and [[deep gnome]]s making war on each other and the [[drow]] ready to seize total control of the place. However, the drow representative [[Sirak Mazelor]] needed Ghazrim's approval of her plan in order to act.",
        "Personality": "Ghazrim had the typically smarmy demeanor of the Amnian aristocracy coupled with a biting sense of humor that he used to diffuse tense situations. He liked a good battle but not with superior enemy troops.",
        "Relationships": "Ghazrim had with [[Lorthuun]], the leading [[beholder]] of the garrison, a relationship like that of a married couple, bickering and insulting each other but knowing both were loyal to the Black Network.",
        "Possessions": "Ghazrim possessed a very rare magical [[gold]] [[ring]] fitted with a [[star ruby]] that could guide the ring's wearer along the safest and shortest route to [[Gravenhollow]]."
