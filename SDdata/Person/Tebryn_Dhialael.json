        "Description": "Tebryn's skin was not as dark as a normal [[drow]]'s but enough to betray his origin, as did his white hair. Contrary to this, his blue eyes were clearly a gift from his human parent. He had a strong and slender build like most half-elves.",
        "History": "Tebryn was born into slavery in the [[Underdark]] drow city of [[Sschindylryn]]. His opportunity to escape came when a [[duergar]] army from [[Underspires]] attacked the mining outpost where he toiled. The outpost was destroyed and Tebryn killed his masters and fled. He emerged from the Underdark in the tunnels under [[Westgate]] and lived as a thief.\n\nTebryn accidentally discovered the [[Lair of the Night Masters]] and stole some items from there. Discovering the theft, [[Manshoon|Orbakh]] and [[Dahlia Vhammos]] easily caught Tebryn.  He became the last vampire slave of Orbakh and the last victim of the ''[[Winged Teeth]]'' artifact. Tebryn was considered a perfect fit as master of the guild's thieves. Thanks to his magic and vampiric powers, he walked unseen on the streets of the city.\n\nTebryn greatly enjoyed his new life and the power that he had. Most of the lower members of the guild suspected him to be the [[Faceless]].\n\nAfter the desctruction of the Night Masks Tebryn took refuge himself among the [[Zhentarim]] until Orbakh ordered him to went back to Westgate. There Tebryn under the name Kirenkirsalai infiltrated the [[shou]] thievesâ€™ guild of the [[Nine Golden Swords]] becoming one of their nine leaders.<ref>{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate}}\n\nAround [[1475 DR]] Kire directed the Nine Golden Swords against the [[Fire Knives]] crippling their power and under orders of Orbakh he re-estabilished the Night Masks' control over the city with him as new boss.<ref>{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate}}\n\nLater on, he bcame obsessed with the young [[mage]] [[Myrin Darkdance]]{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5316}}<ref group=\"note\">There are strong hints given in ''[[Eye of Justice (novel)|Eye of Justice]]'' that Kire is actually Myrin's father although the relationship is never stated explicitly. and was the person behind the bounty for her capture in [[Luskan]].{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5712}} In [[1480 DR]], Kire enlisted the help of [[Vaelis]], a young [[paladin]] of [[Hoar]] and one of the claimants to the [[Shadowbane]] title, and also had [[Eye of Justice]] member [[Hessar]] in his employ.",
        "Relationships": "Kire was obsessed with Myrin although the nature of his interest was never clear. It may have been related to family ties to [[House Darkdance]]{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|5345}} or may have been due to Myrin's powerful [[spellscar]]."
