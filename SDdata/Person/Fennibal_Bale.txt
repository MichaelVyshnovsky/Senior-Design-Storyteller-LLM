'''Fennibal "Thunder" Bale''' was a famed [[half-elven]] hero celebrated in the nation of [[Aglarond]] well into the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Fennibal was a one-man wrecking crew, and he used his strength in the [[Battle of Ingdal's Arm]] of the {{YearlinkName|1065}}. In the battle against [[human]] infantry, Fennibal charged into his enemies and singlehandedly pushed the entire regimen back. The half-elf gave his life, contributing to the eventual win of his side's troops, leading to the half-elven declaration of independence. Stories of Fennibal "Thunder" Bale's heroics continued to inspire Aglarondans as late as the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. The set of armor worn by him during the fateful battle, the ''[[Mail of Fennibal "Thunder" Bale]]'', eventually left the [[Unapproachable East]] and found itself in the great merchant hands in the city of [[Westgate]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
