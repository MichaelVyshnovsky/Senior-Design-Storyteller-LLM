'''Munaa yr Shunnari el Tarshaj''' was the fifth daughter of [[Syl-pasha|Syl-Pasha]] [[Kadar el Tarshaj]] of [[Calimport]]. She became the second wife of [[Akkabar Shoon the Elder]] on [[Midsummer]] of {{Yearlink|-78}}. As a wedding gift, her father made Akkabar the Elder the [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|Syl]]-[[Alzhedo dictionary#V|Vizar]] and ruler of [[Memnon]].

Seven months after his marriage, Akkabar secretly had nearly all the members of Munaa's family murdered and took the throne of [[Calimshan]] from his father-in-law.
