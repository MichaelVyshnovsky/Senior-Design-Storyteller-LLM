'''Diogi the Wanderer''' was a [[human]] [[wu jen]] from [[T'u Lung]], [[Kara-Tur]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Having left his homeland in disgust at its constant strife, Diogi walked the world of [[Toril]] while looking for a place of peace. While he would get involved in adventures, he would only choose good causes that spread peace.

He had a taboo against attacking first in a fight, with either his stick or his magic.

==Possessions==
He fought with a [[bo stick]] and wore a ''[[robe of protection]] +2''.
