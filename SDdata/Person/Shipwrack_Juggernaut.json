It swam up the river then went into a gate that took it out of Undermountains Sargauth Level.\nBy highsun, the Shipwrack Juggernaut had appeared in the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords, then attacked the port of Skaug and terrorized the pirates there. It focused its attention on the Sea Reavers, a pirate crew returning from looting Amnian ships that were returning to Murann after a successful trade mission to Zakhara. It sank two of their three ships.\nBy dusk, the Shipwrack Juggernaut had collapsed into wreckage. This was later scavenged by the inhabitants of the port for building materials and for whatever treasure could be found in it."
