        "mainbody": "'''Murmur''' was a [[demon]] who was leader of the [[Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye]].  He was able to turn nightmares into flesh and blood and was also capable of possessing people when they slept.  He possessed one of the officers of the [[Firestorm Cabal]] and used her to recruit members of the cabal into the [[Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye]].  Murmur was destroyed in [[1479 DR]] in a fight with the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Demascus]] and his friends.  Demascus believed Murmur was from a reality outside [[Toril]]'s universe. This proved to be correct, as Murmur was in fact a fragment of the [[Voidharrow]], a dead universe that served as the prison of [[Tharizdun]].",
        "Appearance": "In his true form Murmur had black limbs and strange liquid crystal blood.",
