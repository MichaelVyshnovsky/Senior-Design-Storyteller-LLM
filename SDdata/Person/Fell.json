        "mainbody": "'''Fell''' was a fallen [[dabus]] running a [[tattoo]] shop in [[Sigil]], located behind the [[Smoldering Corpse Bar]].",
        "Activities": "There, he made tattoos by using his power of creating images and then inscribing them with special magic directly onto the skin. He could even reproduce some magic tattoos, for the cost of 60 [[gp]] for a common, 600 gp for an uncommon and 6000 gp for a rare. Another profession of his was his knowledge of magic ''[[portal]]s'', which he sold to the highest bidder.",
        "History": "Fell was once a loyal servant to the [[Lady of Pain]], until he fell from grace after pledging his faith to the god [[Aoskar]]. For his actions, he was no longer in the service of the Lady of Pain and lost his ability to hover above the ground."
