        "mainbody": "echelseiya Sammartael was a merchants wife in Suzail, Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nShe was heavily scented.\nThe woman woke some shopkeepers up in the middle of the night just to sample scents, buying the darnedest things.\nHer husband was a rich man.\nShe had a habit of buying things from the alchemist at late hours in the afternoon, and was known for her gossip being bad for business.\nOn the eve of the Council of the Dragon, Nechelseiya Sammartael spent a late evening in Immaero Sraunters apothecary, sampled sixteen vials of perfume and bought only an old ointment. The man had to get out of bed to attend to her purchase. Sraunters guest, the evil vampire archmage Manshoon, took note of that.\nManshoon made it a running joke of reminding Sraunter of Nechelseiya Sammartael. Sraunter eventually got so overworked by Manshoon, he became concerned that she might get in his back rooms if he didnt keep watch."
