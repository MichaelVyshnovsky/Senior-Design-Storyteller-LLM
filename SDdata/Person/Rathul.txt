'''Rathul''' was a sailor, and later a guardsman, who served in the [[Cormyr]]ian [[Blue Dragons|navy]] and later the [[Marsember Watch]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Rathul was one of the oldest members of the Watch, with a beard that had gone gray.

==Relationships==
In the Watch, he served under Topsword [[Kleef Kenric]]. Kleef had never much respect for him during their days on the Watch together, only changing when he volunteered onto the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]'' to seek out the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]''.<ref>

==History==
Rathul joined the navy some time during the midâˆ’15{{th}} century DR, serving for over 30 years. After being aboard a ship that sank for the third time in his life, he chose to try a life on dry land.

He was present in Marsember on [[Uktar 2]] [[1486 DR]], when the city was being evacuated due to the [[Shadovar]] invasion of Cormyr.

When Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]] was abducted that day by the [[Netheril|Netherse]] [[shade]] [[Yder Tanthul]], Rathul volunteered to join the rescue party aboard the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]''.

He was assassinated during his steering shift on the ''Lonely Roamer'', at the hands of [[Yder Tanthul]].<ref>
