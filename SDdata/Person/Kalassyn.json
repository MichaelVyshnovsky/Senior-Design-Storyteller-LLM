        "mainbody": "Kalassyn was a minor Zhentarim wizard in High Dale.\nKalassyn and his fellow Mrinden had fought in Daggerdale.\nIn 1358 DR, Kalassyn was a member of the secret Zhent occupation army in High Dale. Together with his fellow Mrinden and a group of Zhentilar soldiers, he found a gate and a dead guard. They entered the gate but suddenly a meteor—a symptom of the Time of Troubles—hit their squad, killing most of them, including Mrinden. Still burning, Kalassyn managed to re-enter the gate and go back to High Dale. Kalassyn thought he would die but instead he alone survived and two nearby guards helped him to go to the castle to heal."
