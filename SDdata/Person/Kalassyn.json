        "History": "Kalassyn and his fellow [[Mrinden]] had fought in [[Daggerdale]].\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], Kalassyn was a member of the secret [[Zhent]] occupation army in High Dale. Together with his fellow Mrinden and a group of [[Zhentilar]] soldiers, he found a ''[[gate]]'' and a dead guard. They entered the gate but suddenly a [[meteor]]—a symptom of the [[Time of Troubles]]—hit their squad, killing most of them, including Mrinden. Still burning, Kalassyn managed to re-enter the ''gate'' and go back to High Dale. Kalassyn thought he would die but instead he alone survived and two nearby guards helped him to go to the castle to heal."
