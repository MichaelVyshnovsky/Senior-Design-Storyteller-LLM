'''Roekandal''' of [[Reth]] was a mage of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was seen as ruthless, cold, and a master of intrigues.

==History==
Roekandal had long since left the city where his tower stood, to build his power by seizing the magic of mages he thought he could best and slay. He sought the [[Crown of the Undying Flame]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].There is no indication that the city of his tower was actually [[Reth]], but it appears likely.
