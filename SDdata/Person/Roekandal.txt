Roekandal of Reth was a mage of the late 14 century DR.
He was seen as ruthless, cold, and a master of intrigues.
Roekandal had long since left the city where his tower stood, to build his power by seizing the magic of mages he thought he could best and slay. He sought the Crown of the Undying Flame in the early 1370s DR.There is no indication that the city of his tower was actually Reth, but it appears likely.
