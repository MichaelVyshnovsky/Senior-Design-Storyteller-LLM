Oelaerone was a pleasure queen in Zhentil Keep as of the midâ€“14 century DR, and also a Harper.
She knew all the dirty jokes in the business.
She was never far from Belarla, and she knew Mirt. She also knew the way to Myrintaras home.
Oelaerones work as a Harper and a pleasure queen of Zhentil Keep continued until the , when Mirt called upon them to aid Shandril Shessair after her first assault on the Citadel of the Raven. They followed her afterwards when she set out to attack the Wizards Tower.
Myrintara later transported them to the Lonesome Tankard in Eveningstar. There, she argued in favor of Shandril striking again at the Zhents, rather that fleeing to Silverymoon. During the tussle with the forces of Fzoul Chembryl at the Wizards Tower, Oelaerone was struck by a poisoned arrow, taking her out of the fight. She survived the fight, however, and was healed by a kiss from Shandril and her spellfire, getting well enough to leave on her own power soon after.
