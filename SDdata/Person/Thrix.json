        "mainbody": "'''Thrix the Profane''' was a [[cornugon]] that served under [[Belhifet]] in [[Avernus]] for at least a century's time.",
        "Personality": "While he obeyed Belhifet to the letter, Thrix was insightful enough to see when his master's time was at an end. He was also opportunistic enough to aid anyone that appeared to be a threat to Belhifet's reign.",
        "Relationships": "The devil had grown somewhat weary of his master Belhifet, particularly after his failed attempt to conquer [[Easthaven]] and the other [[Ten Towns]] using the [[Crenshinibon]].",
        "History": "Thrix served Belhifet from his escape onto [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1281}} to well into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, he encountered the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]] after the [[imp]] masquerading as [[Hephernaan]] opened the ''[[portal]]'' beneath [[Dragonspear Castle]]. He proposed a wager to the [[Bhaalspawn]]: if the hero could answer a unique riddle, he would grant them a powerful [[magic]]al item and passage into the [[Basalt Tower]], if they couldn't, Thrix would claim their soul or that of one of their companions."
