Emblemat was a Netherese priest who served as the Chief Constable at Constabulary Branch Three in Eileanar before its destruction in .
Emblemat led the constables of the branch and liaised with Karsus and his assistants. He was aided by the Underchiefs Morian, Cadogen, and Goddard, who managed the other constables directly. Emblemat earned a good deal of loyalty from his team, and despite the hard conditions of the job everyone did their best. To help encourage and inspire everyone, Emblemat took up a few unique practices not used elsewhere, such as allowing the constables to keep all the reward money for each criminal caught.
