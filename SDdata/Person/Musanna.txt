Musanna was an aquatic elf warrior-priestess in the Moonsea in 1491 DR.
In 1491 DR, Musanna led a patrol of her fellows in order to rescue her prince, Ulatha Mesavir, who had been kidnapped by the Cult of the Crushing Wave. Musanna and her fellows inspected the ruined Fort Dalton, where they defeated some cultists and met an adventuring party hired to destroy a bandit group active near River Lisâ€”in truth, the same cultists. Musanna likely joined the adventurers in their mission.
