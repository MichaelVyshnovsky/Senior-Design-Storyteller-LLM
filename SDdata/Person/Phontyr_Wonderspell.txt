It was said that Phontyr knew a sorceress who was an ally, lifelong friend, and possibly even a lover of his. However, she became polymorphed and stuck in the form of a unicorn forever and Phontyr was unable to free her from magic more powerful than this own. This was but one story given for the mysterious apparition of a unicorn at the place where his house once stood.
