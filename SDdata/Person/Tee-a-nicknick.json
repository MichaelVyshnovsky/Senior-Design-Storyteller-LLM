        "mainbody": "'''Tee-a-nicknkick''' was a half-[[qullan]] pirate who plotted the assassination of [[Captain Deudermont]] with his companion, [[Creeps Sharky]], in the late 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The half-qullan man had thick black hair tied in a topknot, and tattoos covering practically every part of his body, including his face. He wore a tiger-skin kilt, which exposed a lot of his skin. He struggled with speaking [[Common]], and would often replace words with others.",
        "History": "Tee-a-nicknick was born to a qullan tribe on an unknown island. Being only half-qullan, his ferocious tribe of full-blood qullans rejected him as inferior. Tee-a-nicknick remained on the island until he was taken by a group of pirates. After this, the half-qullan sailed with humans for most of his life.\n\nHe became friends with a fellow pirate known as Creeps Sharky, who realized Tee-a-nicknick's skill with the deadly [[blowpipe|blowgun]]. The exotic warrior concocted the blowgun dart with a [[cat]]'s claw, feathers, and an oozing syrup. Among the shadows of a rooftop, the pirates waited for Deudermont to exit the [[Cutlass (inn)|Cutlass]] inn in [[Luskan]] and meet with [[Wulfgar]] and [[Morik]]. After Tee-a-nicknick blew his dart into the pirate captain, they then moved down the street and pretended to be drunks to avoid the authorities.\n\nTee-a-nicknick was later caught, brutally tortured, and killed at Luskan's [[Prisoners' Carnival]]."
