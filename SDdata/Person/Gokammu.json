        "mainbody": "'''Gokammu''' was the retired emperor of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Gokammu was emperor until [[1352 DR]] when he retired in favor of his son, [[Gonijo]]. He became head of the [[Office of the Retired Emperor]] but unlike previously retired emperors, Gokammu continued plotting to gain more power, also courting those families slighted by the [[Takenaka clan]]. On the surface, he acted as a neutral figure among the different factions.",
        "Personality": "Gokammu dreamed of regaining the power of the emperors of the past, but to achieve this he needed to defeat not only the [[shogun]] and the [[shikken]], but also any other clan that would try to achieve these positions in the future. Despite the immense difficulty, he contained to work toward his goal, with the support of some noble families."
