        "mainbody": "'''Charming Latham''' was an [[evoker]] [[wizard]] member of [[The Guild]] crime gang of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Charming was a [[human]] man with a pale skin tone, brown eyes, and facial [[tattoo]]s. He hid his hairless face behind a hooded [[sorcerer]]'s [[robe]] dyed [[emerald]] green, the Guild's telltale color. He was armed with a simple [[dagger]].",
        "Abilities": "Charming specialized in magic of the [[evocation]] [[school of magic]]. He would use such [[spell]]s as ''[[conjure water elemental]]'', ''[[ice knife]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', and ''[[ray of frost]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Charming Latham worked under [[Farlin]], who led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]]. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and his squad's fate remained uncertain, whether they were killed by the gangsters or survived and returned safely to the Guild's safehouse."
