{{quote|''It's the master's ascension. Once the ritual is complete, he is to be reborn, even more perfect and powerful than before. You should be there - all his children were to attend. He'll be furious you're not.''|Vilhelm}}

==Description==
Vilhelm was a [[human]] man with a pale light skin tone, blue eyes, and long light brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Vilhelm was but one of many enthralled servants and guards who staffed the massive Szarr Palaceâ€”the home of [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]] located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. When Cazador's ascension ritual began and kickstarted a massacre of the party guests behind a magically sealed door, Vilhelm was tasked with standing by the entrance, allowing invited guests in to their doom. Vilhelm knew of the ritual's purpose and expected all Cazador's "children" to be in the [[Tourmaline Depths]] as the part of the ritual. Vilhelm both feared and was loyal to his master.
