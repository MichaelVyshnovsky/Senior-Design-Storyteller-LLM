        "mainbody": "Umi was a regular patron of the Beached Leviathan, one of the most popular taverns of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15 century DR.\nUmi was known as the \"helmswoman\" of the Beached Leviathan because she was like the unpaid enforcer of the tavern. When things went out of control, Umi helped to calm down fights and kick off problematic patrons. She was rewarded with free drinks for the evening every time she had quelled a fight. She also cared for Harrag, the Beached Leviathans owner, trying to protect him from Dagult Neverembers plots whenever possible.\nUmi was also involved in less savory endeavors. She served as a contact person for many kinds of illegal business in Neverwinter."
