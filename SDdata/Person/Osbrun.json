        "mainbody": "King '''Osbrun''' was the king of the city of [[Chessagol]] (later called [[Tsurlagol]]) in [[the Vast]] in the early 1350s [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">''[[The Magister (sourcebook)|The Magister]]'' gives a rather late date (1351 DR) for the presence of kings in \"Chessagol\", which seems at odds with [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' 2nd edition (revised): ''A Grand Tour of the Realms'']], which describes government by a council in Tsurlagol in [[1367 DR]]. With 10-year terms, this seems well established yet overlapping the reign of kings. However, there are multiple possible explanations, such as a surviving royal line with no power; an exiled king of another kingdom; or monarchic rule interrupting the oligarchic rule of the Council. This last is particularly fitting with the city's many conquests.",
        "History": "King Osbrun once bought the shield called ''[[Thurbrand's protector]]'' from the warrior [[Thurbrand]].\n\nIn the [[1351 DR|Year of the Crown, 1351 DR]], the king's treasury and armory were robbedâ€”by magic, some said. This included ''Thurbrand's protector''."
