        "mainbody": "Barrowin Undurr was a devoted dwarf cleric of Gorm Gulthyn. Along with several other adventurers, she played a vital role in thwarting the schemes of the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 century DR.\nShe had a dour outlook on life but would always stand against evil, especially when it moved against dwarvenkind.\nBarrowin took immaculate care of her weapons and armor. She never let them become rusty.\nShe kept a single gem along with her during her travels, and had regular conversations with it. It was unknown whether or not the gem ever reciprocated.\nBarrowin was born in the area of the Great Rift, and she managed her familys business holdings in Ironmaster near Icewind Dale. She spent fifteen years there on assignment in Ironstar. Her life was not exciting enough for her, so she asked her family for relocation. When that request went unheard, she called on her deity to provide a new path.\nGorm answered indirectly. Barrowin found a new life, by falling in love with Storn Skulldark, a wealthy young Ironstar dwarf. Barrowin and Storn set out from Ironstar to build a fortress along the route from Neverwinter to Icewind Dale, within the Spine of the World mountain range.\nThe project had many setbacks, chief of which was the sudden disappearance of Storn Skulldarks fortune in Ironmaster. Storn traveled back without Barrowin to find his missing gold. During his journey he was attacked and carried off by a white dragon. His fate was unknown. Barrowin was devastated by this loss. She left Ironmaster, and joined the Order of the Gauntlet.\nthumb|right|300px|Barrowin and her allies battling the Cult of the Dragon in Icewind Dale.\nSome time in the 1480s DR, Barrowin served as the Order of the Gauntlets representative on a mission to stop the Cult of the Dragon from retrieving the Red Dragon Mask. Along with her new companions, Alaeros Margaster and Nymmestra Durothil, Barrowin traveled from Neverwinter back to Icewind Dale to stop the Cult. There the trio picked up two more allies, Ratshadow and Talon Everhale, and found out the cult had uncovered a stone-arch portal that granted them passageway to the isle of Tuern. Eventually, Barrowin and her four allies acquired full knowledge about the Cult of the Dragons ultimate plan.\nWhile on Tuern, Barrowin and her allies ventured into the Flame Fault and slew Lostmauth, one of the isles three red dragon overlords. Their efforts were in vain however, as the cults leader Severin Silrajin acquired the Red Dragon Mask and fled back to Neverwinter. \nWhile they were stranded for a short while, and stashed it at Ulbrinter Villa in Waterdeep for his Zhentarim masters. Barrowin and her three remaining allies followed the trail of the cult to Waterdeep, but arrived at the Waterdhavian manor too late to save its noble lord. They did however find Varramzord, one of the cults wyrmspeakers, and learned that Severin had completed the Mask of the Dragon Queen and was ready to summon Tiamat from the Nine Hells.\nBarrowin and her fellow adventurers joined the allied forces of the Sword Coast in a great battle against the Cult of the Dragon at the Well of Dragons. While Tiamat briefly appeared on Faer√ªn from the depths of the Nine Hells, she was quickly defeated."
