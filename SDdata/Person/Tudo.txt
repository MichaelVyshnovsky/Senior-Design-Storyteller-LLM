Tudo was an honest human rogue who ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor in search of glory and treasures in 1369 DR.
Tudo was young and quite handsome.
Tudo considered himself to be an honorable rogue. He was prone to being a daredevil, and always performed stunts and dares, and he loved taking wagers to make a quick coin.
Tudo was a competent rogue who mastered short swords and bows. He possessed sharp combat reflexes and was proficient in using bows in close combat. He was also very dexterous and a strong athlete.
When Tudo was rescued from the prisons under Castle Cormanthor, he was wearing his enchanted +4 leather armor, magical gauntlets of dexterity, and a +3 necklace of protection. He was armed with his trusty black short sword Backstabber and had a potion of healing.
Tudo hailed from Hillsfar where he one day in 1369 DR decided to take a bet for a years worth of wages to sneak into Myth Drannor and bring back a piece of Castle Cormanthor. Tudo made it safely past the monsters and cultists and reached the Castle, but was detected and imprisoned by the Cult of the Dragon who used Castle Cormanthor as their base at the time.
He was taken deep into the Elven Catacombs under the castle to the Cults makeshift prison. There, a fellow thief and an entrepreneur named Nottle encountered Tudo during one of his expeditions into the ruins to scavenge for loot to sell. Nottle broke Tudo out of the cell and shortly after, a group of adventurers from Phlan, the Veiled Ones, encountered the two arguing about a treasure. Tudo asked to join the group in search of glory, adventure, and treasure. Together, they set out to stop the Cults operations in Myth Drannor and the corruption of the citys mythal.
