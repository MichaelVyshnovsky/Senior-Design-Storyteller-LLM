        "Personality": "Tim was mocked by his fellows by his cowardice and lack of ability.",
        "Powers": "The elf was a mage, still getting used to casting spells. The only spell he had learned was ''[[magic missile]]''.",
        "History": "From his own accounts, his parents were slain when he was a babe, and he was raised by [[wolf|wolves]] for two decades. Eventually, a beautiful [[ranger]] became entranced by his mysterious wildness and took him from the forest. Some time later, he met his fellow adventurers, [[Bondari]] and [[Nanoc]] in a [[tavern]]. The group foolishly decided to enter a cavern to [[the Underdark]], and they encountered the mad [[wizard]] [[Iycanth]]'s creations. The creatures quickly petrified the trio, turning them to stone."
