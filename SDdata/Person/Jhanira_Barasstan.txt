Jhanira Barasstan was a young priestess of Chauntea inhabiting the town of Ashabenford in Mistledale during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Jhanira mainted the small Shrine to Chauntea located near the center of town. One day she hoped to see the shrine develop into a full-fledged temple to her goddess.
