Gallissoniere was a Netherese thief who plied his trade in Eileanar shortly before its destruction in .
While in the enclave, Gallissoniere discovered the criminal history of Cadogen, an Underchief of Constabulary Branch Three who had lived a long life in the shadows. He proceeded to blackmail Cadogen for three months, demanding information on the constabularys operations and movements, until finally Cadogen had enough. He killed Gallissoniere, and then claimed that the rogue had drawn a knife and attempted to fight his way to freedom during a routine arrest.
