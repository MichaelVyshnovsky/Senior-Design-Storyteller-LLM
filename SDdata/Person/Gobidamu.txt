'''Gobidamu''' was a monk and the retired emperor of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Gobidamu was emperor from [[1326 DR]] until [[1333 DR]] when he retired in favor of his son, [[Gokammu]]. Afterward, he became a monk of the [[Kanchai]] school at the monastery of [[Mount Ichi]] under the name '''Shoku'''.

==Personality==
Gobidamu liked his current life meditating and writing poetry, and he would never leave the temple. Despite this, he was greatly involved in the temple's politics, granting the temple's support to [[Takenaka Sugawara]], as asked by his son Gokammu.
