Lamona was a Sharran Fidelian – a mage in the hidden Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Lamona was a wood elven woman with a pale skin complexion, watery grey eyes, tattooed neck, and white hair streaked with pink. She wore Sharran Fidelian robes and hid her face behind a white porcelain mask adorned with Shars holy symbol.
Like her fellow Sharran Fidelians, Lamona wielded a quarterstaff in battle and was proficient with dark magics that created clouds of darkness. She herself was not hindered by such clouds as Sharran Fidelians were born into darkness – they could freely see in magical darkness and could never be blinded.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Lamona served the Mother Superior Viconia DeVir in the underground Cloister of Sombre Embrace as one of her cultists underneath the House of Grief. Lamona, along with the entirety of the cloister may have confronted its rogue member named Shadowheart, were she to turn away from Shar. Lamona could have perished in the struggle. By other accounts, Fidelian and the rest of the cloister helped defend the city of Baldurs Gate from the army of the Absolute, were Shadowheart to remain loyal to her evil deity, or if Shadowheart was betrayed and surrendered to the Mother Superior for punishment.
