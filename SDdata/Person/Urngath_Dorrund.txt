'''Urngath Dorrund''' was an [[alchemist]] from [[Chavyondat]], [[Estagund]], living in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. He called his home town by its original name, Klionna.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|55}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 46: Doings in Delzimmer, Part 5}}

Around this time, Dorrund hired [[Rollivar's Redfangs]], a mercenary company based in Delzimmer, to round up at least forty adult [[goblin]]s from a certain area in the nearby [[Toadsquat Mountains]] and bring them back alive. He required they be from the area roughly bounded by the peaks known as Klauntra's Leap, the Wyrmlar, and Liontlefang. The Redfangs did as he stipulated and captured about sixty creatures in the hopes of getting the required forty back alive, but not before slaughtering hundreds (local rumors made it a thousand) of goblins that swarmed out of the mountains when the alarm went up. After beating back the local goblins, they hastily retreated with their captives, eventually having to fight off goblin raiding parties from the eastern Toadsquats, losing a few of their company and their cargo before reaching safety in the vicinity of Delzimmer.

Dorrund was not forthcoming with a reason for wanting forty captured goblins but whispers around town speculated that he believed their blood had magical properties because the creatures drank from mountain springs that bubbled up through a subterranean magic zone. No one knew the source of this reservoir of magic, but the rumors offered the possibility it was a lost [[dwarf|dwarven]] or [[elf|elven]] cache, a buried [[Netherese]] city, or something even more ancient.
