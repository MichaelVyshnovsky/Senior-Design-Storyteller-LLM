        "mainbody": "'''Sardrin Olaundran''' was a member of the [[Olaundran]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "Sardrin was an over-indulgent young man but quite active and robust. As a general rule, he wore fine clothing made from a true gold-colored (never yellow) cloth called [[shimmerweave]], but also wore the latest fashions when they suited him.",
        "Personality": "Sardrin and his brother [[Elvolaer Olaundran|Elvolaer]] were very much alike, which occasionally led to competition and even heated disagreements, but more often they were a team, either causing trouble, getting into trouble, or both. Like the whole Olaundran clan, they never bargained over the price of goods and services, always paying full price. As a point of pride, they only paid attention to money when gambling.",
        "Activities": "{{Main|Olaundran}}\nSardrin's hobbies included hawking and hunting, gambling, and wagering on fights between beasts or slaves (usually mudwrestling).",
        "Relationships": "Sardrin was the third child and second eldest son of [[Yolaun Olaundran]], one of the ''de facto'' leaders of the family business. He was the grandson of the patriarch of the clan, \"Old\" [[Gauthklaun Olaundran|Gauthklaun]]. After him, there were three younger siblings."
