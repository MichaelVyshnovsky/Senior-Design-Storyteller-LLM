{{quote|Dad, breathe - I'm all right. And you - thank you for stopping those... whatever they were.|Nafula}}

==Description==
Nafula, just like her father, [[Madalitso]], had a dark bronze skin color and dark brown eyes. She kept her blonde curly hair gathered in a bushy top bun.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the time [[Captain Grisly]] was replaced by the [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Madalitso and Nafula could often be found in the tavern's second floor taproom. At that time, Madalitso was trying to convince Nafula to marry someone for the family's financial well-being, yet Nafula was opposed to an arranged marriage without love. However, she was open to at least meeting the suitor before turning him down completely for the family's sake with some convincing.
