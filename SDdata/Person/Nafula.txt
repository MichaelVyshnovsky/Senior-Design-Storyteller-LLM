Nafula was a human patron of the Blushing Mermaid in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Nafula, just like her father, Madalitso, had a dark bronze skin color and dark brown eyes. She kept her blonde curly hair gathered in a bushy top bun.
In the , during the time Captain Grisly was replaced by the green hag Auntie Ethel as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Madalitso and Nafula could often be found in the taverns second floor taproom. At that time, Madalitso was trying to convince Nafula to marry someone for the familys financial well-being, yet Nafula was opposed to an arranged marriage without love. However, she was open to at least meeting the suitor before turning him down completely for the familys sake with some convincing.
