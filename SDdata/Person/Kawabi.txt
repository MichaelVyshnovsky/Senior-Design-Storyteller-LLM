'''Kawabi''' was the governor of the province of [[Chu' Yuan]] in [[Shou Lung]] ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2608|SY}}.

==Relationship==
Kawabi was the sixth cousin of the Emperor.

==History==
Kawabi was for many years the governor of Chu' Yuan and under his rule and focus on public works the Bamboo Plains became more civilized in Shou eyes.

Kawabi, however, was an evil man and he searched for a means to achieve more power. At last, in 2608 SY, he found in uncharted lands near Chu' Yuan the damned citadel of [[Tempat Larang]], There, Kawabi found an army of [[Stone Knights of Shih|stone spirit]]s ready to command.

To avoid suspicion in the meantime, he spread chaos in his province, sending raiders to attack villagers and caravans. However, the Emperor decided to send General [[Goyat Nagumo]] to help him pacify the area. Soon, Goyat discovered the treason of Kawabi.

The armies of Kawabi and of Goyat Nagumo clashed near the city of [[Hui]] and the general defeated the governor. Kawabi, however, escaped and Goyat followed him, resolute in making him pay for his treason.

At last, Goyat confronted and defeated Kawabi at Tempat Larang. Goyat executed Kawabi but was corrupted by the dark spirit of the citadel and sought to create a new empire with himself as its head.
