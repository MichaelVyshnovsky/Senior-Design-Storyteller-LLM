'''Joreld Nerunnanthur''' was a [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was particularly indifferent to noble lords' deaths, and disliked [[Glathra Barcantle]]'s leadership.

==Relationships==
He disliked [[Surgol Velard]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Joreld was among the many War Wizards that responded in the wake of the disaster during the [[Council of the Dragon]]. He commented about the deaths of many nobles during the event while heading towards Glathra Barcantle to make their report, together with [[Welwyn Tracegar]]. They were so engrossed in their converse that they missed [[Amarune Whitewave]] running loose in the castle, and almost missed [[Mirt]] doing the same thing; they dismissed him instead as probably unimportant.

Later, he was called upon by Glathra to capture Amarune and [[Storm Silverhand]], who wanted to talk to King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] about the [[blueflame ghost]]s sighted during the Council. Her order was cut short, and she neglected to call it again.

==Rumors & Legends==
He considered the deaths of [[Montror Barelder]] and [[Lyrannus Tantorn]] to be nothing worth fighting over.
