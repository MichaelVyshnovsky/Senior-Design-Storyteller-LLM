The annoyances of ink stains that covered his hands, the acrid smell of paint and inevitable wrist cramps made his chosen profession insufferable.\nHe worked as an illuminator for over 15 years, adding artistic depictions to what were otherwise dry and boring texts. He much preferred working on penitentials, religious works that depicted scenes of the afterlife to those that were penitent. They gave him opportunity to paint vivid depictions of how he imagined the denizens of the City of Strife in Hades.\nBevis was the father of Rinda, an especially skilled scribe of Zhentil Keep.\nSome time during or before the , Bevis was hired by the church of Cyric to illustrate a tome that depicted scenes from the Time of Troubles, the year when the gods of Faer√ªn walked as mortals on Toril.\nThe book Bevis received was one of the early drafts of the Cyrinishad. Bevis read the entire book,\nAfter his death, Bevis soul languished as one of the Burning Men that hung from within Cyrics palace in the City of Strife."
