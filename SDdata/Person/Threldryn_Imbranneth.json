Beldred Truesilver sent Threldryn and Brace Skatterhawk to watch Alusair when she stepped aside to receive a private message. They returned to find Beldred and the knights had impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs, before deducing they served a dark naga and the Zhentarim, who had been charming and transporting monsters into the area Threldryn struggled to catch up to her reasoning. He was one of those who volunteered to aid Alusair, and had a hand in slaying the naga."
