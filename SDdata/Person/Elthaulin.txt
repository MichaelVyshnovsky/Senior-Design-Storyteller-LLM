Elthaulin was a Zhentarim priest of Bane during the mid-14 century DR.
Elthaulin was ambitious, fanatic, self-important, and manipulative.
One of his spells allowed his voice to reverberate loudly.
As an upperpriest, Elthaulin carried out a number of rites for the Temple of Bane.
He had a rivalry with Fzoul Chembryl, whom he absolutely hated, seeking to kill and replace him.
Elthaulin was leading a rite at the Dark Shrine in Zhentil Keep before Shandrils arrival, which was cut short by Fzoul Chembryl Elthaulin resented this immensely. He didnt notice, but his rite resulted in a genuine sign from Bane.
While Shandril was on her way to fighting Fzoul Chembryl, Elthaulin began to gather the priests loyal to him through Neaveil and Oprion Blackstone, commanding they find all priests more loyal to him than to Fzoul.
