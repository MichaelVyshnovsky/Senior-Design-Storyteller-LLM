        "mainbody": "exon was a Vaasan warrior that joined several of his countrymen on an expedition to the city of Evereska in the late 14 century DR. There they reunited with Melegaunt Tanthul, an ally of their ancestors who led them to a series of events that would reshape the face of Faerûn for decades to follow.\nHe was a swarthy and burly man, His appearance (and disposition) was akin to that of a good-natured bear.\nDuring one of his battles while fighting along the elves of Evereska, Dexons leg was badly injured, withered to the point where it could hardly bear his weight.\nDexon was both a steadfast warrior as well as a kind and caring man. While he and his men were always ready for battle, Dexon often found himself a bit flummoxed when confronted with matters of love.\nLike his fellow Vaasans that made the expedition to the Sharn Wall beneath Evereska, Dexon was the proud owner of a darksword. His blade had the unique quirk of \"talking in its sleep\", presumably when sheathed.\nThe burly Vaasan warrior developed a loving and passionate romance with one of his partys elven hosts, Keya Nihmedu. After a few short months together they fell in love, and Dexon became very protective of Keya, even if he had trouble expressing himself.\nDexon joined the expedition from Vaasa to Evereska in the Western Heartlands in the . After traveling to Evereska in the Greycloak Hills, Dexon chose to to remain within the elven city. During his travels he developed feelings for Keya Nihmedu of the Vale Guard. \nIn mid–Mirtul of that year, the archmage Khelben Arunsun finally broke through the phaerimm-led siege of Evereska and began coordinating the citys defense with the Hill Elders. Dexon and his men served as the Blackstaffs personal escorts for a time. When the time came that Khelbens company leave to fight the phaerimm, Dexon was saddened to part ways from Keya.\nThe pair reunited in battle when the phaerimm attacked the Vine Vale on Mirtul 20. During the fighting, Keya made use of Dexons darksword and felt no ill effects—a sensation of cold that left the blade unwieldable after a short time—and realized they had been bonded as family. Keya was expectant with Dexons child. As Dexon suffered a grievous wound shortly thereafter,"
