        "mainbody": "'''Markham Southwell''' was the sheriff of [[Bryn Shander]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Appointed as sheriff by Town Speaker [[Duvessa Shane]], Markham's duties involved keeping the peace in Bryn Shander and training the militia. He spent little time at his converted office in the Town Hall, however.",
        "Relations": "His sister, [[Semile Southwell]], lived in the settlement of [[Nightstone]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. When she was slain in a [[giant]] attack, her neighbor, [[Morak Ur'gray]], may have sent adventurers to inform Markham.",
        "History": "Some time after [[1485 DR]], Markham escorted Duvessa to the town gate when [[Drufi]] and her [[frost giant]]s and [[winter wolves]] came demanding they hand over [[Artus Cimber]] and the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'', despite the townsfolk having no idea who or what they wanted. Markham was heavily involved in the subsequent defense of the town. In the aftermath, Markham may have deputized some adventurers to patrol the surrounding lands in case of further giant activity.",
        "Personality": "Although likeable, Markham was taciturn and disinterested in small talk. He never showed his emotions while as he focused on his job of protecting Bryn Shander and Icewind Dale as a whole, as well as aiding Town Speaker Duvessa. He judged people by what they did, not what they said, and believed everyone should be treated with dignity.",
        "Description": "He was brawny of build.",
        "Possessions": "He fought with [[longsword]] and [[heavy crossbow]]."
