'''Vicar Humbletoes''' was a [[cleric]] guardian of the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]], a non-denominational shrine located on the [[Stormshore Street]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} cenutury [[DR]].

{{quote|I am Vicar Humbletoes, guardian of the Stormshore Tabernacle. I keep the peace in this sacred place and guide those in need. My purpose is to connect every soul with its divine patron. How could I do that if I couldn't distinguish what deities they serve?|Vicar Humbletoes}}

==Description==
Vicar Humbletoes was an unimpressive-looking middle-aged [[rock gnome]]. The man had a light skin tone, hazel eyes, and a light brown, severely balding head of hair.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when the [[Absolute crisis]] quite literally shook the city, Vicar Humbletoes was the priest who ran the Stormshore Tabernacle, its shrines to multiple gods, donations to the deities represented, the shrine's library of religious texts and a vault underneath where the shrine kept the most precious tithes. Vicar was able to feel the visitor's chosen deity and whether the visiting paladin was an [[oathbreaker]]. The Stormshore Tabernacle welcomed everyone, even the clerics of the evil deity [[Lolth]] and oathbreaker paladins, despite the vicar being taken aback. In addition to manning the shrine, Humbletoes offered various holy relics, spells, resurrections, and magic items to those willing to part with [[coin]].
