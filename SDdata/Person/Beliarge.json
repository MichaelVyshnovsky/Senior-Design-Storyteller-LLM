        "mainbody": "Beliarge was a Zhentarim mage of the mid-14 century DR.\nAt the time of his death, he wore a dark robe and many rings. He often sported a cruel smile.\nTo Fzoul Chembryl, Beliarge was ambitious and capable enough to be a threat. To foes at a disadvantage, he acted courteous but arrogant.\nHe knew a spell of paralyzation that was powerful enough to hold even Storm Silverhand, and which would not be affected by anything he did, even if he ran her through in plain view.\nIn late , Fzoul Chembryl sent Beliarge to attack Tessarils Tower and capture Shandril Shessair after the destruction of Iliph Thraun, urging him to attack while her spellfire was depleted. He materialized in the location shortly afterwards, striking Tessaril Winter and Storm Silverhand with a paralyzing spell of his own devising, powerful enough to hold the two of them Shandril instead escaped into the Hidden House of Eveningstar. There, she ambushed him with a sword, managing to get a decisive kill before he could react."
