        "mainbody": "Kashada the Nightwraith was a shadow mystic (probably a shadow adept) and an aspect of Shar.\nKashada was tall. She wore a cloak, a veil of cloth and shadow, and tight black assassins garb.\nShe was able to turn herself into shadow and enter the Plane of Shadow.\nIn 1373 DR, Kashada was allied with Zasian Menz, a priest of Cyric in Sundabar. She wanted to raise a Sharran temple in Sundabar to take her revenge on the North. She disguised herself as \"Ansa\" (who was in fact Aliisza in disguise) and replaced her in the Masters Hall in Sundabar. Some time later she was captured by Tauran and Micus, astral deva servants of Tyr, and imprisoned in a sphere of light with no shadows, which drove her insane.\nTwelve years later she was freed by Zasian with the help of Myshik Morueme. She regained her sanity and journeyed with Zasian and Myshik to Dweomerheart, where they were able to cause a distraction and steal Azuths staff. Kashada was revealed to be an aspect of Shar, and plunged a dagger into Zasians back. Cyric subsequently used Azuths staff to slay Mystra."
