        "Description": "Kashada was tall. She wore a cloak, a veil of cloth and shadow, and tight black assassin's garb.",
        "Powers": "She was able to turn herself into shadow and enter the [[Plane of Shadow]].",
        "History": "In [[1373 DR]], Kashada was allied with [[Zasian Menz]], a priest of [[Cyric]] in [[Sundabar]]. She wanted to raise a Sharran temple in Sundabar to take her revenge on the [[North]]. She disguised herself as \"Ansa\" (who was in fact [[Aliisza]] in disguise) and replaced her in the [[Master's Hall]] in [[Sundabar]]. Some time later she was captured by [[Tauran]] and [[Micus]], [[astral deva]] servants of [[Tyr]], and imprisoned in a sphere of light with no shadows, which drove her insane.\n\nTwelve years later she was freed by Zasian with the help of [[Myshik Morueme]]. She regained her sanity and journeyed with Zasian and Myshik to [[Dweomerheart]], where they were able to cause a distraction and steal [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]]. Kashada was revealed to be an aspect of Shar, and plunged a dagger into Zasian's back. Cyric subsequently used Azuth's staff to slay [[Mystra]]."
