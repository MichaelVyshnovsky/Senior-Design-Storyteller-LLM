==History==
Baert Ghalhunt was one of the three bullyblades accompanying Marlin Stormserpent as the latter took to the Windstag family hunting lodge while fleeing [[Suzail]]. Ghalhunt stayed to guard Marlin, and lit the fire in the lodge out of his own initiative, without prompting. He afterwards went out to get more firewood; however, almost instantly he crossed the threshold, he was decapitated, and his head thrown at the fireplace by a [[blueflame ghost]] under the control of the sorceress [[Cymmarra]], the Lady of Ghosts.

His head was completely burnt by the time Marlin's other two bullyblades came back to the house.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|270|28}}
