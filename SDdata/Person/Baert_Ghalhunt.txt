Baert Ghalhunt was one of Marlin Stormserpents henchmen in the late 15 century DR.
He often started tasks out of his own initiative.
He worked for Marlin Stormserpent.
By the end, Marlin considered him one of the few men he could trust at all.
Baert Ghalhunt was one of the three bullyblades accompanying Marlin Stormserpent as the latter took to the Windstag family hunting lodge while fleeing Suzail. Ghalhunt stayed to guard Marlin, and lit the fire in the lodge out of his own initiative, without prompting. He afterwards went out to get more firewood however, almost instantly he crossed the threshold, he was decapitated, and his head thrown at the fireplace by a blueflame ghost under the control of the sorceress Cymmarra, the Lady of Ghosts.
His head was completely burnt by the time Marlins other two bullyblades came back to the house.
