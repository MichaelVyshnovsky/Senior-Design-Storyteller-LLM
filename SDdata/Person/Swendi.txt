Swendi was a human from Maztica who once helped defeat a pteranodon.
Clad in sparse tribal clothing, Swendi had short-cropped black hair and deeply tanned skin.
Swendi was the eldest child of his tribes chieftain. It was very important to him to be regarded as a great warrior, and he would often take great risks to accomplish this.
He owned a dagger, sling, as well as a trident.
Swendi once assisted Joseph, a stowaway who ended up in Maztica, in taking down a pteranodon.
