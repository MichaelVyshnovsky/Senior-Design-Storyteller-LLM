The High Priestess taught that for the worship of Sune to be true, one had to know oneself. Every person had beauty about them as long as they could find it and cherish it.",
        "Relationships": "In her late 40s, Morlain was the target of other beautiful and ambitions Hearrwarders of Sune who aimed to challenge the High Priestess for her position due to Morlain's creeping age. However, as of the late 1370s DR, Morlain's keen fashion sense and masterful use of cosmetics kept potential challengers at bay.\n\nMorlain was loyally devoted to her beloved husband and fellow Hearrwarder of Sune – [[Ilbrar the Iron]]. Despite their relationship, Morlain always expressed admiration for beautiful men and women.",
