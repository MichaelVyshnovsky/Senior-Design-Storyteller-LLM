        "mainbody": "gorn Fuoco () was a high-ranking member of Manshoons Zhentarim in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.\nAgorn lived and played music in Mistshore. Later, he settled in Kolat Tower with his master Manshoon.\nAgorn dreamed of becoming a famous bard but he had no success so he decided to devote himself to the Zhentarim, quickly advancing through the ranks.\nIn 1492 DR, if Manshoon managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, after the Xanathars Thieves Guild and some adventurers discovered the Stones hideout devised by the dragonborn butcher Thrakkus, then the high-ranking Zhent Vevette was instructed to deliver the Stone to Agorn. She would manage to deliver it during a performance at the Trades Ward theater called the Brizzenbright.\nAfterward, Agorn went to meet his mother and, inspired by the theaters play and by Amath, he tried to kill the woman in order to cut all his ties to his old family.\nAgorn was one of the lieutenants of Manshoon who was very impressed by him."
