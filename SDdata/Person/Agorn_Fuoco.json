She would manage to deliver it during a performance at the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep|Trades Ward]] theater called the [[Brizzenbright]].\n\nAfterward, Agorn went to meet his mother and, inspired by the theater's play and by Amath, he tried to kill the woman in order to cut all his ties to his old family.",
