Gori was a Neverwintan soldier stationed in the Leilon garrison in the High Tower of Thalivar in the late 15 century DR.
Gori was a timid dwarven soldier.
When Leilon was resettled in the late 15 century DR, Dagult Neverember sent some of Neverwinters soldiers to defend the settlers during the towns reconstruction. Gori was among these soldiers, serving under Sergeant Hazz Yorrums command. The High Tower of Thalivar acted as a garrison for the soldiers. However, it turned out that the wizard tower was haunted by the ghost of Thalivar. The wizards spirit drove away Gori, Yorrum and two other soldiers (Erlum and Koz). However, the town mage Gallio Elibro refused to leave. The soldiers had recently noticed Gallios odd behavior but they were unaware that Thalivars ghost took possession of the mage every night. A group of adventurers took care of the ghost.
