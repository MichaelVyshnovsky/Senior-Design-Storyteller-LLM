Trenzia was one of Halasters new apprentices in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
At one point before 1492 DR, Trenzia was chosen by Halaster to be one of his new apprentices. At one point, to expand her scientific and necromantic research, she asked Halaster to transform her into a flameskull and Halaster agreed, also granting her a lair inside the Arcane Chambers.
Trenzia was busy with her experiments in necromancy and electricity using copper, and was assisted by a flesh golem.
Trenzia was driven mad by her researches and sacrificed her own body to construct a device that fused necromancy and electricity.
Trenzia had become paranoid about the other apprentices of Halaster, believing that they couldnt understand her genius.
