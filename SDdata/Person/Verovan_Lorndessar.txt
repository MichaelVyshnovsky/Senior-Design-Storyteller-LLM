'''Verovan Lorndessar''' was the last king of the city of [[Westgate]].

==Relationships==
He was the great grandson of King [[Blaervaer Lorndessar]].

==History==
Verovan ruled from the {{YearlinkName|1236}}, until the {{YearlinkName|1248}}.

Verovan perished during a boat race on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]],

==Rumors & Legends==
It was a belief among some that Verovan Lorndessar sold a part of his soul to some unknown demon lord in exchange for a pocket plane somewhere in the [[Abyss]]. The King turned it into his fabled treasure vault, accessible only through a secret mechanism known only to Verovan. The knowledge of the vault might've been lost forever with the King's death.
