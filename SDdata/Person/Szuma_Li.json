        "History": "Szuma Li joined the army of [[Yrkhetep|Khan Kertep]] in [[1354 DR]] because the khan appeared to be chosen by a god and because all his predictions were proved true. However, when in [[1358 DR]], Kertep's army marched upon the city of [[Hlath]] in [[Chondath]], Szuma Li happened to see the khan transforming himself into a horrible [[Arcanaloth|jackal-faced demon]]. Totally shocked, he deserted and escaped. Szuma decided to ally with the defenders of Hlath, telling them all he knew about Kertep's tactics before helping defend the city.",
