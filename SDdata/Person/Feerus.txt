'''King Feerus''' was a [[myconid]] ruler who lived in the myconid caverns deep below [[Icewind Dale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The myconid king was aware of the journey of a party of adventurers to [[Menzoberranzan]] to recover their town council from the [[drow]], and thus welcomed them as friends. He and his subjects were generally unwelcoming to outsiders, unless they were clearly opposed to the drow.

The myconid caverns where the king resided produced a rare antidote to all poisons known to the myconids. However, [[umber hulk]]s would often tear up the herbal patches containing the antidote, much to the king's anger. The companions slew the umber hulks, and thus were given the fungal antidote, and allowed access to pass.
