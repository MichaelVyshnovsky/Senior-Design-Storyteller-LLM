        "mainbody": "arach Hilthone was a servant of Gond during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIn 1356 DR, Barach and his companions from Tilvers Gap were traveling south of Daggerdale when they were attacked by a band of orcs. They fled into the nearby mountains and took refuge within an abandoned mountain fortress. They discovered a cache of treasure inside, including a glowing, magical sword but were chased out by an \"eye-covered monster\". When the group returned to Tilverton, a few members of the fighting band went missing and Barach refused to surrender the sword to the Temple of Gond Wondermaker, claiming it as his own loot."
