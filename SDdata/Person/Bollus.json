        "Activities": "Bollus was a caravaneer who originated from [[Calimport]] and owned a caravan business in [[Westgate]], who traveled up and down between the two cities. He was, however, so influenced by Westgate's customs that he stopped using [[Calishite naming conventions|his family and house names]]. His nickname, Copperteeth, derived from the particular predilection of Bollus for this metal, which he used in all forms and particularly to substitute four of his teeth. Some said, in contrast, that his nickname derived from his ability to convince traders to give him all their precious metal."
