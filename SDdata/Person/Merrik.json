        "mainbody": "'''Merrik''' was a loyal [[warrior]] of the [[Zhentarim]] operating from around the town of [[Y没lash]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Merrik showed no respect to Captain [[Haliator Mendara]] of the [[Red Plumes]], thinking him to be a poor fighter.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the Zhentarim became targeted by a mysterious [[Order of the Crippled Fang]]. The [[Shind Road]] that connected [[Hillsfar]] to the rest of the [[Moonsea]] region became swarmed by the [[fiend]]s in service to the cult. The creatures relentlessly attacked Zhentarim patrols and agents. Merrik and his fellow men were among those who stood against the fiends, and a [[shadow dragon]] [[Gloomfang]], leaving him bloodied, battered, and hurt but alive. The Zhent fighter reached the safety of Y没lash only to be arrested by Haliator Mendara and his Red Plumes as an enemy to the Red Plumes. Haliator toyed with the idea of executing Merrik where he stood but decided to take the Zhent prisoner, heal his wounds and have him stand trial in Y没lash."
