Jorid was a barkeep in in the village of Toralth in Tethyr in 1370 DR.
Jorid owned the Blue Badger Inn, a tavern situated in Toralth in northeastern Tethyr.
Before the Black Days, Jorid trained in the Tethyrian army.
On Uktar 10, 1370 DR, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered his taproom, seeking the Sondarr Scepter. When Bramas Thorntree accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Jorid was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers.
