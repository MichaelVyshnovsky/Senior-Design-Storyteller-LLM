{{quote|''We're not lost. Just taking in the view before continuing on our way.''|Drana Hoyte}}

==Description==
Drana was a [[lightfoot halfling]] woman with blue eyes, pale skin, and dark brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Filson Vago]] and his hin friend, Drana Hoyte, were visiting the city of Baldur's Gate during the looming threat of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Drana was convinced she knew how to navigate the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], and was unwilling to accept that they were lost. Filson, on the other hand, was very aware of their situation but still needed help finding a way in the busy warrens of the Lower City.
