        "Description": "Phostlethwaite was a bronze-skinned blonde [[gnome]] with blue eyes who wore gold-embroidered green finery. He was a lover of good [[pickle]]d [[ooze]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Stone Lord]] began threatening the Guild, and Nine-Fingers needed her old friend's and confidant's ear to pour her thoughts and feelings into. [[Tut Thistlebog]] was the Guildmaster's childhood friend and a heavy [[wine]] drinker. Keene was worried that the drunk [[hin]] would drunkenly run off and challenge the Stone Lord on his own. To protect her fried, Nine-Fingers ordered Phostlethwaite to keep the halfling soaked in wine and busy until the crisis was over. Phostlethwaite pretended to drink alongside Tut while keeping himself sober. When it was revealed that the Stone Lord was none other than [[Minsc]], a personal friend of Baldur's Gate's [[High Harper]], Tut Thistlebog may have revealed Nine-Fingers Keene's plans, with some persuasion from Phostlethwaite to the group of adventurers known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]]. Tut blabbed about Keene's plans to ambush her enemy in the [[Counting House]]'s vault to the group of adventurers known as the [[Absolute Adversaries]]."
