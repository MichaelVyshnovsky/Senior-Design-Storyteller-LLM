Phlydia was a resident of Candlekeep during the mid-14 century DR. She was somewhat absent-minded and couldnt stand being cooped up in the library for too long.
Phlydia was friends with the sage Gorion and was quite fond of his adopted child.
Phlydia wore a simple gold necklace and was adorned in a mage robe of fire resistance. She was armed with a mundane dagger.
In 1368 DR, Phlydia inattentively misplaced her copy of the History of Halruaa and was offering her gratitude and a lynx eye as the reward for the tomes return.
