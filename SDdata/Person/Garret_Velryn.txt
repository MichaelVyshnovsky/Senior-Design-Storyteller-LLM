Garret Velryn was a wilderness guide who lived in the Ten Towns during the late 15 century DR.
He was a skilled outdoorsman who felt more comfortable in the wilderness than in the city.
He was married to a man named Keegan, with whom he shared a home in Targos.
Garret grew up in a wealthy family that lived in Neverwinter. He did not care much for city life, and traveled north to Icewind Dale.
In the , Garret was hired by a group of adventurers to lead an expedition up to Kelvins Cairn. He met up with the party at Caer-Konig, and helped them buy the supplies they would need at Frozenfar Expeditions. Among the group were the goliath Mokingo Akannathi, a Yondallan halfling named Perilou Fishfinger, and a foul-mouthed tiefling called Astrix.
While they were traversing the mountain side, the group was attacked by a yeti and seperated from one another.
A few days later, his husband Keegan hired some adventurers to find Garrets whereabouts.
