After the man released Filaurel, he delivered the ''kiira'' unto Ornthalas; it bonded quickly, but painfully.\n\nOnce he bore the ''kiira'', Ornthalas was supportive of Elminster being taken before the [[Coronal]] so that no stain came upon the honor of their family.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor||5}}",
