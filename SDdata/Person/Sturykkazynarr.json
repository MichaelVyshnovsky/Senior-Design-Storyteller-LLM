        "Relationships": "One of his scions was named [[Vurkkazynarr]].",
        "History": "The ruler of several tribes of monsters and many blue dragons, as well as [[brown dragon]]s and even [[fang dragon]]s south of Solon, Sturykkazynarr was responsible for slaying Lord [[Yseldre]], the father of [[Tiphera tir-Yseldre]], after the latter's efforts to curb the wyrm's depredations finally aroused his ire. Sturykkazynarr personally slew Lord Yseldre, his family, and destroyed his home, leaving Tiphera as the only survivor, as she was at the capital training with sword and staff at the time.\n\nIn retaliation, Tiphera slew one of his scions, [[Vurkkazynarr]], fashioned a helmet from the younger dragon's skull as a challenge, and waged war against the wyrm for ten years. Eventually, the dragon was offered Tiphera by King [[Andizen]], who betrayed her and lured her directly into a trap in the [[Raurinshield]] mountains, under the pretense of celebrating her accomplishments. Though the wyrm prepared an ambush with a dozen dragons and managed to mortally wound his foe, Sturykkazynarr was slain by Tiphera and her allies in the fight."
