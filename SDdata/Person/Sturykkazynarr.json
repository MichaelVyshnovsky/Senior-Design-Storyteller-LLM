        "mainbody": "Sturykkazynarr was a blue dragon who ruled the desert Raurin south of Solon during the age of the Solonese empire.\nOne of his scions was named Vurkkazynarr.\nThe ruler of several tribes of monsters and many blue dragons, as well as brown dragons and even fang dragons south of Solon, Sturykkazynarr was responsible for slaying Lord Yseldre, the father of Tiphera tir-Yseldre, after the latters efforts to curb the wyrms depredations finally aroused his ire. Sturykkazynarr personally slew Lord Yseldre, his family, and destroyed his home, leaving Tiphera as the only survivor, as she was at the capital training with sword and staff at the time.\nIn retaliation, Tiphera slew one of his scions, Vurkkazynarr, fashioned a helmet from the younger dragons skull as a challenge, and waged war against the wyrm for ten years. Eventually, the dragon was offered Tiphera by King Andizen, who betrayed her and lured her directly into a trap in the Raurinshield mountains, under the pretense of celebrating her accomplishments. Though the wyrm prepared an ambush with a dozen dragons and managed to mortally wound his foe, Sturykkazynarr was slain by Tiphera and her allies in the fight."
