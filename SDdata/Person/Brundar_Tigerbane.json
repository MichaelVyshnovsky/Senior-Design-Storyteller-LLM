        "mainbody": "rundar Tigerbane was an adventurer and leader of the Wildmen of the North, a group that claimed the keep of Wild Hold as their own for a time.\nSome time around the early 12 century DR, Brunder led his fellows in an assault against the brigands of Farkeep. Claiming the castle as their own, and reinforcing its ancient architecture, they renamed their new home Wild Hold.\nAt some point, Brundar and most of the followers he attracted fell in battle, and Wild Hold changed hands to other masters."
