Phaen of the Rags was a lowly wizard of the Arcane Brotherhood and an ally of the Legion of the Chimera, active in the early 14 century DR.
Phaen claimed that he had committed some fatal mistake – the details of which he never shared with anyone – and as a result was cast out of the Arcane Brotherhood. He lost his robe, and he began wearing a robe of rags, helping him appear poor and nonthreatening. At some point before the , Phaen allied himself with the Legion of the Chimera that menaced the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. While still in Luskan, Phaen of the Rags met a band of "adventurers" from Cormyr, the Iron Collar Band, who had fled the the law in the Forest Kingdom. He promised the band easy coin that could be made in Targos, a town besieged by orcs and goblins of the Legion of the Chimera.
Phaen and the Iron Collar Band entered the employ of the Speaker of Targos, Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore. In secret from his traveling companions and the new employer, Phaen aided the Legion in smuggling goblin marauders into Targos by magical means. The invaders caused death and chaos but eventually were slain by a recently arrived band of adventurers from Luskan, later called the goblin slayers of Targos.
After recovering an expended scroll of magical transportation from a goblin sapper named Rukwurm, the goblin slayers tracked the vellum sheet to Phaen at the makeshift barracks where he was staying. He attempted to lie through his teeth to the group, but eventually abandoned the charade and attacked them with the aid of another band of goblins he conjured. Phaen did not survive the confrontation, and Lord Ulbrec rewarded Targoss new allies for exposing the saboteur.
Later events cast doubt on his story of expulsion from the Brotherhood. Beastmaster Harshom, who heavily implied that he was a current member of the Brotherhood, claimed that Phaen answered to him.
