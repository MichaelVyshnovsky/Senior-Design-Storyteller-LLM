'''Thundaerl''' was an archmage and chef of [[Tethyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
He developed spells. His latest spell as of around {{yearlink|1367}} was ''[[Thundaerl's universal taster]]''.

==Possessions==
He was rich.

==Relationships==
He was acquainted with [[Elminster Aumar]].

==History==
According to Elminster, he'd been an attendee of [[Magefair]]s at some point, his visits coinciding with [[Mordenkainen]] of [[Oerth]], and he had been the first archmage to labor as a chef in some king's court.

Some time around {{yearlink|1367}}, [[Elminster Aumar]] came across Thundaerl in the week before meeting with Mordenkainen and learned of his latest spell. Mordenkainen mentioned the [[Circle of Eight]] had paid him a visit once whilst in magical disguise; he described the pastries the man made as "excellent". Elminster mentioned Thundaerl had grown quite rich over the last dozen years in [[Selgaunt]] and devised a spell that revealed poison, ''Thundaerl's universal taster''.

In the {{yearlinkName|1370}}, Thundaerl returned to Tethyr, trying to take the post as the palace chef, but came into conflict with the current chef, [[Gisbertus]]. Thundaerl eventually became chef of the Great Hall, where he was in charge of feasts rather than day-to-day matters.
