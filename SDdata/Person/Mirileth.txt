'''Mirileth''' was a woman that lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
She was married to a man named [[Benryn]], who loved her very much..

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Mirileth and Benryn had a stay at [[Waukeen's Rest]], an inn situated along the [[Risen Road]]. Mirileth took with them a [[gold]] [[ring]], which was a dowry gift for Mirileth's sister's upcoming wedding. The two unfortunately got into an argument and were separated for a brief time.

The couple's trip met with disaster when [[goblin]] [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists]] slaughtered the inn's guests and set it ablaze. Mirileth was caught outside during the raid and forced into an isolated area. She was cut down and killed, unable to reunite with her husband in her final moments.
