During the {{yearlinkName|1106}}, the school was destroyed in a massive spell battle. Ulcaster disappeared during the confusion and was not seen since.\n\nThe ruins of the school lay on a hill to the east of Beregost and were said to be haunted. The local [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]] grazed their sheep near the ruins to keep an eye on things in the area.\n\n[[Gorion's Ward]] eventually met Ulcaster's ghost haunting his school.<ref>"
