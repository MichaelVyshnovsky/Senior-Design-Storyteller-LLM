Muthoth was a necromancer of the Red Wizards and a follower of the lich Szass Tam in the late 14 century DR.
Muthoth had sharp, haughty features. He had no fingers on his right hand, having lost them in a fight with the bard Bareris Anskuld.
He was often accompanied by his fellow necromancer So-Kehur.
Muthoth and his companion So-Kehur played a key role during the battle at the Keep of Sorrows by killing many opposing warriors with their dark magic, and raising them as undead to add to Szass Tams forces.
