He had torn up his copy of the agreement, and believed hed be hailed as a hero in Athkatla for giving Mirt the slip. Mirt reminded him there were still properties that could be seized by the law of Waterdeep, but Paraster proved unresponsive to the threat.\nDuring their conversation, Asper announced to Mirt that Laeral was there to see him Mirt told her that Laeral could see him, but only on her knees. She entered, begging for mercy, putting on a show for Paraster that Khelben Arunsun would do anything to square a debt he had, even allow him to mistreat Laeral. Paraster was suitably impressed, and relented on his intentions of leaving the debt unpaid. While he was leaving, Asper told him Maerilee Goodfellows scars were not from pirates, but from Mirts lashing Ieiridauna Amalree let out a horrifying undead shriek, pretending to be Laerals voice as Mirt tortured her for Khelbens alleged debt."
