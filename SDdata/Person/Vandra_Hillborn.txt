'''Vandra Hillborn''' was the leader of a community of [[dwarves]] that relocated to the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She famously led an expedition into the depths of [[Mount Hotenow]] to explore an [[Fireguard Fortress|newly-uncovered dwarfhold]] from ancient [[Delzoun]], in search of an entrance to fabled city of [[Gauntlgrym]],

==Relationships==
Vandra worked with a number of dwarven scholars, including [[Darney]] the geologist, the historian [[Thrimbul]], and a surveyor named [[Baera]].

==History==
Sometime during or before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Vandra Hillborn was elected as the leader among a large dwarven population that formed in Neverwinter. She helped her people set out on the Hillborn Expedition, a journey into Mount Hotenow to explore [[Fireguard Fortress]] in order find clues about [[Clan Hillborn]]'s ancestral home. During the expedition they encountered the forces of the mad [[fire giant]] [[Gommoth]], and helped how they could to stop the cult's disastrous scheme to reawaken the primordial [[Maegera]].

When members of the expedition unfortunately became separated from the rest of their dwarven brethren. Vandra worked with the [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to find the members of geologist Durney's team and gather information about the mines that were previously lost.
