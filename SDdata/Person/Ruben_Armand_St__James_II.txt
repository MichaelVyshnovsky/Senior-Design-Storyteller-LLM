Ruben Armand St. James II was a paladin of Tyr from Cormyr and one of the commanders of the Golden Gauntlets adventuring company.
Ruben was an archetypal paladin in manner, being brave, dutiful, and vigilant. He would not hesitate to charge into danger while shouting his devotion to Tyr.
He had a holy avenger bastard sword that he wielded with a magical shield, and wore a suit of field plate, a ring of spell turning, and a talisman of know alignment. He also had a pegasus mount.
In 1369 DR he was a guest at a royal party at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail alongside his dour companion Norrin Blackgrove, when their host Lord Partic Thistle appeared to be mysteriously murdered. As an upstanding paladin of Tyr, Ruben was considered above suspicion during the investigation.
