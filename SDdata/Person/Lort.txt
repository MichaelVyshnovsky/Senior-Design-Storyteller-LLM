'''Lort''' was a young crewmember aboard the [[hammership]], the ''[[Probe]]''.

==Description==
As a young man of about 20 years of age when [[Teldin Moore]] met him in [[1361 DR]], Lort was extremely thin. He had a hardened look to him like many a mercenary.

==Activities==
One of Lort's duties on the ''Probe'' was to help man the forecastle [[ballista]] turret.

==History==
On the journey from [[Krynn]] to [[Toril]], the ''Probe'' encountered a [[void scavver]] while Lort was at his gunner's post with a woman named [[Preema]]. On its first attack, the shark-like monster nearly bit Preema's arm off. When the scavver charged a second time, Lort drew his [[short sword]] and tried to plunge it into the scavver's head, but the monster twisted its head rapidly at the last moment and took the young man into its mouth, consuming him whole after several bloody bites. Teldin Moore recovered Lort's dropped sword and used the weapon to slay the monster with the assistance of his [[Cloak of the First Pilot|magical cloak]].
