        "mainbody": "Moire was a female half-elf who was a high-ranking member of the Shadow Thieves chapter in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.\nMoire was a notorious gang leader in Neverwinters Docks district, part of the Shadow Thieves chapter under Axle Devrie. Unlike Axle, she was known to be vicious and ruthless and she sought to hold the streets of Neverwinter in her grip.\nShe could have met the Kalach-Cha during the Shadow War. The Kalach-cha could have come into contact with Moire while trying to gain entrance to the Blacklake district.\nIf the Kalach-Cha and companions sided with the Watch, then they ruined many of Moires activities. During the rescue of the informant Fihelis, Moire herself showed up to kill the spy but was defeated.\nIf the Kalach-Cha and companions sided with the thieves, then they needed to help advance Moires activities, by working under her. Finally, the Kalach-Cha rose to work directly for Axle Devrie, the true leader of Neverwinters Shadow Thieves and a more diplomatic individual than Moire. Finally, Moire broke away from Axle and sought to take control of the Shadow Thieves, taking advantage of the chaos during the evacuation. The Kalach-Cha could resolve this situation either by killing her, killing Axle for her, or killing them both."
