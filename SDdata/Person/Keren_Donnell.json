        "Possessions": "Keren used a [[longbow]] as tall as a man made of black [[Callidyrr yew]]. It was one of a dozen or so weapons that were crafted by the High King's own bowyer. He had a falcon companion named [[Sable (falcon)|Sable]].",
        "History": "While visiting [[Gwynneth]] on official business for the [[High King]] of the Moonshaes in [[1345 DR]], he helped [[Tristan Kendrick]] and his companions in a fight against a band of [[firbolg]]s. They led him to [[Caer Corwell]] so he could speak to [[Bryon Kendrick|King Kendrick]]. On his way back to [[Caer Callidyrr]], he was captured by a band of firbolgs led by [[Groth]] and then rescued by Tristan, alongside [[Finellen]] the [[dwarf]] and [[Kamerynn]] the [[unicorn]]. It was at this time that Tristan found the legendary [[sword of Cymrych Hugh]].\n\nWith the discovery of the sword, Keren decided to stay with Tristan and company and began composing a ballad about the invasion and Tristan's journeys. Keren was influential in providing moral support to the armies as they battles Northmen at Freeman's Down and Caer Corwell. He also accompanied Tristan as he went to track-down the beast [[Kazgaroth]] after the failed battle at Caer Corwell. At this battle, Keren was disintegrated by the Beast, and his comrades [[Pawldo]] and [[Daryth]] were slain as well. The [[Earthmother]] was able to ressurrect everyone except for Keren, due his disintegration. In exchange, his ballad was spread to the minds of all the bards of the Moonshaes."
