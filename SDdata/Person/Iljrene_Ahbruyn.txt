'''Iljrene Ahbruyn''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Eilistraee]] and friend of [[Qilué Veladorn]].

==Description==
Iljrene, once described as a "tiny, kitten-soft doll of a priestess," was a drow of deceivingly soft, cuddly looks. She customarily concealed her magical surface [[elven chainmail]] beneath high-fashion gowns and sometimes went into [[Skullport]] with a basket over one slim arm to buy sundries (with backup guards shadowing her from behind, in case she needed aid). Few in Skullport bother her after she became known as the slayer of a [[Hired Horrors|Hired Horror]] who presumed too much apparent weakness in her.[[Ed Greenwood]] (December 1991). “If You Need Help - Ask the Drow!”. [[Dragon magazine 176|''Dragon'' #176]] ([[TSR, Inc.]]), p. 22

Iljrene collected stuffed toys and dolls, had been known to squeal with delight at a gift, joke, or flowery compliment, and could be embarrassingly affectionate. Those who mistook this "little girl" act for weakness often didn’t live long enough to regret it. In battle, she seemed immune to pain, her wits lighting-fast and her icy calm unshakable. [[Piergeiron Paladinson|Piergeiron]], Lord of Waterdeep, once called her "the most dangerous battlemaster I have ever laid eyes on in all Toril."

==Activities==
Iljrene was a priestess of Eilistraee in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] in [[Skullport]]. She was also the sub-commander of the [[Protectors of the Song]], the temple guards.

==History==
In [[1361 DR]], Qiluè agreed to help [[Liriel Baenre]] against the [[Vhaeraun]]-worshiping [[Dragon's Hoard]], sending her warriors, including Iljrene, to attack their headquarters.

By [[1375 DR]], Iljrene was one of the sub-commanders of the Protectors of the Song and held the rank of [[Hand of the Protectors]].
