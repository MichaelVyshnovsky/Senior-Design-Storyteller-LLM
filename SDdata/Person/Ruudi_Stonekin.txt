'''Ruudi Stonekin''' was a [[dwarf]] cartographer in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].

==Activities==
Ruudi sold her maps inside the [[Yawning Portal]] inn. She tried to approach all people who had knowledge about [[Undermountain]]'s structure and purchased for generous amounts maps of yet-unexplored sections of the dungeon. Ruudi also sold maps of the Yawning Portal, Waterdeep's streets, and all the public fountains in each of the city's wards.

==History==
Ruudi arrived at the Yawning Portal in only 1479 DR.

==Relationship==
Ruudi claimed to be related to [[Clan Melairkyn]].

==Personality==
Ruudi had a kind of map mania; people joked that she used a map even to to to the privy. She was friendly, enthusiastic, and generous with anyone who wanted to speak about maps or Undermountain-related topics but was truly uninterested about other topics.
