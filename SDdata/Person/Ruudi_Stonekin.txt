Ruudi Stonekin was a dwarf cartographer in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
Ruudi sold her maps inside the Yawning Portal inn. She tried to approach all people who had knowledge about Undermountains structure and purchased for generous amounts maps of yet-unexplored sections of the dungeon. Ruudi also sold maps of the Yawning Portal, Waterdeeps streets, and all the public fountains in each of the citys wards.
Ruudi arrived at the Yawning Portal in only 1479 DR.
Ruudi claimed to be related to Clan Melairkyn.
Ruudi had a kind of map mania people joked that she used a map even to to to the privy. She was friendly, enthusiastic, and generous with anyone who wanted to speak about maps or Undermountain-related topics but was truly uninterested about other topics.
