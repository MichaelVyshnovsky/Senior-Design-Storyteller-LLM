'''Burnice''' was a [[human]] child who grew up in the rebuilt town of [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Burnice was the daughter of one of Leilon's fishers. Her best friend was [[Smithwell]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], Leilon was attacked by the [[Cult of Talos]] and the townsfolk were driven out. Burnice and Smithwell were left behind in town and their parents were still out on the water. Luckily, a group of [[adventurers]] arrived just in time to reclaim the town. Both children were left unharmed.
