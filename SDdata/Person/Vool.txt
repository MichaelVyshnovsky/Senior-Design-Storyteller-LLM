Vool was a goblin werebat in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
Vool lived inside Wyllowwood. He plotted against Wyllow.
In 1492 DR, Vool made a series of attacks against the deer of the forest, raising the ire of Wyllow. So Mobar exiled Vool from the tribe.
Vool was in search of companionship but was an individual totally without honor or decency.
