'''Vool''' was a [[goblin]] [[werebat]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Vool lived inside [[Wyllowwood]]. He plotted against [[Wyllow]].

==History==
In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Vool made a series of attacks against the [[deer]] of the forest, raising the ire of Wyllow. So [[Mobar]] exiled Vool from the tribe.

==Personality==
Vool was in search of companionship but was an individual totally without honor or decency.
