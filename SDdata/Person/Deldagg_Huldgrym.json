        "mainbody": "'''Deldagg Huldgrym''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[adventurer]] who founded the [[Bloodaxe Mercenary Company]] around [[1317 DR]].",
        "History": "Deldagg was an outcast from [[Adbarrim]], known as a \"transgressor\" against the teachings of [[Moradin]], who led his fellow dwarven outcasts to form the Bloodaxe Mercenary Company. His organization was originally predominantly dwarven, and Deldagg and his troops distinguished themselves in conflicts with bandits, an army of [[orc]]s led by King [[Eldoul]], and raiders from [[Luskan]]. He lost many fellow dwarves during these battles, leading him to recruit [[human]]s and other races into the company from places like the [[Sword Coast]] (notably [[Baldur's Gate]]), the [[North]], the [[Vilhon Reach]], and [[Westgate]].\n\nDeldagg died in [[1331 DR]] of [[blacklung fever]] and was succeeded by [[Velkor Minairr]] as leader of the Bloodaxes."
