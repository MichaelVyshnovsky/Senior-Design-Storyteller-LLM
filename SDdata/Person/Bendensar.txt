'''Bendensar''' was a [[thief]], a former assistant in the [[thieves' guild]] of [[Mordulkin]], and a member of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] privateer fleet in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. ''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Bendensar was captain of the ''[[Sea Jewel]]''.

The Wraith were on a contract with [[Turmish]] when the ''Sea Jewel'' was scuttled by the former mercenary unit called the [[Agency]]. It sunk with all crew lost. The company was still waiting for Turmish to replace the loss of the ''Sea Jewel'' in the early 1360s DR.
