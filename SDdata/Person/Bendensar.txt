Bendensar was a thief, a former assistant in the thieves guild of Mordulkin, and a member of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateer fleet in the midâ€“14 century DR. Circa 1357 DR, Bendensar was captain of the Sea Jewel.
The Wraith were on a contract with Turmish when the Sea Jewel was scuttled by the former mercenary unit called the Agency. It sunk with all crew lost. The company was still waiting for Turmish to replace the loss of the Sea Jewel in the early 1360s DR.
