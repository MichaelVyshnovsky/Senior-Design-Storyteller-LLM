Dame Guisarme was a fighter-adventurer and a mercenary patron of the Elfsong Tavern from the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Guisarme was a gold dwarf woman with pale skin, brown eyes, and long blonde hair. She kept her face clean-shaven and her hair styled. She wore a set of mundane half plate armor and was armed with a simple longsword and a shield.
Dame Guisarme was barbarian Bombastos traveling companion, with whom he seemed to have a flirtatious and friendly-antagonistic relationship. She thought the barbarians schemes and ideas were crazy but ended up getting involved in them anyway, but not before receiving a compliment from Bombasto and responding to it with a slap.
In the , Dame Guisarme was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldurs Gate. She was often seen dining or enjoying drinks with her mercenary adventuring companion, Bombasto. They liked to discuss the Flaming Fist mercenaries and commander Liara Portyrs inability to stop the rampant murders in the Gate. Dame Guisarme offered Commander Portyr her services but, evidently, was turned down. Guisarme was sure that the Flaming Fists would eventually fail to stop the murders and Liara Portyr would end up asking Guisarmes help.
One of Bombastos adventures was his and Dame Guisarmes stand against hobgoblin raiders who held a wagonload of beer. Bombasto was thirsty and suggested the adventurers trade a wagonload of donkey shit for the hobgoblins beer. Despite Dame Guisarme considering the idea crazy, Bombasto went on pushing a wagon of manure off a hill. It rolled down and pushed the hobgoblins cart of beer forward, slaying in its place. Guisarme grabbed the beer wagon down in a ravine.
During their time at the Elfsong Tavern, Bombasto and Guisarme contemplated accepting a job in East Chult, guarding extractive safari out of Fort Beluarian with bonuses paid to all survivors.
