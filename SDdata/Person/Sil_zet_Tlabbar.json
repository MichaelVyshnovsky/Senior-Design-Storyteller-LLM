        "History": "Sil'zet was the oldest and favorite daughter of Ghenni. In [[1372 DR]], Ghenni was targeted by [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] as part of his bargain with [[House Agrach Dyrr]], who wanted Ghenni dead. Nimor infiltrated the Faen Tlabbar complex and unfortunately Sil'zet was at her mother's side at that time, so Nimor killed both Ghenni and Sil'zet."
