        "mainbody": "Silzet Tlabbar was the favorite daughter of Ghenni Tlabbar, matron mother of House Faen Tlabbar, the fourth house of Menzoberranzan until the Silence of Lolth.\nSilzet was the oldest and favorite daughter of Ghenni. In 1372 DR, Ghenni was targeted by Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin as part of his bargain with House Agrach Dyrr, who wanted Ghenni dead. Nimor infiltrated the Faen Tlabbar complex and unfortunately Silzet was at her mothers side at that time, so Nimor killed both Ghenni and Silzet."
