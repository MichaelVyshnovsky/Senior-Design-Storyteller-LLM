        "mainbody": "'''Khan Zohrin-Ka''', was a wealthy [[dao]] merchant of [[Calimport]], active in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Khan Zohrin-Ka became a character in a legendary cautionary tale of [[Mujibar]] the Foolish. In the {{YearlinkName|1298}}, Mujibar, drowning in gambling debt, sought [[coin]] from the wealthy merchant dao. The djinn offered Mujibar a gamble – a simple card game of chance. If Mujibar won, all of his debts would be paid off. If Zohrin-Ka won, then the rogue would owe the djinn his soul.\n\nThe game was quite simple, later known as the [[game set of Mujibar the Foolish]]. The winner had to draw a smaller sum of cards. The game started with Khan rolling \"2\" and drawing \"7\" and \"4\". When Mujibar rolled, his result was \"10,\" and he carefully drew ten cards from the deck without looking at the numbers and not showing them to the opponent. To everyone's shock – the rogue pulled all cards marked with \"1\", making the total less than that of the djinni.\n\nImmediately relieved by [[Tymora]]'s favor, Mujibar demanded his winnings. Khan was enraged, convinced the rogue stacked the deck and cheated. Khan Zohrin-Ka was honor-bound to pay, but the agreement said nothing about Mujibar being alive to enjoy the [[coin]]. The dao sun his [[scimitar]] and ended the rogue's life. The dead gambler's pockets were filled with the winning money, and his body was dumped in a shady alley in Calimport.\n\nAfter three days, Mujibar's body was still in the alley. His pockets were empty but surrounded by thousands of [[ale]] bottles. The alley was decorated with remnants of a party of legendary proportions, still told by Calimport's drunks well into the late 14{{th}} century DR. Poor and drunks of Calimshan were hopeful for another Mujibar the Foolish."
