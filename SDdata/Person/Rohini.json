        "mainbody": "'''Rohini''' was a [[succubus]] working for the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] in [[Neverwinter]] and [[Helm's Hold]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Appearance": "Rohini usually took the guise of an attractive, middle-aged female [[human]], but not so beautiful as to distract or bring anxiety to anyone who spoke with her.",
        "Personality": "Rohini was highly intelligent and manipulative, and was a consummate seductress.\n\nIn her guise of the Prophet, she was a selfless humanitarian and her laughter was infectious. Her presence was able to set people at ease, and people always felt they could trust her.",
        "Relationships": "Rohini had a sister, [[Arunika]], who was also a succubus and also worked to pave a way into Neverwinter for the Sovereignty. However, she had died before Rohini was sent to Neverwinter.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle}}",
        "Abilities": "As she was fused with the [[Hex Locus]] in an intrinsic, symbiotic way, Rohini had the ability to see into the [[Weave]] to predict the future.",
        "History": {
            "Neverwinter (game)": "While serving the Sovereignty, Rohini was also a double agent working on behalf of the [[Ashmadai]] to convert the spellscarred to their service. With this local increase in membership, the Ashmadai seized Helm's Hold. This in turn drew the attention of the [[Neverwinter Guard]], who laid siege to the village. Rohini's plan all along having been to expose the Ashmadai and have the forces of Neverwinter engage the cult so that the two were preoccupied with each other.In the MMO, Rohini has a different story than in the official adventures.\n\nEventually, when the Ashmadai revealed themselves, Rohini temporarily became de facto ruler of the Hold until she showed her true colors and was forced to flee to the cathedral by a band of adventurers from Neverwinter. They followed her and eventually banished her to the [[Nine Hells]]."
        },
        "Trivia": "Rohini \"predicted\" the return of [[Helm]] to earn the trust of the inhabitants of Helm's Hold. Albeit unintentionally, her predictions turned to be true, as Helm was resurrected during the [[Second Sundering]]."
