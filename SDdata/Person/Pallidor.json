        "mainbody": "'Pallidor''' was a [[wizard]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1485 DR]].",
        "History": "Pallidor was the apprentice of [[Vaelish Gant]] and a fellow member of reformed [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. He followed his master in his plot to conquer Icewind Dale but after arriving in [[Bryn Shander]], Pallidor abandoned Vaelish, following a voice that called to him.\n\nUnder the voice's instruction, Pallidor recruited [[Baerick Hammerstone]] and his crew to make excavations in [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. There they discovered first [[black ice]] and later the corpse of [[Akar Kessell]]. Kessel, risen as a [[wight]], explained that he was the voice that had guided Pallidor and possessed the young wizard to use as his vessel.\n\nPallidor likely died when an adventuring party defeated Kessel for good."
