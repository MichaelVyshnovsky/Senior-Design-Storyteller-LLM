'''Oretheo Spikes''' was a member of, and later the leader of, the [[Wilddwarf Brigade]]; a [[battlerager]] brigade from [[Citadel Adbar]].

==History==
Oretheo was a member of the Wilddwarf Brigade in [[1484 DR]]. In the same year, he was present, together with his leader [[Crunch]], when an Adbar expedition led by King [[Bromm]] was attacked by [[orc]]s of the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]]. King Bromm was killed by [[Hartusk]] in the attack; Crunch's fate was unknown. Oretheo however survived and became the leader of the Wilddwarves and later took part in all the major battles of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in [[1485 DR]]. Oretheo also led his brigade in the reconquest of [[Gauntlgrym]].
