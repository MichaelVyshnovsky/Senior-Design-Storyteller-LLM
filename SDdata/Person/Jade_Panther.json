        "mainbody": "Jade Panther was an infamous monk from the nation of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, active some years before the late 14 century DR.\nJade Panthers infamy came from the use of special gloves—the Claws of the Jade Panther—that were adorned with razor-sharp blades to savage his opponents more effectively. Finally, Jade Panthers consort, Li Mei, grew disgusted with the monks cruelty, stole the Claws of the Jade Panther, and tasked her servant with destroying the gloves once and for all. But Jade Panthers torturous implements were not destroyed, and, instead, ended up on the black market."
