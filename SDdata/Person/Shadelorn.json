        "History": "The eager Shadelorn inhabited [[Shadowtop Borough]], a [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] that held a friendly community of [[arcanist]]s and archwizards. Shadelorn achieved much during his life, and even accomplished feats that several other archwizards were unable to achieve. In {{YearlinkConvert|3215|NY}}, he finally rediscovered the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'', after others had spent centuries searching for it. Shadelorn even trumped [[Ioulaum]] by discovering the key to producing powerful mythallars in {{YearlinkConvert|3517|NY}}."
