'''Barking Seal''' was the village chieftain of the [[Ice Hunters]] that dwelled on the isle of [[Oyaviggaton]] as of the 1480s [[DR]].{{ToD-time}}

==Relationships==
He had a strong bond with his village's shaman [[Bonecarver]]. Together the two did all the speaking to outsiders for their people.

If any outlander refused to leave their home, Barking Seal would propose the village's champion [[Orcaheart]]. If Orcaheart won, the Ice Hunters would receive any of the visitors' more finely-crafted weapons.

==History==
Some time in the 1480s DR, Barking Seal and Bonecarver greeted a band of adventurers from the [[Sword Coast]] at their village.
