Barking Seal was the village chieftain of the Ice Hunters that dwelled on the isle of Oyaviggaton as of the 1480s DR.
He had a strong bond with his villages shaman Bonecarver. Together the two did all the speaking to outsiders for their people.
If any outlander refused to leave their home, Barking Seal would propose the villages champion Orcaheart. If Orcaheart won, the Ice Hunters would receive any of the visitors more finely-crafted weapons.
Some time in the 1480s DR, Barking Seal and Bonecarver greeted a band of adventurers from the Sword Coast at their village.
