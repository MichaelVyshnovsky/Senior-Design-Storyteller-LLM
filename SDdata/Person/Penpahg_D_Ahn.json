        "Teachings": "Penpahg taught a powerful martial art based around unarmed combat, with many strikes, kicks, locks, and wrestling maneuvers.\n\nIt had a philosophy of strict personal discipline and [[lawful]] behavior, married with physical training in order to attain harmony of the soul and complete control of the body and very being. Danica considered that while [[elves]] might have the physical grace and control necessary, they might lack the focused discipline required.<ref> It required meditative practices, martial arts training, concentration techniques, and channeling the hidden powers of the body. Those who studied it often dedicated themselves to it completely. However, the tests and training could be deadly.\n\nOne extreme test of discipline was called Iron Skull, or Gigel Nugel, a maneuver that allowed one to break through stone using just their head. The test was involved, taking many minutes of concentration and clearing the mind of distractions, chanting and motions to harmonize body and spirit, and mentally challenging the stone itself to convince the practitioner they would succeed.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = It is a test of discipline, as are all of Grandmaster Penpahg D'Ahn's teachings. The grandmaster was in control of his body, of his very being.\n| source = Danica's description of Penpahg D'Ahn\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n}}\nThe practitioner developed keen senses and with concentration and meditation, they could notice unseen and invisible beings and identify traps. By entering a meditative trance, they could even [[true seeing|see things as they truly were]], though this took four hours to achieve and lasted for only two.\n\nAlso through meditation, they could control their bodily functions, to limit injury and slow bleeding, and in effect partly heal their wounds. Danica expanded on this, adapting the technique for coming out of suspension to restart a [[heartstop|stopped heart]] in another by [[Wikipedia:Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|striking the chest]].\n\nPenpahg's scrolls were labelled with pictograms: crossed fists signified a combat technique, an open eye signified a concentration technique.",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "Penpahg's teachings lived on, being practiced by his small and secretive monastic order and recorded in rare and precious scrolls. The Edificant Library in [[Erlkazar]] had acquired a collection by the mid–14{{th}} century DR. However, he and his practice remained barely known in western Faerûn.\n\nIn the 1350s DR, Master Turkel Bastan, a Tabotan monk and follower of the long-dead grandmaster who had settled in [[Westgate]], taught the martial art to his apprentice, Danica Maupoissant. ''Circa'' [[1360 DR]], having taught her all he could, he bade her travel to the Edificant Library to learn directly from the scrolls kept there.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = You cannot resist, I am the stronger. You are parchment, and I am the stronger.\n| source = Danica's challenge to the stone\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n}}\nFrom then on, Danica dedicated herself to mastering Penpahg's techniques and philosophies. though she later attempted it alone, repeatedly, and injured herself.
