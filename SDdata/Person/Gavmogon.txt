'''Gavmogon''', also known as the '''angry eye god''' to some of his lesser minions,{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|10-11}} was a [[beholder]] who had been transformed into a [[mindwitness]] following his enslavement to a colony of [[mind flayer]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|53}}{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|52}} He menaced the region around [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], even coming to be seen as a threat among the [[fey]] and the other beholders in the area.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|49}}{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|25}}

==Description==
He had a large, glowing central eye around which danced his four smaller eyes.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|42}}

==Personality==
Gavmogon was mentally unstable and driven by a need for revenge against his mind flayer captors, which turned into a wish to destroy all other creatures that would not bend to his will. He was drunk on his own power and prone to gloating.

==Possessions==
Gavmogon controlled a massive [[artifact]] known as the ''[[hollow of dominion]]'', an underground chamber that channeled [[psionics|psychic energy]] to allow the wielder to commune with the minds of everything within {{SI|30|miles|k|long=yes}}{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|50}} Naturally, Gavmogon was highly protective of his control over the ''hollow of dominion'' and especially of its control device, the ''[[dominion rod]]''.

==Activities==
Gavmogon worked to exert his will over the Phandalin region, believing that he had to prove his superiority by annihilating the minds of everything around him. He agitated monsters, spread madness, and caused chaos. His presence could be detected by some creatures in the form of "eyes in the sky".

==History==
Gavmogon was enslaved by the [[elder brain]] of a mind flayer colony based out of a crashed [[nautiloid]] in the [[Sword Mountains]], who transformed him into a mindwitness and gave him potent psychic powers. He managed to escape from the mind control in the late 15{{th}} century DR upon discovering the ''hollow of dominion'', which held far greater power than the elder brain. He soon began projecting his influence on the region, leading to strange magical occurrences and more aggressive monsters. The magical disturbances he caused had the effect of attracting a coven of [[hag]]s to the area, intrigued by the mysterious powers that were disturbing the fey in the region.

Gavmogon personally extended his control over monsters of [[Crooked Forest]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|17}} At one point while there, he came across and nearly wiped out a tribe of [[goblin]]s. The survivors came to revere him as a [[god]]&mdash;their "angry eye god"&mdash;even as he abandoned them. The tribe took on the name of the [[Angry Eye]], and performed sacrifices in the name of their god as they awaited his return.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|16}} During one of his trips to the Forest, we was briefly glimpsed by one of the gnolls' captives, [[Alana Hallwinter]].

About a year after his initial escape from the mind flayers,{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|38}} This had the result of driving out a group of [[yuan-ti]] lairing in the mountains,{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|33}} who began conducting [[human]] sacrifices at a quarry near the [[Old Owl Well]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|31}}

Gavmogon next began to enact his plan to use the ''hollow of dominion'' to inflict madness upon the town of Phandalin and the monsters in the surrounding area.{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|51}}
