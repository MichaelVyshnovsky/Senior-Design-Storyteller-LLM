        "mainbody": "'''Yrberop''' was a [[myconid]] and leader of the [[Circle of Sporers]] in [[Neverlight Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Yrberop was easily seduced when [[Zuggtmoy]]'s will twisted most of the Circle ''circa'' [[1486 DR]]. It began creating more and more myconid sprouts.",
        "Personality": "Because of Zuggtmoy's influence, Yrberop always swayed to a music that only it could hear, and those in tune with the myconid could hear a faint echo. Yrberop was excited for [[Phylo]]'s plans to spread the will of [[Zuggtmoy]] throughout the [[Underdark]]. Due to its madness, Yrberop forgot all conversations after they ended."
