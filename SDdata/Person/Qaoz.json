        "Activities": "Qaoz was said to have led a community of [[mind flayer]]s somewhere in the [[Underdark]].",
        "History": "According to ''The Enticing Elder'', Qaoz was once approached by two sisters, one a fearsome warrior and the other a stalwart [[cleric]]. After killing many of Qaoz' illithid servitors, the sisters sought to slay Qaoz, each for their own reasons. The warrior wanted to end Qaoz' 'tyranny' and slay the elder brain, while the cleric sought to harness its powers for herself.\n\nQaoz took but a moment to consider the sisters and their declarations. It then used its profound [[psionic]] abilities to slay each of them in short order. The surviving mind flayer's of Qaoz' colony then feasted on the sisters' remains."
