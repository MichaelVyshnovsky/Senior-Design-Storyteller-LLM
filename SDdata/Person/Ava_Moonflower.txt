Ava Moonflower was a moon elf of House Moonflower long before the Crown Wars of the ancient realm Aryvandaar. She was also a mighty High Mage and served as a center for the high magic rituals. She was married to the sun elf Rolim Durothil shortly before both traveled the ocean with many elves to the island of Evermeet. Their marriage was arranged, because her husband had little magical aptitude to pass it down to his children and his father wanted his new wife to bring that into his family. At the beginning of the voyage both had their problems with that arrangement but during the travel they learned to respect and love each other.
Four hundred years later, after the death of the High Council, Keishara Amarillis and Rolim became the new High Council of Evermeet. Rolim and Ava had an unusually large family. The children who came after their father became part of house Durothil, the others became part of house Moonflower.
