'''May Winfield''' was an inhabitant of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
May Winfield was a wife and a mother of twelve, beloved by all. She died in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, shortly before the armies of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] attacked the city of Baldur's Gate. May's tombstone was commissioned to be carved by [[Candulhallow's Tombstones]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. Her freshly-carved grave marker read: "May Winfield. Mother of twelve, wife of one. Beloved by all." The completed headstone was stored in Candulhallow's shop' main room, just past the main entrance, to the left.
