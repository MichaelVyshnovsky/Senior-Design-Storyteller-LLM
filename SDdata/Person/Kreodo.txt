'''Kreodo''', nicknamed the "Sea Queen", was a [[half-orc]] [[fighter]] and [[thief]] and the leader of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] mercenary company and privateer fleet in [[Chessenta]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Kreodo was originally a slave of a [[Flaming Spike]] [[orc]] tribe in the [[Akanapeaks]], but she escaped and went to the city of [[Reth]]. This was the start of a long career and many adventures.

Later, in [[Mordulkin]], she joined the local [[thieves' guild]]. However, feeling she'd rather live on the seas, she bought a ship and hired a crew and decided to become a pirate.

She went on to form and take command of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateering company, which had been long-standing by [[1357 DR]].''Gold & Glory'' says the Wraith were "a long-standing fleet", suggesting it might predate Kreodo's leadership, but from ''Old Empires'' it may be inferred it began with Kreodo first setting up a pirate. Thus this article assumed Kreodo founded the Wraith and has been leading it for a long time. They were still active in the early 1360s DR, when Kreodo was still waiting for [[Turmish]] to replace the loss of the ''[[Sea Jewel]]''.

==Activities==
As leader of the Wraith of the Inner Sea, Kreodo commanded four ships that plied the Chessentan coast, [[Wizards' Reach]], and [[Inner Sea]]. She herself captained the [[dromond]] also named ''[[Sea Queen]]'', the flagship of the fleet. Her first mate was Rutters. Her flag was a black crown on a blood-red field. She commanded with a typical naval hierarchy, and her officers obeyed her orders.

==Personality==
Kreodo was cruel and even vicious to her foes, but she was normally courteous and kind to the victims of her attacks. She ensured that people who surrendered to her would be treated well before they were returned to their homes such as for a ransom.

==Description==
Kreodo had almost fully [[human]] features and had long black hair and blue eyes (which were very rare in a half-orc).
