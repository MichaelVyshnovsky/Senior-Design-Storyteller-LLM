        "mainbody": "Acuakvacaesin was a peaceful green dragon residing in the Moonshae Isles.\nAcuakvacaesin had a great respect for the natural world, was largely disinterested in the affairs of humanoids, and was desirous of a peaceful life. He held great disdain for his fellow green dragons and their evil ways.\nHe preferred to use magic to exist for as much time as possible in the form of either his wood elf alias, Caesin a fey creature or as a woodland animal.\nThe mere sight of drow, orcs, or chromatic dragons would drive Caesin into a rage, whereupon he would drop any magical disguises that he was wearing, and attack them in his full glory.\nAs a mature adult green dragon, he had the powers and abilities of such a creature, including the natural ability to breathe underwater and expel a cloud of poisonous breath. Additionally, Caesin could cast several sorcerer spells, which he used in combat, and to polymorph himself.\nCaesins hoard was small, and consisted of only copper and silver coins, plus a few magic items. Said items included a cloak and boots of elvenkind, as well as a +3 holy dragonbane longsword.\nAcuakvacaesin spent his waking hours mostly patrolling Myrloch Vale under a magical disguise in an attempt to root out evil or those who would try to breach the security of Synnoria.\nIn his elven form, Caesin was permitted to move freely among the Llewyrr elves of Synnoria. Of these elves, he was closest to a scout named Numira, who was one of the few Llewyrr who knew his true identity. Caesin was secretly in love with Numira.\nAcuakvacaesin came to Gwynneth in an attempt to remove himself from his own evil kin, and find peace in the resplendence of the natural world. Unfortunately, he was attacked and nearly killed by both Ffolk and Northlander humans. However, although he emerged victorious from these battles, he refused to kill any of his opponents, and did not demand their treasures, even in recompense. A band of Llewyrr scouts, led by a woman named Numira, observed these battles from afar. Taking the form of a young elf himself, Caesin approached the scouts, and after many months of talking with them, discovered that he was not far from their home city of Synnoria. Numira had seen through Caesins magical disguise but had not told anyone as she didnt want to see this curious green dragon harmed by her peers.\nEventually the elf Caesin was permitted entrance to Synnoria.\nCaesin took up the faith of the local goddess known as the Earthmother. Although his faith in her and her tenets were true, he also wished that the goddess would permanently transform him into his elven alias so that he could safely declare his love for Numira without risking her becoming pregnant with a half-dragon who might inherit his kins predilection for evil."
