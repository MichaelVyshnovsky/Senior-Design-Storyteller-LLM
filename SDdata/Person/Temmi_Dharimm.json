        "Activities": "Temmi the Slaver was highly discreet and very careful. The humans and [[demihuman]]s he caught were securely bound in manacles, blindfolded and gagged, then chained by collars around their throats to a coffle-bar (a long tree-trunk that a group of slaves were forced to carry).\n\nHe operated around the [[Elven Woods]], the [[Moonsea]], the [[Dalelands]], and the Vast.",
        "Relationships": "Temmi was aided by a small force of trained monsters. These were two [[disenchanter]]s, three [[dire wolf|dire wolves]], and six [[bloodhawk]]s.",
        "History": "Temmi Dharimm was native to Tsurlagol. However, he went on to spend many years working hard as a bandit around the Moonsea. In that time, he accumulated by some means his force of trained monsters.\n\nBy [[1357 DR]], Temmi had based himself in the Elven Woods near [[Hillsfar]] and began taking captives and selling them into slavery. They were sold to the [[Zhentarim]] or other agents of [[Zhentil Keep]], who took them north in covered wagons.\n\nTemmi was still carrying on his cruel trade [[1367 DR|ten years later]]. He intended to expand his business and was on the look-out for employees with similar ways."
