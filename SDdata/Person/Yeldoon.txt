'''Yeldoon''' was an [[undead]] being in [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
Yeldoon was the third son of a noble in a faraway city. After a scandal, he was exiled and settled in [[Waterdeep]]. In time, by gambling the money he received from his family, Yeldoon became a rich man. He sponsored some adventuring parties to explore [[Undermountain]]. However, he somehow acquired a [[curse]]d item that transformed his interest in the dungeon into a true obsession.

In [[1363 DR]], Yeldoon died and according to his last wishes he was buried in a crypt inside the second level of Undermountain. Somehow, thanks to the cursed item, he rose as an [[undead]] and created other undead around him. Yeldoon's corpse rose as a [[wight]] and his spirit rose as an [[allip]].

In 1375 DR, his dying father expressed a wish to see his son again, not knowing about Yeldoon's death. He sent two nephews, [[Eurikos]] and [[Phariseus]], to Waterdeep to find him. When Eurikos and Phariseus discovered Yeldoon's story, they tried to find someone to recover the wealth inside Yeldoon's crypt.

==Activities==
Yeldoon resided inside his crypt with all his wealth and his cursed item. His wight and allip were linked and perfectly coordinated.

==Personality==
Yeldoon was a charismatic man with an interest in Undermountain. In his undead state, he agreed to give some pieces of his treasure, including the cursed item, to his family.
