Nilat was an elven ranger.
He had tan skin, and long, dark hair braided on one side. His eyes were green, and he wore dark clothing.
Nilat enjoyed playing practical jokes on others.
Nilat clad himself in elven chain mail, and carried a magical longsword and longbow in battle. He also owned a ring of free action.
Growing up as the third son of a lord, Nilat found he had no future as a noble and instead began working as a scout and hunter, naming himself a "guardian of the people." His penchant for practical jokes annoyed his family, who considered him their black sheep.
