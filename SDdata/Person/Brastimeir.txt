'''Brastimeir''', also known as '''Brastimeir the Bold''', was a mage who challenged [[the Simbul]] prior to {{yearlink|1262}}. She won, and Brastimeir perished.

==Legends & Rumors==
In {{yearlink|1262}}, [[Elminster Aumar]] judged that [[the Simbul]]'s slaying of mages, whether from [[Thay]] or not, had become excessive, and the feats of her power were tilting the balance of power around [[Aglarond]]. Amongst other mages slain, he counted Brastimeir the Bold.
