        "mainbody": "The '''Lost Messenger''' was a [[ghost]] that could be found wandering the [[Battle of Bones]].",
        "Description": "The Lost Messenger appeared as a transparent young boy.",
        "Activities": "Each night at the three o'clock hour, the Lost Messenger wandered both sides of the battlefield for five minutes before disappearing, almost as if he was still trying to deliver his fateful message.",
        "History": "Though his real name remained unknown, the Lost Messenger served as a messenger between commanders of the human army during the actual Battle of Bones in [[1090 DR]]. Minutes before the initial clash of forces, the young boy became lost in the darkness and wavered in front of the assembled mass of [[Izac Uthor]]'s horde of [[goblin]]s and [[orcs]]. Claiming first blood of a battle was very important to the goblinkind. The boy was run down as Uthor's army surged forward.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "The Lost Messenger appeared on occasion in the court of King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]]. [[Vangerdahast]] was confused by these seemingly random visits, but the [[priest]]s of [[Tyr]] believed the Messenger appeared seeking to blame [[Artur Blevin]], or one of his living ancestors, for his death."
