        "mainbody": "'''Shandagara''' was a [[human]] woman and a pirate operating on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in [[Interior Faer没n|central Faer没n]].",
        "History": "In [[1359 DR|the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], Shandagara disappeared, leaving her treasure-laden ship abandoned in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The likely explanation was that some [[magic]] had whisked her away.\n\nAfter mid-autumn of that year, traders spotted a human warrior woman of similar manner fighting alongside the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Earthfast]], and some speculated that this was Shandagara. However, she later turned out to be [[Alusair Obarskyr|another woman]].",
        "Personality": "As a so-called pirate \"queen\", Shandagara acted like it and had a hot temper.",
