Often often korobokuru and sometimes even wandering spirit folk asked her counsel about all kinds of issues, including business enterprises and marriages. \nSen possessed the Mantle of Forest Spirits, a mantle woven from feathers, down, with every animal of the forest having contributed a tiny piece. The mantle permitted her to ask for omens and advice from any of the forests creatures."
