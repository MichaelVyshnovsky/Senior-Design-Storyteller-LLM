'''Flarm''' was a [[chapbook]] author in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Over splendid food in luxurious surroundings, bright young ambitious things mingle with jaded nobles and urbane courtiers, fluted wineglasses in hand, discussing the morrow of Cormyrâ€”and jockeying for power in that future.''|[[Flarm]], in a chapbook from the {{YearlinkName|1478}}}}
