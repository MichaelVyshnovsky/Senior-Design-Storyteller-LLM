Tracker '''Nik-Nuk''' was a devoted novice in the [[Cult of the Absolute]] who served her goddess at the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|The Blade? Spike's seen him fight - says he's a pussycat. If'n he'd cross me, I'd crack open his skull and scoop out his brains.|Nik-Nuk.}}

==Description==
Nik-Nuk had yellow-green skin and notably long ears. She wore her red-orange hair over to one side and decorated her face in white war paint.

==Possessions==
While she wore mostly simple clothes under a cracked leather vest, Nik-Nuk also protected herself with a few pieces of salvaged armor. In proud display, she wore an amulet bearing the [[holy symbol]] of [[the Absolute]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Nik-Nuk and other members of the cult launched a devastating raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn. They slew many innocents, along with [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers, and took the captives that remained to the cult's fortress of [[Moonrise Towers]].

After the raid, Nik-Nuk and two other cultists, [[Crub]] and [[Plagg]], fantasized about how they would kill the adventurer [[Wyll]], the self-proclaimed "Blade of Frontiers".
