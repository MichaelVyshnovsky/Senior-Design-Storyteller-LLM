Since Sarevok is fully human and his and Helena's daughter Orin is a changeling, this implies Helena was a half-doppelganger or changeling. Given Sarevok's association with doppelganger agents, it seems likely one of these is intended to be Helena's mother.

'''Helena Anchev''' was a [[Bhaalspawn]] and a devoted follower of [[Bhaal]] who served her god during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Helena was born to an unknown female doppleganger and [[Sarevok Anchev]], a Bhaalspawn. Helena worshiped and loved Sarevok and had a child, [[Orin]], with her own father. Sarevok in turn claimed to love Helena and Orin, presumably as the "heritors of his essence".
{{Quote|I loved her [Orin] as I loved her mother. One born from the other, both heritors of my essence. Bhaal never had a more fecund offering than I sowed on his behalf. Bhaal's seed must be sown throughout the land that He might wreak murder on the world entire.|Sarevok Anchev}}

==History==
However, Sarevok told Helena that Orin must be her offering in order to become Bhaal's [[Chosen]]. Helena attempted to kill her daughter, but Orin killed Helena first. Helena's corpse was put on display in Orin's room in the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Temple of Bhaal]] and was still there by [[1492 DR]].
