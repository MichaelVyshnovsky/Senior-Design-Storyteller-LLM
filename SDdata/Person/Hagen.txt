Hagen was a merchant of Neverwinter in the 1370s DR.
Since bandits and thugs threatened him to give away gold for them, Hagen lost his trust with the Neverwinter Watch. If the Kalach-Cha sided with the Watch to dispose of the thieves, Hagen repaired his standing with the Watch. If the Kalach-Cha sided with the thieves, Hagen would still give away the gold. However, he would reappear in front of Caleb and have the Watchmen attack him and the Kalach-Cha.
