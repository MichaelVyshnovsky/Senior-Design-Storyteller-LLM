'''Dhairn''' was a [[drow]] [[drow judicator|judicator]] of [[Selvetarm]].

==History==
Dhairn was part of a group of drow exiled from [[Eryndlyn]] for worshiping Selvetarm as a deity on its own instead of a servant of [[Lolth]].

In [[1375 DR]], Dhairn went to recruit a large group of [[drider]]s living in the [[Underdark]] under the [[Misty Forest]] for membership in the [[Selvetargtlin]].

Later, when various groups of Underdark monsters, including [[chitine]], [[neogi]], [[drider]]s, and [[spellgaunt]]s attacked all of [[Eilistraee]]'s shrines on the surface, Dhairn led the main force of Selvertargltlin to attack the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]]. He killed [[Iljrene Ahbruyn|Iljrene]], dissolving her body into a writhing mass of spiders and fought well against [[Qilu√© Veladorn]].

However, at last, in the [[Demonweb Pits]], [[Cavatina Xarann]] killed Selvetarm himself. Dhairn fell confused and powerless without the power of his god. He was trying to escape when Qilue's blade skewered his back.
