'''Crimdrac''' was a [[dracolich]] ally of Dracandros in [[Battledale]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Personality==
Crimdrac was basically a compulsive liar: he tried to claim as his own all kinds of exploit made by a [[dragon]] in the [[Dragon Reach]]. He planned to betray Dracandros after the Red Wizard had taught him magic.

==History==
Crimdrac was a [[red dragon]] dracolich created by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. However, he allied with the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[Dracandros]] for the chance to learn [[spell]]s.

Crimdrac was killed by the adventuring party possessing the [[Azure Bonds]].
