'''Fong Moo''' was an infamous cutpurse from the cities of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Athkatla]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Fong Moo's body was discovered along the [[Trade Way]], between Baldur's Gate and [[Beregost]], after stealing an artifact from a [[mage]]. The punishment for the crime came in the form of an angry spell-slinger. The thief's possessions, including the ''[[gloves of pickpocketing]]'', were passed along to Fong's nephew.
