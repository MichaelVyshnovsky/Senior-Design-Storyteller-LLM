[...] Yet I will support this bid for the crown, scheming though it may seem, so long as the rule of law and right be upheld. Galadorna must be ruled by the strongest...and must not become a land of knifings and monthly intrigues or executions.|''Baron Belundrar, in 764 DR''}}",
        "Personality": "He was the most loyal baron of King [[Baerimgrim]], and the most law-abiding of them.",
        "Description": "He had hairy hands, a beard, and was huge. His eyes were green, with bushy brows, and his nose was jutting, but battered.",
        "Relationships": "He was older than the other barons, and belonged to the oldest and largest noble house in Galadorna. The king viewed him as the best of a bad lot.",
        "Possessions": "During the meeting about King Baerimgrim's succession, there were many [[dagger]]s at his belt.",
        "History": "Baron Belundrar provided additional armsmen for King Baerimgrim during the ailing man's moot to determine succession in the {{yearlinkName|764}}. Though he had issues with Baron [[Hothal]]'s dealings with [[Laothkund]], he was willing to support that, if it meant a solid bid for the throne. He was then blindsided by Baron [[Maethor]] backing Baron [[Tholone]]'s bid for the throne, and the rest of the barons coalescing around that one.\n\nA spell then killed Tholone and the king; after Nadrathen tried to make his own bid for the throne, Belundrar attacked him, and was killed by the mage just as quickly."
