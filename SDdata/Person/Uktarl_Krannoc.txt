'''Uktarl Krannoc''' was one of the co-leaders of the [[Undertakers]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Uktarl and his fiance [[Harria Valashtar]] led a group of failed actors who settled in the [[Dungeon Level]] of Undermountain, where they posed as [[vampire]]s and preyed upon gullible adventurers. In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the relationship between Harria and Uktarl was broken and the two started plotting to kill each other and become the only leader of the gang. Harria acquired a [[flesh golem]] and was on the verge of winning the conflict.

==Personality==
Uktarl was a coward, always blaming the others for his failures. He lied and cheated for fun.
