'''Thrax''' was a young [[dark one]] who was a member of the [[Glumguts]] family of [[dark creeper]]s in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Thrax's cousin was [[Blackclaw (dark stalker)|Blackclaw]], the terrifying and merciless leader of the Glumguts, and Thrax was one of only three Glumguts who dared to cross him.

Along with another cousin, [[Vynnia]], and Blackclaw's son, [[Blackcut]], Thrax made merry by playing pranks and engaging in sneaky ventures in Evernight. Their antics mostly focused on visitors to the city, but on occasion they did things that might embarrass and thus bring down the wrath of the Glumguts' employers, [[Netheril]], if they were discovered. This in turn meant that the three youngsters ran the risk of invoking Blackclaw's wrath, although they believed they would be fine because Blackcut was his son.
