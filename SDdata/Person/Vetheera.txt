Saint '''Vetheera''' was a virtuous, holy person of [[Oghma]].

==Description==
The servant of the Lord of Knowledge was honored as a saint. Vetheera wrote a book known as ''[[The Sum of Theology]]'', which became available at [[Candlekeep]].

==History==
Other than their written work, not much was known about Vetheera.

After the [[ogre]] named [[Little One]] donned a [[headband of intellect]], he became a genius, and traveled to Candlekeep. He picked up Saint Vetheera's book, and studied it in the [[Hearth]], gaining the respect and welcome of the resident scholars.
