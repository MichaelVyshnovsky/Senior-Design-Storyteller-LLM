'''Zakee Rafeha''' was a bartender and portly gentleman who managed the [[Zephir]] tavern in [[Amkethran]] in [[Calimshan]] around [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Zakee, whilst running the tavern, would often overhear stories told by the mercenaries of the monk, [[Balthazar]]. He would get scared by the awful tales they had to tell. He did not wish to know why these mercenaries were there, and was content just working in the tavern.

He may have informed [[Gorion's Ward]] that [[Marlowe]] was a stranger to Amkethran and arrived only a few weeks ago, but that he had to remain as his daughter fell ill.
