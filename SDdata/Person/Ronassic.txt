'''Ronassic''' was a [[human]] historian from the famous [[Outer Planes]] city of [[Sigil]].

==History==
At some point Ronassic recorded a legend from the [[sahuagin]] of [[Toril]] about a mighty [[megalodon]] known as [[Iakhovas]], which proclaimed him to be "The One Who Swims With [[Sekolah]]," the [[shark]] [[deity]] that was worshiped by them. Ronassic commited the legend to a book, a copy of which would later be found on Toril in {{YearlinkName|1349}} by the [[malenti]] [[Laaqueel]] while spying on [[sea elves]]. The book lead her down a quest to eventually resurrect Iakhovas.
