        "Activities": "She left in that year to investigate the nearby [[Palace of the Purple Emperor]], which had been returned to Raurin by [[Pandorym]] together with her companions [[Ghanim]] and [[Haleem]]. While the latter two entered to explore, she remained outside, waiting for them to return. After half a day, she noticed the entrance had vanished as if it had never existed; she tried hammers, minor enchantments of opening, and even prayer, to no avail. Two days later, she returned to Al Qahara.\n\nEven though she never entered it, some curse slew her in her sleep on the first night she was back. Her enchanted sword, ''[[Sadrul]]'', was later bequeathed upon a visiting [[Kiril Duskmourn]], who was on the way to the same ruin that had swallowed Feraih's companions."
