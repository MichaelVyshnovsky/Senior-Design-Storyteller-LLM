'''Ruen''' was a trained [[monk]] and [[rogue]] who lived in the [[Mistshore]] section of [[Waterdeep]] harbor. He was a companion of the young [[wizard]] [[Icelin Tearn]] and the butcher [[Sull (the butcher)|Sull]]. He was an expert in weaponless combat and held the distinction of being the only person to "escape" from Waterdeep dungeon.

==History==
As a child, Ruen enjoyed playing in the woods. One day, he waded into a pool and was touched by [[spellplague]] that was lingering in the water. His [[spellscar]] gave him the ability to know the date of a person's death by touching them. This ability upset the residents of his village and he left to study at a monastery.

Ruen became a successful rogue in Waterdeep but was captured by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]] and imprisoned. The Watch made a deal to allow him to escape if he would become an informant in Mistshore. While in Mistshore, Icelin approached Ruen and hired him to protect her from the [[gold elf]] [[Cerest Elenithil]], who was trying to capture  her. Ruen successfully hid Icelin for a while and helped her kill Cerest when he finally caught up to her. He left Waterdeep with Icelin and Sull on a journey to attempt to find a cure for Icelin's spellscar.

==Equipment==
Ruen had a ring that enhanced the effects of magic.

==Description==
Ruen was tall and extremely thin. His spellscared eyes were red. He wore an old floppy hat.
