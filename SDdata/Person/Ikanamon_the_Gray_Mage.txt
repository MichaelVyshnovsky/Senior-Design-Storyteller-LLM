'''Ikanamon the Gray Mage''' was a [[wizard]] of the [[Adventurers of the Black Hawk]] sometime before [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Ikanamon was one of the Black Hawk adventuring company, which [[Alias]] had false memories of being a part of. Ikanamon himself was infamous for being an obnoxious drunk. After one of his unruly drinking binges, his teammates paid him back for his behavior by tattooing a vulgar and obscene image on his backside that involved [[centaur]]s.
