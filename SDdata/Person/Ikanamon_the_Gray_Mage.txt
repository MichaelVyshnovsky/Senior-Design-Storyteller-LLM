Ikanamon the Gray Mage was a wizard of the Adventurers of the Black Hawk sometime before 1357 DR.
Ikanamon was one of the Black Hawk adventuring company, which Alias had false memories of being a part of. Ikanamon himself was infamous for being an obnoxious drunk. After one of his unruly drinking binges, his teammates paid him back for his behavior by tattooing a vulgar and obscene image on his backside that involved centaurs.
