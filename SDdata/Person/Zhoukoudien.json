        "mainbody": "'''Zhoukoudien''', known as the High One, was a ruler of the [[batrachi]] civilization of [[Merrouroboros]] during the [[Days of Thunder]] ({{Yearlink|-35000}} to {{Yearlink|-30000}}).\n\nThe batrachi grew to the height of their power under Zhoukoudien's wise leadership. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by [[Omo]], a [[titan]] thane, around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. The batrachi lord [[Bazim-Gorag]] later called Zhoukoudien a fool who unwisely made war against the Jotunbrud and lost the empire.\n\nThe High One shared the same name as the batrachi realm of [[Zhoukoudien (realm)|Zhoukoudien]]."
