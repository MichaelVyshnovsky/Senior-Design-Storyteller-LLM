'''Raash''' was a sage in [[Zhentil Keep]] in [[1358 DR]]. His area of expertise was in [[zoology]] and ecology and he was considered by most the best expert on [[dragon]]s outside [[Elminster Aumar]]. Raash had two sages who worked under him. His fees were five times higher than normal for his personal counsel and three times higher for his assistant's counsel.

==Personality==
Raash was known for his barbed temper. He only accepted tasks that interested him.
