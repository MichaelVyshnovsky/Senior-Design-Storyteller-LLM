'''Itharr''' was a member of the [[Harpers]] and one of the [[Rangers Three]].

==History==
Itharr was born in [[Athkatla]]. He abandoned the merchant life of his parents in search of adventure. He became the battle-buddy of [[Belkram Hardeth|Belkram]], fighting some members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Daggerford]].

After that battle, the [[Master Harper]] [[Osryk]] proposed that both of them join the Harpers and they agreed. They went to [[Berdusk]] for training but they did not fit well with [[Obslin Minstrelwish]] and decided to go on solitary adventures.

In [[1358 DR]], he was training together with Belkram under [[Storm Silverhand]] in [[Shadowdale]] when [[Elminster Aumar]] and the ranger [[Sharantyr]] entered a mysterious ''[[gate]]''. Worried, Storm asked Itharr and Belkram to follow and lead them. They joined forces with El and Shar first to fight the [[Zhentarim]] in [[High Dale]] and later with the Rangers Three to contest the [[malaugrym]]s' plots during the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Personality==
Itharr was the quiet one of the group, always remaining behind. However, sometimes he could become very hungry.
