At Lenn's recommendation, the [[adventurer]] relit the beacons as a Harper signal and found Xalliana. Old Lenn also suggested the adventurer knock holes in the bandits' boats to sabotage their efforts.\n\nHowever, while he was away drinking at the Broken Crown one time, the bandits stole a chest of Old Lenn's belongings and stashed it within the [[Hidden Cove]] on Raven Cliff Beach. He solicited the help of the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to recover his chest and Rohini's letters, and revealed the location of the Hidden Cove."
