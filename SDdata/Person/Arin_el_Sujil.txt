Sultan Arin yn Kahar el Sujil was the official ruler of Memnon in Calimshan in 1370 DR. In truth, the real power lay with his advisers and the pashas.
Arin el Sujil was arrogant and paranoid with little power. His vizars kept him in power for show.
Technically, Arin controlled the citys fishing, ship building, tavern, and wheelwright trades.
The only reason Arin was a sultan was because of a political deal arranged by his father Kahar el Sujil.
