'''Arun Maerdrym Half-Elven''' was a [[half-elf]] of House [[Maerdrym]] from [[Myth Drannor]]. He was the father of [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and [[Phaerl Hawksong]] by different mothers. He was a member of the [[Harpers in Twilight]] from [[386 DR]].

==Description==
Except for his pointed ears, Arun looked almost a twin to his son Khelben with long black hair and a beard. He was a powerful [[mage]].

==Relationships==
Arun's wife was [[Arielimnda]]. His son was Khelben Arunsun.

Khelben and his father did not have a close relationship. In fact, Arun had only seen Khelben nine times since his seventh birthday, and he rarely had much to say to him.

Arun's first wife Arielimnda was murdered by the [[vampire]] [[Palron Kaeth]]. He married a second time, to an [[Elf|elven]] woman,<ref group="note">In the prologue of the novel [[Blackstaff (novel)|''Blackstaff'']], when Khelben mysteriously arrives to help his father defend his family from the [[phaerimm]], Arun says, "Calarel saw a reunion written in the stars today. What are you doing here, son?" It is possible that Calarel is the name of his new [[Elf|elven]] wife. with whom he started a family. One of his two children with this woman was a daughter named [[Phaerl Hawksong]].

==History==
Arun was born in the {{YearlinkName|330}} to the elven noble house Maerdrym, the first half-elf ever born to a noble family. Despite this, he was allowed to keep his elven family name.

Arun joined the Harpers in Twilight in {{Yearlink|386}}.

Arun married fellow Harper, Arielimnda, who was a [[human]] ranger. In the {{YearlinkName|414}}, the two had a son. Since the boy was considered human, he was not permitted to take the Maerdrym name. Arun further decided to follow an ancient tradition by not giving him a first name either, instead giving him the freedom to choose his own name once he had earned it.

Arun was killed in [[464 DR]], while on a journey west across [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]] with his new elven family. While defending them from an ambush of [[phaerimm]], he was joined by his son Khelben, who had been sent there by a dream from [[Mystra]]. While in combat with the [[phaerimm]], they learned that the ambush was planned by Palron Kaeth, the vampire who had murdered Arielimnda. She somehow planned to use their blood to destroy the [[Sharnwall]]. Arun and his son were low on spells, and inside a protective sphere, they realized that the only way to stop the vampire's plans was to sacrifice themselves. They shared a final moment, in which Arun told his son that he was proud of him and that he wished that he could have learned his name in that lifetime. Arun then struck the ''[[Duskstaff of Sarael]]'' with his former wife's ''[[Lupinaxe]]'', killing them both—and presumably their foe—and transforming the surrounding desert into a crater of glass. Khelben would later be resurrected by [[Mystra]] to become a [[Chosen of Mystra]], and he took the name of his father as his last name.
