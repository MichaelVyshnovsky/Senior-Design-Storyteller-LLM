Kyorl Odran was the matron mother of House Oblodra in the drow city of Menzoberranzan from 961 DR until the houses destruction in 1358 DR.
Kyorl was a small and physically weak drow. She wore simple clothing and was rather unremarkable.
Kyorl always seemed to emit an air of supreme confidence. She was always arrogant and even hostile to others. She was devoted to the pleasures of the mind. She used her powers for petty revenge at times. Despite being a priestess of Lolth, she did not appear at all devout, and even appeared blasphemous at time. Despite that, she remained in Lolths favor until her demise.
As a psionicist Kyorl possessed a wide arrange of psionic powers. In terms of the psionic disciplines she was skilled in clairsentience, metapsionics, psychokinesis, psychoportation, and telepathy.
From these disciplines she knew the psionic sciences detonate, empower, domination, mass domination, mindlink, switch personality, telekinesis, and teleport. In terms of minor psionic powers, she knew the devotions animate objects, astral projection, combat mind, contact, control body, convergence, danger sense, dimensional door, false sensory input, id insinuation, inertial barrier, inflict pain, invincible foes, molecular agitation, psionic blast, psychic drain, psychic messenger, stasis field, and time shift.
As a priestess of Lolth, shew knew the clerical spells augury, cloak of fear, command, emotion control, enthrall, slay living, and spidereyes.
Kyorl had a number of children, the most notable of which was Quavylene Oblodra, the eldest daughter and first priestess of the house. When her daughter conspired to murder her, Kyorl learned about it from her thoughts. She has always abused Quavylene, making her daughter tremble at her mothers presence.
Kyorl also had at least four sons over her lifetime. The elderboy around the Time of Troubles was Hazaufein Oblodra, who was also the house wizard. The secondboy at that time (in fact the fourth son, since one had died while playing khaless and the other had been sacrificed to Lolth.
Kyorls patron around the Time of Troubles was Tsabanor Oblodra. He had latent psionic powers, which she hoped would help produce psionically talented children. Annoyed at how often he spoke, she cut his tongue out and continued to taunt him to the point that he contemplated death by jumping into the Clawrift.
Kyorls greatest enemy was Matron Mother Ghennitiroth Tlabbar, whom she killed.

Kyorl became matron mother of House Oblodra in 961 DR. Her house used its wild talents to ascend to the third house of Menzoberranzan by 1297 DR, obliterating many of the houses that stood in their way. Despite having smaller forces than houses behind them, Kyorls wiliness in politics, as well as her skill in psionics, kept the house secure in its position.C
At some point in Menzoberranzans past, Kyorl attended the ritual sacrifice of House Baenres thirdborn son, Jarlaxle. However, acting on Lolths behalf, she placed a kinetic barrier on Jarlaxle, which absorbed the thrusts at his chest and redirected them to his older brother, Doquaio Baenre, who was killed. The event and involvement of Matron Oblodra was not widely known, but it was passed down through the years among the members of House Oblodra.
In 1357 DR, Kyorl was summoned by Matron Yvonnel Baenre for discussion about an alliance to invade Mithril Hall. Baenre claimed that House Barrison DelArmgo and House Faen Tlabbar had already joined, thus cowing Kyorl into joining the alliance. Baenre later admitted that Barrison DelArmgo hadnt actually joined at that point.
When the Time of Troubles struck, Kyorl privately planned to take revenge against House Baenre for the humiliation and take power while publicly working for peace. However, she delayed her attack until she was sure she had the advantage, and first took vengeance on Faen Tlabbar. The first revenge was effective, as Kyorl slew both the first priestess Finithey Tlabbar and Matron Mother Ghennitiroth Tlabbar. However, this gave the other matron mothers time to organize and summon demons from Errtu. Kyorl barged in on the summoning ceremony and nearly killed Matron Baenre, but was stopped by the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp. Errtus demons came in then, and Kyorl fled to House Oblodra. Matron Baenre then banished Kyorl to the Abyss to be tortured by Errtu for eternity, while destroying nearly all the rest of House Oblodra and sweeping it into the Clawrift.
Some 127 years later, MezBarris Armgo considered bargaining with Errtu to use Kyorl against House Baenres current matron mother, Quenthel Baenre. Kimmuriel reflected that his mother now had to be quite mad from her torment. Around the same time, the priestess Minolin Fey-Branche also contemplated releasing Kyorl from the Abyss in hopes of House Baenre being destroyed. However, she feared Lolths wrath if she did so.
