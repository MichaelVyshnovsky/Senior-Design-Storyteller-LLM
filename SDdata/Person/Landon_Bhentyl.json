He was a former member of the War Wizards and proprietor of Wheloon Tack & Leather.\nLandon was once a member of the War Wizards of Cormyr until he almost died of poisoned wounds. He retired from the War Wizards, and went on to run Wheloon Tack & Leather, selling leather products.\nIt was a point of pride that he always kept everything in stock so a customer was never left needy.\nHe remained a staunch defender of law and order. To guard his store against thieves, Landon kept a set of wands handy in his belt. But instead of drawing his wand of magic missile or paralyzation, he often accidentally produced his wand of wonder. The ensuing chaos earned him the nickname \"Wonderwand\".\nLandon Bhentyl also wore boots of levitation, and avoided dangerous foes by levitating into the air, where he cast spells or used his wands in safety. He experienced in their use and able to maintain his balance with ease.\nBy 1369 DR, he was an elderly man with a white beard and a limp.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryMages\nCategoryShopkeepers\nCategoryMembers of the War Wizards\nCategoryInhabitants of Wheloon Tack & Leather\nCategoryInhabitants of Wheloon\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nmm799j9f44bcjpywlpk7hdkhnxbb1d0"
