        "mainbody": "Clanmaster '''Ilgostrogue Sstar''' was a [[dwarf]] leader and revolutionary who left [[Citadel Adbar]] in order to claim [[Mirabar]] and beyond.",
        "Personality": "Sstar was said to be mad and never settled for anything.",
        "Relationships": "Ilgostrogue had tens of thousands of followers, including his son and successor, [[Beerkanstrouge Sstar|Beerkanstrouge]].",
        "History": {
            "First Expedition": "Ilgostrogue Sstar was originally from [[Citadel Adbar]]. More than a thousand years prior to [[1358 DR]], Sstar led almost a quarter of the Northkingdom's population, 35,000 dwarves, on an expedition to Mirabar in search of riches. However, they faced daily attacks from orcs while crossing the mountains north of [[Sundabar]], and by the time they reached Mirabar, their ranks had been decimated. A large number of dwarves became disenchanted with the terrible conditions on the northern road and chose to settle down in the safety of the city.",
            "Final Expedition": "Ilgostrogue became fixated on his goal to establish a great dwarven empire after his initial expedition. He then led the remaining loyal soldiers of his army towards the end of the [[Spine of the World]], ultimately crossing into [[Icewind Dale]]. Not long later, the leader perished.",
            "Legacy": "Beerkanstrogue, Ilgostrogue's son, continued to honor his father's vision and convinced the remaining dwarves to found [[Ironmaster]] in a rocky dell close to where Ilgostrogue first looked out over the sea."
