        "mainbody": "'''Yaga-Shura''' was a [[fire giant]] [[Bhaalspawn]] and a member of the group known as [[the Five]]. He commanded a powerful army of giants from his [[Yaga-Shura's keep|keep]] within the [[Marching Mountains]].",
        "Possessions": "The powerful giant owned a number of powerful weapons and pieces of armor. Among these were a powerful ''+4 [[runehammer]]'', the ''[[Shield of the Order]]'', along with the ''[[Shuruppak's plate|plate armor]]'' of [[Shuruppak]], [[chosen]] of [[Gilgeam]].",
        "Relationships": "Yaga-Shura was raised by a [[human]] witch called [[Nyalee]]. She helped him achieve invulnerability by means of a ritual that involved setting the fire to his heart. Yaga-Shura did not show much gratitude, taking her magically removed heart with him as a way to prevent her from undoing the magic.\n\nThe defense of his keep was led by a fire giant [[mage]] named [[Berenn]].\n\nQuite fittingly, Yaga-Shura was an associate of [[Imix]], the Prince of Elemental Evil.",
        "History": "Sometime before the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]], Yaga-Shura took control of at least some of the fire giants in the [[Marching Mountains]], recruiting many more to his army. He left some others to guard the temple-enclave that housed his heart.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Yaga-Shura and the Five began to hunt down any Bhaalspawn they found, leaving death and chaos in their wake, thus beginning the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]]. At the same time, the [[Bhaal]]ist priestess [[Amelyssan]] gathered others into the [[Tethyr]]ian city of [[Saradush]] under the guise of offering them protection from the carnage.\n\nThe city's ruler was a paranoid Bhaalspawn named [[Gromnir Il-Khan]], who prevented anyone from entering into or leaving Saradush. Yaga-Shura and his fire giant army besieged the city but were thwarted by a magical barrier created by Gromnir's head [[wizard]].\n\nWhile Yaga-Shura was assaulting Saradush, his fellow Bhaalspawn [[Abdel Adrian]] journeyed into the Marching Mountains and recovered Yaga-Shura's heart, ending the fire giant's state of invulnerability. Yaga-Shura was subsequently slain within his siege camp, after having finally sacked Saradush. He was the second of the Five to have been slain by Abdel Adrian and his companions."
