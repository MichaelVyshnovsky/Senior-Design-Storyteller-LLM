        "mainbody": "Yaga-Shura was a fire giant Bhaalspawn and a member of the group known as the Five. He commanded a powerful army of giants from his keep within the Marching Mountains.\nThe powerful giant owned a number of powerful weapons and pieces of armor. Among these were a powerful +4 runehammer, the Shield of the Order, along with the plate armor of Shuruppak, chosen of Gilgeam.\nYaga-Shura was raised by a human witch called Nyalee. She helped him achieve invulnerability by means of a ritual that involved setting the fire to his heart. Yaga-Shura did not show much gratitude, taking her magically removed heart with him as a way to prevent her from undoing the magic.\nThe defense of his keep was led by a fire giant mage named Berenn.\nQuite fittingly, Yaga-Shura was an associate of Imix, the Prince of Elemental Evil.\nSometime before the Bhaalspawn crisis, Yaga-Shura took control of at least some of the fire giants in the Marching Mountains, recruiting many more to his army. He left some others to guard the temple-enclave that housed his heart.\nIn the , Yaga-Shura and the Five began to hunt down any Bhaalspawn they found, leaving death and chaos in their wake, thus beginning the Bhaalspawn crisis. At the same time, the Bhaalist priestess Amelyssan gathered others into the Tethyrian city of Saradush under the guise of offering them protection from the carnage.\nThe citys ruler was a paranoid Bhaalspawn named Gromnir Il-Khan, who prevented anyone from entering into or leaving Saradush. Yaga-Shura and his fire giant army besieged the city but were thwarted by a magical barrier created by Gromnirs head wizard.\nWhile Yaga-Shura was assaulting Saradush, his fellow Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian journeyed into the Marching Mountains and recovered Yaga-Shuras heart, ending the fire giants state of invulnerability. Yaga-Shura was subsequently slain within his siege camp, after having finally sacked Saradush. He was the second of the Five to have been slain by Abdel Adrian and his companions."
