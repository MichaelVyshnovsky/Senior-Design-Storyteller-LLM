'''Lord Methrammar Aerasumé''' ({{Pronounce|meh|THRAMM|ar|_|AY|rah|soo|MEH|refs=}}) was a [[half-elf]] [[fighter]] and [[wizard]] and the son of Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]], whom he served alongside his brothers, the [[Tall Ones]]. and, by the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the High Lord of Luruar. He was later named the [[High Mage of Silverymoon|High Mage]] of [[Silverymoon]].

==Description==
Methrammar resembled both his mother and his brothers, being a handsome, fine featured man of tall height and silver hair. 

==Personality==
{{quote|I serve best by stating in all truth what’s best for the Legion and our task of defending the Silver Marches—and if all around this table cleaved to the truth and thought hard about what’s best for the Marches, our work would be easier and swifter far!|Methrammar during a meeting of the League of Silver Marches's council.}}
Methrammar was modest and polite, but candid, and these traits led to his being misjudged by strangers. Ironically, these were the same qualities that made the people close to him, such as his soldiers in the Argent Legion, develop an abiding respect for the half-elf. So moving was his leadership that many of those commanded by Methrammar initially joined the Legion due to an individual loyalty to him. His firm morality and integrity meant he rarely went back on his word, and though certain individuals told him these would make him an excellent [[paladin]], the half-elf always refused, favoring no specific [[deity]] or code of honor above his vow to protect Silverymoon. Though fearless, Methrammar did also carry with him some small insecurity that all he had earned was only given to him for being Alustriel's son. He was aware of this fault and attempted to push beyond it, often quelling that part of himself after any especially hard-earned achievements.

==Possessions==
Methrammar had a unique and semi-sentient ''[[oathbow]]'' named ''[[Swiftflight]]'', made for him as a parting gift by [[Tyresia]], which he armed with ''+2 magical [[arrow|arrows]]'' and ''masterwork arrows''. The half-elf also carried a magical ''+3 [[bastard sword]]'' and wore a ''+3 mithral shirt'' alongside a ''+2 [[amulet of natural armor]]''. anklet that allowed him to cast ''[[sending]]'' every few seconds, directed either to anyone else who wore the same items — such as his brothers or, in emergency situations, the [[Harpers]] Lady [[Cylyria Dragonbreast]] of [[Berdusk]] and [[Sharanralee Crownstar]] of [[Everlund]] —  or to his mother. As part of his equipment as one of the Tall Ones, Methrammar was also given a ''[[spellstar]]''.  

==Activities==
In his youth, Methrammar spent a lot of time working under the leadership of his mother, either as an agent of the Tall Ones or, more publicly, as the High Marshal of Luruar. When he was not occupied by either of these, he spent a lot of time in Tyresia's company, as the two shared a mutual pleasure in crafting magical items — this being when he crafted his ''mithral shirt'' and ''bastard sword''.

==Relationships==

Methrammar was the third-born<ref group="note">Though page 55 of "Cities and Civilization" within ''[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]]'' claimed that Methrammar was the eldest of Alustriel Silverhand's sons, Ed Greenwood later corrected this on Twitter. of the twelve brothers known as the Tall Ones, to Alustriel Silverhand, by then the High Mage of Silverymoon, and an unknown elven lord. Through their father, the Tall Ones had a half-brother named Tyresia, with whom Methrammar was very close.

As a talented wizard in his own right, Methrammar was often accompanied by his [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]], [[Beau]]. The half-elf was very fond of his familiar, and so they were rarely apart — but given Methrammar's responsibilities, this also placed Beau into very dangerous circumstances. To circumvent this, his master would often defend him by casting protective spells, such as ''[[magic circle against evil]]'' or ''[[protection from arrows]]'', on top of the ''+2 [[ring of protection]]'' Beau wore.

At some point prior to the [[Spellplague]], Methrammar developed an attraction to [[Myrin Darkdance]],{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|2988}} but by [[1479 DR]], he was married to [[Gaerradh]].

==History==
===Third of the Tall Ones===
Methrammar Aerasumé was born in the {{YearlinkName|1304}}, to Alustriel Silverhand and an unnamed elf lord, his late father having long since been killed by an [[orc]] in combat, as part of his mother's attempts to garner elven support for Silverymoon. In their youth, Methrammar and his eleven brothers, the Tall Ones, faced many high expectations and pressures given Alustriel’s role as the High Mage of Silverymoon. It was during this childhood that Methrammar first displayed his affinity with weapons and his enjoyment of fighter training, as well as promising [[Magic|magical]] talents that enabled him to become a wizard like his mother. 

As a young man, he and his brothers served directly under Alustriel's leadership, riding pegasi across the whole of [[Northwest Faerûn]] as her representative and observational agents. Though it was still only rumor in Silverymoon that they were the sons of the Lady Hope, they were occasionally tasked with more direct responsibilities, such as arresting fugitives or bringing an end to evil plots. Methrammar's dual-focus on martial and arcane trainings eventually caused him to be weaker than some of his brothers in the latter domain, but, conversely, his capabilities as a fighter earned him great importance in the ranks of the Argent Legion. His inborn talents and hard-won skills allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks of Silverymoon's army and be chosen to lead the forces of the Silver Marches. 

===The Shining Guard===
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Methrammar had been given the title of the Shining Guard and was using the [[House Invincible]] with the blessing of its leader, Vigilant Master [[Erssler Thamm]], as a temporary base of operation for the Argent Legion. It served both to recruit for and host Luruar's burgeoning army. Methrammar had high hopes for the Legion, as he expected to lead a capable army of thousands of half-elves, [[dwarves]], and [[humans]] — or even more if his mother assented to hiring [[adventurers]] and [[mercenaries]] —  by [[1371 DR]]'s [[Midsummer]] holiday.

Two years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Shining Guard and his Argent Legion had relocated outside of Silverymoon to their new headquarters within [[Rauvinwatch Keep]]. From there, he commanded the Legion's forces, guiding their patrols and carefully dispersing them across Luruar as he saw fit — making even his weakest soldiers into true warriors. Those troops that remained within Rauvinwatch Keep (around 400 at the time) spent most of their time training, even if little conflict occured nearby. 

It was sometime in the same year that Methrammar had to part ways with his paternal half-brother, the elf wizard Tyresia, as the latter decided to return to his elven family. The loss made the half-elf long for a companion of similar spirit, one who could share in his earnest desire to protect the people of Silverymoon.

On [[Ches 16]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Methrammar left Rauvinwatch Keep, alongside Alustriel, to meet the elf Gaerradh in [[Everlund]]'s [[Moongleam Tower]]. 

===Post-Spellplague===
At some point after the Spellplague and Alustriel's presumed death, Methrammar took on the role of High Lord of Luruar and returned to rule the Silver Marches from Silverymoon's [[High Palace]]. 

As of 1479 DR, Methrammar's position as High Lord of the Silver Marches was tenuous. Given his age, the League began discussing who to elect next, if anyone, and though Gaerradh, by then his wife, was considered a possible successor, it was thought by some that this would tie the Silver Marches' leadership too closely to one bloodline, making the position hereditary rather than meritocratic.   

By the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, [[Taern Hornblade]] passed onto Methrammar the rulership of Silverymoon as its High Mage.
