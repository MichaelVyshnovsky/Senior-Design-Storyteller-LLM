        "mainbody": "Taerom \"Thunderhammer\" Fuiruim is a renowned master armorer and weaponsmith, as well as the owner of Thunderhammer Smithy in Beregost during the midâˆ’14 century DR. He was very well-respected in his town and considered one of the finest smiths in the entirety of the Sword Coast.\nTaerom was massive in stature, standing over  tall and measuring nearly  wide at the shoulders. He had brown hair, streaked with gray that extended down into big muttonchop sideburns. He was something of a gentle giant, expressing himself with soft words in contrast to his imposing presence.\nTaerom Fuiruim had extensive knowledge of the use of rare and exotic ores in metal-crafting, along with other materials. He was even capable of crafting a suit of plate mail out of the chitinous shell of ankhegs.\nIn battle, he wielded a massive iron staff, with which he could reportedly slay an orc one deft strike.\nThe master blacksmith employed over a dozen apprentices at his smithy, including Surrey, who left his position to seek better work during the iron crisis.\nHe often worked in concert with the enchanter Thalantyr, forging items that were well-suited for magical enchantment by the eccentric mage."
