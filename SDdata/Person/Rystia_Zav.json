She believed that all beings she met were killers sent after her.\nIn the late 1480s, she was tasked with the mission of finding Mantol-Derith and infiltrating the Zhentarim garrison there. However, Rystia became lost in the Underdark. Circa 1486 DR, she came to the gates of Mantol-Derith without knowing she had arrived or how."
