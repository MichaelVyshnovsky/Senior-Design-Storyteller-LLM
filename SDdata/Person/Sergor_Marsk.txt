'''Sergor Marsk''' was a warmage from [[Damara]], and an infiltrator from the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He led the ritual to capture the soul of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]].{{cite book/The Rite||Prologue}}

==Description==
Sergor habitually had a dyspeptic look, a squint, tense shoulders, and a tightly set jaw.

==Abilities==
He led the ritual to capture Gareth's soul. After he was discovered, he only managed to cast one ''[[fireball]]''.

==Possessions==
Sergor possessed, at the time of his death, black thread and a miniature doll representing king Dragonsbane. Presumably it was a focus for the ritual he employed.

==History==
On [[Kythorn 10]], [[Celedon Kierney]] had given Sergor and his co-conspirers a place close to the king because of their unusual success at gathering intelligence from the [[Bandit Army]] of [[Vaasa]].{{cite book/The Rite||8}}

Sergor Marsk was part of the forces led by king Gareth Dragonsbane in [[Mirtul 3]] of {{yearlink|1373}} to fight off a dragonflight roused by the [[Rage of Dragons]]. He used the cover of battle to lead a rite which trapped the king's soul; only the timely intervention by a young soldier, [[Igan]], prevented his treachery from being completely hidden. Igan slew Sergor immediately.
