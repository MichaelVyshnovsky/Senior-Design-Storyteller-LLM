Gorx was a xorn at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.
In 1491 DR, while in his home plane, Gorx saw a gate to Toril. Intrigued, he passed through and arrived in the Fane. There, Keltar, a member of the Cult of the Black Earth, mistook Gorx for an emissary of the elemental lord Ogrémoch. Taking advantage of this, the xorn enslaved the cultist, saying that Ogrémoch needed tributes to be given to Gorx. However, some adventurers infiltrated the Fane and confronted him.
