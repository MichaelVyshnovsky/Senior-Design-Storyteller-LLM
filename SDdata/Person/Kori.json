She had a special relationship with all animals but disliked malcontent patrons, whom she always pitched out of the door.\nKori was an adventurer during her youth.\nOn Uktar 10, 1370 DR, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered her husbands taproom, seeking the Sondarr Scepter. When Bramas Thorntree accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Kori was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers."
