        "Description": "Kori had black hair and walked with a limp.",
        "Activities": "Kori was the wife of [[Jorid]] and helped him run the [[Blue Badger Inn]], a tavern situated in Toralth, a village in northeastern Tethyr. She had a special relationship with all animals but disliked malcontent patrons, whom she always pitched out of the door.",
        "History": "Kori was an adventurer during her youth.\n\nOn [[Uktar 10]], 1370 DR, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered her husband's taproom, seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]''. When [[Bramas Thorntree]] accused some of the other patrons of stealing it, this triggered a tavern brawl. Kori was one of the ones who tried to separate and calm the brawlers."
