'''Phags-pa''' was a [[hare hengeyokai]] [[monk]] living in the forested [[Valley of Lo Chi]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/8/The Flowers of Flame|56}}

==History==
Phags-pa was born to [[Notia T'ong]], who acted as the guardian of his tribe against the cruel [[shukenja]] [[Ko Hung Cho]] and his monks from [[Lo Chi monastery]], who over the years attempted to hunt the hare hengeyokai down and force them into working their mines. At some point, Notia T'ong he sent Phags-pa to go learn the ways of the Lo Chi monastery, as he knew almost nothing about them himself. Taking the form of a [[human]], he did so, but was eventually cast out by them.

Later, around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Shou Lung]] stumbled upon Phags-pa in a snowdrift while wandering the [[Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains]] in search of the fabled [[Flowers of Flame]]. When they found him Phags-pa's hands and feet were bloody stumps, his body having become [[Frostbite (condition)|frostbitten]] and lost a great deal of blood. Still clinging to life, Phags-pa told the adventurers his name, the tragic tale of his people, and warned them to beware of Ko Hung Cho and the [[fire spirit]]. His last words to them were to go find his people through a gate to the west. Following this, Phags-pa transformed into a [[hare]] and breathed his last breath.
