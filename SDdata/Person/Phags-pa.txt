Phags-pa was a hare hengeyokai monk living in the forested Valley of Lo Chi in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Phags-pa was born to Notia Tong, who acted as the guardian of his tribe against the cruel shukenja Ko Hung Cho and his monks from Lo Chi monastery, who over the years attempted to hunt the hare hengeyokai down and force them into working their mines. At some point, Notia Tong he sent Phags-pa to go learn the ways of the Lo Chi monastery, as he knew almost nothing about them himself. Taking the form of a human, he did so, but was eventually cast out by them.
Later, around , a group of adventurers from Shou Lung stumbled upon Phags-pa in a snowdrift while wandering the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains in search of the fabled Flowers of Flame. When they found him Phags-pas hands and feet were bloody stumps, his body having become frostbitten and lost a great deal of blood. Still clinging to life, Phags-pa told the adventurers his name, the tragic tale of his people, and warned them to beware of Ko Hung Cho and the fire spirit. His last words to them were to go find his people through a gate to the west. Following this, Phags-pa transformed into a hare and breathed his last breath.
