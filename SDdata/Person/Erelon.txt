'''Erelon''' was a [[Tethyrian]] captain who trained archers in [[Amkethran]] in [[Tethyr]] around [[1368 DR]].

==Description==
Erelon was a rude and serious captain, who summoned creatures such as [[umber hulk]]s and [[minotaurs]], so that his contingent of archers could train their aim.

==Possessions==
He fought with an enchanted [[Greatsword|two-handed sword]] and a highly enchanted [[darkfire bow]]. He donned a golden horned [[helmet]] that was typically worn by [[Balthazar]]'s mercenaries. His contingent wore red and gold [[chainmail]] with the same sort of helmet.
