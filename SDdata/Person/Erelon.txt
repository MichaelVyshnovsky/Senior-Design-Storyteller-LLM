Erelon was a Tethyrian captain who trained archers in Amkethran in Tethyr around 1368 DR.
Erelon was a rude and serious captain, who summoned creatures such as umber hulks and minotaurs, so that his contingent of archers could train their aim.
He fought with an enchanted two-handed sword and a highly enchanted darkfire bow. He donned a golden horned helmet that was typically worn by Balthazars mercenaries. His contingent wore red and gold chainmail with the same sort of helmet.
