Hykros Allumen was the high priest of the Hall of Justice of Tyr in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
Hykros was a devoted follower of Tyr and a bastion of law in Waterdeep. He was also a student of the early forms of the church of Tyr, believing that over time Tyrs original message had been diluted. Hykros particularly rejected the notion that Tyr was the latest incarnation of Anachtyr, a common belief in south Faer√ªn. He was so against this notion that he was prejudiced again non-Northern followers of Tyr. Hykros also believed in a rigid separation between the Tyrran cleric, monk, and paladin paths.
