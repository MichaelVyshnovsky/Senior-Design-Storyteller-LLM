'''Bhaerusk Montalar''' was the proprietor of [[Montalar's Happy House‎‎]] eatery in [[Suzail]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Bhaerusk was married and had four daughters. His entire family worked in Montalar's Happy House, along with the wife's two sisters. They operated the busy eatery and lived on the floor above the dining hall. Bhaerusk rented out apartments on the third floor and the cellar. Some said that he rented the place out to anyone with some dubious background, no questions asked.
