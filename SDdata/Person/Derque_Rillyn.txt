'''Derque Rillyn''' was a member of the noble [[patriar]] [[Rillyn]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], daughter of [[Hir Rillyn]], and cousin of [[Clerebold]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
It was a popular belief that Derque Rillyn had a foul temper.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Clerebold had an idea he passed along to his cousin, Derque Rillyn, to his usual praise. Clerebold suggested that [[Nortale's Hostel]], a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the [[Absolute crisis]], should be renamed after Derque's daddy – Hir Rillyn's Hostel, in order to convince him to donate a "good old chunk of change" in aid of the establishment and possibly even a bit of extra [[coin]] for Derque himself. This ingenious idea was born from Derque's annual donations to Hostel Mother [[Pammella Nortale]]'s establishment, who, due to strife, pleaded with the noble for a larger sum. However, Derque overstepped his allowance. He could not secure additional funds from her daddy and was unable to get extra dowry coin from the soon-to-be bride – [[Henrietta Hhune]], daughter of [[Hurlbut Hhune]].
