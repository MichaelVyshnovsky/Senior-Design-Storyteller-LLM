Derque Rillyn was a member of the noble patriar Rillyn family of Baldurs Gate, daughter of Hir Rillyn, and cousin of Clerebold in the late 15 century DR.
It was a popular belief that Derque Rillyn had a foul temper.
In the , Clerebold had an idea he passed along to his cousin, Derque Rillyn, to his usual praise. Clerebold suggested that Nortales Hostel, a non-profit hostel used to help refugees during the Absolute crisis, should be renamed after Derques daddy – Hir Rillyns Hostel, in order to convince him to donate a "good old chunk of change" in aid of the establishment and possibly even a bit of extra coin for Derque himself. This ingenious idea was born from Derques annual donations to Hostel Mother Pammella Nortales establishment, who, due to strife, pleaded with the noble for a larger sum. However, Derque overstepped his allowance. He could not secure additional funds from her daddy and was unable to get extra dowry coin from the soon-to-be bride – Henrietta Hhune, daughter of Hurlbut Hhune.
