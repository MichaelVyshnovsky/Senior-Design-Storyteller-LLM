Kraddokk was a storm giant who traveled the Greypeak Mountains in the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.
Kraddokk had a loud, deep voice.
Kraddokks personality seemed warm, but he was troubled by conflicts involving giants and dragons. He cared about smaller creatures. 
Kraddokk saw the Cult of the Dragons failed attempt to summon Tiamat as a marker of the end of the age of dragons and the subsequent breaking of the ordning as the start of the age of giants.
He venerated the giant deity Annam All-Father.
Kraddokk carried six potions of healing.
Sometime after the , Kraddokk heard that a shrine to Annam at the peak of the tallest of the Greypeak Mountains had been desecrated. He traveled there, and found that it had been discovered by members of the Cult of the Dragon, who had been killed by the ice mephits that lived inside. He arrived after adventurers following the notes of the murdered treasure-hunter Veradda Stoor had discovered the shrine, and spoke to them about Annam and the Ordning. He judged the adventurers on whether they took treasure from the shrine or not, but did not intervene.
