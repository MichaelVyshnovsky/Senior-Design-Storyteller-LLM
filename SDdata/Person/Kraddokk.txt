==Description==
Kraddokk had a loud, deep voice.

==Personality==
Kraddokk's personality seemed warm, but he was troubled by conflicts involving [[giant]]s and [[dragon]]s. He cared about smaller creatures. 
Kraddokk saw the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s failed attempt to summon [[Tiamat]] as a marker of the end of the 'age of dragons' and the subsequent breaking of the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] as the start of the 'age of giants'.

He venerated the giant deity [[Annam All-Father]].

==Possessions==
Kraddokk carried six ''[[potions of healing]]''.

==History==
Sometime after the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Kraddokk heard that a shrine to Annam at the peak of the tallest of the Greypeak Mountains had been desecrated. He traveled there, and found that it had been discovered by members of the Cult of the Dragon, who had been killed by the [[ice mephit]]s that lived inside. He arrived after [[adventurer]]s following the notes of the murdered treasure-hunter [[Veradda Stoor]] had discovered the shrine, and spoke to them about Annam and the Ordning. He judged the adventurers on whether they took treasure from the shrine or not, but did not intervene.
