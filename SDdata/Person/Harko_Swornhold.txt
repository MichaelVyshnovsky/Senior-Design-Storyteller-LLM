'''Harko Swornhold''' was an [[evil]] [[adventurer]] and [[bandit]] active on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Harko was exiled from [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1489}},{{Waterdeep-time}} for attempting to bribe a magistrate. Three years later, he returned to the city illegally, where he began recruiting [[kenku]] thugs in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] and using them to incite violence. He soon came to the attention of the [[Lords' Alliance]], who suspected that he was on the payroll of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. Thus, the Alliance's [[Jalester Silvermane]] planned to send an agent to quietly eliminate him.
