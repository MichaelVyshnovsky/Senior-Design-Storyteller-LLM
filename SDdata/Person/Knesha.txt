'''Knesha''' was a bard in [[Mulhorand]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Knesha was the greatest non-divine expert in lost relics and [[artifact]]s in south Mulhorand. She spent all her free time studying about places where ancient [[magic item]]s disappeared.

==History==
Once Knesha was a scribe in [[Skuld]] until a mistake in her calculations caused a loss of taxes. She was imprisoned but managed to escape and settled in Outer [[Sultim]], where nobody respected Skuld's laws. There she found her true vocation as a bard specializing in satirical poems.

==Personality==
Knesha had grown bored of her work as a bard and dreamed of going on adventures.
