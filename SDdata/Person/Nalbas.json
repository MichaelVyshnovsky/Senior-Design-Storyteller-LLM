        "mainbody": "'''Nalbas''' was a [[halfling]] who dealt in exotic treasures, often found in the [[Yawning Portal]] trading with adventurers descending into or leaving [[Undermountain]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Nalbas was a friendly halfling who thought adventuring and especially expeditions to Undermountain to be a dangerous and foolish endeavor. However, it never stooped him from using those adventurers to retrieve precious curiosities for him from the perilous depths of Undermountain.\n\nSpending a lot of time in the Yawning Portal, Nalbas chatted to all sorts of folks and always knew the latest rumors.",
        "Possessions": "In the Yawning Portal, Nalbas sold an odd version of ''[[potion of healing]]'' to willing adventurers. He claimed that it was as potent as any other potion of the sort but it was bitter-tasting.",
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], Nalbas met the lone adventurer who was sent to Undermountain by [[Khelben Arunsun]] to investigate the increased [[kobold]] attacks in [[Waterdeep]]. The halfling shared the rumors of shadow fiends snatching people from Waterdeep's alleys and dragging them into Undermountain, eating the victims' shadows and transforming them into mindless [[zombie]]s.\n\nNalbas won 50 [[gp]] when the [[Khelbenite]] emerged from the Undermountain alive and well and gained access to the second level of the mega-dungeon. The betting for and against brave and stupid adventurers diving into the depths of danger was one of the halfling's favorite ways of making money."
