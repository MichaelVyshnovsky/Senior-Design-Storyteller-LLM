'''King Javilarhh Snowsword II''' was a king of [[Delimbiyran]] in the early 7{{th}} century [[DR]], who ruled during the collapse of [[Phalorm]].

==Relationships==
Javilarhh's ancestor was King [[Javilarhh Snowsword I]], and his descendent was King [[Javilarhh Snowsword III]].

==History==
Javilarhh ruled as the king of Delimbiyran and as one of the three kings of Phalorm in the later years of the realm.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}} In the {{YearlinkName|615}}, the Realm of Three Crowns collapsed, and the [[616 DR|next year]] Javilarhh reformed Delimbiyran into the Kingdom of Man to succeed it. Under his leadership, Delimbiyran took control of the land that the [[elves]] and [[dwarves]] of [[Ardeep]] and [[Dardath]] had abandoned, and offered protective rulership for the [[halfling]]s and [[gnome]]s of [[Secomber]] and [[Dolblunde]]. Well aware of the threat that [[orc]] raids posed, Javilarhh built a great many castles along the eastern border of the [[High Moor]] to guard against invasion and initiated the [[Endless Battle]], an aggressive series of military campaigns that had the armies of Delimbiyran strike at the orc populations of the [[Sword Mountains]] and southern High Moor.
