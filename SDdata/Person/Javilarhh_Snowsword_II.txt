King Javilarhh Snowsword II was a king of Delimbiyran in the early 7 century DR, who ruled during the collapse of Phalorm.
Javilarhhs ancestor was King Javilarhh Snowsword I, and his descendent was King Javilarhh Snowsword III.
Javilarhh ruled as the king of Delimbiyran and as one of the three kings of Phalorm in the later years of the realm. In the , the Realm of Three Crowns collapsed, and the next year Javilarhh reformed Delimbiyran into the Kingdom of Man to succeed it. Under his leadership, Delimbiyran took control of the land that the elves and dwarves of Ardeep and Dardath had abandoned, and offered protective rulership for the halflings and gnomes of Secomber and Dolblunde. Well aware of the threat that orc raids posed, Javilarhh built a great many castles along the eastern border of the High Moor to guard against invasion and initiated the Endless Battle, an aggressive series of military campaigns that had the armies of Delimbiyran strike at the orc populations of the Sword Mountains and southern High Moor.
