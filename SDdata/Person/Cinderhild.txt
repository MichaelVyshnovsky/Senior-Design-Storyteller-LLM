Cinderhild was a fire giant and the belligerent daughter of Duke Zalto in Ironslag sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Cinderhild lived in her and her brothers room with two hobgoblin handmaidens.
Cinderhild was secretly planning to escape from the forge in order to see the world.
Her father told Cinderhild that Toril was full of wonders but gave her no permission to leave and thus she was angry with Zalto. She had a low opinion of her brother.
