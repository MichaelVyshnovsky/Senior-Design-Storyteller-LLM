        "mainbody": "'''Phidalpar Undreir''' was an opportunistic merchant and [[fence]] who owned [[Undreir Facilitations]] in [[Tilverton]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Phidalpar was a fat man.",
        "Personality": "Phadalpar was greedy and unscrupulous, taking any opportunity to enrich himself.",
        "Activities": "Phidalpar's shrewd business dealings made him very wealthy in Tilverton, but he was not associated with the [[Rogues of Tilverton]]. He protected himself and his assets with over a dozen hired guards who were always nearby, armed with [[dagger]]s and [[dart]]s coated with [[sleep poison]]. He often dealt with [[adventurer]]s either by hiring them for an odd job or by serving as a fence for illicit items."
