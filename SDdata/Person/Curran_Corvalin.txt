Curran Corvalin was a halfling in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.
Curran never considered himself a chosen since he had no powers. He only thought he had very good luck.
Curran once lived in Baldurs Gate until he casually found the treasure of a deceased relative, he won a bet, he had some investments come through, and he found a chest of jewels that someone had lost all in the same day. 
This convinced Curran to devote himself to Tymora and relocate to Daggerford.
In town Curran took care of the Fairfortune Hall as priest of Tymora and was in with good relations with the duke and other influential citizens.
In 1485 DR, he met some adventurers recruited to stop a menace to the duchy.
In 1486 DR, Curran was captured by the Red Wizards of Thay, who identified him as a Chosen of Tymora, and transported him to the Doomvault dungeon for experiments. A few weeks later he was freed from his chains by the heroes of Daggerford some of the adventurers he had met and others. Thanks to them, he returned to Daggerford.
