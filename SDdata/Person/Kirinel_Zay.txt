{{Quote
|Listen, and you shall learn! The [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] was last in a place called [[Thorngap]], a spot in the [[King's Forest]] far from any road. We believe that he met with a [[druid]] named [[Halsaime]] there, and was — somehow! — infected with a foul corruption there. Halsaime must be found and stopped.

==Description==
Kirinel had brown skin and long black hair tied into a ponytail. She wore a short dress with leggings, and traveled with a [[walking stick]] and [[backpack]].

==History==
Around the time of the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], Kirinel and other Harpers like [[Tarim Inavule]] arrived in Eveningstar disguised as common travelers to follow the trail of [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]. They lost track of him, but caught wind of the corruption and disease emanating from Thorngap and Halsaime that had already affected the ranger Peron Uthe and others. While fellow Harper [[Jussko Kwahn]] checked the rest of Thorngap, Kirinel sent trusted [[adventurer]]s to investigate [[Thorn Hollow]], aided by the tracker [[Garstrom Toom]].
