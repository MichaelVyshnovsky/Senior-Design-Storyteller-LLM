        "Description": "Being a [[silver elf]], Ellifain had black hair with a bluish tint and very pale skin flecked with blue. Her eyes were shimmering azure with gold sparkles.",
        "Equipment": "Surviving in the wilds of the Moonwood, Ellifain wore a forest green [[cloak]], brown [[leggings]], and a [[tunic]]. She would dress for battle armed with a [[longbow]] and a thin [[sword]].",
        "History": "[[File:Drizzill.png|thumb|''[[Drizzt]] and Ellifain Tuuserail as a child.<ref group=\"note\">The artist's depiction of Ellifain in this illustration is in error, as Ellifain actually had black hair, pale, blue-tinged skin, and azure-colored eyes with gold specks.'']]\nHer mother was killed by a [[drow]] raiding party including [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] when she was a young child. Ellifain survived the raid when Drizzt smeared her with her mother's blood to make it look like she was mortally wounded, so the other drow would leave her alone.\n\nAfterward, Ellifain continued living with the [[elves]] of the Moonwood, but was scarred by the traumatic event, despite the efforts of [[cleric]]s and [[wizard]]s to restore her mental state. When she heard rumors of a drow with lavender eyes who had come to live on the surface, she was consumed with thoughts of revenge. she encountered Drizzt as he was traveling through the Moonwood.\n\nShe decided to kill Drizzt Do'Urden for what she thought he did. The elves tried to persuade her not to, but her thoughts of revenge were too tempting as she hatched a plan to kill Drizzt. The pair were to meet again in the Moonwood, when [[Tarathiel]] and other elves had to hold her back to stop her from attacking.\n\nEllifain eventually found a swordsman who used two [[scimitar]]s to practice against, obtained an ensorcelled ring to aid her, and became a follower of [[Sheila Kree]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Ellifain finally battled Drizzt, but he emerged as the victor, barely escaping with his life. Ellifain died in a pirate cavern thinking Drizzt dead, but [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] arrived with a healing potion as Drizzt lay near death across the room from her, and healed him.\n\nLater, her [[spectre]] was summoned and she realized the truth only in death, that Drizzt was her savior from the merciless blades of the drow."
