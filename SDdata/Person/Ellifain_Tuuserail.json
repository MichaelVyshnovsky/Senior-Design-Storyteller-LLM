Her eyes were shimmering azure with gold sparkles.\nSurviving in the wilds of the Moonwood, Ellifain wore a forest green cloak, brown leggings, and a tunic. She would dress for battle armed with a longbow and a thin sword.\nthumb|Drizzt and Ellifain Tuuserail as a child.The artists depiction of Ellifain in this illustration is in error, as Ellifain actually had black hair, pale, blue-tinged skin, and azure-colored eyes with gold specks.\nHer mother was killed by a drow raiding party including Drizzt DoUrden when she was a young child. Ellifain survived the raid when Drizzt smeared her with her mothers blood to make it look like she was mortally wounded, so the other drow would leave her alone.\nAfterward, Ellifain continued living with the elves of the Moonwood, but was scarred by the traumatic event, despite the efforts of clerics and wizards to restore her mental state. When she heard rumors of a drow with lavender eyes who had come to live on the surface, she was consumed with thoughts of revenge. she encountered Drizzt as he was traveling through the Moonwood.\nShe decided to kill Drizzt DoUrden for what she thought he did.

The pair were to meet again in the Moonwood, when Tarathiel and other elves had to hold her back to stop her from attacking.\nEllifain eventually found a swordsman who used two scimitars to practice against, obtained an ensorcelled ring to aid her, and became a follower of Sheila Kree. In the , Ellifain finally battled Drizzt, but he emerged as the victor, barely escaping with his life. Ellifain died in a pirate cavern thinking Drizzt dead, but Bruenor Battlehammer arrived with a healing potion as Drizzt lay near death across the room from her, and healed him.\nLater, her spectre was summoned and she realized the truth only in death, that Drizzt was her savior from the merciless blades of the drow."
