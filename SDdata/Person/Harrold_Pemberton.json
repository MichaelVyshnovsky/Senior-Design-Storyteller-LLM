        "mainbody": "ord Harrold Pemberton and his wife Lady Mildred Pemberton were a part of the Pembertons of Highcastle noble family in the late 14 century DR.\nLord Harrold Pemberton was an older gentleman with glasses and well-groomed white mustache and beard.\nHarrold had the air of condescension and superiority about him. He often was sarcastic with his wife too, much to her disdain. Lord Pemberton was ashamed of the fact that his family was not from Highcastle and preferred not too talk about the topic.\nIn 1372 DR, Lord and Lady Pemberton could be found within the Chateau Elite, the most expensive and pompous inn in the city, during their visit to Daggerford. \n* It was a common rumor in Daggerford that Quintessa, the perfume merchant, and Harrold Pemberton were secret lovers."
