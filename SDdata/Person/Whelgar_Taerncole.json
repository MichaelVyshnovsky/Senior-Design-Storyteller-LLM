        "mainbody": "'''Whelgar Taerncole''' was a [[human]] man of the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was a former [[adventurer]] and proprietor of the [[Sleeping Cat]] restaurant.\n\nWhelgar was once an adventurer and a member of the [[Easy Blades Adventuring Band]], a group often suspected of smuggling. He later retired.\n\nBefore [[1358 DR]], he bought the [[Sleeping Cat]] [[tavern]] in Wheloon. Sick of the brawling, Whelgar got rid of both taproom and wine cellar, and developed the place as a restaurant instead. By around [[1369 DR]], the Sleeping Cat had steadily become a proper, quality restaurant under Whelgar's ownership.\n\n===References===\n{{refs}}\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Fighters]]\n[[Category:Adventurers]]\n[[Category:Barkeeps]]\n[[Category:Restaurateurs]]\n[[Category:Members of the Easy Blades Adventuring Band]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of the Sleeping Cat]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Wheloon]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Cormyr]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Interior Faerûn]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Faerûn]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of Toril]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants]]\n[[Category:Inhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands]]\n9h8t05kagtkcpcu6h9jwzihjio9u3h1"
