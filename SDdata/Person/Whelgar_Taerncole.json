He later retired.\nBefore 1358 DR, he bought the Sleeping Cat tavern in Wheloon. Sick of the brawling, Whelgar got rid of both taproom and wine cellar, and developed the place as a restaurant instead. By around 1369 DR, the Sleeping Cat had steadily become a proper, quality restaurant under Whelgars ownership.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryAdventurers\nCategoryBarkeeps\nCategoryRestaurateurs\nCategoryMembers of the Easy Blades Adventuring Band\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sleeping Cat\nCategoryInhabitants of Wheloon\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\n9h8t05kagtkcpcu6h9jwzihjio9u3h1"
