        "mainbody": "Elyse was an orphaned homeless girl in Ravens Bluff in the late 1350s DR. She had a gift for prophecy.\nAppearing to be aged 7 or 8, Elyse had blonde hair and wide blue eyes with an alert expression. Although homeless, she managed to find cleaner, better clothes than others in her situation.\nShe was polite and giggly.\nElyse begged for copper pieces and food from passersby, but sometimes related a cryptic prophecy or hidden truth for them.\nElyse didnt know the whereabouts of her parents, but hoped theyd come back for her soon.\nShe had a pet cat named Merrylson.\nWhile local Ravenians knew Elyse well and liked her, they were uncomfortable with her because of her habit of saying things theyd rather keep hidden.\nShe had been an orphan for years. While Ravenian courts and temples tried to place her with a foster family, she kept running away.\nIn the , Elyse may have begged for money from a group of adventures, and told them a prophecy.\nElyse had a natural but rudimentary talent for psionics, being capable of empathy and precognition, as well as the mind thrust attack mode and the mind blank and thought shield defense modes. However, she couldnt control these, and only manifested them instinctively."
