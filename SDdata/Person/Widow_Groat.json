        "mainbody": "idow Groat was a night hag who inhabited the Tomb of the Nine Gods, and was one of the caretakers of the Soulmonger in the late 15 century DR.\nShe had old gold coins covering her eyes, behind which a colony of ants lay. The ants were her spies but also gave away her presence when she was nearing.\nWidow Groat had in her possession a heartstone, a soul bag, and a ring with eight keys.\nWidow Groat decided, along with the Sewn Sisters, to care for the Soulmonger in return for an unlimited supply of souls to harvest. The hag coven included Peggy Deadbells and Baggy Nanna, who were both as horrific in appearance as Widow Groat.\nShe and the Sewn Sisters had a long reputation of fear in the lower planes before joining Acererak, and tending the atropal in the Tomb of the Nine Gods."
