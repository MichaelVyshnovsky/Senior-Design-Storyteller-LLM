He appeared to be middle-aged in 1369 DR, and had white hair and white beard.\nEven though he was an evil person, he cared for the wellbeing of his subjects and often stood up for them to the Cults clerics and wizards who often disregarded non-spellcasters. He was fully committed to the Cult of the Dragons and was ready to slay any of creature opposed to the cause.\nEllis was well-versed in combat. He had honed lightning-fast combat reflexes, was trained in the used of martial and ranged weapons, as well as use of ranged weapons in close combat. He specialized in the use of longswords.\nEllis wielded his enchanted sword, the Winters Eye, that dealt magical cold damage but appeared lit aflame. He owned a winged mask, but usually was not attuned to its magic. A dragonskull amulet and a +1 cloak of resistance hung around his neck. His armor consisted of a set of a full plate and a large shield. He also carried a masterwork shortbow, a healing potion, a potion of endurance, and five cut amethysts.\nEllis generally was one of the higher-ups among the Cult of the Dragon in Myth Drannor. He usually commanded the half-dragon Marjon, and his command ran in parallel to Shamoor who helmed special missions, while Ellis controlled the garrison within the Castle Cormanthor. He was under direct command of Kya Mordrayn, the Wearer of the Purple in command of the operations in the ruined city.\nIn 1369 DR, Ellis was one of the commanding forces of the Cult of the Dragon during Kya Mordrayns plan of conquering the Moonsea region with the help of corrupted mythal and pool of radiance in Myth Drannor. Ellis commanded the garrison stationed inside the Castle Cormanthor while other branches of the Cult conducted abductions to grow their slave forces and undead guardians, as well as excavations within Polyandrium, Dwarven Dungeons, and Elven Catacombs. Ellis was focused on convincing Kya Mordrayn to expand the cramped barracks in the sub-levels of Castle Cormanthor to the South Barracks just outside of the castle walls."
