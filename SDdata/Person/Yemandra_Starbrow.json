        "mainbody": "'''Yemandra Starbrow''' was one of the daughters of the [[Roadwarden]] hero of the [[Roadwarden Guard]] of [[Cormyr]], [[Arelin Starbrow]], active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Yemandra was a beautiful and powerful but brash woman. Her looks earned Yemandra male fans, including a young peasant man from [[Eagle Peak]] who wanted to gain her affection. However, Yemandra Starbrow cared naught about men and preferred slaying monsters. She wielded a [[greatsword]] [[enchanted]] against [[giant]]s, a ''[[javelin of lightning]]'', and armored herself with a set of [[plate mail]].",
        "Relationships": "Yemandra's sister, [[Kallithrea]], thought the fighter woman had a good heart but was too imperious and lacked wisdom and humility to be the next Roadwarden. In turn, Yemandra thought her sister to be weak-willed and [[Dazmilar]] to be honor-less.",
        "History": "In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], at 23 years old, Yemandra Starbrow was known as [[Skull Crag Keep]]'s best warrior, [[paladin]], and monster hunter. After Yemandra's mother perished in a devious monster attack, the warrior daughter was considered for the position of the Roadwarden. The warrior woman thought herself to be the only person capable of leading the Roadwarden Guard. With Arelin Starbrow's death, the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' were lost and scattered by the monster horde. Yemandra was tasked with the recovery of the ''[[Lance]] of the Roadwarden.'' She was aided in the task by a group of caravan guards who'd recently saved [[Sir Dutiocs]]'s life. Yemandra sent her trusted fighting companion, a [[ranger]] named [[Tornilee]], to retrieve the weapon alongside the caravan guards. Yemandra pointed the group towards a nearby cavern occupied by [[hill giant]]s who reportedly got away with the enchanted weapon.\n\nWhen [[Morudel]] of [[Marsember]], Yemandra's father, was kidnapped by the villainous [[vampire]] [[Keremish]] and help hostage in a [[hin]] village across the [[Tunlands]], Yemandra was furious. The [[undead]] demanded the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' in exchange for Morudel's life, yet Yemandra was adamant that the magic set was to remain within the Skull Crag Keep and the Roadwarden Guard need to prepare an assault to avenge Morudel.\n\nDespite fearing the worst, Morudel was rescued, and Keremish was cut down. However, this was not the end of the Keep's vampire troubles. Yemandra's brother, [[Vidruand Starbrow]], long feared dead, reappeared wearing the ''Helm of the Roadwarden''. The group of adventurers arrived at the Skull Crag Keep's Great Hall to witness the family reunion. Vidruand's face was concealed by the helmet as he demanded the rest of the ''Arms'' to slay the adventurers, whom he claimed were responsible for Arelin Starbrow's death and self him imprisoned. Without thinking, Yemandra charged at the group, sword drawn. But she found herself on the ground after Dazmilar tripped her. The rest of the gathered siblings and Sir Dutiocs saw through Vidruand's lies.\n\nWith the bluff's failure, Vidruand removed the ''Helm of the Roadwarden,'' revealing his [[undead]] nature. He was a vampire. The prodigal son unleashed an army of [[giant rat]]s and [[mobat]]s at the gathered family but was defeated after a fierce battle. It was not quite over yet. Two sinister voices turned the heads of all in the Great Hall. Two ancient vampires glided into the castle – [[Khulzond]] and his consort [[Mordroka]], the original masters of Skull Crag Keep. The vampires were the true leaders of the monsters and the cause of the Keep's strife. The undead proclaimed their intentions to take back what was theirs – the Keep and the ''Arms of the Roadwarden''. Khulzond, Mordroka, Vidruand, and summoned monsters and vampires attacked the heroes, Sir Dutiocs, Dazmilar, Kallithrea, and Yemandra. A long battle raged, but the defenders of the Keep emerged victorious.\n\nThe following day, Morudel of Marsember announced that none of his children was worthy of the Roadwarden title. Yemandra and her siblings agreed that one of the caravan guard heroes should become the next leader. It was unknown who of the group or if any one of them took the mantle, but Yemandra decided to travel in search of tougher monsters to slay, with the vampire threat being resolved."
