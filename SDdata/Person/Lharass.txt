'''Lharass''' was a mage of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In late {{yearlink|1357}}, [[Helvon]] and [[Brasker]] discussed Lharass while searching for [[Shandril Shessair]] in a caravan. One of them brought up that Lharass had devised a spell to chain mages with their own magic.
