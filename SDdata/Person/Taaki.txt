'''Taaki''' was [[Sauk]]'s ''arumwon'', or animal companion.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||3}}

==Description==
Taaki had ochre lines painted into her flanks and the top of the head.

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 14]] of {{yearlink|1374}}, Taaki had been attacking livestock around the [[Shalhoond]]. After killing one shepherd and wounding another, [[Berun]] and [[Lewan]] were hired by the locals to stop her. They found lettering scratched into a boot track close to its own, spelling out "KHEIL".{{cite book/Sentinelspire||1}} Berun continued alone, until he came across the tigress menacing a man. Taaki was distracted by [[Perch]],{{cite book/Sentinelspire||10}}

Taaki was slain on the night of [[Tarsakh 25]]. On finally swallowing Perch whole, the lizard slew her from inside.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||34}}
