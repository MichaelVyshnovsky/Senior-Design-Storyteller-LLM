        "mainbody": "Lady Samnilith '''Simonne Whitebrow''' was a [[priest]]ess of [[Gond]] who served the city of [[Zazesspur]] as City Councilor and the entire nation of [[Tethyr]] as [[Samnilith]] of the [[gnome]]s and a member of Queen [[Zaranda Rhindaun]]'s [[Tethyr#Government|Royal Privy Council]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Simonne was a tiny and slim woman, even when compared to other gnomes. She was universally attractive, being found so by gnomes and [[human]]s alike, with dark eyes and black hair parted in the middle. As a priestess of Gond, she wore a deep red robe with a brown sash and a [[silver]] [[circlet]] with a gear affixed to the front. Her belt was loaded with many small objects.",
        "Activities": "Lady Simonne was a woman with many roles. As City Councilor for Zazesspur, she represented her district of [[Zazesspur/High City/The Bindery|the Bindery]], within the [[Zazesspur/High City|High City]]. As priestess of Gond, she hoped to make the world a better place by understanding how it worked and tinkering with it. As both City Councilor and Samnilith, Lady Simonne represented the gnomish citizens of Tether, many of whom lived in her district in Zazesspur, and she sat on the queen's Privy Council in her role as the Samnilith of Tethyr.",
        "Relationships": "Simonne was the daughter of a friend of adventuress Zaranda Star, a [[wiktionary:Curio|curio]] dealer in Zazesspur who went by the name [[White Eyebrow]]. When Zaranda first met Simonne, the future priestess was only a child.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], when Zaranda Star visited Simonne's father to learn more about the political state of Zazesspur at that time, two youth entered the shop to harass the gnomes, and Zaranda protected the two gnomes and threatened the youths with violence if they were to ever return again.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, after Simonne had been elected to her roles as Samnilith and City Councilor of Zazesspur, the Lady Alms Chancellor of Tethyr, [[Pearl Grannox]], offered to distribute funds to help the poor among gnomish populations in the country, but Simmonne rejected the charity. The gnomes were too prideful to except such donations and believed themselves capable of caring for their own without government help."
