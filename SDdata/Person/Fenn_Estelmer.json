        "mainbody": "'''Fenn Estelmer''' was a noble living in [[Waterdeep]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|2-7}}{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|1-4,23}}",
        "Relations": "He was a member of the [[Estelmer]] noble family of Waterdeep.<ref group=\"note\">Fenn Estelmer may be the same person as [[Finn Estelmer]], the heir to the family mentioned in sourcebooks. Otherwise, his relation to the rest of the family is unknown.\n\nHe was one of [[Kyriani Agrivar]]'s beaus in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]].",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of 1358 DR, Kyriani used Fenn to attend a party at [[Castle Waterdeep]] in order to investigate the purported [[avatar]] of the goddess [[Selûne]], who was guest of honor. He introduced Kyriani to [[Open Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]], who spoke of her heroism in stopping the [[skeletal colossus]], but Fenn didn't seem to be believe it, nor that she was a mage. He grew bored when she spoke of divine matters with Piergeiron and [[Khelben Arunsun]], and she disposed of him with a kiss and a ''[[sleep]]'' spell. When he awoke looking for, she strode right past him to confront the [[Shar|false avatar]]. Later, he sighted her riding through the sky with [[Rellamyn]] on the back of an [[asperii]], and was a bit heartbroken.\n\nFenn was with Kyriani on the hottest day of summer, in the [[Selûne's Smile]] tavern as [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] arm-wrestled [[Timoth Eyesbright]] while [[Onyx the Invincible]] collected bets. Fenn asked Kyriani which one to bet on, but she teased that he try his arm on the winner. At that point, [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] escaped from their extra-dimensional prison to wreak a path of destruction in the city, and Kyriani and Onyx pursued and fought them. When all was done, Fenn was impressed with Kyriani's prowess.",
        "Personality": "Fenn was a pompous noble; both Piergeiron and Kyriani believed him a twit, Khelben said he was a useless fop, and Onyx called him a spoiled rich kid. Nevertheless, Kyriani knew him to be good romancer.",
        "Description": "Fenn was a handsome man with long blond hair tied in a ponytail and a gold ring in his left ear. At the party, he wore salmon tights, grey vest, and maroon jacket trimmed in white fur and gold, and maroon ribbon tying back his ponytail. In the summer, he wore a mauve open vest open and hot-pink [[breeches]]."
