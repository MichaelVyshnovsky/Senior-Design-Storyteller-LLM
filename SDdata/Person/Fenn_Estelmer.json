        "mainbody": "Fenn Estelmer was a noble living in Waterdeep in the mid–14 century DR.\nHe was a member of the Estelmer noble family of Waterdeep.Fenn Estelmer may be the same person as Finn Estelmer, the heir to the family mentioned in sourcebooks. Otherwise, his relation to the rest of the family is unknown.\nHe was one of Kyriani Agrivars beaus in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Kyriani used Fenn to attend a party at Castle Waterdeep in order to investigate the purported avatar of the goddess Selûne, who was guest of honor. He introduced Kyriani to Open Lord Piergeiron, who spoke of her heroism in stopping the skeletal colossus, but Fenn didnt seem to be believe it, nor that she was a mage. He grew bored when she spoke of divine matters with Piergeiron and Khelben Arunsun, and she disposed of him with a kiss and a sleep spell. When he awoke looking for, she strode right past him to confront the false avatar. Later, he sighted her riding through the sky with Rellamyn on the back of an asperii, and was a bit heartbroken.\nFenn was with Kyriani on the hottest day of summer, in the Selûnes Smile tavern as Vajra Valmeyjar arm-wrestled Timoth Eyesbright while Onyx the Invincible collected bets. Fenn asked Kyriani which one to bet on, but she teased that he try his arm on the winner. At that point, Aviss and Fellandar escaped from their extra-dimensional prison to wreak a path of destruction in the city, and Kyriani and Onyx pursued and fought them. When all was done, Fenn was impressed with Kyrianis prowess.\nFenn was a pompous noble both Piergeiron and Kyriani believed him a twit, Khelben said he was a useless fop, and Onyx called him a spoiled rich kid. Nevertheless, Kyriani knew him to be good romancer.\nFenn was a handsome man with long blond hair tied in a ponytail and a gold ring in his left ear. At the party, he wore salmon tights, grey vest, and maroon jacket trimmed in white fur and gold, and maroon ribbon tying back his ponytail. In the summer, he wore a mauve open vest open and hot-pink breeches."
