One day, while Sulene was working the front counter, a group of adventurers stopped at the store for something to snack on and were served by her. But they were all interrupted by the appearance of [[Aethalynmur]], an almost {{SIAdj|8|ft|long=yes|adj=tall}} winged [[solar]] in a [[loincloth]]. Sulene was understandably a bit surprised by this, but asked what she could get him, though he required not a cake but heroes to liberate [[Nimbus City]] in the [[demi-plane]] of [[Arrus]]. So, Sulene served the adventurers and watched them negotiate with Aethalynmur and disappear into the [[planes]] while eating a sugar [[cookie]] and planning to tell her friends all about it."
