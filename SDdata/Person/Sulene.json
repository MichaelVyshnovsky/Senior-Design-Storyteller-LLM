        "mainbody": "ulene was a young woman who worked at the Downunda Patisserie in Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nShe had blue eyes that went well with the blue ruffled apron she wore.\nShe was a charming and cheery girl.\nIn Kythorn of the , the Downunder Patisserie had its Sixth Anniversary Celebration, with many new treats and drinks on sale. One day, while Sulene was working the front counter, a group of adventurers stopped at the store for something to snack on and were served by her. But they were all interrupted by the appearance of Aethalynmur, an almost  winged solar in a loincloth. Sulene was understandably a bit surprised by this, but asked what she could get him, though he required not a cake but heroes to liberate Nimbus City in the demi-plane of Arrus. So, Sulene served the adventurers and watched them negotiate with Aethalynmur and disappear into the planes while eating a sugar cookie and planning to tell her friends all about it."
