He preferred [[Fzoul Chembryl]] as leader of the [[Zhentarim]] over [[Manshoon]].\n\nIn later years he supported Fzoul in his schemes contributing to the downfall of Manshoon.\n\nSometime before [[1374 DR]], Manxam was sponsored by the Zhentarim to hunt down and assassinate [[Avagard]] the Black, a minor Zhentil Keep nobleman turned pirate king of the Moonsea. Manxam led a squad of beholders to the pirate's ship where they left nothing behind but ash.\n\nAs of [[1489 DR]], Manxam appeared to be among the senior leadership of [[Darkhold]], then-headquarters of the Zhentarim."
