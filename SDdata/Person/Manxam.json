He was willing to work with humans, so long as doing so was advantageous, and was known to be particularly friendly towards priests of Bane.\nManxam was known to possess a helm of telepathy that had been altered so as to allow it to fit on his body.\nManxam was barely involved in the hunt for Shandril Shessair when she attacked Zhentil Keep. He preferred Fzoul Chembryl as leader of the Zhentarim over Manshoon.\nIn later years he supported Fzoul in his schemes contributing to the downfall of Manshoon.\nSometime before 1374 DR, Manxam was sponsored by the Zhentarim to hunt down and assassinate Avagard the Black, a minor Zhentil Keep nobleman turned pirate king of the Moonsea. Manxam led a squad of beholders to the pirates ship where they left nothing behind but ash.\nAs of 1489 DR, Manxam appeared to be among the senior leadership of Darkhold, then-headquarters of the Zhentarim."
