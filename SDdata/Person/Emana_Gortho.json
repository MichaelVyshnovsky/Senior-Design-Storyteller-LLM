        "mainbody": "Emana Gortho was a cleric of Cyric in Hills Edge in 1359 DR.\nEmana managed the Fist of the Future, a temple of Cyric. Secretly, she was gathering an army to conquer the city. Emana was experimenting with wild magic and sought any adventurers whod escaped alive from the nearby Netherese ruins in the hopes of learning new spells.\nEmana was a careful plotter. She had recruited street thugs and fanatic zealots of Cyric for her army but was always careful to not alert the local Harpers and worshipers of Lliira. She dreamed of attracting the attention of her god and maybe even become his consort."
