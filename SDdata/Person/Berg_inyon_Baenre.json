        "mainbody": "erginyon Baenre was a drow weapon master of House Baenre of Menzoberranzan in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was the youngest son to matron mother Yvonnel Baenre and had many elder sisters and brothers.\nHandsome even by drow standards, Berginyon kept his short hair finely cut.\nHe was described as a typical drow with high ambitions and no sense of morality.\nBeing an elite drow soldier, Berginyon was skilled in the use of handling riding lizards, and armed himself with a 10-foot-long (3 meters) death lance and a hand crossbow.\nBerginyon was a classmate and rival of Drizzt DoUrden in Melee-Magthere, where he constantly ranked second to Drizzt and never once beat him, much to his dismay and to his mothers anger. He was initially trained by his brother Dantrag.\nAfter graduating Melee-Magthere, he commanded House Baenres 400 lizard riders.\nLater, in the  when Drizzt returned to the Underdark, Berginyon helped Dantrag in fighting Drizzt. But when Dantrag began to lose, Berginyon betrayed Dantrag and left the fight. Drizzt killed Dantrag, and Berginyon became the new weapon master of his house.\nFollowing the drow retreat from their assault on Mithral Hall in the , Berginyon chose to accept Jarlaxles offer to join Bregan Daerthe as a lieutenant of the renegade drow band. He rationalized the instability that would likely plague House Baenre after the disastrous failed conquest of Mithral Hall and the likelihood that Triel would soon give birth to a son she would groom to replace Berginyon as the weapons master, which among the drow would likely mean Berginyons death).\nWhen Crenshinibon began to cloud Jarlaxles judgment, Berginyon joined Rai-guy, and Kimmuriel Oblodra in their attempt to usurp control of Bregan Daerthe in the . In the ensuing conflict, Berginyon faced off against the human assassin Artemis Entreri in single combat with Berginyon desiring to fight the one considered Drizzts equal. However, Entreri proved the better and killed Berginyon during the fight in the lair of the red dragon Hephaestus."
