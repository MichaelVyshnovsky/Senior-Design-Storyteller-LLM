Thava had golden eyes and ocher scales dulled in gold. She was tall and bulky, and because of that she was often confused as a male.
Thava wore a white dwarven plate mail and carried an axe.
She was an old friend of the monk Kwan Shang-Li and the tiefling Iados. In 1479 DR, Kwan Shang-Li recruited her in to aid him to fight the eladrin vampire Caelynna.
