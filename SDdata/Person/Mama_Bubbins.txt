Flymber and Homer Bubbins were born some years before the  in the town of Beregost. At some point, Homer Bubbins set out to pursue a career as a member of the clergy of Ilmater in Baldurs Gate to the delight and pride of Mama Bubbins. However, despite what he said in his letters, Homer did not become the "right-hand temple manager" under Father Lorgan, but joined the criminal organization known as the Guild. Eventually, in 1492 DR, Mama Bubbinss second son, Flymber, followed in his twins footsteps and left home to join the Open Hand Temple. Mama Bubbins happily announced that in her birthday letter to Homer.
