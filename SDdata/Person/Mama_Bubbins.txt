'''Mama Bubbins''' was the mother of [[hin]] twins, [[Flymber Bubbins|Flymber]] and [[Homer Bubbins]], from the town of [[Beregost]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Flymber and Homer Bubbins were born some years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}} in the town of Beregost. At some point, Homer Bubbins set out to pursue a career as a member of the clergy of [[Ilmater]] in Baldur's Gate to the delight and pride of Mama Bubbins. However, despite what he said in his letters, Homer did not become the "right-hand temple manager" under Father [[Lorgan]], but joined the criminal organization known as the [[Guild]]. Eventually, in [[1492 DR]], Mama Bubbins's second son, Flymber, followed in his twin's footsteps and left home to join the Open Hand Temple. Mama Bubbins happily announced that in her birthday letter to Homer.
