        "mainbody": "Harnrim Starangh was a Red Wizard of Thay in the late 14 century DR. He was usually disguised as a mercenary wizard of Westgate.\nHe manipulated the Rightful Conspiracy of treacherous Cormyrean nobles with the secret objective of stealing the new spell that Vangerdahast Aeiulvana was creating.\nIn the end, when the Rightful Conspiracy launched its revolt, Harnrim led a small army of fellow Red Wizards to attack Vangerdahasts secret hideout. However, Harnrims plot was ruined by a dragon host that also wanted Vangerdahasts new spell, but to destroy it because it was harmful to dragons. When the dragons saw the Red Wizards, they decided that they were more dangerous than the Royal Mage and slaughtered them all. Only Harnrim managed to survive the massacre and fled, transforming himself into a ballast stone as a long-term disguise."
