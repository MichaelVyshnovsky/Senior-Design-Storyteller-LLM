        "History": "He manipulated the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] of treacherous [[Cormyr]]ean nobles with the secret objective of stealing the new [[spell]] that [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] was creating.<ref>\n\nIn the end, when the Rightful Conspiracy launched its revolt, Harnrim led a small army of fellow Red Wizards to attack Vangerdahast's secret hideout. However, Harnrim's plot was ruined by a [[dragon]] host that also wanted Vangerdahast's new spell, but to destroy it because it was harmful to dragons.<ref> When the dragons saw the Red Wizards, they decided that they were more dangerous than the Royal Mage and slaughtered them all.<ref> Only Harnrim managed to survive the massacre and fled, transforming himself into a ballast stone as a long-term disguise.<ref>"
