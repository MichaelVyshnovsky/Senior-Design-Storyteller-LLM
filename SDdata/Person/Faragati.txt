'''Faragati''' was an [[half-elven]] adventurer hailing from a big city who ventured to [[Vaasa]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
One day Faragati came across a young and good-looking [[elf|elven]] lass meditating in a secluded brook during his travels across Vaasa. He was instantly mesmerized, and the woman invited him to join. Her name was [[Parley]], and as she meditated, Faragati sat beside her, unable to look away from the serene beauty. When the mediation was over, Faragati and Parley spoke at length about their lives, adventuring, and the wonders the world had to offer. Unfamiliar with the city life, [[druid]] Parley inquired about such an alien locale. She expected Faragati to be negative about his old home, but he claimed the city had its own unique beauty. After the two parted ways, Faragati's words inspired Parley to travel and see the world, becoming an adventurer.
