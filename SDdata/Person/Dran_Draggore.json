Your agony exquisite!|Dran Draggore, to the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]], after transforming into his true form.}}",
        "History": "Hundreds of years before the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Dran had [[drow|dark elves]] build the original Temple [[Darkmoon]]. They, however, ended up destroying themselves and Dran was greatly injured in the cataclysm. It took the [[dragon]] a long time to recover, and he later started rebuilding the temple. During this time, he met [[Xanathar]], an evil [[beholder]] crime lord. They planned to rule [[Waterdeep]] together, but it turned out that he was used by Dran.\n\nBy the time Xanathar was slain, Dran had amassed his legion of [[undead]]. He was ready to unleash his army and kill [[Khelben Arunsun]], but was confronted by the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]]. After a mighty battle, Dran collapsed to the floor. However, he grinned and started to rise, transforming from a [[humanoid]] into a red dragon. Eventually, the dragon was slain by the heroes, and Temple Darkmoon was destroyed."
