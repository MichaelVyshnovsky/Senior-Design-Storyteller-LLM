        "mainbody": "'''Ulena the Fox''' was a [[lillend]] [[proxy]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[power]] known as [[Selûne]] and was that goddess's principal proxy.",
        "Personality": "Ulena was very conscientious when it came to her duty as a guardian of the [[Gates of the Moon]], being suspicious of and questioning all who sought to enter Selûne's divine realm.",
        "Activities": "Out of all planar visitors, Ulena particularly sought to keep out the more violent and glory-seeking inhabitants of [[Ysgard]], on account of the fact that when killed her species and Selûne's [[shards]] were not reborn in the same way that [[petitioner]]s were.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some rumors claimed that Ulena was in particularly vile moods whenever it was a [[Selûne (moon)|new moon]]."
