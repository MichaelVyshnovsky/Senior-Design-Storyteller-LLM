        "mainbody": "Haelphar was a chimera who nested on Harvestshield Mountain with his pride as of the late 15 century DR.\nDuring the battle on Harvestshield Mountain between Mrolgyets Legion and the Lords Alliance, the Legion offered a huge bribe to Haelphar in order to persuade him to leave his nest and assist them in the fight. He departed his nest but, rather than immediately join the fight, circled above for awhile as if trying to decide which side he would support. He ultimately obliged the Legion, and flew down to fight a group of adventurers from Waterdeep. Haelphar was ultimately defeated and humbled, immediately leading to a loss of his status and control among the other chimeras in his pride."
