Jessek, also known as Destruction was an undead beholder who roamed the Lowerdark of the Underdark with his companions, the dread wraith Death and the mummy Disease.Described as a "trio of undead", in a subsection focusing on undead, it is implied that Jessek is undead as well, but his actual type is not given.
Hamezaar, the vampire ruler of the Boneyard, once worked to recruit Death, Disease, and Destruction to his undead armies, but they declined for lack of interest.
Circa 1372 DR, the trio were searching for an annihilator, intending to capture and control it with the aid of Jesseks charm monster eye-ray power. After they had an annihilator, Jessek wanted to hunt down and slay the outcast beholder Tobulux for being an abomination, as well as his illithid companion Ralayn who would oppose them.
