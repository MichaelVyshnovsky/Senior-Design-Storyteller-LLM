        "mainbody": "'''Malaug''', born '''Maulagadorn''', was a [[human]] male warrior turned [[wizard]] who was the ancestor of the [[malaugrym]]s. He was supposedly the first human to set foot in the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|1}}",
        "History": "In the early days of the [[North]], Maulaugadorn was a great warrior who created for himself a kingdom there, worshiping [[Tempus]]. One day, his sister [[Alandalorne]] was caught by a strange illness. Maulaugadorn invoked his god and Tempus explained that his sister was a [[sorcerer]] and her powers were starting to reveal. Thus, Maulaugadorn wanted to learn [[magic]], because in his mind he saw it as a new kind of weapon. At last, [[Mystra]] revealed to him a path to become a mage.\n\nIn time, he became a great wizard and managed to enter the [[Plane of Shadow]], where he gained great mastery over [[shadow magic]] but, at the same time, become an inhuman abomination: a proto-malaugrym.\n\nDuring his exploration of the Plane of the Shadow, he built the [[Castle of Shadows]].\n\nLater, Malaug started wandering the [[planes]], and with his new powers he impersonated many beings. His offspring were the first generation of the malaugrym,{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|3}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|224}}, Malaug was inhabiting an identity called [[Undarl Dragonrider]] While he was whisked away by contingency magics, he nearly revealed his true form to Elminster, but managed to disguise his mishap with the appearance of a [[yuan-ti]]. It was unclear whether he survived the encounter, but regardless he was never seen again."
