'''Horthil''' was a member of the [[Harpers]] hailing from [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|74-75}}

Speaking of [[Starfall Pool]] in the [[Moonwood]], the [[dryad]] [[Olsheirie]] who dwelt nearby, and the mysterious floating shield there, before [[1372 DR]], Horthil said "She ignores the shield, and it ignores her."
