'''Yalek Snurd''' was a spy of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History== 
Yalek infiltrated the new faction of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] led by [[Severin Silrajin]]. In 1489 DR, he was among a Cult contingent sent to establish an alliance with the great dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]] of [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. He reported to his [[Zhent]] masters all that happened and they gave the information to an adventuring party hired to defeat Old Gnawbones.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|9}}

The adventurers ambushed some stolen cargo guarded by some cultists, one of which was Yalek. They probably identified him thanks to his V-shaped scar and spared him. After the skirmish, he would reveal that the cultists were in search of a magic item, the [[Green Dragon's Mask]],{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|12}} which was in possession of the [[hobgoblin]] warlord [[Garbul]].{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|26}}
