        "Personality": "Courageous and headstrong, Nerys was a very devout and proud follower of Kelemvor. Due to her belief in the concept of final death, she had a strong dislike of [[undead]].

Even in that unholy land, Nerys attempted communion with Kelemvor for guidance.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|1-5}} The following day Nerys and her companions made their way to the village of [[Vallaki]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|1-5}} where they met up with the newly-turned [[vampire]] Sangin and the werewolves. A fight broke out, with Nerys suffering a vicious bite from one of the lycanthropes,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|8-16}} but finally ended with the appearance of Count [[Strahd von Zarovich]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|19-20}} The group struck out against the great vampire, but were no match for his unrivaled power.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|2-12}} They were saved by the same relic that transported them to Barovia, which when hit by one of Delina's [[wild surge]]s returned them to [[Faerûn]], albeit hundreds of miles away from Baldur's Gate in the [[Frozenfar|frigid north]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|15-20}}",

After turning away the giants and freeing their captive [[white dragon]] [[Nilanthe]],{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|7-17}} they retained one of the giant raiders as a captive and interrogated him to learn Gryttmort's schemes.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|19-20}} They learned of his plot to recover an ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'' from the dragon's lair in mountain [[Cold Crag]],{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|1-4}} rallied their allies in town,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|5}} and ventured out across the ice and snow.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|6-9}} The heroes allied themselves with Nilanthe and helped fight out the approaching giants, until Gryttmort seized the ''orb'' and turned Nilanthe to his side in the battle and caved in the lair upon the heroes.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|12-20}}\n\nAfter regrouping at Fireshear and praying to Kelemvor,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|4-5}} Nerys joined her companions in sneaking onto a frost giant longboat, into their glacial fortress.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|7-13}} Their infiltration ended abruptly as Minsc inadvertently attracted the attention of all the frost giants.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|18-20}} The heroes fought valiantly against the overwhelming giant warriors.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|1-7}} When the intrepid Shandie managed to nullify the ''orb of dragonkind's'' powers and the hamster Boo grew to even more tremendous proportions, the battle turned in their favor.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|9-14}} When they returned to Fireshear victorious, most of the heroes celebrated with the townsfolk.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|16-19}} Nerys however marked the occasion alone, haunted by the growing realization that she had been inflicted with the werewolf's curse.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|20}}",

Fearful they may have waited too long to remove the curse, Alby prepared a [[ritual]] that would hopefully restore Nerys to her fully-[[human]] state before she was bitten. He coaxed Nerys into transformation, and while her friends restrained her physical form, guided her psyche as it confronted some deep fears that manifested in her curse. In the end Nerys overcame her self-doubt and stayed true to what she held dear, banishing the curse and celebrating the victory with her companions.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|11-20}}\n\nSome time later, Nerys and the group gathered together to help [[Aubree Lucent]], a [[Hellrider]] from [[Elturel]] whom Minsc and Delina had saved from a fiendish [[hell knight]].

Just as Haruman was about to kill Minsc, Nerys plunger her blade through the corrupted knight's chest. In an act of defiant vengeance, Haruman leveled the precipice upon which they were standing,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|10-16}} causing them to fall from Elturel's streets a great distance onto a pile of bones on Avernus' scorched battlegrounds.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|5}}\n\nStanding atop the actual top layer of the Nine Hells, Nerys and Minsc witnessed the true horror that was the eternal [[Blood War]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|6-7}} They ran away from rampaging [[demon]]s, were briefly captured aboard the [[infernal war machine]] of the [[Bloodrovers]], and thrown into the waters of [[River Styx]], nearly stripping them of their memories and humanity.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|8-14}} Just as she overcame the trauma of lycanthropy, Nerys faith in her god and her freinds helped endure the horrific effects of the Styx; Minsc however was not so resilient.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|18-20}} Seeing that Minsc had been stripped of his memories and warrior instinct, Nerys took charge{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|1-4}} until she and Minsc could be reunited with their friends.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|10}} Facing down [[Archdevil]] Zariel herself, the group managed to survive together long enough to see Elturel returned to its rightful place in the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|11-16}}",
