Karie Leddle was a Morninglord of Amaunator that visited the Wheloon Prison in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR during the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon.
Karie was a light-skinned human with long black hair. She wore a set of decorated chain mail, and carried a buckler and mace-like holy symbol of Amaunator.
Karie was disgusted by the conditions of the Wheloon Prison, and refused to let the situation go unanswered.
Karie Leddle visited Wheloon alongside other Morninglords like Adara Semple, Dai Rolno, and Maribe Banro. She could be found at the docks of the Prison, preaching to (or shouting at) the nearby Purple Dragons, War Wizards, magistrates, and dockworkers about the mistreatment and innocence of those held within. She also worked with the Wheloon natives of Harvest Hall, and knew ways to sneak into the city through the drainage culverts with or without the permission of Cormyr.
