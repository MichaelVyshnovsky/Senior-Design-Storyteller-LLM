        "mainbody": "illonah Leadstopper was an agent of the Order of the Gauntlet that lived in Phlan during the late 15 century DR.\nAfter the passing of her mother, Villonah regularly got into trouble with the law, albeit in cases involving minor crimes. She was often saved by her father Rillo Leadstopper, who paid for the damage she caused. In truth, she had joined secretly the Order of the Gauntlet and worked for them.\nOne day in the 1480s DR, Villonah and her fellow Yllivia allowed themselves to be captured by Knights of the Black Fist in order to find a map that showed a secret white dragon lair. However, they were transported to a secret prison where corrupt Black Fists tortured prisoners for sport. Villonah was saved by adventurers hired by her father."
