'''Yornar the Tracker''' was a legendary [[ranger]] of [[the North]] in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. One of the faithful of [[Mielikki]], he was gifted by the Lady of the Forest with the holy [[spellbook]] that came to carry his name—''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.

==Description==
He was said to be a giant of a man, gaunt and bearded.

==Activities==
Yornar roamed the eastern backlands of the [[Sword Coast North]] and as far as the [[Silver Marches]], only rarely setting foot within the cities of [[Everlund]], [[Neverwinter]], and [[Silverymoon]]. Yet he was well known to the foresters, trappers, and prospectors who journeyed these lands. He had a reputation for emerging from a storm or the dark of night, giving aid to travelers in need, and departing without even a goodbye, all with only a smile and few if any words spoken if he could help it.

He devoted much of his time to casting minor [[spell]]s that would provide shelters and food for [[bear]]s and [[snail]]s within the woodlands.

==History==
Yornar once tricked a horde of [[orc]]s into entering a gorge, and then set off rockfalls that filled the gorge with boulders, thereby destroying the whole horde singlehandedly.

According to legend, one dark night, Yornar the Tracker was lost in the forest and harried by [[bugbear]]s when he glanced up at the crescent [[moon]] and muttered "Oh, that the moon itself would come down and light the way for my sword." And to his surprise, it did, with a small glowing crescent descending from the heavens and illuminating the forest. As the bugbears cowered, Yornar could see clearly enough to overcome them. Afterward, he gazed up at the crescent and prayed to Mielikki to give thanks, when it floated down into his hand and was revealed to be a book of spells.

As he could not understand, let alone cast, the spells himself, Yornar prayed ardently to Mielikki for guidance on what to do with it. One night, he was awoken by low, rich voice in his ear, saying "Keep it with you and give it to one who will serve me. You will know when the time is right to bestow it." He even felt a kiss on his cheek, with a touch of fire yet as cool as spring water. However, when Yornar sat up and look into the forest, he found he was alone. The Lady of the Forest had been with him.

Eventually, in the {{YearlinkName|964}}, Yornar the Tracker dutifully gave the book to a Mielikkian priestess named [[Emthreena Gulkryn]], and she too would pass it on in time.

As far as anyone knows, Yornar the Tracker was last seen by a woodcutter in the {{YearlinkName|996}}, while signs of his work were identified as last as {{YearlinkName|999}}. Otherwise, he was never seen again and the resting place of his remains was unknown. As of [[1368 DR]], the [[church of Mielikki]] held that Yornar the Tracker lived still, now as the personal servant of Mielikki herself.

===Legacy===
Mielikki's book would be passed on again and again down through the centuries. As Yornar was the first to carry it, it was named for him thereafter—''Yornar's Trail Companion''.

One other [[magic item]] would be named for him: the very similar ''[[Yornar's crescent]]''.<ref>
