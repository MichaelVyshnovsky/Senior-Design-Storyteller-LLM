        "mainbody": "'''Fyroth Tahsravil''' was an advisor to [[Maurandyr]] who was the High Ward of the fortress town of [[Hluthvar]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Fyroth was a skilled [[warrior]] and [[mage]] who led patrols in the [[Sunset Vale]] surrounding Hluthvar. He earned a reputation as a slayer of [[Zhentarim]] as rare was the occasion where he failed to return to the fortress without defeating [[Zhent]] raiders and patrols.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In truth, Fyroth was a member of the Zhentarim who infiltrated Hluthvar in order to gain access to Maurandyr. He used special [[spell]]s and [[magic item]]s to hide his true idendity from his target. He also used unique spells developed within [[Darkhold]] to slowly drive Maurandyr mad so he could assume control. All of the Zhents slain by Fyroth during his patrols were viewed as a neccessity by his superiors and were usually those who had outlived their usefulness."
