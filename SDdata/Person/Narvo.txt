Narvo was a Red Wizard in the late 14 century DR.
He reported to his superiors on the status of Englar and Sanbreean.
He carried a speaking stone that allowed him to contact his superiors. Unknown to him, it could be made to detonate.
His superior expected him to use a mindlink spell of sorts to contact Englar.
Narvo used as a point of comparison for numbers of War Wizards the attack on the Devil Dragon, strongly implying hed been either present or watching somehow.
Narvo reported on the status of the Red Wizards working with the Rightful Conspiracy after the Marsember meeting in the early spring of the  was raided by the War Wizards of Cormyr. Having reported much of his comrades to be currently facing heavy attack on the docks and expecting many casualties, as well as the deaths of a couple specific individuals, he was slain by the explosion of his speaking stone, which decapitated him on the spot.
