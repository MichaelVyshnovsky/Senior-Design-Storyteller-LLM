'''Narvo''' was a [[Red Wizard]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He reported to his superiors on the status of [[Englar]] and [[Sanbreean]].

==Possessions==
He carried a ''[[speaking stone]]'' that allowed him to contact his superiors. Unknown to him, it could be made to detonate.

==Abilities==
His superior expected him to use a ''mindlink'' [[spell]] of sorts to contact Englar.

==History==
Narvo used as a point of comparison for numbers of War Wizards the attack on the [[Devil Dragon]], strongly implying he'd been either present or watching somehow.

Narvo reported on the status of the [[Red Wizards]] working with the [[Rightful Conspiracy]] after the [[Marsember]] meeting in the early spring of the {{YearlinkName|1373}} was raided by the [[War Wizards]] of [[Cormyr]]. Having reported much of his comrades to be currently facing heavy attack on the docks and expecting many casualties, as well as the deaths of a couple specific individuals, he was slain by the explosion of his ''speaking stone'', which decapitated him on the spot.
