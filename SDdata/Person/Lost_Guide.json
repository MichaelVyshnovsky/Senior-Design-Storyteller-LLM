        "mainbody": "The '''Lost Guide''' was the name given to a wagon driver from the [[Dessarin Valley]] whose true moniker was lost to time. He was famous in the town of [[Triboar]] and the city of [[Yartar]].",
        "History": "Local legend states that either during or before the [[Era of Upheaval]], the Lost Guide was transporting a cart loaded with [[gold]] between Triboar and Yartar. For unknown reasons, he went missing during this trek and each settlement blamed the other for both his death and the lost gold. The two towns maintained an intense rivalry for well over the next century.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed by some the remains of the Lost Guide, along with the missing gold, could be found at the bottom of the [[River Dessarin]]."
