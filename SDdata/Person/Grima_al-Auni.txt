Grima al-Auni min Kor was an ethoist (conservative) priest of Kor and member of the Corsair Council of Hawa.
Grima had black hair and black eyes but appeared stately even though he was a hill giant.
His calm manner blended well with the Council, often providing reason where others sought direct action.
Grima possessed the common abilities of a priest, but used his detect lie spell often while listening to those petitioning him for sanctuary.
Grima enjoyed working with children who sometimes needed protection while growing up in the violent corsair society. He was able to secure funds from the Council to build a mosque dedicated to Kor in Hawa.
Grima was trained in Huzuz and was on his way to Liham, when he was captured by Jayani al-Jasir and taken to the Corsair Domains. Since then he has found his true calling among the rough inhabitants of Hawa.
