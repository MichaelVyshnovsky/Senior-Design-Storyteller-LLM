'''Grima al-Auni min Kor''' was an [[ethoist]] (conservative) [[priest]] of [[Kor]] and member of the [[Corsair Council]] of [[Hawa]].

==Description==
Grima had black hair and black eyes but appeared stately even though he was a [[hill giant]].

==Personality==
His calm manner blended well with the Council, often providing reason where others sought direct action.

==Abilities==
Grima possessed the common abilities of a priest, but used his ''[[detect lie]]'' spell often while listening to those petitioning him for sanctuary.

==Activities==
Grima enjoyed working with children who sometimes needed protection while growing up in the violent [[corsair (kit)|corsair]] society. He was able to secure funds from the Council to build a mosque dedicated to Kor in Hawa.

==History==
Grima was trained in [[Huzuz]] and was on his way to [[Liham]], when he was captured by [[Jayani al-Jasir]] and taken to the [[Corsair Domains]]. Since then he has found his true calling among the rough inhabitants of Hawa.
