        "mainbody": "chthyglug the Voluminous was a marid in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nIn 1492 DR, Ichthyglug was summoned into a pool in the Caverns of Ooze inside Undermountain and he couldnt go back to the Elemental Plane of Water until he obtained the phylactery of the lich Ezzat. However, he was confined to the pool. Afterward, the marid tried to convince all travelers to accept the quest of recovering the item for him, in exchange for a great treasure. If someone gave the phylactery to Ichthyglug, he immediately returned to the Elemental Plane of Water with all the pool but left the promised reward. If someone gave the item to Jaruk the dao instead, the marid learned of this and tried to kill the person.\nWhile waiting to go back home, Ichthyglug used his time to swim around the pool with the quippers and sing. If killed, Ichthyglug re-formed in 24 hours."
