        "mainbody": "Mother Gothal owned a festhall in Amphail.\nShe liked hearing peoples dreams and schemes and often gave wise advice.\nGothal lived and worked with Dlara, a huge woman from the Chultan Peninsula whom Gothal helped rescue from slavery in Waterdeep.\nOnce, Gothal was a famed and beauteous dancer in Baldurs Gate. Through larceny, she was able to retire comfortably in Waterdeep. There, however, she discovered that her neighbours, the Oloskar family, were secretly slavers. She hired adventurers to free the slaves, and was then chased out of the city by the Oloskars, who continued to pursue Gothal and the freed slaves until the Oloskars were completely wiped out. Unfortunately, only Gothal and one of the freed slaves, a Chultan woman named Dlara, survived the pursuit, and Gothal moved to Amphail, where she had to come out of retirement. She opened a successful festhall in the former country house of a necromancer named Dalrosz Kothont."
