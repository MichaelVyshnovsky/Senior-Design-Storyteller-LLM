        "History": "Once, Gothal was a famed and beauteous dancer in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Through larceny, she was able to retire comfortably in Waterdeep. There, however, she discovered that her neighbours, the [[Oloskar]] family, were secretly slavers. She hired [[adventurer]]s to free the slaves, and was then chased out of the city by the Oloskars, who continued to pursue Gothal and the freed slaves until the Oloskars were completely wiped out. Unfortunately, only Gothal and one of the freed slaves, a [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] woman named Dlara, survived the pursuit, and Gothal moved to Amphail, where she had to come out of retirement. She opened a successful festhall in the former country house of a [[necromancer]] named [[Dalrosz Kothont]]."
