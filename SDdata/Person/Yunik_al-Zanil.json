        "mainbody": "'''Yunik al-Zanil''' ran a small shop specializing in flying tours within the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Activities": "Yunik’s rates were pricey, but worth it. For 20 [[dinar]]s customers received a 30 minute aerial tour of Golden Huzuz aboad a ''[[flying carpet]]''. The tours were customized based upon what the customer wished to view.\n\nYunik had several apprentices who paid for their training by taking customers on tours, though Yunik stepped in to conduct tours for elite customers.\n\nFlying above the [[Golden Mosque]] or the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] was prohibited.\n\nCustomers who had the permission of the [[Alyana al-Azzazi|Grand Vizier]] or [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] were allowed to purchase flying carpets from Yunik. Large carpets sold for 10,000 dinar, and smaller ones for 5,000. The waiting time to receive a carpet was six months. If customers were not willing to wait that long, Yunik sometimes sold the carpets he used on tours."
