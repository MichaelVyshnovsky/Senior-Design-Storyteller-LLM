Alleena Moss was a young girl that lived with her family on a farm in the Twilight Marsh of the Moonsea North during the late 15 century DR.
Aleena was the daughter of Millivent and Haldred Moss. She had four brothers and sisters, Bo, Kithian, Quayle, and Volland.
Some time during the 1480s DR, the familys farm was raided by goblins from the Foulwater tribe. Alleena and her siblings along with their father were not able to escape the attack in time and appeared to be captured by the goblin raiders. Only Alleenas mother Millivent, and the infant Bo, managed to get away and seek aid.
