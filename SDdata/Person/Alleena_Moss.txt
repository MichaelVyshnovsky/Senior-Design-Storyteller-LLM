'''Alleena Moss''' was a young girl that lived with her family on a farm in the [[Twilight Marsh]] of the [[Moonsea North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|11}}

==Relationships==
Aleena was the daughter of [[Millivent Moss|Millivent]] and [[Haldred Moss]]. She had four brothers and sisters, Bo, [[Kithian Moss|Kithian]], [[Quayle Moss|Quayle]], and [[Volland Moss|Volland]].

==History==
Some time during the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the family's farm was raided by [[goblin]]s from the [[Foulwater]] tribe. Alleena and her siblings along with their father were not able to escape the attack in time and appeared to be captured by the goblin raiders. Only Alleena's mother Millivent, and the infant Bo, managed to get away and seek aid.
