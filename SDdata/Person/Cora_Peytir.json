        "mainbody": "Cora Peytir was one of the Blades of Mulmaster.\nIn addition to her duties as a Blade, Cora managed her family business of lumberyards and mills.\nAround 1491 DR, a series of strange quakes damaged only House Peytirs holdings, so she hired some adventurers to investigate the matter.\nCora knew that her hold on power was tenuous at best, but she enjoyed her position and the attention she received. Cora easily saw through raw flattery, but could sometimes overlook the agenda of those who were exceedingly deferential to her status as a Blade. She always conducted reasoned negotiations but did not shy away from threats of financial ruin or implied violence."
