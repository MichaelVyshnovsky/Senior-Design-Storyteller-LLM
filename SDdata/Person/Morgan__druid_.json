        "mainbody": "organ was a druid active in the High Moor sometime prior to the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was the namesake of the Morgans redwing species of butterfly.\nDuring his time, a tribe of goblins discovered that the redwing butterflies native to the High Moor could be boiled to produce a desirable crimson dye. They soon taught this to the other goblins of the High Moor, and in turn, the butterflies quickly became endangered. At this point, Morgan moved to save the insects from extinction. Capitalizing on a wasting disease that had befallen some of the goblins, he spread rumors that it was caused by the redwing dye, thus sparking concerns that the dye was poisonous. The lie compelled the goblins to leave the butterflies alone, thus allowing their numbers to recover. As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the species was known as \"Morgans redwings\" in the druids honor."
