'''Thorm Sureblade''' was the older half-brother of Lord Magistrate [[Tordon Sureblade]] and the Guildmaster of the [[Independent Fighters' Guild]], the smallest fighters' guild of [[Ravens Bluff]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
At the age of 66, ''circa'' [[1357 DR]], Thorm Sureblade was {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall and weighed {{SI|200|pounds|k|long=yes}}, and was very muscular for a [[Half-elf|half-elf]]. Rakishly handsome despite (or perhaps because of) the scar that descended from the black silk eye patch over his right eye to his jawline. In town, he preferred to wear dark green or dark blue clothing. When traveling he wore black. His voice was a rumbling baritone. He was always armed with at least a [[dagger]] and never went without his ''[[bracers of defense]]'' and ''[[ring of protection]]''.

==Personality==
Thorm was a friendly bear of a man with a hearty sense of humor. He was a self-confident, natural leader and made quick decisions in the field. A [[Chaotic neutral|chaotic]] fighter, his training techniques emphasized quick thinking and winning by any means necessary, fair or foul. He enjoyed good food and collected finely carved tobacco pipes. When he had a bad day at the guild, he tended to start "friendly" brawls at the rowdiest inns and taverns in town. His brawling tended to exasperate his brother Tordon, who often had to bail him out of jail. He was fairly free with his money, being of the "easy come, easy go" mentality. Thorm was particularly friendly toward [[elves]] and [[halfling]]s and very respectful of [[dwarves]]. He wanted to produce the best fighters in Ravens Bluff, but sometimes found it difficult to focus on the guild, as he loved adventure.

==Abilities==
Thorm carried a [[magic item]] [[Battleaxe|+''3 battleaxe'']], +''1 ring of protection'', ''bracers of defense'', [[Longbow|+''1 longbow'']], and twenty [[Arrow|+''1 arrows'']]. He was proficient in the dagger, [[longsword]], [[Greatsword|two-handed sword]], [[Crossbow|light crossbow]], and longbow. He specialized in the battleaxe.

His physical abilities were above average with strength and dexterity the highest. However, he was barely average in wisdom.

Due to his elf lineage, he could ''resist charm and sleep'', possessed ''[[darkvision]]'' and ''[[Detect secret doors|detected secret doors]]''.

==History==
Thorm was born to a [[moon elf]] lady named [[Elwinda Sureblade|Elwinda]] and a strong [[human]] fighter named [[Wilhelm Sureblade|Wilhelm]] in the {{YearlinkName|1291}}. He grew up in a village with a good mix of humans, elves, dwarves, [[gnome]]s, and halflings and has learned many of their skills and customs.

At age 25, ''circa'' {{YearlinkName|1310}}, he worked as a mercenary guard for a trading caravan bound for the east and sometime during the six-year trip it was rumored that he entered the lands of [[Kara-Tur]], but Thorm never spoke about this period of his life because of his tragic return home. In the {{YearlinkName|1322}}, he found his village [[Dead Tree Hollow]] sacked and burned, the few survivors (including his father) telling a tale of [[minotaur]]s sweeping through the village destroying everything in their path. Thorm rallied the survivors and pursued the minotaurs and defeated them in an ambush but with heavy losses, including his right eye, but again his father survived (as so did his five year old half-brother in secret).{{Cite polyhedron/148/Pillars of Ravens Bluff}}

He wandered after that, building a reputation as an able and trustworthy fighter with many opportunities to prove his skill. He discovered he had a younger half-brother, the Tormtar [[paladin]] Tordon Sureblade, when he met him in a temple of [[Torm]] and learned that his father had remarried a human woman named [[Eleanora Sureblade|Eleanora]]. The half-brothers formed a fast friendship but they parted ways because Tordon was following the way of the paladin and Thorm wanted more freedom. Years passed and Tordon settled in [[Ravens Bluff]] and eventually a letter from him caught up with Thorm, asking if he would consider running one of the fighter's guilds in Ravens Bluff. Thorm impulsively agreed. His younger brother became the Lord Magistrate in the {{YearlinkName|1349}} and later wrote official volumes of law for Ravens Bluff to be widely spread later, known as "Tordon's Law". By Tordon's approaching [[1375 DR|fifty-eighth birthday]], it was unknown how strong Thorm was compared to his younger half-brother.
