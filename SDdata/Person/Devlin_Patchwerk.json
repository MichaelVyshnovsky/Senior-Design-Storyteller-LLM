        "mainbody": "Devlin Patchwerk was a member of the Shadow Thieves and brother of Mishad Patchwerk who resided in the stronghold within Undermountain in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nDevlin Patchwerk was rude but not aggressive like many of his guild-mates. He was not the smartest person in the dungeon and could be easily misled to reveal the illusion hiding the Shadow Thieves stronghold entrance.\nIn 1370 DR, Devlin Patchwerk was stationed in the caves to guard the Shadow Thieves hideout entrance. The guild was thought to be purged from Waterdeep, but in secret, theyd established a base of operations under the City of Splendors in one of the top layers of Undermountain. When the guilds return was discovered by Khelben Arunsun, he knew it was an immediate danger to the Lords of Waterdeep, and he outfitted a lone adventurer to uncover the thieves base, marked with a holy symbol of Mask. The adventurer encountered Devlin Patchwerk standing guard, who was easily misled into revealing the stronghold entrance."
