        "History": "In [[1341 DR]], Keryth was accepted as a new student by the High Mages [[Taranath Reefglamor]] and [[Yrlimn Tidark]], together with [[Talor Vurtalis]] and [[Jhanra Merlistar]]. Taranath placed three ''[[selu'kiira]]'' upon their brows, sending the students into comas while the gems force-fed the knowledge of millennia into their brains.\n\nKeryth and his fellows awoke only on [[Tarsakh 1]] of [[1369 DR]] in order to help in the [[Twelfth Serôs War]].\n\nKeyth and his fellows helped their masters in the war and in the great spell that sent [[Iakhovas]] to the [[Outer Planes]]. Afterward, Yrlimn and Taranath died of exhaustion and Keryth and Jhanra replaced them as the new High Mages.",
        "Activiities": "Keryth was a protege of the high mage [[Pharom Ildacer]]. He, totally fascinated by Myth Nantar, wandered the city in search of new details to eventually excavate. He hoped that in [[1371 DR]] he and his fellow High Mages could clean all the city from corals, restoring it to life."
