'''Barthelby''' was a high-ranking priest of [[Jergal]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
In 1479 DR, an omen reveled that some tombs holy to Jergal inside Undermountain had been forgotten and needed to be tended. Barthelby led an expedition to [[Waterdeep]] in order to rededicate them to Jergal. After a search in Waterdeep's libraries, he and his fellows identified the locations of the tombs and entered Undermountain to do their work and also build a shrine to their god.

Barthelby was waiting for [[Palonya|another priest]] to relieve him but instead the [[undead]] minions of the [[vampire]] [[Dayan]] attacked. Barthelby barricaded himself inside the shrine.

==Personality==
Like all his fellow priests of Jergal, Barthelby was morose. He believed that one day he would die in a horrible way but tried to not think about it. However, he was very scrupulous in his work.
