When Ed was left alone with a newborn, Jons family happily babysat young Kira. Jons nine-year-old daughter Miriam adored the newborn and happily took care of her when Edgin needed help.\nJon and his family babysat Kira when Edgin and his new friend Holga Kilgore embarked on their first heist Pendros Pawnshop in Targos. Nine years later, in the 1490s DR, Jon and Veris youngest child, Sief, accompanied his father to the Trip and Shuffle tavern for dinner and to listen to a red-haired hin minstrels crooning. That was the night when a marauding band of gnolls attacked the tavern after finding their way into Targos. In the chaos and brawl, gnolls got away with the stolen loot and grabbed the four-year-old Sief, leaving Jon distraught, but with his ankle broken, he could not run and rescue his son.\nEdgin, Holga, and their new thieving ally, Forge Fitzwilliam, set out to find the marauders and recover their stolen gold, unaware of a kidnapped child sure to become the hyenas next meal. After a wild fight and cunning use of a nestful of hungry stirges, Sief was rescued and returned to Jon, and it awas the deed that made Edgin and his crew the local heroes."
