Orne the Bloody was the infamous and the most powerful necromancer who was brought down by the Harpers sometime before the mid-14 century DR.
Orne spent almost two decades on the run from Harpers justice. Those Who Harp chaced the villain across ten nations and over a thousand miles. The necromancer switched three bodies, but Harpers brought the villain down in the end. Harpers recovered numerous evil and deadly enchanted items from him, including The Black Satchelâ€Ž. The artifacts were stored in secret secure vaults across the lands to keep them from wrong hands.
