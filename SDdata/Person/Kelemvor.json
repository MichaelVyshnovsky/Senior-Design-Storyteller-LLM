        "mainbody": "Kelemvor, with the help of his uncle, managed to adjust to the curse that he had regrettably inherited and joined Burnes company to become yet another sellsword. For three years, Kelemvor was able to keep his bestial side under control, and though forced into a path he had not chosen for himself and had never wanted, became fond of Burne and his other companions. Still, Kelemvor longed for and dreamed of the life he could have had were it not for his curse and the cruelty of his father.\nUpon his eighteenth birthday, however, all of Kelemvors new life came crashing down around him. In an ambush, Burnes party was slaughtered to a man by Kelemvors eldest brother Guntharr. Filled with rage for his uncles death, Kelemvor awoke the beast within him again and tore both Guntharr and his companions to pieces except those who managed to flee. Horrified and disheartened, Kelemvor fled once again, though he eventually returned to the mercenary lifestyle.\nMore bitter than ever, Kelemvor became resentful of the emptiness in his involuntary career as a sellsword and of the incompetent superiors who hired him. Though Kelemvor could have taken a leadership position for himself, he never did, haunted by memories of his fathers corruption by power. Still, Kelemvor dreamed of a day when he could perform heroic deeds free from the curse, becoming a true hero as in those stories he had read when he was a child in the Lyonsbane castle.\nleft|thumb|Kelemvor and Midnight in Waterdeep\nAfter a time, Kelemvor left his employers behind, pulled by an unexplainable urge to search for something, a prize to give his life meaning but whose form escaped him. It was shortly after this, that he met up with Cyric, Midnight, and Adon of Sune.\nIn a final confrontation with Myrkul on top of Blackstaff Tower, Kelemvor was slain by a still-mortal Cyric, wielding the sword Godsbane. Cyric would later go on to become god of death in place of Myrkul, and Midnight became the new goddess of magic, Mystra.\nHowever, Kelemvors existence was not ended then, for Godsbane, which was actually the god Mask in disguise, siphoned away Kelemvors eternal spirit and hid it from the new Lord of Death. Mask planned to use him to bring about Cyrics downfall and gain Cyrics portfolio over lies. For ten years, Kelemvors spirit lived in this pocket plane, while Cyric searched for him, bent on destroying his former companion for good.\nthumb|200px|Kelemvors holy symbol from the 14 century DR.|\nAfter Cyric murdered Bhaal and ascended to godhood, the first thing he wanted to accomplish was to have Kelemvors soul so that he could gain an advantage over the new Mystra, his most hated rival, and whose portfolio over magic he coveted. However, for ten years after the Time of Troubles, Cyric and his church were unable to find Kelemvors soul, every divination and spell they tried yielded nothing. Cyric suspected that there were traitors within his own church who fostered Kelemvors soul. He later launched the Second Banedeath in the , unleashing his Inquisition on Zhentil Keep, YÃ»lash, Darkhold, Teshwave, and the Citadel of the Raven to cleanse all Zhent holdings of non-Cyricist priests. Cyric also released Kezef the Chaos Hound from Pandemonium, and commanded it to track Kelemvors soul. Kezef ended up being trapped again by Mask.\nMask used Kelemvors soul to gain the cooperation of Mystra, all the while planning a revolt in the City of the Dead against Cyric. With the help of Mystra, Torm, Oghma, and Cyrics own high priest Fzoul Chembryl (whose loyalty lay with the dead Bane), great chaos was caused in two of Cyrics most important bases of faith Zhentil Keep and the City of the Dead. A great number of Cyrics followers lost their faith, thus greatly weakening Cyric himself. Without the will to control the City of the Dead, dead spirits were freed and roamed about the City. In addition, Cyrics nightmare was freed from Dendar the Night Serpent, and the dream found Cyric, causing him to think that Kelemvor had somehow returned to life and to seek revenge. At that moment, Cyric, though a greater power, lost his mind and crushed his sword, which freed Kelemvor, and made his nightmare come true. The two fought, a dead soul against a god. Cyrics fear, indecision, and madness became his defeat, and Kelemvor finally managed to overthrow Cyrics rule in the City. By the wish of all dead spirits and Denizens in the Gray Wastes, Kelemvor became the new God of Death.\nthumb|left|Kelemvor retrieves the soul of a slain warrior.\nTo be the Lord of the Dead is to be the judgment of the departed souls. Being the new Lord Death, Kelemvor wished to clear all the corruptions in the Realms of Death brought by former Lords of Death. He reshaped the Bone Castle, a twisted citadel in the Gray Wastes where Jergal, Myrkul, and Cyric had all ruled from, into the transparent Crystal Spire, its translucency representing that no more should Death be a frightening mystery. While faithful souls would be claimed by their respective deities, faithless souls and those with a false faith that his or her god did not want, were judged before the God of Death. Former Gods of Death would decide whether they were the Faithless or the False. Either way, in the hands of Myrkul or Cyric, these souls eventually ended up being eternally tortured.\nKelemvor, however, was more lenient on those Faithless and False who were virtuous and honorable in life, while the ones who were cowardly or capricious were severely punished. Those souls judged as noble were sent to the then merrier and heaven-like parts in the City of the Dead, such as the Singing City or Pax Cloister, while for thieves and cowards there were hell-like parts of the City such as the Acid Swamps.\nAs a result, honorable and brave mortals no longer feared death, and recklessly threw their lives away, trusting in Kelemvors judgment rather than in benevolent gods. The cowardly and crafty mortals became too fearful to do much, lest they die and find themselves before Kelemvor. This, in combination with Mystras unjust granting of magic, favoring only those who were good, brought unintentional imbalance and robbed the other deities of potential worshipers. Being exposed by Cyric, Kelemvor and Mystra were accused by the Circle of Greater Gods of being guilty of \"Incompetence by Humanity\".\nKelemvor wondered how he could judge the damned, when he himself failed his own personal judgment. He gradually came to realize that there was nothing human in being a god. To correct his mistakes, great changes were undergone in his realm, as well as in himself. The City of the Dead was changed to a gray world, not truly light, not totally dark, simply dull gray. Gone was the good and evil in the City, only indifference and silence remained. The once diamond-like Crystal Spire was also smoked the color of topaz.The novel Crucible The Trial of Cyric the Mad states that Kelemvor also replaced the Wall of the Faithless with a mirrored wall that showed the false and the faithless their reflections in such a way as to reveal the follies and life choices that led them to be sent to his realm. However, the more recent Sword Coast Adventurers Guide sourcebook still describes faithless souls being mortared into the Wall for eternity. As of its November 2020 errata, the Sword Coast Adventurers Guide no longer mentions the Wall of the Faithless. Kelemvor also rid himself of all signs of humanity in order to properly fulfill his duties, which meant replacing the warrior-like human he used to assume with a darkly robed figure, his raven black hair turned to silver, his eyes became pupilless, his appearance aged, his armor tattered and black, and he donned a silver death mask.\nHe then conducted the Re-evaluation, where all souls in the City were to be judged according to new criteria, then be sentenced to new places in the City. Souls being judged would not find torture, but neither would they find joy. They would exist with souls ethically similar to themselves, and it would be up to the inhabitants to make their own lives in the same manner as in the living world.\nthumb|right|The masked Kelemvor.\nDuring the process, Adon (Kelemvor and Mystras mutual friend, as well the patriarch of Mystras new church) was driven mad by Cyrics trickery, losing his faith in Mystra, and had died a faithless soul. Mystra came to Kelemvor and asked for Adons soul, which Kelemvor steadfastly refused since Adon was now one of the Faithless, or perhaps even the False. This, along with Kelemvors loss of passion, eventually caused the breaking up of their relationship. However, as Adons death and apparent faithlessness was in truth caused by Cyric and was not authentic, Kelemvor allowed Adon to reunite with the Lady of Magic not long afterwards."
