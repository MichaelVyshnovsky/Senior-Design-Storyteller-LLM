Hane Cartcoster was a human merchant of Yhaunn in the 14 century DR.
Hane was an anxious woman, always worried about the welfare of her son.
Hane had married a half-orc mercenary and had her son Jarull with him, but her husband died shortly afterwards on a violent adventure. Fearful that her son would meet a similar fate, she fretted for him constantly as he grew into a rebellious young man.
In Kythorn of the , her son Jarull voluntarily joined the cult of Shar in Yhaunn in search of new experiences, only to be kidnapped and taken prisoner by the Thultantharan shade Variance Amatick, who stole his identity and it to manipulate his friend Keph Thingoleir into joining the cult as well.
With her son missing, Hane had the city guard arrest and interrogate Keph, believing he knew what had happened, to no result. She also contacted the famous wizard Strasus Thingoleir and had him attempt to magically divine Jarulls location, also to no effect.
Jarull was finally rescued after more than twenty days of darkness and torture, and sent to the local temple of Ilmater for treatment.
