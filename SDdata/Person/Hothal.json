My Lord Hothal knows deep sorrow at the fate of royal Baerimgrim but grieves also for the future of fair Galadorna if the Unicorn Throne falls empty, to be fought over at this time... or worse, offers sitting room to one whose malice or blundering ignorance will lead the realm into ruin.|Emissary from Lord Hothal, in {{yearlink|764}}}}",
        "Description": "He was mostly seen in full, large, helmless armor.",
        "Relationships": "His men wore full armor, like him, or green-and-silver. He served King [[Baerimgrim]], and fellow baron [[Feldrin]] was an ally.",
        "History": "In the moot called by King Baerimgrim in the {{yearlinkName|764}}, Baron Hothal made a bid to become king, supported by Feldrin, promising he could make peace with [[Laothkund]] by giving them the mines of [[iron]] and [[silver]] in the forest. Despite his backroom dealings being unappreciated by his fellow barons, there was serious consideration for his offer. However, Baron [[Tholone]]'s bid later counted more supporters than his own, making Feldrin desert him and try to make a deal with the others, that he'd support Tholone's too if Hothal was slain on the spot. However, as the King tried to crown Tholone, they were both slain by a spell from [[Nadrathen]]. In the ensuing chaos, Hothal made an attempt to slay Nadrathen, getting himself killed by crossbowmen which were almost certainly mind-controlled by the mage.",
        "Reputation": "He was said to only take off his armor in order to don bigger pieces of armor."
