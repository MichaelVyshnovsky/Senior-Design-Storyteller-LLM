'''Gneissenau''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]], [[alchemist]], and guildmaster of the [[Miners' League]] in [[Eileanar]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Gneissenau managed the Miners' League with the assistance of [[Lebreton]], [[Philo]], [[Jackson]], [[Wackernagel]], [[Ochsenbein]] as their hundreds of members located ore deposits, mined them, and extracted the metals.

==History==
In {{yearlinkConvert|3515|NY}} he developed a procedure that allowed for the processing of [[gold]] from raw ore to completely pure metal. First, [[mercury]] was poured over the ore, which caused it to form an amalgam with the gold and separate it from the other substances. The mercury-gold mixture was then pulled into a storage tank via the suction of a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum]] that was blocked by a screen. It was then transferred into a new chamber where it was heated using a ''portal'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], causing the mercury to boil, separate, and evaporate into a final chamber chilled with a ''portal'' to the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]] where it condensed into a usable form again. The boiling chamber thus contained the pure gold, completely separated from any impurities.
