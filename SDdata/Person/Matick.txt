General Matick was a legendary figure of the Netherese Empire, who invented many of the most popular spells used throughout the Realms. His known spells were General Maticks missile, General Maticks shield, and General Maticks armor. He was also a rare arcanist of  the martial arts and the arcane, like the later rebel Adrian Freeman.
The general was not only a skilled arcanist and inventor, but also a great warrior. Unlike most mages of the era, Matick was both especially strong and robust.
General Matick was said to be relentless and aggressive, particularly towards elves, whom he disdained.
Matick was born in  of the Golden Age of Netheril. He quickly worked his way up the ranks in the army of Seventon and repelled several raids of goblinoids. An extremely successful commander, General Matick had the lowest ally-to-enemy troop loss ratio in the entire history of Netheril. At the Pass of Humaithira, General Matick died in  a last stand against a horde of trolls in .
Matick officially introduced magic missile in  at age 30, shield in  at age 41, and magic armor in  at age 46.
Some sages did not believe that Matick had invented his wildly popular spells, but instead had them commissioned.
