Viv was a halfling trickster in Waterdeep in 1479 DR.
In 1479 DR, Viv joined Enda Yate in her treasure hunt into Undermountain.
When they ventured into Undermountain, Viv remained at the base, not moving at all from her bedroom. She listened to her companions slaughtering some Downshadow folks that arrived nearby.
Viv was a coward, sneaky and self-serving. She was also a good actress.
