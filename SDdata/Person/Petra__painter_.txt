Besides a number of colors, she had a [[silver]]-wrapped [[ivory]] jar that contained a paint of indistinct color, but which she used to paint a dragon's green eyes.

==History==
During the middle of winter of the {{YearlinkName|1362}},{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|22}} Petra stopped at the [[Sembia]]n town of [[Halfknot]] to wait for the roads to dry out. While at the town, she repainted the signs for a few businesses: the town baker, butcher, and hostler. She agreed to do the sign of the [[Dragon Defeated]], a local inn, too, for a few meals. [[Varney]], the owner of the Dragon Defeated, accepted, and commissioned her a sign of a dead [[green dragon]], with a princess, and three regulars at his tavern as the slayers: [[Wyrmbait Nix]], [[Silvenestri Silver]], and [[Badger Bates]].

[[Tenday]]s later, on her last night at the town, she spoke up during the nightly tales at the Dragon Defeated, which had a prize for the most awe-inspiring story. She revealed she was a painter of dragons, and that she knew of them. Showing the people at the tavern some samples of her work, she explained that she'd traveled the width and breadth of the Realms to look at dragons and paint them. She considered she'd shown more of dragons than anyone in the entire season, and that she should be given the prize for the evening.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|28-30}} Petra related that by 1362 DR, she had painted a hundred or so [[green dragon]]s, talked to [[white dragon]]s, and mentioned that she'd drawn [[copper dragon]]s at the [[High Moor]], and all manner of the best-known dragons. Badger Bates, however, demanded that only a painting of [[Malaeragoth]], of which she'd not shown, would make it worth giving her the money. Despite her insistence that she'd painted Malaeragoth from life once, and that he'd sent a servant to steal the painting afterwards, she agreed to do it.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|30-33}}

No matter how much detail she added, however, Badger was left unsatisfied, demanding to see the eyes of Malaeragoth painted, and then painted in the correct shade. She had some apprehensions and warned them, but still painted a picture of Malaeragoth scrying on the inn. After completing her picture, she claimed the prize, and left quickly, before Malaeragoth somehow entered the tavern through her painting and rampaged inside the building, destroying it completely, and killing Badger Bates in the process.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|33-36}}

She later relayed through Wyrmbait Nix that she was sorry for what happened, but that Bates shouldn't have cheated on the bet, and that she'd go further east, to study [[landwyrm]]s.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|36-39}}
