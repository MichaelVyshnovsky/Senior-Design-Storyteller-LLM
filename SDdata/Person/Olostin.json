        "mainbody": "Olostin, also known as the Baron of Dread, was a bandit lord of the Shadowed Age of Netheril. He was a vicious bandit lord who led an extravagant life that rivaled that of the empires own arcanists. He became a rallying force for the disaffected citizens of Netheril, who were angered by the rule of the magocracys leaders.\nIn his youth, Olostin was prone to anger, feeling he was owed great opportunities. He also showed compassion for non-humans like those that invaded Netheril.\nOlostin and his forces dwelled in what became known as Dread Keep, a fortress situated west of the enclave of Unity. \nOlostin was born in Netheril, where he was eventually exiled when his anger became unstable. In the wilds of Netheril, he encountered a lone phaerimm who asked about the magic being cast on the surface that caused his kind to starve. Olostin disclosed all of Netherils secrets to the phaerimm. The phaerimm left, but not before telling him of a secret location in the Far Horns where the arcanists could not reach him.\nOlostin quickly emerged as the most bloodthirsty bandit lord in Netherils history. By the age of 20, he was already railing against the rule of the archwizards. He and his forces attacked the city of Unity in . Others who also shared his distaste for the archwizards joined his cause.\nSome 33 years after his raids began, however, in , a high-level arcanist and a group of 250 warriors attacked Dread Keep and killed Olostin with a Noanars fireball spell. The few notes and scattered plans that survived seemed to indicate that Olostin was in league with the phaerimm, whom the Netherese were still trying to locate."
