        "History": "In [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Marlin Stormserpent paid the artist [[Jharakphred]] to follow two people, Lord Gariskar Dauntinghorn and [[Draskos Crownsilver]] and then paint a portrait of them. The artist shadowed them for days so closely that he had to be beat off by their retinue with cudgels. Marlin then ordered his two [[blueflame ghost]]s, [[Relve Langral]] and [[Treth Halonter]], to learn the men's likenesses from their portraits to better identify and kill those men.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|261|25}}"
