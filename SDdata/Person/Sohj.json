        "mainbody": "Sohj was one of the mages from Estagund who accompanied Aniolon Gruanthe in his exodus from the region. He met his end due to the Evise Jhontil.\nHe was an old man.\nSohj knew at least one teleportation spell.\nHe schooled Aniolon Gruanthe a few years before his death.\nSohj was part of Aniolon Gruanthes company that settled in the Raurin, protected by the Evise Jhontil. When the artifact proved to kill wizards that tried to cast spells in its area of effect, Sohj took charge and began looking for a way to stop it. When everything proved fruitless, he decided the city should be moved when they discovered the barrier preventing egress, he decided to cast a teleportation spell himself, and if successful, hed return and bring others out the same way.\nRather than allow him egress from the area of effect, however, the Evise Jhontil froze him and continuously shifted him between his target location and his starting location."
