        "mainbody": "'''Sohj''' was one of the mages from [[Estagund]] who accompanied [[Aniolon Gruanthe]] in his exodus from the region. He met his end due to the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]''.",
        "Description": "He was an old man.",
        "Abilities": "Sohj knew at least one teleportation [[spell]].",
        "Relationships": "He schooled [[Aniolon Gruanthe]] a few years before his death.",
        "History": "Sohj was part of Aniolon Gruanthe's company that settled in the [[Raurin]], protected by the ''[[Evise Jhontil]]''. When the artifact proved to kill [[wizard]]s that tried to cast spells in its area of effect, Sohj took charge and began looking for a way to stop it. When everything proved fruitless, he decided the city should be moved; when they discovered the barrier preventing egress, he decided to cast a teleportation spell himself, and if successful, he'd return and bring others out the same way.\n\nRather than allow him egress from the area of effect, however, the ''Evise Jhontil'' froze him and continuously shifted him between his target location and his starting location."
