        "mainbody": "Sunrise was a pegasus who lived in the Moonwood with her twin brother Sunset. \nThe pair were rescued from giants by the moon elf Tarathiel a few years prior to 1370 DR, and after this, they served as winged mounts for him and his partner, Innovindil. Sunrise was so named because her mane was highlighted with a yellowish pink color. She was about sixteen hands high with strong muscles."
