        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Namirrha]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] dispatched Verianthraxa and Malygris to assault the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in retaliation for [[Zhentarim]] raids on cult holdings in [[Sembia]]. Malygris' Queen undead form was destroyed, as the Zhent forces were well-prepared for the draconic assault. In the years that followed, Malygris entered into a state of depression and took no interest in anything until meeting [[Shadovar|otherworldy beings]] that were resistant to his tremendous power."
