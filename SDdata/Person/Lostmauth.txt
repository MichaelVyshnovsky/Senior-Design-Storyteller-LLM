'''Lostmauth''' was a [[red dragon]] living on the isle of [[Tuern]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].

==History==
The [[Cult of the Dragon]] sent their leader, [[Severin Silrajin|Severin]] himself, to bargain with Lostmauth for the [[red dragon mask]]. Severin also convinced the mighty dragon to lay waste to the city of [[Neverwinter]], but Lostmauth was slain by adventurers before he could do so.
