Parg was a goblin in the Moonsea in 1489 DR.
Parg was a goblin of Frostfur tribe, who lived under the protection of the stone giant shaman Kranum. After the fall of a meteor, Kranum began to act strange (being secretly possessed by Tyranthraxus). At last, the Frostfur tribe was destroyed by the possessed Kranum and his new allies, the Burning Banner orc tribe led by Narle Shieldbiter.
Parg was the last survivor and was taken by Narle as a slave. Eventually, an adventuring party hired to stop Vorgansharaxs cultists freed him.
Like his fellows, Parg was crude and mischievous rather than evil. After being enslaved, he become a shadow of his former self. He was interested only in escape from his captivity, not caring for answers or vengeance.
