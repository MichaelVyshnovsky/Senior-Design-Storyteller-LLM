}}'''Naxil''' was a former priest of [[Vhaeraun]].

==History==
Naxil trained as a sorcerer and alchemist under his father before joining the [[Church of Vhaeraun]].

In [[1379 DR]], Naxil had recently converted to [[Eilistraee]]. He was patrolling an entry to the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]] when [[Leliana Vrinn]] asked his help in dealing with a strange [[construct]].
Following the construct, Naxil and Leliana inadvertently entered a ''[[gate]]'' leading them to a secret portion of [[Trobriand's Graveyard]]. There, they were attacked by [[ooze]] followers of [[Ghaunadaur]] and Naxil nearly lost his life.
There they met the [[Darksong Knight]] [[Cavatina Xarann]] that had just managed to became again material and together they escaped back to the Promenade.

Later during the [[Ghaunadaur]]'s followers attack to the Promenade Naxil helped Leliana in the battle with a [[ghaunadan]].

The ghaunadan pursued Naxil until he arrived to the Pit where the [[Ghaunadaur]]'s priests were trying to awoke the [[avatar]] of their god.

Naxil was put inside the Pit together with [[Jub]] and [[Mazrol]] but he alone managed to escape, reemerging in a Promenade full only of [[ooze]] and with the [[avatar]] of Ghaunadaur finally awoke. Naxil come with an idea how to defeat the ooze god: sacrificing himself he tricked the avatar into attaching itself to him and after he went through a magical portal that led to a plane of endless mazes. Although Naxil was killed in the process, he trapped Ghaunadaurâ€™s avatar in the mazes.
