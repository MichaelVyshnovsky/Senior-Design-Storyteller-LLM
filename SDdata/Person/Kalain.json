        "mainbody": "'''Kalain''' was a famously eccentric [[half-elf|half-elven]] [[painter]] and former lover of [[Dagult Neverember]] from [[Waterdeep]]. After separating from the then-[[Open Lord]], she started painting [[monster]]s that, thanks to her ability to draw upon the [[Weave]], could come to life.",
        "Personality": "After her relationship ended, Kalain became paranoid, thinking that every stranger she encountered was an assassin sent by Dagult.",
        "Abilities": "By harnessing the Weave, Kalain could bring her monstrous paintings to life.",
        "Possessions": "Kalain's house was a stone [[windmill]] in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Sea_Ward|Sea Ward]] converted into an estate sometime prior to {{yearlinkName|1392}}.{{WDH-time}} By the time she was living there (over a century later), the building had entered a state of disrepair, and became infested with [[rat]]s.",
        "Activities": "When Kalain painted monsters, some of her common subjects included [[ankheg]]s, [[carrion crawler]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, [[ettercap]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[gibbering mouther]]s, [[hell hound]]s, [[manticore]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[mummy|mummies]], and [[werewolves]].",
        "Relationships": "Kalain loved Dagult dearly, and became furious when he broke their relationship off. The monsters she painted were meant to be representations of him.\n\nThe one exception to Kalain's paranoid tendencies was [[Vhaspar Holmdreg]], an elderly [[Church of Ilmater|Ilmatari]] [[priest]] who periodically brought her food, firewood, and painting supplies. He rented a room in the west wing of Kalain's house, and as such was entrusted with a [[key]] to the building.\n\nKalain had earned the loyalty of the rats living in her home, and they were always ready to defend her from attack.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1475}}, Kalain got a commission to paint a portrait of Dagult Neverember. Their meeting sparked a passionate affair that lasted for more than a year, although it began falling apart when Dagult couldn't keep his promises and spent more and more time in [[Neverwinter]], culminating in him choosing the Jewel of the North over Kalain. After this rejection, she began painting monsters and turning them real.\n\nDagult attempted to thoroughly ruin Kalain's career after leaving her, using his authority to separate her from the high society of Waterdeep and having her works and reputation gradually destroyed. This experience drove Kalain mad, and she became a recluse in her own house.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Kalain's home was one of the locations that was potentially said to conceal the entrance to the [[Vault of Dragons]]."
