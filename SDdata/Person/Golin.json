The brothers were acquainted with the retired half-orc fighter named Chester Hearth, who frequented the Golden Goblet Inn in Mossbridges. They considered the fighter to be a talented trapper and thought him to be a fine fellow despite being a half-orc. At one point, the siblings dog was denied breeding with Chesters powerful moorhound named Suzzane.\nWhen the Golden Goblet Inn was established in the late 14 century DR, after The Three Women War, Golin and his brothers became frequent patrons of Georgios fine establishment. The family celebrated Chads 20 birthday at the Goblet."
