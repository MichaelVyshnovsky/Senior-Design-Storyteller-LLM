'''Nalynaul the Shriveled''' was an [[alhoon]] who commanded a small clan of [[wererat]]s in [[Yartar]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Nalynaul was originally based in the depths of [[Gauntlgrym]], where it commanded a ''[[druuth]]'', a community of [[doppelganger]] servants.

Around [[1340 DR]], Nalynaul transformed itself into an illithilich and left the community, leaving it to its own devices provided they continued to pass information to it. However, most of the doppelgangers were soon destroyed by the vengeful illithids of Gauntlgrym.

Nalynaul made a new base in the catacombs beneath [[Yartar]], where it commanded a new group of servants, wererats.

==Relationships==
Two doppelgangers of the ''druuth'' survived, [[Gondyl Ilitheeum]] and [[Semmonemily]]. Semmonemily, a [[Kraken Society]] agent and secret leader of the [[Hand of Yartar]] [[thieves' guild]], continued to work with Nalynaul, to their mutual advantage and a decline in rivalries between the wererats and the thieves.<ref>
