        "mainbody": "Silaril was a woman whose memories were given by Mystra to Elminster at some point.\nMystra gave Silarils memories to Elminster Aumar of the moment when a certain chancellor with black, glittering eyes interrogated the woman. The chancellor himself wore many rings, carried a sword, and put it to her throat atop the walkways of a wall with battlements, where crows roosted. The chancellor warned her that she would die if she refused to answer, and that he would have no more of her lies, but she said nothing in response.\nNo more was known after , when the archdevil Nergal struck down that memory while rummaging across Elminsters mind as a show of displeasure."
