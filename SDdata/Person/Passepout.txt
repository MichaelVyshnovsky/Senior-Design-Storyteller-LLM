Passepout was one of Volothamp Geddarms companions during his adventures.
Slightly rotund, the only thing larger than Passespouts appetite was his belief that women were enamored with him. This belief was usually met with humorous results.
He was the son of the "famous thespians" Idle and Catinflas.
