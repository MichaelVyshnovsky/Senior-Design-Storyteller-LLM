Alia al-Jamal umm Nabil was a skilled sand mage and chief vizier of the House of Asad tribe in the High Desert of west Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Alia was a beautiful middle-aged woman.
Though Alia was soft-spoken, her voice was respected as much as that of her husband and sheikh of the tribe.
Alia often negotiated deals with other desert tribes and made rulings in her husbands absence.
Alia was the sole wife of the tribes leader, Najib bin Kamal al-Asad. Their eldest son was Nabil bin Najib.
