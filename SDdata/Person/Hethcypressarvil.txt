'''Hethcypressarvil''', usually known as '''Cypress''', was the leader of a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell in [[Elversult]]. He ended his mortal life when he was killed by Lady [[Yanseldara]] and he returned as a [[dracolich]]. His spirit resided in a giant [[topaz]] inset into a staff Yanseldara had inherited from her father. Obsessed with his "love" for Yanseldara, he arranged for the staff to be stolen, and kidnapped [[Feng|Lady Feng]] of the [[Shou]] to steal her spirit and bind them forever via a love potion.

Cypress was finally destroyed by the [[Bedine]] witch [[Ruha]] after [[Kao Chou Tang|Prince Tang]] shattered his phylactery in [[1362]].
