'''Haliduth Orspriir''' was a priest of [[Deneir]] and the [[Librarian Supreme]] of the [[Master's Library]] temple of Deneir on [[Iron Dragon Mountain]] in the [[Earthfast Mountains]]..

==History==
Thanks to the blessing of Deneir, Haliduth had lived for at least six centuries by [[1367 DR]]. He rose to lead the [[High Librarian]]s at the Master's Library, and the god himself granted him the title of Librarian Supreme, the highest position in the Deneirrath clergy.

==Activities==
Haliduth Orspriir kept the continually growing but incomplete record of the [[Metatext]], collecting any fragments that high-ranking clerics of Deneir sent to him.

==Personality==
Despite his immense age, Haliduth remained a lively and active man.
