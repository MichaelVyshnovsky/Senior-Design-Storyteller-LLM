Haliduth Orspriir was a priest of Deneir and the Librarian Supreme of the Masters Library temple of Deneir on Iron Dragon Mountain in the Earthfast Mountains..
Thanks to the blessing of Deneir, Haliduth had lived for at least six centuries by 1367 DR. He rose to lead the High Librarians at the Masters Library, and the god himself granted him the title of Librarian Supreme, the highest position in the Deneirrath clergy.
Haliduth Orspriir kept the continually growing but incomplete record of the Metatext, collecting any fragments that high-ranking clerics of Deneir sent to him.
Despite his immense age, Haliduth remained a lively and active man.
