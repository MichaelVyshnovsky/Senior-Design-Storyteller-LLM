Kadran was insanely jealous of Artemis Entreri, whom all considered the best fighter of Calimport, a title Kadran wanted for himself. When Entreri returned to the city and Basadoni offered him a place in the guild, Kadran thought his position was at risk and used all resources of the guild to kill Entreri. However, thanks to the intervention of Bregan Daerthe Entreri survived, and in the end the assassin easily killed Kadran and gained control of the whole guild. \n* The Silent Blade\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Calimport\nCategoryMembers of House Basadoni\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryInhabitants of Calimshan\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryInhabitants\ni47ivt7dmqkfzfs4fal5nehitwer4gg"
