        "mainbody": "celeritas Fel was a diminutive fiendish creature created by Bhaal specifically to serve the Dark Urge in the late 15 century DR.\nSceleritas appeared similar to a male goblin with green skin, red eyes, and black sclera. He was especially thin and bony, with extremely coarse, wrinkled skin. He had black claws on all twenty digits and seemed to have some sort of beak- or horn-like protrusion in place of a nose. He was typically seen wearing black garments, elegant but tattered, with red highlights. Notably, his short top hat featured a snake skeleton curled around it. He also wore white face paint in the shape of a skull.\nAs a creation of Bhaal, Sceleritas was a lover of violence and wickedness. He spoke eloquently, describing despicable acts in flowery prose. He served the Dark Urge singlemindedly, attending to his needs with zealous fervor and verbally self-flagellating whenever he fell short of expectations. He showed great disappointment or even disgust when the Dark Urge resisted his violent nature or acted with kindness in any way. He seemed to enjoy being killed, especially by the Dark Urge.\nWhenever Sceleritas was killed, Bhaal sent another Sceleritas in his place, retaining all of the previous incarnations memories.\nSceleritas was wholly, reverently dedicated to his role as the Dark Urges butler, often encouraging him to perform gruesome deeds and reveling in his masters cruelty.\nHe was disgusted by Orin and wished to see the Dark Urge kill her and claim his rightful place as Bhaals Chosen.\nHe was one of several Butlers created by Bhaal to serve his Chosen. Another Butler named Cruor served Orin, but was killed by her. \nAs a butler, Sceleritas existed to attend to the Dark Urges needs. He often handled communication, scheduling, and information, as well as tidying and/or retrieving the Dark Urges possessions. He also sometimes assisted the Dark Urge with such grim tasks as torture and murder."
