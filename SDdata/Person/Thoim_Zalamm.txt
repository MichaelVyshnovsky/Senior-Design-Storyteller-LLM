Thoim Zalamm was philosophical spectator inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Thoim spent much of its time discussing various topics of interest with a lizardman named Munzrim Marlpar who worked as a bartender at the Misty Beard tavern in Waterdeeps North Ward. Thoim also enjoyed flying over the city at night and observing human behavior. It was careful to avoid surprising wizards, adventurers, and other potentially dangerous folk who might attack it. However, Thoim did enjoy helping adventurers from time to time as they were usually a guaranteed source of entertainment.
Thoims magic standed it in Faer√ªn a long time ago.
