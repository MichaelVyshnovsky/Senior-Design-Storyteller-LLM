'''Thoim Zalamm''' was philosophical [[spectator]] inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Thoim spent much of its time discussing various topics of interest with a [[lizardman]] named [[Munzrim Marlpar]] who worked as a bartender at [[the Misty Beard]] tavern in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. Thoim also enjoyed flying over the city at night and observing [[human]] behavior. It was careful to avoid surprising [[wizard]]s, [[adventurer]]s, and other potentially dangerous folk who might attack it. However, Thoim did enjoy helping adventurers from time to time as they were usually a guaranteed source of entertainment.

==History==
Thoim's [[magic]] standed it in [[Faer√ªn]] a long time ago.
