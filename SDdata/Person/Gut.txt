High Priestess Gut was a True Soul and the spiritual leader of the cult of the Absolute during the late 15 century DR.
Like others of her kind, Gut shared a psychic connection with the other "True Souls" of the Absolute. While her powers originated from an illithid tadpole implanted within her brain, Gut believed they came from her connection to her "goddess".
High Priestess Gut wielded a magical goblin warboard in combat and wore a talisman of the Absolute.
She was responsible for branding Absolute cultists with a brand that identified them to others of their order.
Gut worked alongside the other True Soul leaders of the cult, the hobgoblin warlord Dror Ragzlin, and the drow Minthara.
The ogre Polma served as the the high priestess personal bodyguard.
