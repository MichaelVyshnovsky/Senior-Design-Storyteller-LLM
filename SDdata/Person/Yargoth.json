Aided by her captain [[Kurlog]], Yargoth and her kin sought to overthrow the domain of the [[gnome]] [[Zox Clammersham]] and take his [[magic]]al ring that allowed him to control the [[scaladar]] of the Graveyard.",
        "Description": "As a leader, Yargoth was known for being particularly ruthless. While she led a sizable band of her own kin, Yargoth served an even more formidable leader, the warlord [[Doomcrown]].",
        "History": "During her foray into Trobriand's Graveyard, Yargoth and her raiders discovered and acquired three ''[[flame cannon]]s'', particularly powerful siege weapons that were powered by ''[[alchemist's fire]]''."
