        "mainbody": "Yargoth the Breaker was the warlord of the hobgoblin clan that established a camp within Trobriands Graveyard in Undermountain during the 15 century DR. Aided by her captain Kurlog, Yargoth and her kin sought to overthrow the domain of the gnome Zox Clammersham and take his magical ring that allowed him to control the scaladar of the Graveyard.\nAs a leader, Yargoth was known for being particularly ruthless. While she led a sizable band of her own kin, Yargoth served an even more formidable leader, the warlord Doomcrown.\nDuring her foray into Trobriands Graveyard, Yargoth and her raiders discovered and acquired three flame cannons, particularly powerful siege weapons that were powered by alchemists fire."
