        "History": "The young, brash Smergadas attempted to settle in the Dessarin Valley in an area very near to the town of [[Red Larch]], having taken a liking to the region. After flying around for a day without opposition, he feasted on local deer, then landed to rest. [[Claugiyliamatar]], unhappy with Smergadas' presence within her territory, flew out and picked up a massive boulder from the top of a mountain and dropped it on him while he slept, killing him. She then feasted on his remains.\n\nThe boulder, as left by Claugiyliamatar, would come to be known locally as [[Lance Rock]]."
