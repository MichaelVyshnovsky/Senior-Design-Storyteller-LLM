'''Yrre''' the Sparkstruck was an eccentric [[gnome]] inventor from the [[Underdark]] who famously crafted numerous lightning-themed [[weapon]]s and pieces of [[armor]] during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Lightning is like [[magic]]. And what is magic but life itself?|Yrre the Sparkstruck.}}

==Personality==
Yrre was thoroughly obsessed with the power of lightning storms, and included some element of electricity or lightning in all their creations.

==Activities==
{{Quote|The question is - why not create another weapon with spikes like lightning bolts?|Yrre, when asked why they created a [[trident]] twice their size.}}
Among Yrre's first inventions was the ''[[Speedy Lightfeet]]'', a pair of boots that allowed the wearer to accumulate an electric charge within  their body, by making even the smallest of movements. Yrre's weapons often imbued the wielder with the same sort of lightning charge â€• which itself bolstered their physical prowess, agility and overall might. The charge could also be used to offer the user greater protection from physical harm, including electric shock itself, and even a form of retaliation against their foes.

Yrre was regularly shocked and electrocuted by many of their own inventions. To protected themself and others nearby, Yrre crafted the ''[[Jolty Vest]]'' suit of armor.

==Possessions==
Yrre's favorite weapon was the ''[[Joltshooter]]'', a bow with giant spikes that extended out from its shaft. They cared little for bows but really enjoyed the giant spikes. Other inventions of theirs included the ''[[Sparkle Hands]]'' gloves, the ''[[Real Sparky Sparkwall]]'' shield, and the ''[[Protecty Sparkswall]]'' set of clothes, among others.

==Relationships==
Yrre's life changed dramatically when they met the [[Mystran]] cleric [[Lenore De Hurst]] and romance sparked anew. They crafted numerous magical items together, including the ''[[Sparkswall]]'' ring. While apart however, Lenore and Yrre each entered into something of a rut in their individual lives.

==History==
The first time Yrre left their home in the [[Underdark]] they encountered a terrific storm. It was on that occasion that Yrre became obsessed with the might of lightning and electricity; from then on, they were dedicated to recreating that terrible power in all their inventions.

On one occasion, Yrre went to visit Lenore in [[Arcane Tower|her tower]] within the Underdark with, intent on gifting her the magical staff ''[[Spellsparkler]]''. They found her tower completely uninhabited, save for some of her abandoned arcane creations and experiments.

Over time, several of Yrre's creations had been scattered across the [[Sword Coast]] and Underdark. A handful of them came into the possession of Councilor [[Florrick]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].
