Kerima al-Zahir was a human flame mage and member of the Brotherhood of the True Flame in Zakhara.
Kerimas short temper matched her passion for her torrid magical specialization, leading her to challenge many lesser wizards to personal combat, usually to the death.
Kerima only lost two personal challenges against other wizards. Both of those wizards were slain by holy slayers shortly after their duels.
