'''Zoartik''' was one of the most violent [[mind flayer]]s of [[Ch'Chitl]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Zoartik suffered from a mental problem: he could not completely sublimate the mind of his original [[drow]] host. This caused homicidal reactions every time that Zoartik saw drow or even drow-made items. Unconsciously, Zoartik was trying to finally suppress the remains of the drow personality
