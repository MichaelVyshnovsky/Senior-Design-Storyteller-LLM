        "Description": "Kyleena had delicate feature, piercing pale eyes, and condescending facial expression.",
        "Personality": "Kyleena Moonglow felt superior to other races of [[Faer√ªn]], especially civilized ones. She was beloved by her tribe who thought her the bravest chieftain they have ever had. Any land that the tribe claimed was considered by Kyleena to be her property, even if the land did not belong to her. She did not allow any outsider in her lands to travel without her permission.\n\nKyleena's defender and her second in command was the Captain of the Guard, a muscled and stern male wild elf.\n\nThe chieftain and her tribe respected diplomats and were willing to negotiate.",
        "Possessions": "Kyleena wore her [[enchanted]] [[Chult]]an ''[[Kyleena's silken armor|armor]]'' of wood and [[spidersilk]]. In her tent, the chieftain had a minor enchanted [[amulet]], a ''[[glittering necklace]]'', and unique enchanted [[helmet]], the ''[[Spirit of the Predator]]''. Among her more mundane possessions, she had several [[jar]]s of various [[dye]]s.",
        "History": "Kyleena Moonglow and her tribe hailed from the jungles of Chult. At some point in or before 1372 [[DR]], her tribe was pushed out of their high-canopy forests by [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]]' encroaching civilization. After continually moving north from their home, the tribe found a wild area of Lonely Barrens with its forests and streams that the wild elves claimed as their own. Feeling that the land belonged to them, Kyleena's elves wanted to see the local farmers gone from their lands. The tribe created dams out of boulders on their land and withheld irrigation and fresh water from the [[Daggerford]]'s farmlands. This sudden drought attracted the attention of Captain [[Frederick]], the leader of Daggerford's guard. However, due to recent strife, he was unable to spare any men to  take care of the farmers' harassment.\n\nAt some point, a [[halfling]] [[bard]] Petrello became infatuated with Kyleena Moonglow and imposed his serviced on her, calling himself the \"Court Composer\". Even though Kyleena did not share the hin's affection nor considered him to be the part of her tribe. But she allowed him to entertain her on occasion with music and songs.\n\nEventually, Frederick rolled the aid of the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who negotiated on behalf of the city-state with Kyleena Moonglow. The chieftain knew of Captain Frederick and respected him. When confronted with possible outcome of her actions, Kyleena agreed to break the dams. She felt that the Hero's words were a threat veiled in diplomacy. Kyleena did not fear the Hero nor Daggerford's retaliation, but she did not want to endanger her tribe. As the result, she promised to move her clan into the [[Misty Forest]], to the east of Delimbiyr Vale."
