Sluuguth was convinced by Gromph to free him from the sphere using his psionic powers in exchange for great recompense. Gromph and Sluuguth traveled to the Archmage's quarters in [[Sorcere]], and Sluuguth tried to trick Gromph using \"[[thought bottles]]\" of his own design. Gromph defeated Sluuguth, sealing his soul into a magical axe."
