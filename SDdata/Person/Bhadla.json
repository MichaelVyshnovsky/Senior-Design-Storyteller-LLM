        "mainbody": "hadla was a guide that lived in the Anauroch desert during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nLike other Dtarig, Bhadla was rather short, standing about  tall. He dressed in a white burnoose and wore a turban upon his head.\nBhadla was a pragmatic and unscrupulous man that took advantage of situations to benefit himself, so long as he could get away without harm. He was not above scavenging from the dead, or betraying those with whom he worked.\nLike many others of his kin he acted largely out of fear and suspicion, in part due to the threat the Zhent influence posed on all the peoples of the desert.\nWhile working as a spy for the Zhentarim, Bhadla was given a ring of invisibility.\nBhadla worked with an assistant named Musalim, who aided him during his travels across the desert.\nIn the , Bhadla and Musalim began working for Lander, an agent of the Harpers that was working against the Zhentarim.\nAfter riding across the desert with Musalim Lander to El Rahalat, a sandstorm separated the trio and left the Harper to brave the harsh winds of the desert alone. Bhadla made his way to El Rahalat, to attend to his master Yhekal during his meeting with Sheikh Saar of the Bait Mahwa. His treachery was revealed when Lander managed to arrive at the meeting just in time to appeal to the sheikh.\nBhadla continued his work for Yhekal and the Zhentarim, using magic invisibility to spy on a meeting between the sheikhs of the Bait Mahwa and the Razhadi at the Well of the Chasm. He took on one final mission with a Zhent assassin to kill Lander once and for all. While Bhadla managed to inflict upon the Harper a wound with a poison-laced blade, he died moments later when his throat was slit by the sorceress Ruha."
