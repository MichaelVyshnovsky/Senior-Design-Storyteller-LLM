'''Sniden Elkslodge''' was an old apprentice inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Though he was fifteen years his elder, Sniden was apprenticed to [[Derf]] and worked in [[Derf's Skin Art]] learning the trade of decorating a person's body with tattoos and piercings. He gained notoriety for tattooing map on a [[dwarf]]'s back once.
