Eddard Silvershield was a young nobleman from the wealthy Silvershield family of Baldurs Gate.
Eddard was the son of Grand Duke Entar Silvershield.
At some point during the iron crisis of 1368 DR, Eddard traveled with a caravan to his home city of Baldurs Gate. However, the caravan was assailed en route by bandits and Eddard was killed.
The dwarven mercenary leader Kagain led a search for Eddards whereabouts, as his outfit was responsible for the caravans safety, though the young noble was already dead for some time.
