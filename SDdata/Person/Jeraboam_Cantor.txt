'''Jeraboam Cantor''' was a high-ranking [[Harper]] [[bard]] who was active many years before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Jeraboam Cantor's most notable deed was the commission of magical [[amulet]]s many years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He ordered the creation of the first ''[[amulets of will]]'', to shield kids of Harper spies from enemy mindrims and and interrogations. The irony of this achievement was that Jeraboam was the first Harper to be captured by the organization's enemies while wearing an ''amulet of will''. Once the magic jewels was removed, it exposed Jeraboam's weak mind and all of his secrets were extracted.
