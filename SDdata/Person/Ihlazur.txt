During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]], Ihlazur emerged from a stray ''[[portal]]'' between the Demonweb Pits and the [[Underdark]] near [[Sschindylryn]]. He began fighting everything in sight in the hopes of a good challenge, and upon finally being bested happily dissolved back to his [[Abyss]]al home.
