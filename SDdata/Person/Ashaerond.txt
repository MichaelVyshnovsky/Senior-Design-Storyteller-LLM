Ashaerond was a merchant who lived in Westgate on the Dragon Coast and lived prior to 1369 DR.
Ashaerond gave generously to the Church of Ilmater, in case of needing the Ilmataris help one day. Ashaerond explained "If I pay for one extra potion today, it may be the last one tomorrow—but the one needed then to heal me."
