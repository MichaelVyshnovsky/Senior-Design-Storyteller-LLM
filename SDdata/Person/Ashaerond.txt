'''Ashaerond''' was a merchant who lived in [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] and lived prior to [[1369 DR]].

Ashaerond gave generously to the [[Church of Ilmater]], in case of needing the Ilmatari's help one day. Ashaerond explained "If I pay for one extra [[potion]] today, it may be the last one tomorrow—but the one needed then to heal me."
