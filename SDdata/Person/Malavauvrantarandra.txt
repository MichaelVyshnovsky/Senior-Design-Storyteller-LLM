'''Malavauvrantarandra''', or '''Malavauvra''' for short, was an [[dragon aging|ancient]] [[steel dragon]] who lived on the continent of [[Arandron]] on [[Toril]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-28 - Velsaertirden}}

==Description==
Malavauvra was aged and unwell and weak, a condition that made her vulnerable.

==Relations==
Malavauvra's mate was [[Phaudrantanthildrar]] (Phaudron), a withdrawn and focused scholar researching draconic longevity. Malavauvra had laid a number of clutches of eggs in her lifetime, but her last was in poor shape: most of her young were sickly and died as hatchlings or within their first year. Only [[Velsaertirden]], [[Rauvrahrileenatandrar]], and [[Torthalindrarron]] survived.

==Lair==
The family laired within the castle of [[Steelspires]], which had been built for them by [[stone giant]]s. It stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of [[Haunvaerune]].

==History==
When her children grew to become "dragonets", capable of taking [[human]] form and switching forms with ease, Malavauvra encouraged them to explore the neighboring human city of Haunvaerune.

Some time around the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], Malavauvra was murdered in her sleep by her own daughter, Rauvrahreene, using [[magic]] stolen from her father, after killing him the same way. She then seized control of Steelspires, turning it against her brothers.
