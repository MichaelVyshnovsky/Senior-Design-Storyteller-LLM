Faxhal Xoram was a noble of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
He was a close friend of Renaer Neverember.
Faxhal was almost identical in appearance to Renaer, with a difference in height of only a few inches. He was broad-shouldered and brawny, clean-shaven, with shoulder-length brown hair, and square-jawed with chiseled features.
Faxhal died saving Renaer and friends while investigating the kidnapping of Vajra Safahr in 1479 DR.
