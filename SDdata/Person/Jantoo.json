        "mainbody": "'''Jantoo''' was a [[philosophy|philosopher]] working in [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She considered by many to be the greatest philosopher alive.",
        "Activities": "Two of her most famous papers focused on free will. One proved conclusively that mankind had free will, the other proved that it did not. Jantoo could either argue for or against any issue,  depending on her whim.\n\nShe publicly said that she would marry a man who could defeat her in a debate, and hence remained single by [[1358 DR]]."
