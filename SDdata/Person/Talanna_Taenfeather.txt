Talanna Taenfeather was a member of the City Watch of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
She was a close friend of Araezra Hondyl, her commander. She flirted with the Open Lord Dagult Neverember although they were apparently not yet lovers.
Talanna was considered the fastest member of the guard and was usually the one who chased down suspects who fled.
Talanna had a ring of featherfall given to her by the Open Lord after she was seriously injured in a fall from a rooftop. The ring allowed her to fall from a height at a slow rate.
Talanna had bright red hair, which she often wore in exotic hairstyles.
