'''Belvyn''' was a businessman in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was the owner of [[Belvyn's House of Good Cheer]], a combined [[festhall]], all-faiths temple, and rental hall.

==Personality==
[[Volo]] described him as "a sly, belly-rubbing rogue if ever I saw one", and he would know.

==Activities==
Belvyn charged 25 [[gp]] a night for hiring the hall, typically as either a festhall or a temple, while funerals were free of charge.
