        "mainbody": "avil Mereshanter was a mage in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nSome time before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Kavil went to study in Dweomercore but was refused and Halaster Blackcloak stole his spellbook. The Mad Mage promised to give the book back if he became the apprentice and the biographer of Netherskull inside the Obstacle Course level. Kavil agreed but Netherskull distrusted wizards and wouldnt give interviews, so Kavil found it very difficult to collect information needed for the biography. So Kavil invented most of the life-story for Netherskull, hoping to somehow impress Halaster (in truth, the Mad Mage had simply misplaced his spellbook).\nKavil could be found inside a room in the level busy writing his journals. He was protected by two invisible nycaloths.\nKavil hoped to impress Halaster with the sensationalism of his writing. He was a coward."
