        "mainbody": "'''Kavil Mereshanter''' was a [[mage]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Some time before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Kavil went to study in [[Dweomercore]] but was refused and [[Halaster Blackcloak]] stole his [[spellbook]]. The Mad Mage promised to give the book back if he became the apprentice and the biographer of [[Netherskull]] inside the [[Obstacle Course]] level. Kavil agreed but Netherskull distrusted wizards and wouldn't give interviews, so Kavil found it very difficult to collect information needed for the biography. So Kavil invented most of the life-story for Netherskull, hoping to somehow impress Halaster (in truth, the Mad Mage had simply misplaced his spellbook).",
        "Activities": "Kavil could be found inside a room in the level busy writing his journals. He was protected by two invisible [[nycaloth]]s.",
        "Personality": "Kavil hoped to impress Halaster with the sensationalism of his writing. He was a coward."
