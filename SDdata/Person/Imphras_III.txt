Imphras Heltharn III was a crown prince of Impiltur.
Imphras was the eldest son of King Lashilmbrar the Sly. His mother was named Thelmara Rorntarn. His younger brother was Rilimbrar, who would become the next king.
Imphras III was born in 1276 DR but was assassinated at the age of eighteen years in a staged bandit attack on the kings summer residence by Imphras step-cousin Prince Thaum, which also slew his father, the king. This made his younger brother the new king and marked Thaum as the next crown prince.
