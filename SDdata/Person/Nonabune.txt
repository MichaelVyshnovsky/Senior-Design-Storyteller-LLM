{{quote|That. Was. Incredible! And just think what a story it'd make: "When Fish Fight Back"! I mean, if "When Fish Fight Back" doesn't tickle your fancy, how about... I don't know. That was the best one, to be honest.|Nonabune}}

==Description==
Nonabune was a [[hin]] man with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and long dark brown hair.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Nonabune could be found in the docks of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate, where commoners could buy fresh [[fish]]. The docks were attacked by a band of [[sahuagin]] when the area was visited by the [[Absolute Adversaries]], if was unknown if Nonabune survived the attack.
