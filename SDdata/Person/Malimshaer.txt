Malimshaer was a scout nycaloth and member of the Trio Nefarious and strategist of the Army of Darkness.
Malimshaer was first summoned to the Realms by the Netherese archwizard Aldlas Sodhese. Aldlas set him forth on a task to locate the Nether Scrolls, thought to be somewhere in elven lands. For three months the Trio Nefarious ravaged the elven lands until they met with the army of Cormanthyr and were captured and imprisoned. Nearly two millennia later they escaped and began raising an army that soon descended upon Cormanthyr.
