Yarin was a retired pickpocket from the the capital of Amn, Athkatla during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Yarin owned gloves of pickpocketing. Among other items, he had a potion of extra healing stashed away, as well as a scroll of melfs acid arrow, next to a History of Shadowdale tome.
At some point before the , Yarin retired from the life of thievery and spent his time in the illicit backrooms of the Copper Coronet in the slums of Athkatlas River District. He was aware of the recently raging guild war in the city, but he was not a member of the Shadow Thieves. At some point, he was approached by a member of the new guild, secretly a vampire coven, trying to recruit Yarin. The new mysterious guild was not picky in who they recruited younglings and old men like Yarin were among them, and the offer was quite lucrative. However, Yarin had little interest in returning to the rogues life.
