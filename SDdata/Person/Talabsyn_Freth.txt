Talabsyn Freth was a young drow of House Freth in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
As youngest daughter of her House, Talabsyn led some male drow in taking care of the giant lizards around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR. She was willing to abandon any of the males and surrender to enemies if she was sure of a ransom.
