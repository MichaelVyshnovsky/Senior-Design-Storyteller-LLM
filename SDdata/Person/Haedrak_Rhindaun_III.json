        "mainbody": "His Royal Highness, King '''Haedrak Errilam Alemander Olosar Lhorik Rhindaun III''' was the husband of Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda]] of [[Tethyr]] and as such was the Monarch's Consort. He was also the Duke-Protector of the [[Crown Lands]] and Crown Regent for the heir to the throne. He was the first king of the [[Rhindaun Dynasty]].\n\nUnder the name '''Lhaeo''', Haedrak had been [[Elminster]]'s scribe, yet in [[1368 DR]] he was informed by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] that he was also the last living prince of [[Tethyr]]. With the help of [[Zaranda Star]], his future wife, he reclaimed that nation in the name of the monarchy and became King Haedrak III a year later.",
        "Description": "Haedrak was tall, had dark brown hair, and sported a finely trimmed goatee. Due to a blessing from [[Siamorphe]], in [[1370 DR]], while in his mid- to late-30s, he appeared fifteen years younger.\n\nDuring his time as the apprentice Lhaeo, Haedrak intentionally never sat or stood up straight and maintained an effeminate demeanor. He spoke in a lisp in a high voice, but all of this was a facade.",
        "Personality": "As king, Haedrak often played the part of an absent-minded scholar, letting his wife rule the country. However, in fact, he was wise and intelligent with an extraordinary memory. He also had a witty sense of humor.\n\nHaedrak was especially skilled at calligraphy and cartography.",
        "Possessions": "Haedrak's primary crown, the [[King's Coronet]], protected him with a ''[[mind blank]]'' spell at all times. On official occasions, he wore the [[King's Crown]], a relic from the time of King [[Coram III]]. It had many magical effects added to it by Eliminster and Alustriel. His chief weapons were a ''[[sword of quickness|short sword of quickness]]'' and the [[Lion's Sword]], a ''[[flame tongue]]'' [[longsword]].",
        "Background": {
            "Childhood": "Haedrak was born in [[Silverymoon]] on the [[Feast of the Moon]] in the [[1335 DR|Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR]]. He was the second<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note2\">Book 3 of ''[[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|Lands of Intrigue]]'' marks him as the third son; Book 1 claims he was the second. son of King [[Alemander IV]] and Queen [[Rhinda]] of [[Saradush]]. At his birth, his mother named him Lhaeo, but this was for his protection. Lhaeo was an anagram for the initials of his full royal name, \"<u>H</u>aedrak <u>E</u>rrilam <u>A</u>lemander <u>O</u>losar <u>L</u>horik III\". It was not until the boy reached that age of adulthood at sixteen years that Elminster told him his true heritage.\n\nWhen the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Ten Black Days of Eleint|Ten Black Days of Eleint]] fell in [[1347 DR]], Lhaeo's entire family was slain. Lhaeo himself was far from Tethyr and only a select few knew that the heir to Tethyr's throne existed.",
            "Reclamation Wars": "During the first part of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]], Lhaeo was Elminster's scribe in [[Shadowdale]]. In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun revealed to Lhaeo that he was in fact Haedrak III, son of King Alemander, the rightful heir to the throne of Tethyr. Lhaeo had no desire to rule as king and at first refused to listen to Khelben, but after being shown a collection of royal regalia and speaking with [[Sylun√©]], he at last agreed to take on the responsibility.\n\nA fake \"Lhaeo\" illusion was created by Elminster, and Haedrak began his quest. For several months, he trained with [[Storm Silverhand]] in swordcraft and continued to develop his arcane talents.\n\nHe first traveled to [[Voonlar]], where he met the exiled [[wizard]]ess [[Perendra Raslemtar]]. The two traveled to Silverymoon, where they worked out a plan with [[Alustriel]] and Khelben to assist Zaranda in taking back Tethyr.\n\nBy autumn of that year, Haedrak arrived in [[Waterdeep]], where he was recognized officially as Prince Haedrak by Lord [[Piergeiron]] and built up a large number of allies and gathered an army. He sailed to [[Zazesspur]] and assisted in retaking the city for Zaranda Star. It was learned that she herself was a prisoner in [[Myratma]], however, so Haedrak set out to rescue her.\n[[File:Escape from Shoonach.png|thumb|right|270px|''[[Timoth Eyesbright]], [[Zaranda Star]], [[Purlakhonthiis]], and Haedrak Rhindaun III escaping from the ruins of [[Shoonach]].'']]\nShe was eventually rescued from [[Shoonach]] by Haedrak with the help of his platinum-scaled [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]], [[Purlakhonthiis]], and the [[centaur]] [[Timoth Eyesbright]]. They returned with haste to Myratma to assist in the siege there.\n\nThe siege and the war ended at the beginning of the next year, the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]]. The war ended with a final duel between Prince Haedrak and Prince [[Yusuf Jhannivvar]], the Pretender. Haedrak was victorious and disarmed the false ruler, but when he turned, Yusuf stabbed Haedrak with a hidden dagger and was immediately shot dead by an arrow from Zaranda.",
            "Coronation & Wedding": "After the war, Haedrak took the surname \"Rhindaun\" in honor of his mother, Rhinda.\n\nHaedrak and Zaranda were married in three separate ceremonies on the [[Kythorn 30|30th]] of [[Kythorn]] of that year at the [[Convent of St. Rhynda]]. During the final ceremony, performed by a priestess of Siamorphe, the couple was bathed in light, a divine sign of their nobility.\n\nTheir coronation occurred in the following month, in the restored royal fortress of [[Faerntarn]]. Again, the blessings of Siamorphe were upon them, for the crowns placed themselves magically upon Zaranda and Haedrak's heads."
        },
        "Relationships": "[[File:Lhaeo Elminster Mourngrym & Dwalimar.png|thumb|250px|''[[Dwalimar Omen]] and [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] engaged in the relic-measuring contest as [[Mourngrym Amcathra]] and [[Lhaeo]] feel fatigued by it.'']]\nHaedrak was once a lover of Storm Silverhand. When he first returned to Tethyr to assist Zaranda Star in the Reclamation Wars, he intended to simply have a political marriage with Zaranda. However, he soon fell in love with Zaranda and broke off his relationship with Storm. (Interestingly enough, this was the first time that anyone had chosen duty over a relationship with her.) Zaranda had found herself jealous of Storm, but as the latter woman was a [[Harper]], she was not welcome in Tethyr anyway.\n\nHaedrak had three children with Zaranda: Princess [[Sybille Rhindaun|Sybille]], Prince [[Coram Rhindaun|Coram]], and Princess [[Cyriana Rhindaun|Cyriana]].\n\nHaedrak was often accompanied by his familiar, Purl, who accompanied him on his adventures during the Reclamation Wars.\n\nHaedrak was one of the few people keen enough to suspect Duke [[Inselm Hhune]] was plotting against the crown. The king and queen allowed the secret leader of the [[Knights of the Shield]] to control his duchy so that they could keep an eye on him.",
        "Works": "Under his pseudonym \"Lhaeo\", Haedrak wrote a small work of poetry titled, ''Translations from [[Kara-Tur]] Haiku''. He was also the author of the great ''[[Historia Tethyra]]''."
