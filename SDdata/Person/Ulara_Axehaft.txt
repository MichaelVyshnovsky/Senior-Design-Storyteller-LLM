Battle Chaplain Ulara Axehaft was a priestess of Tempus who lived in Scardale Town in the mid-14 century DR.
Ulara founded the Shrine of Crossed Swords in 1362 DR to cater to the foreign garrisons that occupied the city following the second inter-dale war. Due to the militaristic temperament of the citys newfound occupants, the shrine flourished in the years following its establishment.
