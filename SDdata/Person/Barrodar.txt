'''Barrodar''' was a successful merchant and shopkeeper inhabiting the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Barrodar owned [[Barrodar's Fantastic Fabrics]] in the western section of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]]. The role of successful businessman was a mere facade. Barrodar was actually the top fence within Zhentil Keep following the city's destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. Allied to no one, he served his own best interests and only dealt with someone he knew.

==History==
He lost his first business during Zhentil Keep's destruction but bounced back quickly. Within just three days, Barrodar took control of an abandoned shop and started his new venture.
