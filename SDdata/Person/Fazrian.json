        "History": "Fazrian originally served [[Torm]], until being called down by a [[cleric]] in Undermountain.\n\nArriving there, Fazrian was disgusted by the corruption and sought to cleanse it. Fazrian failed to realize it was slowly becoming more bloodthirsty and eventually slaughtered the cleric who had summoned it, along with her companions.\n\nFazrian then proceeded to take control of the Terminus Level. [[Halaster Blackcloak]] sent Fazrian a host of four [[yugoloth]]s to command, in exchange for payment. The four included the [[arcanaloth]]s [[Aximus]] and [[Exekarus]], the [[ultroloth]] [[Xindulus]], and the [[nycaloth]] [[Raxxus]]."
