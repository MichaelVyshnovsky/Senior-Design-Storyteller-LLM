        "mainbody": "'''Nibulus Loral''' was a scholar and a [[sage]] who spent his later years studying the natural life in [[Cormyr]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "He spent much of his life as a [[wizard]] by trade, helping others by [[Item enchantment|enchanting]] [[weapon]]s and protecting them from monstrous beasts. As he slowed down in his golden years, he gained an appreciation for the simple joys of life, especially taking a newfound regard for the varied species of nature. He traveled around Cormyr and began to record his observations while sketching the various flowers and plants he came across. He spent a significant amount of time in the inhospitable [[Thunder Peaks]] and [[Storm Horns]] mountains.",
        "History": "During one of his sojourns to study life in the mountains, while seeking out a species of rare wildflower, Nibulus met the fellow naturalist [[Elminster Aumar]]. While Nibulus was so focused on the scientific relationship between wildflowers and local insects, by studying and sketching their form, Elminster reminded the Cormyrian scholar that a moment should be taken to appreciate the beauty of life.\n\nIn their talks, Nibulus shared his experiences in the Thunder Peaks mountains, which piqued Elminster's interest. The sage of [[Shadowdale]] stated he was arranging a compilation of collected writings about the natural world of the [[Interior Faer没n|central]] and [[north Faer没n]]. Nibulus offered to submit his notes to the anthology, which were assembled into a book called ''[[The Storm Horns and the Thunder Peaks]]''. Nibulus hoped that his contributions would help dispel some of the legends and misconceptions about life in the mountains that were commonly held by the people of Faer没n."
