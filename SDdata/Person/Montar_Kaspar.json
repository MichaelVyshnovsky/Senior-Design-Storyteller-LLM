        "mainbody": "'''Montar Kaspar''' was a [[half-elf]] [[cavalier]] and the baron of the city of [[Kaspar]] in [[Ulgarth]] around [[1367 DR]]. He chose the name \"Montar Kaspar\" for himself, it meant \"defender of Kaspar\".",
        "Activities": "Baron Kaspar governed the barony and city of Kaspar and also had the responsibility of defending the realm against the [[Barbarian lands (Utter East)|barbarians of the eastern plains]]. He also commanded his own barony's army, He led his forces into battle himself, which earned him the appreciation of his troops. He kept their morale high through a mix of trust, harsh discipline, and indulging their greed, by sharing the loot of a battle and captured horses fairly among the troops.\n\nIn particular, Baron Kaspar led an elite cavalry company, mounted on the superb [[Dambraii]] [[horse]]s that he personally had imported from [[Dambrath]]. These made them the swiftest cavalry company in the kingdom, able to easily pursue or retreat from barbarian hordes.",
        "Personality": "He also loved horses with passion. His own mount was [[Firefiex]], reputed to be the swiftest steed in the kingdom."
