Verik was a member of the Cult of the Dragon in the Moonsea in 1489 DR.
Verik was a very good liar and spy.
Verik was part of a Cult traditionalist faction under the wizard Ixas.
In 1489 DR, he was sent to a small village on a isle not too far from Phlan, where a great fiendish power was hidden. He infiltrated the village while acting as a madman. He also befriended Elisande. When an adventuring party arrived in the village, to investigate rumors of dracoliches and ghost ships, they may have discovered and killed him.
