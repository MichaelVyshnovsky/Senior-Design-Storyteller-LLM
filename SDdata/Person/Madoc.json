        "mainbody": "Madoc, more commonly known as Madoc the Uncouth, was a shady merchant from the region of the Moonsea and a disgraced member of the Zhentarim in the late-14 century DR.\nMadoc was a short and stout balding dwarf with graying beard.\nMadoc the Uncouth was a rude and easy-to anger person who was generally considered a poor company. Despite the attitude, Madoc was a successful merchant. He valued a cold ale and a warm lass on his knee.\nthumb|Madoc the Uncouth, his smoking pipe, at a campfire.|380x380px\nMadoc ran a small caravan that traveled across the cities of the Moonsea. A halfling carpenter and caravaner Anders was his only employee. Madocs caravan worked with the Shield Trading Company in the city of Voonlar.\nIn the , Madoc took his caravan from the Dalelands to the city of Voonlar. Weary of vengeance of his previous employer - the Black Network, and the recent fiend raids on the Moonsea, Madoc spared no expense in hiring a well-known hero from the city of Daggerford for 10,000 gold pieces. The trip took them several days, and just within eyeshot from Voonlar, the caravan wagon lost its wheel, causing Madoc to fall into a rage. Thankfully, the repair was swift, and the caravan reached the city before a brewing storm hit the road. However, Anders, Madocs hand did not do diligence, and the wagon completely fell apart as the caravan entered Voonlar, barely reaching the Shield Trading Company. Predicting the dwarfs anger, Anders scampered away before being held responsible for the disastrous end of the journey.\nSoon after the entry, Madoc and the Hero of Daggerford were confronted by a member of Voonlars watch, demanding they leave the streets as soon as possible â€“ the city was under curfew under the orders of Bron Buorstag Hlammythyl. The Bron felt that the fiend armies summoned by the Order of the Crippled Fang were soon to attack Voonlar. After taking care of the merchandise, Madoc retired to his room in the Swords Meet inn, offering the Hero an opportunity for further employment.\nThe dwarf was reaching advanced years and hoped to retire and settle somewhere warmer and calmer than the Moonsea. To do just that, Madoc embezzled half the profits from a caravan to Sembia. His old allies, the Zhentarim, did not approve. By happenstance, Swords Meet was a dining spot for Bron Buorstag Hlammythyl, High Priest Gormstadd, and several Zhen agents when Madoc was staying in Voonlar. They noticed and confronted Madoc over the theft. The dwarf revealed his affiliation to the Hero of Daggerford and begged for his help. Despite the adventurers involvement, the Bron challenged the Hero to a duel over the head of his treacherous employer.\nOutside the Swords Meet, intoxicated brute Buorstag clashed with the Hero but was knocked out cold. Despite the agreement to spare the dwarfs life if the Hero emerged victorious, Gormstadd simply ordered Madocs execution, which swiftly ended his life."
