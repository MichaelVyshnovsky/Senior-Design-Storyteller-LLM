        "mainbody": "nariel was an individual who gave the elven longbow Taulmaril and a quiver of Anariel to Clan Battlehammer. She had the title \"Sister of Faer√ªn\".Though Catti-brie names her \"Lady Anariel\", it is not clear if she truly holds the title \"Lady\".\nAnariel once gifted the bow Taulmaril and a quiver of endless arrows to Clan Battlehammer at Mithril Hall.There is not yet any evidence that Anariel invented or created the quiver of Anariel, only that the one in Catti-bries possession is named for her. It may be that this is only a particular example of a quiver of plenty.\nIn 1356 DR, the Companions of the Hall explored the ruins of Mithril Hall and Regis discovered Taulmaril and the quiver in a crack in a stone wall. They gave both quiver and bow to Catti-brie, and she went on to use both in many battles.\nCategoryInhabitants\nptet4q23njziqtnmlhfk0lgzlcbyflq"
