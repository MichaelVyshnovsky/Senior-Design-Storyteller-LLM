Zora Rosealine Culkin () was a noble in Mulmaster.
Rosealine was a typical Mulmaster noble. She was polite but a bit impersonal, and striking to look at. Being very insightful, she could evaluate people after only a brief conversation. Rosealine was very suspicious. Despite all this, she felt a true responsibility for people living in her holdings, and she was horrified at the deaths that occurred.
Rosealine was part of one of the oldest noble families in the city, which had been part of the Lords Alliance for generations. She was a skilled wizard.
In 1491 DR, the Culkin-controlled village of Elmwood was totally destroyed by fire. Rosealine however discovered that there was a survivor and hired an adventuring party to retrieve her for questioning.
