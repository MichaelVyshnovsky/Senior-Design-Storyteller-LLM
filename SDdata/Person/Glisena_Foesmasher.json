        "mainbody": "Glisena Foesmasher was the daughter of Baron Aldorn Thuragar, ruler of Ormpetarr in Sespech, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nGlisena was a young woman considered to be somewhat plain, with a face too square to be pretty. However, she had a voluptuous figure.\nShe was naive, believing Naneths words and that Dmetrio Extaminos loved her.\nBy 1370 DR, Glisena was in a relationship with Dmetrio Extaminos, a yuan-ti pureblood and son of the ruler of Hlondeth, much to her fathers chagrin. Aldorn was afraid their progeny might have snake-like characteristics, even though Demetrio was outwardly human. He disrupted their courtship as much as he could without a serious effort, but came to understand it was futile.\nFinally, he seemed to be willing to let her marry him in order to improve the shaky relationship with Hlondeth. However, in the , she disappeared and several theories arose as to why she vanished. Her father thought she escaped, while his clerics thought she might have been kidnapped for ransom. After some investigations, she was found to have escaped to Chondalwood in order to save her unborn child, conceived with Dmetrio, from forced abortion.\nUnbeknownst to her, Naneth, who posed as a trusted midwife, offered her to escape through magical means.\nHer relationship with her father was strained due to her relationship with Dmetrio Extaminos. He loved her dearly, but was domineering and strict, forbidding her from seeing Dmetrio ever again after he learned of her pregnancy, listing yuan-ti as untrustworthy and backstabbing. He even ordered her pregnancy to be terminated in secret. However, he did not spare any resources to rescue her and try to save her life.\nShe was madly in love with Dmetrio, with whom she had a relationship. However, she failed to see how denigrating he was, and believed he would come to save her in Chondalwood and take her with him."
