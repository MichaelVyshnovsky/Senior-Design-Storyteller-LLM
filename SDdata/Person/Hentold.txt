'''Hentold''' was a grave robber who lived on the [[Sword Coast]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|I disturbed its lonely slumber with my foolishness! It haunts me and I get no rest in sleep!}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Hentold traveled to the [[Valley of the Tombs]] and broke into one of the crypts. He stole the ''[[Heart of the Golem]]'' from one of the tombs within, in the process awakening a [[revenant]] of the man once killed by the [[item enchantment|enchanted]] dagger. After his grave mistake, Hentold was unable to get restful sleep, believing he would only rest again with the return of the dagger.
