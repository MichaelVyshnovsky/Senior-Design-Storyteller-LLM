        "mainbody": "'''Yssaria''' was a merchant in [[Luskan]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Some time before [[1490 DR]], Yssaria received a package he did not order that contained a sentient mounted [[fish]], whom Yssaria came to call Teacher. Over the next few months, on the Teacher's instructions, Yssaria attempted to train a [[zombie]] called [[Joslin]], preparing the undead for possession by the Teacher. However, Yssaria was unsuccessful in his attempts at necromancy, and had to tie Joslin up in his upstairs bedroom because he was getting too violent."
