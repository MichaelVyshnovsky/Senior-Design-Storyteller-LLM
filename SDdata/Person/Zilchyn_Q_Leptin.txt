Zilchyn QLeptin, or simply Zilch, was a drow wizard from Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR.
Zilchyn was a kleptomaniac. This behavior increased with the arrival of the demon lord.
Circa 1486 DR, he stole some spell components and was discovered. He fled the city, losing his spellbook, and had an encounter with a black pudding that gave him many scars over the left part of his body. Zilchyn finally arrived in Mantol-Derith, where he hoped to begin a new life.
