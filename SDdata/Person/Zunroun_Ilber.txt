Zunroun Ilber was an archmage of Calimport in the early 8 century DR, and ten of the fourteen Magisters during the Night of Fourteen Magisters.
He was seen as "insanely ambitious".
He knew a spell akin to clone, and had the means at hand both to scry on the Magister and to mentally bind his clones to a task.
Illinge Hardraw was his student as of .
Zunrouns investigations prior to the Night of Fourteen Magisters uncovered that the Magister Almer Galarthund frequented the Vizier Vanquished tavern in northern Calimshan. On the night of Eleasis 4 in the , he confirmed Almers presence, and released twelve clones, under a compulsion to force them to attack Almer the effort of the spell made him pass out. The clones closed in on Almer, and attacked recklessly he managed to slay three of them before they took him down. They all immediately became the Magister, and were driven insane by the mental load, attacking each other to the death and bringing down the inn in the process. Before Zunroun regained consciousness, however, he was slain by his apprentine, Illinge Hardraw.
