        "mainbody": "Thold Ramaeras was a trader in fine wines in the town of Everlund, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. He was also a member of the Arcane Brotherhood.\nThold was always smiling. He had dark amber eyes, dark hair, and a handsome face. He was slender, but knew how to handle a weapon.\nRamaeras could sometimes be found in the Missing Minotaur tavern, a rough and rowdy establishment on the west side of Everlund. He was a wine merchant that did business around Everlund. This allowed him to perform services for the Arcane Brotherhood as well as gather information. He frequently sponsored young adventuring bands to explore sites in which he was interested, requiring them to report back to him on what they discovered."
