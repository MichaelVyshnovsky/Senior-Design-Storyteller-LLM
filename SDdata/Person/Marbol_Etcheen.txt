'''Marbol Etcheen''' was a master [[Chess (game)|chess]] player who ran [[Master Etcheen's Chess Shop]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was kind and truly adored the game of chess. He was always available for a game with a new customer, but was rarely, if ever, beaten.

==Activities==
Marbol crafted exquisite chess pieces, usually carved from wood, but also of [[ivory]] and [[marble]] as well. For the common-folk, he was known to create cheaper pieces of clay that he painted. Meanwhile, the nobles of Ravens Bluff often commissioned Master Etcheen to craft custom family sets that they displayed in their homes and would likely pass down as heirlooms from generation to generation.

==History==
Marbol was at one time a military advisor to King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]]. He also played chess with people all around [[Faerûn]]; he won a lot of games and won a lot of wealth, but gave much of it to charities in Ravens Bluff.

He was running Master Etcheen's Chess Shop by [[1370 DR]].
