He wore a neat green waistcoat, and stepped up on a short bench to reach the proper height while tending the bar.\nTrosken used to be an adventurer, but retired from it and became a tavernkeeper, seeing it as less risky and more profitable. The Ball and Chain became the first and only tavern to service the docks of the then-new Wheloon Prison"
