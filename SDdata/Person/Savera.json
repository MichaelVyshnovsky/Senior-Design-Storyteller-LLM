        "History": "Savera was one of the many handmaidens of [[Lolth]]. In 1372 DR, the goddess sent Savera to learn the secret of the [[Night Realm]] in order to teach them to the [[drow]]. Savera, posing as a male [[half-orc]] using her ''[[hat of disguise]]'' and with a retinue of [[taer]]s, infiltrated the mercenary army gathered by the [[nilshai]] sorcerer [[Tolg'byri]]. Thanks to her disguise, she took Tolg'byri by surprise, killing it.\n\nAfterward, Savera took control of the group and started searching inside the libraries of the citadel for the secrets wanted by Lolth. However, she could not find the portal key used by the nilshai and [[Mourel Duskwalker]]."
