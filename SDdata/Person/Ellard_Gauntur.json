        "mainbody": "Ellard Gauntur was a War Wizard in Suzail during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was young.\nThe young man was self-important, and zealous.\nThe self-important man was rather inexperienced.\nThe inexperienced man was assigned five Purple Dragons as his retinue for his last mission Ilstan Narbrace, Unstrarr Troon, Gorloun Hethel, Berent Thallowood and Mandron Saldar.\nAround 1479 DR, five Dragons acted as escorts for the War Wizard of Cormyr Ellard Gauntur in his pursuit of the renegade Rorskryn Mreldrake. They caught up to Rorskryn as he used a portal to Marsember, while in the shape of a woman Ellard Gauntur figured out that it was Rorskryn transformed from a stain on her clothes, and then got pushed by Ilstan Narbrace through the portal for his trouble.\nThen the evil vampire archmage Manshoon sent the death knight Targrael after them to hide Mreldrakes trail. Targrael found Hethel at the top of the Kings Tower in Marsember he was at the wizards armory, asking if Ilstan Narbrace, whom Targrael had just killed, had noticed anything amiss. She slashed his throat as he peeked his head out of the door."
