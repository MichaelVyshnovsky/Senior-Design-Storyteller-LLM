'''Duupox''' was a [[morkoth]] member of the [[Olleth|Arcanum of Olleth]] in [[Serôs]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Thanks to his skills, Duupox rose through the Arcanum's ranks until he became one of the apprentices of Arcount [[Axar Xyrl]].

During the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], Duupox participated in the Olleth raids on the [[Tower of Numos]] at [[Abydos]]. However, there he was defeated and scarred by the [[triton]] hero [[Keros]] the Wanderer.

In 1370 DR, Axar Xyrl allied with the [[aquatic elf]] tyrant [[Gantar Kraok]] and the arcount sent Duupox with Major [[Qyzal]] to organize am ambush against some surface dwellers who were enemies of Kraok.

Later, Axar Xyrl, together with Gantar Kraok, also entered the battle to help his subordinates. However, Gantar recklessly hurled spells that struck the morkoth and when Axar Xyrl and Duupox confronted the elf about it, Gantar insulted everyone in the place and [[teleport]]ed away. 

Therefore, in revenge, Axar offered an alliance to the surface dwellers.

==Personality==
Duupox was a greedy and opportunistic individual. After his skirmish with Keros, he became more ruthless. Duupox dreamed of one day having his revenge against Keros. Like all his fellows at Olleth, he wanted to uncover some hidden magic and use it to rule over all.
