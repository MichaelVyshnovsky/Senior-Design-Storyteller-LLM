She also worked alongside local merchant consortiums and craftspeople to enforce the monopolies of the merchant princes and ensure payment of taxes. In addition, she coordinated special orders from important clients, matching them to approved merchants or craftspeople.\nForeign merchants and craftspeople wanting to sell their wares in Port Nyanzaru were directed to speak with the Master of the Market, who could connect them to agents of the merchant prince who controlled the trade and sale of the relevant goods. For instance, alchemists and those dealing in alchemical supplies or potions might be directed to Giregi Igiri, while smiths and weapon merchants might be directed to Silaha Mnunzi.\nthumb|Tearah Initoo at the Bazaar in her role as Master of the Market.\nDuring the events of the death curse, Tearah received special orders from the likes of the wealthy heiress Teyileri Siwifi (seeking to buy a magnificent necklace), the guard captain Uponga Naodha (seeking to acquire foreign titansteel armor), the huntress Mirea Sain (seeking a leatherworker to make gear for the Hunters Guild of Chult), the artificer Chonigi Tomi (seeking objects touched by the Far Realm), and the foreign merchant Sofia Chiaroscuro (hoping to reclaim her confiscated goods)."
