'''Aburu''' was a [[camel]] living in [[Marigold's Menagerie]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Behavior==
Aburu was rather arrogant, had a foul temper, and would spit at whoever passed her by.

==History==
Before being moved to Marigold's Menagerie, Aburu worked as an animal performer at the [[Mooney & Sons Circus]]. Being such a hassle to take care of, [[Marigold Mufflefoot]] was in search of a trustworthy individual to take the camel back to the desert land she had originated from.
