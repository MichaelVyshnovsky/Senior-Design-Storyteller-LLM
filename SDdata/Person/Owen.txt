Owen was a young adventurer inhabiting the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Owen had green hair thanks to a magical alteration made to him by an enchanted necklace.
Owen carried around a bardiche, a dagger, a tent, and a set of scale mail.
He joined a group of adventurers called the Knights of the Sword Coast and was excited to earn riches.
Unbeknownst to Owen, the magical necklace that turned his hair green also gave him the astounding regenerative abilities of a troll.
