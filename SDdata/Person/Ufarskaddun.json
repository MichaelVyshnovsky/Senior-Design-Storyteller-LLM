        "mainbody": "'''Ufarskaddun''' was the leader of a band of 200 [[orog]]s that migrated from the [[Lowerdark]] to the [[Northdark]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], Ufarskaddun led his people upwards from the depths of [[Toril]], searching for a base from which they could strike out at the surface lands of [[Faer√ªn]]. During their journey, they came across the ruins of the [[dwarven]] city of [[Splendarrmornn]], the royal capital of ancient [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]]. They took over the ravaged dwarfhold, ridding the region of the [[undead]] and scattered [[fiend]]s.\n\nSome of their patrols came across [[tanarukk]]s, [[demon]]ic orcs, that unbeknownst to the orog chieftain, were part of the much larger [[Scoured Legion]] of [[Hellgate Keep]]. While he ordered the complete extinction of any remainders of the foul hybrids, he was unaware of the true strength of their [[Ammarindar|stronghold]]."
