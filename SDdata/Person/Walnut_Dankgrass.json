        "mainbody": "Walnut Dankgrass was an elven druid who served as documancer for the \"C\" Team of the adventuring company Acquisitions Incorporated.\nStrongly opposed to urban civilization, Walnut sought to undermine citied life from within. Distrustful of most people who did not mirror her matriarchal values, Walnut had a rigid conviction that her beliefs were right and true, and would see them through to the bitter end.\nShe was an accomplished druid, capable of assuming the wild shape of a dire wolf.\nShe wielded the magic scimitar Foremother in combat.\nWalnut was born into the Enclave Panax Anima in Kryptgarden Forest, an all-female clan dedicated to protecting the forest and serving Mielikki. It could not last, however Walnuts clan was destroyed by agents of \"civilization\", leaving her as one of the few survivors. Although possessed of an antipathy toward anything urban, Walnut eventually made her way to the city and was recruited into Acquisitions Incorporated as a documancer."
