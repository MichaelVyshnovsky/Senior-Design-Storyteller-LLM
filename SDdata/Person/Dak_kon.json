        "mainbody": "akkon was a githzerai fighter and mage who, following a crisis of faith, ended up becoming a servant of the Nameless One.\nDakkon was tall, thin, and clearly elderly in appearance, with his skin being dried and covered in scars. He was bald, and had a gray, long mustache and beard, the latter of which was braided. He wore plain, orange-colored clothing under simple, studded pieces of metal armor.\nHis years spent on the plane of Limbo among his people and then under servitude of the Nameless One made him a calm, stoic, and meditative individual who was slow to anger and rarely show his emotions. Despite this, deep inside he was deeply saddened and filled with terror over his involuntary service to the Nameless One.\nHis most cherished possession was the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon, a religious text containing the teachings of Zerthimon, which unbeknownst to him was manufactured by the Nameless One as a means to manipulate him into servitude.\nHis main weapon was his magical katana, which was given to him when he took the position of a zerth.\nLittle was known about his early life, but at some point he held the position of a zerth within the city of Shraktlor. Both the inhabitants and the town structure itself relied on his mental composure and wisdom to function and stay together. During this time, Dakkon experienced doubts about the teachings of Zerthimon and his mental composure faltered, which in turn led to the fall of the city.\nSometime after the the fall of Shraktlor, while wandering the chaotic plane of Limbo with his spirit crushed and himself wishing for death to come, he was rescued by an incarnation of the Nameless One. Githzerai tradition compelled Dakkon to enlist as his rescuers servant until the Nameless Ones death. However, Dakkon was oblivious to the fact that the Nameless One was in fact immortal, and thus condemned himself to eternal servitude.\nTo mend Dakkons spirit and make him a more useful minion, the Nameless One fabricated an artifact called the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon, a puzzle crafted from stone and composed of interconnected rings containing religious lore regarding the history of Zerthimon. The Nameless One kept the fact that he fabricated it himself secret from Dakkon, and presented it as a genuine githzerai relic. It was uncertain whether the texts within the artifact were genuine, but Dakkon found them authentic enough and they served their purpose. He dedicated himself to studying the wisdom within them during the time of his enthrallment.\nWhile following the Nameless One, Dakkon eventually ended up in the planar city of Sigil, and was thought to have perished sometime before  during a fight with a powerful being. Within the same year, his katana ended up in the possession of the Athkatlan merchant Deidre."
