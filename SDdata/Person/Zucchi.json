        "Personality": "Zucchi was bitter, unfriendly, unforgiving, and broadly immoral, making her a truly horrible woman. She had an extremely sharp mind in her old age, which combined with her extremely strong magical powers to make it too difficult for her many rivals to assassinate her. As a result, everyone was forced to endure her existence.",
        "Activities": "As part of her duties, she personally made the acquaintance of all new potential students that wished to apply to the school. She also personally taught classes alongside the body of teachers made up of [[Czarnieck]], [[Flaugergues]], [[Lycanter]], [[Siculus]], [[Addington]], [[Midoria]], [[Grenoble]], and [[Alexander (Netherese)|Alexander]]."
