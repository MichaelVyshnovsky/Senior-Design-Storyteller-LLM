'''Flaylan''' was a cowardly [[spear]]-wielding [[orc]] who served [[red dragon]] [[Firkraag]] in [[Firkraag's Maze|his maze]] in the [[Windspear Hills]] of [[Amn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Flaylan and [[Derg]] were found in the quarters next to the kitchens of Firkraag's Maze. When [[Abdel Adrian]] was lured into the dungeon, he and his companions confronted the duo of orcs. Flaylan and Derg begged for mercy and showed no aggression towards the [[Bhaalspawn]], claiming to had only been following their master's orders. It was unrecorded if the adventurers spared the duo of [[orc]]s, allowing them to the Windspear Hills.
