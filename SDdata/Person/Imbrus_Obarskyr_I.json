        "mainbody": "Imbrus I was the 38th Obarskyr monarch and a king of Cormyr. Like so many of his relatives, he was murdered by Gorauna. A common-born man named Rathdar Orlenthar ruled Cormyr as regent until Imbrus cousins or son would come of age. All three, however, died in the Purplethroat Plague, and an Obarskyr would not sit on the throne again until 341 DR."
