        "mainbody": "'''Algorind''' was a paladin of the [[Knights of Samular]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Algorind was a man who'd lost his way. His unquestioning willingness to follow superiors' orders had led him far from Tyr's path, although he remained a sincere, earnest, and dedicated man. Full of confusion, he asked for advice from [[Gareth Cormaeril]], who was secretly the man responsible for Algorind's troubles. Thus he followed without question the orders of his tormentor.",
        "History": "Algorind, starting out as a very zealous paladin, was for years deceived by Gareth into trying to fulfill many futile quests. Becoming Gareth's pawn, he had orders to avoid [[Bronwyn Caradoon]], who had worked for the opposing faction in the [[Thornhold]] affair."
