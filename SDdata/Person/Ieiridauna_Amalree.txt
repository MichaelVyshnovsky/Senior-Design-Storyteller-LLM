'''Ieiridauna Amalree''' was a [[half-elf]] woman of the 11{{th}} century [[DR]] who became a [[watchghost]], haunting [[Mirt's Mansion]] throughout the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ieiridauna appeared as a tall, slim woman with blue-black hair to her knees, and long, pale limbs. She wore a simple, tight yet flowing moonglow-colored gown. Her eyes were large, black, and full of tiny stars; she could make only parts of herself visible if she wanted to, and also she flowed without a sound, except when she needed to make noise.

==Personality==
After her death, Ieiridauna resented people living where her home used to be, but later came to accept [[Mirt]], [[Asper]], and their friends.

==Abilities==
Not a true watchghost, Ieiridauna could not use magic but she could trigger magical objects, slightly draining them in the process, and control the wards of the home to attack intruders.

==Activities==
During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Ieiridauna watched over Mirt's Mansion.

==Relationships==
Ieiridauna Amalree was the daughter of [[Phanturgost]] and [[Nathra]].

She was friends with Mirt and Asper, and quite friendly with their guests, most often including [[Elminster]], whose lifeforce she supped from sometimes.

The [[Chosen of Mystra]] all knew Ieiridauna as a helpful "creature of the [[Weave]]".

==History==
She lived with her parents as of the {{yearlinkName|1036}}, the year in which the two of them returned to their home, [[Thrauntspire]], from a [[Netherese]] ruin with eight [[sorcerer]]s from lands south of [[Calimshan]] as guests. During dinner, these sorcerers attacked as one, launching slaying [[spell]]s; her father died protecting the two of them during the battle, and her mother soon after. Ieiridauna tried to escape, reaching for her parents' stash of artifacts, but a stray spell caused an explosion upon coming into contact with them, and both her and the eight mages were annihilated.

She coalesced centuries later as a ghost and discovered that Mirt's Mansion was built where her home used to be, leaving only the cellars intact. Taking a quick disliking to Mirt, she tried to haunt him and scare him into leaving. Instead, on first sighting her, Mirt simply asked her what she'd like. She fled, reeling, only to find herself pursued and comforted by Mirt and Asper, his wife. They were friends ever since.

The watchghost fought off [[Evaereol Rathrane]] when the latter tried to stalk [[Laeral Silverhand]] in Mirt's Mansion late in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, making him flee, but not before the ghostly entity learned of the ''[[spellfire]]'' wielder, [[Shandril Shessair]]. Her scream was heard even by [[Paraster Montheir]], who was leaving Mirt's Mansion at the time.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|201-202|16}}

Ieiridauna Amalree greeted [[Elminster]] and reluctantly drank of his lifeforce in the {{yearlinkName|1373}} right before he met Mirt, with whom he discussed his upcoming investigation of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]].
