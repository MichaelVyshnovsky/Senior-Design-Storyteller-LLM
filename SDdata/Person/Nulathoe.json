        "mainbody": "ulathoe was a necromancer,\nMost famously, he created the necromantic spell known as Nulathoes ninemen, He was also credited with inventing the spells Nulathoes concussive demise, Nulathoes death ward, and Nulathoes undead army. Although he was a powerful necromancer, Nulathoes spells were generally too crude to aid in the preservation of complex organs.\nNulathoe authored many necromantic tomes,\nNulathoe had two apprentices, one of whom was the famous wizard and spell inventor Nchaser. After Nulathoes death, these two apprentices carried on his legacy by proliferating his most famous spell Nulathoes ninemen.\nNulathoe was sometimes mentioned alongside infamous liches like Acererak and Vecna as a testament to the corruptive nature of necromancy."
