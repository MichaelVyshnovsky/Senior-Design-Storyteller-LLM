'''Ransford''' was an apprentice [[mage]] that studied under [[Khelben Arunsun]] for a time during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was the youngest and most excitable of Khelben's pupils at the time. From Khelben's perspective he was prone to bothering his master with topics as frivolous as three-legged [[frog]]s.

==Activities==
While receiving his education in the [[arcane arts]] under the [[Blackstaff]], Ransford served him as a messenger and errand boy.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Ransford was forced to once again disturb Khelben along with Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] when High Lord [[Gervas Imesfor]] suddenly appeared before [[Blackstaff Tower]] fighting off a [[mind flayer]].
