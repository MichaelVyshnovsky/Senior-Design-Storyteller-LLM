Thesophul Wugg was a shopkeeper and transmuter in Skullport.
Thesophul managed a shop that provided adventurers who wanted to explore Undermountain with all they needed.
In 1370 DR, a great increase in returning, unsatisfied guests convinced Thesophul to hire a minotaur, Snogg Mudmane, as a guard, but unknown to Thesophul, he suffered from narcolepsy.
