Cyndra led the survivors of [[Brassune]] to the city of [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]], displacing its [[orc]] and [[half-orc]] inhabitants, and rebuilding the city into the new home of the displaced [[genasi]]. Cyndra also enacted laws and edicts that gained her the approval and support of the nobility, such as the ''Covenant of Stewardship'' and the office of the [[Four Stewards]]. It was considered that her rule was a renaissance of sorts for the genasi kingdom.\n\nQueen Cyndra died of illness in [[1469 DR]], and was succeeded as queen by her daughter, Arathane."
