Cyndra led the survivors of Brassune to the city of Airspur, displacing its orc and half-orc inhabitants, and rebuilding the city into the new home of the displaced genasi. Cyndra also enacted laws and edicts that gained her the approval and support of the nobility, such as the Covenant of Stewardship and the office of the Four Stewards. It was considered that her rule was a renaissance of sorts for the genasi kingdom.\nQueen Cyndra died of illness in 1469 DR, and was succeeded as queen by her daughter, Arathane."
