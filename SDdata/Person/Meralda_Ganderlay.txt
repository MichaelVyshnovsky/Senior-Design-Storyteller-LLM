'''Meralda Ganderlay''', also known as '''Meralda Auck''', was a [[human]] woman from the [[:Category:Fiefdoms|fiefdom]] of [[Auckney]] near the [[Spine of the World]]. 

==Relationships==
She was the daughter of [[Dohni Ganderlay|Dohni]] and [[Biaste Ganderlay]], who were farmers on the side of [[Maerlon Mountain]].

The young lord [[Feringal Auck]] fell in love with her. She eventually married him, but not before she conceiving a child ([[Colson]]) by [[Jaka Sculi]]. The child was adopted by [[Wulfgar]], despite (or perhaps due to) her having accused him of rape. Wulfgar returned Colson to her mother in Auckney after the death of his wife, [[Delly Curtie]].
