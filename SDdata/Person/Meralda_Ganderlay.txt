Meralda Ganderlay, also known as Meralda Auck, was a human woman from the fiefdom of Auckney near the Spine of the World. 
She was the daughter of Dohni and Biaste Ganderlay, who were farmers on the side of Maerlon Mountain.
The young lord Feringal Auck fell in love with her. She eventually married him, but not before she conceiving a child (Colson) by Jaka Sculi. The child was adopted by Wulfgar, despite (or perhaps due to) her having accused him of rape. Wulfgar returned Colson to her mother in Auckney after the death of his wife, Delly Curtie.
