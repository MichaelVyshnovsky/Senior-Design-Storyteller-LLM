        "mainbody": "sham-Ana was a dragonborn of Abeir, and the ancestor of Clan Yrjixtilex.\nEsham-Ana was a slave of the Empress Dragon Gauwervyndhal. He worked on the mines located on the outskirts of Skelkor, and secretly hunted game in Gauwervyndhals forest to provide food for his fellow slaves. When the Dragon Empress discovered that someone was hunting in her domains, she set her dragon vassals to search out the culprit. The bronze dragon Ororonymilith discovered that Esham-Ana was the thief and went to the mines to arrest him, but the other slaves rose in rebellion, killed Ororonymilith and fled from the mines.\nEventually, Esham-Ana became the posthumous patriarch of Clan Yrjixtilex."
