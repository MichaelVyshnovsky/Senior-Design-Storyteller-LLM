Ebenz Farbough was a farmer in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Ebenz and his wife Bea Farbough managed a farmhouse near Hillsfar. When the citys First Lord Torin Nomerthal proclaimed again the Great Law of Humanity, expelling all non-humans, Ebenz and Bea decided to house the ten abandoned children living in Madame Delilahs Home for Orphaned Children.
A year later, Bea gave birth to six sons, so things became even more chaotic.
Trouble arrived the year after, circa 1486 DR, when the tiefling boy Pynroth disappeared.
