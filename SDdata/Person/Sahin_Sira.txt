'''Sahin Sira''' was known as the Sheikh of the [[Great ghul|Great Ghuls]] in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==History==
Sira kidnapped [[Yasmin Sira|Yasmin]], a mortal [[hakima]], and made her his wife. She despised her husband and wanted nothing more than to hide from him and be left alone.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to legends among the [[jann]] and the [[Al-Badia]] nomads, Sahin Sira made for her the ''[[All-Knowing Eye of Yasmin Sira|All-Knowing Eye]]'', an  [[artifact]] of great vision, [[divination]], and detection, so that she might look upon the vastness of his domain and fall in love with him.
