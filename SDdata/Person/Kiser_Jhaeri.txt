'''Kiser Jhaeri''' was an infamous thief and assassin in [[Saradush]].

==History==
During [[The Five]]'s siege of Saradush, Kiser was ready to open the gates to the enemy. To cover up his plot, he framed an innocent, [[Mateo]], blackmailing the chief witness, [[Mirnielle Santele]], by kidnapping her son [[Ardic Santele]]. Eventually, [[Gorion's Ward]] became involved in the investigation, and at first Kiser proclaimed his innocence. After Gorion's Ward discovered the capture of Ardic, Kiser tried to frame the mage [[Errard]] for the kidnapping. At last, Gorion's Ward saw through Kiser's lies and he fought and defeated Kiser.

==Rumors==
Count [[Oon Santele]] and Mayor [[Tanithe Beyross]] had suspicions that Kiser was the secret leader of the [[Cat's Claw]] assassin guild.
