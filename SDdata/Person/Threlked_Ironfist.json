        "mainbody": "'''Threlked Ironfist''' was the king of [[Tuern]] in the midâ€”14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Threlked appeared somewhat grizzled, having grey hair and a bald upper head. He often wore his [[armor]] and held his [[sword]] in hand.",
        "Personality": "The High King was civil, but he was also gruff.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]], as well as several other adventuring groups, made their way to Tuern following vast rumors of [[meteorite]] ore being located on the volcanic island. King Threlked met with them, and warned the heroes that the many canyons across the isles were filled with very dangerous monsters."
