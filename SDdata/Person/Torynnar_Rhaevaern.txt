Torynnar Rhaevaern was a sun elf baelnorn wizard and archmage and one of the founders of the Eldreth Veluuthra.
By 1374 DR, he was the last surviving member of the original founders and was still amongst its ranks, as one of its leaders, the VelNikeryma. They asked for his wisdom on all important matters.
At the time, he suspected that the organization was suffering from an outside influence, particularly in the Cormanthor cells. He had last felt an influence of this power during the fall of Myth Drannor of 711 DR to 714 DR. However, he was unsure of the source and was reluctant to tell the full council about it until he was.
He laired in an ancient crypt in the heart of the Wood of Sharp Teeth, guarded by all manner of traps and magical defenses as well as Claugxinaurak, the venerable green dragon who served as his steed.
