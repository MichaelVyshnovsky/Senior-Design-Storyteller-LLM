Ramusio was a boring half-elf warrior inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Though he often went adventuring, nothing particularly exciting or dangerous ever happened to Ramusio. He decided to retire from the adventurers life and moved to Daggerford where he earned a living sweeping the streets. As fate would have it, he found this line of work far more exciting, especially when he found an enchanted ring one day.
He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located in between Kaoth Alley and Wall Street near the River Gate.
