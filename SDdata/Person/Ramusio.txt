'''Ramusio''' was a boring [[half-elf]] warrior inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Though he often went adventuring, nothing particularly exciting or dangerous ever happened to Ramusio. He decided to retire from the [[adventurer]]'s life and moved to Daggerford where he earned a living sweeping the streets. As fate would have it, he found this line of work far more exciting, especially when he found an enchanted [[ring]] one day.

He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located in between [[Kaoth Alley]] and [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] near the [[River Gate]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
