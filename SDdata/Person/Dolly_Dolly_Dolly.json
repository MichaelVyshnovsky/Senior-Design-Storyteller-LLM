Been trapped in that coffin with no one but a mad drider and my own farts for company.''|Dolly Dolly Dolly}}",
        "Description": "Dolly was a lavender-skinned miniature [[fey]] woman with rugged wings reminiscent of those of a [[dragonfly]]. She had lavender-purple shoulder-length hair and eyes. She whimsically spoke in a rhyme that dropped like an iron curtain the moment she lost her patience, became irritated, or angry.",
        "Abilities": "The pixie possessed magical radiance, amplified by her ''moonlantern'' cage, offering those bathed in the radiance full protection from [[Shadowfell]]'s and the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]]' corrupting magic.",
        "History": "[[File:Dolly dolly dolly's bell.png|thumb|''Dolly Dolly Dolly's filigreed [[Feywild]] bell.''|270x270px]]\nSometime in or shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Dolly Dolly Dolly was trapped inside a ''moonlantern'' devised by the [[necromancer]] member of the Absolute named [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]]. The ''moonlantern'' was believed to be a gift from the Absolute by its owner, the mad drider Kar'niss, who served the cult as a guide, taking [[True Soul]]s crossed the perils of the shadow-cursed lands. She remained alive but quiet while in the driders hands but would threaten and tease anyone else were they to claim the lantern, demanding a release. It was unknown if Dolly was ever released from her spiked cage, but she was ready to offer a ''filigreed [[Feywild]] bell'' to her rescuers, claiming that if the bell were shaken, her rescuers would receive \"what they've earned.\""
