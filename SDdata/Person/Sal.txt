Sal was a mule who lived in Ravens Bluff under the ownership of eccentric street vendor Friar Cookpot in the 14 century DR.
Sal had only a single eye and a bad case of fleas.
This mule wore a set of horseshoes of speed.
Sal had been taught a variety of things by Friar Cookpot. These included nuzzling up to customers in order to elicit sympathy, bowing on cue, and galloping away whenever trouble arose. Sal was also known to bray during Cookpots sales pitches in order to emphasize various portions of it.
