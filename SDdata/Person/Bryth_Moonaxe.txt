Bryth Moonaxe was a half-dwarf commander of the Knights of the Crescent Moon who arrived in Iltkazar in the year 1370 DR.
Bryth was a rare half-dwarf born from the Lady of the Seven Silver Stars, Elhanna Moonhawk, and First Axe Therlarn Axesong. He was born in  and was raised from birth to lead the Order of the Crescent Moon. He was too young to fight in the Eye Tyrant Wars but was active in all the subsequent conflicts, so when the time came, Bryth was unanimously elected as commander of the Order.
However, he found the Order in constant struggle with rival groups devoted to Selune and to Clangeddin and involved in the court politics of Tethyr and Iltkazar.
After the power of his order started to decline in , Bryth consulted the Oracle of the Deepwash. The Oracle gave him a prophecy that the Order would quickly disband but would also rise again in the future to fight an ancient foe. Therefore, Bryth and all his fellows voluntarily underwent a Phezults sleep of ages spell. 
They awoke in 1370 DR, 1,445 years later. Under the able leadership of Bryth, the members of the order slowly adapted to that time and tried to reforge the bond with the crown of Iltkazar. However, Bryth saw stagnation around him and spoke against it, while also asking for a war against the beholder Alimir Hive. 
Bryth was an individualist and a natural leader. He was usually blunt and disliked intrigues. Bryth was also extremely crafty and was able to use his intransigence to gain advantage in a negotiation or to deceive his opponents. After his bad experiences in the past, he usually distrusted anyone at first and was very slow to open himself to others. On the other hand, his word was absolute.
