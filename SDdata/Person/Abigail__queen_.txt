'''Abigail''' was wife of High King [[Carrig Cymrych III|Carrig III]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the late 5{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their son was [[Colin Cymrych]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|32}}

==History==
Abigail became High Queen of Moonshae when Carrig III inherited the throne in the {{YearlinkName|499}}, following the assassination of [[Tuathal Cymrych|his father]]. Carrig III was also assassinated just [[500 DR|a year later]], at which time Colin was only eight years old. Thus, Abigail named a regent, King [[Edmund Kincaid]] of [[Snowdown]], to rule [[Callidyrr]] until Colin was older. Colin would assume the throne in the {{YearlinkName|507}}.
