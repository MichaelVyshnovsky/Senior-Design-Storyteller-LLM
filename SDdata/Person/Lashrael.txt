'''Lashrael''' ({{Pronounce|LASH|ray|ehl|refs=

==Activities==
They were the primary servitors of Corellon, most commonly acting as his messengers on [[Toril]] but also defending mortal elves under threat.

==Description==
Lashrael and Felarathael were identical twins, with both appearing as tall, beautiful and androgynous elves of no particular race, with shining bodies and wearing gleaming white robes.

==Personality==
Despite being twins, the two had very different personalities. Lashrael was a being of extreme emotion. Lashrael spoke and delivered Corellon's messages with powerful conviction, deep sorrow, or tremendous joy, depending on the subject. He made dramatic gestures and his mood could change as quickly as the subject did. He was a fierce fighter who never asked for or gave quarter to an opponent.

==Abilities ==
In battle, rather than deal injury to a struck opponent, Felarathael and Lashrael could cause the victim to ''[[sleep]]'' without fail, suffer from amnesia, be [[polymorph]]ed into the form of a forest [[animal]], or be randomly [[teleport]]ed {{SIrange|1|10|mile|k|long=yes}} away.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1379}}, Lashrael and Felarathael went together to the [[Fugue Plane]] under the orders of Corellon Larethian to retrieve the soul of the slain [[drow]] [[Cavatina Xarann]], a [[Darksong Knight]] of [[Eilistraee]]. They explained to her that a few hundreds of the followers of Eilistraee had been turned back back to their original [[dark elf|dark elven]] form, and that Cavatina was among them, thanks to the sacrifice of [[Qilu√© Veladorn]]. Felarathael and Lashrael led her to [[Arvandor]], as they claimed that the transformed drow would be allowed into the elven [[afterlife]].

As of [[1479 DR]], some elven crusaders who revered Lashrael opposed the influence of the [[leShay]] of [[Sarifal]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|62}}
