Baatral was a fallen angel in the Labyrinth in the Northdark in the late 15 century DR.
The gods condemned Baatral and seven other fallen angels to remain as stone statues in the depths of the Labyrinth for unknown crimes.
Baatral tried to charm other beings in the vicinity and convince them to harm their companions.
