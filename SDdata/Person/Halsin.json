        "mainbody": "Halsin was the wood elf archdruid of the Emerald Grove on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR. He led his people in service to the Oak Father, Silvanus.\nHe had an imposing figure as a male wood elf, and was described as a \"bear of an elf\". He suspected his \"bearish\" figure was due to a half-orc ancestral link or some other species. He shared a face similar to his father, abeit unscarred. He received the scar on his face during an incident while he was shapeshifted as a bear—a she-bear in mating season had mistaken him and was offended by his discouragement.\nDespite his tenacity in combat, Halsin was a gentle, honest elf, and treasured the sanctity and beauty of nature. Though a powerful healer with a lofty title, Halsin was humble and patient, but willing to act with force if the need arisen. He was a strong leader who was highly respected among his fellow druids. He was polyamorous and he viewed carnal pleasures as a natural calling one of Halsins core beliefs was that desire should flourish wherever it found purchase.\nAs an experienced druid, Halsin was a skilled shapeshifter of the Circle of the Moon. He was capable of transforming himself into a mighty cave bear.\nHe was skilled in herbalism and potions as a healer. He also had skills in woodcarving.\nHalsin was served well by his fellow druid Rath, and several others. While the senior Kagha served as archdruid in his stead, she hardly shared Halsins outlook on leadership. He had an apprentice named Nettie.As a child, he became strongly bonded and a playmate with a nature spirit, Thaniel of the Western Heartlands. He realized his belief after age 110, coming-of-age, to be a serious protector of nature for his friend.\nHe was the last of his line, with the rest buried in the High Forest under the Grandfather Tree. From then on, he dedicated himself to the Emerald Grove as his family and to Silvanus as his teacher.\nthumb|Halsin in the late 15 century 316x316px\nIn his youth as a druid, Halsin foolhardily visited the Underdark to experience its otherworldly faunas beauty, but was captured by a drow matron mother and stayed in her House for three years as her imprisoned consort.\nIn the , on Uktar 6, Halsin sent two newer recruited druids north to help a village blighted with two years of failed crops. On Uktar 9, Halsin decided to pay a visit to a sudden Baldurs Gate group camping nearby the next day for harming nature that killed the cubs of a fox. Two bears and the fox already came to the Emerald Grove to alert the druid. On Uktar 10, Halsin tried to reason with the pioneering group, but they did not valued nature and wanted to farm the land and make a new city of their own so the druid had to make a creative move. By Uktar 12, Halsin secretly instigated a mudslide to bury half their farming equipment and made the rest useless. He also received reports of a Red Wizard to a village south, therefore, sent three rangers to investigate. If the target was true, he would contact the House of Silvanus for aid.\nSometime around the , Halsin came into conflict with Ketheric Thorm and the army of Dark Justiciars he had formed in the Underdark. While Halsins Emerald Grove and the allied Harpers commanded by Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun emerged victorious, the great druid could not prevent them bringing shadow upon the lands around the Moonrise Towers. His Archdruid was lost to the curse, and Halsin succeeded by leading the survivors away. His friend Thaniel, a nature spirit connected to the Western Heartlands wilderness near the Moonrise Towers, was also cursed by Ketheric.\nIn the , Halsin opened up his grove to a group of tieflings that had fled west from the city of Elturel as of Eleint 14.\nThat same year, accompanied by his apprentice healer Nettie, Halsin encountered a drow who had been infected with a mind flayer tadpole, but had yet to undergo the process of ceremorphosis. The pair returned to the Emerald Grove to conduct an examination of the non-ceremorphed drows corpse. Intrigued and worried about this, he began traveling west to the Moonrise Towers alone, meeting up with Aradin and his adventuring mercenary party along the way since Marpenoth 2. Unfortunately, by Uktar, Halsin was captured by the goblinoid members of the Cult of the Absolute, and imprisoned as a bear by goblins within the ruined Selûnite temple referred to as the Shattered Sanctum."
