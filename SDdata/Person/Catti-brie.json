        "Where's the babies' room?\n|Catti-brie, referring to killing newborns, after stating that she would have taken and used the blade herself\n}}\nDespite the old companions being reunited, Catti-brie's views and personality drastically changed, which was noted by each of her companions. From once caring about the different races of [[Faer√ªn]], and believing that even goblins should not be cut down until parlayed with, the reborn woman became extremely zealous. She began to strongly advocate genocide, even to the extent of slaughtering newborn babies. Catti-brie even stated that she would take the blade herself to kill young children and even infants. Despite various logical arguments from the other Companions of the Hall, such as notable examples of goodly [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s like [[Nojheim]], as well as factual evidence that orcs and dwarves coexisted for centuries in [[Baffenburg]], she would have none of it. She even directly contradicted herself, first yielding that there may be exceptions to goodly goblinoids, to then stating that there were not, directly afterwards. Her lover, Drizzt Do'Urden, compared her radical attitude to those of the wicked [[matron mother]]s of [[Menzoberranzan]].": "==Reunited===",
        "mainbody": "e Companions, reunited, traveled to [[Gauntlgrym]] to release [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] from his curse of [[vampire|vampirism]]. Along the way, they stopped in Longsaddle, where the Harpells gave her a scroll and a blood-red sapphire ring to serve as a [[phylactery]] to trap Pwent's soul. However, Catti-brie instead used the ring to entrap the [[lich]] [[Ebonsoul]]'s soul, forcing her to later capture Pwent in Wulfgar's [[horn of summoning]]. In Gauntlgrym, the Companions learned about the entrapment of Artemis Entreri, [[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]], [[Afafrenfere]], and [[Dahlia Sin'felle]]. The Companions aided the first three in escaping, but Catti-brie was forced to collapse a tunnel on Dahlia in the battle between the proxy of [[Lolth]] (Dahlia) versus the proxy of Mielikki (Catti-brie). The Companions believed Dahlia dead.\n\nThe Companions then headed back to Longsaddle, where the Harpells released Pwent, although his soul remained in the horn of summoning. They headed out for Mithral Hall, but stopped in [[Nesme]] to take a stand against [[orc]] and [[goblin]] attacks involved with the [[Darkening]]. Catti-brie used her formidable magic, both arcane offensive and defensive spells, as well as healing magic, during the siege. The Companions left after a time; soon after, Nesme fell to the horde.",
        "Description": "Catti-brie was beautiful, auburn-haired, and blue-eyed. \n\nWhen Catti-brie was struck by the [[blue fire]] of the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], it gave her a [[spellscar]] in the distinctive form of an [[hourglass]], the lower half of which was nearly filled while the top half had only a small sliver of bruising.\n\nIn her second life, despite her new heritage, the reincarnated Catti-brie appeared much the same as in her first body: she had thick, light brown hair with red highlights and blue eyes. She also had a spellscar on each arm: a seven-pointed star on a circle of red on her left forearm (the symbol of [[Mystra]]) and a [[unicorn]]'s head on her right forearm (the symbol of [[Mielikki]]). After the [[Weave]] began to return, her spellscars turned red.\n\nIn [[1483 DR]], Catti-brie wore a long, white, flowing dress that looked like one she wore in [[Iruladoon]]. She had commissioned it in the [[Shade Enclave]]. She often wore it with a black shawl.",
        "Personality": "Catti-brie was kind, tolerant, and pragmatic. Moreover, she grew into the role of emotional compass for her adventuring companions, guiding both Drizzt and Wulfgar (prior to his time in [[Errtu]]'s clutches) into wise action with her common sense and clear insight.{{fact}}\n\nIn her second life, Catti-brie was very confident and trusting in her goddess, Mielikki, to the point that she was so strongly anti-orc that it made Drizzt somewhat uncomfortable.",
        "History": {
            "Early Life": "Catti-brie's mother died while giving birth to her,In ''[[Sojourn]]'', Cattie-brie is 11 years old and the novel is dated to 1347 DR, implying she was born c. 1336 DR. However, ''[[A Reader's Guide to R. A. Salvatore's the Legend of Drizzt]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Drizzt Visual Dictionary]]'' both say she is born in 1339. This is more likely to be the date of the goblin attack. and subsequently her father moved with her from [[Mirabar]] to [[Termalaine]] in the [[Ten Towns]].<ref group=\"note\">In ''Sojourn'', Cattie-brie is 11 years old, and has been with Bruenor for more than seven years, implying she was 3 or 4 years old at the time and placing the raid around 1339 DR.<ref group=\"note\">''Sojourn'' mentions \"parents\" in the plural, while the \"''The Lone Drow'': Companions of the Hall\" article says her mother died in childbirth. It may be that Catti-brie's father remarried or that Bruenor is unaware and assumes both her parents were killed. which was turned away by [[Clan Battlehammer]]'s dwarves, led by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], who found the young Catti-brie and decided to adopt her as his own child.\n\nShe was the first to befriend Drizzt when he arrived in [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}},<ref> when she was aged 11. She took a great personal risk to warn Drizzt about the presence of the bounty hunter [[Roddy McGristle]]. The bounty hunter captured her, but Drizzt saved her, defeating Roddy in battle. Her good opinion of Drizzt and this event were instrumental in persuading Bruenor of Drizzt's good intentions, leading the dwarf to push Roddy away from the Dale on pain of death. She also befriended [[Wulfgar]] when the young [[barbarian]] was indentured to Bruenor from [[1351 DR]] to [[1356 DR]] after the [[Reghedmen]] attack led by [[Heafstaag]].",
            "Teens": "As a girl in her mid teens, Catti-brie was at Regis' house in Bryn Shander with two dwarves after [[Cassius]] had told her that Regis was to have his possessions removed. She and the dwarves were there to undertake the task but they were attacked by the [[assassin]] [[Artemis Entreri]] who was pursuing the halfling because he'd stolen a [[ruby pendant]] from Entreri's employer, [[Pasha Pook]] of [[Calimport]]. He killed both the dwarves and tied her to a chair, interrogating her and then setting off after Regis with her in tow. Catti was terrified of the wiry killer, fearing she would never be able to stand against the assassin, and even when she wasn't bound by him, she was so apprehensive that she did exactly as he told her. However, she also developed a grudging respect for him because he never used his obvious power over her to do anything other than make her follow him and answer questions. After traveling as his captive, she managed to free herself of her fear of him over a long period. Eventually, Catti-brie managed to persuade [[Jierdan]], a mercenary companion of Entreri's, to create the distraction she needed to escape her captor and rejoin her father & friends. She succeeded in freeing herself from him, taking a tumble down a rocky outcropping and running to Bruenor just outside Mithril Hall which the group had only recently rediscovered.{{fact}} \n\nShe was crushed when she saw Bruenor apparently fall to his death in [[Mithral Hall]] but overjoyed when it became apparent that he'd survived, despite the fact that Regis had been kidnapped by Entreri shortly after she'd escaped him. She and her father joined up with Drizzt and Wulfgar on the way to rescue Regis just in time to help save them from a pirate attack.{{Fact}}\n\nThe companions journeyed to [[Calimshan]], where they successfully defeated [[Pook]]'s forces, whereupon Regis took over Pook's guild, and returned to Mithral Hall, where the occupying [[duergar]] were defeated and Bruenor crowned king. During this time, Catti-Brie and Wulfgar had fallen in love. After her father's coronation, the couple planned to be wed but Wulfgar's desire for them both to live up to his tribal traditions became increasingly stifling to Catti-brie and she began to have second thoughts. In [[1357 DR]], drow from Drizzt's home city of [[Menzoberranzan]] attacked Mithral Hall, and, during the fighting, Wulfgar was apparently killed by a rockfall.{{Fact}}\n\nShe followed Drizzt when he journeyed back to Menzoberranzan in a suicidal attempt to stop another attack on Mithral Hall but was eventually captured by [[Jarlaxle]], who had taken a fancy to her. Jarlaxle then manipulated Cattie-brie and Artemis Entreri into working together to rescue Drizzt from being tortured and the three warriors barely escaped the city in time to warn the dwarves of the impending drow invasion. Catti had also picked up the sentient sword ''Khazid'hea'', which enhanced her melee combat abilities.{{Fact}}\n\nIn preparation for the imminent drow invasion, Catti-brie defeated [[Berkthgar]] in single combat to ensure the loyalty of Wulfgar's kin in [[Settlestone]] then, after being temporarily possessed by ''Khazid'hea'', beat it in a battle of wills. Catti and Drizzt avoided developing their burgeoning romance, deciding to remain friends because of her fiancee Wulfgar's recent death and Drizzt's own insecurities. The drow invaded shortly after, pitting the entire army of Menzoberranzan against an alliance of surface forces and [[svirfneblin]] from [[Blingdenstone]]. The drow were defeated and, bored with a life stuck in the tunnels of Mithral Hall thereafter, Catti-brie and Drizzt exercised their wanderlust by becoming famous pirate hunters on the [[Sea of Swords]] as part of the crew of the ''[[Sea Sprite]]''.{{Fact}}",
            "Adulthood": "The two spent six years adventuring at sea until they were called back to Icewind Dale, where Wulfgar was returned alive by the [[balor]] [[Errtu]]. Wulfgar had been tortured for the entire time that his friends thought him dead and his mental state was too fragile for him to stay with his former wife-to-be, especially since her image had been used so frequently as part of the torture. He ended up striking her and, ashamed, fled south, away from his former comrades.{{Fact}}\n\nInstead of following him, Catti-brie and her remaining friends let Wulfgar go, and instead took ''[[Crenshinibon]]'' to be destroyed, unknowingly placing it into the hands of Jarlaxle. They then started on a quest to locate Wulfgar when symbols of his hammer, ''[[Aegis-fang]]'', started showing up branded on outlaws. Wulfgar, also looking for ''Aegis-fang'', reconnected with his old companions but with a new wife and adopted baby daughter in tow.{{Fact}}\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], Bruenor returned to Mithral Hall to once again be crowned its king, taking his friends with him. While scouting north east of Mithral Hall, Catti-brie snuck up on a pair of orcs at a campfire east of [[Shallows]] before realizing it was an ambush. She was outnumbered heavily and succumbed to the stones, spears, and other weapons used against her, but not before slaying a number of the orcs. She thought that she was going to die, but was rescued by Wulfgar who single-handedly eliminated most of the rest of the orcs, causing the remainder to flee.\n\nHer leg was badly injured after a giant-thrown boulder crushed it and [[cleric]]s found it difficult to fully heal the injury. Cattie-brie never fully recovered from the wounds her leg suffered and her combat performance was hampered by it, even though she was able to walk again.{{Fact}}",
            "Wizard training": "In [[1372 DR]], during an assault led by [[Grguch]], chieftain of [[Clan Karuck]], on a wall and bridge under construction by [[Silverymoon|Silvaeren]] wizards led by [[Alustriel Silverhand]] herself, Alustriel loaned Catti-brie a ring and a wand and told her the command words for them. In testing that she could say the words correctly, she accidentally created a ''[[magic missile]]''; fortunately, the wizards were occupied by the orcs, so no-one saw that she'd unintentionally caused the wand to fire. Having been used to using her bow or her sword, she felt as if she'd be more of a burden in the fighting, that is, until she used the powerful ring she'd received from Alustriel. She quickly became more familiar with the power and was able to loose a series of fireballs that exploded, incinerating many orcs. With her leg hampering her warrior training and ''Khazid'hea'' now being wielded by the drow [[Tos'un Armgo]], Cattie-brie decided to take Alustriel up on her offer of training as a wizard, becoming one of Alustriel's apprentices in Silverymoon.",
            "Spellplague": "In the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], Catti-brie was struck by a strand of the falling [[Weave]] (part of the [[Spellplague]]) during her meditations and got caught between two planes of existence: the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Her body remained on [[Toril]], but her mind was caught between the Shadowfell and reliving her life. Drizzt took her to Mithral Hall where eventually Bruenor and Drizzt decided to take her to Cadderly with the help of Jarlaxle and a disguised [[Athrogate]]. Drizzt, Bruenor, Jarlaxle, and Athrogate teamed up and escorted her comatose form through to [[Spirit Soaring]]. Once they arrived, they faced the threat of a [[dracolich]], the [[Ghost King]], which was, in fact, a manifestation of the dragon [[Hephaestus]], combined with both the illithid [[Yharaskrik]] and the spirit of [[Crenshinibon]], the Crystal Shard. Although through Cadderly's sacrifice, the Ghost King was sealed away, no solutions to Catti-Brie's deadly trance were found. The quest ended in sadness several days later when Catti-brie's spirit was pulled out by the goddess Mielikki, but it could not be returned to the world of the living in her state. She was granted one last night with her beloved Drizzt.\n\nCatti-brie's and Regis's bodies were buried in two side-by-side cairns in Mithral Hall.\n\nAfterward, her spirit, along with that of Regis, were taken away to a [[Catti-brie's forest|private heaven]] created by Mielikki: a small pocket dimension containing little more than a forest, some hills, a glade, and a pond, that was part of, yet separate from, Toril, but based partly off the memory of the Companions of the Hall of a world before the Spellplague. Catti-brie danced and sang continually within the forest and it was hinted that she became closely linked to the dimension and was in fact the spirit protector of all within, while Regis was simply a guest. It was unclear as to whether the strand of the Weave within her yet remained.",
            "Reincarnation as Ruqiah": "{{main|Ruqiah}}\nAfter decades (although it appeared as mere [[tenday]]s to her) learning the song (magic) of [[Mielikki]] in [[Iruladoon]], Mielikki gave Catti-brie and the other [[Companions of the Hall]] (minus Drizzt) the choice of proceeding to their professed gods' home planes or being reincarnated as a mortal newborn of the same race and sex as their first mortal form.  All the companions chose rebirth with the understanding that they were to train themselves and meet at Kelvin's Cairn in [[1484 DR]] to aid Drizzt.\n\nCatti-brie was reborn on the spring equinox ([[Ches 19]]) in [[1463 DR]] as a [[Desai]] [[Bedine]] girl named [[Ruqiah]] in the [[Anauroch]] desert near the [[Shade Enclave]].{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle|1205}}\n\nIn [[1469 DR]], she came to the attention of the powerful Netherese witch Lady [[Avelyere]] who kidnapped Ruqiah and took her to the Shade Enclave to study magic.{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle|2698}} Ruqiah became homesick for her parents and Lady Avelyere gave her special permission to visit her parents once a tenday. During these visits her mother would teach Ruqiah arcane spells.{{Fact}}\n\nThe Netherese had suspected that Ruqiah was Mielikki's Chosen for some time but it wasn't until Lady Avelyere charmed Ruqiah that they confirmed their suspicions. Ruqiah discovered that Avelyere knew her secret, faked her own death, and fled the Shade Enclave for the [[Silver Marches]].",
            "Interlude": "After fleeing [[Netheril]], Catti-brie spent several years ([[1479 DR]] to late [[1482 DR]]) under the alias of '''[[Delly Curtie]]''' studying magic with the [[Harpell]] family of [[Longsaddle]] after her arcane magic failed her (an indication of the return of the [[Weave]]). When she learned that Avelyere was close to finding her location, she made her way to Icewind Dale in late 1482 DR, settling in [[Bremen]] and waiting for her friends to return. She retained her alias and had agreements to provide her services to several innkeepers and others in the area, such as [[Darby Snide]] at the [[Knuckleheader]] tavern in Bremen. She learned of Regis's arrival in [[Lonelywood]] and helped save him from ruffians from [[Ship Rethnor]].\n\nAt the appointed time‚Äîthe spring equinox of [[1484 DR]]‚ÄîCatti-brie and Regis ventured up Kelvin's Cairn and found Drizzt, mortally wounded, and at the same time Bruenor showed up on the scene. By the grace of Mielikki, Catti-brie was able to heal Drizzt. Wulfgar also appeared, and so the Companions of the Hall were reunited once again.",
            "New Outlook": "{{quote\n|Where's the babies' room?\n|Catti-brie, referring to killing newborns, after stating that she would have taken and used the blade herself\n}}\nDespite the old companions being reunited, Catti-brie's views and personality drastically changed, which was noted by each of her companions.

        },
        "Skills": "In her first life, Catti-brie was a skilled archer. However, in her second life, due to having no practice, she struggled with the bow and arrow, much preferring magic.\n\nIn her second life, from a young age, Catti-brie was able to cast both [[divine magic|divine]] and [[arcane magic|arcane]] spells. She was able to use healing magic from Mielikki from the age of five. She was well-versed in both new and old arcane magic, She also had an affinity for [[druid|druidic]] magic, including the spell ''[[call lightning]]''. Until her shapeshifting left her upon the return of the Weave in [[1479 DR]], she was able to shapeshift into the following forms: [[wolf]], [[owl]], [[hawk]], and [[eagle]].",
        "Possessions": "Catti-brie was armed with the bow ''[[Taulmaril]]'' and the sentient sword ''[[Khazid'hea]]'': As of [[1372 DR]], Drizzt used ''Taulmaril'' more often than Catti-Brie did.{{cite book/The Orc King/MMP|394}}\n\nAfter acquiring ''Khazid'hea'' from the corpse of [[Dantrag Baenre]], Catti-brie spent some time trying to control its rebellious consciousness. The sword was a sentient artifact that wished to be wielded by the best fighter in the land. With Dantrag being defeated in battle by Drizzt, it assumed the shape of a unicorn on its pommel to lure the renegade drow with the image of his deity. Catti-brie assumed ownership instead, and the sword managed to compel her to try and force herself upon Drizzt as a manifestation of the ''Khazid'hea''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s desire. She emerged from the battle of wills weary, but totally in command of the sword, even being able to change its sentience to good.{{Fact}} She never allowed it to control her movements and could block out the weapon's telepathy with nary a thought, though, towards the end of the battle with the orcs for control of Mithral Hall, the blade did take control over her, but only through the fact that she was near exhaustion. Years later, the sword was taken from her while she was asleep in her quarters in Mithral Hall. She feared for the wielder knowing how powerful the sword's sentience could be.\n\nShe also possessed a magical ''[[Cat's Eye circlet]]'' that allowed her to see her surroundings in a light as bright as in a moonlit night. It was given to her by [[Fret]] courtesy of Alustriel Silverhand of Silverymoon. \n\nAfter she began her training as a wizard, she wore the robes of [[Jack the Gnome]].{{cite book/The Orc King/MMP|394}} She also adorned herself with a small dagger, an assortment of wands, and a pair of powerfully enchanted rings, one of which she claimed could bring the stars themselves down from the sky.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Drizzt gave Catti-brie the magical ruby ring band he had retrieved from [[Brack'thal Xorlarrin]]. She discovered that the ring was attuned to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]: it protected her from flame, She later accidentally summoned a [[fire elemental]] with the ring.",

Their differing lifespans, with the short-lived nature of humans compared to the long lives of [[elves]], was also of concern to her.{{fact}} However, they were happily married for eight years before her death, and upon her reincarnation she and Drizzt married once more with Catti-brie becoming pregnant with their first child sometime afterwards.{{fact}}\n\nThe birth of Drizzt and Catti-brie's daughter [[Briennelle Zaharina]]‚Äînamed for both of her grandfathers, Bruenor and Zaknafein‚Äîduring the war between all the houses of Menzoberranzan around and beneath Gauntlgrym in 1488 DR was truly magical. The child had auburn hair, like her mother, and her eye color was like her father's, except a deeper, jewel-toned purple.

Seeing that Wulfgar was not the man she had once known, however, her feelings remained cloudy and ultimately they remained friends.{{fact}} \n\nCatti-brie had been doubtful about the marriage before Wulfgar was thought dead, as his pride and protectiveness over Catti-brie were beginning to take their toll on their relationship. Furthermore, her adventuring spirit was not ready for his barbarian lifestyle where wives are not held in high regard and were not permitted to go on adventures, stifling her free will, which she hated, and continued to adventure regardless.{{fact}}"
