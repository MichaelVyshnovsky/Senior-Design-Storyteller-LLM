Drullister was a phaerimm and the leader of a small hive in Synod in 1375 DR.
Drullister and its hive gathered in Synod to study the strange sharn formed from Augathra the Mad, a fellow phaerimm, and Shar Cormrael.
After 1372 DR, Hadrhune discovered the location and the very strange mythallar located there. Unknown to anyone, Hadrhune decided to make a deal with Drullister instead of fighting and agreed to teach it shadow magic in exchange for free access to study the mythallar. In 1375, however, an adventuring party raided the ruins in order to disrupt the shadovars plots.
