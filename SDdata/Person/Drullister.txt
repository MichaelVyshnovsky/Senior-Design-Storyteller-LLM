'''Drullister''' was a [[phaerimm]] and the leader of a small hive in [[Synod]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
Drullister and its hive gathered in Synod to study the strange [[sharn]] formed from [[Augathra the Mad]], a fellow phaerimm, and [[Shar Cormrael]].

After [[1372 DR]], [[Hadrhune]] discovered the location and the very strange [[mythallar]] located there. Unknown to anyone, Hadrhune decided to make a deal with Drullister instead of fighting and agreed to teach it [[shadow magic]] in exchange for free access to study the mythallar. In [[1375]], however, an adventuring party raided the ruins in order to disrupt the [[shadovar]]'s plots.
