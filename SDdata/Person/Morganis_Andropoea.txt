'''Morganis Andropoea''' was a [[medusa]] shopkeeper in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Morganis lived with her husband [[Holmyrr]] until, in [[1340 DR]], an adventuring party ambushed them and killed Holmyrr. Morganis managed to escape to Skullport, where she started a shop selling the statues she created. Morganis usually bought slaves at the [[Slavers' Market]] and petrified them, ready to be sold.
