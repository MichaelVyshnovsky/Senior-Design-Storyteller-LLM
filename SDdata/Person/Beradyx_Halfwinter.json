        "mainbody": "'''Beradyx Halfwinter''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and transportation mage for the [[Aurora's Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter]] in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Called a \"fat and lazy lackspell wizard\" by [[Elminster]] and other mages, who were contemptuous of his lack of power in [[the Art]], Beradyx preferred a life of \"spellhurling for hire\" in the safety and comfort of a city. He cast spells only for legal and non-combat purposes. In particular, he used the ''[[teleport]]'' spell to transport goods to the Aurora's Realms Shop.",
        "Personality": "He loved fine [[wine]]s and [[ale]]s and [[cheese]], which showed in his waistline.",
        "History": "When he visited the shop in the mid-1360s DR, [[Volothamp Geddarm]] was unable to learn Beradyx's identity."
