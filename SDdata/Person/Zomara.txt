Zomara was a drow cleric working with the slaver ring undercover in the Oasis of the White Palm in Raurin in the .
Zomara rested in a room underneath the Sandvoyagers Guild, inside a ruin known as the Temple of Set. She had a weighed net at the entrance, and kept eight spiders as servants.
Zomara had a mace, chain mail, and a small shield all of these were very powerfully enchanted. She wore boots of elvenkind and a cloak of elvenkind, which eased her avoidance of fire-based attacks. All of her equipment would become useless if exposed to sunlight.
Inside her pillow, Zomara kept ten gems, each of which was worth 50 gold pieces, five gems worth 100 gp, and one gem worth 5000 gp.
