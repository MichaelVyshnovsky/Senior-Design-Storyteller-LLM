{{Quote|I might lay down my life in your service, Luse my Princess. I might do it for Cormyr. I might do it for your father the King. But I’d be doing without even thinking about it if your mother so much as looked beseechingly at me.|[[Androvram Braerwinter]], regarding Queen Fee.}}

==Description==
Filfaeril had ice-blue eyes and silky, golden blonde hair, like honey, which reached her waist. Her figure was slender and she had pale skin. with a symmetric face, high cheekbones, and an upper lip that had the shape of a [[bow]]. 

According to one courtier of Cormyr she possessed a look that was sharper than any dagger.

Filfaeril stood at {{SIAdj|5.5|ft|adj=tall}}. 

==Personality==
The was a brilliant and intuitive individual who always voiced her opinion. She was not overbearing, maintained the regal grace befitting her role in the Cormyrean court. She demonstrated heroic patience throughout her years, a trait that stood in contrast to her oft-contentious husband and daughter [[Alusair Obarskyr|Alusiar]].

While Filfaeril had a strong will of her own, she tended towards introspection during her youth. She often thought long about what she wanted most, and discreetly made subtle actions and minor manipulations to fulfill those wants.

==Relationships==
She had two older sisters [[Avraele Selazair|Avraele]] and [[Narlneeme Selazair|Narlneeme]].

Filfaeril's husband was King Azoun IV. Azoun was drawn to her more for her extremely sharp mind rather than her beauty, and trusted her as his truest confidant and discerning advisor. It was said Azoun kept no secrets from his queen; they were entirely open about their individual lovers, and partners they would share together. Kin

===Allies===
Queen Filfaeril had a personal advisory relationship with [[Khelben Arunsun]] of [[Waterdeep]]. She often sought his council on matters of the spellcasters of the north, in secrecy from any scrying wizard that might be spying on her, including [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], the Royal Wizard. She communicated with Blackstaff via a cracked overgrown enchanted [[lion]] statue in the [[Royal Gardens]].

She enjoyed true and loyal relationships with several of Cormyr's Lady Lords, including [[Myrmeen Lhal]] of [[Arabel]] and [[Tessaril Winter]] of [[Eveningstar]].

Filfaeril founded a small secretive band of loyal agents, known as her [[Queen Filfaeril's Blades|Blades]]. These agents helped conduct her more informal diplomatic missions, which often involved working alongside fellow Harpers, including some of [[Mystra]]'s [[chosen]]. The queen's Blades remained willing to slay and die in her memory after her death.

==Abilities==
Fee was an exceptional rider and serviceable archer. Her true skill was demonstrated by her prowess wielding a [[sword]] and [[dagger]] in melee combat, or using [[throwing knives]] when facing foes at range.

==Possessions==
Filfaeril wore a ''[[Royal Cormyrian signet ring]]'' which allowed the Royal Magician of Cormyr, Vangerdahast, to know her location and communicate with her via telepathy.

The Queen owned an enchanted amulet that protected her from the ''[[scrying]]'' spell and similar magical  ways of spying on someone.

Filfaeril carried a silver-mounted body flask and a razer-sharp hairpin enchanted with [[death magic]].

==Activities==
Unbeknownst to her husband, Filfaeril was involved with the [[Harpers]] and acted as an agent on their behalf in Cormyr, regularly meeting with [[Dove Falconhand]].

She was skilled at [[Chess (game)|chess]] and was a published writer. Her [[book]], ''[[Thoughts from a Throne]]'', was first put to print in [[1379 DR]].

==History==
Filfaeril was born Filfaeril Selazair on Mirtul 4, [[1311 DR]], the last member of House [[Selazair]], a minor noble Cormyrean family. Her father was none other than [[Elminster]], the famous [[sage]] of [[Shadowdale]].<ref> Fee was a small child who was especially intelligent for her age, one that would be considered an "old soul". In her youth, Fee was personally tutored in numerous disciplines, including riding, martial combat, military tactics, and strategic gaming.

For a time she ran the family's beer business, while also conducting business with the Harpers. It was during that time that she first attracted the attention of Azoun. He knew early in their courtship that Filfaeril was the life partner he had sought for some time.

Although Filfaeril bore Azoun a son, [[Foril Obarskyr]] on [[Mirtul 1]], [[1332 DR]], the prince was assassinated by the [[Fire Knives]] on [[Uktar 11]], [[1334 DR]]. This was an event that the Queen never fully recovered from.

When Azoun was brought near death by the [[abraxus incident]] in [[1369 DR]], it was rumored that Filfaeril was so stricken with grief that she was taken away to the [[Spires of the Morning]] in [[Eveningstar]]. This was not true, as she had withdrawn to the [[Castle Obarskyr#Places of interest|Hidden Chambers]] in the royal palace in [[Suzail]]. A flight of [[flying dagger]]s and [[helmed horror]]s was unleashed into the private apartment in Eveningstar where the queen was supposed to be staying, killing four [[Purple Dragon knight]]s and under priests guarding the [[war wizard]]ess who was posing as the queen.

Filfaeril assumed the appearance of merchant's wife [[Aglarra Galdekund]] in order to hide in [[Waterdeep]] during the [[abraxus affair]]. The change in mannerisms and voice was blamed on an illness, that the couple had to travel to [[Iritue's Firesprings]] in southern [[Amn]] in order to address. Filfaeril's appearance at that time was changed to become short and masculine, with a pot belly and a large, pimpled chin.

During the rule of her daughter, Alusair the Steel Regent, Queen Fee remained in court and offered her skills as a diplomat to best aide the Forest Kingdom. Queen Filfaeril remained the 'true' ruler of Cormyr for a period of five years, from [[1379 DR|1379]] to [[1384 DR]], ending with the birth of her grandson, [[Azoun Obarskyr V]]. Filfaeril enjoyed complete and well-deserved authority in court as monarch, while Alusair as regent was seen as the "hero" among of the realm.

==Rumors & Legends==
The dark mage [[Manshoon]] once commissioned a lewd [[chapbook]] entitled ''[[Filfaeril Bound and Willing]]'' in an attempt to publicly shame and discredit Queen Fee's reputation.
