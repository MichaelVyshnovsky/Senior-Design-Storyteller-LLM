Othlo Phaerdinzer was the patriarch of the Phaerdinzer clan as of the late mid-14 century DR.
Othlo and his wife knew to scry on other wealthy people, the "Faceless, Heartless Ones" and invest accordingly. With that money, they supported the ventures of the other Phaerdinzers.
They enjoyed floating naked everywhere in their manor.
A retired shopkeeper, Othlo dwelt in Tallstones, his manor, with his wife, Jasurra Phaerdinzer.
