Brakkis Elspaar was a member of the Stone-Cold Reavers, a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.
The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold. However, Cryovain hadnt amassed any treasure yet.
Brakkis was out of shape and had lost the benefits of youth.
He took advantage of any opportunities presented to him, resorting to thievery when honest work was unavailable. He was a follower rather than a leader. This suited him because all he really wanted to think and talk about were dogs and what he would do when he retired.
