'''Loy Ho-dun''' was a [[kensai]] adventurer in [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
Loy Ho-dun had a great natural talent for swordsmanship. He studied more than twelve different styles and mastered two before developing his own personal style, the [[Dragon Swarm]].

Afterward, Ho-dun opened his school in the hills north of [[Shangtou]] in the [[Ch'ing Tung]] province to teach Dragon Swarm style, and students begged to enroll. However, he was often away, duel against other kensai in order to learn more.

In [[1358 DR]], Ho-dun decided to attend the [[Komite]].
