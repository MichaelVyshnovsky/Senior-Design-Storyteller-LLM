{{quote|''No, even I can see you're not defenseless. Human, arent you? Or something like it? I like humans - most of them anyway.''|Preybelish}}

==Description==
Preybelish was a {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} long dark sage whose longed coiling body was adorned by numerous necklaces, amulets, and periapts, his entire collection.

==Personality==
Preybelish was not overly aggressive, his main passion was obsessive amulet collecting, and the dark naga was willing to negotiate with warm-bloods to expand the collection. Nevertheless, Preybelish did not tolerate insults and retaliated against anyone who dared to insult the naga.

Preybelish did not like to talk about himself and claimed that his story was a tragic one. The dark naga seemingly preferred brooding in the darkness contemplating his mistakes, and passing adventurers with precious necklaces were his glimmer of joy.

==Abilities==
Like other dark nagas, Preybelish was a powerful opponent. The creature was fiercely intelligent and an adept spellcaster. Preybelish also had the ability to spit poison. The dark naga was immune to ''poison'' and resistant to ''charm''.

Preybelish possessed an uncanny ability to read his opponents' thoughts, often using the gift cunningly against the naga's enemies.

==Possessions==
Preybelish's amulet collection consisted of a ''+5 [[necklace of protection]]'',  a ''+2 [[amulet of protection]]'', a ''1+ [[amulet of protection from paralysis]]'', and a ''[[medallion of defense]]''.

==History==
In 1369 DR, the group of adventurers sent by [[Elminster]] to stop the ''Pools of Radiance'' resurgence in [[Myth Drannor]] was warned of Preybelish by [[Faeril]] and the healer [[Beriand]] sheltering on the ruins' surface. The dark naga was sheltering in the Dwarven Dungeons, on what used to be the [[Avenue of Smiths]] behind a magically sealed door. The creature's lair was filled with magical ''[[darkness]]'' that served to disorient possible enemies.

Preybelish was looking to acquire magical amulets that were scattered around the Dwarven Dungeons, namely a ''[[bloodstone amulet]]'', ''[[Onglore's amulet of war]]'', ''[[Theodore's token of luck]]'', and ''[[Tyr's locket of justice]]''.
