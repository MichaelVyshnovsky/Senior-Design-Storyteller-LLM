        "History": "In [[224 DR]], in the kingdom of Athalantar, Undarl killed [[Elthryn Aumar]], the lord of the village of [[Heldon]] and a prince of Athalantar, and his wife [[Amrythale]], but missed the Elthryn' son Elminster. This allowed Undarl to join the [[Magelord]]s.\n\nIn later years, Undarl rose in the magelord's hierarchy and finally become the Royal Mage. However, in [[240 DR]], Elminster, by now a powerful [[wizard]], started an insurrection against the magelords. All were killed and at last in a difficult confrontation, Elminster slew Undarl.",
