        "mainbody": "Undarl, also known as Undarl Dragonrider, was a male malaugrym wizard who posed as one of the most powerful magelords of Athalantar and was killed by Elminster Aumar.\nIn 224 DR, in the kingdom of Athalantar, Undarl killed Elthryn Aumar, the lord of the village of Heldon and a prince of Athalantar, and his wife Amrythale, but missed the Elthryn son Elminster. This allowed Undarl to join the Magelords.\nIn later years, Undarl rose in the magelords hierarchy and finally become the Royal Mage. However, in 240 DR, Elminster, by now a powerful wizard, started an insurrection against the magelords. All were killed and at last in a difficult confrontation, Elminster slew Undarl.\nUndarl usually rode his black dragon Anglathammaroth.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryMalaugrym\nCategoryMagelords\nCategoryInhabitants of the Shadowfell\nCategoryInhabitants of Athalantar\nCategoryInhabitants of the Western Heartlands\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nddh8erd0if2gq2x1x5c5b97a6q5lcnp"
