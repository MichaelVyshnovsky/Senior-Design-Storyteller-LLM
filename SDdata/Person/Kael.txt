'''Kael''' was the [[half-drow]] son of the [[alu-fiend]] [[Aliisza]] and [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] conceived during the [[War of the Spider Queen]], but was born on [[Mount Celestia]]. He was a knight and [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] since the late 14<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]].

==Description==
Kael had dusky gray skin, short white hair, an "aquiline face," and garnet-colored eyes.

Aliisza thought that he had "Pharaun's smug smirk."

==Personality==
Kael's personality was generally that of a calm, silent, and dedicated servant of the House of the Triad. His "quarter-demon" heritage sometimes overcame him when challenged or mocked, leading him to showing a sort of tempered rage. His loyalty to Torm came from his upbringing and having convinced himself not to question the gods, only to serve.

==History==
Aliisza conceived Kael at the end of [[1372 DR]] or the beginning of [[1373 DR]] during her dalliances with Pharaun Mizzrym in and around [[Menzoberranzan]]. However, she was not aware of the pregnancy for quite a while, and when she was made aware, she believed the child was that of [[Kaanyr Vhok]]. Vhok, aware of the pregnancy (but not that the child wasn't his), arranged for Aliisza to be captured by [[angel]]s and taken to the [[Celestial planes|celestial plane]] the [[House of the Triad]] to be judged for his future plan. Kael was then born there while Aliisza's mind was imprisoned elsewhere. The young Kael was mentored by the [[Tyr|Tyrran]] [[astral deva]] [[Tauran]], but the half-drow became a [[paladin]] fo [[Torm]].

When Kael first saw his mother, many years had passed. Seeing each other ended a ''[[geas]]'' that had been cast on Aliisza by [[Zasian Menz]] and forced Aliisza and Kael to switch bodies. Aliisza, in Kael's body, went to open a portal to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] for Vhok and was "lost" for more than a decade inside the maw of a [[storm dragon]]. Kael, in his mother's body, was able to use her innate abilities to make her body appear as himself and continue his life. When Aliisza was released from the storm dragon, Kael was able to feel her and locate her; presumably about this time their bodies were switched back. 

Kael joined Tauran, Aliisza, and Vhok in searching for Zasian, who had brought the power of [[Cyric]] into the celestial plane. They failed to stop Cyric from stealing [[Azuth]]'s [[Old Staff|staff]] and killing [[Mystra]] in [[1385 DR]], an event that shook the planes and created the [[Spellplague]]. Along with the others, Kael ended up in a chunk of the [[Blood Rift]], where Aliisza summoned the soul of Kael's father to fill the soulless body of Zasian. His time spent with both his mother and father was short, however; he was eventually captured by the Court of Tyr and sentenced to receive a new tutor and have his custody transferred to another follower of Torm. However, a demon attack on the House prevented the change and Kael went with Tauran and Aliisza to prevent Vhok from reaching the [[Lifespring]]. On the shores of the Lifespring he witnessed his mentor slain by Vhok, saw his father killed to protect him from magical backlash, and held his mother in his arms as she died from the Spellplague.

After losing his new-found family, Kael no longer felt like he belonged in the House of the Triad, so he headed out on his own to find himself. 

==Possessions==
Kael wore [[Plate mail|''plate armor'']] and wielded a [[Greatsword|''greatsword'']]. He owned a pair of [[Winged boots|''winged boots'']] that enabled him to fly. Upon her death, Aliisza gave him Pharaun's ring of [[Sorcere]], thick and silver with spidery emblems engraved in its surface. which enabled the bearer to ''[[detect magic]]''.

==Relationships==
===Tauran===
The [[astral deva]] [[Tauran]] was Kael's mentor and friend, serving as a father-figure to him. Kael greatly mourned his death.

===Aliisza===
Kael originally detested his mother, [[Aliisza]]. However, as they got to know each other, they each came to care deeply for each other. Through their switch, Kael experienced a hidden female life for more than a decade. Her death promoted Kael to journey on a path of self-discovery.

=== Pharaun Mizzrym ===
Kael had no knowledge of his biological father. Pharaun temporarily resurrected in the Living Vessel Zasian with Allisza's help during the early stage of the [[Spellplague]], but was later destroyed by a [[dragon]]-[[hobgoblin]]-[[deva]] abomination [[Micus]].
