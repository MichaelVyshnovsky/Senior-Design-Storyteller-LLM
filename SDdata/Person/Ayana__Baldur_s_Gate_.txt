'''Ayana''' was a child of [[Fiona]] who lived in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Ayana died in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, and her body was buried in the [[Lower City Graveyard]]. Fiona, the child's mother, could not thank the mortician [[Valmorba]] enough for going above and beyond for the funeral in a letter and sent the [[Lower City Mortuary]] [[gold]] for the coffin and for Valmorba to bury the girl's beloved [[teddy bear]] with her.
