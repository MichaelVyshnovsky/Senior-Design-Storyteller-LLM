'''Maram il Vass''' was a powerful [[ultroloth]] in the [[Deep Wastes]] n the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|16}}

==Activities==
Maram had found a better approach than warmongering. Instead, he developed a refuge on the [[Prime Material Plane]] from which to trade his goods and his secrets.{{Cite adventurers league/It's All in the Blood|18}}

==Personality==
Maram was cunning and had a painstaking attention to detail, yet was extremely charming, a trait he knew how to use.

==History==
Maram was once an ultroloth living in [[Gehenna]]. At one point, he worked for the [[demon lord]] [[Graz'zt]] in the [[Outer Planes]], distinguishing himself in his service, and the two separated on good terms.

However, after becoming bored of war, Maram constructed a refuge in the Deep Wastes in [[Toril]]'s [[Underdark]]. There, he worked to expand his collections of exotic things and beings.

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], with the arrival of Graz'zt in the Underdark, Maram renewed his partnership with the demon lord. At the same time, he used this connection to add to his collection. Queen [[Hledh Hellspawn]] of [[Maerimydra]] granted him the [[drow]] alchemist [[Xaven Tanor'this]] of [[Szith Morcane]].

Later, an adventuring party hired by [[Murssvayas Dhuurniv]] went to Maram's lair to free Xaven.
