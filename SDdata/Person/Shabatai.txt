Shabatai was a wizard, belonging to the Far Quey tribe of the Nar in the .
Taegan Nightwind described him as small and sharp-featured, while Will Turnstone called him sharp-nosed and a runt. He carried a polished ebony rod with gold caps at the ends, which he employed to cast a spell that created an entrancing radiance of many colors, presumably hypnotic pattern.
On Eleint 7, he broke the spell that Karasendrieth used to approach his war band, and then attacked her with burning hands. After her companions offered aid to the warriors injured in the fight against Capnolithyl and thus ended the battle, he tried to orient them in their quest for the dracorage mythal, but knew of nothing that could aid them. It was another warrior amongst them that suggested they try asking The Hermit, which he initially dismissed.
