'''Muriel''' was a [[monk]] at the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]].

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Muriel and some other monks were kidnapped by cultists of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], who planned to use them in a new plot to access an [[elemental node]]. In a room of the node's complex under the monastery, she met an adventuring party hired by Grandmaster [[Perrywinkle Shin]] to find the missing monks. The adventurers saved her from poison gas.
