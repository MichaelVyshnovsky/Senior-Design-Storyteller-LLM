Kurishi Otobe, known as the Dragon Lady, was a human wizard and a member of the Council of Captains of the city of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Kurishi was cloaked in mystery. Even during most meetings with business partners, she tended to remain hidden in the shadows.
Kurishi was a speculator and moneylender. She also purchased exotic goods and sold them later for profit. Dozens of loyal followers worked for her, most of them rogues.
The Dragon Lady was a rival to the Underbaron Ozamata Ku Murawa, another of the members of the Council of Captains.
