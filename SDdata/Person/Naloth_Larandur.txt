Naloth Larandur was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.
He was tall and expresionless.
He could cast spells, including a long-arm spell that opened doors from a distance.
Together with other War Wizards, Naloth was in the basements of Castle Obarskyr, under orders from Ganrahast to scour them in the aftermath of the killing of five sages. While searching, he came across a beholder, which attacked him and the group they counterattacked, and in so doing triggered a trap that brought down the ceiling atop them. There were no survivors.
