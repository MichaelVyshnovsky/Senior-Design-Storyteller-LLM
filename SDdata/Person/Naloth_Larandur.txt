'''Naloth Larandur''' was a [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
He was tall and expresionless.

==Abilities==
He could cast spells, including a ''[[long-arm]]'' spell that opened doors from a distance.

==History==
Together with other [[War Wizards]], Naloth was in the basements of [[Castle Obarskyr]], under orders from [[Ganrahast]] to scour them in the aftermath of the killing of five sages. While searching, he came across a [[beholder]], which attacked him and the group; they counterattacked, and in so doing triggered a trap that brought down the ceiling atop them. There were no survivors.
