'''Yazka''' was a [[kobold]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].

Yazka and [[Kipper]] were the lieutenants of [[Urko]] during their attack on [[Hilltop]] in [[1372 DR]], on a mission from [[Tymofarrar]].

Yazka preferred peaceful solutions to battle, and was therefore taunted by Kipper as a coward and "girl kobold."<ref>
