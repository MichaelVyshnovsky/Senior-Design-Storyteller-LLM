Sallyanne Corks was a female drow inhabitant of the city of Baldurs Gate in late 15 century DR.
In the , Sallyanne Corks and five other Lolthsword drow women were targeted and eventually murdered by Orin the Red, a Bhaalspawn member of the Murder Tribunal that hid its ugly carcass under the streets of Baldurs Gate. In her depraved commitment to Bhaal, the deity of murder, Orin hunted down individuals who came to represent other Bhaalspawn, who pressed a century earlier in the Bhaalspawn crisis, in this case â€“ the drow Bhaalspawn Sendai. Sallyanne and the other drow were turned into gory dark effigies to the Lord of Murder in the cave basement of the groundkeeper of the Bloomridge Park in the Lower City.
