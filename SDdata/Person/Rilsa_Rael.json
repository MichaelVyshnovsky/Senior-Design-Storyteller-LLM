Needle held great respect for Rilsa and her dedication to the Baldurian's of the Outer City.",
        "History": "{{Quote|In another time and another palce, RIlsa Rael would be celebrated as a revolutionary. In Baldur's Gate, in her own lifetime, she's known as a crime lord...|'\"Excerpt from [[The Guild: Hidden Rulers of Baldur's Gate]].''}}\n[[File:Rilsa Rael CLB.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Rilsa Rael of Little Calimshan, c. [[1492 DR]].]]\nWhen she was young, Rilsa's father was hung by soldiers of the Flaming Fist, and her mother became a courtesan to an influential member of the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|Baldurian nobility]]. Rilsa was left alone in the world when her mother was later imprisoned by her lover's spurned wife. To survive, the young Rilsa joined one of the street gangs in [[Baldur's Gate/Norchapel|Norchapel]].\n\nDuring her rise to power, Rilsa Rael fully brought Little Calimshan under the influence of [[the Guild]]. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, Rilsa was involved in the crisis that culminated in the resurrection of [[Bhaal]].\n\nRilsa still held onto power over the the course of the following decade. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}} however, the [[Right Pashas]], a Calishite gang based in Little Calimshan, saw the Guild as an outsider group and fought to force the Guild out of what they saw as their territory. When the Guild entered a turf war against the [[Stone Lord]], a fierce warrior under the control of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Rilsa Rael broke peace with the Pashas of Little Calimshan, after of of their leaders proclaimed Nine-Fingers' reign was over. The man claimed to know what the Guildmaster was thinking and how her downfall was inevitable. Rilsa Rael retaliated by cutting his finger off and mailing it to Nine-Fingers along with the note on what had happened. But Rilsa was sure that the headman of the Pashas now knew Nine-Fingers' mind a little better."
