Fatima Kossi was a halfling who lived in the Pilgrims District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Fatima owned the Wanderers Rest, catering to pilgrims visiting Huzuz. She often let true pilgrims stay for free if they could not afford her rates.
Fatima was a devout follower of Kor. She felt like she wasted much of her life in pursuit of money when she could have spent that time productively as a priestess.
Though long retired, Fatima used to be an adventurer.
