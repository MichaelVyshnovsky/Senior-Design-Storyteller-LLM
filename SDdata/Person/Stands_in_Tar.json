        "mainbody": "'''Stands in Tar''' was the [[tabaxi]] captain of the ''[[Dancing Delight]]'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Stands in Tar was a joyful but somewhat quirky tabaxi. She had a reputation for being reckless, yet also for making the impossible possible. Stands in Tar was a hard-drinking alcoholic.",
        "Activities": "Stands in Tar routinely cruised the [[Sea of Swords]], hauling goods for merchants as well as passengers. Her sailing ship, the ''Dancing Delight'', was fast and highly maneuverable. Her crew was small and trained not to gossip about their missions.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1491 DR]], [[Valdi Estapaar]], who was a member of the [[Leilon]] town council, was looking to hire a ship to transport a group of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to the [[Thunder Cliff Caves]]. The caves at the foot of the [[Thunder Cliffs]] were used as a hideout by the [[Cult of Talos]], which had previously attacked Leilon, and were only accessible by sea. Stands in Tar competed with [[Kristoffen]], the [[dragonborn]] captain of the ''[[Ice Floe]]'', for the job. Though the Thundercliffs were considered dangerous, Stands in Tar was undeterred. The adventurers then cleared the caves of the threats there."
