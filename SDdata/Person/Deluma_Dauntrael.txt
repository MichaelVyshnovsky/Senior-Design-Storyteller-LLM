Deluma Dauntrael was the matriarch of the Dauntrael clan as of the late mid-14 century DR.
She grew fruit in her gardens as a hobby, often using spells that altered light or heat.
Deluma spent much time improving her understanding of the Weave, achieving a level of fine control over her spells akin to that of a Magister. She could have eventually crafted a Cormathan spell-web, had she meant to.
