        "mainbody": "Janssen was a retired bard inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThough not quite a sage, Janssen was a valuable source of information regarding anything about the High Forest region. He could usually be found at the Lady Luck Tavern, raising his drink and boisterously starting a new round of song.\nHe lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford on Wall Street near the barracks."
