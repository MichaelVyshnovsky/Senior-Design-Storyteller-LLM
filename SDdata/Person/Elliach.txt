Elliach was an insane mage inside the Wandering Emporium, which traveled across the plains of Avernus in the Nine Hells in the late 15 century DR.
Elliach was on the run from debt collectors when he met Mahadi. Fascinated by him, he paid the collectors and invited Elliach to remain inside the Emporium.
Elliach collected and sold demon ichor, which he used in various experiments.
Most people believed Elliach to be insane.
The demon ichor had warped Elliach in two aspects his arms had become two tentacles with fingers at the end, and his ears grew wings and flew away, so Elliach was deaf.
