Falhnen Battlescar was a fighter and a cleric from the town of Longsaddle, active in the 14 century DR.
Falhnen hailed from the small town of Longsaddle, just outside Neverwinter Wood. He was a lowly descendant of peasants, who, in turn, were descendants of slaves who settled in the Savage Frontier. Despite his low social standing, by the age of twenty-one, Falhnen Battlescar fell in love with Rachel Del Goldwhite, a princess daughter of a local noble family. Her father swore to kill Falhnen if he ever crossed the noblemans line of sight. This was the drive behind Falhnen Battlescars adventuring career. He sought to gain money and status to change the mind of Rachels father.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, Falhnen Battlescar was among the ambitious fortune seekers who were interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.
