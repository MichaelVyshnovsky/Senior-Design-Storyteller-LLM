Pescatawav was a mind flayer and the coordinator of the elder brain hive mind in 1488 DR.
Pescatawav was selected in 1488 DR to be central link of the hive mind.
Kimmuriel Oblodra expressed to it his doubts about its fellow mind flayer Ouwoonivisc, who somehow acted in dissonance with the hive mind. Working together, Pescatawav and Kimmuriel discovered that Ouwoonivisc had been infected by Lolth and was unwillingly disturbing the hive mind. Kimmuriel, with the support of Pescatawav, destroyed Ouwoonivisc.
