        "mainbody": "Grit was a half-dwarf half-orc rogue of Clan Ironeater residing in Illefarn around 1480 DR.\nGrit was the son of the dwarfÂ Thord Ironaxe, who was one of the few dwarves to fall in love with an orc, Tulug. Grit did not much like his parents, especially his mother.\nAround 1480 DR, the Red Wizard of Thay Arvik Zaltos asked for volunteers for a mission outside. Grit proposed himself, immediately followed by his father Thord.\nSo Arvik instructed Thord Ironaxe, his son Grit, and the ogrillon Lump to go to Daggerford to help his apprentice Darwa Dalion to recover the earth key from inside the Ambergul Crypt.\nHowever, when Darwa, Thord, and the others found the altar to Ogremoch, she tried to unlock the earth key by force and a magical trap turned her into stone.\nSo Thord went back together with Grit and Lump, but Thord was captured by some minotaurs who wanted cook and eat him.\nOnly Lump and Grit returned to Illefarn with the earth key.\nAfter giving the key to the Red Wizards, Grit went to his room to listen to a singing stone he had recently found at Laughing Hollow.\nGrit basically hated everyone in his life he did not consider himself like other half-orcs because it was like looking in a mirror, he disliked the orcs that wanted him to become a fighter, and disliked the dwarves because they tried to expel the orcs from Illefarn. Grit dreamed of leaving Illefarn and seeing the world."
