'''Elizar Dryflagon''' was a high-ranking member of the [[Cult of the Elemental Flame]] at the [[Scarlet Moon Hall]].

==Description==
An older male human, Elizar customarily wore robes. 

==Possessions==
Elizar wielded a ''[[Dagger]] +1'' and carried a pipe through which he could summon four [[smoke mephit]]s.

==History==
Elizar was once a druid until he turned to the worship of [[Imix]]. Soon he became one of the leaders of the Eternal Flame.

In [[1491 DR]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis, Elizar and his minions, posing as the obscure (and fictitious) [[Circle of the Scarlet Moon]] druid circle, set up camp at Scarlet Moon Hall and called for help in performing the [[Rite of the Wicker Giant]] in order to restore the balance of nature in the troubled region, or so he claimed.

At last, Elizar was confronted and defeated by some adventurers.
