Rolan was a wizard apprentice from Elturel that was arranged to study under the esteemed mage Lorroakan of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.
Rolan had two black horns that gently curved back and up.
Not one without ambition, Rolan sought to be the "greatest wizard" in all of Faer√ªn.
He had no family by blood relation but had a close bond with fellow tieflings Lia and Cal. While insecure about whether they truly felt the same, he considered them his siblings. 
As of the , Rolans apprenticeship with Lorroakan was set to begin. Unfortunately, his home city of Elturel was pulled down into Avernus in the Nine Hells. While this proved only a temporary impediment to his higher education in the arcane arts, the expulsion of all tieflings from Elturel was much more problematic. Rolan was waylaid for some time alongside the other tieflings traveling to Baldurs Gate under the leadership of Zevlor and forced to take shelter at the Emerald Grove, further delaying his inevitable rise as the preeminent spellcaster of the Realms.
Following a goblinoid attack on the Emerald Grove, Rolan got into an argument with Lia about whether or not they should help defend the druids grove to flee for Baldurs Gate while they still had the opportunity.
