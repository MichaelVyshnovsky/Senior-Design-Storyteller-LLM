'''Rolan''' was a [[wizard]] apprentice from [[Elturel]] that was arranged to study under the esteemed mage [[Lorroakan]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Of course he is! The greatest spellcaster along the [[Sword Coast]]. As if I'd settle for a lesser mentor.|Rolan, speaking about his future instructor [[Lorroakan]].}}

==Description==
Rolan had two black horns that gently curved back and up.

==Personality==
Not one without ambition, Rolan sought to be the "greatest wizard" in all of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Relationships==
He had no family by blood relation but had a close bond with fellow tieflings [[Lia]] and [[Cal]]. While insecure about whether they truly felt the same, he considered them his siblings. 

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Rolan's apprenticeship with Lorroakan was set to begin. Unfortunately, his home city of [[Elturel]] was [[the Descent|pulled down]] into [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]]. While this proved only a temporary impediment to his higher education in the [[arcane arts]], the expulsion of all tieflings from [[Elturel]] was much more problematic. Rolan was waylaid for some time alongside the other tieflings traveling to [[Baldur's Gate]] under the leadership of [[Zevlor]] and forced to take shelter at the [[Emerald Grove]], further delaying his inevitable rise as the preeminent spellcaster of the Realms.

Following a [[goblin]]oid attack on the Emerald Grove, Rolan got into an argument with Lia about whether or not they should help defend the [[druid]]'s grove to flee for Baldur's Gate while they still had the opportunity.
