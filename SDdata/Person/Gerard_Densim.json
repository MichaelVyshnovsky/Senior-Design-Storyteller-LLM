        "mainbody": "'''Gerard Densim''' was the proprietor of [[Fine Fabrics]] shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|''Our fair patriars rely on my business to keep them properly attired to face the many complexities that come with governing our city, particularly in times such as these.''|Gerard Densim}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gerard Densim did business with the criminal organization of [[Baldur's Gate/Little Calimshan|Little Calimshan]] â€“ [[the Guild]]. He paid for the organization's thugs to stand guard over the shop, protecting it from the dreaded [[Stone Lord]], a new kingpin allied with the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. As the guild war grew more severe, The Guild Bursar [[Uktar (The Guild)|Uktar]] raised the protection tithes. If unpaid, the guard would be withdrawn from Fine Fabrics. Gerard wrote a politely pleading letter stating he could not afford the guard to be removed and asked if it would be a good compromise for the Guild to accept a letter of credit from Fine Fabrics in addition to a twenty-percent discount for the Guild's guard (so they could look presentable while standing guard) and a fifty-percent discount to the guildmaster [[Nine-Fingers Keene]], the city's fifth and unforgotten duke."
