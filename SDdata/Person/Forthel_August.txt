'''Forthel August''' was a [[bard]] who was known for offering significant sums of gold to [[adventurer]]s and crafting songs about their exploits during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He refused to travel and experience the world on his own, owing to the inherent danger that could be encountered on the road.

==History==
Forthel became a bard for the easy nature of the work and the inherent impressiveness and prestige that accompanied the profession, particularly among the wealthy and [[Upper City]] women of Baldur's Gate.

In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Forthel encountered [[Gorion's Ward]] and their party. He offered them 200 [[gp]] for a story, about which he could write a song to woo the women he so desperately sought.
