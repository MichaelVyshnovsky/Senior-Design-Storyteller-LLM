        "mainbody": "Red was a leprechaun wizard on a quest for gold, active in the 14 century DR.\nEven though an accomplished wizard, Reds new form crippled his arcane skills, leaving all his spells almost impossible to cast, at a whooping one percent chance of successes.\nRed had a small collection of wondrous items on hand, such as a pot of holding for his gold, a wand of wonder, and a spool of everlasting thread.\nAt some point in his life, Red was polymorphed into a leprechaun. Even though he was much smaller, and his magic grew largely unreliable, he preferred the new form to his old human one. When encountered, most people noticed that Red loved color red, evident by his clothes, and hated green, very much unlike other leprechauns. In his new form, he embarked on a quest for treasure, to fill his seemingly bottomless pot of holding with gold, in hopes that that pursuit was to grant him the true magical powers of the tiny fey folk."
