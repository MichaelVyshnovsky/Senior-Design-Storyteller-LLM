        "Abilities": "Even though an accomplished wizard, Red's new form crippled his arcane skills, leaving all his spells almost impossible to cast, at a whooping one percent chance of successes.",
        "Possessions": "Red had a small collection of wondrous items on hand, such as a ''[[pot of holding]]'' for his gold, a ''[[wand of wonder]]'', and a ''[[spool of everlasting thread]]''.",
        "History": "At some point in his life, Red was ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into a leprechaun. Even though he was much smaller, and his magic grew largely unreliable, he preferred the new form to his old [[human]] one. When encountered, most people noticed that Red loved color red, evident by his clothes, and hated green, very much unlike other leprechauns. In his new form, he embarked on a quest for treasure, to fill his seemingly bottomless ''pot of holding'' with gold, in hopes that that pursuit was to grant him the true magical powers of the tiny [[fey]] folk."
