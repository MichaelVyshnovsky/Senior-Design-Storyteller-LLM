Harjad was an half-elven saka, or water-bearer, inhabiting Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Harjad was a crafty and clever matrud.
He spent his time begging coins from generous travelers who visited the numerous caravanserai throughout Huzuz. Harjad claimed that the water he supplied from a leather sack was obtained directly from the fountains of the Golden Mosque at great personal risk to himself. The water was in fact tepid river water.
