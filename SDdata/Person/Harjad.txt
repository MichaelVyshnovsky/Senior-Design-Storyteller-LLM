}}'''Harjad''' was an [[Half-elf|half-elven]] ''[[Midani dictionary|saka]]'', or water-bearer, inhabiting [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Harjad was a crafty and clever [[matrud]].

==Activities==
He spent his time begging coins from generous travelers who visited the numerous caravanserai throughout Huzuz. Harjad claimed that the water he supplied from a leather sack was obtained directly from the fountains of the [[Golden Mosque]] at great personal risk to himself. The water was in fact tepid river water.
