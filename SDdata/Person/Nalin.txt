Nalin was a very understanding man. He interpreted Helms dogma as justice being an ideal that could be found through penance rather than punishment.
He served at the towns local temple, offering healing services and certain divine items for sale.
Nalin wore a suit of plate mail armor and carried a +1 enchanted mace.
He thought highly of Captain Brage, the leader of the towns guardsmen.
