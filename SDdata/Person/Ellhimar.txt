Ellhimar was a human wizard living in Iltkazar.
Ellhimar hailed from Erlkazar but in 1366 DR he relocated to Iltkazakar, although he still considered himself a visitor. Around 1370 DR, Ellhimar spent all his time in scholarly research but revealed to nobody the aim of his studies. In time, his attitude grew increasingly grim and many started to speculate that he had confirmed a hypothesis that he hoped would prove false.
