Udi was a wandering wu jen in Bawa in 1357 DR.
Udi wandered the wilderness of Bawa, trying to help the local tribes. She acted as healer and mediator between different tribes. She did not care about the Bavanese laws, customs, and property however.
For this, Udi was greatly respected among the Bawani people and no chief refused her counsel, but she was declared an outlaw by the Bavanese, risking her freedom every time she went into town.
