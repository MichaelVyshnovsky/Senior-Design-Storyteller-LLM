'''Udi''' was a wandering [[wu jen]] in [[Bawa]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Udi wandered the wilderness of Bawa, trying to help the local tribes. She acted as healer and mediator between different tribes. She did not care about the [[Bavanese]] laws, customs, and property however.

For this, Udi was greatly respected among the [[Bawani]] people and no chief refused her counsel, but she was declared an outlaw by the Bavanese, risking her freedom every time she went into town.
