Mad Berfy was a gnome adventurer and member of the Emerald Swords company circa 1369 DR, who specialized as an illusionist wizard.
Berfy had a bright blue mohawk, and seemed to be unable to stop giggling.
Mad Berfy was appropriately eccentric in his behaviour, and annoyed his companions with his quirky tendencies.
He was a skilled illusionist, and knew an array of spells that confused or misled his enemies.
Berfy carried a dagger and a wand of illusion, and wore a cloak of displacement.
In 1369 DR, Mad Berfy and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis with a dagger of venom, so that the Lords murder would cover up his kidnapping. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.
