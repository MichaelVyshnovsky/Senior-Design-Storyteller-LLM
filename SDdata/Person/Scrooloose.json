        "Description": "Scrooloose had fair skin and wore a set of simple [[chainmail]] and a horned [[helmet]].",
        "Abilities": "As a fighter, Scrooloose wielded a [[short sword]] in battle and defended himself with a [[shield]].",
        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Scrooloose was part of an adventuring band that consisted of Shagbag, Korgan Bloodaxe, [[Crazyface]], [[Stitch (adventurer)|Stitch]], [[Hogbelly]], and [[Cutter (adventurer)|Cutter]]. The band collected valuable tomes for [[Pimlico]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. One day, the group erupted into violence over an especially prized bounty, ending the lives of Hogbelly, Stitch, and Cutter and leading to Korgan parting ways with the group. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Scrooloose accompanied Shagbag and Crazyface in confronting the old ally over the ''[[Book of Kaza]]'' the dwarf was searching. The outcome of the confrontation was unknown; however, all three lives were said to had been cut down by the dwarven berserker and his allies atop the [[Copper Coronet]] in Athkatla."
