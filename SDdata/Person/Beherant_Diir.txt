Beherant Diir was one of a group merchants who sold their wares in the town of Imnesvale during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a rather portly individual.
Beherant sold a variety of armor, including shields of many different designs and colors.
He worked alongside several other merchants including Elence Fielding and Min Minling.
In the , Beherant and his fellow merchants in town were infiltrated by a book-and-potion peddler named Fael, who was in fact an agent of the Twisted Rune. When Imnesvale was threatened by mysterious disappearinces and killings, Beherant Diir blamed them on a group of ogres who camped nearby. These killings also negatively affected Beherants business.
