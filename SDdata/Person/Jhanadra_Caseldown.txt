Since ''[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]]'' is set one to two years after this date, that means she logically would have to be a specialty priest in order to hold that title.

'''Jhanadra Caseldown''', known as '''Joybringer Caseldown''' after joining the [[Church of Lliira]], was a [[song dragon]] and the high [[priest]]esses of the [[Cry of Joy]] temple in [[Hill's Edge]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Caseldown was known to be quite enthusiastic.

==Abilities==
Caseldown was renowned for her skills in acrobatic dancing and her high, clear singing voice. Rumors also circulated around Hills Edge that she also had strange magical powers, resulting from her being a song dragon.

==Activities==
When not leading her clergy, Caseldown worked closely with the [[Harpers]] in secret to ensure the cultural growth of Hill's Edge, making sure it continued to be a pleasant place to live. But she also worked with them to ensure the city's security, keeping it from falling under the sway of the [[Church of Cyric]] and the [[Zhentarim]].

==Relationships==
Jhanadra was largely loved by the inhabitants of Hill's Edge, who affectionately referred to her as the Rose-Red Lady.
