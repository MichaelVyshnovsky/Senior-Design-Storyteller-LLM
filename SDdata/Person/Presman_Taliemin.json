        "mainbody": "Presman Taliemin was an Oghmanyte high priest in the city-state of Saelmur, in the Land of the Lions region of south Faer√ªn, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nPresman served as the high priest of Saelmurs local temple of Oghma, the Library of the Binder. And like Saelmurs other religious leaders, he also served as a member of the city-states governing council, the Councilium of Prelates.\nAround 1370 DR, Presman was frequently being pressured by his clergy to rally aid to the Oghmanytes who were operating a resistance movement in Mintar against the Knights of the Black Gauntlet, But unlike some of his fellow Prelates, Presman was undecided on the matter of whether Saelmur should engage the Knights forces in war sooner or later."
