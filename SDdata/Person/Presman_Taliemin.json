        "mainbody": "'''Presman Taliemin''' was an [[Oghmanyte]] high [[priest]] in the city-state of [[Saelmur]], in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faer√ªn]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Presman served as the high priest of Saelmur's local temple of Oghma, the [[Library of the Binder]]. And like Saelmur's other religious leaders, he also served as a member of the city-state's governing council, the [[Councilium of Prelates]].",
        "History": "Around [[1370 DR]], Presman was frequently being pressured by his clergy to rally aid to the Oghmanytes who were operating a resistance movement in [[Mintar]] against the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]], But unlike some of his fellow Prelates, Presman was undecided on the matter of whether Saelmur should engage the Knights' forces in war sooner or later."
