        "History": "Teldar was a pirate officer under [[Laershala]], the last pirate lord of [[Earthspur]]. He was the ''de facto'' leader of the pirates thank to his old age and his record of successful raids. Many believed he did not rule openly so as not to attract unnecessary attention. Teldar always gave wise advise to new pirates. He was renowned for his supply of [[magical item]]s that saved him many times over the years, like when he used his ''[[necklace of missiles]]'' to end the career of [[Cheves|Cheves the Scourge]].\n \nIn [[1363 DR]], [[Vurgrom]] managed to defeat Teldar, becoming the new pirate lord. Teldar exiled himself to [[Thesk]].",
        "Personality": "Teldar had little leadership ability."
