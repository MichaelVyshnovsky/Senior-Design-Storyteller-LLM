'''Hydee''' was a member of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] in [[Skullport]] around [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Hydee was a [[cleric]] of [[Loviatar]] and acted in a supportive role to a Hand's team. Usually her role was to cast ''[[silence]]'' to the area of action, but often she could not resist entering the fight. Hydee was infatuated with Master [[Colstan Rhuul]], whom she had met a few times, but she was not as beautiful as his usual companions of Colstan. On one occasion, Hydee killed a female wizard whom Colstan chose instead of her.
