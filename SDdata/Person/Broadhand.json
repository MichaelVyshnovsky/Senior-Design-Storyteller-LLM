        "mainbody": "Broadhand was a blacksmith, owner of Broadhands Forge and Tack, and a high-ranking member of the Church of Bane.\nThe Banite man wore a metal vest over studded leather armor. He also wore a green beret, gauntlets, and wielded a quarterstaff.\nCirca 1356 DR, an acolyte of Bane reported to Broadhand. The acolyte had managed to intercept a letter written by a wizard, Amelior Amanitas. The wizard had learned a lot about a Zhentarim plot from an escaped slave, which of course was of interest to the Banites, who were historical enemies of the Zhentarim.\nBroadhand began writing his own letter to the Banite temple in Nesmé about the new information he had uncovered. However, no messenger replied (as the Heroes of Ascore-to-be had slain him), and Broadhand became very worried.\nThese same heroes arrived at the blacksmiths shop, and convinced him that they were the Banite priests from Nesmé. The relieved blacksmith led the heroes, whom he believed were the messengers, back to the shrine in his hidden back room.\nHe told the group that the Zhentarim planned to send armies across the Anauroch desert, and were close to reclaiming the fallen city of Ascore. The heroes were also informed that the Zhentarim had allied with the Kraken Society, and there were strange goings-on in Llorkh. Broadhand believed that the Banites had to act now to stop their historical enemies, and so he sent the adventurers on a quest to meet with the man with the information, Amelior Amanitas."
