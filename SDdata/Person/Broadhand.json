However, no messenger replied (as the [[Heroes of Ascore]]-to-be had slain him), and Broadhand became very worried.\n{{fq\n|text=They have forgotten that a single [[dagger]] at midnight may sow greater terror than 10,000 [[sword]]s at dawn!\n|source=Broadhand, on the [[Zhentarim]]\n}}\nThese same heroes arrived at the blacksmith's shop, and convinced him that they were the Banite priests from Nesmé.
