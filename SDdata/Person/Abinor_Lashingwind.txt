'''Abinor Lashingwind''' was the patriarch of a family of [[storm giant]]s who lived with them in the highest peak of the [[Gnollwatch Mountains]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].

He did all he could to keep his family secret from both the [[human]] and [[Crinti]] who lived in the lands surrounding the mountains in [[Dambrath]]. To this end, ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], he created the [[illusion]] of a moody [[silver dragon]] in the peaks to ward off any explorers or errant monsters.
