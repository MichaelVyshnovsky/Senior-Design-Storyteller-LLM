Hadeshah was head priestess of Chauntea in Daggerford around 1485 DR.
Hadeshah preferred to take care of the local gardens than speak to people. Her three assistants performed most of the rites.
Born in Gillians Hill, Hadeshah considered even Daggerford too great a town for her, full of people and walls.
