General '''Ignazar''' was a [[fire archon]] that long-served as an ally of the fire [[primordial]] [[Maegera]].

==Activities==
Unable to concede defeat, Ignazar never stopped his endless war â€“ he forewent conflicts on the plane of [[Elemental Chaos]] and brought forth a seemingly unending stream of [[Elemental myrmidon|elemental archons]] onto [[Toril]] to conquer the material world.

==History==
Tens of thousands of years before the [[Present Age]], General Ignazar fought for Maegera during the [[Dawn War]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Ignazar aligned himself with the mad [[fire giant]] [[Gommoth]], the self-styled King of [[Mount Hotenow]] and leader of the burgeoning [[cult of Maegera]]. Ignazar was granted use of the ancient [[dwarven]] stronghold of [[Fireguard Fortress]] to use as his own personal keep, to defend Gommoth and his followers as they took action to reawaken the slumbering primordial in the [[Prime Material plane]].
