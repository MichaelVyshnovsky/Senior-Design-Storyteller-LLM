        "mainbody": "The Hooded One was a mind flayer merchant in Mantol-Derith.\nThe Hooded One was curious and quite congenial for an inhuman monster. It believed that the prophecy in Evarells journal announced the day when the illithids would rule a world locked in darkness, ending the era of humanity.\nThe Hooded One usually sold gold, silver, and slaves in exchange for art and magical objects.\nAround 1479 DR, the Hooded One had arrived in Mantol-Derith very recently in 1479 DR."
