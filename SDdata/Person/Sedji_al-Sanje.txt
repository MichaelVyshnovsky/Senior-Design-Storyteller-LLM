Sedji was the commander of the guards stationed at the Grand Gate of Delights, protecting the main entrance to the palace. He earned his current position from a promotion after he recognized a holy slayer who attempted to enter the palace, spoiling an assassination attempt before it even began. Sedji recognized the assassin from his previous travels throughout Zakhara.
He had his own apartment in the Hall of Commanders.
Sedji traveled all across Zakhara in his youth.
