Halav was a priestess of Eilistraee. Halav was one of the Protectors of the Song in the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.
In 1377 DR, she was one of the six protectors chosen for an assault led by Cavatina Xarann on the main temple of Kiaransalee. However, Halav was the first casualty of the attack, killed by a powerful and massive undead consisting of the animated head of a giant surrounded by tendrils of darkness, which managed to take her and bite her head off, adding her face to the multiple wailing faces that surfaced on its skin. Although the undead was destroyed, her head could not be retrieved and she could not be resurrected with a simpler clerical spell. For this reason, Lady Cavatina instructed Chiszra to bring her body to the Promenade, where she would be made whole again and resurrected.
