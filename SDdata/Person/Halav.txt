}}'''Halav''' was a priestess of [[Eilistraee]]. Halav was one of the [[Protectors of the Song]] in the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]].
==History==
In [[1377 DR]], she was one of the six protectors chosen for an assault led by [[Cavatina Xarann]] on the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]]. However, Halav was the first casualty of the attack, killed by a powerful and massive undead consisting of the animated head of a [[giant]] surrounded by tendrils of darkness, which managed to take her and bite her head off, adding her face to the multiple wailing faces that surfaced on its skin. Although the undead was destroyed, her head could not be retrieved and she could not be resurrected with a simpler clerical spell. For this reason, [[Cavatina Xarann|Lady Cavatina]] instructed [[Chiszra]] to bring her body to the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden|Promenade]], where she would be made whole again and resurrected.
