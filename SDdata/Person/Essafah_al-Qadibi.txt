Essafah al-Qadibi was a sorcerer who lived in Liham in 1367 DR.
Essafahs vanity was only matched by his cowardice. Despite this, he managed to find success on several dangerous assignments.
Essafah aided holy slayers of Hajama with his magic. He was a member of the holy slayer faction known as the Loyalists. He was chosen to lead a few dangerous missions where he swiftly dealt with magically warded opponents, earning him high praise from his fellow Loyalists.
Essafah owned a fez of disguise.
