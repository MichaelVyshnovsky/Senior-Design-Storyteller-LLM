        "Personality": "Lana was an honest and stubborn but somewhat shy woman, preferring to observe others. However, once she became engaged in a conversation, especially about themes for which she felt strongly, she tended to ramble on and talk too much.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|8}}",
        "History": "Lana worked as a scribe in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. In 1491, she casually discovered that a secret cult had infiltrated the monastery and caused a strange storm that plagued the area. She was then attacked by these cultists and left for dead. She survived, however, and went to [[Mulmaster]] to ask for help.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|5}} There in the city, her information convinced the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], the [[Lords' Alliance]], and Zor [[Garwyl Gos]] to hire an adventuring party to investigate. When she met the adventurers, she explained to them all she knew.{{Cite adventurers league/Eye of the Tempest|8}}"
