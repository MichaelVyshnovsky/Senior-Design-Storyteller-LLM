        "Description": "He commonly wore wealthy attire comprising [[silk]]s and velvets under a [[cloak]] that was azure or deep midnight-blue in color. It had a cowl that he used to hide his face. By his appearance, he could be recognized as Calishite.",
        "Personality": "He venerated three [[deities]]: [[Anachtyr]], [[Azuth]], and [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]].",
        "History": "A native of [[Calimshan]], Ali migrated to Cormyr, where he became a member of the War Wizards.\n\nIn the late 1360s DR, court wizard [[Vangerdahast]] dispatched Ali on a mission to track down various criminals who'd broken the [[laws of Cormyr]], among them three thieves who'd been found guilty of murdering several Cormyrean nobles. Following certain rumors, in the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, Ali tracked the fugitives to [[Waterdeep]] and [[Undermountain]], where it seemed they would try to hide out in [[Skullport]].\n\nIn the month of [[Eleint]], he was a regular at the [[Yawning Portal]] after paying in advance for a month's stay in Cormyrean coin. He maintained a low profile, not giving his full name, taking a corner booth and monitoring all who came out of the well to Undermountain. Of his purpose, he said only that he was looking for someone who owed a great deal to Cormyr. In fact, his fine clothes and mysterious nature drew attention and the [[Tymoran]] priest [[Adama Miiralin]] stationed at the inn made efforts to investigate him, which he mentioned in his monthly report to High Priestess [[Seenroas Halvinhar]]."
