He claimed to be the \"true king\" of the islands as opposed to the ruling Kendrick Dynasty.\nLionel was the son and heir of Brynth Carrathal, the bastard son of King Reginald Carrathal and an Amnian woman.\nAfter King Reginalds death in the , the Carrathal Dynasty fell out of power, however the line of succession passed to Brynth in Amn. When Brynth died in the , Lionel became the heir.Canon sources do not explicitly state that Lionel was based in Amn, but Brian R. James (one of the authors of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide as well as the Realmslore Sarifal article in Dragon #376) clarified in a [http//archive.today/2024.11.01-193300/https//x.com/brianrjames/status/1673479035 Tweet] that he operated \"from holdings in Amn\".\nIn the , agents of Lionel Carrathal were blamed for the mysterious death of High Queen Alicia Kendrick, with many believing she had been poisoned in service of his claim to the throne. His loyalist insurgents in Callidyrr were subsequently defeated by the Callidyrr dragoons.Canon sources do not explicitly identify the allegiance of the insurgents during this event, but Brian R. James clarified in a [http//archive.today/2024.11.01-033539/https//x.com/brianrjames/status/1755442081 Tweet] that they were \"Carrathal loyalists\".According to Brian R. James, Lionel Carrathal was conceived as a key figure in the history of the Moonshae Isles during the writing of the 4th edition of the Forgotten Realms. This was demonstrated by him in a series of Tweets that summarized Lionels [http//archive.today/2024.11.01-194040/https//x.com/brianrjames/status/1817906600 bid to reclaim the throne] followed by [http//archive.today/2024.11.01-194624/https//x.com/brianrjames/status/2004811489 his death] during a conflict with Sarifal. However, very little of this lore found its way into official published products, and so only the material presented above is considered canon for the purpose of this wiki."
