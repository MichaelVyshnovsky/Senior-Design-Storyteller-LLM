        "mainbody": "'''Lionel Carrathal''' was heir to the defunct [[Carrathal Dynasty]] of [[Callidyrr]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] as of the turn of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}}{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|5}} He claimed to be the \"true king\" of the islands as opposed to the ruling [[Kendrick Dynasty]].",
        "Relationships": "Lionel was the son and heir of [[Brynth Carrathal]], the bastard son of King [[Reginald Carrathal]] and an [[Amn]]ian woman.",
        "History": "After King Reginald's death in the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, the Carrathal Dynasty fell out of power, however the line of succession passed to Brynth in Amn. When Brynth died in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Lionel became the heir.[[Canon]] sources do not explicitly state that Lionel was based in Amn, but [[Brian R. James]] (one of the authors of the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' as well as the ''[[Dragon magazine 376/Realmslore: Sarifal|Realmslore: Sarifal]]'' article in [[Dragon magazine 376|''Dragon'' #376]]) clarified in a [http://archive.today/2024.11.01-193300/https://x.com/brianrjames/status/1673479035 Tweet] that he operated \"from holdings in Amn\".\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1407}}, agents of Lionel Carrathal were blamed for the mysterious death of High Queen [[Alicia Kendrick]], with many believing she had been [[poison]]ed in service of his claim to the throne. His loyalist insurgents in Callidyrr were subsequently defeated by the [[Callidyrr dragoons]].Canon sources do not explicitly identify the allegiance of the insurgents during this event, but Brian R. James clarified in a [http://archive.today/2024.11.01-033539/https://x.com/brianrjames/status/1755442081 Tweet] that they were \"Carrathal loyalists\".<ref group=\"note\">According to Brian R. James, Lionel Carrathal was conceived as a key figure in the [[history of the Moonshae Isles]] during the writing of the [[4th edition]] of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]''. This was demonstrated by him in a series of Tweets that summarized Lionel's [http://archive.today/2024.11.01-194040/https://x.com/brianrjames/status/1817906600 bid to reclaim the throne] followed by [http://archive.today/2024.11.01-194624/https://x.com/brianrjames/status/2004811489 his death] during a conflict with [[Sarifal]]. However, very little of this lore found its way into official published products, and so only the material presented above is considered [[canon]] for the purpose of this wiki."
