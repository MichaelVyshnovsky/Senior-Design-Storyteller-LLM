Zongo was a triceratops owned by Faroul and Gondolo, a pair of hapless jungle guides operating out of Port Nyanzaru, Chult during the late 15 century DR.
Zongo was slow-moving and notably flatulent.
Zongo was sold to Faroul and Gondolo as a racer for competing in Port Nyanzarus dinosaur races. However, upon realizing that Zongo was hopelessly slow, they realized that it was only useful as a beast of burden.
