Emmezel Tersku was a Raumviran councilwoman and inhabitant of Drubiev in the Hordelands in 1375 DR.
As a member of the Council of Five Councilwoman Tersku helped govern the town of Drubiev. She devoted most of her efforts toward ensuring that Drubiev did not try to expand their commercial and cultural influence to the lands around the Golden Way.
Emmezel banished a fanatical priest of Kossuth who threatened to burn Drubiev to the ground with cleansing fire.
