Cork was a warrior and adventurer inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along Horse Way. 
He was friends with Maelwyn and often went adventuring with him. He was in a romantic relationship with Aswansea and wished to marry her, but the elf resisted his proposal because he was a "short-lived" human.
