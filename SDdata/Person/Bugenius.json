        "mainbody": "Bugenius (often called \"Bug\" by his master) was an eccentric sprite mage of the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe mage had blonde hair and brown eyes. He wore a ring of wizardry. Bugenius carried a spellbook, and a wand of magic missile. Bug liked to study magic and learn new spells. Given his good nature, he was eager to destroy evil creatures.\nIn 1358 DR, Bugenius worked on the second level of the Mages Guild within Myth Drannor. He accidentally turned his master into a bug when he trying out a new polymorph spell. Bug, however, was able to restore his master two days later, but the superior mage was mad."
