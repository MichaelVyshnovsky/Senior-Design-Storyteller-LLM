'''Hoth of the Six Curses''' was a mage operating in [[Murghôm]] in the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was named such for the half-dozen [[curse]]s he was subject to.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1246}}, Hoth was hired to hunt down and kill the hitman who had tried and failed to murder his employer. The hitman was [[Andaren Robyth]], a former thief who'd been partly polymorphed to possess a reptilian left arm. Hoth found Andaren dwelling in a cave outside [[Phannaskul]] and intended to kill him, but Andaren bargained for his life by giving Hoth the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''. Hoth accepted and settled for [[teleport]]ing Andaren all the way to [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]], where he had an eventful, but short, career.

Hoth had taken the ''Companion'' hoping it held something that would rid him of at least one of his curses, but nothing in the divine spellbook could help him. Disgusted, he sold it to a merchant in a bazaar in [[Murghyr]]. (Later that day, that merchant double-crossed another merchant, who was in fact a [[doppelganger]] and member of a [[druuth]] serving a [[mind flayer]], and died for his treachery.)
