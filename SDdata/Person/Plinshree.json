        "mainbody": "'''Plinshree''' was a guardian [[naiad]], a water spirit, who inhabited the complex systems of waterways and enchanted fountains of [[Myth Drannor]].\n\n{{quote|Then I will swim, yes, swim, even more beautifully than before, I will swim so that the rocks weep and dissolve, and sing the songs that wash the hills and valleys, and make them born anew.|Plinshree}}",
        "Description": "Plinshree spoke with a child-like innocent and happy voice. She felt deeply for beauty and the song of running clean water. She posessed a beautiful singing voice that echoed across Myth Drannor's fountains and waterways.",
        "History": "One of the spirit guardians of Myth Drannor's waterways, Plinshree had dwelled in the city since before the devastation of the [[Weeping War]]. She witnessed and felt the pain of magical demonic flames boiling her waters during the fall of Myth Drannor. With centuries passing, the magical pumps fell into disuse, and the waters became stagnant and poisoned by wildly breeding [[arraccat]]s.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], a group of heroes known as the [[Veiled Ones]] unwittingly repaired the water pumps of the ruined city, cleansing the poisoned waters and reactivating the magic fountains of Myth Drannor, freeing Plinshree from her torturous state. Happy to be free, she asked the heroes to recover long-lost water bells, instruments that could only be heard underwater, carved out of bone and enchanted. She wanted to hear the beautiful melody she loved so much in the days of the old Myth Drannor.\n\nSubsequently, the heroes found all three water bells and returned them to Plinshree, who rewarded them with ancient enchanted items from the glory days of Myth Drannor and departed to enjoy the music of the flowing waters."
