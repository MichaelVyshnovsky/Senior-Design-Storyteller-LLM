        "mainbody": "Whitey was a promising young assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR.\nWhitey was born in the Shore area of Westgate in the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR. His father was unknown and his mother was a festhall worker who died giving birth to him. He eked out a living as a street urchin until Tyaa Tymmyr saw him kill a bigger boy in a knife fight and decided to train Whitey as an assassin. The privations of his previous life made Whitey appear to be a pale, emaciated, twelve-year-old boy, a characteristic he made good use of in his work. After more than a dozen successful assassinations, Dahlia Vhammos herself took an interest in him."
