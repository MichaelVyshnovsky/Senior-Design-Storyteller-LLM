        "mainbody": "'''Whitey''' was a promising young [[assassin]] of the [[Night Masks]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Whitey was born in the Shore area of [[Westgate]] in the [[1350 DR|Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR]]. His father was unknown and his mother was a festhall worker who died giving birth to him. He eked out a living as a street urchin until [[Tyaa Tymmyr]] saw him kill a bigger boy in a knife fight and decided to train Whitey as an assassin. The privations of his previous life made Whitey appear to be a pale, emaciated, twelve-year-old boy, a characteristic he made good use of in his work. After more than a dozen successful assassinations, [[Dahlia Vhammos]] herself took an interest in him."
