|Ah, the Night Brigade is no ordinary street gang! They're way more organized than that, thanks to that dark leader of theirs.<br/>Having a high-powered Wizard in their ranks is part of that. The Grand Arcanist trains the other Arcanes in the gang, lets loose when they need something to explode in a [[Fireball]], and most importantly of all, helps 'em with reconnaissance.

==Description==
As a wererat, Wyshbryn had black fur.

==History==
Wyshbryn lived in Wheloon Prison with his fellow Riverside Rats until they were forced from their hideout by the [[Night Brigade]] under [[Storna Harnwood]], who turned it into a [[Temple of Shar (Wheloon)|Temple of Shar]]. After being driven outside the prison, Wyshbryn spied on the Night Brigade's foul Grand Arcanist [[Darstil Vurusk]], who performed horrible experiments upon helpless prisoners, and eventually sent an attack to kill him and end his madness.
