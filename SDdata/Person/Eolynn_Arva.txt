{{Quote
|What I mean by overgrown is — overgrown! Plants and vines and what have you. Coming out the windows, the roof. I took one look inside and that was it for me. Someone's got to do something before the overgrowth grows… over!

Around the time of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] returned from [[Thorngap]] carrying an unnatural disease. After he went to the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]], Eolynn heard that something strange was happening at his home and on investigation noticed that [[Uthe Lodge]] had become overgrown with unnatural vegetation, and brought attention to the issue with [[Anazar Narroun]]. Thanks to her, the murderous [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]] was stopped before she could threaten the town.
