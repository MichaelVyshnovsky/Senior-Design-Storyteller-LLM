Eolynn Arva was a human healer of Eveningstar in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR.
Eolynn had pale skin and black hair, and wore a long gray dress with a low-cut bodice.
Around the time of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the ranger Peron Uthe returned from Thorngap carrying an unnatural disease. After he went to the Eveningstar War Hospital, Eolynn heard that something strange was happening at his home and on investigation noticed that Uthe Lodge had become overgrown with unnatural vegetation, and brought attention to the issue with Anazar Narroun. Thanks to her, the murderous dryad Sylvie was stopped before she could threaten the town.
