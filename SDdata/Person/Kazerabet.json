        "''Necromancy is not just one school of magic among many. It is an Art, one that requires the Artist's entire devotion.''\n|Kazerabet, Angel of the Dark\n}}\n'''Kazerabet''', also known as the '''Angel of the Dark''', was a powerful [[necromancer]] living on the isle of [[Sahu]] in the [[Crowded Sea]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}": "=Description==",

When entertaining guests she donned an imperial robe and [[platinum]] tiara, both of which were worth a small fortune.

Her eyes were a strange steel gray and were said to flash like drawn daggers when she was angered.",

Her eyes were a strange steel gray and were said to flash like drawn daggers when she was angered.",
        "Personality": "Perhaps due to her extensive research into studying the black arts, Kazerabet was prone to fits of paranoia. She had an irrational need for privacy when conducting her research.\n\nKazerabet had a dominating personality and vast intellect.",
        "Possessions": "Kazerabet accumulated an impressive collection of [[magic item]]s, including a ''[[wand of fear]]'', a ''[[scarab of protection]]'', ''[[oil of romance]]'', a ''[[staff of the magi]]'', an ''[[amulet of terror]]'', ''[[bracers of defense]]'', a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'', a ''[[ring of wizardry]]'', a ''[[talisman of divining]]'', a ''[[wand of lightning]]'', a ''[[handglyph of power]]'', a ''[[nether scarab]]'', three ''[[figurine of wondrous power|figurines of wondrous power]]'', an iron necklace containing six [[barbazu]], and numerous magic [[scroll]]s and [[potion]]s.",
        "History": "[[File:Kazerabet2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Kazerabet enjoying her rule in Ysawis.'']]\nKazerabet, then '''Inanna az-Khunjhati al-Hilmi''', was born during the midâ€“12{{th}} century [[DR]], in the [[Cities of the Pantheon|Pantheist]] city of [[Hilm]]. Inanna was always fascinated with forbidden knowledge and eventually enrolled in the university in Hilm to feed her curiosity.\n\nKazerabet spent two centuries studying and researching the dark arts of [[necromancy]]. In order to learn more about the secrets of life, she mastered the secrets of death She and her husband learned the forbidden practice of necromancy from an [[ajami]] mage known only as [[Al-Nasr]], \"The Vulture\".\n\nThrough her studies, she discovered references to an ancient necromantic artifact known as the [[Talisman of Shajar]]. Through her skilled divinations, she was led to the ruins of [[Ysawis]] in search of this powerful artifact. Frustrated by the artifact's elusiveness, she and her husband raised an host of [[undead]] to search the ruins of Ysawis for the artifact without success.\n\nKazerabet was always fascinated by the ancient [[Necromancer Kings]] of Sahu. It was only natural that her research eventually led her to the mysterious island. While exploring on Sahu, she discovered the [[Garden of Eternity]] under the [[Vishap's Spine]] mountains where she encountered the ancient [[lich]] [[Vermissa]]. The two entered into a pact where the lich would share the vast resources of her library with Kazerabet in exchange for the destruction of one of the glyphs keeping her trapped in the Garden.\n\nKazerabet wrote the ''Art of Necromancy'', which, among other things, detailed the history of the Necromancer Kings on Sahu.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Kazerabet3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''Kazerabet, Angel of the Dark.'']]\nAs an exceedingly private individual, Kazerabet shared nothing of her past or her future plans with anyone.",
        "Relationships": "While attending the university at Hilm she found herself desperately attracted to [[Ezarhaddon]], a genius in the necromantic arts. Inanna eventually wed Ezarhaddon and fled with him to the mysterious [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] where she changed her name to Kazerabet, which meant \"Angel of the Dark\" in [[Kadari]] and her husband changed his name to [[Sumulael]]. Close friends of Kazerabet at the time also called her Zaribel, which translated to \"Angel\" in Kadari.",
        "Skills & Abilities": "Kazerabet spent much of her time and energy learning [[divination]] magic, though she was fully skilled in releasing offensive spells if threatened. Aside from her skill in necromancy, she also possessed a fondness for calling [[baatezu]] to her aid."
