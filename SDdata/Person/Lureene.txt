Lureene was an innkeeper at the Rising Moon in Highmoon, Deepingdale, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was strong-willed and kind.
Her cooking was excellent, per Volo, who explicitly called out her butter tarts as amazing.
Lureene remained part of the staff at the Rising Moon even after marrying Gorstag.
She was quite proud of Shandril Shessair, who had once been an inn maid like her. She also married Gorstag, the proprietor.
Around , Lureene waited tables and flirted with people. She slept in Gorstags loft with Shandril, save on nights when she had a man she otherwise spent the nights telling Shandril what tales the travelers shared while waiting tables. Per Shandril, Lureene was constantly busy with the inn.
She was one of the waiters on the evening that the Company of the Bright Spear came to the Rising Moon, on Mirtul 6. She consoled Gorstag after Shandril left with the company and, on the night that Shandril returned, he asked her to marry him she agreed. As Shandril arrived, Lureene greeted her, and learned that too many mages were after the girl.
On the morning after, she kept watch over Shandril until she was fully rested. After Shandril left on Flamerule 9, Lureene looked for horses, only to find they were all dead.
Unknown to her, Shandril briefly scried on her while she was together with Gorstag, to no great consequence, shortly before their next contact They received another contact from her later that month on Flamerule 27, after Shandril destroyed the Wizards Tower in the Citadel of the Raven, learning that Shandril was with child. Lureene advised her to stop at two kids.
