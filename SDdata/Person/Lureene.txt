'''Lureene''' was an innkeeper at [[the Rising Moon (inn)|the Rising Moon]] in [[Highmoon]], [[Deepingdale]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was strong-willed and kind.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|220-225|11}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|231-235|11}}

==Abilities==
Her cooking was excellent, per [[Volo]], who explicitly called out her [[butter tart]]s as amazing.

==Activities==
Lureene remained part of the staff at the Rising Moon even after marrying Gorstag.

==Relationships==
She was quite proud of [[Shandril Shessair]], who had once been an inn maid like her. She also married [[Gorstag]], the proprietor.

==History==
Around {{yearlink|1357}}, Lureene waited tables and flirted with people. She slept in Gorstag's loft with Shandril, save on nights when she had a man; she otherwise spent the nights telling Shandril what tales the travelers shared while waiting tables.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|10-14|1}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|4-8|1}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|89|5}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|87|5}} Per Shandril, Lureene was constantly busy with the inn.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|26|2}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|20|2}}

She was one of the waiters on the evening that the [[Company of the Bright Spear]] came to the Rising Moon,{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|21|1}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|15|1}} on [[Mirtul 6]].{{cite book/The Forgotten Realms Atlas|105}} She consoled Gorstag after Shandril left with the company and, on the night that Shandril returned, he asked her to marry him; she agreed. As Shandril arrived, Lureene greeted her, and learned that too many mages were after the girl.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|348-351|16}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|357-360|20}}

On the morning after, she kept watch over Shandril until she was fully rested.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|361-364|16}}{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|366-373|20}} After Shandril left on [[Flamerule 9]],{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|368-373|16}} Lureene looked for [[horse]]s, only to find they were all dead.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 2005|377-386|21}}

Unknown to her, Shandril briefly [[scrying|scried]] on her while she was together with Gorstag, to no great consequence, shortly before their next contact:{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|257|15}} They received another contact from her later that month on [[Flamerule 27]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/The Hooded One (2004)/09-11 - Spellfire Timeline}} after Shandril destroyed the [[Wizards' Tower]] in the [[Citadel of the Raven]], learning that Shandril was with child. Lureene advised her to stop at two kids.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|333|Epilogue}}
