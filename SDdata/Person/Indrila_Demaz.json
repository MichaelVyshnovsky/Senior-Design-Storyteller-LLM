        "mainbody": "Indrila Demaz was the Queen of Velprin and leader of the human army that invaded the Yuirwood in response to attacks from the half-elves living there. She became queen in 1058 DR. A year later, in 1059 DR, she drove the half-elves further back into the forest. Eventually, in 1065 DR, Indrila was defeated by Brindor Ol√≥synne at the Battle of Ingdals Arm. This triggered the surrender of the humans and the formation of Aglarond."
