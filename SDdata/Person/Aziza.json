She ran a small shop called [[Books and Scrolls]] located in the [[Pilgrims' District]].\n\nAs a Reader, she collected books merely to have things to read, rarely giving the book's subject matter more than a cursory glance before purchasing the volume. She was an accomplished [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystic]], charging the handsome sum of 125 [[dinar]]s for a reading. If no vision came to her, she often created a broad telling that was open to the interpretation of the customer."
