'''Selydra''', or the '''Pale Sybil''', was an [[undead]] wizard living in [[Lorosfyr]] in the 1370s [[DR]]. She was a kind of [[vampire]] that consumed souls and magic.

==History==
Selydra went to Lorosfyr in the hopes of learning the secrets of [[Imaskari]] magecraft.

In [[1374 DR]], [[Araevin Teshurr]]'s party ventured into her realm in search of a shard of the ''[[Gatekeeper's Crystal]]''.

Selydra explained to Araevin that indeed she had the shard but she needed it to defeat the [[Maddening Dark]]. She proposed to exchange it for a [[thaluud]] scepter hidden in a vault under [[Anauroch]].

Soon, however, a battle broke out between Selydra and her minions and Araevin's party, but at last the elves prevailed and Araevin recovered the shard while defeating the Pale Sybil.
