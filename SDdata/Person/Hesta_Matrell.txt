'''Hesta Matrell''' was one of the three siblings, the second generation of [[House Matrell]], a noble mercantile family of [[Arrabar]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080519045858/http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Wizards/?doc=fr_vambrancp| title = Character Profile: Vambran Matrell| accessdate = 12-21-2021| date = 12-21-2021}}

==History==
Hesta was born on [[Alturiak 7]] of the {{YearlinkName|1315}} to [[Hetta Debrinne Matrell]] and [[Obiron Matrell I]].Growing up, Hesta, along with her three siblings [[Obril Matrell|Obril]], [[Dregaul Matrell|Dregaul]], and [[Xaphira Matrell]] were ostracized by noble families of Arrabar for being a young merchant house with no social weight behind their name. The fact only aggravated by the fact that Matrells were created by the bastard-born of [[House Mestel]]. Hesta's life was cut short on [[Kythorn 28]] of the {{YearlinkName|1356}}.
