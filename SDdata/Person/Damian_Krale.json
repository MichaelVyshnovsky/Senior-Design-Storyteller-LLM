The ultimate goal of his endeavours was mostly a secret and only a few of the leaders of the cells knew what it was.\nKrale was a massive man with a booming voice, both of which served to enhance the force of his impressive personality.\nIn battle Damian wielded Shadowstone, an enchanted heavy mace that was also a minor artifact created by Shar."
