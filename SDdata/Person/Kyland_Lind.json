        "mainbody": "'''Kyland Lind''' was a [[Shadow Druids|Shadow Druid]] from the dark [[druid circle]] in [[Amn]], located in the northeast of [[Trademeet]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Your careless meanderings across the great Mother Earth will not go unpunished.''|Kyland Lind}}",
        "Description": "Kyland was a [[human]] male with fair skin and brown hair who wore black druidic garb.",
        "Abilities": "As a druid, Kyland had access to nature's [[divine]] [[magic]]. Some of commonly used [[spell]]s of his were: ''[[chant]]'', ''[[invisibility purge]]'', ''[[defensive harmony]]'', and ''[[mass cure]]''. And Kyland wielded ''[[flame blade]]'' and ''[[summon insects]]'' spells offensively.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Kyland Lind and his fellow Shadow Druids dispersed nature's cruel punishment to civilized people of the southern edges of [[Amn]]. At some point, the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]] was asked to solve the dire animal attacks on Trademeet. Subsequently, the adventurer and his companions uncovered that the onslaught was the doing of the Shadow Druids. Spite having little goodwill for civilized races, Kyland and a small group of drained found themselves following [[Faldorn]] and her aggressive ways. That allegiance was said to had Kyland face Abdel Adrian in battle and be slain. However, some claimed that the confrontation took place after Faldorn's defeat, leaving Kyland and the Bhaalspawn part ways peacefully and the Shadow Druid vowing to work tirelessly fixing the nature balance broken by Faldorn."
