'''Thutai''' was a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] overseer in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon in [[1486 DR]].

==Personality==
Thutai cared little for his underlings. If a fight went bad for him, he always tried to escape.

==History==
Thutai was a Red Wizard assigned to the secret complex of Doomvault under [[Thaymount]]. As one of the most loyal and fanatical followers of [[Szass Tam]], he was tasked with the custody of the [[Chosen]] of [[Yurtrus]] [[Bandagh]] in the deepest levels of the dungeon. Heroes from [[Daggerford]] fought him in 1486 DR and Thutai tried to escape.
