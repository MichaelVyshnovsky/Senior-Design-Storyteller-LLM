'''Annaeus''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] priest in the [[Illefarn]] empire, and was responsible for the creation of the [[King of Shadows]].

==History==
When the Knight Captain of Crossroad Keep encountered his spirit in the [[Gem Mines]] in the ruins of [[Arvahn]], Annaeus stated that he did not regret his creation, before helping the Captain to unlock one of the statues of the [[Ritual of Purification]] designed by Annaeus himself to weaken the King of Shadows.
