Zalathorm Kirkson was the Netyarch, or wizard-king, of the nation of Halruaa in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As of 1367 DR, Zalathorm served as the leader of Halruaa and head of the Council of Elders. Zalathorms tower in Halarahh served as the seat of his rulership. When meeting with the Council, he would use a magical crystal orb that allowed him to contact all 400 Elders of the Council if needed.
At some point, Zalathorm enlisted the Halruaan wizard Dwalimar Omen and the crew of the skyship Realms Master to hunt down dangerous artifacts.
Among Zalathorms vast collection of magical items was a special carriage that radiated a globe of invulnerability upon command. This wondrous carriage was a true rarity in the arcane world since a globe of invulnerability was stationary when cast. Zalathorm never parted with the secret by which he was able to accomplish the magical feat of a mobile globe of invulnerability.
In their youth, Zalathorm and Akhlaur worked together to develop a spell that granted them both everlasting life.
Aklhaur was rescued in 1373 DR thanks to the efforts of the wild elf magehound Kiva and the sorceress Tzigone. After being released from the portal, Aklhaur launched an attack against Halruaa, triggering the Wizardwar. During the battle, Aklhaur faced Zalathorm, and both killed each other.
