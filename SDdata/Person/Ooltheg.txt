{{Quote|Beautiful! What colors. Reminds me of the [[sparkler]] tricks on [[Liar's Night]]!|Ooltheg}}

==Description==
Ooltheg was a [[hin]] man with a light skin tone and light brown, almost orange eyes. The halfling was a man of some means, judging by the quality frocks and buffy berets he wore walking the streets of Baldur's Gate.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Ooltheg attended a performance of some showy [[magic]]s by three spellslingers, on the [[Murl's Rest]] plaza in front of [[Sorcerous Sundries]]. The hin man was thoroughly entertained by the sparkling [[spell]]s that reminded him of the [[Liar's Night]] celebrations.
