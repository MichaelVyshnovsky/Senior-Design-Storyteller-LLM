        "mainbody": "ergeant \"Dusty\" Yates was a caravan guard of the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR who helped defeat the Blackdagger Bandits.\nShe was a natural leader among her fellow guards, and someone they could look to for answers when faced with overwhelming odds.\nIn the , Yates worked for Melkhor Goldseeker, owner of Angelhead Mine. She was accompanying one of his caravans along the High Road to the mine when it was attacked by the Blackdagger Bandits. She and the others survivors took shelter in the outlying ruins of Cragmire Keep, and Yates rose to the occasion as their de facto leader. But when they tried to leave, bandit huntsmen tracked and shot at them, and when they sent fast runners to alert Goldseeker, the gnoll bloodtrackers among the bandits caught them all.\nIn time, the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge learned about the raids from Goldseeker and found the stranded guards. Yates directed the adventurer to target the Blackdaggers huntsmen and bloodtrackers. After culling the bandits numbers, the group was able to contact Goldseeker and resupply themselves. Yates also explained Krag Foultooth, leader of the Blackdaggers gnoll bandits, had seized control of Angelhead Mine and taken hostages, and asked the adventurer to mount a rescue mission. Yates later met the mine foreman Mira Thamros and Harper agent Xalliana, paid the adventurer for their efforts, and directed them to another Harper agent, Garl Gnarlclaw, as asked by Xalliana."
