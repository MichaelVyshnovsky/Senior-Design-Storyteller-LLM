Half-elf
Lif was a poltergeist that haunted Trollskull Manor in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
Lif was a half-elf barkeeper who even after his death couldnt abandon his old tavern on Trollskull Alley and tried to scare away all new owners. In , Volothamp Geddarm acquired the place at a low price and later formally gave it to some adventurers whom he had hired to save Floon Blagmaar.
Lifs life was his work. If a new owner opened another tavern inside Trollskull Manor, he could gradually become quite accommodating to them.
