lich Human 
Wulgreth of Netheril was a rebellious Netherese arcanist who was transformed into a lich.
Wulgreth was a renegade arcanist dwelling in the High Forest when, in , the famous arcanist Karsus was experimenting with the newly discovered heavy magic. When one experiment with the Volhms drain spell threatened to collapse the whole Eileanar enclave, Karsus hurled the heavy magic over the side and into the High Forest. Living nearby the landing site, Wulgreths very life energy was drained into the heavy magic, causing him to be transformed into a lich.
In , Wulgreth was defeated in battle by Sunbright Steelshanks and Knucklebones while they were his prisoners after escaping a mock battle between Karsus and Ioulaum.
As an act of petty revenge on Karsus, despite him being already dead following Karsuss Folly, Wulgreth began to sew dissension throughout the Cult of Karse in the city of Karse. It was later widely believed Wulgreth had destroyed the city himself, years earlier in , to have revenge against Karsus.
At some point, Wulgreth transformed from a lich into a demilich.
On Nightal 30, in the , the Evereskan tomb guardian Galaeron Nihmedu, and his "allies" Melegaunt Tanthul and Vala Thorsdotter, traveled to Karse Butte in search of the Karsestone. There they managed to destroy Wulgreth of Netheril, once and for all.
