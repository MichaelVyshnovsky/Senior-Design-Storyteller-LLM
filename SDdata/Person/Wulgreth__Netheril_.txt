'''Wulgreth of Netheril''' was a rebellious [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who was transformed into a [[lich]].

==History==
Wulgreth was a renegade arcanist dwelling in the [[High Forest]] when, in {{YearlinkConvert|3451|NY}}, the famous arcanist [[Karsus]] was experimenting with the newly discovered ''[[heavy magic]]''. When one experiment with the ''[[Volhm's drain]]'' spell threatened to collapse the whole [[Eileanar]] enclave, Karsus hurled the ''heavy magic'' over the side and into the High Forest. Living nearby the landing site, Wulgreth's very life energy was drained into the ''heavy magic'', causing him to be transformed into a lich.

In {{YearlinkConvert|3162|NY}}, Wulgreth was defeated in battle by [[Sunbright Steelshanks]] and [[Knucklebones (person)|Knucklebones]] while they were his prisoners after escaping a mock battle between Karsus and [[Ioulaum]].<ref>

As an act of petty revenge on Karsus, despite him being already dead following [[Karsus's Folly]], Wulgreth began to sew dissension throughout the [[Cult of Karse]] in the city of [[Karse]]. It was later widely believed Wulgreth had destroyed the city himself, years earlier in {{YearlinkName|-326}}, to have revenge against Karsus.

At some point, Wulgreth transformed from a lich into a [[demilich]].

On [[Nightal 30]], in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the [[Evereskan tomb guardian]] [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], and his "allies" [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] and [[Vala Thorsdotter]], traveled to [[Karse Butte]] in search of the ''[[Karsestone]]''. There they managed to destroy Wulgreth of Netheril, once and for all.<ref>
