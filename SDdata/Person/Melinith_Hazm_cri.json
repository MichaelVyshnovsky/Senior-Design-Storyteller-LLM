        "Relationships": "Queen Melanith took a [[crinti]] named [[Sadalar]] as her consort. She had a daughter named [[Ausitil]].\n\nAfter Sadalar perished during the attack of [[Aventine]], Melanith took [[Nym Inthigg]] as her consort. They had four children together.",
        "Activities": "Melanith became queen of Dambrath when her aunt [[Cathakay Shintar]] perished while fighting a [[gold dragon]]. One of her firsts acts as queen was to decree that men would be responsible for the defense of the kingdom against growing threats from [[Unther]], [[Mulhorand]], or other nations.\n\nThough Dambrath had been ruled by females for more than 200 years, the complete split between men and women occurred during Melanith's reign when she announced that men would only have power over other men. Her decree was backed by the priestesses of [[Loviatar]].\n\nMelanith ruled Dambrath for 156 years. Her daughter became queen upon her death.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Queen Melanith was once saved from drowning by dolphins in the [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]]. After that harrowing experience she decreed that dolphins were a protected species within Dambrath."
