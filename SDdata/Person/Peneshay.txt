Lord Peneshay was the leader of the Order of Tye, an elite organization dedicated to guarding the members of the Lords Alliance circa 1372 DR.
Under Lord Peneshays leadership, the Order of Tye gained significant prestige, attracting overwhelming number of young aspiring knights. Peneshay implemented rigorous and dangerous trials for the squires that sifted out the weak and left only select few alive and worthy. In 1372 DR, Lord Peneshay sent three youths, Squire Blancheflor, Squire Launfal, and Squire Camelon, to slay a deadly and fearsome beast - the Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor, as their Knights Trial. Subsequently, the two returned successful and brought the dreaded MRCD to Lord Peneshay as their captured prisoner.
