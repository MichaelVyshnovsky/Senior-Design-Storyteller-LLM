Craggnor was a member of the reformed Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin.
Craggnor was a cultist and a great friend of White Wyrmspeaker Varramzord. For this, he was kidnapped by Talis Kasterel, who hoped to learn from Craggnor the weaknesses of Varramzord. He transported Craggnor to the Cults hunting lodge in the Greypeak Mountains. Despite bribes and torture, Craggnor did not betray Varramzord.
