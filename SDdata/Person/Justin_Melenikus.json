        "mainbody": "Sir Justin Melenikus was a paladin of Helm of the midâ€“14 century DR whose mission was to help and protect small communities in the Savage Frontier, especially those between Neverwinter and Waterdeep.\nSir Justin was a tall man with strong, broad shoulders. He had steel grey eyes and close-cropped brown hair that flowed down into muttonchop sideburns. He was rarely seen not wearing his plate mail armor and carrying his two-handed sword strapped to his back.\nLike most paladins of Helm, Sir Justin followed a strict code of conduct, but he did not let the law interfere with his principles of justice and preparedness. He was no fool and treated others with respect, honesty, and courtesy. He expected others to do the same. He also had no tolerance for cruelty of any kind. As a leader of men, he struck an imposing, powerful figure who spoke with utter authority.\nJustin was proficient with blades, clubs, and lances as well as etiquette, heraldry, horse-riding, reading/writing, religion, and history.\nHe typically wielded a magical two-handed sword he and wore magical plate mail armor and gauntlets of ogre power.\nSir Justin led an expedition of watchers to the Mere of Dead Men in order to rid the area of threats along the High Road that were interrupting trade between Leilon and cities to the south. His forces set up camp in the ancient fortress known as Iniarvs Tower just to the north of the High Road, where they routed a group of bandits who had holed up there. However, the bandits were up to more than the simple raiding of trade caravans.\nJustin Melenikus was raised on a farm near Waterdeep. When he was sixteen, his family was attacked by orc raiders after a particularly hard winter. Most of his family was killed and he was left for dead. Afterward, Justin made his way to the monastery of Helms Hold near Neverwinter. Vowing to never be unprepared, he found his calling to Helm and received his training in paladinhood while there. Ever since, he was a champion of law and goodness for small communities in the North."
