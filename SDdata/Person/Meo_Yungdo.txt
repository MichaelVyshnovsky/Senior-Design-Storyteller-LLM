'''Meo Yungdo''' was a noble of the [[Meo]] family of [[Xai Chung]] in [[Koryo]]. He was governor of Xai Chung and advisor to King [[Wanang Sun]] around [[1357 DR]].<ref group="note">Meo Yungdo is only stated to be an advisor, but as an important noble based in the city, and because some governors are top advisors to the king, it is assumed that Yungdo is also governor of Xai Chung.

==Relations==
Meo Yungdo had two children. His son, [[Meo Cha]], he sent to the [[Do Jang of Won Kwang]], a prestigious military academy in [[Pyong Do]]. His daughter, [[Meo Li]], remained at the family's ancestral mansion in Xai Chung.

==History==
Around [[1350 DR]], the [[king of Silla]] ordered "nameless ones" to kidnap Meo Yungdo's children and sell them into slavery. His reason remains unknown; it may have been for leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. Meo Cha and Meo Li managed to escape and ultimately returned home, while the tyrant king abdicated.

By around 1357 DR, Yungdo had been appointed advisor to the new king, Wanang Sun.
