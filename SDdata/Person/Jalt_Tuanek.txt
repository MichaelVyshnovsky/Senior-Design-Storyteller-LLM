Lord '''Jalt Tuanek''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]], the former patriarch of [[Clan Jalt]], and the lord of [[Ruinspoke]] in [[1480 DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Hand of Darkness|37-38}}

==Personality==
Lord Tuanek was level-headed and firm, but kind. He didn't like [[mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[adventurer]]s, because of their shifting loyalties, but he knew that they were needed in a frontier place like Ruinspoke.

==Activities==
Some years before [[1479 DR]], Lord Tuanek stepped down from his position as the elder of clan Jalt. He became the lord of Ruinspoke as his "retirement". There, he trained the new generation while dealing with Ruinspoke's day-to-day government.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Elder Wisdom|4}}

Lord Tuanek usually hired adventurers to deal with monster problems, to help Ruinspoke citizens, or to explore nearby [[Unther]]an ruins.

==History==
In 1479 DR, Lord Tuanek began to recruit more adventuring bands than usual because of the [[kobold]] tribes inhabiting the outlying areas, that had become bolder and attacked the nearby farms.
