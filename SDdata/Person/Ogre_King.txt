The '''Ogre King''' was a name given posthumously to an [[Oni mage|oni]] active in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
During his lifetime, the Ogre King sought to learn about the mysteries of the [[Dire Wood]], and he subjugated goblins to use as expendable pawns for his expeditions. Regardless, these goblins revered the Ogre King because they believed that he was leading them on glorious raids.

==History==
Around the turn of the 15{{th}} century DR, the oni who would come to be known as the Ogre King discovered some ancient ruins of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] realm of [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]] located beneath the [[Southwood]]. He proceeded to established a lair within the ruins and then subjugate all nearby goblins. For the next ten years, he sent his goblins on violent missions that took them far beyond the Southwood's borders. His reign was then cut short when he was killed by a group of [[adventurer]]s who were passing through the region.

In the decades that followed, the Ogre King's goblins and their descendants came to revere him as a god, having misunderstood that he was an oni and instead believing him to have been an [[ogre]] with a [[god|divine spark]]. The goblins ended up fashioning the Ogre King's skull into a [[mace]] known as the ''[[skull totem]]'' and one of his horns into a [[dagger]] known as the ''[[horn totem]]''.

By the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century DR, the goblins were led in their fervor for the Ogre King by their [[shaman|High Shaman]], [[Sancossug]], who claimed he could revive their dead god, who would then reveal his divinity, revive all those goblins who had died in his name, and then lead them on a glorious conquest. In fact, such [[magic]] was completely beyond Sancossug's abilities, although he truly believed he could do it.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, his plan was derailed when the [[wizard]] [[Curuvar]] of [[Loudwater]] infiltrated the Barrow, incapacitated the goblins, and stole the ''horn totem''. which Curuvar had sold to [[Garwan's Curiosities]] in the town's [[South Square (Loudwater)|South Square]]. The goblins breached the town's southern wall with a barrel of [[alchemist's fire]] and began attacking the townsfolk on their way to raiding Garwan's Curiosities.
