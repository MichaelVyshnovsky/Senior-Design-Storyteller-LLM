'''Marcos Craumerdaun''' was a [[human]] male and the head of the Craumerdaun mercantile family in [[Eshpurta]], which gave him a seat on the [[Shield Council of Eshpurta|Shield Council]] as of early [[1370 DR|1370 DR, the Year of the Tankard]].. Marcos was a cavalry trainer and had a good eye for quality horses, but did not deal as well with people in competitive business dealings. He only kept his Council position due to the influence of his nephew, General [[Labak Craumerdaun]] who was the advisor and ''de facto'' leader of the Shield Council.
