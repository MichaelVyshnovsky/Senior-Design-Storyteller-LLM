        "mainbody": "Galvena was a guildmistress who had many enslaved courtesans under her control. She lived in Brynnlaw, and conducted business in her festhall.\nLady Galvena was exceptionally cruel, and forced many young denizens of Brynnlaw into servitude and slavery. She would force them to do many despicable acts, and would control every aspect of her lives. She had the company of a \"pet\" wizard, named Vadek and employed several guards, who were lead by Rerdes. When in a combat situation, she wielded a mace and equipped leather armor. She hired many \"masters\" and would give them medallions to show their purpose to others.\nIn 1369, the guildmistress found out that one of her slaves, Claire, had wished to marry a local merchant named Sanik. They wished to elope, but this never came to fruition. Instead, Lady Galvena sent an assassin after her husband-to-be, and in the meanwhile, tortured Claire herself. She decided to sentence Claire to death, to make an example of her to the other courtesans.\nIt was rumored that many of courtesan slaves wished to leave or revolt against Lady Galvena. Among these were Ginia and Claire."
