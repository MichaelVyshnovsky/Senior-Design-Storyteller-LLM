        "mainbody": "Tammith Iltazyarra was a Rashemi artisan who lived in Bezantur in Thay during the mid–14 century DR. She was enslaved by the Red Wizards of Thay and transformed into a unique type of vampire by the atropal Xingax. Prior to her transformation, she was the lover of the bard Bareris Anskuld.\nTammith was once a beautiful young woman from the Rashemi underclass of Bezantur. She once loved Bareris Anskuld, so much so that she let him go circa 1369 DR to roam the world. After her mothers death, Tammith practically raised her younger brother Ral by herself. Her father Boravik couldnt overcome his grief and, though being a good potter, started wasting his money on gambling and drinking. Tammith was a good potter herself, but hadnt worked long enough to be accepted by the local potters guild. In the , in order to pay off a gambling debt that Boravik had with the White Raven gang, Tammith agreed to sell herself into slavery.\nAlong with dozens of other slaves, she was bought by Red Wizards and led to to Xingaxs undead manufactory in Delhumide. But, instead of giving her as fodder to his zombies, Xingax magically transformed her into a vampire. He also, against her will, magically bound her into his service. And from then on, she was constrained to serve Xingaxs wizards and their cause. \nDuring a fight at the Keep of Thazar, Tammith met Bareris again and tried to kill him. But he defeated her and even hacked her to pieces to end her undead being, and then fled. Somehow, she managed to change to her bats-form and was magically compelled to return to Xingax.\nOver the years and under Xingaxs tutelage, Tammith further developed her vampiric abilities such as keeping control of herself in bats-form. During the war of Thay over the following years, Tammith continued to be Xingaxs slave and was magically constrained to obey him and the lich Szass Tam too. She became the captain of The Silent Company, a force comprising vampires mostly created by Tammith herself over the years. These vampires retained the usual vampiric powers, not inheriting their makers extraordinary prowess. \nWhen the Spellplague hit during the fight at the Keep of Sorrows in the , the enchantments compelling her obedience to the undead masters vanished, enabling Tammith to finally flee Xingaxs influence. She sought out the Council of Zulkirs and asked to enlist in the fight for the councils cause—and the opportunity to satisfy her thirst for vengeance.\nWhen she almost died during a battle at Xingaxs fortress and Bareris \"healed\" her unconscious body by offering his own blood, their relationship became more compassionate. Tammith fought alongside Bareris in whichever battle the zulkirs forces had to face. She also followed the zulkirs to Bezantur after their defeat at the second fight at the Keep of Sorrows. When the zulkirs were forced to abandon Bezantur in the face of Szasss approaching legions, Tammith went with them aboard one of their vessels knowing that she couldnt properly join in any fight not taking place on board the vessel she one. Her nemesis Tsagoth also joined in an ocean battle fight, seeking out and finally facing up with the vampire again, determined to kill her. After a short fight, the fiend had her heavily injured and incapacitated. Then Bareris, his friend Mirror, and Bareriss griffon Winddancer joined the fight to defend Tammith, turning the fight in their favor by almost killing Tsagoth. But in a desperate move, Tsagoth grabbed Tammith and together they broke through the railing of the ship and plummeted into the sea. Due to her vampire nature, the water immobilized Tammith completely, slowly dissolving her body like acid. Bareris and Winddancer followed them into the water resuming their attack on Tsagoth until he was forced to transport himself through space to safety. Though Bareris hurried to get his love out of the water, he didnt make it in time and Tammith perished, dissolved into nothingness by the seawater.\nIn life, Tammith was a petite and dark-haired woman As a vampire, Tammith retained her former beauty, with a face now whiter than white. Her voice was still sweet but had a cold and flat tone, sounding like a mere travesty of her former voice Her skin lost its warmth, now feeling deathly cold. She was often clad in mail, her sword strapped to her side, but sometimes appeared wearing a plain cloak and gown.\nWhile normal vampires could only transform into a single bat or rat, Tammith had the ability to burst apart into a cloud of bats or a carpet of rats. In her bats-form, her sense of sight became secondary to her sense of hearing, letting her find her way by sonar cries. Though she retained her ultimate self, and managed her dozens of bodies without difficulty, she became purely predatory. Later, as she developed her abilities, Tammith retained control of her self in her bats-form more easily.\nDrinking fresh blood helped her mend her wounds in a matter of moments,\nShe could scramble up walls like a fly.\nHer touch could be as cold and poisonous as any specters touch.\nDue to her vampiric nature, Tammith couldnt cross open water, such as the open sea."
