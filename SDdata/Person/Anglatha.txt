'''Anglatha''' was a [[deepspawn]] who once inhabited the city of [[Tulmon]] in the [[Land of the Lions]] region of [[south Faer√ªn]].{{Cite dragon/244/Wyrms of the North: Klauth|55}}

==Activities==
Anglatha was captured by the vile [[archmage]] known as the [[Calavarr]] who used his powerful magic to change the deepspawn so that all of its offspring were small [[beholder]]s. The Calavarr then used his magic to take control of the beholders and use as he pleased.

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors persisted that Anglatha was successfully cloned, but these were never proven.
