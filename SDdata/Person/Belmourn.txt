Belmoun was a cook in Yûlash in the late 15 century DR.
Belmoun, together with Jamrry and Otiben, managed the chickens at the Red Plumes camp in Yûlash.
Circa 1486 DR, during the visit of Torin Nomerthal to the city, Belmourn may have helped to overthrow the First Lord.
Thank to his cousin, Belmourn was sympathetic to non-humans and helped them if he could.
Belmourn was cousin to the half-elf Constance Goodroot.
