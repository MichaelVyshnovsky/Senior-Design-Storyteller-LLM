'''Tohil''' was a [[fish]]er supervisor who worked in the docks of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Pilos Lafrett]], a lazy yet industrious fisherman, invented a device of pulleys and balanced weights that would do the fishing on its own, allowing Pilos a stress-free nap. He informed his boss Tohil of the invention and that it would be producing labor-free [[halibut]], but asked him not to touch the invention, while cockily also asking for a raise.
