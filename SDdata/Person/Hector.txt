'''Hector''' was an [[oni night haunter]] in the ruin of [[Spellgard]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Thanks to a partial array of [[alabaster pillar]]s, [[Thoran]] managed to summon and bind an [[oni]], who often disguised himself as a [[human]] prisoner called Hector. The oni planned to kill Thoran and enslave Lady [[Saharel]].
