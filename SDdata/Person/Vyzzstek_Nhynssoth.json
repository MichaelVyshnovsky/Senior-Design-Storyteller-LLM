        "mainbody": "Vyzzstek Nhynssoth was the Arcane Brotherhood representative in Skullport.\nAround 1370 DR, Vyzzstek posed as a loyal lieutenant of Zstulkk Ssarmn but in truth was the eyes and ears of the Arcane Brotherhood under his master, the South Overwizard Deltagar Zelhund. His position permitted him to subtly aid the Host Tower of the Arcanes interests and, at the same time, he kept under surveillance the Harpers, the Kraken Society, and the Lords of Waterdeep."
