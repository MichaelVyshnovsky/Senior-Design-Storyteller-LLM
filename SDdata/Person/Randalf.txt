==Description==
Randalf was a handsome, polite, and well-dressed pale-skinned blond halfling with blue eyes. He wore a quality [[leather]] jerkin, a leather circlet, and simple muddy-green breeches.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the army assembled by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] moved from the [[Moonrise Towers]] in [[Chionthar Valley]] to menace the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. However, Sylvie Summerworth was not particularly frightened by the encroaching army. Instead of being worried about the looming doom to the city of Baldur's Gate, Randalf and his friend [[Sylvie Summerworth]] stressed over undelivered [[pigeon]] mail. Randalf attended to Sylvie as she raged over [[Sword Coast Courier]] pigeon mail and suggested others to hold on to the mail until the situation was resolved. Unbeknownst to most, the pigeons were hunted and eaten by [[Gale Dekarios]]'s [[tressym]] named [[Tara]], who recently followed her master to Baldur's Gate from [[Waterdeep]].
