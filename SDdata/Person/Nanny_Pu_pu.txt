'''Nanny Pu'pu''' ({{Pronounce|POO|poo|refs=}}) was a [[green hag]] and the lone inhabitant of [[Mbala]] in [[Chult]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She appeared as an [[arthritis|arthritic]] old crone, with skeletal features and sallow skin. She wore yellow [[clay]] streaked over her dark skinned face in an apparent design of a skull. She walked with such a pronounced hunch that she appeared almost bestial.

She was a worshiper of the deity [[Myrkul]].

==Personality==

Nanny Pu'pu played the role of an old wise woman perfectly even as she conspired to kill and eat any travelers she met. Her preferred method was to isolate individuals from their friends and pick them off one-by-one in order to avoid direct conflict.

Those who sought out Nanny Pu'pu for her [[magic]]al aid or for her knowledge had to be prepared to perform multiple, often dangerous favors for her: she never offered anything for free.

==Abilities==
Nanny Pu'pu was proficient in [[necromancy]], notably the raising of [[zombie]]s and the creation of [[crawling claw]]s.

She was also able to use illusions to disguise not only herself but the whole of the ruins of Mbala to lure unsuspecting travelers into her clutches. She could throw her voice within Mbala, allowing her to speak to or taunt intruders without revealing herself to them. 

==Possessions==
Within the remains of Mbala, Nanny Pu'pu made her home in a "hut" southwest of the town entrance. This structure was in fact the rib cage of a massive [[reptile]] that was covered in [[thatch]] and [[animal]] hides and festooned with [[windchime]]s made of made of animal skulls, [[shell]]s, [[feather]]s, and other totems. She maintained a small root garden as well as animal [[snare]]s for food.

If she acquired any treasures, such as [[gemstone]]s or [[spell scroll]]s, she did not store them in her hut but instead stashed them in a [[sack]] made of human skin that she hid in a secret, flooded compartment in Mbala's old cistern. At some point, she came into possession of ten [[adamantine]] [[ingot]]s from [[Hrakhamar]].

==Relationships==
Nanny Pu'pu had a [[flesh golem]] guardian that she kept in a shallow grave outside her hut. She also used a number of [[flying monkey]]s to gather food and other items.

She was hated by the jungle guide [[Eku]], who regarded her as one of Chult's greatest villains and encouraged [[good]]ly [[adventurer]]s to slay her. She was also known, at least by reputation, to both Blaze [[Liara Portyr]], leader of the [[Flaming Fist]] at [[Fort Beluarian]], and one of her charms ended up in his possession. She also had evil designs for [[Saja N'baza]], the [[guardian naga]] of [[Orolunga]], and desired Saja's scales for use in her magic.

She wished to destroy a flock of twenty [[pterafolk]] that had taken up residence on the southside of Mbala, and this flock was sufficiently scared of her that they wore protective charms in the shape of her effigy. Similarly, she wished death on a local tribe of [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s who coveted her magic and would attempt to steal things from her in hopes of acquiring [[shaman]]istic  power.

When [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] took up residence within the [[Heart of Ubtao]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Nanny Pu'pu wished to be rid of her.

==History==
She was well-known as a powerful [[witch doctor]] among the people of Chult, and was said to have been around for as long as anyone could remember.

At some point, Nanny Pu'pu killed and ate the inhabitants of Mbala while posing as an old witch doctor,

When the worldwide [[death curse]] was identified as originating in Chult during the late 15{{th}} century DR,{{ToA-time}} many suspected that Nanny Pu'pu had knowledge of the curse's origin. In truth, she knew little about it, although she did know of [[Omu]] and of the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]&mdash;if not their precise location&mdash; and shared this information with one group of adventurers in exchange for their help driving Valindra Shadowmantle from the Heart of Ubtao. Meanwhile, she aided another group of heroes by "reviving" their companion [[Celeste]] with the Rite of Stolen Life in exchange for them retrieving her stolen [[juju bag]]s from a tribe of Batiri.

On or just before the [[Alturiak 14|14th of Alturiak]] that followed the appearance of the death curse, she waylaid a merchant caravan on its way to Camp Vengeance and fooled the survivors into following her to Mbala to seek refuge. There, she killed and either ate or reanimated the whole caravan with the exception of a [[tabaxi]] [[minstrel]] named [[Birdsong]], whom she kept in a cage for her entertainment until a rescue party arrived.
