Kulurauk was a senior officer of the Flaming Fist mercenary company during the midâ€“14 century DR. Along with their comrades Beluarion, Desedrak and others, they served under Grand Duke Eltan as battle-commanders and elite bodyguards within the Fist. 
Unlike other officers, such as Nenon, Yulimtul and even Scar, Kulurauk was absent from the Flaming Fists expeditions into Chult and Maztica during the 1360s.
