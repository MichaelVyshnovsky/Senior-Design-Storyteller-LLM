        "Relationships": "Thrimbul had a strong ally and good friend in [[Heartleaf]], a [[dryad]] that dwelled within a lone tree that grew just outside the entrance into Mount Hotenow.",
        "History": "Years Mount Hotenow erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, and the city of [[Neverwinter]] was well underway in its rebuilding efforts, dwarves of [[Clan Hillborn]] led an expedition into the volcanic mountain. A set of [[Fireguard Fortress|dwarven ruins]] dating back to ancient [[Delzoun]] had been uncovered, and the Hillborn expedition sought to investigate, hoping to link the lost fortress to the fabled dwarven realm of [[Gauntlgrym]].\n\nThe work of historian Thrimbul and that of the rest of the expedition was greatly hampered by the activities of the mad [[fire giant]] [[Gommoth]] and the [[cult of Maegera]]. Thrimbul worked with the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to recover some ancient dwarven artifacts, cull the number of [[Elemental myrmidon|fire archon]]s that roamed around the ruins, and defeat their leader, [[Ignazar|General Ignazar]] deep within [[Fireguard Fortress]]."
