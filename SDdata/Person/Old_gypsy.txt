The old gypsy was a mysterious and ragged gypsy woman that lived in the slums of Old Phlan around 1358 DR.
This woman lived as a fortuneteller, charging those who visited her just a few copper pieces to have their fortune read within her crystal ball.
Those who dared to attack the woman would incite the wrath of the various goblinoids, kobolds, ogres, orcs, and trolls that lived the in walled-off slums of Phlan at the time.Attacking this character would cause random encounters in Old Phlan to become both harder and more frequent.
Around 1358 DR, a group of adventurers on a quest to slay the entity known as Tyranthraxus visited this woman on more than one occasion to receive fortunes of what lied ahead of them.
