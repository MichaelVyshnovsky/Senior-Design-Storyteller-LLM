{{Quote|Blood and violence are writ boldly in your future. Look for friends where you expect enemies and enemies where you expect allies|One of the gypsy's fortunes to the heroes of Phlan.}}

==Activities==

==Relationships==
Those who dared to attack the woman would incite the wrath of the various [[goblinoid]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[troll]]s that lived the in walled-off slums of Phlan at the time.Attacking this character would cause random encounters in Old Phlan to become both harder and more frequent.

==History==
Around 1358 DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s on a quest to slay the entity known as [[Tyranthraxus]] visited this woman on more than one occasion to receive fortunes of what lied ahead of them.
