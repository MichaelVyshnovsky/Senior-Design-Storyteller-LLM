'''Nartheling''' was a gargantuan [[fang dragon]] living in [[Aglarond]] in [[1373 DR]].

==Activities==
Nartheling laired in [[Umbergoth]], near the border between [[Aglarond]] and [[Thay]], served by many lesser monsters like [[griffin]]s, [[asperii]], and other winged beasts. He also had a retinue of [[beholder]]s and [[wyvern]]s.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Nartheling was courted by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] [[necromancer]] [[Winn Kardzen]] to become a [[dracolich]] but his designated [[phylactery]], a horn of the fallen [[Shargrailar]], became lost in the [[Yuirwood]].

During the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]], Nartheling started to attack and kill the beholders on sight. His servant Lestch'cymatium called many more beholders to help and nearly started a full-scale war, alarming the populations of both Aglarond and and Thay. After the Rage, Nartheling ceased hostilities immediately and Lestch'cymatium returned to his service. Afterward, Nartheling found a series of ''[[portal]]s'' in the caves of Umbergoth and started to explore them.

==Personality==
Nartheling was a formidable foe. He had a very massive body but was also a cunning spellcaster. He was an expert in protection [[spell]]s, owing to his paranoia of being surrounded by enemies.

==Relationship==
Nartheling was served by the [[beholder mage]] [[Lestch'cymatium]] but after the Rage their relationship was a fragile one.
