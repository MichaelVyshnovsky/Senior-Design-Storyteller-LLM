Jekhal Windsinger was a priest of Torm that served as the nawab of Orpher in the nation of Durpar during the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was a strong leader and served his people well by diversifying their economic investments.
In addition to his role as leader of Orpher, Jekhal was the head of the Trollslayers, an adventuring company that acted as one of the citys merchant chakas.
Unfortunately for Jekhal, many of his fellow Trollslayers did not agree with the way he ran the city or the company.
