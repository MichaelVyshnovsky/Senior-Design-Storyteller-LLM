'''Hanor Kichavo''' was an [[Tethyrian]] [[monk]] inhabiting [[Waterdeep]] during the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.

==Description==
He favored yellow [[robe]]s and kept his head cleanly shaved. Hanor smiled often, but the excitement of his beliefs often came through when he spoke.

==Activities==
Hanor was the leader, or Monastic Abbot, of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]]. One of his prime objectives was to unite the three sects both within the order and beyond—that is, the followers of [[Lathander]], [[Selûne]], and [[Sune]]. He taught from ancient texts that the three [[deities]] were tripartite fragments of [[Amaunator]] and that the Yellow God would rise again once all three were united. Hanor's "heretical" teachings made him many enemies within the churches of Lathander, Sune, and Selûne in Waterdeep. Some even believed that Hanor was an unwitting thrall of [[Shar]] designed to weaken the collective faiths of her enemies.
