'''Lukamina''' was a [[druid]] from the [[Circle of the Moon]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Lukamina was a proficient shapeshifter who utilized her [[wild shape]] in battle. She often took on the forms of a [[hawk]], a [[crocodile]], [[wolf]], [[giant scorpion]], and a massive white [[bear]]. The scorpion possessed deadly [[poison]] and green spikes that ran along its back. The bear form's claws glowed with green radiance, giving her allies increased morale and battle confidence. The wolf form was a red wolf with its hide splotched in white patches and a green mane on its back.
