Lukamina was a druid from the Circle of the Moon, active in the late 15 century DR.
Lukamina was a proficient shapeshifter who utilized her wild shape in battle. She often took on the forms of a hawk, a crocodile, wolf, giant scorpion, and a massive white bear. The scorpion possessed deadly poison and green spikes that ran along its back. The bear forms claws glowed with green radiance, giving her allies increased morale and battle confidence. The wolf form was a red wolf with its hide splotched in white patches and a green mane on its back.
