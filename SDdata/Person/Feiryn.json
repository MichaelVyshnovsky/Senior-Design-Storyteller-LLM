As a guard, his fellows included Glavyn, and Errart.\nOne rainy spring afternoon in the , Feiryn was present when his fellow guard Glavyn tried to turn away a magic user answering to the name of Wanlorn, who insisted he was there to join Lord Esbre Felmorel at one of his feasts. Glavyn rebuffed the man repeatedly, until the man used a spell to freeze Glavyns arms in a cross-armed position, and then Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel ushered him in, much to Glavyns annoyance. Feiryn snickered a bit at the mans witticisms."
