        "mainbody": "'''Cernd Shattermind''' was a hybrid [[illithid]] [[dwarf]] living in [[Iltkazar]] in the year [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Cernd was a member of [[Clan Arnskull]]. In his youth, he was captured by the [[mind flayer]]s of [[Oryndoll]] and bought to their city as a mind-thrall. Cernd lived there for many years as a slave miner until his broken body became too unfit.\n\nHe was then selected as a subject for [[ceremorphosis]], which was unusual because [[dwarves]] were considered unsuitable for the procedure. In fact, the ceremorphois failed, resulting in an individual that half resembled a dwarf and half an illithid and with the personality of Cernd intact.\n\nCernd managed to escape back to Iltkazar. Here, thank to the intercession of the high priest of [[Dumathoin]], [[Bettargh Stoneshoulder]], the Regency Council allowed Cernd to live in the city, albeit under discrete but constant supervision."
