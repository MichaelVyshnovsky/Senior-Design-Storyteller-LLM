        "mainbody": "Thear Chessar () was a female shield dwarf rogue in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nThear was a dwarf of Clan Stoneshaft. Her appearance as a typical dwarf allowed her to be overlooked by pursuers.\nThear was very clever, using her image as a dwarf to avoid suspicion. She thieved mostly for the fun and danger of the situation. She kept her thieving under control in order to avoid being discovered.\nShe became close to Paerro a pickpocket that struggled to find his way in the big city."
