'''Carzakh Halandir''' was the leader of the reformed [[Shadow thieves]] guild in [[Athkatla]] on [[Amn]].

==History==
Carzakh was one of the five charismatic thieves and assassin that in [[1255 DR]] founded the Shadow Thieves guild and remain one of the leader of the guild for the years after until the [[1298 DR]] when the [[Masked Lord|Masked Lady]] [[Lhestyn]] unveiled the guild.
Carzakh was among the few Shadow Thieves that managed to survive the purge and went in hiding (one other was [[Marune]]); as most high surviving member was Carzakh that planned the next moves. Carzakh quickly promoted an other trusted assassin and thief with [[wizard]] ability to the command's chain and the Three (as they were dubbed) proceeded to the transformation and reformation of the guild.
The Three decided to move in [[south Faerûn]] and change the guild's focus from assassin and thieves to wizard and priests; those proved good moves and the guild began to infiltrated the government of Amn. After [[1341 DR]], when Shadow thieves had control over criminal operation in most South Faerûn, Carzach and the Three decided to reformed their-self as [[Shadow Council]] adding more members to the command's chain, but all [[Bhaal]]-worshiping assassins.
This proved a setback, because in [[1358 DR]] the avatara god [[Bane]] deduced to absorb the souls of all the assassins of the ''[[Realms]]'' and so Carzarkh and all the Shadow Council died, open the gate of the modern Shadow Council.
