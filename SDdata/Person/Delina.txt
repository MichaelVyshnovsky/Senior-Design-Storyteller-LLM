'''Delina''' was a [[moon elf]] [[wild mage]]{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|8}}

==Personality==
Inquisitive and fearless, she may have looked vulnerable but she carried a great strength within.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|9-10}}{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|15}}{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|17-18}}

==Abilities==
[[File:Delina, Wild Mage.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Delina, exhibiting her powerful [[wild magic]] abilities.]]
While Delina had tremendous natural ability wielding magic, she never truly accepted her potential to its fullest extent.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|11}} The source of her power originated from emotions and her empathetic nature.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|4}} It manifested in new and astounding ways when she or those she cared for were in peril,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|16-17}}{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|13}} or their emotions were too overwhelming to bear.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|13}}

Despite her potential innate power, Delina enjoyed using her magical abilities to bring joy to others, such as providing entertainment for children.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|19}}

==Relationships==
Delina had a complicated relationship with her twin brother Deniak.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|11}} While they shared the playful competitiveness that was common among siblings,{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|2-4}} while she felt guilt and responsibility for his bitterness.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|5-6}}

==History==
[[File:Delina Deniak.png|thumb|left|350px|Delina and Deniak during their youth]]
===Early Years===
As a child, Delina and her brother went to magical studies together, but she frequently skipped her lessons. One day, when playing and wrestling with her brother, he scolded her for her lack of ability and he refused to let her go. Enraged, her wild magic appeared for the first time. After this point, her skills seemed to surpass Deniak's, angering him greatly and making him jealous. His emotional state transferred to his sister, causing another wild magical surge.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|3-5}}

===Arrival at Baldur's Gate===
At some point, Deniak left for Baldur's Gate and later Delina felt her mystic bond with her brother become chilled, as if a strange darkness washed over him. At this point, she decided to travel to Baldur's Gate to save him.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|3-11}} Minsc began attacking the creatures and killed them. During the battle, Minsc believed that Delina was his old colleague [[Neera]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|11-15}} Interrupted by the city watch, they were blamed for a murder the gargoyles had committed. It became apparent to Delina that being "Neera" was useful for her search so she agreed to be called Neera. Casting ''[[color spray]]'', they escaped and ran into a pair of thieves.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|15-22}}

The thieves, [[Shandie]] and [[Krydle]], helped them get to safety and agreed to help them despite the fact that they didn't have anything to trade.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|6-10}} After getting the aid of [[Osgur Hallorn|the Fetcher]] for a return favor, the party was attacked by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in an attempt to capture Delina. After a quick combat, the cultists fled without their prize.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|13-20}} The favor the Fetcher needed was a delivery to [[Coran]], Krydle's father, who was in the upper city. In the festivities of the nobility, Delina bumped into a man she recognized as one of the Dragon Cultist ambushers.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|3-9}} As battle ensued, she was tackled out of a high window. Fighting on the roof, she was hit with a ''[[sleep]]'' spell and captured by the cultists. When she awoke, she met Deniak, now a member of the Cult of the Dragon.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|9-22}}

At Deniak's hideout, her brother revealed his obsession with stealing her power, by using a cult ritual and their mystic link.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|11}} Her allies made a brave attempt to stop the ritual but they failed, seemingly rendering her powerless and turning Deniak into a [[red dragon]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|19,22}}

After the ritual, her brother grabbed her, taking her with him to fly over the city. After a cunning plan by Kyrdle and Shandie, the dragon crashed into a building,{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|1-13}} where Delina demonstrated that her magical powers were still intact, helping to destroy her mad brother.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|14-18}} Afterward, she planned to leave the city, considering her quest to be a failure with her brother dead and the Cult in hiding. She reconsidered after talking to her [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate|newfound allies and friends]], who pressed her to stay, even being told by Minsc that Boo liked her.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|21-22}}

===The Domain of Dread===
[[File:Delina Krydle.png|thumb|right|300px|Delina strangling [[Krydle]] while under the influence of the [[Domains of Dread]].]]
The newly-founded [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] began to find work in the city, taking on a job from Father [[Alby]] to protect the [[Temple of Kelemvor (Baldur's Gate)|local temple]] of [[Kelemvor]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|10-13}} While they were unable to protect the defiant [[Kelemvorite]] cleric [[Nerys]], along with several valuable [[relic]]s, from being abducted by the [[werewolves]] [[Dron]] and [[Utna]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|17-21}} the group pursued the [[lycanthrope]]s into a thick cloud of fog that transported them to [[Barovia]], one of the [[Domains of Dread]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|19-30}} While they were able to reunite with Nerys, they were stranded on an entirely different [[plane of existence]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2|3-4}}

During the journey, Delina and her companions were given shelter at the [[Wizard of Wines]] winery.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|2-4}} The young elf suffered a terrible nightmare involving a monstrous form of her brother Deniak. When dream-Deniak began threatening Delina, she defended herself and grabbed him around the neck, unknowingly choking her new friend Krydle, who was also under some delusionary dream-like state.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|11-19}}

[[File:Delina Amulet.png|thumb|left|325px|Delina's [[wild magic]] surges often led to surprising effects...]]

After drawing too much attention to themselves at the bizarre and horrific "Parade of Purple" led by Baron [[Vargas Vallakovich]], the heroes once again attracted the ire of their werewolf adversaries, along with that of the newly-turned [[vampire]] [[Sangin]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|7-17}} and even [[Strahd von Zarovich]] himself. Delina and her fellow heroes recovered the relics that the Lord of Barovia desired,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|20}} and assailed the powerful vampire to prevent him from taking it back by force. Their attacks inflicted barely harmed Strahd, and even Delina's magic was largely ineffective.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|5-10}} Strahd overcame the group and recovered the necklace he wanted from around Delina's neck,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|11-14}} unleashing its magic upon himself and sealing his own fate.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|15}}

===Adventures in the Frozenfar===
Delina focused on the power of the necklace and was able to use its magic to transport her and her friends back to [[Faer√ªn]] on the Prime.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|16-20}} However they wound up hundreds of miles away from their home in [[Baldur's Gate]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|21-22}} in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains in the [[Frozenfar]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|2}} Stranded in the icy cold, they carried an injured Nerys into a hidden cave that Delina inadvertently discovered and gathered their bearings.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|3-5}} After fighting past a band of [[ogre]]s, during which Delina suffered a brutal strike from an ogre's club, they met the [[gold dragon|gold]] [[dragonborn]] [[Saarvin]],{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|9-17}} and continued towards the settlement of [[Fireshear]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|1-4}}

[[File:Delina blasting frost giant.png|thumb|right|400px|...that were quite devastating when directed at others.]]

The Heroes of Baldur's Gate were able to get some actual rest for the first time since departing Baldur's Gate. Delina and Minsc even had the opportunity to purchase new cold-weather clothes better suited for the [[the North|frigid north]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|5}} The peaceful time they enjoyed was short-lived however, as Fireshear was assailed by a band of [[frost giant]]s led by Lord [[Gryttmort]]. The heroes came to the small town's defense, demonstrating great prowess in battle and in Delina's case, powerful magic beyond what she had cast before.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|7-13}} After Krydle was able to free the giants' captured [[white dragon]], Gryttmort's band was forced to flee by ship and the heroes and Saarvin's allies emerged victorious.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|16-18}}

After the group managed to bind the half-frozen giant [[Fjurl]], the group "interrogated" their captive to learn Lord Gryttmort's plans to seize power in the region: recover an ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'' from the hoard of the white dragon [[Nilanthe]] at the top of [[Cold Crag Peak]], and use it to enslave the dragons to their will.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|1-4}} After a short rest, they made the perilous trek up the mountainside,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|6-10}} only to discover Nilanthe was the very same white dragon Krydle freed at the battle at Fireshear, along with the fact that Gryttmort had taken her children hostage.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|12-15}} Just as the heroes came to agreement with Nilanthe to free her young, the frost giant raiders broke into her lair, used the orb to take control over her mind and ordered her to cave-in her own home.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|16-20}} Thanks to Delina's newly-found power, she was able to shield her friends and new ally from harm.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|2}}

Once again, Delina and her fellow adventurers took time to recover following their battle with the frost giants. They met again with Saarvin, his ally [[Dasharra Keldabar]], and local leaders in town to prepare for and plan their attack.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|4-5}} With the aid of Dasharra's griffons, they snuck aboard one of the giants' ships and arrived at their glacier fortress in the sea.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|8-10}} They managed to sneak their way in{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|12-13}} and recover Nilanthe's eggs, before attracting the attention of all the frost giants.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|18-20}} A ferocious battle broke out between the two groups.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|4-8}} Thanks to the fact the ''orb of dragonkind'' was removed from Gryttmort's clutches,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|9-11}} along with a magically-enlarged Boo,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|12-13}} the heroes were able to defeat the giants,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|14-15}} and return safely to Fireshear with Nilanthe. In an act of selflessness, Delina returned the orb to the white dragon and ensured the safety of local townspeople.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|17-18}}

===Traveling the Planes===
[[File:Delina in Mechanus.png|thumb|left|300px|Delina surrounded by [[modron]]s in the plane of [[Mechanus]].]]
After the heroes returned to the [[Sword Coast]], Deline visited her friend [[Martikay]] in the city in order to gain more control over her wild surges. Markitay transported Delina to the plane of [[Mechanus]], believing the "place of absolute order" would allow her to release her inner chaos for good.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|3}} She was immediately rejected by the [[modron]]s that encountered her,{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|4-6}} and encountered a strange being that attempted to force her submission to the structure and uniformity of Mechanus.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|7-12}} Delina rejected the order offered to her; she was subsequently arrested for her chaotic nature and sentenced to exile from Mechanus back to the Prime Material plane.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|13-17}} 

Upon her return to Baldur's Gate, Delina felt she had earned a greater understanding of her own nature and came to terms with the complications that accompanied it.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3|18-19}} Reunited together one night at a tavern, Delina and her companions found out that Nerys had been inflicted with lycanthropy by a werewolf in their previous adventure.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|5-9}} As Delina told Father Alby, the group would do whatever it took to help their friend. They came up with a plan to free Nerys from the affliction,{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|11-13}} and subdued her bestial form,{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|17}} while Nerys found the inner strength to once again become whole in body and mind.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|18-20}}

Some time during the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Delina and Minsc encountered a [[Haruman|fiendish knight]] chasing down a pair of [[Torm]]ish paladins, and eventually abducting one to some other plane beyond Faer√ªn.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|4-8}} They rallied their friends and helped the remaining holy warrior, [[Aubree Lucent]] of [[Elturel]], with her investigation of an ''[[infernal puzzle box]]'' by visiting [[Fremin Greer]] and learning of the eternal [[Blood War]] that raged throughout the [[Lower Planes]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|9-13}} At Fremin's dying direction,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|19}} the adventurers continued on to the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]],{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|4-6}} and met with Great Reader [[Sylvira Savikas]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|16}} 

While examining the ''infernal puzzle box'' one of Delina's wild surges transported Delina, her companions, and Aubree into the city of Elturel during its descent into the plane of [[Avernus]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|17-20}} Trapped within the city tethered to the uppermost of the [[Nine Hells]],{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|1-5}} Delina and her companions once again battled the [[hell knight]] Haruman,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|8-14}} struck out against the [[devil]]s commanded by the [[amnizu]] [[Thavius Kreeg]],{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|5-8}} and briefly faced down the wrath of [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]] herself.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|12-14}} They survived in the hellscape long enough to return with Elturel, as it ascended above the hells back to the [[Western Heartlands]] of Toril.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|17}}
