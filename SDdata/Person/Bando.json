        "mainbody": "Bando the Lame was an old halfling priest of Tymora in Daggerford around 1370 DR.\nBando was once injured in a battle with three lizardfolk, which gave him an injured leg and a deep hatred for the scaly fiends. He managed the local shrine to Tymora, the Fairfortune Hall.\nHis home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along Horse Way."
