        "mainbody": "Zneth was an hobgoblin larva merchant inside the Wandering Emporium, which traveled across the plains of Avernus in the Nine Hells.\nOnce Zneth was a promising warlord in a Prime Material plane. With the secret support of Mahadi, Zneth rose through the ranks quickly and soon the god Maglubiyet instructed Zneth to go to Gehenna to lead a military campaign. During this campaign, however, Mahadi came to collect his debt and Zneth was forced to abandon the battlefield and go to the Emporium.\nZneth bought and sold larvae. He used all his profits to hire assassins in order to kill Mahadi and have his revenge, but the rakshasa only found this funny.\nZneth was full of frustration. He had dreamed of dying in the service of his god but Mahadi forced him into an eternity of obscurity."
