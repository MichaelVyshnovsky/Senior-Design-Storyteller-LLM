Zeearie was a githyanki Sword Stalker knight operating on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 century DR.
Zeearie was one of the Sword Stalker knights serving the Lich Queen, Vlaakith, on the Astral Plane.
In the , the Lich Queen sent Zeearie and some of the githyanki to recover the shards of the Silver Sword of Gith located on the Sword Coast. Zeearie led an attack by duergar and bladeling raiders on the village of West Harbor in an effort to find them. She identified one villager who carried them as the Kalach-Cha, meaning "shard bearer".
After Shandra Jerro was captured, the Kalach-Cha and companions needed to track the githyanki to their base. Zeearie expected them in the cave and recited the Kalach-Chas crimes, as well as her intent on probing Shandras mind. Once done, Zeearie took the Kalach-Chas silver shards, only to see one of them was embedded in the bearers chest.
To defeat her, the Kalach-Cha and companions had to destroy the pillars that sustained the portal (which prevented her from aging) or to use the object that Mephasm gave them before he departed. Once defeated, Zeearie warned the Kalach-Cha that the King of Shadows was going after them. She couldve been slain in the battle.
