'''Zeearie''' was a [[githyanki]] [[Sword Stalker]] knight operating on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Zeearie was one of the Sword Stalker knights serving the [[Lich Queen]], [[Vlaakith]], on the [[Astral Plane]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Lich Queen sent Zeearie and some of the githyanki to recover the shards of the ''[[Silver Sword of Gith]]'' located on the Sword Coast. Zeearie led an attack by [[duergar]] and [[bladeling]] raiders on the village of [[West Harbor]] in an effort to find them. She identified one villager who carried them as the [[Kalach-Cha]], meaning "shard bearer".

After [[Shandra Jerro]] was captured, the Kalach-Cha and companions needed to track the githyanki to their base. Zeearie expected them in the cave and recited the Kalach-Cha's crimes, as well as her intent on probing Shandra's mind. Once done, Zeearie took the Kalach-Cha's silver shards, only to see one of them was embedded in the bearer's chest.

To defeat her, the Kalach-Cha and companions had to destroy the pillars that sustained the [[portal]] (which prevented her from aging) or to use the object that [[Mephasm]] gave them before he departed. Once defeated, Zeearie warned the Kalach-Cha that the [[King of Shadows]] was going after them. She could've been slain in the battle.
