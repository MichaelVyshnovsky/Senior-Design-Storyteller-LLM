Thimblewine was the most notorious fence in Skullport. He owned Thimblewines Pawnshop.
Thimblewine was famous for always identifying the real value of items people sold to him and paying only 10% of it. His secret was that he used a medallion of ESP and a ring of human influence, with which he quietly and ruthlessly manipulated those who entered his shop.
