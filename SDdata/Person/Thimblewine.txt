'''Thimblewine''' was the most notorious fence in [[Skullport]]. He owned [[Thimblewine's Pawnshop]].

==Activities==
Thimblewine was famous for always identifying the real value of items people sold to him and paying only 10% of it. His secret was that he used a ''[[medallion of ESP]]'' and a ''[[ring of human influence]]'', with which he quietly and ruthlessly manipulated those who entered his shop.
