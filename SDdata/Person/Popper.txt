Popper was a nihilistic kobold merchant member of the Circus of the Last Days troupe in the late 15 century DR.
Popper was a short red-scaled kobold with a cheerful attitude and a snazzy hat.
The kobold ran a stall at the Circus of the Last Days where he sold various "edible" treats, some potions, like elixirs of guileful movement, potions of flying, elixirs of necrotic resistance, as well as smokepowder arrows and a single pair of dark displacement gloves.
In the , Popper accompanied the Circus of the Last Days to Toril and the city of Baldurs Gate. There, the kobold was known to steal various items and "treats" off of corpses, including a severed hand from the corpse of Dribbles the clown, on which he promptly gnawed.
