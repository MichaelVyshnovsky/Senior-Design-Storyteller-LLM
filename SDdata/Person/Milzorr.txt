'''Milzorr''' was the [[dwarf]] leader of the resistance against the [[Zhentarim]] in [[Llorkh]] ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

==Description==
The muscular dwarf had braided auburn hair and a beard. He wore a rugged green shirt fastened by a belt, and wore golden wristbands. Milzorr wore a dwarven [[helmet]] and fought with a [[battleaxe]].

==History==
Following heavy Zhentarim losses in the [[Battle of Ascore]] in 1358 DR, the dwarven resistance, headed by Milzorr, incited a rebellion in Llorkh. Milzorr rallied his dwarven comrades, as well as the [[Heroes of Ascore]], to swarm strategic parts of the town, as the Zhentarim forces were stretched.
