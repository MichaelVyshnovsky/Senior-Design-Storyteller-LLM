        "mainbody": "Arkhan the Cruel () was a dragonborn oathbreaker paladin of Tiamat who lived in the late 15 century DR.\nIn battle, Arkhan carried the magical axe Fane-Eater and carried a dragonscale shield. He also owned the Wreath of the Prism, an amulet that granted him control over a vicious manticore called Chango.\nAfter a brief visit to the world of Exandria, Arkhan replaced his left hand with a legendary artifact known as the Hand of Vecna, with the intention of using its power to free Tiamat from her prison in Avernus.\nBy the , Arkhan, having taken residence in a tower located near a monument dedicated to Tiamat in Avernus, had yet to succeed in his endeavor. Prolonged possession of the Hand of Vecna was slowly causing his left side to become corrupted, a process that could only be slowed down by sacrificing the life of good creatures."
