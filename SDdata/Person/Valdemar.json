        "mainbody": "Valdemar was a young green dragon that dwelled inside of Wyllowwood, within the subterranean dungeon complex known as Undermountain, during the 14 and 15 centuries DR. \nWhile Valdemar was originally used by the druid Wyllow to ward off adventurers that sought their fortune within Undermountain, a life-changing event altered the dragons perspective and it became a permanent fixture within the ecology of Wyllowwood. After this, the dragon began to refer to itself as Tearulai.\nWhen Valdemar was used by Wyllow as a guardian of her domain during the 14 century,\nSometime prior to the Year of the Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Valdemar was assaulted by an adventurer and was impaled by the intelligent sword, Tearulai, which became embedded within its skull."
