After this, the dragon began to refer to itself as '''Tearulai'''.",
        "History": "When Valdemar was used by Wyllow as a guardian of her domain during the 14{{th}} century,\n\nSometime prior to the [[1492 DR|Year of the Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Valdemar was assaulted by an adventurer and was impaled by the [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] [[sword]], ''[[Tearulai]]'', which became embedded within its skull."
