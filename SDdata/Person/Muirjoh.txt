'''Muirjoh''' was a [[half-orc]] [[spellcaster]] from the world of [[Nerath]], where he was a member of the Harrowfolk tribe{{Cite organized play/LFR/Closing a Deal|13}}<ref group="note" name="nerath">While Muirjoh is not outright stated to be a planar immigrant from Nerath, the only other appearance of a "harrowfolk nature priest" in any ''Dungeons & Dragons'' material was in "Touch of Madness", an adventure in [[Dungeon magazine 161|''Dungeon'' #161]] that was explicitly set in the Points of Light setting. Additionally, ''Closing a Deal'' has no explanation as to what a "harrowfolk" is and Muirjoh is the only one featured, leaving them as an anomaly rather than something fully converted to being part of the Realms. of Nerath's [[w:c:pointsoflight:Harrow Wood|Harrow Wood]].{{Cite dungeon/161/Touch of Madness|81}} In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], he lived in the [[Sword Coast North]] on the world of [[Toril]], in the wilderness around the [[Sword Mountains]].

==Abilities==
This spellcaster described himself as a "nature priest", wielding [[primal magic]] to utilize the wilderness around him in combat.

==Possessions==
Muirjoh typically wore [[leather armor]] and wielded a [[spear]].

==Relationships==
Muirjoh was allied to a few [[earth genasi]] and some creatures of [[elemental earth]], such as [[galeb duhr]] and [[xorn]]. Together they worked to defend their home from those who would seek to defile nature.

==History==
Sometime in early spring, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{Cite organized play/LFR/Closing a Deal|9}}{{4e-time}} a [[sun elf]] approached Muirjoh and spread false information about Lord [[Stedd Moonstar]]. They spoke of the [[Waterdhavian]]'s plans to mine [[mithral]] ore from the Sword Mountains, claiming the noble was planning to use the cheapest and most destructive methods available for extracting and moving the ore, including tearing up any plants in his way and displacing any creature inhabiting the Sword Mountains.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Closing a Deal|15}} Enraged by this news, the half-orc gathered his allies, determined to stop this devastation of the wilderness.

At midday on the following day, Muirjoh and his allies encountered the adventurers hiking up [[Mount Araddyn]] towards a [[stone giant]] encampment shortly after finishing breakfast. They tried to scare them away, not wanting to kill the adventurers but simply drive them away,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Closing a Deal|14}}

Convinced of their sincerity, Muirjoh opined that fighting them would do nothing to prevent Lord Moonstar's desire to extract the mithral and was pleased by their claims. He then offered his assistance in developing a safe means of transporting the mithral down the Mount Araddyn, as well as the powers of him and his allies. But Muirjoh also warned that if Lord Moonstar's efforts ultimately caused harm to the area that was irreparable, he would return to exact vengeance.
