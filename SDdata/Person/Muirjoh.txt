Muirjoh was a half-orc spellcaster from the world of Nerath, where he was a member of the Harrowfolk tribeWhile Muirjoh is not outright stated to be a planar immigrant from Nerath, the only other appearance of a "harrowfolk nature priest" in any Dungeons & Dragons material was in "Touch of Madness", an adventure in Dungeon #161 that was explicitly set in the Points of Light setting. Additionally, Closing a Deal has no explanation as to what a "harrowfolk" is and Muirjoh is the only one featured, leaving them as an anomaly rather than something fully converted to being part of the Realms. of Neraths Harrow Wood. In the late 15 century DR, he lived in the Sword Coast North on the world of Toril, in the wilderness around the Sword Mountains.
This spellcaster described himself as a "nature priest", wielding primal magic to utilize the wilderness around him in combat.
Muirjoh typically wore leather armor and wielded a spear.
Muirjoh was allied to a few earth genasi and some creatures of elemental earth, such as galeb duhr and xorn. Together they worked to defend their home from those who would seek to defile nature.
Sometime in early spring, in the , a sun elf approached Muirjoh and spread false information about Lord Stedd Moonstar. They spoke of the Waterdhavians plans to mine mithral ore from the Sword Mountains, claiming the noble was planning to use the cheapest and most destructive methods available for extracting and moving the ore, including tearing up any plants in his way and displacing any creature inhabiting the Sword Mountains. Enraged by this news, the half-orc gathered his allies, determined to stop this devastation of the wilderness.
At midday on the following day, Muirjoh and his allies encountered the adventurers hiking up Mount Araddyn towards a stone giant encampment shortly after finishing breakfast. They tried to scare them away, not wanting to kill the adventurers but simply drive them away,
Convinced of their sincerity, Muirjoh opined that fighting them would do nothing to prevent Lord Moonstars desire to extract the mithral and was pleased by their claims. He then offered his assistance in developing a safe means of transporting the mithral down the Mount Araddyn, as well as the powers of him and his allies. But Muirjoh also warned that if Lord Moonstars efforts ultimately caused harm to the area that was irreparable, he would return to exact vengeance.
