        "mainbody": "Doryn No-Mouth was a male human and one of the four staff of The Rapids inn in Teshwave in 1367 DR, working as a stableboy and handyman.\nHe was a young, fair-faced lad of around 17 years, but he was mute. Doryn was frequently harassed by the Zhentilar because of his particular condition, and they called him \"Doryn No-Mouth\". However, he was very observant and had the ability to read and write, a skill that the Zhents were not aware he possessed. Tula Woodsbridge looked out for him."
