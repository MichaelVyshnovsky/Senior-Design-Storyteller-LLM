King '''Seltarir''' was the ruler of [[Estagund]] in the [[Shining South]] during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Seltarir became king of Estagund when his older brother, King [[Selkarin]], died during an invasion of [[Dambrath]] before producing a son. Seltarir inherited a country where most of the young fighting men had perished in failed invasions of neighboring countries. Famine was also a serious problem at this time, resulting in Seltarir making a trade with a wealthy merchant named [[Jeradeem]], exchanging his crown for [[diamond]]s worth nearly one million [[gold piece]]s. This new-found wealth gave him a seat on the [[Shining Lands]]' [[Council of Merchants]] and led to the formation of [[Chaka Seltarir]].
