King Seltarir was the ruler of Estagund in the Shining South during the 11 century DR.
Seltarir became king of Estagund when his older brother, King Selkarin, died during an invasion of Dambrath before producing a son. Seltarir inherited a country where most of the young fighting men had perished in failed invasions of neighboring countries. Famine was also a serious problem at this time, resulting in Seltarir making a trade with a wealthy merchant named Jeradeem, exchanging his crown for diamonds worth nearly one million gold pieces. This new-found wealth gave him a seat on the Shining Lands Council of Merchants and led to the formation of Chaka Seltarir.
