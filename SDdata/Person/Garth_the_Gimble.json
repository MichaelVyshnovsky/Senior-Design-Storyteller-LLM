        "mainbody": "Garth, also called the Gimble or the Snake of Selgaunt, was a thief in Cormyr in 1357 DR.\nGarth operated in Selgaunt, Suzail, and Marsember, drifting from one to the other to dodge angry victims, pursuers, and creditors. Garth had an efficient intelligence network in those cities and often wealthy citizens asked for information from him for the right price.\nHe had many contacts in the area, especially among criminals dealing with warehouse fires and the resale of slightly fire-damaged goods. He could be contacted at The Black Stag in Selgaunt, the Roaring Griffon in Marsember, and any tavern in Suzails docks."
