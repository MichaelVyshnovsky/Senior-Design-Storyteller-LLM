'''Hartstrum''' was a Maestro matchmaker from [[The Fulfilled Heart]] agency of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Of course, we won't stop trying to arrange something for you. As we like to say at The Fulfilled Heart, there are no lost souls, only those who've yet to find their home.''|Maestro Hartstrum}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, master smith [[Gyldro Angleiron]] of the [[Rivington General]] smithy attempted to find a mate using Maestro Hartstrum's agency. Despite Hartstrum's best attempts, The Fulfilled Heart continually failed to find anyone interested in a date. In his letter to the proprietor of Rivington General, Maestro Hartstrum recommended Gyldro to commission a portrait that looked less like a blacksmith and more conventionally attractive. But even without a revised portrait, Hartstrum promised to never stop trying to arrange a date for the gruff [[melancholic]] man.
