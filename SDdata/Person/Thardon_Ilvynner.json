        "mainbody": "'''Thardon Ilvynner''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|516}} to {{yearlink|522}}.",
        "Appearance": "He was white-haired and sickly looking.",
        "Personality": "He was against the idea of mage cabals, and saw them as a threat to all Faerûn. In his final years, he was wont to strike out of nowhere friend or foe with deadly spells.",
        "Abilities": "He had a natural affinity for the weave such that he could make lightning crackle between his fingers without so much as casting a spell. His ability to tame wild griffons required almost no magic.",
        "History": "Thardon Ilvynner grew in power during the last years of [[Eldrus Wands]], planning on using it to thwart and destroy cabals of mages. His other passion was taming wild creatures, and he neglected some of his arcane studies to master that. He only accepted the office of the [[Magister]] when [[Azuth]] offered it because its defenses would grant him an advantage in completing his most important work, the ''[[Treatise on Monsters Known and Unknown]]''.\n\nAs his successes grew, so did his pride, and so slipped his sanity. It was a relief to mages throughout Faerün when he was slain by a challenger."
