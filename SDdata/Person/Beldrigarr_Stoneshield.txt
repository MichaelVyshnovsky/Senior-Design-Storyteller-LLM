==Relationships==

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Beldrigarr Stoneshield found the guard detail of [[Velzraedo Hlaklavarr]] almost cutting down a serving lad nearly as they crossed the threshold of the [[Brave Bustard]]. He entered, explained he was looking for them after they were found to pass counterfeit coins at the [[Sunset Sail]] tavern, and then checked up on Mirt at the location, who seemed distressed.
