Ronger Delphos was a merchant and the founder of an anti-thieves guild of Waterdeep some years before the late 14 century DR.
Sometime before the , Ronger Delphos attempted to create an antiâ€“thieves guild in the City of Splendors by hiring thieves as security experts for his organization, which involved guarding Waterdhavian merchants. Ronger Delphoss recruits were armed with magic wands that dispensed a hold person spell. To counter this, Waterdeeps thieves guilds purchased many belts of agility. This led to an escalation of the guild war between the thieves and Ronger Delphoss guards.
