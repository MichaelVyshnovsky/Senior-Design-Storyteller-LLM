'''Rosa Steelsar''' was an unfortunate child of the exiled [[Amn]]ian [[Parhek]] dynasty.

==Relationships==
Rosa was the child of Princess [[Rasa Parhek]] [[Dornar Steelsar]], and was the sibling of [[Choris Steelsar|Choris]], [[Rohav Steelsar|Rohav]], and [[Rhothar Steelsar|Rhothar]].

==History==
Rosa was born in [[Silverymoon]], and was only 9 years old in the {{YearlinkName|1297}} when the family was attacked by Amnian assassins. While Dornar and Choris fought to the death to give the family the chance to flee, only Rasa and Rhothar escaped while Rosa was killed and Rohav was kidnapped.
