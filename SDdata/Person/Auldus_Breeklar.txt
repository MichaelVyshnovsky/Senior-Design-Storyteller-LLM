Auldus Breeklar was a lord in Cormyr.
In 1480 DR, Storm Silverhand asked for the collaboration of Lord Breeklar and Lord Hamnlaer in helping King Foril Obarskyr I but Bleeklar did not believe her.
At last, it was discovered that Breeklar was the culprit behind the theft of income tax that Rensharra Ironstave had been collecting. An unidentified man killed Breeklar.
