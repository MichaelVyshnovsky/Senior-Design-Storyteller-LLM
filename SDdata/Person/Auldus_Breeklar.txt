'''Auldus Breeklar''' was a lord in [[Cormyr]].

==History==
In [[1480 DR]], [[Storm Silverhand]] asked for the collaboration of Lord Breeklar and Lord [[Hamnlaer]] in helping King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] but Bleeklar did not believe her.

At last, it was discovered that Breeklar was the culprit behind the theft of income tax that [[Rensharra Ironstave]] had been collecting. An unidentified man killed Breeklar.
