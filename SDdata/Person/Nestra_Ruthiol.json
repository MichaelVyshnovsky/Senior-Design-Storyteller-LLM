        "Personality": "Nestra considered her allegiance to the Lords' Alliance vital for the survival and prosperity of her city. She permitted the [[Harpers]] and [[Zhentarim]] to travel the streets, but she only dealt with them when it was absolutely necessary.",
        "History": "Ruthiol was accused of murdering a former lover, [[Kaidrod Palyr]], after arguing publicly with his wife, [[Tiarshe Palyr|Tiarshe]]. While she was cleared of the charges, some speculated that the [[Hand of Yartar]] criminal organization was involved.\n\nShe ruled Yartar while the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis of [[1491 DR]] occurred."
