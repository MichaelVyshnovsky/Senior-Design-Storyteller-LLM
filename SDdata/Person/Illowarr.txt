Illowarr was a ranger of Turmish in the late 13 century DR.
Illowarr met a dryad near a stand of shadowtop trees circa 1270 DR and became infatuated with her. For the rest of his days, he lived here amongst the trees. The village of Illowwood grew up on the site.
Illowarr acquired the powers to travel through trees, as with the pass plant spell, and create a tree door, as often as he needed. These were possibly granted by his dryad lover.
