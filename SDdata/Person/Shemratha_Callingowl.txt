{{quote|''The peace that mankind seeks calls from within each one of us, it does not call out.''|Shemratha Callingowl}}

==Personality==
Appropriately for her faith, Shemratha Callingowl was a quiet and reserved woman who rarely ventured outside her temple. She greeted visitors of her temple as personally preached pacifism and self-awareness. She could often be found by a bubbling pool of water in [[The Grove]], asking guests to dispose of their weapons into the pool in exchange for Eldath's wooden ''[[holy symbol]]''.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Shemratha was already the leader of the Goddess of the Singing Waters' worship in [[Faerûn]], who guided the church from The Grove, in the [[druid]] fortress of [[Cedarsproke]], [[Gulthmere Forest]].
