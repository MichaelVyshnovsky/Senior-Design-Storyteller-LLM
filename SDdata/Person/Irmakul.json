        "History": "To counter the growing spread of evil under the [[Shoon Imperium]] and a plethora of evil artifacts fashioned at the time, the [[Church of Ilmater]] sought a weapon to combat such evil. To this end, the sword ''Dornavver'' was completed in the [[275 DR|Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR]]. As recorded in ''[[Relics of the Righteous]]'', the senior clergy of Ilmater took the sword and gathered at [[Allyn's Anvil]] in the [[Alimir Mountains]] east of [[Calimshan]]. Irmakul was present, along with [[Revered Brother]] [[Filithan]] and [[Exalted Servant]] [[Volshur|Volshur the Crooked]] and many others of the church. There they conducted a holy ritual in which their impassioned prayers and howls of suffering enchanted the sword.",
