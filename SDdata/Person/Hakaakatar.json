        "mainbody": "'''Hakaakatar''' was a [[hobgoblin]] [[shaman]] and [[priest]] of [[Iyachtu Xvim]], who served a small tribe around [[1369 DR]] under the [[fire giant]] [[Oghalis]] in the [[Hullack Forest]].",
        "Personality": "Hakaakatar was canny and pragmatic in his advice.",
        "Abilities": "Hakaakatar was unusually wise for a hobgoblin, and as a [[cleric]] of [[Xvim]] could cast a number of offensively-minded [[divine]] spells.",
        "Activities": "He served the chief [[Gugak Thul]] as a temporal and spiritual advisor, and counselled him to continue working with Oghalis for as long as it was beneficial.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the tribe suffered many losses as they attempted to live in the [[Hullack Forest]], and accepted the leadership of the fire giant [[Oghalis]]. They turned to woodcutting and exploratory copper mining and began enslaving the local [[satyr]]s and [[centaur]]s, but they proved unsuitable for copper smelting. The tribe then began kidnapping [[human]]s from the nearby town of [[Thunderstone]], forcing their satyrs to abduct [[Troyappa]], [[Kenhart]], [[Joelem]], and [[Jonren]]. This finally drew the attention of [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers, who raided the camp and freed the slaves."
