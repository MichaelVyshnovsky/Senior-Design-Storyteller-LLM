        "mainbody": "'''Arina''' was a [[merfolk]] princess in [[Myth Nantar]].",
        "History": "Arina was a member of the merfolk [[Homurr]] clan and seventh in the line of succession to the throne of [[Eadraal]].\n\nShe was born in [[1354 DR]] to King [[Vhaemas]]. In her early life, nobody cared for this spitfire of a mermaid.\n\nDuring the [[Twelfth Serôs War]] at the [[Battle for Voalidru]], however, Arina suddenly summoned a pod of [[whale]]s saving her wounded father. The whales that followed her were decisive at the final battle in Myth Nantar against [[Iakhovas]].\n\nAfter the war, she was chosen as her people's representative in the [[Nantarn Council]]. Arina found herself to be very good in this work and she also helped her elder brother in matters of state while [[Voalidru]] remained in monstrous hands. In her free time, Arina taught merfolk songs to the whales and learned their songs from them.",
        "Powers": "As a member of the [[bloodline of Selana]], she could communicate with whales.",
        "Personality": "Despite most seeing her as a leading figure in Serôs, Arina was interested only in becoming a noted bard."
