        "mainbody": "Arina was a merfolk princess in Myth Nantar.\nArina was a member of the merfolk Homurr clan and seventh in the line of succession to the throne of Eadraal.\nShe was born in 1354 DR to King Vhaemas. In her early life, nobody cared for this spitfire of a mermaid.\nDuring the Twelfth Serôs War at the Battle for Voalidru, however, Arina suddenly summoned a pod of whales saving her wounded father. The whales that followed her were decisive at the final battle in Myth Nantar against Iakhovas.\nAfter the war, she was chosen as her peoples representative in the Nantarn Council. Arina found herself to be very good in this work and she also helped her elder brother in matters of state while Voalidru remained in monstrous hands. In her free time, Arina taught merfolk songs to the whales and learned their songs from them.\nAs a member of the bloodline of Selana, she could communicate with whales.\nDespite most seeing her as a leading figure in Serôs, Arina was interested only in becoming a noted bard."
