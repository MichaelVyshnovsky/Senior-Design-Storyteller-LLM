'''Othiiyr Velthrann''' was a [[sage]] of the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|86}}

==Activities==
His life's work was his study of the magic [[sword]]s of the [[Royal Guard]] of King [[Imphras I]] and King [[Imbrar I]] of [[Impiltur]]. These swords were among [[Soargar's Legacy]], a collection of the relics of Old Impiltur put together by [[Mage Royal]] [[Soargar]], but long since lost. Othiiyr dedicated himself to recording the legends around them, and pieced together the histories of eleven surviving swords: ''[[Ashram]]''; ''[[Dornavver]]'', or Demonbane; ''[[Ellendrin]]'', the Weeping Blade; ''[[Felthann]]'', or Liluth's Summertongue; ''[[Galathos]]''; ''[[Iltornar]]'', the Goretooth; ''[[Malagar]]'', the Burnfang; ''[[Palreth]]''; ''[[Sarghathuld]]'', or Orcbane; ''[[Tendar]]'', the Wailer; and ''[[Ulfindos]]'', the Corsair Scourge.

Othiiyr assisted the [[Knights of Imphras II]] in their continuing quest to find the lost swords of Soargar's Legacy.

==History==
He was able to examine at least one of these swords himself when, in the [[1342 DR|Year of the Behir, 1342 DR]], the thief [[Gort]] brought him ''Ellendrin'' to identify. Othiiyr offered to buy the sword, but Gort refused, hinting that a contact in the [[Moonsea]] had already contracted him to retrieve it. Gort left Othiiyr's house and that was the last anyone admitted to seeing the thief and ''Ellendrin'' again.{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88}}

In the late 1350s DR, an unnamed female [[human]] [[adventurer]] presented another magic sword to Othiiyr for identification. He found it to be the famed lost ''[[Telvaran's Enchanted Blade]]''. But the client [[teleport]]ed away without even paying, so Othiiyr revealed the finding to othersâ€”when a client didn't pay, it was permitted to break the traditional bond of secrecy meant to exist between sages and clients.{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}

He was still working with the Knights as of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], though the above swords were still missing.

==Relationships==
Othiiyr was a regular correspondent with fellow sage [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], and told him all about the swords ''Ashram'', ''Ellendrin'', ''Galathos'', ''Malagar'', and ''Sarghathuld''.
