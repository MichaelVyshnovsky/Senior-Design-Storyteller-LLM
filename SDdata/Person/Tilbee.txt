Tilbee was a named black bear that lived within the Harvesthome Abbey in Goldenfields during the late 15 century DR.
Some time after the War of the Silver Marches, Tilbee and its fellow bear Darlow made their way into the southern farms of Goldenfields. After being fed by the Chauntean farm workers, the bears made their home within Harvesthome Abbey and stayed there for at least a matter of months.
