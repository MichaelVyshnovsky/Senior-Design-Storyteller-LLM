'''Hadencourt''' was a [[malebranche]] [[devil]] in the service of [[Szass Tam]].

Tam sent him to [[Neverwinter]] to kill Tam's traitorous minion [[Dahlia Sin'felle]]. Dahlia traveled with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. In disguise, Hadencourt approached Dahlia and soon the [[elves]] were ambushed by many war devils. However, the pair managed to slay all of the devils and Drizzt summoned his magical [[unicorn]] [[Andahar]], who impaled Hadencourt.

Being banished to his home plane, Hadencourt promised infinite torments to Drizzt at the end of his exile but Drizzt told him to get in line behind [[Errtu]].
