Hadencourt was a malebranche devil in the service of Szass Tam.
Tam sent him to Neverwinter to kill Tams traitorous minion Dahlia Sinfelle. Dahlia traveled with Drizzt DoUrden. In disguise, Hadencourt approached Dahlia and soon the elves were ambushed by many war devils. However, the pair managed to slay all of the devils and Drizzt summoned his magical unicorn Andahar, who impaled Hadencourt.
Being banished to his home plane, Hadencourt promised infinite torments to Drizzt at the end of his exile but Drizzt told him to get in line behind Errtu.
