'''Azarell''' was a [[yochlol]] who disguised herself as a young elven warrior. She dwelt in the [[dwarf|dwarven]] mines of [[Icewind Dale]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She may have joined a group of adventurers on their journey to [[Menzoberranzan]].

==History==
She could be found by adventurers in the [[derro]] mines and offered to "watch over" the party. She explained to them that she had been separated from her parents, though this was a lie. Azarell was most unusual, possessing incredible strength, and able to cast [[spell]]s, despite being a [[fighter]]. It turned out that Azarell was actually a [[yochlol]] in disguise, and could have become aggressive if the party found out.
