'''Makalia Siannodel''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[mage]] who was interred in a crypt beneath the city of [[Neverwinter]].

==Possessions==
Makalia was interred within a sarcophagus decorated with [[gold]] [[paint]], and carved with a relief of herself and [[Chanelle Hallwinter]] walking through a forest together. Her tomb was filled with old [[book]]s, [[scroll]]s, and [[material component]]s, as well as a [[component pouch]], five [[incense]]s sticks, and a magical scroll of ''[[protection from evil and good]]''. Most precious of all was a small gold [[locket]] that contained a portrait of her love, Chanelle.

==Relationships==
In life she was the loving partner of Chanelle Hallwinter, a [[human]] [[knight]]. After their deaths, they were buried in twin crypts beneath Neverwinter with relief carvings on their sarcophagi depicting their lives together.

==History==
Makalia passed on to the afterlife while Chanelle lingered as a [[ghost]] with no memory, but their tombs contained enough clues to remind Chanelle of her lost identity and bring her some peace.
