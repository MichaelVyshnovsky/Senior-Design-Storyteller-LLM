Duchess-Consort '''Lawantha Silendia Blackthorn''' was a [[Calishite]] [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] and member of the [[Company of Eight]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Personality==
Lawantha had no interest in the politics of Tethyr but was deeply loyal to the Company of Eight; however, in typical Calishite fashion, she did not hide her disinterest well.

She was very interested in botany, especially in fungi.

==Abilities==
Lawantha was proficient with [[Quarterstaff|staff]] and [[dagger]]. She knew how to ride, swim, tie various knots, and use herbal healing treatments. She was especially good at recognizing different species of fungi, and she was experienced with the mushroom-hunting dogs of the town of [[Brost]].

==Possessions==
As an adventuress, Lawantha wore a ''[[cloak of protection]]'' and favored ''[[wand]]s of [[lightning bolt]]s''. She bore a magic dagger and ''[[bracers of armor]]''.

==Relationships==
Lawantha came from a large merchant family, and she had friends and relatives all over [[Calimshan]], especially in [[Almraiven]] and [[Volothamp]] in the east. Her cousin [[Thiel Ralmun]] was a member of the Company of Eight before his death.

She forged good relationships with her fellow teammates [[Marilyn Haresdown]] and [[Tardeth Llanistaph]]. Lawantha was unaware of the hostility of [[Manfred Arbustle]] towards her.

During the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]], she fell in love with the warrior [[Llachior Blackthorn]], and the two were soon married. His promotion to duke after the war made her a duchess of [[Cape Velen]]. The couple were infertile, which caused great sadness to Lawantha.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|title=Questions for Steven Schend|author=[[Steven E.

==History==
Lawantha was born in [[Calimport]] from a large merchant family. As a passionate naturalist, she traveled much in her country, especially in the [[Spider Swamp]], Volothamp, and Almraiven. She also traveled to Tethyr both to explore the flora of the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] and to visit her cousin. On these trips, she met most of the members of the Company of Eight.

In [[1354 DR]], while the Company of Eight was overthrowing the tyrant ruler of [[Darromar|Ithmong]], Lawantha's cousin Thiel was killed. Lawantha traveled to Tethyr to recover his body and return it to Calimshan for burial. The Company escorted her back to her country, and during that time, they became friends and had survived many challenges together. After her cousin's funeral, they asked her to take his place as the seventh member of the group.

During the Reclamation Wars, the Company of Eight, including Lawantha, joined the Loyalist army. It was there that she met her future husband Llachior. They were married after the [[First Siege of Myratma]].

After the set-up of the new monarchy, Lawantha was considered as the new court vizera, but [[Perendra Raslemtar]] was chosen instead, because the latter was of [[Tethyrian]] blood.

==Rumors==
Many among the people of Cape Velen disapproved of Lawantha, because of her ethnicity.
