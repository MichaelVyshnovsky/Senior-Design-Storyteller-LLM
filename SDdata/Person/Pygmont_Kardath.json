        "mainbody": "ygmont Kardath was a farmer in the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe and his wife were both rather overweight, she more than him.\nThe Kardaths lived in a farmhouse southwest of Ghars, about  from a fork in the swamp road.\nWhen Jasper sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred whilst riding home on the night of Eleint 16 in the , he fled in fear and the Kardath farmhouse was the first he came to after recovering his wits. Though they may have thought him simply hysterical and inebriated, they gave him hot tea and cake, listened to his tale, asked if they could help somehow, and even offered to let him stay the night, though Jasper declined and went on his way."
