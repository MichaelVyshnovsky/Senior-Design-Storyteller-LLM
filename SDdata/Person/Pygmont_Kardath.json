        "History": "When [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]] whilst riding home on the night of [[Eleint 16]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, he fled in fear and the Kardath farmhouse was the first he came to after recovering his wits. Though they may have thought him simply hysterical and inebriated, they gave him hot [[tea]] and cake, listened to his tale, asked if they could help somehow, and even offered to let him stay the night, though Jasper declined and went on his way."
