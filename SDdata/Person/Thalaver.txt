Thalaver was an adventuring mage and member of the Company in Crimson some time before the midâ€“14 century DR.
Thalaver was a native of Suzail and lived in his own tower in Cormyrs capital. He took a young Shandaril as his apprentice. On an excursion into the Stonelands with the Company in Crimson, Shandaril decided to betray her comrades and killed the entire group in order to take their magic.
He carried a staff of power and several spellbooks.
