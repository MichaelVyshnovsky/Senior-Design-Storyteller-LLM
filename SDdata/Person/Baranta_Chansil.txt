'''Baranta Chansil''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Bright, energetic and enthusiastic, Baranta was described as a whirlwind of energy.

==Description==
She was small of stature.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], she was one of the notable mages of the city. Hopeful Elturians regularly rumored of romance between her and Lord [[Dhelt]], ruler of Elturel.

One night in the mid-1360s DR,<ref group="note">The date of ''Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession'' is unknown; this date is assumed based on other works published at the same time. Baranta and Dhelt were in his bedroom when a supposed assassin attacked them, leaving them sprawled on the ground. [[Key de Effer]], of Dhelt's personal guard, responded immediately to the commotion, after seeing the door blasted apart by magical energy. However, the assailant was not after Dhelt's life but his holy symbol of [[Helm]], which he stole before fleeing into the woods. Key and [[Beatrice (adventurer)|Beatrice]] gave pursuit.
