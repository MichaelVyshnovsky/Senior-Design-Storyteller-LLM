Lulu () was a hollyphant who served for centuries as the war mount and friend of Zariel when she was still an angel.
In her normal form, Lulu appeared like a miniature elephant with golden fur and rapidly beating wings.
She was extremely gentle and caring, believing in the power of friendship above all else. However, she could not abide seeing an act of evil done in her presence without retaliating.
Following her contact with waters from the river Styx, Lulu lost her spellcasting abilities, but was still capable of using powerful trumpet blasts against her enemies.

Lulu served as the loyal companion and mount to the angel Zariel for centuries. In the , she rode with Zariel and the Hellriders from Elturel for an invasion of Avernus in the battle known as the Ride. When Zariel was injured and faced defeat, she ordered Lulu and Yael to hide her sword so it did not fall into enemy hands.
When faced with a horde of demons led by Yeenoghu, Yael and Lulu enshrined the sword in a fortress of pure positive energy known as the Bleeding Citadel. The effort disoriented Lulu, who flew away and roamed Avernus for months. She then met the rakshasa Mahadi, who sprinkled water from the river Styx on Lulus face, causing her to lose her memories and many abilities, and handed her over to Zariel, now turned into an archdevil, as a gift.
Zariel, unwilling to harm her former friend, had her sent back to Faer√ªn, unharmed. Lulu spent years wandering in the Fields of the Dead, where she later met and befriended the tiefling Sylvira Savikas, a sage from Candlekeep.
