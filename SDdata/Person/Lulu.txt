'''Lulu''' ({{Pronounce|LOO|loo|refs=}}) was a [[hollyphant]] who served for centuries as the war mount and friend of [[Zariel]] when she was still an [[angel]].

==Description==
In her normal form, Lulu appeared like a miniature [[elephant]] with golden fur and rapidly beating wings.

==Personality==
She was extremely gentle and caring, believing in the power of friendship above all else. However, she could not abide seeing an act of evil done in her presence without retaliating.

==Abilities==
Following her contact with waters from the river [[Styx]], Lulu lost her spellcasting abilities, but was still capable of using powerful trumpet blasts against her enemies.

==History==
[[File:Lulutheguide.jpg|thumb|300px|''Lulu guiding adventurers through Avernus.'']]
Lulu served as the loyal companion and mount to the angel Zariel for centuries. In the {{YearlinkName|1354}}, she rode with Zariel and the [[Hellriders]] from [[Elturel]] for an invasion of [[Avernus]] in the battle known as [[The Ride (battle)|the Ride]]. When Zariel was injured and faced defeat, she ordered Lulu and [[Yael]] to hide her [[Sword of Zariel|sword]] so it did not fall into enemy hands.

When faced with a horde of [[demon]]s led by [[Yeenoghu]], Yael and Lulu enshrined the sword in a fortress of pure [[positive energy]] known as the [[Bleeding Citadel]]. The effort disoriented Lulu, who flew away and roamed Avernus for months. She then met the [[rakshasa]] [[Mahadi]], who sprinkled water from the river Styx on Lulu's face, causing her to lose her memories and many abilities, and handed her over to Zariel, now turned into an [[archdevil]], as a gift.

Zariel, unwilling to harm her former friend, had her sent back to [[Faer√ªn]], unharmed. Lulu spent years wandering in the [[Fields of the Dead]], where she later met and befriended the [[tiefling]] [[Sylvira Savikas]], a sage from [[Candlekeep]].
