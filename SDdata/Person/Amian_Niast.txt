'''Amian Niast''' was a prominent and ruthless merchant from [[Waterdeep]], active before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Sometime before 1372 DR, Amian Niast commissioned seven pieces of [[enchanted]] ''[[battle robe]]s'' for her personal guardians, enforcers, and mercenaries named the [[Seven Scourges]]. She successfully commanded the company and gained them notoriety and fear among the lesser merchants of the City of Splendors. However, soon five of the Seven Scourges grew exasperated with the woman's ruthless tactics and staged a coup. They slew Amian Niast, her son, and the two loyal Scourges, taking over the merchant's business.
