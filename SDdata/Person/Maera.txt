'''Maera''' was a member of the [[Company of the Anvil]] adventuring company in [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Maera was a lithe [[Half-elf|half-elven]] woman. She was exceptionally skilled with a [[whip]].

==Personality==
Maera was passionate and liked to be at the center of attention.

==Relationships==
Maera was the partner of [[Bramas Thorntree]] and, thanks to this, also the second-in-command of the Company. Her brother was [[Merap]], also a member of the group.

==History==
Meara and her brother Merap were old allies of Bramas Thorntree, like all in the Company of the Anvil.

In 1370 DR, she joined the Company, and together they recovered the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' from a long-forgotten [[dwarven]] tomb in the [[Starspire Mountains]]. They had been ordered to maintain a low profile and, on their return journey on [[Uktar 10]], stopped at the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]] for drink.

Later that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''Sondarr Scepter''. However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company. Maera and the others in the Company covered for Bramas and joined in the brawl, so that he could use this as an opportunity to escape with the ''scepter'', but the dwarves eventually caught up with him and recovered it.
