'''Selinor''' was a sage in [[Ordulin]].

==History==
Around [[1358 DR]], Selinor's area of expertise was the [[Elven Court]]. She often acted as an advisor for rulers who needed to negotiate with [[elves]]. The recent turmoil in Elven Court kept her busy for the next year. Selinor had five scribes who worked under her. Fees for her counsel were four times higher than normal. She also sold maps of [[Myth Drannor]] in her shop.
