Selinor was a sage in Ordulin.
Around 1358 DR, Selinors area of expertise was the Elven Court. She often acted as an advisor for rulers who needed to negotiate with elves. The recent turmoil in Elven Court kept her busy for the next year. Selinor had five scribes who worked under her. Fees for her counsel were four times higher than normal. She also sold maps of Myth Drannor in her shop.
