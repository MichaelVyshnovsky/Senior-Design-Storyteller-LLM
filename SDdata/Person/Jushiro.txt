'''Jushiro''' was a monk of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] in [[Kudoku]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Jushiro lived in the [[Konjo]] temple to the Path of Enlightenment in Kudoku until 1479 DR. However, after the magistrate [[Hiro Yun]] failed to destroy the [[Five Deadly Shadows]], many monks left and the master of Jushiro was defeated by a stranger that became his new master. Afterward, the monastery mysteriously started to fall into decrepitude.

Later, an adventuring party confronted and defeated Jushiro's master.{{Cite dungeon/195/The Five Deadly Shadows|1-19}}
