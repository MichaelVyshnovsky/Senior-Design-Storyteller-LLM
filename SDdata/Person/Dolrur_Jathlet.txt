Dolrur Jathlet was a young scion of the Jathlet merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR. He was one of a dozen young men, all brothers or first cousins, that made up the next generation of the prolific Jathlet family. They all pursued interests in business (legitimate or otherwise, some very risky) that would increase their standing within the family. When in their hometown of Delzimmer, they strutted about as if they owned the place, which was true to some extent.
