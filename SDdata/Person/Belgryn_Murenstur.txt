Belgryn Murenstur was a merchant of Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
He was the proprietor of Murensturs Imported Vintages.
One night in Suzail, Belgryn Murenstur was accosted by the blueflame ghosts Relve Langral and Treth Halonter, who asked him if hed seen Seszgar Huntcrown recently. Belgryn volunteered that the man was at the Bold Archer, a tavern the ghosts insisted he lead the way, despite his protests he was going home. Seeing their swords were slick with blood and there were bodies not far, he acceded to their demands.
He then led them to the Bold Archer under duress, but also under the evil archmage Manshoons remote mental influence, he reconnoited for them, under duress, that Seszgar Huntcrown had at least six bodyguards, plus many other nobles had brought a retinue. He was thanked Treth almost slew him, but Relve reminded him they needed to leave a witness.
