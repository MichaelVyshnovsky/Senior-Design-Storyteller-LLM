'''Harken''' was a [[priest]] of [[Ilmater]] in the late-13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''Blasphemers, suffer again under the blade of the Voice! Suffer!''|Harken, while [[dominate person|mentally dominated]] by the idol in [[Dorn's Deep]] in [[1281 DR]].}}

==History==
Prior to [[1281 DR]], Harken lived in an Ilmatari [[monastery]] that was located just outside of [[Illefarn]]. On that year Harken and the rest of his fellow clergymen had their minds ''[[dominate person|dominated]]'' by an Ilmtari priest named Poquelin, who in reality was the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]] in disguise.Belhifet is erroneously referred to as a demon in both ''[[Icewind Dale (game)|Icewind Dale]]'' and ''[[Icewind Dale II]]''. This is overridden by the later sources [[Dragon magazine 278|''Dragon'' #278]] and ''[[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear]]'', where he is referred to as a devil.

Mesmerized by Poquelin, Harken and the other Ilmatari followed him north into the region of [[Icewind Dale]]. They then traveled through the [[Kuldahar Pass]], losing many of their fellow clergymen along the way, and down into the ruins of the [[dwarven]] fortress [[Dorn's Deep]].

In the Lower Depths of these ruins he and four others instructed to guard the [[Magic item|magical]] idol inside what had once been a temple to the [[dwarven pantheon|dwarven god]] [[Berronar Truesilver]], with Sister [[Incylia]] stationed next to him. While guarding the idol they and the other Ilmatari were individually surrounded by a magical barrier. Overtime they watched as Poquelin became more militant and fascist, but the magic of the idol had them too enthralled to resist and made them believe his words superseded the gospel of Ilmatar. Those outside the idol's range tried to resist him and for their efforts were transformed into [[undead]] guardians for the idol, such as [[boneguard]]s, [[mummies]], and [[zombie]]s.

Eventually, a group of adventurers arrived that year and destroyed the idol, thus freeing Harken and the rest of his fellow Ilmatari from its dominating effect. Once freed Harken was in shock and repeatedly stuttered something about [[plate armor]].Harken's exact words were, ''"Cou... cout-t-ter... v-vam... b-brace..."'' Couters and vambraces were both historically parts of plate armor, specifically the forearms.
