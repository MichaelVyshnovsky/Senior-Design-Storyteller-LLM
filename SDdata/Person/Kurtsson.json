        "mainbody": "urtsson was a Vaasan wizard who lived in Innarlith on the Lake of Steam in the mid–14 century DR. He was a henchman of the Red Wizard Marek Rymüt.\nKurtsson was fair-skinned with blond hair.\nHe was intelligent and stoic. He found the weather around the Lake of Steam to be warm by his standards even on days when it was cold and rainy.\nHe was proficient with an axe. Among the spells he could cast were silence and animate dead, as well as various illusions, and he could create magical portals, including those large enough to move ships.\nHe became a henchman of Marek Rymüt sometime in the early 1360s DR. The latter sought to monopolize and control all trade of magical items or services within Innarlith and Kurtsson agreed to join with Rymüt for this purpose.\nHe was present in Innarlith at least as early as 1362 DR where he served Senator Meykhati as a mage. The latter had great interest in exotic things and thus had an interest in Meykhati as a mage from such a faraway place.\nBy 1364 DR, he had become a henchman of Marek Rymüt. Marek used him to kill one of his rivals in Innarlith on Alturiak 4 in that year. Marek went to the home of his rival Thadat and Thadat refused Mareks wish for him to join Mareks monopoly on magical items and services. Thadat kept sharp watch on Mareks hands to make sure that he wouldnt cast any spells in his presence. Marek obliged, but while the two were sitting there, a spell of silence fell over all of them and Kurtsson teleported into the room from behind Thadat and murdered him with an axe. He then disguised himself with an illusion to make himself look like a Chondathan thug and walked out after Marek had left.\nWhen Ransar Salatis replaced Ivar Devorast with Mareks ally Willem Korvan as the head of the project to construct a canal between the Lake of Steam and the Nagaflow, Kurtsson assisted Marek in supplying magic for the project, including the raising of dead workers as undead servants to serve as laborers.\nSalatiss successor, Ransar Pristoleph, later placed Devorast back in charge of the canal. However, when Devorast and Pristoleph were away, Kurtsson and Senator Aikiko came to the site and installed a magic portal on the canal. Pristoleph wanted to arrest Kurtsson after he did this.\nKurtsson was later captured by Pristoleph at the conclusion of the civil war fought between Pristolephs faction and Senator Meykhatis faction over control of Innarlith. He was sent with Marek Rymut and Senator Asheru to Thay to face punishment."
