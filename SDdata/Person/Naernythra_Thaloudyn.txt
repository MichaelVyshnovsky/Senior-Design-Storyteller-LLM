Naernythra Thaloudyn was a human wizard and a member of the Heralds of Faer√ªn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She was one of the leading High Heralds, holding the office of Crescentcoat.
She made her home in Moonrise Towers, a fortified compound. It lay in the Western Heartlands, beside the River Chionthar west of Elturel.
As Crescentcoat, Naernythra was primarily responsible for training the local Heralds and was also given the difficult task of presenting all sides of issues brought up for debate among the High Heralds. Hence, they had to be a thorough researcher and debater.
In her position as Crescentcoat, Naernythra wore a beautiful cloth-of-silver tabard woven with a pattern of interlocking crescent moons, for which the office was na,ed. In addition to a regal appearance, the garment gave the wearer the power of a ring of shooting stars. The rod of office was made of ivory enchanted to be harder than adamantine and with the same function as a rod of smiting.
She held her office by 1368 DR.
