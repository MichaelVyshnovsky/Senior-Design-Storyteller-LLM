'''Naernythra Thaloudyn''' was a [[human]] [[wizard]] and a member of the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was one of the leading [[High Heralds]], holding the office of [[Crescentcoat]].

==Base==
She made her home in [[Moonrise Towers]], a fortified compound. It lay in the [[Western Heartlands]], beside the [[River Chionthar]] west of [[Elturel]].

==Activities==
As Crescentcoat, Naernythra was primarily responsible for training the [[Heralds (local)|local Heralds]] and was also given the difficult task of presenting all sides of issues brought up for debate among the High Heralds. Hence, they had to be a thorough researcher and debater.

==Possessions==
In her position as Crescentcoat, Naernythra wore a beautiful cloth-of-silver [[tabard]] woven with a pattern of interlocking crescent moons, for which the office was na,ed. In addition to a regal appearance, the garment gave the wearer the power of a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]''. The rod of office was made of [[ivory]] enchanted to be harder than [[adamantine]] and with the same function as a ''[[rod of smiting]]''.

==History==
She held her office by [[1368 DR]].
