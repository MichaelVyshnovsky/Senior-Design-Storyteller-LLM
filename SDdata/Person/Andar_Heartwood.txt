'''Andar Heartwood''' was the chieftain of the [[Black Lion tribe]] of the [[Moonlands]] in late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was under his leadership that the group of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s gave up on their nomadic lifestyle in [[The North]], and settled for a life of lumbering, trapping and trading within the settlement of [[Beorunna's Well]].

Although he was largely supported in this endeavour, there were still some within the Black Lions that felt they should not have abandoned the old-world life of nomadic migration. Among them was the more traditional-minded shaman, [[Patrevani Onehand]]. The [[Red Tiger tribe]] of the [[Cold Wood]] shared this sentiment, and the two clans had small clashes over the difference of lifestyle. 

Chief Andar maintained a private hope that his tribe would be admitted to the [[Leage of Silver Marches]].

==Relationships==
Chief Andar was protected by his ''sword-thane'', or personal bodyguard, [[Hask Bloodaxe]].

{{Quote|
“War with the [[Obould|orc king]] is coming. Every day it grows nearer. When it finally
arrives, it will sweep everything before it, like the waters of the spring flood. The Black Lions, too, will perish unless we plan for our future.”
