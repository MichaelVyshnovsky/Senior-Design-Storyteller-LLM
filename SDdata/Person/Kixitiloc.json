Kixitiloc was taken as a slave.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], he arrived in [[Ulatos]] the same day as [[Cordell]]'s forces arrived. He soon became a slave of the [[Golden Legion]]. Being a troublemaker, however, he was sold many times until he arrived in Lord [[Drakosa]]'s plantation. He hoped to improve himself to attain a better life.",
        "Personality": "Kixitiloc was a taciturn man with a bad temperament. He desperately wanted to be free but at heart he dreamed of becoming a master with his own land and slaves."
