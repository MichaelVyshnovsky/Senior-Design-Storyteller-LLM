        "mainbody": "Mayor '''Whimblesnort''', was a [[gnome]] who lived in [[Purfbin Doogrick]]'s home burrow in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Mayor Whimblesnort was in attendance at her burrow's annual [[New Harvest Festival]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. However, that year's event turned disastrous with the help of aspiring inventor Purfbin Doogrick. The Chief Cook [[Bitty Bitterbreath]] was convinced to let Purfbin present his latest and greatest invention, the [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]], to the adoring crowd of the burrow's important guests. The young gnome lost control of the apparatus, and instead of shredding a mountain of [[potato]]es for the famed [[Harvest Stew]], it moved to shred guests. Mayor Whimblesnort's new [[silk]] hat was the first casualty of the rampage."
