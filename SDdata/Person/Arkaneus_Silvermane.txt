'''Arkaneus Silvermane''' was the [[Archdruid]] of [[Mosstone]] and a member of the [[Company of Eight]] in [[Tethyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Arkaneus knew how to fight with hammer, [[dagger]], and [[Quarterstaff|staff]]. He could ride horses and knew healing techniques and how to tell the weather.

Arkaneus was a polyglot, speaking a large number of languages, including such rare languages as the tongue of [[manticore]]s and several dialects of [[Sylvan]].

He was one of the most powerful members of the Company of Eight.

==Personality==
Despite his great druidic powers, Arkaneus always adopted a low profile, rarely intervening during heated discussion between his companions. His patience extended to all areas of life.

He had never maintained a single absolute point of view of things but changed according to facts, being a cool and rational decision-maker without emotional attachment. Arkaneus believed his service in the Company was a means to confer balance to the chaos of his country.

==Relationships==
Arkaneus was attended by three apprentice druids, the married couple [[Leisha]] and [[Thastrun]], who were devoted to the care of [[Cayr Thalwood]], and [[Manfred Arbustle]], who in [[1357 DR]] joined the Company. He had great faith in Manny and trusted that he would find his way despite his struggles and would one day became his successor.

Arkaneus felt a close bond of friendship with those in the Company of Eight. Because of his coolness under pressure, [[Tardeth Llanistaph]] relied on him for good advice.

==Possessions==
Arkaneus' primary weapon was his ''[[Staff of the Woodlands]]'', but he also carried some throwing daggers and a hammer. He wore [[leather armor]].

==History==
Arkaneus was born in [[Mosstone]] and was tutored by Archdruid [[Tethirmin]]. Tethirmin wanted Arkaneus to be his successor, but Arkaneus was hesitant about this.

In [[1346 DR]], he joined the Company and became the longest surviving member after [[Tardeth Llanistaph]].

After fighting with the Company of Eight in the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Tethyrian civil war]], Arkaneus did in fact succeed Tethirmin, despite his misgivings. As Archdruid of Mosstone, Arkaneus also became a member of Queen [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda's]] Royal Privy Council.
