        "mainbody": "'''Kensidan''' was the son of [[Rethnor]], the leader of [[Ship Rethnor]] and one of the five [[High Captains (Luskan)|High Captains]] of the city of [[Luskan]].",
        "History": "Kensidan came to prominence in [[1377 DR]] when Captain [[Deudermont]] tried to free [[Luskan]] from the rule of the High Captains and the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].\n\nKensidan, a very scheming individual, convinced his father that at first they should make no move against Deudermont in fighting against the [[Host Tower]]. Later, when Deudermont had won and was elected governor, Kensidan made an agreement with [[Bregan D'aerthe]] for assistance, and his father fomented the fury of the people against the governor for a famine that plagued the city.\n\nFinally, Rethnor died, probably helped along by Kensidan. Kensidan started a open revolt that took control of Luskan and Kensidan himself killed Deudermont. Thus Luskan became, as Kensidan had always wanted, a true free port where it was possible buy all kind of tools, including slaves and drugs.",
        "Possessions": "The nickname of Kensidan originated with the ''[[Cloak of the Crow]]'', a magical cape that could polymorph a man into a giant [[crow]]."
