        "mainbody": "'''Gallow Deely''' was an adventuring [[bard]], active ''circa'' the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Gallow was a slender and lanky man who was not made for the adventuring life, but he often spent time with the heroic kind.",
        "History": "Gallow was the lucky owner of ''[[The Cittern of War]]'', purchased from its [[hin]] maker, [[Relias Blackseed]]. The bard often used the magic instrument to write songs about [[adventurer]]s and their grand deeds. He did, however, join the [[Company of Frozen Trees]] in the {{YearlinkName|1013}}, to face a young [[green dragon]]. ''The Cittern of War'' helped the adventurers defeat the wyrm, and the tale of the adventure became the song ''[[The Fight of Green Thirteen]]'' that remained popular into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
