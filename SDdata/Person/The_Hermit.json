        "mainbody": "'''The Hermit''' was a [[corpse tearer]] [[linnorm]] sage living in [[Narfell]] during the [[Rage of Dragons]] of [[1373 DR]].",
        "Description": "The Hermit was a gigantic linnorm, bigger than even a great wyrm [[dragon]], with dark, slimy scales covered in mold and lichen.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-25000}}, the Hermit witnessed the first [[Rage of Dragons]] and the fall of the draconic empires of the [[Dawn Age|Time of Dragons]]. He then pledged himself to the service of ancient dark powers.\n\nThe Hermit was living in the hills of Narfell with some [[undead]] servants. The [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] tribes saw him as a sage and treated him with great reverence and fear. They had legends about the foolishness of seeking its counsel, as usually those helped by the Hermit ended up cursed by him as well.\n\nAt some point before [[1373 DR]], the [[lich]] [[Sammaster]] sought the Hermit and defeated it in combat, forcing it to reveal all it knew about the origins of the Rage.\n\nIn 1373 DR, following the suggestion of some Nar tribesmen, [[Dorn Graybrook]] and his allies [[Karasendrieth]], [[Pavel Shemov]], [[Will Turnstone]], [[Raryn Snowstealer]], [[Taegan Nightwind]], [[Jivex]] and [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]] sought an audience with the Hermit. But the Hermit didn't want to become involved in mortal affairs and refused. After a brief skirmish, however, the Hermit agreed to help them and told them what it knew about the creation of the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]'': the secret [[elven]] citadel was built high in the [[Novularond|Novularond Mountains]] in the midst of the [[Great Glacier]]."
