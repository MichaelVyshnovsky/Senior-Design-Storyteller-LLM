Lysander IlArgad was an individual at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the late 15th century DR.
Lysander was bored and inquisitive. He did not enjoy the spartan rooms of the monastery and the lack of excitement found in the place.
Lysander was one of the guests at the monastery in 1491 DR. His job was to use the monasterys libraries to research various subjects for some Damaran nobles.
