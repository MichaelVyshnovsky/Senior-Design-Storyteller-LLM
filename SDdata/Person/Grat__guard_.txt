Grat was a city guard of Yhaunn in Sembia during the 14 century DR.
Grat had a gruff manner and unusually deep voice.
Around 1373 DR, Grat served as a guard for the city. Deployed to the Road Gate one evening, he and another guard met Keph Thingoleir as he attempted to flee the city. Skeptical of the young man leaving the city at night with bulging saddlebags, Grat was unwilling to let Keph through despite his increasingly frantic protestations. Fortunately, the priestess Feena Archwood happened to also be fleeing the city at the same moment and vouched for Keph, using her position as Moonmistress-Designate of Moonshadow Hall and threatening to have Guard Captain Manas summoned to adjudicate the situation. Despite the unusual circumstances at play, Grat choose to give Feena the benefit of the doubt and allowed her to escort Keph out of Yhaunn. Not too long after, Julith Harkspur rode through the gates to aid Feena, followed by twenty or so more priests seeking to capture Feena.
When Feena returned to Yhaunn at dawn the next day, Grat and his partner were still on duty, though they were too busy gossiping about the clergy of Sel√ªne going mad to notice her sneaking back in along with the morning traffic.
