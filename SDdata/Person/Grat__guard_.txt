'''Grat''' was a city guard of [[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Grat had a gruff manner and unusually deep voice.

==History==
Around [[1373 DR]], Grat served as a guard for the city. Deployed to the [[Road Gate]] one evening, he and another guard met [[Keph Thingoleir]] as he attempted to flee the city. Skeptical of the young man leaving the city at night with bulging saddlebags, Grat was unwilling to let Keph through despite his increasingly frantic protestations. Fortunately, the [[priestess]] [[Feena Archwood]] happened to also be fleeing the city at the same moment and vouched for Keph, using her position as Moonmistress-Designate of [[Moonshadow Hall]] and threatening to have Guard Captain [[Manas]] summoned to adjudicate the situation. Despite the unusual circumstances at play, Grat choose to give Feena the benefit of the doubt and allowed her to escort Keph out of Yhaunn. Not too long after, [[Julith Harkspur]] rode through the gates to aid Feena, followed by twenty or so more priests seeking to capture Feena.

When Feena returned to Yhaunn at dawn the next day, Grat and his partner were still on duty, though they were too busy gossiping about the clergy of [[Sel√ªne]] going mad to notice her sneaking back in along with the morning traffic.
