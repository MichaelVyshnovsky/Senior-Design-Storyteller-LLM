Imraphar Oromanche was one of the many Oromanche siblings of a prominent Mosstonian merchant family in the late 15 century DR.
Every member of the Oromanche family was described to have "dark, lush good looks," which made the family lush with rumors of and well-publicized trysts. The family was known for being flamboyant and grand individuals.
By the late 15 century DR, the Oromanche clan was one of the most successful merchant organizations in Tethyr and the town of Mosstone. Maerele Oromanche was the matriarch of the clan and the oldest sibling. The rest brothers and sisters were much younger including Elklund, Odyle, Olora, Emruelle, and Haladeira. Most contributed to the familys mercantile activities. Elminster of Shadowdale had a warm relationship with the family, but his attitude towards Imraphar Oromanche was notably cold.
