Ildamoar Hardcastle was the head of the Cormyrian noble Hardcastle family in the latter half of the 14 century DR.
He was a vigorous man even into his twilight years.
Ildamoar was staunchly loyal to the ruling Obarskyr family, especially Alusair Obarskyr. He had two sons, Guldrin and Rathtar.
When the "Devil Dragon" Nalavarauthatoryl invaded Cormyr in , Ildamoar was among the nobles who pledged troops to aid in the realms defense. He lost both his sons in the fighting.
Alusair Obarskyr personally informed Ildamoar of his sons passing, for which he was eternally grateful. The two became friends, with Alusair often inviting Ildamoar to parties with younger nobles.
