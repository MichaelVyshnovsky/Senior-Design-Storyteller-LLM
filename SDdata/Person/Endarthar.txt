Endarthar was in wizard who lived in the Wildwoods mansion near Waymoot in 1367 DR.
Endarthar was a brilliant spellcaster possessed of a fierce temper.
After fleeing Tethyr, Endarthar defeated the wizard Orthaerus Manycloaks and took his mansion as his own.
He spent most of his time developing new spells and creating servants including griffons, umber hulks, and a few oozes and jellies.
Endarthar once aided the crown of Tethyr with his magic before civil war ravaged that land.
The ghost of Orthaerus still haunted Wildwoods, tormenting Endarthar at any opportunity since the deceased wizard could still cast spells.
