Badrazel was a male balor and the chief lieutenant of Kurgoth Hellspawn during the Silence of Lolth.
He stood roughly 12 ft (3.6 m) tall and sported enormous clawed hands and wings. Badrazels skin was a deep red and dancing flames wrapped around him.
Badrazel was especially hot-tempered and was known to engage almost any foe he came across, only backing off if he was sorely wounded.
A powerful tanarri, Badrazel possessed the full faculties of other balors of his kind. Notably, he preferred to engage foes on the wing and would enter combat with his unholy aura active. In battle, he relied on his whip or greater dispelling power to disable most foes. Badrazel would unleash his more potent powers of implosion and unholy blight against enemies that resisted him. If all else failed, however, Badrazel could summon more demons to his side.
Like others of his kind, Badrazel carried a flaming whip and a magical longsword.
Badrazel has a working relationship with Kurgoth Hellspawn but preferred to operate alone rather than with the rest of Kurgoths forces. He tended to operate more as Hellspawns personal "fixer" and second-in-command.
In 1372 DR, during the Silence of Lolth, the half-fiend fire giant Kurgoth Hellspawn invaded Maerimydra with the balor Badrazel at his side. While Kurgoth made the Coliseum there his base, Badrazel continued to harry those that still resisted the invaders. He patrolled the heights of the cavern and tested the defenses of Castle Maerimydra on several occasions.
