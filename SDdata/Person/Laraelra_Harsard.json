        "mainbody": "Laraelra Harsard was a human sorceress with minor magical powers. As of 1479 DR, she was the Blackstaffs Heir under Vajra Safahr. \nLaraelra was very thin, pale, and had long black hair.\nLaraelra was an idealist who cared deeply for Waterdeep and its inhabitants. She championed the causes of underdogs, including dwarves in the Cellarers and Plumbers guild who were discriminated against. Despite her independence, however, she was insecure and feared her fathers disapproval. \nIn 1479 DR, while exploring the sewers with her hired bodyguard Meloon Wardragon, Laraelra heard a womans screams. She was able to track the source to a house owned by Renaer Neverember. Laraelra, Meloon, Renaer, and two of his friends rescued the woman, who turned out to be the Blackstaffs Heir, Vajra Safahr, who had been kidnapped after the secret murder of Blackstaff Samark Dhanzscul. Laraelra and friends were forced to leave Waterdeep for a short time after Khondar \"Ten-Rings\" Naomal   framed the group for Vajras supposed murder. They returned to Waterdeep and Blackstaff Tower, where Vajra officially assumed the title of Blackstaff. Laraelra was accepted by the tower and made Blackstaffs Heir (chosen by Vajra over Eiruk Weskur), allowing her to carry and wield a Blackstaff and channel Vajras power through it.\nLaraelra was the daughter of the guildmaster of the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild, Malaerigo Harsard. As such, she had detailed knowledge of the sewers and tunnels underneath Waterdeep."
