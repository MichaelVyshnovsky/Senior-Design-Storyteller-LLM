        "mainbody": "'''Laraelra Harsard''' was a [[human]] [[sorceress]] with minor [[magic]]al powers. As of [[1479 DR]], she was the [[Blackstaff]]'s Heir under [[Vajra Safahr]].",
        "Description": "Laraelra was very thin, pale, and had long black hair.",
        "Personality": "Laraelra was an idealist who cared deeply for Waterdeep and its inhabitants. She championed the causes of underdogs, including [[dwarf|dwarves]] in the Cellarers' and Plumbers' guild who were discriminated against. Despite her independence, however, she was insecure and feared her father's disapproval.",
        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], while exploring [[Waterdeep/Sewers|the sewers]] with her hired bodyguard [[Meloon Wardragon]], Laraelra heard a woman's screams. She was able to track the source to a house owned by [[Renaer Neverember]]. Laraelra, Meloon, Renaer, and two of his friends rescued the woman, who turned out to be the Blackstaff's Heir, [[Vajra Safahr]], who had been kidnapped after the secret murder of Blackstaff [[Samark Dhanzscul]]. Laraelra and friends were forced to leave Waterdeep for a short time after [[Khondar Naomal|Khondar \"Ten-Rings\" Naomal]]   framed the group for Vajra's supposed murder. They returned to Waterdeep and [[Blackstaff Tower]], where Vajra officially assumed the title of Blackstaff. Laraelra was accepted by the tower and made Blackstaff's Heir (chosen by Vajra over [[Eiruk Weskur]]), allowing her to carry and wield a [[Blackstaff (staff)|Blackstaff]] and channel Vajra's power through it.",
        "Relationships": "Laraelra was the daughter of the guildmaster of the [[Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild]], [[Malaerigo Harsard]]. As such, she had detailed knowledge of the sewers and tunnels underneath [[Waterdeep]]."
