'''Bhyrindar "Silverhart" Tellynnan''' was a [[moon elf]] [[werewolf]] and, as of {{Yearlink|1374}}, was a member of the [[Vel'Nikeryma]] and leader of a cell of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] operating in the north of the [[High Forest]].

The Eldreth Veluuthra failed to ally with [[Turlang]] and [[Lossarwyn]], and this was attributed to Bhyrindar's impatience.
