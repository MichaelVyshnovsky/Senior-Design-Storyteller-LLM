'''Eramas''' was a [[tiefling]] woman who was exiled from [[Elturel]] along with others of her kind, and forced to brave the roads and wilds of the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Goblins. Druids. This grove is a death trap. Grab what you can and get out, that's my advice.|Eramas. }}

==Description==
Eramas had medium-red skin and two large black horns. She preferred to dress in padded clothes with leather accessories, which included a hood she used to cover her features. 

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, all tieflings in Elturel were cast out of the city, following the catastrophic series of events collectively known as [[the Descent]]. Eramas was among the refugees who followed the exiled [[Hellrider]] [[Zevlor]] and his allies. They faced dangers on the road in the form of [[goblin]] raiders and briefly found safe haven at the [[Emerald Grove]] druidic enclave. The druids were less-than-hospitable however, as some within their ranks sought to perform a powerful [[ritual]] that would prevent the teiflings from remaining within.

Eramas was distraught over the whole situation and sought to gather goods for her own gain, with no concern for others.
