Kriiador was a member of the Hammers, the personal bodyguards of the Marchion of Mirabar, Elastul Raurym.
He was described to be the "most loyal Hammer" by Elastul. The tough fighter wore full plate mail and fought with a longsword with a golden hilt.
In 1358 DR, Raurym encouraged Kriiador to accompany the prominent Heroes of Ascore.
