She was one of the proprietors of the Wyvern Watch Inn.\nAsanta was the daughter of Buldegas Mhaerkoon, and sister to Baerill. They chatted constantly and had noisy arguments.\nBuldegas Mhaerkoon was the long-time owner of the Wyvern Watch Inn, but following the devastation of the neighboring city of Arabel during the Goblin War in 1370 DR, Buldegas chose to relocate there and build a new inn. He took away his money and some of his best employees and left his daughters in charge of the Wyvern.\nAsanta and Baerill had recently taken charge by 1374 DR. They conveniently forgot Buldegass instructions about watering down the drink, and their regular banter and arguing was a popular form of entertainment there. This made the Wyvern more popular with patrons.\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryCommoners\nCategoryInhabitants of the Wyvern Watch Inn\nCategoryInhabitants of Wheloon\nCategoryInhabitants of Cormyr\nCategoryInhabitants of Interior Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Eastern Heartlands\nnx1orrp2hjyvblmgjwgnm3ibynzudns"
