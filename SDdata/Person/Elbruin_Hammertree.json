        "mainbody": "Elbruin Hammertree was an explorer from Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast in the late 13 century DR.\nIn the late 1280s DR, Elbruin led an expedition into the Earthspur Mountains in the Vast in order to look for a way around the Glacier of the White Worm. There, they encountered and destroyed a large insectoid creature that walked upright and was armed with a spear, which they identified as an \"ice daemon\". The event contributed to legends of the glacier being kept cold by fell magic."
