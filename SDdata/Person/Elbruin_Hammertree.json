        "History": "In the late 1280s DR, Elbruin led an expedition into the [[Earthspur Mountains]] in [[the Vast]] in order to look for a way around the [[Glacier of the White Worm]]. There, they encountered and destroyed a large insectoid creature that walked upright and was armed with a [[spear]], which they identified as an \"[[gelugon|ice daemon]]\". The event contributed to legends of the glacier being kept cold by fell [[magic]]."
