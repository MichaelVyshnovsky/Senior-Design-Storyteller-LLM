        "History": "By the age of nineteen, Renault followed his mother's footsteps, who was a renowned assassin whose name was only known to the most wealthy houses of [[Faerûn]]. Like many young professionals, Renault faced the problem of not being able to get a job without experience and not being able to get experience without a job. With his mother's advice, Renault took on an adventuring career to learn to deliver death to his foes while surviving dungeon delves.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century DR, Greenwood was among [[adventurer]]s interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed [[sorceress]] to retrieve the equally mysterious magical ''orb'' from its depths."
