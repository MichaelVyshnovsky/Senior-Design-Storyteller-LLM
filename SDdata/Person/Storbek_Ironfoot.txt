'''Storbek Ironfoot''' was an eager [[dwarf|dwarvish]] armorer for hire from the city of [[Neverwinter]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Storbek made a name for himself as a diligent worker, content with any task he was hired to complete. What he lacked in talent, was easily overshadowed by his desire to work. He made a living by selling his armorer's services to the adventurers and defenders of [[Neverwinter]].
