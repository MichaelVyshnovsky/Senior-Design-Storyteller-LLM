Huerbara was a malaugrym in the mid-to-late 14 century DR who became their Shadowmaster.
Huerbara was young and able with a bad temper.
In the , during the hunt for Elminster, Huerbara was speaking with Neleyd when the elder Bheloris approached them, proposing to hatch a plan together to increase the chance of their success in the hunt.
Later, during Dhalgraves absence, she was chosen by the temporary leader Milhvar to go with Kuervyn and Andraut to Silverymoon to kill Lady Alustriel Silverhand. However, they were easily discovered by the palaces staff and killed.
However, Huerbara alone had managed to survive and escaped and hid. After Dhalgraves death at the hands of Elminster, she was elected as the new Shadowmaster High with the support and teaching of Hulurran and Gathran and proclaimed she would move more carefully.
Huerbara was the daughter of Ahorga, a very powerful malaugrym.
