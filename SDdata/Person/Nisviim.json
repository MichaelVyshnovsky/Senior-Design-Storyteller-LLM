        "mainbody": "Nisviim was an arcanaloth enchanter who lived in Corpsehaven in the Blood Rift.\nNisviim served Inthracis loyally because he knew his true name (Gorgalisin). His master Inthracis was a clone and kept clones of himself in reserve in case of his death and Nisviim had orders, deep inside his mind, to awake the new body of his master when he sensed his death.\nIn 1373 DR, Inthracis was approached by the god Vhaeraun, who demanded that Inthracis kill the three priestesses who were candidates to become the Yorthae (Chosen of Lolth) Quenthel Baenre, Danifae Yauntyrr, and Halisstra Melarn. As a reward, Vhaeraun promised Inthracis a higher position. Inthracis entrusted his holdings to his loyal Nisviim and went to battle. After being killed by Pharaun Mizzrym, Nisviim awoke the new clone body of Inthracis."
