Lord Haverford Gist was a member of the patriar Gist family of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR, well known as a charitable nobleman in the Gate and beyond.
In the , as the armies of the Absolute ravaged the Western Heartlands, scribe Gallaher Brym and his family were among countless refugees seeking entrance to Baldurs Gate. Desperate for admission into the closed city, Gallaher penned a letter, sent via the Sword Coast Couriers, addressed to Lord Haverford Gist. The scribe offered his professional services and eternal gratitude if Haverford, renowned for his charitability, would help the family enter the city. It was unknown whether Lord Gist responded to the request or even if the letter was ever delivered.
