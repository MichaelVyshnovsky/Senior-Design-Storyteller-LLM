        "mainbody": "'''Geldin''' was a [[half-orc]] muscle of the adventuring company - the [[Lady's Lament]] from [[Waterdeep]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].",
        "Description": "Unlike his mate, Geldin respected law and order. He usually wore a set of [[leather armor]]s, and was armed with a [[short sword]] and a [[club]].",
        "History": "Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Geldin, along with his mate [[Khatja]], joined the Lady's Lament and quickly gained respect for their strength. The couple rarely talked about their past, but one thing was known about them - they have been ostracised by both [[human]]s and [[orc]]s alike.\n\nIn 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from [[Luskan]] to the besieged city of [[Targos]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]."
