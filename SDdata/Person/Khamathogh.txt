'''Khamathogh''' was an evil warlord in the [[Endless Wastes]] in [[1367 DR]].
  
==Activities==
Khamathogh had discovered an ancient [[elven]] magical sword, the [[Sword of Ages]], and thanks to it he gathered an army of brigands and monsters. Khamathogh had raided the borders of [[Narfell]] and [[Thay]].

Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]], fearing that the warlord could understand the true power of the sword against [[Evermeet]], hired an adventuring party, supported by her best agents, to infiltrate Khamathogh's headquarters and reclaim the sword.
