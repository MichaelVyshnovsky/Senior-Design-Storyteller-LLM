Khamathogh was an evil warlord in the Endless Wastes in 1367 DR.
Khamathogh had discovered an ancient elven magical sword, the Sword of Ages, and thanks to it he gathered an army of brigands and monsters. Khamathogh had raided the borders of Narfell and Thay.
Queen Amlaruil Moonflower, fearing that the warlord could understand the true power of the sword against Evermeet, hired an adventuring party, supported by her best agents, to infiltrate Khamathoghs headquarters and reclaim the sword.
