'''Jamalia''' was a [[gnoll]] official and Chief Scribe of the Regent of [[Hafayah]] within the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] in {{Yearlink|1367}}.{{AQ-time}}

==Personality==
Outwardly Jamalia appeared to be simple and honest. Yet she was quite cunning and able to skillfully manipulate groups against each other.

==Activities==
Jamalia was rare among the palace officials in that she was quite close with Regent [[Uqban]] and had retained her position for many years. Anyone seeking to curry favor with the Regent typically went through Jamalia for this very reason.

==History==
Jamalia was descended from a tribe of gnolls living in the desert.
