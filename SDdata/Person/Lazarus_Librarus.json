        "mainbody": "'''Lazarus Librarus''' was the proprietor of the [[Arcana Archives]], a [[magic]]al supply shop in the city of [[Saradush]], and later [[Amkethran]], in the realm of [[Tethyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Lazarus ran his shop in Saradush until the year [[1369 DR]], when it was besieged and occupied by the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Yaga-Shura]], and his [[hire giant]] army.\n\nDuring this occupation, a man named [[Hectan]] hired a thief to steal Lazarus's [[spellbook]] with the intention of extorting him for a ''[[scroll]] of [[teleport]]ation''. Upon identifying Hectan as the person responsible for his missing book, Lazarus readily obliged his request, but warned that Yaga-Shura had a magical barrier created around the city, which would kill anyone who attempted to leave by [[arcane]] means.\n\nThe astute shopkeeper survived the assault of the fire giant army and eventually relocated to a much smaller locale, in the village of Amkethran."
