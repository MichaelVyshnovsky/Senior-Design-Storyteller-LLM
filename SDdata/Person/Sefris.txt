Sefris was an adventuring wizard and member of the Red Wizards who traveled across the Sword Coast in search of arcane knowledge.
She specialized in the school of necromancy, having studied with her fellow Red Wizards in Thay.
Sefris disagreed with the commonly-held belief that the school of necromancy was inherently evil. She worked with the powers of the dead to bolster the life force of her allies. As such she was exceptionally loyal to her friends and traveling companions.
She was a member of an adventuring band along with the elven paladin Galea, the tiefling warlock Prosper, and the dragonborn barbarian Vrondiss.
