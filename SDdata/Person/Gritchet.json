        "mainbody": "'''Gritchet''' was a [[halfling]] trickster in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1479 DR]].",
        "History": "In 1479 DR, Gritchet went to Waterdeep from [[Amn]] in search of a job. Gritchet found no job but [[Enda Yate]] offered to let him join in her treasure's hunt into [[Undermountain]] and he accepted like many others.\n\nWhen they ventured into Undermountain, Gritchet was chosen along with the [[human]] lowlife knee-breakers [[Cobb]] and [[Draskar]] and the [[half-elf]] market grifter [[Tindel]] to remain to watch their base while all the others led by Enda went deeper. He was shocked when his companions exploring the surrounding area slaughtered some nearby [[Downshadow]] folks.",
        "Personality": "Gritchet was squeamish about killing and always tried to avoid death even among enemies.",
