        "mainbody": "'''Symeera of Neverwinter''' was a [[human]] [[mage]] who owned a rooming house in [[Menzoberranzan]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "She was always cheerful,",
        "Activities": "Her rooming house&mdash;simply called [[Symeera's]]&mdash;was of good quality but otherwise unremarkable. She catered mostly to non-[[drow]] visitors to the city, and had many mercantile connections that allowed her to discreetly acquire just about anything for [[adventurer]]s from the surface, including [[magic items]], [[potion]]s, [[weapon]]s, and other equipment.",
        "History": "Symeera had formerly been an adventurer and a mid-ranking member of the [[Order of the Many-Starred Cloak]] in [[Neverwinter]]. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, she arrived in Menzoberranzan accidentally as a result of a faulty ''[[teleport]]'' spell, which delivered her into the [[Dark Dominion]] on the city's outskirts. Rather than seek to escape, she chose to settle down. By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, her rooming house in [[Eastmyr]] had become known as one of the best places for surface visitors&mdash;especially adventurers&mdash;to stay."
