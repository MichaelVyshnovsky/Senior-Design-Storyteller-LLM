Circa the , she arrived in Menzoberranzan accidentally as a result of a faulty teleport spell, which delivered her into the Dark Dominion on the citys outskirts. Rather than seek to escape, she chose to settle down. By the , her rooming house in Eastmyr had become known as one of the best places for surface visitors&mdashespecially adventurers&mdashto stay."
