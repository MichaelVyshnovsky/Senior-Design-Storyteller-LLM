Almari bint-Kafira, or the Shark of Suq Bay, was a notorious Zakharan pirate in 1367 DR.
She flew under a flag depicting a black hammerhead shark on a sea-green background. The sight of this flag was enough for most ships to strike their colors because of a unique deal that Almari offered.
Almaris pirate fleet consisted of five vesselsâ€”two galleons and three sambuks. Over 400 corsairs manned these vessels.
Unique compared to other pirates who favored absolute butchery, Almari preferred to rob a ship and let it go so she could rob it again in the future. Merchants sailing on Suq Bay knew that if they struck their colors and gave Almari a third of their cargo, then they would be allowed to continue their journey unmolested. Any ship offering resistance was rightly obliterated to the last man.
Almaris flag used to depict a shark jumping a ship, but poor artwork made the shark appear more like a dolphin. One brave ajami named Michal Bluestar taunted her by calling her the "Dread Porpoise." Almari was impressed with his bravery and offered to spare the wizards life if he promised to make her a new flag. Michal accepted the bargain and ultimately joined Almari as a member of her crew.
The Leap for the Throat was Almaris flagship. She communicated with the captains of the other ships in her fleet with message rings so they could coordinate their attacks and surround targets.
Almari was an agent for Prince Tannous al-Assad. The two communicated via a mirror of mental prowess held by one of her mages.
