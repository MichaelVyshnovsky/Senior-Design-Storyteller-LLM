'''Amaara Nharimlur''' was the fourth [[High Mage of Silverymoon]] She was one of the three women responsible for the creation of the wondrous [[Moonbridge]].

==Description==
High Lady Mage Amaara was recognized for her golden hair, for which she was sometimes dubbed '''Amaara "Goldentresses"'''.

==Abilities==
Amaara was a powerful [[mage]], with magics strong enough to take on a [[dragon]] single-handedly.

==Relationships==
Amaara was the daughter of High Mage [[Ederan Nharimlur]], a former nobleman of the city before assuming the High Mage's seat. Her mother was an [[elven]] princess and refugee from [[Myth Drannor]] named [[Elénaril]]. Amaara was their eldest child, and she had two siblings, a brother [[Elderan Nharimlur the Younger|Elderan]] after his father and a sister [[Lynnàsha Nharimlur|Lynnàsha]].

Amaara had been betrothed to [[Tilimarin Forestheart]], a [[half-elf]] like her, but he died three days before their wedding, and she never chose to marry another.

Amaara and her sister Lynnàsha were both very close with [[Alustriel Silverhand]], although most at that time knew her by a different name, that of Elué.

==History==
High Lady Amaara Nharimlur was born in the [[738 DR|Year of the Gliding Man, 738 DR]]. She inherited the seat of power of Silverymoon from her father upon his death in [[784 DR]].

[[801 DR]] was to have been the year that Amaara married her fiancé Tilimarin, but the captain was slain by a [[green dragon]]. Amaara herself took revenge on the wyrm, destroying it with her powerful magics and having its hide crafted into the border of a tapestry that she had commissioned in memory of her beloved.

In [[843 DR]], Amaara joined with Elué, her sister, and three other [[wizard]]s to craft the Moonbridge over the [[River Rauvin]], replacing the original stone bridge.

After a long reign, Amaara voluntarily stepped down from her leadership and passed control of Silverymoon to her friend Elué in the year [[857 DR]]. Amaara and her mother Elénaril journeyed far to the west to the island of [[Evermeet]], where Amaara become one of the few non-elves allowed to step on the island. She died on Evermeet in [[942 DR]].
