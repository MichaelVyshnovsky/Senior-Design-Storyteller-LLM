        "Description": "Asrigir was known as the Bearded Seer of the [[Moonsea]] to worshipers of the Lord of Battles. The seer wrote many texts that were collectively known as the [[Holy Texts of Asrigir]].",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], the Holy Texts of Asrigir were being carried by [[Graeme ibn-Naif]], a senior acolyte at the [[Vault of Swords]]. He was waylaid by bandits, and the sacred texts were stolen. The bandit group were found by another [[priest]] of Tempus, [[Tanareve]], when the group were about to throw the texts in the fire. Tanareve summoned a blazing spiritual hammer and attacked the group, who bolted away in fear. The texts were recovered undamaged."
