It's possible that some innocent people may be insideâ€¦\n|Nearby War Wizard}}\nKarie Leddle visited Wheloon alongside other Morninglords like [[Adara Semple]], [[Dai Rolno]], and [[Maribe Banro]]. She could be found at the docks of the Prison, preaching to (or shouting at) the nearby [[Purple Dragons]], [[War Wizards]], magistrates, and dockworkers about the mistreatment and innocence of those held within. She also worked with the [[Wheloon natives]] of [[Harvest Hall]], and knew ways to sneak into the city through the [[Wheloon/Drainage culverts|drainage culverts]] with or without the permission of [[Cormyr]]."
