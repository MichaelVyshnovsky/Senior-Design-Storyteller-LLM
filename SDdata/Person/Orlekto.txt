Orlekto  was a storm giant residing in the Maelstrom in the Trackless Sea during the late 15 century DR.
Orlekto was of the mindset that giants were chosen by the gods as the rightful rulers of the world and that their races loss of power over the centuries was simply due to inadequate leaders.
Orlekto was madly in love with Hekatons eldest daughter Mirran. This infatuation was so strong that he pledged sole loyalty to her, willing to both betray his king and tarnish his honor in her name.
Orlekto was one of four storm giant bodyguards that accompanied Imperator Uthor in the Storm Kings assault on Iymriths lair. He fought alongside Nimir, Shaldoor, and Vaasha.
