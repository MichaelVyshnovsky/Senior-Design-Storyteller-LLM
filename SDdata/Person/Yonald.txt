In {{yearlink|1374}} he agreed to take [[Ususi Manaallin]], [[Iahn Qoyllor]] and [[Eined Datharathi]] to [[Huorm]]; though the three of them were attacked by [[Xaemar Datharathi]]'s men, Ususi intimidated the man into taking them there anyway.{{cite book/Darkvision|124-125|13}}

He allowed Ususi and Eined the use of his cabin during the trip.{{cite book/Darkvision|127-128|13}} He kept some tins of dried fish in there.{{cite book/Darkvision|156|17}}
