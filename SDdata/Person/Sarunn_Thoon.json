        "mainbody": "arunn Thoon was a sorceress that ruled over Farkeep for a time during the Age of Humanity.\nShe was known as an especially cruel and cunning individual.\nSarunn took control of the Far Hills fortress by posing as a weak captive, and entering into the bedchamber of its lord, a man known only as the Wolf Knight. She took over rule of the keep for herself, for a time, proving to be far more malevolent than its previous lords.\nThe evil sorceress reign was put to an end however, when she and all of her followers were mentally enslaved by a group of illithids that posed as enigmatic, masked wizards.\nSarunns story was outlined in the ballad known as The Witch of the Far Cold Hill."
