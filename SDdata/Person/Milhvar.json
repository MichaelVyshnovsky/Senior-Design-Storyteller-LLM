        "History": "In [[Acheron]] in [[1358 DR]], just before the start of the [[Time of Troubles]], Milhvar took from the mind of the god [[Bane]] some secret information. Using it, he formed an alliance with the Shadowmaster High [[Dhalgrave]] in an audacious plot. He created the [[Cloak of Shadows (artifact)|Cloak of Shadows]], an [[artifact]] that made the wielder invisible from the [[Chosen of Mystra]]. Milhvar used his fellow malaugrym as guinea pigs to test the artifact against [[Alustriel Silverhand]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]].\n\nLater, he was among the malaugrym that welcomed the [[Rangers Three]] when they managed to arrive at the [[Castle of Shadows]]."
