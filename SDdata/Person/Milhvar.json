Using it, he formed an alliance with the Shadowmaster High Dhalgrave in an audacious plot. He created the Cloak of Shadows, an artifact that made the wielder invisible from the Chosen of Mystra. Milhvar used his fellow malaugrym as guinea pigs to test the artifact against Alustriel Silverhand and Khelben Arunsun.\nLater, he was among the malaugrym that welcomed the Rangers Three when they managed to arrive at the Castle of Shadows."
