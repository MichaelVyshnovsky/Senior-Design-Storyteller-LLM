        "mainbody": "'''Lord de'Arnise''' was a nobleman and the patriarch of the [[Arnise]] family during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was well-regarded by many for being a fair and just man despite his relatively moderate holdings.",
        "Possessions": "Among the lord's weapons and armament was a particularly powerful weapon, the ''[[Flail of Ages]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Lord de'Arnise helped instill a sense of moral responsibility in his daughter [[Nalia de'Arnise|Nalia]]. That outlook was not shared by the lord's sister, [[Delcia Caan|Lady Delcia Caan]].\n\nHe was well regarded his guardsmen, including [[Arat|Captain Arat]] and [[Glaicus]], his many servants and retainers, as well as the farmers who tended his lands. Lord de'Arnise counted many among his friends including [[Farthington Roenall|Lord Farthington Roenall]] and [[Hurgan Stoneblade]].\n\nHe had several pet [[dog]]s in his estate, Rex, Spot, Rover and Sparky.",
        "History": "Lord de'Arnise was born into a noble family that had a long tradition of martial skill and prowess. They were hospitable nobles who presided over their lands as the \"sword lords\" of old.\n\nAt some point he arranged for his daughter Nalia to marry the wealthy [[Isaea Roenall]] in order for the Arnise family to gain more status in Amnian business. He tried to stall the marriage for as long as possible.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}} the [[Arnise Hold]] was taken over a contingent of [[yuan-ti]] and [[troll]]s, led by a massive troll known as [[TorGal]]. Lord Arnise led a defense within the keep's dungeon for over two [[tenday]]s but was eventually routed by the trolls and slain."
