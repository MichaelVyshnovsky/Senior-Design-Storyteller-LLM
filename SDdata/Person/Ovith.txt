Ovith was a shadovar scout for Prince Brennus Tanthul.
In 1484 DR, Ovith and his fellow Cronil went under the orders of Brennus to search for the Abbey of the Rose. They were attacked by Vasen Cales party before they could find it. Cronil was killed but Ovith managed to escape.
He went back to Sakkors and told his prince all about it.
