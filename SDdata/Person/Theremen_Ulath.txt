'''Theremen Ulath''' was the lord of [[Deepingdale]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Activities==
Responsible for the Dale's defense, enforcing laws, and handling diplomatic matters, Theremen always used only the minimum authority necessary.

==History==
Around [[1349 DR]], Theremen was awarded the post of lord by the dale's council.

In [[1374 DR]], Theremen was contacted by [[Seiveril Miritar]], who explained about his crusade against the [[daemonfey]].
Later, together with [[Haresk Malorn]] of [[Mistledale]], [[Ilmeth]] of [[Battledale]], and [[Storm Silverhand]] of [[Shadowdale]], he formally met Seiveril for a high-ranking meeting.
