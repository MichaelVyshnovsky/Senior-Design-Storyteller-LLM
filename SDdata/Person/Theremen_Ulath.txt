Theremen Ulath was the lord of Deepingdale in 1374 DR.
Responsible for the Dales defense, enforcing laws, and handling diplomatic matters, Theremen always used only the minimum authority necessary.
Around 1349 DR, Theremen was awarded the post of lord by the dales council.
In 1374 DR, Theremen was contacted by Seiveril Miritar, who explained about his crusade against the daemonfey.
Later, together with Haresk Malorn of Mistledale, Ilmeth of Battledale, and Storm Silverhand of Shadowdale, he formally met Seiveril for a high-ranking meeting.
