'''Seenroas Halvinhar''' was the High [[Priest]]ess of [[Tymora]] in the [[Tower of Luck]] temple of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid to lateâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].Seenroas name is spelled "Seenrosa" in the ''[[The Savage Frontier]]''. In her prior appearance, ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'', as well as all subsequent appearances the name is spelled "Seenroas." Therefore, this can be assumed as a typo.

==History==
On the month of [[Eleint]], in the year [[1368 DR|336 NR (1368 DR)]], Seenroas ordered the young priest [[Adama Miiralin]] to set down an account of all the latest activity and news surrounding the [[Yawning Portal]] and [[Undermountain]]. As he had spent much of his time providing for the risk-takers who exited and sought to enter that dungeon complex.<ref>{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|15}}
