'''Druxus Rhym''' was the [[Zulkir]] of [[Transmutation]] within the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Druxus was a skinny, stork-legged man, with a weak chin and a bulge of flab at the waist-line. [[Tattoo]]s covered his body.

==Possessions==
Druxus wore many repositories of magic, such as rings, a silver-and-obsidian amulet around his neck, even the very tattoos on his body.

==Abilities==
He had only to concentrate for his magical repositories to release their magic and bestow upon him the strength of a [[giant]], turn his attackers to stone, or whisk himself across the realm to a place of safety.

==History==
An ally of [[Szass Tam]], Rhym was a major proponent of trade over isolationism in Thay in the early 1370s DR.

Under Druxus Rhym's leadership, [[Thayan enclave]]s across the Realms were selling ''[[amulet of resistance|amulets of resistance]]'', making them common items ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. These amulets were relatively cheap to make and provided the Red Wizards with a significant source of profit.

Despite his magical prowess, Rhym was assassinated on [[Mirtul 5]] in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, by an unknown assailant in his own bedroom. His replacement as Zulkir was [[Samas Kul]].
