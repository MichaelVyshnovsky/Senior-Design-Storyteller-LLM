        "mainbody": "Kharantes was a yuan-ti half-fiend who usurped control of Oreme in 1375 DR.\nA child of the Abyss, Kharantes was the offspring of a female yuan-ti abomination and a male demon. After reaching maturity, he found his way to Faerûn. His hubris led him to believe his destiny was rulership over all the serpentfolk of the world, and then by extension, the world itself.\nKharantes learned about the history of the sarrukh while on Faerûn. Feeling an instant connection to the yuan-ti, he studied texts preserved since the ancient days and came to the conclusion that the sarrukh had squandered their position of dominance in the world. The yuan-tis subsumed leadership of the Mhairshaulk Empire, on the Chultan peninsula far to the south, a sarrukh kingdom that the progenitors grew tired of and disinterested in, ingrained in him his notion that the yuan-ti were entitled to the mantle of ultimate rulership.\nKharantes discovered that, far to the north in the area that would become known as Anauroch, the sarrukh established the Isstosseffifil Empire. The city of Oreme was the capital of that realm. Kharantes studied carefully and discovered that Oreme was the repository of a vast magical knowledge, the Golden Skins of the World Serpent (the serpentfolk name for the Nether Scrolls).\nHis investigations led him to discover the location of Oreme and he entered the ruins with his entourage in 1375 DR. His cunning and duplicity allowed him to gain an audience with Oremes ruler, King Oreme, and poison him with a special toxin. With the king incapacitated, Kharantes took his own place on the throne. Soon after, Kharantes was deposed and defeated by an adventuring party in search of the Terraseer."
