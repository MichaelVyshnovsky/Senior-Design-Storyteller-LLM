        "History": "While being mind-ridden by the evil [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]] in late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}} during the lead-up to the [[Council of the Dragon]], Burrath guarded Lord Oldbridle during a dinner with a would-be noble and merchant, Andranth Glarvreth. Through him, Manshoon lied that there had been men following Lord Oldbridle in the street, which made Glarvreth's guards leave to hunt them down.\n\nUnfortunatelym, several men burst through the windows moments later, and the unguarded Lord Oldbridle was slain, while Andranth Glarvreth escaped down a secret passage. Burrath was able to slay his Lord's murderer before following Glarvreth down the passageway; there, Glarvreth told him that the man with a grudge against he himself was Kormoroth, whom Burrath had just slain. He then dropped a portcullis, barring Burrath from accompanying him; the bodyguard took a different path out the house.\n\nHe then went to [[Immaero Sraunter]]'s property, where he was drugged and slept on the man's bed, all on Manshoon's instructions.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|76-77|8}}"
