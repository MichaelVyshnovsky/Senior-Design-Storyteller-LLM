        "mainbody": "'''Ginia''' was a [[Courtesan (prostitute)|courtesan]] under Lady [[Galvena]] in [[Brynnlaw]] and sister to [[Ason]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "She was a young girl who was driven out of her home, and forced into [[prostitution]].",
        "History": "Ginia was raised in Brynnlaw since birth. Her mother died very early on, whilst her father was a tailor. Early on, she lived off fish and other produce from Brynnlaw, and was offered employment at the [[Spellhold]] asylum. \n\nAfter the occupation of her village by [[Desharik]], her father tried to re-enter their home. He was sentenced to death for breaking the law set out by the pirate king. Desharik told the newly orphaned girl that she had to pay for her father's crime, as his death wasn't enough. She was given to [[Chremy]], his lieutenant as a reward for his service.\n\nShe was put to work as a courtesan against her well, to cater for drunken pirates. If she refused, Chremy threatened to slaughter he brother. The only way she could escape the island was to be smuggled out.",
        "Rumors": "It was rumored that Ginia and her brother were eventually smuggled out of the island by [[Calahan]]. He agreed to take them to [[Ulgoth's Beard]], for a fee, where they would be raised by a woman named [[Therella]]."
