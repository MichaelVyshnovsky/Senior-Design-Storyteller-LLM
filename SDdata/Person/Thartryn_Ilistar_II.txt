'''Thartryn Ilistar II''' was the seventh King of the [[Ilistar Dynasty]] who ruled the city-state of [[Westgate]].

==Activities==
Thartryn became King of Westgate when he slew his cousin King [[Temprith Ilistar|Temprith]] in the {{YearlinkName|759}}. Thartryn then killed every descendant of Temprith's bloodline within their family, perhaps because Temprith stole the crown from Thartryn's father and banished him from Westgate. He ruled until his death in the {{YearlinkName|783}}.

==Relationships==
The simpleton [[Farnath Ilistar III|Farnath III]] was the father of Thartryn II and his twin brother [[Farnath Ilistar IV|Farnath IV]]. Farnath IV was suspected of murdering his brother for the throne.
