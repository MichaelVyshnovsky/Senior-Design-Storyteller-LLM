Lord '''Venali Starym''' was a member of the [[Starym]] clan of [[Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Born in the {{yearlinkName|111}},

''Circa'' [[650 DR]], Venali was the official clan heir while the proper heir, [[Josidiah Starym]], was missing.

He served on the [[Council of Twelve]] as a House Lord of the clan, from its founding in the {{yearlinkName|667}} until its end. Venali was chief among those who exploited their influence to acquire favored status for their house or clan in Myth Drannor's sister cities.

Thanks to the conspiring of Lord Venali and the Council and of the [[Guild of Wizards, Conjurers, and Enchanters]], the [[Ildacer]] clan lost their estates and much of their wealth, holdings, and status in the {{yearlinkName|704}}.<ref>

When Illitran passed and Venali became House Lord, he took up the ''[[Starym moonblade]]'', and wielded it passably well for many years.

At end of the [[Weeping War]] in the {{YearlinkName|714}}, when the [[Army of Darkness]] attacked Myth Drannor, Venali hide in the family crypt and worried more about protecting his wealth than the city. When the [[fiend]]s discovered him there anyway, he used the blade to [[teleport]] to safetyâ€”warped by the ''[[mythal]]'', his own cowardice and self-preservation, as well as a small part of his spirit, were imbued in the ''moonblade'', giving it the power to teleport itself and its wielder out of danger.

Venali escaped to Starym holdings deep in the [[Hullack Forest]] with his kin, of a strange wasting disease. The ''moonblade'' was inherited by his niece, [[Seldanna|Seldanna the Cold]].
