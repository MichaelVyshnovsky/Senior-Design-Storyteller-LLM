'''Athis Al-Din''' was the fiance of [[Sithal Al-Husn]]. After [[Habrauk Al-Nirin]] kidnapped the princess, he led his troops in numerous attacks against the Al-Alisk clan; he continued to lead the charge after his death.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}

==History==
The Sultan of Pazar married [[Sithal Al-Husn]] to Athis Al-Din, but the princess was stolen on her wedding night by [[Habrauk Al-Nirin]]. Athis Al-Din's family entered into a blood feud with the Al-Alisk clan, to which Habrauk belonged.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|124}}

The blood feud would continue to play out nightly until {{yearlink|1356}}, when the Princess' spirit was finally released by adventurers after Martek's crystal minaret. Athis Al-Din joined afterwards his beloved in heaven westward.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|125}}
