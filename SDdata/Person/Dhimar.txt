Dhimar was a worshiper and former high priest of Myrkul in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
While he had once been powerful, Dhimar received no spells from his dead god.
Dhimar oversaw the Temple of Myrkul in the Thayan city of Bezantur, and continued to maintain it long after Myrkuls death during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR. He refused to convert to the worship of Cyric or Kelemvor, and instead clung to the god for whom he had once served as a high priest. As of the late 1360s DR, he was believed to be the last devotee of Myrkul left in Faer√ªn.
