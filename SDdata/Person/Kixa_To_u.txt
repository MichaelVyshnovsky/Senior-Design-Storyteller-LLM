'''Kixa To'u''' was a great [[wu jen]] who lived in [[Koryo]] several centuries before [[1357 DR]].

Kixa To'u fashioned a magical [[staff]] of eldritch power, the ''[[Ky Trencha Ukang]]''. But he came to fear what he had wrought and split the staff apart, transforming it into five magical scroll reels.
