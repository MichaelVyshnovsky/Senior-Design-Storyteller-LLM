        "mainbody": "'''Nairith Irizar''' was an [[archmage]] and the sultan of the city of [[Volothamp]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Around [[1357 DR]], the [[galley]]s of Volothamp accidentally attacked a ship of [[Waterdeep]] while engaging pirates off the coast of [[Tethyr]]. As reparations for his city's mistake, Nairith Irizar traveled to the city of [[Waterdeep]] and gifted a valuable magic [[gem]], ''[[The Kiss of the Goddess]]'', to [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Open Lord of Waterdeep]].\n\nNairith's gifting of the gem was treated to a big ceremony at [[Piergeiron's Palace]] that was attended by Piergeiron himself, [[Madeiron Sunderstone]], [[Rulathorn]], and several of the city's prominent [[wizard]]s. The wizards in attendance included [[Khelben Arunsun]], [[Maskar Wands]], [[Nain Keenwhistler]], and allegedly [[Malchor Harpell]]."
