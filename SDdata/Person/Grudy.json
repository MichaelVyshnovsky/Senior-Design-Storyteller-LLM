        "mainbody": "Grudy was a lieutenant of the Cult of the Dragon circa 1369 DR during the occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, stationed in the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor.\nIn 1369 DR, Leutnant Grudy was under pressure from Brigadier Helmhorn over the members of the Sisterhood of Silver Fire who opposed the Cult of the Dragons operations in Myth Drannor. The women, referred to as \"fire witches\", became a thorn in the Cults side, provoking the ire of its leader, Kya Mordrayn. Helmhorn tasked Grudy to capture the Mystran clerics or have his bulbous nose sliced off."
