        "mainbody": "'''Grudy''' was a lieutenant of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] during the occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], stationed in the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]].",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, Leutnant Grudy was under pressure from Brigadier [[Helmhorn]] over the members of the [[Sisterhood of Silver Fire]] who opposed the Cult of the Dragon's operations in Myth Drannor. The women, referred to as \"fire witches\", became a thorn in the Cult's side, provoking the ire of its leader, [[Kya Mordrayn]]. Helmhorn tasked Grudy to capture the [[Mystra]]n [[cleric]]s or have his bulbous nose sliced off."
