'''Ash'ala Melarn''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[Lolth]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] and third daughter of the First Priestess of [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ash'ala dressed in the robes of her office.

==Personality==
Ash'ala could be influenced by those who showed they believed that her way was the right way to serve Lolth. She appreciated citing historical precedents or showing devotion to her House.

==Relationship==
Ash'ala was the third daughter of [[Kyrnill Melarn]].

Shakti Hunzrin considered Ash'ala the most notable of the Melarn priestesses.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Ash'ala was her family's representative for an alliance with [[House Xorlarrin]] and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in handling a party of [[adventurer]]s. For the expedition, she asked [[adventurer]]s loyal to her house to perform a holy ritual in the outpost that was the objective of the mission. The ritual cleansed an altar to guard against taint from the Xorlarrin or Bregan D'aerthe drow.

After the adventurers returned from their first mission, [[Hoshtar Xorlarrin]] was invited to meet with members of the [[Council of Spiders]] by his cousin, [[Raelaryn Xorlarrin]]. At the meeting, a [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliance's hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliance's decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending adventurers to eliminate [[Valan Jaelre|the leader of the assassins]]. However, Ash'ala wanted to know if Hoshtar had willingly met the heretics of the Council of Spiders.

In the {{yearlinkName|1488}}, Ash'ala together with the upper ranks of her House attended her matron mother [[Zhindia Melarn]]'s meeting with [[Shakti Hunzrin]] to plot the capture or killing of [[Drizzt Do'Urden|Drizzt]] and [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]].

However, secretly supporting her mother [[Kyrnill Melarn|Kyrnill]] against Zhindia, Ash'ala spied on her own House, divulging information to [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. But after the last meeting with [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], Ash'ala was unveiled and captured by Zhindia, who sentenced her to a terrible torture: to be devoured by [[maggot]]s. Thereafter, she was considered dead. However, in the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, there was a meeting between Zhindia and Kyrnill at which the [[yochlol]] [[Yiccardaria]] had Ash'ala tethered by a spiked collar and constantly tugged at it to draw out little yelps of pain.<ref>
