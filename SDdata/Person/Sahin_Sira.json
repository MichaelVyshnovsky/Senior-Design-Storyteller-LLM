She despised her husband and wanted nothing more than to hide from him and be left alone.\nAccording to legends among the jann and the Al-Badia nomads, Sahin Sira made for her the All-Knowing Eye, an  artifact of great vision, divination, and detection, so that she might look upon the vastness of his domain and fall in love with him."
