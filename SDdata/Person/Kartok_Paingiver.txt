'''Kartok Paingiver''' was an [[orc]] warband leader of the kingdom of [[Many-Arrows]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When the Many-Arrows orcs occupied the [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]]{{NWDistricts}} of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1470s DR, Kartok was among the warband leaders behind the takeover of the former Merchant Square. He based himself and his soldiers in the old [[Merchant Guild Hall]], which the orcs repaired and fortified.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, when the [[Neverwinter Guard]] attempted to retake the district, Captain [[Janros]] sent an [[adventurer]] to invade the [[guildhall]] and slay Kartok.
