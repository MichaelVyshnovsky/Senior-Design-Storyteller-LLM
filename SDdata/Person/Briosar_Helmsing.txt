Briosar Helmsing was a high priest ranger of Mielikki in the 14 century DR.
Between 1357 - 1367 DR Briosar operated a shrine to Mielikki in Waterdeeps Sea Ward that was known as The Ladys Hands. Around 1367 DR it joined together with the nearby Shrine of Silvanus to form a temple complex known as the Shrines of Nature, which he operated jointly with the other shrines high priest, Anarakin Iriboar.The Shrines of Nature first appear in the City of Splendors (boxed set), which is set during 1367 DR. Preceding sourcebooks City System (1357 DR), Waterdeep and the North, (also 1357 DR), The Savage Frontier (1358 DR), and Volos Guide to Waterdeep (1363 - 1367 DR) all feature the shrines within it as separate and unrelated structures.
