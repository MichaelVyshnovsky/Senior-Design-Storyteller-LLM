'''Elbereth''' was an [[elf]] [[fighter]] and the prince and later king of [[Shilmista]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relations==
He was the son of King [[Galladel]]

==Description==
Elbereth was almost {{SI|6|feet|long=yes}} tall and weighed approximately {{SI|130|lb|k|long=yes}},<ref group="note">Cadderly is described as being "at least 70 pounds" heavier than the elf. Cadderly's weight is recorded as just under 200 pounds, which puts Elbereth at 130 pounds, at most. with striking black hair and piercing silver eyes that were "almost eerie".<ref><ref>

==Abilities==
Elbereth was an accomplished sword-fighter and archer, being talented with both [[longsword]] and [[longbow]]. He was equally good at archery from horseback as he was on foot.

==Personality==
He was courageous in combat and fought vengefully against the elves' enemies.

==Possessions==
He owned a ''+3 [[longsword]] of [[sharpness]]'', the blade of which glowed with blue flame.

He had a powerful steed named [[Temmerisa]].

==History==
Upon the invasion by forces of [[Castle Trinity]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, [[Shayleigh]] urged King Galladel to perform the ancient ritual of ''[[Daoine Teague Feer]]''. But he rejected the notion, thinking it a waste of time and that it had no chance of working. Shayleigh told Elbereth and he also called for it. His father begrudgingly allowed Elbereth to do it. Elbereth successfully performed the ceremony, causing the trees to aid the elves of Shilmista in its time of crisis.
