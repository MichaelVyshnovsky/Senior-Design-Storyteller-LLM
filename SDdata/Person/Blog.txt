'''Blog''' was a [[troll]] guard in the dwarven prison in [[Undermountain]] controlled by [[Horazak]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Blog was a huge troll even by the standards of his race. He spoke broken [[Common]] and took his guard job seriously.

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Horazak allied the group of marauding [[humanoids]] under his leadership with [[drow]] plotting against [[Waterdeep]]. Blog was among the monstrous humanoids who took over the ancient dwarven prison in the Underdark. Blog was tasked with guarding the storage room in the mines underneath the prison complex that held precious stones, [[ruby|rubies]], and [[diamond]]s that the marauders' slaves dug up. The agent of Waterdeep sent to investigate the sinister plot against the City of Splendors defeated Blog after the troll demanded a password that the adventure did not know.
