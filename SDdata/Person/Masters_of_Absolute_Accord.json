        "mainbody": "The '''Masters of Absolute Accord''' were a powerful and malevolent entity formed during the [[Spellplague]]. Those who were [[plaguechanged]] or [[spellscarred]] often received messianic visions from the Masters.",
        "Description": "The Masters were formed by the merger of four powerful [[Deep Imaskari]] [[wizard]]s, creating a bizarre quaternary being that was implied to be similar to the trinary [[sharn]]s.{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|58}} As a creature born of madness, merely approaching the Masters was extremely dangerous.",
        "Activities": "Although imprisoned within the ruins of the [[Lodge of the Retributive Masters]] near [[Deep Imaskar]], the Masters of Absolute Accord would reach out to manipulate nearby creatures and terrain. While they could not leave their prison, they could manifest [[humanoid]] spirits to go forth on their behalf, and could influence events in any [[plagueland]] or impart visions to any plaguechanged creature in all of [[Faerûn]], often instilling a sense that they were an entity to be venerated and sought out.\n\nAs a being of reverence for any who believed [[spellscar]]s to be a blessing, the Masters of Absolute Accord were nominally in control of the [[Order of Blue Fire]], and directed the Order's actions with the goal of spreading the Spellplague to civilized areas. Every member of the Order's inner circle could boast a visitation from the Masters in their dreams.",
        "Relationships": "The Masters would occasionally strike against Deep Imaskar, earning them the enmity of the Deep Imaskari [[vengeance-takers]] of the [[Lodge of Retribution]].\n\nAlthough both the Masters and the sharns were nominal leaders of the Order of Blue Flame, the sharns' commandments could be erratic and would often conflict with those of the Masters, sometimes threatening to create schisms within the Order.",
        "History": "The Masters of Absolute Accord were formed in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] when three powerful Deep Imaskari [[arcanist]]s were driven mad by the Spellplague and quarantined within the Lodge of the Retributive Masters, the then-headquarters of the vengeance-takers. Trapped inside along with a single elder member of the Lodge, the four powerful mages were melded together by the Spellplague, forming a single being of pure madness.\n\nOver the decades, the Masters of Absolute Accord would reach out to the plaguechanged peoples of Faerûn, becoming a mythical messianic figure. While many were driven to seek out and free the Masters from their prison, none seemed to be able to locate them.\n\nAs of the late 1470s DR, the Masters remained an active threat to Deep Imaskar, and were the primary foe of the vengeance-takers, who had reestablished their order as the Lodge of Retribution."
