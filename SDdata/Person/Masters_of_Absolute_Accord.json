        "mainbody": "The Masters of Absolute Accord were a powerful and malevolent entity formed during the Spellplague. Those who were plaguechanged or spellscarred often received messianic visions from the Masters.\nThe Masters were formed by the merger of four powerful Deep Imaskari wizards, creating a bizarre quaternary being that was implied to be similar to the trinary sharns. As a creature born of madness, merely approaching the Masters was extremely dangerous.\nAlthough imprisoned within the ruins of the Lodge of the Retributive Masters near Deep Imaskar, the Masters of Absolute Accord would reach out to manipulate nearby creatures and terrain. While they could not leave their prison, they could manifest humanoid spirits to go forth on their behalf, and could influence events in any plagueland or impart visions to any plaguechanged creature in all of Faerûn, often instilling a sense that they were an entity to be venerated and sought out.\nAs a being of reverence for any who believed spellscars to be a blessing, the Masters of Absolute Accord were nominally in control of the Order of Blue Fire, and directed the Orders actions with the goal of spreading the Spellplague to civilized areas. Every member of the Orders inner circle could boast a visitation from the Masters in their dreams.\nThe Masters would occasionally strike against Deep Imaskar, earning them the enmity of the Deep Imaskari vengeance-takers of the Lodge of Retribution.\nAlthough both the Masters and the sharns were nominal leaders of the Order of Blue Flame, the sharns commandments could be erratic and would often conflict with those of the Masters, sometimes threatening to create schisms within the Order.\nThe Masters of Absolute Accord were formed in the late 14 century DR when three powerful Deep Imaskari arcanists were driven mad by the Spellplague and quarantined within the Lodge of the Retributive Masters, the then-headquarters of the vengeance-takers. Trapped inside along with a single elder member of the Lodge, the four powerful mages were melded together by the Spellplague, forming a single being of pure madness.\nOver the decades, the Masters of Absolute Accord would reach out to the plaguechanged peoples of Faerûn, becoming a mythical messianic figure. While many were driven to seek out and free the Masters from their prison, none seemed to be able to locate them.\nAs of the late 1470s DR, the Masters remained an active threat to Deep Imaskar, and were the primary foe of the vengeance-takers, who had reestablished their order as the Lodge of Retribution."
