'''Vishva''' was a [[dragonborn]] member of the [[Platinum Cadre]], who became the leader of the order after the death of [[Patrin]] in [[1479 DR]]. Due to her faith in a [[dragon]] [[Deity|god]], Vishva was a ''thrikominaki'' (clanless dragonborn).

==Description==
Vishva had brown scales, and scars were she once wore her clan's piercings.

==History==
Due to her faith in a dragon god, Vishva had been casted out of her clan.

In 1479 DR, Vishva became the leader of the Platinum Cadre after the death of the previous leader, the [[paladin]] Patrin. Although other dragonborn shunned them, Vishva led the remaining members of the Cadre who still wanted to serve her country. 

She convinced [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]] to help the members of the Cadre by cleansing them of the power they had gained from [[Tiamat]].

When [[Khouryn Skulldark]] returned to Tymanther and warned them about [[Tchazzar]] plan's to invade the dragonborn nation, [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]] assigned to the Platinum Cadre the mission to destroy [[Gestaniius]] and liberate [[High Imaskar]] from her forces, so the Imaskari would lend their aid to the [[thymari]]. Vishva took part in this operation as one of the high-ranking officials of the Cadre.
