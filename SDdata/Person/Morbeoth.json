        "mainbody": "'''Morbeoth''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]] at the [[Temple of the Crushing Wave]] in [[Tyar-Besil]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.",
        "Personality": "Morbeoth was a proud and prickly individual. He felt that his mastery of arcane power put him above anyone weaker. He resented that a mere [[druid]] was chosen to serve as the Prophet of Water, and that an ugly monster like a [[sea hag]] served as the cult's second-in-command. He would waste no time agreeing to help kill the leadership of the cult in order to later emerge as its new leader.",
        "Activities": "Morbeoth was a great experimenter in the field of [[elemental magic]].",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], Morbeoth was in charge of the western part of the temple, where he had his workshop with some minions. However, some adventurers infiltrated the temple and confronted and defeated him and his minions."
