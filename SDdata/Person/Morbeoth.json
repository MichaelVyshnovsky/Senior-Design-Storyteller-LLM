        "mainbody": "Morbeoth was a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave at the Temple of the Crushing Wave in Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nMorbeoth was a proud and prickly individual. He felt that his mastery of arcane power put him above anyone weaker. He resented that a mere druid was chosen to serve as the Prophet of Water, and that an ugly monster like a sea hag served as the cults second-in-command. He would waste no time agreeing to help kill the leadership of the cult in order to later emerge as its new leader.\nMorbeoth was a great experimenter in the field of elemental magic.\nIn 1491 DR, Morbeoth was in charge of the western part of the temple, where he had his workshop with some minions. However, some adventurers infiltrated the temple and confronted and defeated him and his minions."
