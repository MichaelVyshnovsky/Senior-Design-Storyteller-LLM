'''Baltir Merivolst''' was the most famous commander of the [[Knights of the Flying Hunt]] in [[1374 DR]].

==Personality==
Baltir took personal care of the teaching of some of the Knights' recruits, knowing that it was vital to have a high level of training, like he had.

==History==
Baltir was a very respected leader of the Knights. His most famous action was leading a successful expedition against a [[Nelanther Isles]] pirate fleet in [[1367 DR]]. From that episode, his name became known—albeit barely—even outside his country; in [[Nimbral]], people saw him as a model of a fearless but sensible warrior and a true leader.
