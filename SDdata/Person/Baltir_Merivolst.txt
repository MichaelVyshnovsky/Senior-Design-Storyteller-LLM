Baltir Merivolst was the most famous commander of the Knights of the Flying Hunt in 1374 DR.
Baltir took personal care of the teaching of some of the Knights recruits, knowing that it was vital to have a high level of training, like he had.
Baltir was a very respected leader of the Knights. His most famous action was leading a successful expedition against a Nelanther Isles pirate fleet in 1367 DR. From that episode, his name became known—albeit barely—even outside his country in Nimbral, people saw him as a model of a fearless but sensible warrior and a true leader.
