Oren Yogilvy was a halfling musician in the Goldenfields in the late 15 century DR.
Oren resided permanently at the Northfurrows End inn. After becoming drunk, he wandered the fields in search of inspiration.
Oren was at the inn when giants attacked the city after 1485 DR.
Oren truly lived for and by his music. Sometimes he got into trouble but his music had always saved him from harm.
