'''Stonesmith Hammerhand''' was a [[dwarf]] noble and commander of the city guard of the city of [[Orvyltar]] in [[Ulgarth]] around [[1367 DR]]. Stonesmith was one of the few dwarven nobles in the kingdom.

Stonesmith commanded 500 men-at-arms and three cavalry troops, as well as the city's defenses. Stonesmith lovingly maintained the powerful [[ballista]]e mounted on the towers that overlooked [[Copper Bay]].
