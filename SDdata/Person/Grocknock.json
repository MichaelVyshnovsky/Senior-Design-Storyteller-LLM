        "mainbody": "Grocknock was an ettin and the patriarch of a family of ettins who lived near Harvestshield Mountain in the late 15 century DR.\nThe two heads of Grocknock hated each other, and would loudly bicker with each other. In battles, Grock planned strategy for the ettin tribe while Knock actually led them in battle, often ignoring the plan.\nGrocknocks family frequently attacked Snarlclaws gang of trolls in competition for territory. In the late 15 century DR, both groups were forced to serve Mrolgyets Legion, and their members were branded with the Legions symbol. On Mrolgyets orders to retrieve the Anvil of Dumathoin, Snarlclaws trolls were forced to dig a tunnel from Harvestshield Mountain into the Frostsilver Mines while Grocknocks ettins broke and extracted their teeth to force them to keep digging. Once inside the Mines, Grocknock deployed rust monsters provided by Mrolgyet to begin breaking through the metal doors that guarded the hidden forges deep beneath the Mines.\nDuring the search for the Anvil, a group of adventurers in the service of the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Laeral Silverhand, caught up to him and soundly defeated him in battle. They then interrogated both Grock and Knock, and learned about the plan to retrieve the Anvil. The trolls and ettins soon realized that Grocknock had betrayed them, and began to panic about the consequences."
