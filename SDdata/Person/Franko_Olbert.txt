'''Franko Olbert''' was a man from [[Nesme]] in the late 15th century [[DR]].

==History==
Franko born in Nesmè from an [[Uthgardt]] mother and a Nesmè man.

He managed to escape the fall of his home city in [[1484 DR]] after an attack by [[drow]] and [[orc]] armies led by [[Tiago Baenre]].

In [[1485 DR]], Franko plotted to gather an Uthgardt army to reclaim the city when Tiago found him and dueled with him for sport. Franko was defeated and eaten by the [[white dragon]] [[Amaunathor]].
