'''Korkan''' was a [[hobgoblin]] slave in [[Szith Morcane]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
 
==History==
Korkan was the head slave in the noble house led by [[Rilira]].

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], after the [[fire giant]]s occupied the outpost, Korkan and all the [[goblinoid]]s were seen as the lowest-ranked slaves. This greatly enraged Korkan.{{Cite adventurers league/Szith Morcane Unbound|22}}
