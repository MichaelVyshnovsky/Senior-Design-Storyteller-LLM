        "mainbody": "'''Sister Julia''' was an [[undead]] nurse who worked alongside [[Malus Thorm]], a servant of the goddess [[Shar]], of the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]] in the town of [[Reithwin]] throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Sister Julia lived in the town of Reithwin in the [[Western Heartlands]] before its fall sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. During that time, Julia and other nurses performed healing and other medical procedures in Reithwin's House of Healing. The nurses entertained themselves by making wagers on what sorts of foreign objects they would extract after being lodged in their patients' backside orifice.\n\nAt some point during the town's fall into dark worship of Shar or after the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] consumed Reithwin in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Sister Julia perished and was changed by the dark [[Shadowfell]] magic. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Malus Thorm and his nurses operated out of the House of Healing in the Shadow-cursed lands. They spent their unlives \"experimenting\" on innocents that either wandered, or were brought against their will, into his hospital. Malus attempted to teach his Sisters the finer arts of what he called surgery but was ultimately unsuccessful. Sister Julia's undead form was slain by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, her body unmoving in the House of Healing's operating theater."
