        "mainbody": "'''Ju-Hai Chou''' was the Minister of State of [[Shou Lung]] around [[1358 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Ju-Hai Chou was the model of a perfect career mandarin: subtle, clever and learned. He used his skills to hold his ministry together. However, if needed, he would use force without hesitation.",
        "Activities": "Ju-Hai Chou ably managed all fifteen departments of his ministry, plus all the Shou ambassadors to foreign lands. He also received ambassadors and emissaries from other countries. In time, he had managed to gain contacts and allies in most of the provincial and foreign ruling families.\n\nHe often worked with Governor [[Kawabi]] of [[Chou' Yuan]] province.",
        "History": "Ju-Hai Chou had, for a long time, ruled the most powerful ministry of Shou Lung. Around [[1350 DR]], he managed to install his protege [[Ting Mei Wan]] as the new head of the Ministry of State Security. This movement permitted Ju-Hai Chou to use the State Security's resources as his own. However, he did not fully trust Ting Mei; instead, he put a [[ninja]] in place as her secretary with an order to spy on her, and assassinate her if need be.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], Ju-Hai Chou used all his efforts to blame the disaster in Chou' Yuan on General [[Goyat Nagumo]] in order to save his reputation.\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], Ju-Hai Chou was concerned about the rise of [[Yamun Khahan]] in the [[Hordelands]] and agreed to conspire with [[Bayalun|Bayalun Khadun]] in order to kill him. He also involved War Minister [[Kwan Chan Sen]], who provided the [[hu-hsian]] assassin for the task. The plot failed, however, and Yamun decided to invade Shou Lung.\n\nAfter Kwan Chan was defeated at [[Tsen-Ching]], a tributary of the [[Sheng-Ti]] river, Ju-Hai suggested to the Emperor that he replace him with the general [[Batu Min Ho]], of [[Tuigan]] ancestry, and assign him the task of defeating the [[Tuigan Horde]].\n\nMeanwhile, there arose rumors about a Tuigan spy inside the Mandarinate and Ju-Hai spoke with Ting Mei Wan to uncover the spy. However, the spy was actually Ting Mei Wan.\n\nAt last, Yamun eventually offered peace in exchange for the delivery of Kwan Chan Sen and Ju-Hai Chou. Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] agreed to the terms and Ju-Hai, wanting to atone, complied.\n\nBatu, having resigned from Shou military over the death of his beloved, delivered Kwan Chan Sen and Ju-Hai Chou to Yamun. However, in the end, understanding that Ju-Hai was motivated only by love for Shou Lung, piteously executed him himself."
