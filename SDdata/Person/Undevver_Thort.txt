'''Undevver Thort''' was a wizened retired [[adventurer]] turned shopkeeper, living in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/430/The Harpers of Waterdeep|37-38}}

==Personality==
Undevver was known for having an odd sense of humor and a keen interest in new or strange [[artifact]]s. He especially took interest in any that had some sort of story attached to them.

==Possessions==
He was regularly seen walking around with and leaning upon a [[cane]], which some local rumors suggested was "more than just a cane".

==Activities==
Beginning sometime after the rampage of the [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] in [[1385 DR]], Undevver lived in and ran the curios shop [[Thort's Findings]] out of the head of what once was the Walking Statue known as the [[Swordmaiden]]. He displayed the items in his shop with little placards written in his beautiful, flowing handwriting.

==Relationships==
Undevver was an ally of the [[Harpers]] organization. To aid their cause, he decked his shop out with hidden rooms to serve as safe-houses for Harper agents or Harper contacts.
