Brown Maeve was the Royal Magister of Ankhapur
Maeve really loved drinking too much, to the point that her sanity was in decline. She liked to listen to sad stories, more so if they came with a free drink.
Maeve was a wizard in Elturel. She joined Pinchs thieves guild. Maeve often partnered with Sprite-Heels, posing together as mother and child. She usually checked a place first to unveil magic protections. However, her drunkenness ruined some missions and Pinch considered getting her dried out at the first opportunity.
Maeve was one of the thieves that followed her boss back to Ankhapur to regain his body.
