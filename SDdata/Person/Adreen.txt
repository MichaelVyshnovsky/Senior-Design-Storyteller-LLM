Adreen was a human merchant in Mantol-Derith in 1479 DR.
Adreen usually sold exotic pets. She normally danced around her stall, talking and singing to the animals. She normally sold nothing however.
Adreen seemed totally oblivious to the dangers of the Underdark, and she did not really care about selling anything.
