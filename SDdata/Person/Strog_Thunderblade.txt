Strog Thunderblade was the military leader of Goldenfields sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
Strog was the leader of the military force of Goldenfields. However, thanks to all the local good foods and beer, he became very lazy, waking up late in the morning and falling asleep very early.
Strog was an easygoing individual, loved by the abbot Ellardin Darovik for this reason.
