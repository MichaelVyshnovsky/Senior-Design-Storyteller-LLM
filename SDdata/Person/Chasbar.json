        "mainbody": "'''Chasbar''' was one of the [[Sardonyx Knights of Grumbar]] who was attempting to wrestle the ownership of the temple of [[Myrkul]] in [[Undermountain]] from the dead god's [[cleric]]s and [[wizard]]s in [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], Chasbar and a few of his fellow Sardonyx Knights attempted to take over the temple of Myrkul and partially succeeded in the task. One of the [[gargoyle]]s that was serving [[Grumbar]], was placed as a sentinel inside the disputed temple. The gargoyle, [[Mikreava]] was guarding the shrine of Grumbar set there by the Sardonyx Knights, but eventually decided against serving the elemental god and focused on its eating habits that included [[humanoids]] and the servants of Grumbar. Ultimately, the temple was visited by an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]], tasked with finding the ''[[Black Wand of Myrkul]]''. The adventurer met both Chasbar and Mikreava, with both individuals asking the hero to kill the other one."
