==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Eryk left the Gate to adventure. In a letter, he reported back to Thomas C. Quirkilious that he recently met a [[janni]] trader, who introduced a rare metal to him, called [[pyrohydram]]. Eryk was told that the metal was used to craft quality [[pipes]] that had a "sonorous and grandiose timbre." He believed that Thomas could craft some masterwork [[flute]]s using pyrohydram, so he purchased a bagful of samples to bring back to Baldur's Gate.
