        "History": "Hanovar was one of the renegades living in the [[human]] quarter of Nexal in [[1362 DR]]. That year, after [[Millos]], the barkeep of [[The Death's Head]] bar, was sacrificed to [[Zaltec]], Hanovar took control of the bar.\n\nAfterward, he spoke with [[Ironspike]], a former acquaintance of Millos, and an adventuring party hired by [[Drakosa]] to find the [[Cloak of One Plume]] for the right price. However, soon after, a patrol of [[Viperhands]] [[orc]]s entered the bar with the intent to kill all people present."
