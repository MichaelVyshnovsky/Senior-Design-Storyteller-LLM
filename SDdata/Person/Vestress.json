        "Description": "Vestress dressed elegantly, with [[amethyst]] rings, lavender robes, and a [[silver]] circlet on her head. Despite illithids being very androgynous, Vestress had a feminine mental voice and moved with the regality of a queen. Her greatest hobby was weaving, and she could capture a person's soul and weave it into a tapestry, which she did to a number of [[sea elves]].",
        "Allies": "Vestress was part of the [[Kraken Society]]. She had an army with a core of 100 [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] under her command.",
        "History": "Vestress was a mind flayer living in [[Gauntlgrym]] in [[1278 DR]] when agents of the Kraken Society discovered the dwarven city and the illithid community living there. While trying to loot the city, they damaged the [[elder brain]] and escaped with Vestress as a captive. The Society later managed to brainwash Vestress into working for them.\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], Vestress served as the nominal Regent of Ascarle, claiming to rule on behalf of a [[kraken]]. She desired to conquer Ruathym, but the banshee made that impossible, so she plotted to have the banshee destroyed by [[Liriel Baenre]]. Under the Kraken Society, she also allied with [[Rethnor]] of [[Luskan]] and [[Shakti Hunzrin]] as part of a plot to turn the [[Lords' Alliance]] and [[Waterdeep]] into war with Ruathym. However, all of these plans were discovered by Liriel, who led an assault on the city, deposed Vestress, and released the illithid's captives. She was later slain by [[Azar]], a [[water genasi]] slave she sent to slay Liriel at sea."
