Hargrim Theos was a Doommaster of Beshaba who headed the Temple of Beshaba in Bezantur, Thay during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was a wicked man who found joy in inflicting misfortune on others.
Hargrim was an efficient leader. As the highest ranking member of Beshabas clergy at the Bezantur temple, Hargrim was perhaps the only one privy to all of the labyrinthine temples secrets.
