        "mainbody": "'''Igan Sokol''' was the quartermaster of [[Sokol Keep]] in [[Phlan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Igan was a scion of the mercantile [[House Sokol]]. He grew up in Sokol Keep and in time he became the quartermaster of the keep, which served as a lighthouse for ships entering Phlan. [[Harae]], a [[ghost]] that haunted the keep, somehow befriended Igan. Under Harae's hidden suggestions, Igan wanted to restore the shrine to [[Tyr]] inside the keep. He also involved in the matter his friend [[Grim Thornbuck]], the leader of the [[Knights of the Black Fist]] contingent on the isle.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|9}}\n\nOut of gratitude, in the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Harae directed Igan, Grim, and fellow Black Fists to a dungeon under the keep that contained treasure. However, when they arrived, Grim and his fellows were filled with greed and Grim killed Igan. This angered both Harae and the [[undead]] guardian of the dungeon, which had once been a temple to [[Dagon]]. Thus Grim and his fellows were trapped and besieged inside the room.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|5}}\n\nIgan was raised as a [[zombie]] to torment Grim{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|19}} until some adventurers hired to solve the mystery of the keep destroyed his mortal remains and sought justice for his homicide.{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|21}}",
        "Personality": "Igan was a naive individual. At first, he considered all the stories about ghosts and treasure as just a game. After he befriended0 Grim, he became more serious and in the end became obsessed with uncovering the story of the keep."
