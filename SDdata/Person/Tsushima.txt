Tsushima was a samurai retainer of the Korimori clan in Maeshi Province in 1360 DR.
Tsushima was ordered to lead a cavalry squadron to stop by any means an adventuring party hired by Michimori Uemon to retrieve the Seven Swords for Uemon. He attacked them but was defeated and killed.
Tsushima was a brutal man, who acted without mercy and fondness. He considered himself and his troop to be the best.
