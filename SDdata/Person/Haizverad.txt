Haizverad was a dragonborn of Abeir, and the ancestor of Clan Shestandeliath.
Haizverad was a slave of the dragon Versveshardinazar, who lived in the Dead Stone Mountains of Shyr. One day, while mining the remains of the primordial Petron in search of good materials to create magic items for his master, Haizverad found a powerful, yet small bit of Petrons lungs. Haizverad secreted it away and fashioned with it the powerful artifact known as the Breath of Petron,
Eventually, Haizverad became the posthumous patriarch of Clan Shestandeliath.
