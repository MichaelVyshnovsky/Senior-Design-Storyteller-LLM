'''Haizverad''' was a [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]], and the ancestor of [[Clan Shestandeliath]].

==History==
Haizverad was a slave of the [[dragon]] [[Versveshardinazar]], who lived in the [[Dead Stone Mountains]] of [[Shyr]]. One day, while mining the remains of the [[primordial]] [[Petron]] in search of good materials to create [[magic item]]s for his master, Haizverad found a powerful, yet small bit of Petron's lungs. Haizverad secreted it away and fashioned with it the powerful [[artifact]] known as the [[Breath of Petron]],

Eventually, Haizverad became the posthumous patriarch of Clan Shestandeliath.
