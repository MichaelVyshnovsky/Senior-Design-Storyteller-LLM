'''Husuf yn Harun el Halid''' was the [[Rundeen#Organization|Nirdey]] of the [[Emerald Ward]] in [[Calimport]] for the [[Rundeen]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
Husuf was the handsome son of a renowned moneylender of Calimport. He liked hosting extravagant parties in his palace. It was rumored that these nearly bankrupted his father. In truth, thanks to the Rundeen, Husuf had no economic problems. He worked for them for all his life and in [[1368 DR]] was promoted to Nirdey of the Emerald Ward. His main opponent was [[Nasim yn Nasim el Pesarkhal]], sultan of the Emerald Ward and nephew of the [[syl-pasha]].
