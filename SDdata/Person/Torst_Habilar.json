        "mainbody": "'''Torst Habilar''' was one of the Merchant Princes of [[Alaghôn]] in [[Turmish]] who lived in the [[1100 DR|1100s DR]].",
        "History": "Torst Habilar built his merchant empire and rose to prominence in the early 12{{th}} century [[DR]], during the time when Merchant Princes fought to claim rulership of the nation of Turmish. Habilar built his grand mansion in the town of [[Centaur Bridge]]. By the late-14{{th}} century DR, Torst's home was gone, swept away by some unknown event or consumed by some forgotten fire, becoming known as the [[vanished mansion]] of Centaur Bridge. Many legends claimed that treasures of Torst Habilar's mercantile empire could be found in the vanished mansion's cellars: exotic [[coin]]s, [[trade bar]]s, [[gem]]s, and antique statuary from the wars of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]]."
