'''Razaar Slissin''' was a vintner inhabiting [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==                       
Razaar was the guildmaster for the [[Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild]] ''circa'' [[1357 DR]]. He worked out of the [[House of Good Spirits]]â€”their headquarters on the [[Rising Ride]] in the [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]].

==History==
Razaar sent his spoiled son, [[Jurmin Slissin]], to present the Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild's [[zzar]] at [[Mossbridges]]'s First [[Annual Year-End Festival]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. The vintner hoped the trip would humble and mellow his pampered progeny.
