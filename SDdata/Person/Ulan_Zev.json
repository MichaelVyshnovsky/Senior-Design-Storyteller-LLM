        "mainbody": "'''Ulan Zev''' was an [[albino]] [[Red Wizard of Thay]] [[necromancer]] residing in [[Illefarn]] around [[1480 DR]].",
        "History": "Ulan Zev was busy doing magical research using as a laboratory the infirmary of Ironaxe Hall.",
        "Personality": "Ulan was irremediably evil. His dream was to become a [[lich]] together with his twin and serve [[Szass Tam]] for the eternity.",
        "Relationship": "Ulan was one of the four apprentices of [[Arvik Zaltos]]. He had an [[imp]] [[familiar]] always at his side and was very close to his twin [[Luuthgar Zev]].",
        "Powers": "Ulan and Luuthgar had a strange power: they had a very strong psychic bond and always knew each other's health. Most incredibly, if one of the twins died, his spirit could inhabit his brother's body like a [[phylactery]] and the surviving twin could grow a new body for the other from his own body."
