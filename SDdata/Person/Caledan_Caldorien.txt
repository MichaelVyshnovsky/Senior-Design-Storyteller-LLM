Caledan Caldorien was once a member of the Harpers and the adventuring group known as the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon.
In the , Caledan Caldorien returned to Iriaebor and found it under the rule of Lord Cutter of the Zhentarim and wanted to stop them. He reformed the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon, but when they were making their final plans to free some of the citizens of Iriaebor that were in the dungeons of the High Tower of Iriaebor, the mage Morhion "betrayed" them and ratted their plan out to Cutter. Cutter captured some of the members of the Fellowship and took them to the crypt of the Shadowking. When Ravendas took up the Nightstone, she was killed by its magic, as she did not possess the power of shadow magic. She was transformed, and the Shadowking burst out from her corpse. Meanwhile, Morhion cut loose the bonds of the Fellowship, as that was his plan all along. As Morhion did this, Mari Almaren threw her pipes to Caledan Caldorien, but Snake shot a bolt of magical energy to her, knocking her into unconsciousness. Kellen managed to kill Snake with a poisoned needle. With the pipes, Caledan played the shadow song, which was inscribed in Talfiric on the columns of the crypt, and the song tore the Nightstone asunder. In doing so, Caledan defeated the Shadowking. Afterward, the crypt collapsed, Ferret sacrificed himself so that the rest of the members of the Fellowship could escape.
While working with the Harper Mari Almaren, his comrades from the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon and his son Kellen, Caledan found meaning in his life.
