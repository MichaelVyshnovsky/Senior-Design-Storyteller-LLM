        "mainbody": "Khauldan Risimmer was a merchant lord, who possessed a seat on the Council of Lords in the city of Ravens Bluff during the late 14 century DR. He earned his fortune as a treasure hunter of sorts, by procuring rare and valuable goods and delivering them to buyers. Khauldan always drove a hard bargain and forced the more unscrupulous merchants of Dragon Reach to honor their sides of deals and bargains. \nHe was popular among the common folk of the Bluff, primarily for his practical insistence on simple, fair and honest business dealings.\nIn his dealings, Khauldan would specify penalties and punishments for parties on both sides of any given business agreement. If someone broke their side of an agreement, or otherwise failed him, he would collect what he was due with assistance of his group of fiercely loyal, 70-odd retired mercenaries.\nOn the council, Khauldan maintained suspicious of any merchants who rose too quickly and nobles who held their own interests above those of the cities. He remained vigilant against any treacherous or dishonest behaviors and possible schemes that may have laid behind any proposed law, debate or public vote. If his mercenary associates couldnt investigate any council member or noble with enough subtlety, of if the task proved too dangerous, he would freely hire adventurers so as to prevent any activities from being traced back to him.\nKhauldan had the appearance of a down-and-out mercenary, rather than a wealthy merchant. He had a large, bulbous nose full of warts and a rats nest of wild, gray and white hair. His hands were exceptionally large, more like a raking paw, and his joints were twisted and gnarled having been broken and poorly-healed, times and time again.\nHis face had a resting expression that was dour and stern, showing the years of battles that in which he had partook.\nKhauldan could not abide those who either parced out regulations to follow, when it was convenient to them, or those who used the specific language of rules and laws, rather than their intended spirit, to break oaths or otherwise not stay true to their word.\nOne on occasion, a thief stole some gold in a business deal, fled from Ravens Bluff and made it as far away as the Utter East. Twelve years later, two of Khauldans mercenary associates showed up at the thiefs door and politely, but firmly, demanded the gold they had stolen over a decade before, plus the penalties accrued over time. After the mercenaries collected the thiefs right eye, left hand, right foot and tongue, as well as the gold, they thanked him and left for good."
