'''Weichert''' was an awkward [[wizard]] inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Weichert struggled with the language native to Daggerford, and the Western Heartlands in general, much to the amusement of the locals. His native tongue was not used in this part of [[Faer√ªn]].

He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located on [[Kaoth Alley]] near the [[River Gate]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
