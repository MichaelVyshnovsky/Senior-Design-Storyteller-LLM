Weichert was an awkward wizard inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Weichert struggled with the language native to Daggerford, and the Western Heartlands in general, much to the amusement of the locals. His native tongue was not used in this part of Faer√ªn.
He lived in a house in the southeast section of Daggerford located on Kaoth Alley near the River Gate.
