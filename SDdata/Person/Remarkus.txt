'''Remarkus''' was an insane [[lich]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Remarkus haunted a kind of war room with a map of Myth Drannor around [[757 DR]] with pins indicating all the [[undead]] he controlled. If someone entered he called an equal number of undead and observed the battle, not caring who was the winner.
