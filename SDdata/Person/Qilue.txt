Qilue was a drow priestess, who dwelt beneath the female fighters society of Ust Natha, in 1369 DR.
She surrounded herself by many servants and guards, who would watch over her home.
Qilue possessed a very powerful enchanted dagger, called the Boneblade.
It was rumored that a duergar servant of an aboleth was commanded to ask an adventuring party to speak with his master. The aboleth was contained within a tank near the entrance of Uth Natha and wished for the party to slay Qilue and extract her powerful brain.
