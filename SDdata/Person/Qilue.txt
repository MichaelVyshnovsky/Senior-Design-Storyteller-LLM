'''Qilue''' was a drow [[priest]]ess, who dwelt beneath the female fighter's society of [[Ust Natha]], in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
She surrounded herself by many servants and guards, who would watch over her home.

==Possessions==
Qilue possessed a very powerful [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[dagger]], called the ''[[Boneblade]]''.

==Rumors==
It was rumored that a [[duergar]] servant of an [[aboleth]] was commanded to ask an adventuring party to speak with his master. The aboleth was contained within a tank near the entrance of Uth Natha and wished for the party to slay Qilue and extract her powerful brain.
