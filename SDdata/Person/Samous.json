Samous goal with the massive theater was to bring high culture to Daggerford by hiring skilled actors and singers from great cities such as Waterdeep. However, the citizenry of Daggerford showed little interested in such forms of entertainment and Samous was quickly forced to close the doors to the Grand Playhouse. He left the city a penniless man shortly thereafter."
