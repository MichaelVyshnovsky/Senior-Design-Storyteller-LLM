        "mainbody": "'''Samous''', whose self-proclaimed nickname was '''the Rapturious Songster''', was a maestro inhabiting the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Samous was famous for buying a large plot of land in Daggerford and designing and erecting a monstrous building called the [[Grand Playhouse]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}} Samous' goal with the massive theater was to bring high culture to Daggerford by hiring skilled actors and singers from great cities such as [[Waterdeep]]. However, the citizenry of Daggerford showed little interested in such forms of entertainment and Samous was quickly forced to close the doors to the Grand Playhouse. He left the city a penniless man shortly thereafter."
