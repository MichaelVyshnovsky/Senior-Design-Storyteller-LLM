Olsheirie was the name of the dryad mentioned in the Ballad of Starfall Pool. The dryad who lived in Starfall Pool glade would answer to this name, but her real name remained a mystery.
Olsheirie had long, flowing, dark brown hair, pointed ears, pale skin with freckles, and clothed herself in a forest-green dress decorated with oak-bark designs. She wore a garland of flowers and golden earrings and armband.Description based on artists rendering.
She was curious about the world outside her glade and would ask for news from any friendly person, especially Harpers. She loved to dance with guests, if they were willing. Unfriendly or hostile folk were not likely to see her at all.
The Harpers gave her a magic item that allowed her to cast a sending spell anytime she needed help. She had other magics hidden under her oak tree that she could use for defense.
If she liked the beings who rested in her glade, she would watch over them and their possessions while they slept, and warn them if any possibly hostile creatures came near.
She was friends with many Harpers and could call on them for aid. They would tend the glade as she directed and brought druids in to heal more severe damage. Her relationship with the mysterious floating shield that wandered in her glade was nonexistent.
