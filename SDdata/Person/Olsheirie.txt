'''Olsheirie''' was the name of the [[dryad]] mentioned in the [[Starfall Pool (ballad)|Ballad of Starfall Pool]]. The dryad who lived in [[Starfall Pool|Starfall Pool glade]] would answer to this name, but her real name remained a mystery.{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|74}}

==Description==
Olsheirie had long, flowing, dark brown hair, pointed ears, pale skin with freckles, and clothed herself in a forest-green dress decorated with [[oak]]-bark designs. She wore a [[garland]] of flowers and golden earrings and armband.{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|77}}<ref group="note">Description based on artist's rendering.

==Personality==
She was curious about the world outside her glade and would ask for news from any friendly person, especially [[Harpers]]. She loved to dance with guests, if they were willing. Unfriendly or hostile folk were not likely to see her at all.{{Cite dragon/296/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Starfall Pool|75}}

==Possessions==
The Harpers gave her a [[magic item]] that allowed her to cast a ''[[sending]]'' spell anytime she needed help. She had other magics hidden under her [[oak]] tree that she could use for defense.

==Activities==
If she liked the beings who rested in her glade, she would watch over them and their possessions while they slept, and warn them if any possibly hostile creatures came near.

==Relationships==
{{Fq|text=She ignores the shield, and it ignores her.|source=[[Horthil]] of [[Elturel]]|width=205px}}
She was friends with many Harpers and could call on them for aid. They would tend the glade as she directed and brought [[druids]] in to heal more severe damage. Her relationship with the mysterious floating shield that wandered in her glade was nonexistent.
