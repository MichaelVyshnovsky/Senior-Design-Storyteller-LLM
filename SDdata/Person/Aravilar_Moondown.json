        "mainbody": "'''Aravilar Moondown''' was a [[moon elf]] [[Knight of the Weave]] who served with the order during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was extremely dedicated to [[the Weave]] and magic throughout his years of service.",
        "Description": "In his younger years, Aravilar believed himself superior to others due to his [[elven]] heritage, and often spoke to others as if they were his lessers. While he was confident in himself to the point of being arrogant when he first joined the Knights, he had mellowed out quite a bit after spending time in the order.",
        "History": "In one of his first missions, Aravilar was tasked with finding and stopping a [[potion]]-peddler who sold magic items corrupted by the [[Shadow Weave]].\n\nSome time later he sought an ancient [[artifact]], dating back to the Empire of [[Netheril]], that reportedly consumed the Weave and spewed forth \"[[Elemental Chaos|pure primal chaos]]. He believed it resided in a set of ancient ruins that were protected by an ancient [[lich]] or evil [[phaerimm]].",
        "Possessions": "Among Aravilar's possessions were a ''+2 [[mithral]] [[full plate]]'' and a pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''."
