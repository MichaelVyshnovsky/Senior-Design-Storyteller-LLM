        "mainbody": "Aravilar Moondown was a moon elf Knight of the Weave who served with the order during the 14 century DR. He was extremely dedicated to the Weave and magic throughout his years of service.\nIn his younger years, Aravilar believed himself superior to others due to his elven heritage, and often spoke to others as if they were his lessers. While he was confident in himself to the point of being arrogant when he first joined the Knights, he had mellowed out quite a bit after spending time in the order.\nIn one of his first missions, Aravilar was tasked with finding and stopping a potion-peddler who sold magic items corrupted by the Shadow Weave.\nSome time later he sought an ancient artifact, dating back to the Empire of Netheril, that reportedly consumed the Weave and spewed forth \"pure primal chaos. He believed it resided in a set of ancient ruins that were protected by an ancient lich or evil phaerimm.\nAmong Aravilars possessions were a +2 mithral full plate and a pair of boots of elvenkind."
