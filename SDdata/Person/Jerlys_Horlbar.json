        "mainbody": "Jerlys Horlbar was the drow matron mother of House Horlbar in Menzoberranzan.\nJerlys was a beautiful female elf with smooth long legs and she would use her feminine wiles to seduce and manipulate her victims.\nAs a priestess of Lolth, Jerlys fought with an 8 ft (2.4 m) red three tentacle rod, which she could use with deadly force. Like many drow, she wore drow chainmail.\nHouse Horlbar was the twelfth ruling house in Menzoberranzan, and Jerlys Horlbar was one of two high priestesses of Lolth, the Spider Queen.\nIn 1357 DR, Artemis Entreri encountered Jerlys in the back alleyways of the drow city while he was appearing as a member of Bregan Daerthe."
