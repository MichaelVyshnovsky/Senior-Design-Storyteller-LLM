        "History": "Elthryn was a calm, peaceful, just man. At one point, not supporting the intrigues that plagued the court, Elthryn retired to the outlying village of [[Heldon]] and [[Uthgrael Aumar]] gave him the [[Lion Sword]], a [[longsword]] with magical powers that had never left the king's hand until then. Some saw this act as the king appointing Elthryn as the true heir to the Stag Throne.\n\nIn Heldon, Elthryn married a forester's daughter, [[Amrythale Goldsheaf]], in [[210 DR]]. They had one son, Elminster, born in [[212 DR]]. Both parents were slain in the destruction of Heldon by the wizard [[Undarl]] in [[224 DR]].<ref name=\"EtMoM-p272\" >"
