Irtana was the queen of the Kuro goblin tribe in Chult.
Irtana was a powerful fighter and gained her power through combat.
Irtana ruled the village with an iron fist but her village prospered under her rule with a constant supply of slaves and sacrifices. All who doubted her orders were sent as sacrifices to the dinosaurs. 
Irtana was cruel, enjoying tormenting lesser creatures and scaring slaves. However, she acted aloof and attentive with outsiders.
