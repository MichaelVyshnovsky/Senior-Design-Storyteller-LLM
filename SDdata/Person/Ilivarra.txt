==Description==
The drow cleric of [[Lolth]] had deep red eyes and several tattoos across her arms, chest and legs. Her black-red "[[armor]]" was quite revealing. She carried a large [[staff]] that glowed green-blue at its apex.

==Abilities==
Ilivarra was a powerful spellcaster, and was able to launch [[fireball]]s and [[magic missile]]s at her foes. She could teleport seemingly at will, as well as conjure [[undead]] to assist her in combat.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], Ilivarra led a legion of drow to exterminate the Bruenghor Clan. She did this to protect the movements of the [[gnoll]]s and [[ogre]]s that roamed the area, but this was all part of a larger plan. Though her legion forced the Bruenghor Clan out of their mines, and killed several of them, many of them escaped to the surface.

The three adventurers [[Adrianna]], [[Kromlech]], and [[Vahn]] gained access to the dwarven mines and fought their way through. They confronted Ilivarra, who told them that they would pay dearly for the deaths they had caused. They presumed that she ordered the attack, but in fact, Ilivarra cared not for the Sunset Mountains or even the cities of the surface. She claimed that they had been promised to others, and was surprised at the ignorance of the adventurers. Without saying any more, the two sides initiated combat. However, she was cut down, and the adventurers looted a [[Ilivarra's Horn of Sahri|horn]] used to access a cave, as well as a key to rescue [[Brogan]], a [[dwarf]] [[Harper]].
