'''Llendril Coe''' was an adventuring [[moon elf]] [[bard]] member of the [[The Winter Rose]] from the [[North Faerûn]].

==Appearance==
Llendril was a slender elf with pale skin who wore dresses and used a small [[crossbow]] in combat.

==History==
Sometime long before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Llendril Coe's ancestors lived in the [[Hand of the Seldarine]]. The citadel fell, and survivors scattered across the north. Llendril grew up hearing stories of her ancestral home and magical music that filled the Hand's hallways, and she made it her life's goal to return it to its former glory. Eventually, Llendril Coe joined an adventuring fellowship – [[The Winter Rose]] in hopes their quest would lead the group to the [[Severed Hand]]. Along with the fellow adventurer, [[hin]] [[wizard]] [[Dalwynd Meadsbreath]], Llendril kept the team's spirits high with jokes and music.
