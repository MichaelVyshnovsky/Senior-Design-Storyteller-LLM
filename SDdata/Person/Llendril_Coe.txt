Sometime long before the , Llendril Coes ancestors lived in the Hand of the Seldarine. The citadel fell, and survivors scattered across the north. Llendril grew up hearing stories of her ancestral home and magical music that filled the Hands hallways, and she made it her lifes goal to return it to its former glory. Eventually, Llendril Coe joined an adventuring fellowship – The Winter Rose in hopes their quest would lead the group to the Severed Hand. Along with the fellow adventurer, hin wizard Dalwynd Meadsbreath, Llendril kept the teams spirits high with jokes and music.
