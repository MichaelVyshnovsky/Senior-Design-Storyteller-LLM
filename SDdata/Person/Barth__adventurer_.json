        "mainbody": "century adventurer|other people with the same name|Barth\nBarth was a swordsman that hailed from the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had light skin, pointed ears, and light-brown hair. He often wore a green padded tunic with brown leggings.\nWhile Barth had something of a temper and did not abide coddling of children, he was actually quite sympathetic to the loss of others. He could demonstrate real compassion under certain circumstances.\nBarth fought with a sword and shield. Among Barths most cherished possessions was an amulet his mother gifted him upon her deathbed. The amulet was not an heirloom, but rather a trinket she stole while cleaning houses. Nevertheless, it still meant the world to Barth.\nIn the late-15 century DR, Barth adventured with Aradin and Remira. Their group was chased by Zakrugs pack of goblins towards the gate of the tiefling camp at the Emerald Grove, and were not allowed access without permission of Zevlor, the tieflings leader. Even though Zevlor gave the command to let the adventurers in, the goblins were already upon the gate of the grove, with Barth and his companions caught inbetween."
