The , is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the Cult of the Dragon for control of the helmet of disjunction. Sven, however, completely missed it, having stepped out of the bath that morning, slipped on a wet stone floor, and fell and hit his head, killing him. Nevertheless, he and the fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a sacred burial ground on the site.\nA century later, in the late 1490s DR, the body of Sven Salafin was exhumed by Edgin Darvis, Simon Aumar, Doric, and Holga Kilgore (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simons deathly token to speak with the dead, they questioned Svens corpse over the fate of the helmet of disjunction, only to find they had the wrong Salafin. Sven did ask how his brother was doing though."
