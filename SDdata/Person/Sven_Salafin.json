        "mainbody": "'''Sven Salafin''' was an [[Uthgardt]] [[human]] of the [[Elk tribe]] of the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}",

        "History": "In the conflict known as the [[Battle of the Evermoors]] sometime around [[1400 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The battle is undated but is \"a century ago\" from the date of ''Honor Among Thieves'', which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The {{yearlinkName|1402}}, is a likely candidate. the Elk tribe battled the [[Cult of the Dragon]] for control of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]''. Sven, however, completely missed it, having stepped out of the bath that morning, slipped on a wet stone floor, and fell and hit his head, killing him. Nevertheless, he and the fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a [[Evermoors cemetery|sacred burial ground on the site]].\n\nA century later, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the body of Sven Salafin was exhumed by [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Simon Aumar]], [[Doric]], and [[Holga Kilgore]] (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's ''[[deathly token]]'' to [[speak with dead|speak with the dead]], they questioned Sven's corpse over the fate of the ''helmet of disjunction'', only to find they had the wrong Salafin. Sven did ask how his brother was doing though."
