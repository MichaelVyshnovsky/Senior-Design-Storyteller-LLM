'''Victoria Onufrio''' was a "pureblooded" [[human]] daughter of the [[vampire spawn]] named  [[Leon Onufrio]], one of the favorite "children" of the [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]], who resided in the [[Szarr Palace]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Ever since the master Turned me and forced me to bring Victoria along into the palace, I've had to be his best hunter just so I could stay in here with my daughter and keep her away from the other spawn. I don't like the way Violet looks at her, not at all! When I ask the master what he plans to do with Victoria, Cazador just gives me that wicked smile. Next time I get out on a hunt, must talk Figaro to finalize the deal for Victoria's escape disguise. If only there's enough time before the 'ritual' the master talks about!''|Excerpt from Leon Onufrio's diary}}

==Description==
Victoria was a human girl with a light skin tone, dark brown eyes, and straight light brown hair.

==Possessions==
Her favorite toy was a [[Stuffed toy|stuffed]] [[owlbear]].

==History==
Victoria was commanded to be brought to reside in the Szarr Palace by her father's master after he was turned into a vampire spawn. Her well-being was one of the tools to ensure Leon's position as Cazador's favored spawn â€“ the status that allowed the human child protection from other vampires. Eventually, Victoria attracted the attention of [[Violet (vampire spawn)|Violet]] and [[Dalyria]], fellow vampire spawn. Dalyria became obsessed with curing vampirism, believing it to be nothing more than a [[disease]] of the blood. She developed a theory that the cure was hidden in a great amount of blood from a young and strong individual, one strong enough to overwhelm vampirism. She targeted the "pureblooded" Victoria, still just a child. Unbeknownst to Dalyria, Victoria had a powerful [[curse]] placed on her by her father as protection. Shortly before the child's death, her father was trying to acquire a quality disguise from [[Figaro Pennygood]] of [[Facemaker's Boutique]] to smuggle her out of the vampire lord's domain. Her father also gave her a copy of [[Kozakuran Dictionary]] so the child could learn the words of Kazador's magic that sealed the palace and allowed her to escape if needed. But she was found out and returned to the palace by Dalyria. When Dalyria attempted to drain the child, the curse activated. Dalyria was found puking the cursed blood when Cazador discovered her plan and dragged her away to be punished. The child's body was left in Leon Onufrio's chambers, radiating waves of deadly sapping necrotic magic.

Like her siblings, the purpose of Dalyria's existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant. It was unknown if the ritual was successful and Dalyria was destroyed, or if the ritual never was completed, leaving Dalyria freed from her dark master, or if she was slain in the process.
