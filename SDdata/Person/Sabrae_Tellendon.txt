'''Sabrae Tellendon''' was a [[drow]] High Priestess of [[Eilistraee]] who oversaw the descent to [[Undermountain]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
[[Kiyanda]] was Sabrae Tellendon's acolyte and while the High Priestess monitored drow activities in the North, Kiyanda traveled into Undermountain and Underdark too gather intel on the followers of [[Lolth]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR]], Sabrae Tellendon could be found in the [[Yawning Portal]] healing adventurers brave enough to delve into the dangerous mega dungeon of Undermountain. She offered her [[cleric]]al aid to the lone hero tasked with investigation into [[kobold]] activities by [[Khelben Arunsun]] one behalf of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].

During that time, she served as an informer for the lone hero, keeping them up to date on the drow activities within the Undermountain, and their recent return to the deep cavern within the mega dungeon where the ancient [[Garden of the Drow]] could be found.
