'''Oberon''' was a [[Netherese arcanist]] during the [[Age of Discovery]] of [[Netheril]].

==Personality==
Oberon was a strong supporter of expeditions into [[Realmspace]]. He kept undertaking such expeditions even after other [[archwizard]]s stopped funding them in {{Yearlink|-964}}, in the hopes of finding resources to gain an advantage in the competition for power. Such resources were never found, but even after his death ten years later, his followers continued propagating his views.

==History==
Oberon was a specialist in "quasidimensional transport" and was credited with many of the spells associated with teleportation and planar travel, such as ''[[banishment]]'', ''[[blink]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', and ''[[teleport]]'', among others.

In his travels into Realmspace, Oberon also sought to reestablish relations with other races, in an attempt to make amends for the damage caused by the aggressive actions of early explorers from [[Yeoman's Loft]] in previous years. He became respected by Realmspace inhabitants, but, despite his efforts, they continued to view the nation of Netheril as corrupt and evil.
