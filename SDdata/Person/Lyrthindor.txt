'''Lyrthindor''' was the last of the [[Dark Justiciars]] of [[Shar]] that survived the near-extermination of his order. He utilized infernal magic to remain hidden away within the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Some remember turning away from the sun. Some remember donning a black cloak. Some remember plunging a blade into an innocent heart.|Lyrthindor.}}

==Description==
As an elven man, Lyrthindor wore the suit of armor and distinct helm of Shar's justiciars. To save his own life, Lyrthindor managed to transform himself into a swarm of [[rat]]s, each of which contained a piece of his psyche.

==Personality==
After his transformation, Lyrthindor's mind remained fractured. Each rat he had become held different memories from his life as a Dark Justiciar.

==Abilities==
Lyrthindor was capable of casting several [[necromantic]] spells including ''[[beckoning darkness]]'' and ''[[Blight (spell)|blight]]''.

He also possessed what was known as ''Shar's sight'', which prevented him from being blinded.

==Possessions==
He wielded a ''[[justiciar's scimitar]]'' and ''[[justiciar's greatshield|greatshield]]'' in battle.

==Activities==
After his transformation, Lyrthindor spent all of his time merely surviving. He lived in perpetual fear of being hunted down like Shar's other justiciars.

==History==
At some point, the [[orthon]] named [[Yurgir]] signed a contract with [[Raphael]], the [[cambion|half-infernal]] son of [[Archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]], in agreement to kill all of the Dark Justiciars within the Gauntlet of Shar.

Lyrthindor managed to survive by some transforming himself into a swarm of rats. It appeared that he learned this secret from the book ''[[One Becomes Many]]'', written by Raphael himself.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lyrthindor still lingered in Shar's Gauntlet for some time. His continued existence prevented Yurgir from completing his infernal contract with Raphael.
