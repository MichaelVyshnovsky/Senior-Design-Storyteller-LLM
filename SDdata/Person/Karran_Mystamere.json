        "mainbody": "Dame '''Karran Mystamere''' was the Assistant to the [[Lord Mayor]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Karran was an attractive and fit [[human]] woman with fair skin and green eyes. She had long, straight blonde hair. Dame Mystamere had a keen mind and talent in handling her city official position through confidence, presence, and a comforting demeanor.",
        "Possessions": "Dame Karran never parted with her ''[[amulet of proof vs detection & location]]''. As a city official, she used a special type of [[ink]] of crimson color.",
        "History": "In her younger days, Karran Mystamere was an accomplished [[adventur]]er and one of the original members of the [[Knight of the Lady]]. She forged her reputation by being loyal to the city of Ravens Bluff, and eventually, she was granted the position of Assistant to the Lord Mayor of the Living City. By the time Dame reached middle age, she had become one of the most trusted servants of the city and was held in high regard, tasked with handling some of the more sensitive tasks by the Lord Mayor. In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Dame Mystamere served Lady Lord Mayor [[Amber Lynn Thoden]].\n\nOne of the sensitive assignments entrusted to Dame Mystamere was the handling of the [[Flight of Arrows]], a [[Zhentarim]] splinter group that broke ties and betrayed the sinister organization. Its members pleaded with Ravens Bluff for an asylum. Karran handled assignments of some of the most deserts heroes of the Living City in dealing with assassination attempts by the Zhentarim on the Flight of Arrows. When members of the Flight were ensorcelled with a specific combination of the ''[[geas]]'' and ''[[curse]]'' [[spell]]s, Dame Mystamere, in secrecy, tasked another group of adventurers with tracking down a famed powerful [[priest]], secretly an [[archlich]], [[Athoomb]], capable of removing the magics from the Flight of Arrows, now under the protection of Ravens Bluff."
