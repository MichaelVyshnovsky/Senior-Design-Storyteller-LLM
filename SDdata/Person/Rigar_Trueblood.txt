'''Rigar Trueblood''' was a veteran warrior and hero.

As he lay on his deathbed, Rigar Trueblood begged his companion, the mage [[Spectorial]], to preserve his skill and fortitude in battle. Although reluctant, Spectorial acceded and extracted these qualities from Rigar's soul, placing them into the ''[[pale green ioun stone]]'' so that others might benefit from them. However, Rigar's own soul would then lack these skills.
