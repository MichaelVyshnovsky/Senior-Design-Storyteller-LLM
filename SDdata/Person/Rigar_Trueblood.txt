Rigar Trueblood was a veteran warrior and hero.
As he lay on his deathbed, Rigar Trueblood begged his companion, the mage Spectorial, to preserve his skill and fortitude in battle. Although reluctant, Spectorial acceded and extracted these qualities from Rigars soul, placing them into the pale green ioun stone so that others might benefit from them. However, Rigars own soul would then lack these skills.
