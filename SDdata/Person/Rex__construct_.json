        "mainbody": "ex was a shield guardian and companion of the rock gnome Zox Clammersham that lived within Undermountain during the 15 century DR.\nUnlike other shield guardians, Rex was not keyed to a magical amulet. As such, he could never be commanded by another individual. Thanks to Zox, Rex had a greater invisibility spell stored within itself.\nSomewhat unique in appearance, Rex had gold stars and crescent moons painted on its surface."
