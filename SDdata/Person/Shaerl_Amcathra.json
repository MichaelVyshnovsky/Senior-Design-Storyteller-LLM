        "History": "Shaerl was sent to Shadowdale by [[Vangerdahast]] in [[1355 DR]], to investigate why the last two lords of Shadowdale had been \"chosen\" by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]]. She fell in love with the then ruler of Shadowdale, Mourngrym Amcathra, and the pair married the same year.\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], very pregnant Shaerl was attacked by an assassin sent to kill [[Lhaeo]]. The hulking humanoid dressed in black southern garb ambushed the soon-to-be mother and attempted to take her hostage. He did not expect Shaerl to be able to defend herself.{{Cite comic/Dragonsmoker}} The Lady of Shadowdale elbowed the assassin in the stomach and knocked him out with a punch. The stress of the fight caused her to go into labor shortly after. Luckily [[Elminster]] and his guest [[Foxilon Cardluck]] were there to aid with the baby's delivery. The child was named [[Scothgar Amcathra]] or Scotti for short.{{Cite comic/Dragons (and Other Beasts)}}"
