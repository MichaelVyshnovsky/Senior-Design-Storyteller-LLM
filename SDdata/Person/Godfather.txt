The '''Godfather''' was the leader of a [[duergar]] clan in [[Gracklstugh]]. It was unknown if he was a real person or fictional character, but part of his story was immortalized in story "The Daring Duergar" in the book ''[[Fables of Faer√ªn]]''.

{{Quote|The lesson is complete.}}

==History==
One day, a young duergar by the name of [[Shull]] reached out to the Godfather, eager to develop his [[psionic]] abilities. The Godfather directed the power-hungry youth to seek out the [[mind flayer]] known as [[Ir]], far from their home city.

Some time later, Shull returned to the Godfather, armed with the ability to destroy a single mind with a mere [[command word]]. Eager to kill the Godfather and seize his power for himself, Shull demonstrated his newfound ability, and immediately exploded his own skull. The Godfather had completed his lesson to the young, disloyal duergar.
