Shenandra attempted to counteract the phaerimms attempt to deprive the land of nourishment and magic. She met several failures when trying to develop this counter spell, but she finally developed one in . \nShenandra cast the spell to negate the magic of the phaerimm, but the evil Crown of Horns corrupted her colleagues work at the same time. As this happened, the legendary crown absorbed all magical items and spell effects on the enclave, and it came crashing to the ground."
