        "mainbody": "'''Worlges the Black''' was a rich hunter from [[Dargendale]] of the [[Dalelands]], who made a name for himself by killing the [[White Stag of Dargendale]] sometimes before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Worlges lived surrounded by servants and considered himself to be one of the best hunters alive. His ego received a boost after he managed to capture the elusive White Stag of Dargendale, who remained a local omen of good luck for several decades. Worlges killed and stuffed the beautiful creature, placing it in his private bedchambers. The death of the local benevolent legend angered the peasantry. Eventually, it inspired a traveling [[druid]] to sneak into the hunter's home to animate the taxidermy stag with its spirit temporarily. Worlges the Black was killed the same night as the White Stag exacted its revenge by skewering the hunter to the bed. In the morning, Worlges' servants found their master's body in bed, riddled with antler holes and covered in down feathers. The White Stag of Dargendale was standing in its spot, unmoving, with the hunter's blood on its antlers."
