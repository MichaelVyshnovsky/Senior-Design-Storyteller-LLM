Aiden was an fallen aasimar
While Aiden had black hair in his youth, it gradually went white over time.
Due to his unique manner of celestial ancestry, Aiden could surround himself with an aura of necrotic energy for a minute at a time. This was a terrifying effect that often cause those nearby to flee in horror.
Aidens preferred weapons of choice were a pair of short blades, one vicious dagger and one dagger of warning.

Aiden was childhood friends with the warrior Xander and the wizard-turned-warlock Helene. Xander was especially close to Aiden and considered him as a brother.
When Aiden and Xander were traveling through the forests of Norland in their youth, they were attacked by a pack of wolves. The pair were saved by their friend Helene, who was on her way to join the White Sails company of Mintarn. They accompanied her on her journey, 
After arriving by sea at Mintarn, the group became fast friends, and eventually all joined the White Sails company together, serving aboard the Hesperornis with Captain Nycto. Throughout their years together, Aiden and his friends sailed all over the world, visiting grand cities such as Neverwinter

Some time during or before the ,These events take place during or before the truth about the Companion over Elturel is revealed. after many years of travel, the group returned home together to Mintarn. Just as they arrived, the isle came under attack by the terrible red dragon Hoondarrh. Despite the mass destruction, the Aiden and his friends survived, helping whomever they could.
Over time, Aiden came to captain a vessel of his own, taking on several of his friends as crew members. After enjoying a brief reunion with the absent Helene, Aiden and the others responded to a plea for help from a delegate of House Kendrck, and journeyed to the village of Dynnegall on the isle of Moray to stop destruction caused by the Black Blood tribe. Tragically, an infernal pact Helene inadvertently made with the archdevil Zariel caused her to corrupt the power of the moonwell at Dernall Forest and allowed the deceased dragon Skadaurak to possess Rayondes body.
This tragic event caused the group of allies to part ways for good. Aiden joined up Janolus and his goblin crew, acquiring a submarine of his own known as the Blue Glaucus. Unfortunately none of the group could contact or otherwise reach Aiden, and they believed he was dead. 
After some time, Helene, Xander, Karrin, Kerrin, and Helene rallied the armies of the Moonshaes against the returned Skadaurak on Alaron. When they encountered the monster in Rayondes body, they fought him and his fomorian guards together, but soon discovered they were greatly outnumbered. Just as all seemed lost for the group, Aiden arrived with the Blue Glaucus and took his friends to safety.

All together one again, the group set out for Skadaurak Island all together for the first time in years. They fought their way through Skadauraks forces and Aiden tracked the possessed Rayonde to a lone cave where his goblin crewmembers had been slain. Aiden and Rayonde fought a brief battle, but the red dragon got the upper hand and incinerated Aiden with his fire breath.
Following Helenes final confrontation with Skadaurak and her infernal patron, she wished that she had never met her friends, nor let them come to harm. While the exact results of that wish were unknown, a living Aiden later walked along a beach and found Helenes amulet struck with the memory of them and their friends sailing for Mintarn so long before.
