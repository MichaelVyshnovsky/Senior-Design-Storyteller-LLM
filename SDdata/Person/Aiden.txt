{{Quote|I've been all over this world, and they're the best people I've ever met. The greatest heroes. I don't deserve their friendship â€” I never have. Hey, you better not repeat this birdbrain...|Aiden, talking to his [[kenku]] friend [[Solivigant]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|11}}}}

Aiden's preferred weapons of choice were a pair of short blades,{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|15}} one [[vicious]] [[dagger]] and one ''[[dagger of warning]]''.

==Relationships==
[[File:Companions.png|thumb|right|350px|Aiden and his friends during their first trip to [[Mintarn]].]]
Aiden was childhood friends with the warrior [[Xander]] and the [[wizard]]-turned-[[warlock]] [[Helene]]. Xander was especially close to Aiden and considered him as a brother.

==History==
When Aiden and Xander were traveling through the forests of Norland in their youth, they were attacked by a pack of [[wolves]]. The pair were saved by their friend Helene, who was on her way to join the [[White Sails]] company of [[Mintarn]]. They accompanied her on her journey,{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|11-12}} 

After arriving by sea at Mintarn, the group became fast friends,{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|13-15}}{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|19}} and eventually all joined the White Sails company together, serving aboard the [[Hesperornis]]{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|6}} with Captain [[Nycto]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|1-4}} Throughout their years together, Aiden and his friends sailed all over the world, visiting grand cities such as [[Neverwinter]]{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|?}} 

[[File:Aiden, Helene.png|thumb|left|300px|A young Aiden and [[Helene]] working for the [[White Sails]] company.]]
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}},<ref group="note">These events take place during or before the truth about [[the Companion]] over [[Elturel]] is revealed. after many years of travel, the group returned home together to Mintarn.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|6}} Just as they arrived, the isle came under attack by the terrible [[red dragon]] [[Hoondarrh]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|11-14}} Despite the mass destruction, the Aiden and his friends survived, helping whomever they could.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|3-7}}

Over time, Aiden came to captain a vessel of his own, taking on several of his friends as crew members. After enjoying a brief reunion with the absent Helene,{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|12}} Aiden and the others responded to a plea for help from a delegate of [[Kendrick|House Kendrck]], and journeyed to the village of [[Dynnegall]] on the isle of [[Moray]] to stop destruction caused by the [[Black Blood tribe]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|13-15}} Tragically, an [[infernal pact]] Helene inadvertently made with the [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]] caused her to corrupt the power of the [[moonwell]] at [[Dernall Forest]] and allowed the deceased dragon [[Skadaurak]] to possess [[Rayonde]]'s body.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3|17-19}}

This tragic event caused the group of allies to part ways for good.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|6}} Aiden joined up [[Janolus Fuscus|Janolus]] and his [[goblin]] crew, acquiring a [[submarine]] of his own known as the ''[[Blue Glaucus]]''.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|14-15}} Unfortunately none of the group could contact or otherwise reach Aiden, and they believed he was dead.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|10}} 

After some time, Helene, Xander, Karrin, Kerrin, and Helene rallied the armies of the Moonshaes against the returned Skadaurak on [[Alaron]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|1-4}} When they encountered the monster in Rayonde's body,{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1|20}} they fought him and his [[fomorian]] guards together, but soon discovered they were greatly outnumbered.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2|15-20}} Just as all seemed lost for the group, Aiden arrived with the ''Blue Glaucus'' and took his friends to safety.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|12-13}}

[[File:Aiden, Rayonde.png|thumb|right|300px|Aiden's final confrontation with [[Rayonde]], possessed by the spirit of the [[red dragon]] [[Skadaurak]].]]
All together one again, the group set out for [[Skadaurak Island]] all together for the first time in years.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|18-20}} They fought their way through Skadaurak's forces{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|1-4}} and Aiden tracked the possessed Rayonde to a lone cave where his goblin crewmembers had been slain. Aiden and Rayonde fought a brief battle, but the red dragon got the upper hand and incinerated Aiden with his fire breath.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|5-8}}

Following Helene's final confrontation with Skadaurak and her [[Asmodeus|infernal patron]], she wished that she had never met her friends, nor let them come to harm.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 5|12-19}} While the exact results of that wish were unknown, a living Aiden later walked along a beach and found Helene's amulet struck with the memory of them and their friends sailing for Mintarn so long before.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|20}}
