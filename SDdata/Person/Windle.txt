==Possessions==

==History==
Some years after the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], that befell the city in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Windle was stationed at the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath]] graveyard in the city. Working with [[Tristopher Chettlebell]], she uncovered a plot by the [[Red Wizards]] involving the [[Clockwork Tomb|tomb]] of the [[Clockwork Guild]].<ref name="D&D.N />

Some time later, she joined the efforts to defeat [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] at the [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] that was constructed in [[Neverwinter Wood]].<ref name="N.S />

When the [[Cult of the Dragon]] emerged as a threat to the Realms in the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} Harper Windle played an important role in Neverwinter's defense. She rallied together a group of [[adventurer]]s to rebuff the assault of the [[green dragon]] [[Charthraxis]]. While investigating the cult's activities, she worked her fellow agent [[Boward]] and discovered an alliance between them and the renegade faction of Red Wizards.<ref name="N.ToD>

In the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, she was the Harper delegated to help a hired adventuring party to defeat the great dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]] of [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. The Harpers' main objectives were to investigate some [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] who had gained admittance into the new faction of the Cult of the Dragon, as well as to gain the alliance of [[fey]] lords of the forest.{{Cite adventurers league/Corruption in Kryptgarden|8}}
