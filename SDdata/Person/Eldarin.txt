He wore a set of enchanted +1 plate mail and used a composite longbow in combat along with magic +1 arrows. An expensive but non-magical bloodstone amulet hung around Eldarins neck.
In the , Eldarin and Suna Seni worked with a cabal of slavers who operated out of slums in Athkatla. When Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian interrupted the slaving operations, Eldarin and Suna Seni began hunting the adventurer  and his companions across the City of Coin.
