Lady-Consort Saesaan Aelorothi was a feyri wizard-thief of House Aelorothi of Siluvanede and a member of the daemonfey in 1369 DR.
She was constantly cloaked in writhing, shifting shadows.
As a feyri, Saesaan had the unique powers to cast dimension door, ESP, and darkness, 15 radius once a day each, and was resistant to poison.
Saesaan was the consort of Lord Pharnth Aelorothi. She won his respect and her place by his side by bypassing his magical wards and stealing his most valued spellbook.
Saesaans duty was to acquire arcane lore and powerful magic items for the daemonfey. She reported directly to Sarya Dlardrageth.
Saesaan had an excessive passion for intrigues and betrayals, even for a feyri, and for this was hated by most of her fellows.
