'''Andreas Vanderslyke''' was a monster hunter.

==Personality==
The hunter traveled far and wide in search of [[evil]] creatures to stalk. His home was the wilderness, and he was uncomfortable in towns and cities. He explored dungeons not to find treasure, but to test himself against dangerous monsters that lived there.

==History==
Around [[1369 DR]], Andreas and his companion [[Honus]] were ambushed and pursued by the [[Shadowcloaks]] of [[Calaunt]]. Trapped in a small room, Vanderslyke and Honus were surrounded by the criminal organization and given a mock trial with [[Shartana]] acting as judge and jury.
