Asana Haraad was the daughter of the mayor of Amkethran, Omar Haraad. She wished to help its people after the invasion by Balthazar.
She would often save the lives of the starving citizens. In the late 1360s DR, she stole money from Balthazars mercenaries, and they threatened to publicly execute her. She begged to be spared, but ultimately regretted nothing. Asana may have been saved by Gorions Ward, with Montolios cloak being his reward.
