        "mainbody": "Skar was a goblin bandit of the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR. He served Hekkut and the Hark.\nSkar was psychotic and spiteful, as well as stubborn, but brave.\nLike many goblins, he fought with morning stars, had a light crossbow, and wore studded leather armor, and may have had a potion of cure light wounds.\nLate one afternoon in Eleasias of the , Skar, Gvrag, and two other goblins caught the halfling merchant Blaz Merrymar on the road between Loudwater and Shining Falls. While Gvrag held Blaz in the air, Skar tormented and tortured him with a lit torch. Blaz heard him remark \"This half-man has looser skin than the others. We must be getting to the bottom of the barrel.\" Fortunately for Blaz, a newly formed band of adventurers happened upon the scene and rescued him, slaying Skar and the others."
