        "mainbody": "Saphirax was an ancient dragon that dwelled within the Whispering Caverns sometime during or before the late 15 century DR. She was known to possess a hoard that included artifacts from civilizations that existed millennium before the Era of Upheaval.\nIn the 1480s DR, agents of the Cult of the Dragon led by Dragonsoul Thanin deployed slaves to dig through old tunnels dug by duergar dwarves to gain access to Saphiraxs lair, in search for the artifacts within. Their excavation proved unsuccessful however. The cults plot was eventually thwarted by Dran Barrow and Shay Cutter, two agents of the Zhentarim, and an adventurer working with them."
