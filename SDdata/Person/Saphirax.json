        "mainbody": "'''Saphirax''' was an ancient [[dragon]] that dwelled within the [[Whispering Caverns]] sometime during or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was known to possess a hoard that included [[artifact]]s from civilizations that existed millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]].",
        "History": "In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] led by [[Dragonsoul]] [[Thanin]] deployed slaves to dig through old tunnels dug by [[duergar]] dwarves to gain access to Saphirax's lair, in search for the artifacts within. Their excavation proved unsuccessful however. The cult's plot was eventually thwarted by [[Dran Barrow]] and [[Shay Cutter]], two agents of the [[Zhentarim]], and [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|an adventurer]] working with them."
