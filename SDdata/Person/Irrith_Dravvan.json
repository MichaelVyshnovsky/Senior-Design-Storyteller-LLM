        "mainbody": "Irrith \"Two Coins\" Dravvan was an heir inhabiting the city of Suldolphor in the far eastern reaches of Calimshan in south Faer√ªn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe was a handsome and sarcastic man.\nIrrith received his nickname as he was duped out of his family inheritance, leaving him with just two coins to his name. Slowly but surely, Irrith rebuilt his fortune over several decades, eventually becoming wealthier than he was at birth. During his ordeal to rebuild his wealth, he developed many useful points of contact and a skill for recovering things quickly."
