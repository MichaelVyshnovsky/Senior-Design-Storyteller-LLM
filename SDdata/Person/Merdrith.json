        "mainbody": "erdrith the Mad was a former zulkir of the Red Wizards until his self-imposed exile to the High Forest.\nMerdrith had head tattoos marking him as a Red Wizard and his beard was dyed red. He appeared as a hermit in plain and bedraggled clothes.\nAbout 1360 DR, a group of Red Wizards with Merdrith in tow attacked the Watchtower in Rashemen and gained the Windwalker amulet and a magical ebony staff. Merdrith killed all of his companions in order to seize the treasure for himself, effectively ensuring he could never again return to Thay. He used the ebony staff to control a magical hut with chicken legs. While he was out, a Rashemi named Fyodor raided the hut to retrieve the Windwalker, which he needed to fulfill a quest. \nMerdrith retired to a new home in the High Forest (where he lived close to Eilistraeans, which he hated). He was recruited by the drow Gorlist and Brindlor Zidorion to aid in their pursuit of Liriel Baenre (who, unbeknownst to Merdrith, was traveling with Fyodor, who had been the one to raid his house) and the Windwalker. However, the groups plan went awry, and Merdrith was killed by the shapeshifted Fyodor in bear shape.\nThe magical chicken-legged hut that Merdith was able to control with the ebony staff was of Rashemi origin. Fyodor remembered a verse from his childhood that allowed him to enter the hut.\n\"While the mistress is asleep,\nChicken-legs a watch will keep.\nWhen the mistress wanders off,\nChicken-legs will stand aloft.\nWhen the mistress comes again,\nChicken-legs will let her in.\nStara Baba casts this spell,\nListen, hut, and hearken well.\" \n*Daughter of the Drow (mentioned)\n*Windwalker\nCategoryMembers of the Red Wizards of Thay\nCategoryInhabitants of Thay\nCategoryInhabitants of East Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of the High Forest\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryHumans\n1mdwnj2x6kzpamtis0bqrunlit058zo"
