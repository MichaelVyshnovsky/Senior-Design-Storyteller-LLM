        "History": "He was born in the {{YearlinkName|815}} and became ruler of something called the Urgh. Known for his cruelty, he almost conquered the [[North]] and nearly became the champion of the [[West Marches]].\n\nHowever, he ultimately died of shock when he won the state lottery in the {{YearlinkName|874}}.\n\nFor unknown reasons, there was a statue in memory of him on the second level of [[Undermountain]] as of [[1372 DR]], which related the above information about him."
