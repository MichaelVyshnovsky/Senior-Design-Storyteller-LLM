'''Shi Lo''' was a [[samurai]] participant at the [[Komite]] in [[Shou Lung]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Born as the daughter of a noble of the [[Imperial Court]], she studied calligraphy and poetry. She first trained in martial arts under Master [[Lin Kwan Shu]] of the [[Five Stars]] school. She showed such a great ability to focus her [[ki]] that she earned the interest of Master [[Liu]] of the [[Southern Star]]. Master Liu decided to recruited her and Shi Lo accepted. Shi Lo proved herself very suitable to the Southern Star style and soon she gained great renown, with many martial artists going to watch her training. Rumors said that Shi Lo performed for the Emperor on several occasions.

In 1358 DR, Shi Lo went to participate at the Komite. She managed to finish among the tournament's finalists.
