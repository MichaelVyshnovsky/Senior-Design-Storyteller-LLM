Muranee Crownlinden was the proprietor of Muranees Old Treasures, a used clothing store in Hultail in the late 15 century DR.
By the late 15 century DR, Muranees shop – a converted house – traded in used goods, including boots and other footwear, and could be found on Hultails main street that stretched from east to west. Muranee was aided by six orphan girls who were taken in to maintain the home and run the business, Jeveldra Shieldwinter being the most competent among them. The women all lived inside the shop, hoisting their beds down from the attic every evening after the store closed.
