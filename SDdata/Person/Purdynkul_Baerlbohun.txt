Purdynkul Baerlbohun was the eldest son of Unsible Baerlbohun, the "Mad Toymaker," who rose to wealth and prominence in Athkatla in the 14 century DR.
Purdynkul lived in the citys affluent Gem District in a famously gaudy monstrosity of a mansion known as the Baerlbohun House along with his father and siblings. Purdynkul was a large and waddling man known for his laziness, the trait he shared with his brothers.
By the late 14 century DR Purdynkuls eager socialite sister Arisrathra Baerlbohun was the most well-known member of the Baerlbohun family after Unsible, the patriarch.
