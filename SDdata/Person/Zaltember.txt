Zaltember was a fire giant and the sadistic son of Duke Zalto in Ironslag sometime after the War of the Silver Marches.
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Zaltember was overseeing four ogres in the upper level of Ironslags foundry. He entertained himself torturing a shield dwarf slave.
Zaltember was at heart a bully and a coward. If injured, he quickly escaped to his mother. He also tried to impress enemies by declaring himself to be the son of Zalto.
