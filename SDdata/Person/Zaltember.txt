'''Zaltember''' was a [[fire giant]] and the sadistic son of Duke [[Zalto]] in [[Ironslag]] sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, Zaltember was overseeing four [[ogre]]s in the upper level of Ironslag's foundry. He entertained himself torturing a [[shield dwarf]] slave.

==Personality==
Zaltember was at heart a bully and a coward. If injured, he quickly escaped to his mother. He also tried to impress enemies by declaring himself to be the son of Zalto.
