        "mainbody": "Safiya was a Red Wizard of Thay in the mid-to-late 14 century DR and one of the companions of the Kalach-Cha.\nUnlike many Red Wizards, Safiya was uninterested in struggling for power, and preferred scholarly research and practice of arcane magic. Safiya was interested in magic that transformed and creating constructs. She worked as an instructor at the Academy of Shapers and Binders, of which her mother Nefris was the headmistress.\nShe appeared shy on the rare occasions when she smiled, apparently for lack of practice. Yet she had mental resilience from her upbringing in Thay. The Kalach-Cha inferred that her somewhat sheltered upbringing as the headmistresss daughter might have had something to do with her being \"less ruthless\" than other Red Wizards.\nSafiya had golden-hued skin, delicate features, and almond-shaped dark eyes, and appeared beautiful to most eyes. She shaved her head bald, for it was adorned with the fine tattoos of a Red Wizard.\nSafiya had a homunculus familiar named Kaji. It was one of her first creations and she was quite fond of it.\nAs a wizard, Safiya was specialized in the school of transmutation (and restricted from both conjuration and illusion). As a transmuter, she was dedicated to building and shaping objects, and was skilled at crafting enchanted weaponry and armaments."
