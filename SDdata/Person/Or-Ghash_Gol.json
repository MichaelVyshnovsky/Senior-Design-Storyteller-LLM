        "History": "By {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Gol was interred near [[Mount Or-Ghash]].<ref group=\"note\">It's not known if the mountain is named for Gol or if Gol is named for the mountain. As a memorial to the high lama, one hundred caskets were placed along the pass to the mountain, approximately {{SI|100|yard|long=yes}} apart. Only one casket held Gol's remains, but which it was was a secret known only to the high lamas dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash. The mountain was visited often by lamas and [[pilgrim]]s. It was expected that pilgrims make an offering such as a [[scarf]] on top of every casket. Strangely, each spring, the high lamas placed a new set of clothes in the true casket of Or-Ghash Gol, and each autumn they took them out again, finding them used, dirtied, and torn."
