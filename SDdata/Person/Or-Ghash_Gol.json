        "mainbody": "High Lama Or-Ghash Gol was a lama dwelling in the Chigidi Mountains on the Plain of Horses. Highly revered, Gol was considered to be the greatest high lama to have ever lived in the area.\nBy , Gol was interred near Mount Or-Ghash.Its not known if the mountain is named for Gol or if Gol is named for the mountain. As a memorial to the high lama, one hundred caskets were placed along the pass to the mountain, approximately  apart. Only one casket held Gols remains, but which it was was a secret known only to the high lamas dwelling on Mount Or-Ghash. The mountain was visited often by lamas and pilgrims. It was expected that pilgrims make an offering such as a scarf on top of every casket. Strangely, each spring, the high lamas placed a new set of clothes in the true casket of Or-Ghash Gol, and each autumn they took them out again, finding them used, dirtied, and torn."
