        "mainbody": "sobel Thorm was a half-elf cleric of Selûne and daughter of general Ketheric Thorm. Isobel was killed some time in the 14 century DR, leading to her fathers conversion to the church of Shar and later Myrkul. She was resurrected in the late 15 century DR as part of Ketherics pact with Myrkul and subsequently assisted the resistance against the Absolute.\nAs an experienced cleric of Selûne, Isobel was capable of channeling divine energy from moonlight to create a type of protection magic called Moonshield, which helped her create a safe space within the deadly Shadow-cursed lands. She could also bless individual beings and grant them protection over the weaker shadow curse from harming them.\nWhen she was alive and well, Isobel loved and admired her father, Ketheric Thorm. She was grateful for all the guidance and care her father gave to her. After being resurrected by Ketheric, her love and admiration toward her father were gone. She was disgusted and frightened by how wicked and twisted her father had become.\nIsobel had a romantic relationship with Dame Aylin, the divine daughter of goddess Selûne herself. She fell in love with Aylin at the first sight when Aylin visited her hometown the feeling was mutual. However, Ketheric was not fond of their relationship.\nIsobel grew up in a Selûnite family with father Ketheric and mother Melodia in Reithwin. Unfortunately, her mother died very young. Isobel was raised and taught to be a Selûne cleric by Ketheric alone. For unknown reasons, Isobel died at a young age, making Ketheric mentally collapse and converted his faith from Selûne to her dark sister, Shar, and (eventually) to the death god Myrkul. After being dead and buried, Isobel found herself waking up in a dusty coffin with her changed father. She was also informed by Ketheric that Aylin was dead. Frightened and terrified by how her father had changed, she ran away from the Thorm Mausoleum and created herself a safe space in the Last Light inn within the Shadow-cursed lands.\nEventually her safe space got the attention of Jaheira and her Harpers who came to investigate the Cult of the Absolute. From the information she was given, she realized that she has been dead over a century and her father was the source of the Shadow curse. She also noticed some tainted energy within herself after the resurrection and only could recall the darkness of her death. Knowing what was at the stake, Isobel allied with Jaheira and her subordinates and helped them dealing with the Cult of the Absolute."
