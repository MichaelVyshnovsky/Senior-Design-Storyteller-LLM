        "mainbody": "hezz Tlabbar was a drow warrior of House Faen Tlabbar in Menzoberranzan.\nThezz had a good appearance.\nThezz always tried to bully people of Houses lowest than his, but reluctantly obeyed those of higher-ranked Houses.\nIn 1479 DR, Thezz was among the people gathered to inspect the lost outpost of Sezzia, alongside priestesses Guannerrae Tlabbar, Myaral Tlabbar, and Iyelle Tlabbar, among others. However, Iyelle turned traitor and attacked her fellows, including Thezz, during a battle with some monsters.\nThezz survived without injuries, unlike the priestesses, so he became the spokesman of the group. He planned to go back to Menzoberranzan.\nThezz was a favorite of First Priestess Luafae Tlabbar."
