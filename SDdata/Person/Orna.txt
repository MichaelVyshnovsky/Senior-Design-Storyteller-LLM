Orna was a former member of the Cult of the Black Earth at the Temple of the Black Earth in Tyar-Besil in the 1490s DR.
Orna was a greedy and brutal individual. She wanted revenge against the cult.
In 1491 DR, Orna was in Tyar-Besil. She dared to strike a Black Earth priest, so her fellow cultists captured and jailed her. Some time later, some adventurers defeated the jailer cultists and Orna tried to convince them to free her.
