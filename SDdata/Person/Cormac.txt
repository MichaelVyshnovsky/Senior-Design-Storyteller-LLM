==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] was under a looming threat of the army of [[the Absolute]] and was flooded by refugees from the [[Western Heartlands]] fleeing from the cultists. During the time of crisis, crime was on the rise, and the criminal organization known as [[The Guild]] was getting bold and aggressive. Brigid's husband Cormac was attacked by the Guild's thugs, mugged, and beaten. Brigid was outraged by the crime wave and was prepared to give a stern talking to the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenaries of [[Rivington]] where the attack took place.
