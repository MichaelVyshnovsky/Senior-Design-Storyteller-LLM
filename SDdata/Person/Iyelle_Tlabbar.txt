Iyelle Tlabbar was a drow priestess of House Faen Tlabbar in Menzoberranzan.
Iyelle, like many other priestesses, strongly believed that the Demon Weave was a bad idea, fearing that males would challenge their power.
In 1479 DR, Iyelle was among the people gathered to inspect the lost outpost of Sezzia, alongside priestesses Guannerrae Tlabbar and Myaral Tlabbar and the warrior Thezz Tlabbar, among others. However, Iyelle turned traitor and attacked her fellows during a battle with some monsters.
Later, Iyelle retreated inside the outpost with three hobgoblin slaves, where she was confronted by adventurers hired by House Xorlarrin, House Melarn, and Bregan Daerthe.
