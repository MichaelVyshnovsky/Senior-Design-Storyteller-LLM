'''Iyelle Tlabbar''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[House Faen Tlabbar]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].
  
==Personality==
Iyelle, like many other priestesses, strongly believed that the [[Demon Weave]] was a bad idea, fearing that males would challenge their power.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], Iyelle was among the people gathered to inspect the lost outpost of [[Sezz'ia]], alongside priestesses [[Guannerrae Tlabbar]] and [[Myaral Tlabbar]] and the warrior [[Thezz Tlabbar]], among others. However, Iyelle turned traitor and attacked her fellows during a battle with some monsters.

Later, Iyelle retreated inside the outpost with three [[hobgoblin]] slaves, where she was confronted by adventurers hired by [[House Xorlarrin]], [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]], and [[Bregan D'aerthe]].
