'''Mjenir Tormhaalt''' ({{Pronounce|meh|YEN|eer|refs=}}<ref group="note">The pronunciation of his surname isn't mentioned in the ''[[Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden]]''.) was a [[Reghedmen]] [[human]] [[shaman]] from the [[Tribe of the Elk]] on the [[Reghed Glacier]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He relished the authority he had earned through his ostensible revelations from the spirits, but most of the time, his counsel simply derived from his deep knowledge of nature. He waged a constant struggle to protect his position from upheaval.

==Description==
Even though Mjenir's age was close to that of King [[Jarund Elkhardt|Jarund]], Mjenir looked a decade younger because he had neither borne the weight of the tribe's leadership nor faced the rigors of warfare.

Mjenir had icy blue eyes and long braided platinum-blond hair.

==Abilities==
Mjenir had a profound understanding of the natural world and it alone made him an invaluable member of the tribe. Mjenir was known for his ability to [[speak with animals]]. However, he had nearly no control over the spirits of nature and could perform only the simplest [[divination]]s.

The shaman was able to cast the ''[[produce flame]]'' cantrip.

==Relationships==
Mjenir had a short marriage with a woman who passed away when their only son, [[Olaf Tormhaalt]], was still a child.

Mjenir's relationship with Olaf remained distant, primarily because the shaman's main priority was safeguarding his standing within the clan.

He was suspicious about [[Hedrun Arnsfirth|Hedrun]]'s emerging powers exceeding his own, which could result in him losing his position in the tribe. Mjenir encouraged the tribe to treat the girl as a threat.

One of the tribe's older warriors, [[Soren Arnsfirth]], Hedrun's father, sought advice and help for his daughter from Mjenir, but the shaman wasn't interested in it and insisted on ostracizing the girl.

All members of the Tribe of the Elk sought his guidance. King Jarund constantly consulted with Mjenir, especially when Auril inflicted severe winters on the surrounding lands. As both of their sons passed away, the king's bond with his shaman deepened.

==History==
During his early years, Mjenir commenced his apprenticeship with the tribe's former shaman. Later he became the shaman of the Tribe of the Elk and wielded the most authority among the tribe's members, second only to the king.

The shaman also forbade his son Olaf to see Hedrun when he realized that the boy had fallen in love with her. But the two continued to meet and it ended with Olaf's death as a result of Hedrun's uncontrollable gifts. Later Mjenir brought Olaf's dead body before King Jarund to ensure Hedrun was banished from the tribe. The shaman didn't demand her death as he was afraid of the possible power of the girl's vengeful spirit and hoped Hedrun would meet her end facing the dangers of the Reghed Glacier's wildlife.

With the unexpected early arrival of winter storms in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, and rumors of an [[Hedrun Arnsfirth|Ice Witch]] sweeping through the area, he began to question to himself whether banishing Hedrun had been a misstep. He assumed her to be the reason for the calamity. Worried that he or his tribe could be blamed for provoking the witch's fury, he resisted [[Hengar Aesnvaard]]'s proposal to seek assistance from [[Ten-Towns]]. He pushed for the tribe to keep moving, yet he harbored the knowledge that he couldn't escape the unforgiving grip of winter's wrath. He sought a means to confront the witch's threat without confessing his role to the rest of the tribe.
