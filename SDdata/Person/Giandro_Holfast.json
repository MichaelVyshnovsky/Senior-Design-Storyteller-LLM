        "mainbody": "'''Giandro Holfast''' was a master shipwright of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the 1480s DR, he was the Speaker of Targos and its representative to the council of the [[Ten Towns]] and also one of the leaders of the [[Dockworker's Guild]].",
        "Description": "At middle age, Giandro had dark hair and well-callused hands from a life of work. He had a strong jaw and could be considered handsome but for his constantly frowning. His voice was stern and gravelly.",
        "Personality": "With pride in his work and in his town, Giandro was resolute that Targos should be self-reliant.",
        "Activities": "As well as being a master shipwright working at the docks, as Speaker, Giandro led the town and represented it on the Ten Towns council. He was bothered by [[Easthaven]]'s rise to prominence and resentful of [[Bryn Shander]]'s existing prominence and what he saw as its manipulations to maintain that position and keep the other towns in its shadow. While not hostile to any of the other Speakers, he rejected any proposal that he thought would make Targos subservient to another of the Ten Towns.\n\nIn addition, he stood among the Dockworker's Guild's leaders.{{Cite dungeon/220/King of the Wolves|33}} While Targos might lose some of its competitive edge, Giandro reasoned it would gain greater influence and make Targos the equal of Bryn Shander.",
        "History": "He was a Targosan born and bred.\n\nDuring his leadership in the {{yearlinkName|1485}}, Targos, and the Ten Towns as a whole, were faced with an attempt by Luskan's [[Arcane Brotherhood]] to take political power via [[Vaelish Gant]], an influx of items crafted out of [[black ice]] that corrupted their owners, and the increasing powers of the cultists of [[Auril]].<ref>"
