'''Sn첫t''' was a [[goblin]] messenger in the [[Northdark]] of the [[Underdark]].

==Personality==
Sn첫t was easily terrified and betrayed his clients if his life was in danger.

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], [[Iyelle Tlabbar|a female drow from Menzoberranzan]] paid Sn첫t to send a message to a group of [[deep gnome]]s saying that a group of drow slavers would soon arrive at the [[Passage of Old Mines]] (in truth they were adventurers hired by [[House Xorlarrin]], [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]], and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] on their way to the [[Sezz'ia]] outpost).
