Snùt was a goblin messenger in the Northdark of the Underdark.
Snùt was easily terrified and betrayed his clients if his life was in danger.
In 1479 DR, a female drow from Menzoberranzan paid Snùt to send a message to a group of deep gnomes saying that a group of drow slavers would soon arrive at the Passage of Old Mines (in truth they were adventurers hired by House Xorlarrin, House Melarn, and Bregan Daerthe on their way to the Sezzia outpost).
