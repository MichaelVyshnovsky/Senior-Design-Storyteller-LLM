        "mainbody": "'''Copperbloom''' was one of the elder spiritual leaders of the [[Lost Vale Tribe]], the [[saurial]] community in the [[Dalelands]], the mate of saurial hero [[Dragonbait]] and the mother of their offspring - [[Handful]] and two other hatchlings.",
        "Description": "Copperbloom looked like a typical [[finhead]] saurial. When she was performing her [[priest]]ly duties in the [[Singing Cave]] - a Temple of Finder Wyvernspur, she was adorned in the typical [[robe]]s of the [[Church of Finder Wyvernspur]] - simple but elegant garments, guided by the dogma that the outfit of the performer should not outshine the performance. When Copperbloom was on the road, she wore practical and simple travelers' clothes. Thankfully, like most other saurials, she relied on natural defenses of her scales.{{Cite polyhedron/119/Forgotten Deities: Finder Wyvernspur|23}}",
        "Personality": "Copperbloom was a kind and gentle woman with keen intelligence. She often lovingly scolded her deity Finder when the fledgling deity made mistakes. Like with many other followers, Finder was friends with his clerics and devotees.",
        "Abilities": "Apart from being a competent cleric with access to divine magic and blessings of [[Finder Wyvernspur]], Copperbloom was a talented poet, musician, and songwriter. Her talents were respected among saurials and [[human]]s. Her religion was focused not just on change and the evolution of music but also on individual change. She embraced that aspect of the church and quickly mastered [[Common]] language (reading, writing, and understanding, however, her saurial physiology stopped her from speaking in the alien language).",
        "Relationships": "Copperbloom shared her spiritual leadership status with [[Sweetleaf]], and older bladeback [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] and the goddess of fertility and agriculture from the saurial homeworld. Together, the woman guided and trained eight acolytes who, like their superiors, worshiped Finder Wyvernspur and Chauntea.",
        "History": "Copperbloom was one of the unfortunate saurials who were snatched from their world by the desperate god of rot [[Moander]] who transported Dragonbait's tribe to a hidden vale on the edge of the Dalelands in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. Copperbloom and her kin were enslaved by the god's foul magics and forced to build a giant avatar for the deity - the ''[[Abomination of Moander]]''. The saurials were forced to sacrifice their eggs to the pile of rot and refuse. Eventually, the Lost Vale Tribe was freed by hero companions of Dragonbait - [[Alias]] of the ''[[azure bonds]]'', [[halfling]] \"[[bard]]\" [[Olive Ruskettle]], [[Turmish]] [[wizard]] [[Akabar Bel Akash]], his wife [[Zhara]], and the Nameless Bard himself, [[Finder Wyvernspur]]. The heroes triumphed at a heavy cost. Akabar Bel Akash gave his life to stop the rotting god, and Finder seemingly perished in the magical explosion. In reality, Finder was given divinity of the dead deity and reached apotheosis. The saurials were convinced to stay in the Vale by [[Elminster]] who offered them protection and home as they repaired the damage done to the land. In the years that followed, Copperbloom took on the mantle of Finder's High Priestess in the newly constructed saurial temple and found a mate in the hero Dragonbait.\n\nBy {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Copperbloom was a mother of her and Dragonbait's child who was aptly named [[Handful]]. Her priestly duties expanded as she gained young followers. Copperbloom trained the young acolytes who generally were brought to the Church of Finder due to their love of music. Some of the young followers of Finder were young ''soul singers'' of the Lost Vale Tribe. As the tribe's spiritual leader, Copperbloom was in charge of greeting and welcoming pilgrims who visited the Lost Vale's temple. Eventually, her family welcomed two more hatchlings.{{Cite dragon/292/Lords of the Lost Vale|37,43}}\n\n1368 DR also marked the time when Finder's favorite follower and friend - [[Joel]] the Rebel Bard made the pilgrimage to the Singing Cave while on a quest to retrieve the ''[[Hand of Bane]]''. Copperbloom met the young cleric with a basket-full of flowers and guided him with her kindness and wisdom."
