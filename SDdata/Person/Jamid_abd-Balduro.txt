Jamid abd-Balduro was an elven warrior who traveled across the deserts of Zakhara with her fathers caravan around 1367 DR.
Jamid was a muscular woman with very long, black hair. She had tall cheekbones, dark lips, and an earring in her right ear. She wore a golden helmet and red dragonscale armor.
In addition to her dragonscale armor, Jamid owned a scimitar of wyrm-slaying.
Jamid fell in love with a human caravan worker. When her father, Balduro, discovered the romance, he killed the man out of anger. Fearful for her life, Jamid killed her own bodyguard and fled the caravan.
