'''Kolssed''' was a [[human]] merchant-turned-hermit who wandered the wilderness along the [[Sword Coast]] in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]].

==Description==
He had the appearance of a corpulent man.

==Personality==
Kolssed was an outgoing, friendly sort. He found the hermitic lifestyle relaxing, but struggled with the social isolation aspect.

==Possessions==
Being a hermit, Kolssed owned nothing of value, and as such was mostly left alone by [[bandit]]s.

==History==
Kolssed was a successful merchant in the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Nashkel]]. After losing everything as a result of the [[iron crisis]] of 1368 DR, he became a wandering hermit. When the [[Bhaalspawn]] known as [[Gorion's Ward]] escaped [[Candlekeep]], Kolssed was one of the first people to run into them. He offered the Ward advice, and warned them of two nearby unpleasant fellows: the [[Zhentarim]] agents [[Xzar]] and [[Montaron]].
