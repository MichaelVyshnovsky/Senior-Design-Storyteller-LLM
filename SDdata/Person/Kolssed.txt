Kolssed was a human merchant-turned-hermit who wandered the wilderness along the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR.
He had the appearance of a corpulent man.
Kolssed was an outgoing, friendly sort. He found the hermitic lifestyle relaxing, but struggled with the social isolation aspect.
Being a hermit, Kolssed owned nothing of value, and as such was mostly left alone by bandits.
Kolssed was a successful merchant in the Amnian town of Nashkel. After losing everything as a result of the iron crisis of 1368 DR, he became a wandering hermit. When the Bhaalspawn known as Gorions Ward escaped Candlekeep, Kolssed was one of the first people to run into them. He offered the Ward advice, and warned them of two nearby unpleasant fellows the Zhentarim agents Xzar and Montaron.
