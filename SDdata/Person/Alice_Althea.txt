==Description==
Alice was a [[wood elven]] woman with fair skin tone with greenish tints. She had light short bob hair and was dressed in dark green finery.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Alice found herself contemplating a purchase of a freshly reanimated [[zombie]] from Sorcerous Sundries. The [[undead]] was created by the shop's in-house [[duergar]] [[necromancer]] [[Cordrane the Recent]]. However, Alice was unsure if the price of a zombie servant was worth it.
