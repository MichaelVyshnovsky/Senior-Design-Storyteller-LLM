        "mainbody": "'''Gathlarue''' (also known as Gathlarue the Wonder Wizard) was a [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She kept her gender a secret from the rest of the Zhentarim.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|232-233|14}}",
        "Description": "She sounded older than her apprentices.",
        "Personality": "Gathlarue was dissatisfied by her apprentices.",
        "Possessions": "She carried a ''[[ring of teleportation]]'', until [[Tespril]], her apprentice, filched it. At the time of her death, she wore a dark robe. She also wore an amulet that protected her against all poisons, almost certainly a ''[[periapt of proof against poison]]''.\n\nShe also bore a scrying element, a round sphere of crystal, through which she saw not just events but also thoughts to which she responded, strongly implying it was almost certainly a ''[[crystal ball]]''{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|63-64|3}} with ''[[detect thoughts]]''.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|148|8}}\n\nGathlarue carried a number of enchanted rings that glowed blue when activated; those were destroyed soon after.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|172-173|10}} She controlled [[gargoyle]]s{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|170|10}} through such rings.",
        "Abilities": "She could cloak herself in a male disguise with her Art. She also knew of a blood spell that had bound her apprentices to her, letting her sift their thoughts at will.\n\nAmongst other spells, she knew one to make herself capable of flight, almost certainly ''[[fly]]'', one to arrest her falls, almost certainly ''[[feather fall]]'', and a spell that created barriers capable of blocking [[spellfire]] which her apprentice Tespril knew as a \"forcewall\", almost certainly a ''[[wall of force]]''. One of her spells allowed her to control [[darkenbeast]]s, almost certainly ''[[create darkenbeast]]''. She could send visions to distant people.",
        "Relationships": "Her apprentices were Tespril and [[Mairara]], the latter being also the eldest.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/02-06 - Women in the Zhentarim}}\n\nShe avoided [[Karkul Memrimmon]], and was aware of the goings-on around the search for spellfire. Amongst other things, she was aware of the deceits of [[Ghaubhan Szaurr]].",
        "History": "At some point, Gathlarue had explored [[Myth Drannor]], where she'd found a ''[[portal]]'' atop a roofless tower leading to a hidden redoubt, where she'd discovered numerous spellbooks, likely including ''wall of force''. In {{yearlink|1357}}, she joined the hunt for spellfire after participating in the meeting in which [[Sarhthor]] and [[Manshoon]] explained the hunt for Shandril Shessair.\n\nThroughout the hunt, she scried on Shandril constantly.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|95-96|5}} She later employed magic to send visions to [[Ramath]], while scrying on Ghaubhan Szaurr, whom she hoped to send after Shandril.\n\nShe decided to attack finally at [[Irondrake Rock]]. During the attack, she sent waves of gargoyles before attacking herself; her attack was short-lived, and unsuccessful. She protected herself from the spellfire with a ''wall of force'' or similar spell, but by attacking the cliff atop her, Shandril was able to bury her under rock.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Per [[Fzoul Chembryl]], Gathlarue wanted the Brotherhood ruled by women instead of men, and he was aware and dismissive of her disguised gender."
