'''Iosefa Elgin''' was a scholar of the [[church of Deneir]] who famously attempted to recreate the ''[[Metatext]]'', the divine source of knowledge sacred to her faith.

==Activities==
Iosefa made it her life's work to scribe the tome entitled ''[[Metatext: Rebound]]'', an attempted recreation of the Deneiran ''Metatext''. In that book she described various subjects, including the topic of [[resurrection]] and the nature of the [[soul]].

==History==
Deneiran clergy believed that her actions were entirely heretical. For her efforts, Iosefa was permanently exiled from the church of Deneir.
