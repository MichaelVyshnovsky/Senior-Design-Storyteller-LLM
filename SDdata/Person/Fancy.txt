'''Fancy''' was a retired circus [[horse]] living in [[Marigold's Menagerie]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Prior to being brought to Marigold's Menagerie, Fancy was an animal performer at the [[Mooney & Sons Circus]].

==Activities==
Fancy shared her stable with another retired circus mare, [[Gypsy (horse)|Gypsy]]. Both of them preferred to graze in the exercise yard, rather than eating the straw that was provided to them. Both were trained to do tricks, but [[Marigold Mufflefoot]] seldom allowed them to perform when exercising due to their old legs being so brittle.
