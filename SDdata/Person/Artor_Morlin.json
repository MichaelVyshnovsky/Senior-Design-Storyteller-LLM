        "Personality": "As an immortal creature who had been living in the same place for well over four centuries, Artor had to create several personalities for himself to remain incognito. In this, he lacked imagination as every one of his personae was a mercenary captain.{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|63}}\n\nHe was a wary individual, He would try to observe his foes and send his [[vampire spawn]] or other minions to deal with threats instead of confronting them himself. He therefore preferred to avoid notice wherever possible and maintain his public identity so that he could spend his free time hunting. After his expulsion from the [[Dungeon of the Crypt]], he spent the next three decades anxiously waiting and watching for signs that people had forgotten about the existence of the Dungeon and that he was still out there.\n\nArtor spent a small fortune on [[bloodroot]] in order to suggest an addiction to the drug. The purpose of this was to suggest a weakness that enemies would think to exploit and thus reveal themselves. The ploy was successful in drawing out the [[Malar]] worshiping vampire, [[Dhusarra yr Fadila el Abhuk]].{{Cite dungeon/126/Vampires of Waterdeep: Blood of Malar|63}}\n\nHe was a pragmatic tactician and strategist who was determined to never lose a fight. He would never intentionally put himself in a position where there was any doubt of his absolute victory. He spent a small fortune and several years of unlife researching all of the inherent weaknesses of a [[vampire]]'s condition just so he could cover all of his bases if an opponent ever tried to exploit even one of them.\n\nHowever, if ever he found himself in a situation where he had to draw sword and enter the fray, his bloodlust took over and he reveled in the chaos and blood of combat.",
        "Relationships": "Artor didn't maintain many relationships for a centuries-old person. He preferred to kill his allies after a certain number of years and make new ones rather than keep the same ones around for a long time. He maintained a coterie of vampire spawn, the last of whom that were documented being [[Arrick Kaarvol]], [[Fhang]], [[Rorrina Stoneshaft|Rorrina]] of [[Clan Stoneshaft]] and a [[medusa]] named [[Medechai]] who was his favorite.\n\nHe had made several acquaintances in his time, including [[Halaster Blackcloak]], whom he first met before he became undead when Halaster was still known as Hilather. Of his true friends though, there were very few, though it was known that [[Durnan]] was one.\n\nThrough Fhang, Artor had a connection to the [[Unseen]]. He also had connections within the [[Church of Loviatar]] and the [[Shadow Thieves]].\n\nHe was closely connected to the [[Gost]] family of Waterdeep, in a relationship dating back for centuries. In the late 14th Century DR, [[Djarrus Gost]] was his ''[[Dominate person|dominated]]'' puppet (a fact that would've shocked Djarrus' vampire-hunting half-sister [[Corinna Lathankin]] if she'd ever found out). Artor maintained dominated servants that were connected to the [[church of Lathander]] in order to supply information to the church about rival vampires which would then be destroyed by church-sponsored vampire hunters.",
        "Possessions": "* Artor wielded a ''+2 [[Vampiric (weapon quality)|vampiric]] two-bladed sword'' in combat that he named ''[[Shoonfangs]]''. He frequently coated it in [[purple worm]] poison. It was also the key to a ''[[portal]]'' that linked the [[Fireplace Level]] to the Morlin Catacombs underneath [[Castle Daggerford]] - Morlin's emergency escape route.\n* Artor wore a [[mithral]] chain shirt called ''[[Artor's Armament]]''.\n* He also kept a 6 inch (15 cm) [[bloodstone]] gem, carved into the shape of a bowl that would fill with blood on command.\n* Artor's coffin was finely carved black [[marble]] and worth thousands of [[gold pieces]] to a collector.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|88}}\n* Artor acquired one of two known copies of the ''[[Workbook of Lhoril Delhiirnyn]]'' that contained extensive research on summoning [[demon]]s and a list of treasures seen in [[Ahghairon's Tower]] before it was spellwarded.\n* A pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]''.\n* A ''[[kiira]]'' that contained the spells ''[[analyze dweomer]]'', ''[[contact other plane]]'', ''[[moment of prescience]]'', ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'', and ''[[vision]]''.\n* Twin ''[[dagger of venom|daggers of venom]]'' decorated with [[jewels]], stolen from the noble [[Sultlue]] family of Waterdeep.\n* A book describing religious rituals of the [[yuan-ti]].\n* A pair of dueling swords won by defeating a young scion of the [[Silmerhelve]] noble family. Artor posed as a rival and acquired a ''[[rapier of puncturing]]'' and a ''[[luck blade]]'' (with no [[wish]]es left).\n* Artor had a large collection of treasures from the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]]{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|63}} including a suit of ''[[red dragon|red]] [[dragonhide]] [[full plate]]'' armor once worn by a [[helmed horror]] made by the Shoon court mages.",
        "Biography": "The first documentary evidence of Artor Morlin placed him as a loyal mercenary guard in the court of Qysar [[Shoon III]] at [[Shoonach]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Wrinkle in the Weave|6}} Despite being quite aware of the Qysar's younger brother wishing to supplant his employer, Artor, through no fault of his own, was too late to save the Qysar's life during the coup against Shoon III in the {{YearlinkName|130}}.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/A Wrinkle in the Weave|10}}\n\nArtor became an infamous [[Shoon Imperium|Shoon]] outlaw who worked as a mercenary from the 2{{nd}} to 10{{th}} century [[Dale Reckoning]]. Famed for his hatred of all things [[Calishite]], he took to harassing Calishite trade caravans. He built [[Morlin Castle]] on what is now the site of the town of [[Daggerford]] and proclaimed himself Baron of [[Steeping Falls]] and Lord Protector of the [[Sword Hills]] in the {{YearlinkName|133}}.<ref>\n\nAt some point, he fell to evil and became a powerful vampire.{{Cite adventurers league/The Hero of the Troll Wars|5}} He continued to harass Calishite caravans in the south, seemingly uncaring that his realm disintegrated in [[403 DR]],<ref> he allowed his castle fall to ruins during the [[Second Trollwar]] in the {{YearlinkName|940}}, around which time he disappeared. He only returned when he heard that [[Ducal Castle|Castle Daggerford]] was being built on top of the ruins of his home in [[947 DR]]. Artor, discovering the burgeoning settlement of [[Waterdeep]], ignored [[Daggerford]]'s development and instead moved his coffin to Waterdeep.\n\nArtor was the first vampire to take up residence in Waterdeep and built the [[Dungeon of the Crypt]] just north of the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]].\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1035}},<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Purging the Blood|2}} Artor made a deal with Open Lord [[Ahghairon]] in which he promised to keep Waterdeep free of vampires other than him himself, in exchange for assurances that he would have a say in how the city was ruled.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Purging the Blood|5}} As a result, Artor would become one of the [[Lords of Waterdeep#Masked Lords|Masked Lords]] of the city.<ref>{{cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|2}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1131}}, Artor found himself fighting an [[undead]] horde in the [[Fields of the Dead]] that almost destroyed the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Here, he encountered the [[grisgol]] form of [[Hazamir al Aktorral]], whom he abducted and entombed within his lair.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/131/Prison Mail|12}}\n\nHe dwelt in the Dungeon of the Crypt for almost four centuries, keeping the citizens of Waterdeep safe from other vampires per his agreement with Ahghairon. In the {{YearlinkName|1341}} though, the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] chanced upon and defeated him. Artor managed to stay just out of reach of the adventurers in the [[Fireplace Level]] and eventually moved his coffin there. After a decade had passed, he had a vampiric servant move back into his old lair to test whether people would actually remember that he was never destroyed or not. Every five years he would kill his servant, create another and send them to perform the same task. The fourth such servant, a doppelganger named Fhang, was intended to be the last such imposter before he would return in person to the Dungeon of the Crypt. However, in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a vampire of [[Undermountain]], [[Dhusarra el Abhuk]], decided to challenge Artor for the privilege of using the city of Waterdeep as a private hunting ground. In Dhusarra's ignorance, she failed to comprehend her blunder, but in so doing, had invoked the divine interdiction of a [[Malarite]] [[High Hunt]], trapping herself in the city along with Artor, who was a far more powerful vampire than her. When Dhusarra realized her mistake, she managed to get another group of powerful adventurers involved to save her own hide by hunting for Artor.{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|64}}\n\nLike with the Company of Crazed Venturers, Artor survived his encounter with the adventurers sent after him, but he decided to abandon his old redoubts and eventually moved into the crypts beneath the Gost mausoleum in the City of the Dead. Another century passed. In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} the leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], the [[drow]] [[Jarlaxle]], learned of the existence of a powerful potential rival based out of the Gost crypts. Rather than be distracted trying to learn more about this rival, and expend resources getting rid of them himself, Jarlaxle commissioned numerous fake treasure maps that lead to the mausoleum, and distributed them to other treasure hunters and adventuring types, banking on his rivals eliminating each other for him.<ref>{{cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|2}} Artor eventually decided to allow one of these groups sent against him to live with the knowledge of his undead state, in exchange for them stopping the distribution of the fake maps to his lair, confident that he could murder them if betrayed. These agents were successful, but enough maps remained in the city that Artor decided that he had to find another new lair.<ref>{{cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|10}}\n\nAt first, he decided that he would move into the [[Dungeon Level]] of Undermountain, and temporarily moved to [[Skullport]] while that was being set up, but troubles with other undead in Undermountain eventually caused him to settle on making the far deeper level of [[Shadowdusk Hold]] his new lair.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Moving Day|11}}\n\nHis last secondary lair was a reserve crypt beneath the [[Gost villa|villa]] of the [[Gost]] family."
