        "mainbody": "'''Kith''' was the youngest member of the all-female adventuring [[Company of the Swanmays]] ''circa'' [[1350 DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Kith had told her that Syluné was at least a century old but kept young with her magics. Alias had always suspected that Kith planned to use her power toward the same goal, improving and maintaining her looks. The thought put a smile on her face...''|Excerpt from ''[[Azure Bonds]]''.}}",
        "Description": "Kith was blessed with the beauty of youth unspoiled by the rough adventuring life. Her lovely features often left others feeling inadequate and plain. Kith had long often plaited chestnut-colored hair.",
        "Abilities": "Kith was a [[wizard]] in training tutored by [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]] of Shadowdale during the Swanmays many stops there. Presumably, Kith continued her training with the river witch until Syluné's death.",
        "History": "Before Swanmays' alleged disbandment ''circa'' [[1350 DR]], Kith, along with the rest of the Swanmays adventured around [[Suzail]], the [[Dalelands]], and surrounding regions. When they earned their living by guarding and guiding trader caravans through [[Cormanthor]], they often passed through [[Shadow Gap]] and stayed in the [[North Gate Inn]]. When seasons changed, they spent their winters in [[Shadowdale]], enjoying the warm company and strong drinks with [[Jhaele Silvermane]] at the [[Old Skull Inn]].\n\nAt some point, Kith came to apprentice under the river witch of Shadowdale, Syluné, who taught the young lady to read, write, and the arcane arts."
