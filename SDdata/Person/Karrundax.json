        "Activities": "The young red dragon claimed an [[earthmote]] that floated within the caldera of Mount Hotenow as her lair, but also maintained one in the caverns that extended out from the subterranean [[River of Flame]].",
        "Relationships": "Karrundax formed an alliance with the fire giant [[Gommoth]] after he formed the [[cult of Maegera]] within Mount Hotenow. She allowed them to utilize a portion of her lair in exchange for the protection of her brood, requesting that the [[fire giant]] mercenary [[Pyraphenia]] serve as her personal guardswoman.\n\nAs a token of camaraderie, Gommoth bestowed upon Karrundax the [[Hand of Maegera]], an [[elemental]] that he and his cultists created.",
        "History": "[[File:Karrundax Overhead.png|thumb|right|300px|Karrundax flying over Mount Hotenow]]\nSome time around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Karrundax' brood of eggs hatched, spawning at least five red [[wyrmling]]s. \n\nKarrundax and her offspring were slain by the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, around the time of the dissolution of the cult of Maegera."
