        "mainbody": "Pilster Pebblehuck was a halfling baker in Elturel in the late 15 century DR.\nHe and his wife Merrywile had three children.\nWhen the whole city of Elturel was transported to Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells, in the , Pilster and his family hid in their bakerys basement. When their food started to run out, Pilster ventured into the streets to look for supplies, but was discovered in an alleyway by an imp. But Perchillux offered Pilster a deal enough food for a month in exchange for his very soul. Desperate, Pilster considered signing the convoluted contract printed on parchment made from halfling skin. Adventurers might have intervened then, possibly determining the contract to be a trap that would have given Perchillux not just Pilsters soul, but those of all his family, and slaying or scaring the imp off."
