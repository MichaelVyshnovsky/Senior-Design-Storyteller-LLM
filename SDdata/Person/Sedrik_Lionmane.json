        "mainbody": "Sedrik Lionmane was a human fighter adventurer from the Quoya Desert in the Hordelands, active in the 14 century DR.\nSedrik hailed from a poor village on the edge of the Quoya Desert. Many locals believed that he was a bastard son of some nobleman. However, the noblemans identity was not known. By the age of sixteen, Sedrik Lionmane proved to be a talented fighter and a natural-born leader. Confident of his skills, the sixteen-year-old peasant hero left home to travel across the Realms and earn coin to improve the lives in his hometown.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Greenwood was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
