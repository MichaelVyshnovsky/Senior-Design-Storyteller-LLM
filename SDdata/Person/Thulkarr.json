        "mainbody": "'''Thulkarr''' was a war-leader of ancient [[Raumathar]] during the [[Great Conflagration (war)|Great Conflagration]].",
        "History": "Taking advantage of [[Narfell]]'s weakness following battles two years prior, Thulkarr led an army of unstoppable [[Maug (construct)|stone constructs]] against them in the {{YearlinkName|-154}}.<ref group=\"note\">The Great Conflagration started in {{Yearlink|-160}}, and the account on page 55 of ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' suggests that Thulkarr's invasion occurred 6 years into the war. Attacking from the north, the army used ''[[portal]]s'' to outflank and overwhelm their enemies and their [[demon]] servants. When the Nar were pushed back to [[Narjast]], Thulkarr's successes drove [[Ayarch]] [[Rauthok]] to petition the [[Nentyarch]] to unleash their last resort: the [[Dark Fissure]], which involved opening multiple ''portals'' to the [[Abyss]] in order to open a [[plane|planar]] rift. This plan was enacted when Thulkarr's army arrived at [[Dun-Tharos]], and the resulting rift caused the army of constructs to vanish and be imprisoned on [[Acheron]]. It was unclear what happened to Thulkarr in the wake of this crushing and disorienting defeat, but any Raumathari survivors fled the battle using [[magic]]."
