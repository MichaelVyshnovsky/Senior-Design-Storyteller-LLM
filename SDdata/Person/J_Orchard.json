The artificer's gravestone had a single inscription: \"J Orchard. Artificer of Gond, crafter of odd sockets.\" J's grave may had been accidentally desecrated, and their body animated as a [[zombie]] by [[Nina Dortmell]], a talented child with a gift, who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother."
