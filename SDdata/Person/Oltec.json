        "mainbody": "ltec was the able captain of the City Guard of Waterdeep circa 1358 DR. He greatly helped to uncover the identity and whereabouts of the evil beholder, Xanathar, as well as the secretive Darkmoon temple.\nIn 1358 DR, the guard captain managed to capture a drow spy who had been teleported to Waterdeep by the crime lord Xanathar. Under interrogation, the dark elf revealed that he was indeed working for Xanathar, who was an evil beholder, and inhabited the lower sewers under the city. The drow spy also carried a map of the lower reaches of Waterdeep, as well as notes detailing the traps and monsters of the area. Khelben Arunsun took the package from Oltec and gave it to the adventurers who would become the Heroes of Waterdeep, who in turn used this information to help slay Xanathar.\nAfter the fall of Xanathar, Oltec and his guard unit made a routine patrol searching for lost travellers. Oltec came across the remains of an overturned carriage, and the driver, who had been slain by an arrow to the heart. After evaluating the crime scene, his tracker followed a trail of blood from the carriage to reveal another clue a deep footprint, as if someone were carrying a passenger away after the attack on the cart.\nOltec and his unit, after a tiresome search, came across a small box containing the bound journal of the scholar and architect, Wently Kelso. Oltec had mixed views on Kelso, who had troubled him somewhat in the past, but who had also been helpful in finding clues about Xanathar. The guard captain decided it would be best to examine Kelsos journal, which turned out to be fruitful. The journal contained notes on evil occurrences around Waterdeep and humans found in shallow graves.\nThe guard captain had his sources confirm that Kelso was seen riding in a carriage the same night of the attack. Kelso had also spoken to many people about investigating a new mystery. Oltec had a scribe copy the relevant entries, and attached them to a letter that he sent to Khelben Arunsun. Khelben then assigned the Heroes of Waterdeep to search the area to the north and west of the city where the events in Kelsos journal occurred. The heroes used the information Oltec had recovered to uncover the mystery of the threat, which turned out to stem from the evil Darkmoon temple."
