'''Harnoth''' was, together with his twin brother [[Bromm]], one of the Twin Kings of [[Citadel Adbar]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century. He was a son of the famous [[Harbromm]].

==History==
During the [[orc]] and [[drow]] invasion in the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, Harnoth and his brother were tricked by the [[half-drow]] [[Doum'wielle Armgo]], who posed as an envoy of the [[Moonwood]]. Bromm and a dwarf army were led into an ambush where all the dwarves were killed and the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]], ridden by [[Tiago Baenre]], slew Bromm with its cold [[dragon breath|breath]].

Harnoth also died during the war, but the city's elders, in fear of turmoil, hired a [[doppelganger]] to impersonate the king without anybody noticing.
