Harnoth was, together with his twin brother Bromm, one of the Twin Kings of Citadel Adbar in the Silver Marches in the late 15 century. He was a son of the famous Harbromm.
During the orc and drow invasion in the War of the Silver Marches in the , Harnoth and his brother were tricked by the half-drow Doumwielle Armgo, who posed as an envoy of the Moonwood. Bromm and a dwarf army were led into an ambush where all the dwarves were killed and the white dragon Arauthator, ridden by Tiago Baenre, slew Bromm with its cold breath.
Harnoth also died during the war, but the citys elders, in fear of turmoil, hired a doppelganger to impersonate the king without anybody noticing.
