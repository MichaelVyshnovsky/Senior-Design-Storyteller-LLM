==Relationships==
He bickered much with [[Mhegras]] during their assignment to the capture of [[Shandril Shessair]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|218|13}} [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]] counted him as the most formidable Zhent in the caravan.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|309-310|18}}

==Abilities==
One of his spells allowed him to cheat death in exchange for a live sacrifice.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|277-278|16}} He was likely the most formidable Zhentarim in the caravan.

==History==
Sabran joined the caravan from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] in which [[Shandril Shessair]] sought passage on late {{yearlink|1357}}. He presented himself as a weaver instead of a priest,{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|252-253|15}}

In the aftermath of the fight, they tried to capture Shandril while she was out of spellfire and knocked out, guarded only by [[Narm Tamaraith]], but decided against it when she woke up too soon. However, they were then ambushed by the [[Harpers]] [[Beldimarr]] and [[Arauntar]], who were posing as caravan guards, and got their necks broken.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|262-265|15}} This left them unseen to the [[Zhentarim]] scriers [[Hlael Toraunt]] and [[Korthauvar Hammantle]]. for much of a day.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|271|16}} Unknown to the Harpers, he survived thanks to a contingent spell.

He was slain during the caravan's next ambush, by [[Marlel]].
