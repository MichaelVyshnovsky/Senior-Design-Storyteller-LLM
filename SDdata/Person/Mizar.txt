Mizar was the label attached to a depiction of a supernatural creature, most likely a demon, represented in a fresco found in an Imaskari ruin within the border of Veldorn and Estagund. "Mizar" was most likely meant to be its name. The creature depicted resembled a midnight black centaur with a horn in the middle of its forehead, in the manner of a unicorn the eyes of the fresco showed hellish glee. The figure of an Imaskari artificer, labeled Umyatin, was reaching towards it.
