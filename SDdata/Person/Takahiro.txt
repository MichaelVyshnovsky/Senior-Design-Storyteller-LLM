Takahiro was a shogun of Wa who ruled around 1640 (1222 DR).
In the late 1630s, Takahiro forgave Eiji Toda, the young and inexperienced daimyo of Aru Province, for failing to stop the resurgent bandit attacks that devastated the pilgrim trains traveling to Aru. Then, in 1640 (1222 DR), a foreign raiding party (possibly from Shou Lung) made it to Arus outskirts and razed part of the Eta District. This failure was too great and Takahiro removed Eiji from office.
