        "mainbody": "Masakito was a human fighter of Kara-Tur in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHaving four older brothers, Masakito grew up feeling he had to prove himself and escape from out of their shadows. Thus, to win renown and fortune, he went on many missions and quests, no matter how dangerous or beyond his ability.\nHe once fought with the ninja Takako.This is inferred from the art used for both characters cards being reused from the cover of Night of the Seven Swords.\nMasakito wielded a katana."
