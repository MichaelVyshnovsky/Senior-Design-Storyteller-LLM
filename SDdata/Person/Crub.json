        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Crub join the cult's raid on the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn. He and his fellow devotees of [[the Absolute]] killed many [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers along with some innocent bystanders. They even managed to take some captives, who they marched off to nearby [[Moonrise Towers]].\n\nAfter the raid, Crub and two of his comrades spent their time playing a favored game, where they imagined the most greusome ways to kill an individual. They focused their attending on the Flaming Fist captain-turned-adventurer, [[Wyll]], the Blade of Frontiers."
