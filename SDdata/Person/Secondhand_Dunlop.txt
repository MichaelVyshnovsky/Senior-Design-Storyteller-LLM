{{quote|It's not much, but it'll help you last longer out there. If... erh, um... when you come back, just remember where you got them from. I'll always have some to sell you.|Secondhand Dunlop}}

==Activities==
Dunlop sold supplies—possibly secondhand—to people entering the dangerous, ruined district. He had a stall near the entrance to the district in the Tatters area.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Dunlop provided a few ''[[potion of healing|potions of minor healing]]'' to adventurers working for Private [[Hawthidon Faalwun]] to retrieve the stolen ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]''. He hoped they'd get back at the [[Nashers]] for running honest merchants out of the district.
