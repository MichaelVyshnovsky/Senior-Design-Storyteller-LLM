        "mainbody": "King '''Lamoth''' was the ruler of the city of [[Chessagol]] (later called [[Tsurlagol]]) in [[the Vast]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88â€“89}}",
        "History": "Around the early 7{{th}} century [[DR]], Chessagol recently came under the rule of King Lamoth and his newly royal family, though they were not considered legitimate. Lamoth sought to bolster the legitimacy of his line by marrying his children to the royal families of [[Cormyr]], [[Milvarn]], [[Westgate]], and others around the [[Inner Sea]], often by sending them to visit their royal courts.\n\nLamoth's [[Royal Constabulary]] discovered the notorious pirate [[Urthag|Urthag the Knife]] carousing in Chessagol and tried to arrest him. He escaped, but not before losing the sword ''[[Galathos]],'' a magic blade that turned out to have been forged in the ancient empire of [[Raumathar]] and lost during its fall. Galathos was given to King Lamoth.\n\nFinally, Lamoth successfully arranged a marriage between his daughter [[Elthia]] and Prince [[Bellodar III]] of [[Impiltur]]. Bellodar became king of Impiltur, and Elthia queen, in the [[642 DR|Year of Sifting Sands, 642 DR]]. ''Galathos'' was part of Elthia's dowry, and eventually became the traditional sword of the princes of Impiltur.",
        "Associates & Activities": "King Lamoth was famous for his enormous family, with six daughters and eight sons, and for always attempting to marry them off to other, older royal families. Among these was Princess Elthia, who married Bellodar III of Impiltur and later became its queen."
