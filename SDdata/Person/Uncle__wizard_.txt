==Personality==
The wizard known as Uncle was a recluse who did not maintain contact with people outside his keep, even family.{{Cite dungeon/26/The Inheritance|15}} He was also conscious about security, as he filled his moat with invisible [[spear]]s{{Cite dungeon/26/The Inheritance|11}} and had a secret escape route out of his keep.{{Cite dungeon/26/The Inheritance|26}}

==Possessions==
The wizard's most significant possession was [[Uncle's Keep]], a modestly sized but well-decorated building in the southern end of the Kryptgarden Forest. In his keep, he kept a number of guards and servants. He also had a stable full of livestock, which included a [[pony]].

He owned a magical [[mirror]] that could cause someone to be enthralled by their own reflection.{{Cite dungeon/26/The Inheritance|14}} He owned many other [[magic item]]s, including [[enchanted]] [[weapon]]s.

==Activities==
Before his death, the wizard lived a somewhat solitary life in his keep although he made regular visits to [[Red Larch]].

==Relationships==
The wizard had few relatives. He was married to a woman from Red Larch,{{Cite dungeon/26/The Inheritance|13}}

He occasionally thought about his distant niece or nephew, to whom he was considered 'long-lost,' and who inherited his estate after his death.
His keep made him a target of the [[Lostafinga]] tribe of [[hobgoblin]]s.

==History==
About five years before his death, the wizard saved the life of a [[Lords of Waterdeep|lord of Waterdeep]], who repaid him by granting him a tract of land in the south end of the Kryptgarden Forest, as well as a keep there and money.

Some time after, the wizard became married to a woman from Red Larch. His wife and their unborn child both died during childbirth.

Two years after the death of his wife, the wizard's keep was raided by a patrol of the Lostafinga tribe of hobgoblins. They killed his hirelings, and the wizard as well. As he bled out from a fatal arrow wound, his last act was to write a will in ink and his own blood, leaving the keep to a particular niece or nephew of his.
