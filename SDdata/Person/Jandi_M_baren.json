        "mainbody": "'''Jandi M'baren''' was an apprentice [[mage]] from [[Mulmaster]] whose primary skill was in setting and defeating [[magic|magical]] wards.  In [[1460 DR]], she met [[Gareth Jadaren]] and [[Ivor Beguine]] when they hired her master to determine the nature of a magic bracelet known as the [[Rythanko]].  She fell in love with Ivor and left her master's employment to travel with Gareth and Ivor to [[Turmish]].\n\nWhile on the way to Turmish, they found an abandoned [[dwarf|dwarven]] stronghold known as [[Jadaren Hold|Giant's Fist]] in an extinct volcano near [[Erlkazar]].  Gareth wanted to settle down in the stronghold and he convinced Jandi to use her knowledge of wards and the Rythanko to create impregnable wards on the mountain.\n\nIn [[1461 DR]], Gareth and Ivor's former firstmate, [[Helgre]], tracked them to Giant's Fist and strangled Jandi, making it look as though Gareth was responsible. Upon her death, Jandi was met by an agent of [[Sune]] who offered her the choice of continuing on to [[Brightwater]] or lingering on the Prime.\n\nOver the years, the tree Jandi had died under came to be called \"Jandi's Oak\", and boasted a small shrine where Gareth's descendants left small offerings. Sometimes, the offerings were replaced with mysterious, well-made crafts. It is not clear if the exchanges were made by a lingering Jandi, or by the vampires who inhabited the nearby woods.",
