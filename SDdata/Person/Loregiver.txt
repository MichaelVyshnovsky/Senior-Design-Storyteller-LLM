The Loregiver, also called the Handmaiden of Fate or the Maiden of Beauty, was one of the most prominent figures in Zakharan history, though some believed her to be nothing more than a myth.
Fate chose a beautiful young girl upon whom to bestow her knowledge. This girl, who was later called the Loregiver, penned the sacred scrolls that would one day become the basis for the Law of the Loregiver. She hid the scrolls within a cave in the desert, knowing full well that the people of Zakhara were not ready to receive the wisdom of Fate. The scrolls were found centuries later by a young man who eventually united Zakhara and became the first Grand Caliph.
