The '''Loregiver''', also called the '''Handmaiden of Fate''' or '''the Maiden of Beauty''', was one of the most prominent figures in [[Zakhara|Zakharan]] history, though some believed her to be nothing more than a myth.

==History==
[[Fate]] chose a beautiful young girl upon whom to bestow her knowledge. This girl, who was later called the Loregiver, penned the sacred scrolls that would one day become the basis for the [[Law of the Loregiver]]. She hid the scrolls within a cave in the desert, knowing full well that the people of Zakhara were not ready to receive the wisdom of Fate. The scrolls were found centuries later by a young man who eventually united Zakhara and became the first [[Grand Caliph]].
