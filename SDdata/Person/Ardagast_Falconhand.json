        "mainbody": "'''Ardagast Falconhand''' was the commander of the [[King's Scouts]] in [[Cormyr]] in the early 1200s [[DR]]. He was an ancestor of [[Florin Falconhand]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "Ardagast was very tall—about {{SI|6.5|ft}}, plus or minus—and svelte. He had a prominent aquiline nose, sparkling dark-blue eyes, and light brown hair that turned gray around his temples. His face was weathered from a life spent outdoors.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|77}}",
        "Personality": "He was a dour man of few words and quiet bearing.",
        "Abilities": "Ardagast was an excellent huntsman, trailblazer, and scout. He rose to the position of leader of the King's Scouts early in the reign of King [[Dhalmass Obarskyr]]. He favored a [[saber]] in battle and always had a number of [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]] on his person.",
        "History": "Ardagast was one of the witnesses to the heist of what became known as [[Waevor's Wagon]]—a well-guarded carriage that was carrying about 60,000 [[silver piece]]s for paying the stipends of the [[Purple Dragons]]. He was part of an armed escort for a [[Sembian]] envoy that was camped for the night when the wagon in question went hurtling past them in the dark, knocking down two of the nobles in the escort. Lord [[Nelnar Orthwood]] bid Ardagast to give chase, and the huntsman took a route that brought him within arm's reach of the careening wagon, only to be forced off his [[horse]] by a [[spear]] thrust from the back window of the vehicle. His armor saved him from being skewered."
