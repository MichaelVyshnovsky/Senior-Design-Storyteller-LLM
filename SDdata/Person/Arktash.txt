Arktash was an orc chieftain of the Il-Khan tribe that made its home in the Spine of the World, around the 14th century DR.
While a mighty warrior in their own right, Arktash obtained their position as leader of the Il-Khan tribe through guile, not strength. Arktash was an intelligent and shrewd leader.
Less than a year into Arktashs reign, the orc chieftain was slain by rivals. These usurpers felt Arktash had shown disrespect by not claiming power through force.
As a child, the blackguard Dorn Il-Khan greatly admired Arktash. He later used the fallen chieftains story as a cautionary tale in conversation with the Bhaalspawn known as Gorions Ward.
