        "mainbody": "Kortyl Rowanmantle was a knight and a member of the Rowanmantle noble family in Cormyr who rode with Princess Alusair Obarskyr. He was a brash youth.\nIn the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold orc band that had raided a caravan east of Eveningstar in six days of pursuit, theyd killed a hydra, a \"fire lizard\", and three chimeras. They were on a high meadow north of Startop Crag when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their dark naga master.\nAfterward, Kortyl teased Brace Skatterhawk over stories he was the illegitimate son of King Azoun IV. He claimed not to be afraid that Alusair might be listening, and lost his nerve when it turned out she was. She pushed him over to much laughter."
