Mahmud Ben Aziz was a half-elf living on Masud Jazayir in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR. He ruled a small town called Bandar al-Saadat.
Mahmud ruled with a relaxed grip. Some thought his decisions were corrupt, but he knew how to keep the important individuals of the town happy. Mahmud approached the law as a business and sold it to those who paid.
He created posts to deal with the daily affairs and ease his schedule.
Mahmud was the older brother of Karim Ben Aziz and father of Halima Aziz, both of whom lived in Banda al-Saadat.
