        "mainbody": "'''Walpur the Bonebreaker''' was a [[Sembite]] [[fighter]] who [[adventurer|adventured]] with the [[Stag Runners]] company in the late 1360's [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Walpur immediately stood out in any crowd, as he was over 7 feet tall and immensely strong.",
        "Personality": "He had a very simple and direct set of goals, which largely consisted of performing violence and earning money. He had no real principles beyond this, and was somewhat simple-minded and dense.",
        "Possessions": "Walpur wore [[splint mail]] and carried an enormous, shiny enchanted ''+3 [[hammer]]''.",
        "History": "Walpur was originally a underworld enforcer, but eventually transferred his skills to adventuring with the Stag Runners.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], he joined his allies at [[Thistleflame Keep]] for a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]]. The [[Bard|bardic]] entertainer [[Mendryll Belarod]] proceeded to sing an outrageous ballad that degraded Sembites, enraging the Stag Runners. Walpur and his friends then proceeded to attempt to beat some respect into Mendryll, only to be foiled by another adventuring party."
