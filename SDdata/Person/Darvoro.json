        "Description": "Darvoro was a pleasant man with light-colored hair and considered quite handsome.",
        "Activities": "Darvoro's Plates was a very successful business and Darvoro was a very rich man. The only thing his wealth could not buy was membership in the [[Onsruur]] (the council of lords that was the real power in Khôltar), and he was determined to become a member. The  twenty members of the Onsruur were each from a family that had held their seat on the council for hundreds of years and some of them were adamantly opposed to adding any new members. Darvoro spent most of his time trying to gain leverage with the Onsruur by hiring spies to infiltrate the Onsruur households, paying bribes to clerks and government officials, and scheming to drive a wedge into the impenetrable circle, all to no avail. The Onsruur that were aware of his plots found him amusing, especially the [[Khaundrove]]s."
