'''Jherald''' was a local businessman in [[Blackfeather Bridge (village)|Blackfeather Bridge]] in [[Featherdale]] who owned a small [[Jherald's general store|general store]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Activities==
Jherald's store was well stocked with an impressive variety of goods. Well aware that his was the only general store for a good distance in any direction, Jherald raised the prices of his wares to about one and a half times their value in [[Ordulin]]. Customers in dire need of supplies were forced to either pay the prices or do without whatever it was that they needed.
