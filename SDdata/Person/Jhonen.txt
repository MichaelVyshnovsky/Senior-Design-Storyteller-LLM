Jhonen was a fisherman who lived in Easthaven within the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale.
The young fisherman dressed in faded and worn clothing.
The sea spirit Elisia spoke of Jhonen resembling the great hero Aihonen, whom she loved, but could not tell Jhonen these feelings for risk of dissolving into water.
Around 1181 DR, Jhonens ancestor Aihonen fought the white dragon Icasaracht on Lac Dinneshere and slew the beast.
In Eleint, 1281 DR, Jhonen had strange dreams of a blue-skinned woman, but discovered the lady loved his ancestor and wanted Jhonen to have the shards of the Blade of Aihonen.
