'''Jhonen''' was a fisherman who lived in [[Easthaven]] within the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
The young fisherman dressed in faded and worn clothing.

==Relationships==
The sea spirit [[Elisia]] spoke of Jhonen resembling the great hero [[Aihonen]], whom she loved, but could not tell Jhonen these feelings for risk of dissolving into water.

==History==
Around [[1181 DR]], Jhonen's ancestor Aihonen fought the [[white dragon]] [[Icasaracht]] on [[Lac Dinneshere]] and slew the beast.

In [[Eleint]], [[1281 DR]], Jhonen had strange dreams of a blue-skinned woman, but discovered the lady loved his ancestor and wanted Jhonen to have the shards of the [[Blade of Aihonen]].
