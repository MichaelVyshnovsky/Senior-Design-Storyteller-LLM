'''Bosturo''' was a noted sage and keeper of the [[Muradi Lighthouse]] in [[Koryo]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Bosturo grew up in the [[Quang Muku Forest]], but came to be the Master of the Muradi Lighthouse in [[1308 DR]]. With dedicated service, he had held this position for 49 years by 1357 DR. At one point, he received a scroll of commendation from the ex-[[king of Silla]], and displayed it proudly in his studio.

==Activities==
As Master of the Muradi Lighthouse, Bosturo's duty to keep its lamp burning to warn ships of [[the flaming seas]] that lay off the coast of the southwestern tip of the [[Koryo Peninsula]].

In his spare time, he studied and wrote of the flora and fauna of Koryo. He was a particular expert on the less-familiar plants of Quang Muku, and many of the [[potion]]s that could be brewed or distilled from them. He would speak of his studies for a fee.

==Personality==
Bosturo was naturally rather lonely, and so was rather talkative when he had visitors. For a good conversation, he would even reduce his fee.

==Description==
Bosturo had never cut his hair in his life, so his braided gray hair was so long it swept the floor behind him.
