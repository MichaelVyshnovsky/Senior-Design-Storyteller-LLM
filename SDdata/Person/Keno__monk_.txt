Keno was the commander of the ghostly monk guardians of the Crypt of Durkon in Kara-Tur in the 14 century DR.
Keno carried the Key of Scholars—the key that unlocked the appropriately named Crypt of Scholars within the tomb of Nan Kung Chi.
Keno died many moons before the late 14 century DR. His undeath was spent guarding the Crypt of Durkon of Shou Lung. In the , Keno and his fellow ghostly sentries faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon. The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypts dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard. At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master Larloch, who sought the tombs magical treasure—the Claw of the Black Leopard. Unlike many other guardians, Keno offered the vampire and her companions passage if they were to aid the inhabitants of the Kara-Turan tomb to fend off the aberrant intruders.
