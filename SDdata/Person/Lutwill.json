        "mainbody": "Baron '''Lutwill''' was a self-appointed petty lord of a region southeast of the [[Starspire Mountains]] during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]].\n{{Quote|[[Zazesspur]] will reward me mightily when I send them your head preserved in [[vinegar]].|Baron Lutwill to [[Zaranda Star]] (She argued that it would be better preserved in [[brandy]].)}}\n{{TOC limit}}",
        "Description": "Lutwill was a very large man, standing taller than an [[orog]] with a large stomach. He had a squat nose and dark-colored eyes. He had dark hair, with bushy eyebrows and a thick mustache that grew back to his sideburns. He had a friendly sounding baritone voice.\n\nLutwill wore a [[hauberk]] and a [[steel]] [[Helmet|cap]] over [[Deer|buckskin]] pants, with [[boots]] made of scaled [[leather]] that might have been from a [[dragonet]]. He wore a thick [[bear]]skin vest over his armor that left his thick, muscular arms bare.",
        "Personality": "As revealed by the [[magic item|magic]] [[saber]] ''[[Crackletongue]]'', Lutwill was an evil baron. He enjoyed the company of women.",
        "Possessions": "Baron Lutwill owned the [[Castle Lutwill|castle named after him]]. He fought with a [[greataxe]].",
        "Relationships": "The chamberlain for Baron Lutwill was named [[Whimberton]].",
        "History": "Baron Lutwill claimed to have received his power from the city council of [[Zazesspur]]. In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, he sought to double the taxes on the villages in his lands with only seven days notice. On the night that he sent out his soldiers to collect the taxes, [[Star Protective Services]]&mdash;led by [[Zaranda Star]]&mdash;and a group of villagers from the region around Castle Lutwill stormed the castle.\n\nWhen Zaranda reached the penthouse and began to battle Baron Lutwill, they were equally matched until Lutwill's chamberlain, Whimberton, [[Hold person|held]] her with his magic. Lutwill considered whether to kill her immediately or to have his way with her. However, Zaranda's charge and apprentice, [[Chenowyn]], arrived, and surrounded Whimberton with [[summon swarm|magical shimmering lights]], which caused the [[wizard]] to fall through a window to his death. Zaranda was then free to move again. She kneed Lutwill in the groin, dodged his final swing, covered his head with a [[wolf]]skin, and then stabbed him in the face repeatedly."
