        "mainbody": "aron Lutwill was a self-appointed petty lord of a region southeast of the Starspire Mountains during the Tethyrian Interregnum.\nLutwill was a very large man, standing taller than an orog with a large stomach. He had a squat nose and dark-colored eyes. He had dark hair, with bushy eyebrows and a thick mustache that grew back to his sideburns. He had a friendly sounding baritone voice.\nLutwill wore a hauberk and a steel cap over buckskin pants, with boots made of scaled leather that might have been from a dragonet. He wore a thick bearskin vest over his armor that left his thick, muscular arms bare.\nAs revealed by the magic saber Crackletongue, Lutwill was an evil baron. He enjoyed the company of women.\nBaron Lutwill owned the castle named after him. He fought with a greataxe.\nThe chamberlain for Baron Lutwill was named Whimberton.\nBaron Lutwill claimed to have received his power from the city council of Zazesspur. In the summer of the , he sought to double the taxes on the villages in his lands with only seven days notice. On the night that he sent out his soldiers to collect the taxes, Star Protective Services&mdashled by Zaranda Star&mdashand a group of villagers from the region around Castle Lutwill stormed the castle.\nWhen Zaranda reached the penthouse and began to battle Baron Lutwill, they were equally matched until Lutwills chamberlain, Whimberton, held her with his magic. Lutwill considered whether to kill her immediately or to have his way with her. However, Zarandas charge and apprentice, Chenowyn, arrived, and surrounded Whimberton with magical shimmering lights, which caused the wizard to fall through a window to his death. Zaranda was then free to move again. She kneed Lutwill in the groin, dodged his final swing, covered his head with a wolfskin, and then stabbed him in the face repeatedly."
