At the end of [[1372 DR]] or the beginning of [[1373 DR]], [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] and his group, led by [[Quenthel Baenre]], sought out and repaired the ship in order to travel with it to the [[Demonweb Pits]] in search of [[Lolth]]. Pharaun was able to bind the uridezu captain with a locket and wax figurine, but Raashub's attempted to escape by summoning rats and [[gate|gating]] in his cousin [[Jaershed]]. The group defeated the attack, but with Raashub gone, Pharaun was forced to learn to control the ship of chaos himself (with the secret help of the invisible [[Aliisza]]).
