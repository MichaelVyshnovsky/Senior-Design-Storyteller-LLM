        "mainbody": "'''Fui D'hang''' was a general of the [[Shou Lung]] empire stationed at the [[Ginger Palace]] embassy on the [[Dragon Coast]] region of [[Faerûn]]\nduring the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Fui had stony eyes and seemed to always have a hardened expression on his face.",
        "Personality": "He was an officer who held commitment and obedience above all other virtues, and could carry out his duties with strict stoicism.",
        "Possessions": "The general wore [[leather armor]] that was covered with a large tunic along with a [[brass]] helmet lined with [[silver]].",
        "Activities": "Since the Ginger Palace was first constructed, General Fui served as the commander of the royal guards protecting Princess [[Wei Dao]].",
        "Relationships": "The general had a contentious relationship with Prince Tang, seething with hostilities that always seemed to exist beneath the surface of their banter. While Fui was the superior military commander, the prince believed himself he had the right to secure victory for the empire of Shou Lung.\n\nFui's son [[Yuan ti (person)|Yuan ti]] was an officer in the imperial army. The general pulled some strings to have his son stationed with him at the Ginger Palace, a cushy job that would keep allow him to keep an eye on his son.",
        "History": "{{Quote|General Fui is no longer bound to you by duty, Brave Prince. I call him earlier because I sense change in you that, perhaps, earns his respect. But it is difficult for him to be with us. Even most faithful of servants cannot stay long, and in the past you have done little to win his loyalty.|[[Lady Feng]], to Prince Tang.}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, General Fui and his men accompanied Prince [[Kao Chou Tang]] on a mission into the [[Nameless swamp (Dragon Coast)|nameless swamp]] in order to slay the [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil|Cypress the Black]]. During their journey along the waters of the swamp, both the general and the prince, along with their men chewed [[lasal]] leaves in order to protect their minds from the [[undead]] dragon's powers drawn from the [[Invisible Art]]. The leaves had the unintended effects of inciting anger and belligerence within the Shou men.\n\nIn his lasal haze, General Fui D'hang questioned the authority of Prince Tang to the point of insubordination, and was punished with an immediate death sentence. The prince inadvertently chose Fui's son Yuan Ti to behead the general. With his father's approval, the young officer followed orders and slew his father before they even reached the dragon's lair.\n\nAfter his death, [[Lady Feng]] sent the apparition of Fui's visage to guide Tang as the prince ventured out alone to save his mother from Cypress."
