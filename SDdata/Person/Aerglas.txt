Aerglas was a druid of the Emerald Enclave who lived in Goldenfields during the midâ€“15 century DR.
Aerglas was good friends with the treant Turlang. He was the "creator" of the awakened tree Lifferlas.
The elven druid was an adventurer during his younger years and was known to have slain many giants.
Sometime in the 1450s or 1460s, Aerglas made a pilgrimage to the Shadowtop Cathedral in the High Forest. His whereabouts thereafter were unknown to several of his friends and acquaintances.
