Pollus Windscreamer was the last known ruler of Jangling Hiter.
Pollus Windscreamer was a hamatula and the disinterested leader of Jangling Hiter, a city in Minauros.
Some time in the mid–14 century DR, Windscreamer still governed the hellish city. The majority of the population was made up of chain devils, which had an egalitarian society where they played the roles of brutal constables.
