        "mainbody": "'''Brian''', known as '''Brian the Swordmaster''', was a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Brian was bald with a black beard and a permanent scowl. His eyes were gray. As a swordsmith and armorer, he had a strong physique.",
        "Personality": "Brian liked to look at things directly and in a straightforward manner.",
        "Activities": "Brian owned a smith and shop in the [[Southern Ward of Waterdeep|Southern Ward]]. His home was located above the shop. He worked among the common folk of Waterdeep.",
        "Relationships": "Brian was one of the \"Like-Minded Lords\" in [[1364 DR]] ([[Mirt]], [[Khelben]], [[Durnan]], [[Nymara Scheiron|Kitten]], and [[Larissa Neathal|Larissa]]), who frequently met up to enjoy each other's company.)",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Brian and his fellow Lords of Waterdeep joined other leaders of [[the North]] in negotiations with Prince [[Aglarel Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]], to discuss the tentative alliance that had formed between the [[Shadovar]] and other cities like [[Evereska]] and Waterdeep. During the meeting Brian became enraged by Aglarel's presumption and arrogance, and he openly insulted the [[Prince of Shade]]. This slight led to Thultanthar's offer of a formal alliance being withdrawn and the promise of further aid to Waterdeep being rescinded."
