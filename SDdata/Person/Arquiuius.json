        "mainbody": "Arquiuius was a wizard in Thay.\nArquiuius was a reclusive wizard who took as apprentice the young orphan Halloran. He possessed a tower in the desert of Thay that leaned at an angle, but gravity magically in the tower made it so that anyone inside walked on the angled floors as though they were parallel to the ground like normal.\nAround 1351 DR, he tried a very difficult summoning spell that went wrong. The summoned monster broke free and killed Arquiuius and destroyed his tower while Halloran escaped."
