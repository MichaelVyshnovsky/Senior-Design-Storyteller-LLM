        "mainbody": "Glarasteer Rhauligan was a Harper agent, spy for Alusair Obarskyr, and merchant of elaborate turrets and spires in Cormyr during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nGlarasteer was a stoutly built and very strong man who dressed in rich silks and furs. He wore shaggy sideburns in the 1360s DR,\nAfter his encounter with the Grinning Ghost of Taverton Hall, he bore three bone-white marks on his forearm that stood out against his heavily tanned skin.\nGlarasteer had an easy and garrulous manner that verged on theatrical at times. He was an independent-minded and irreverent man, but remained perfectly calm and iron-willed when needed, and faced danger with his regular humor and irreverence.\nAs a merchant he was based in Suzail and traveled about Cormyr and Sembia, selling his services as a decorative roofer to the wealthy and tasteless. He gathered information as he went, keeping an eye and ear on both notable individuals and the overall moods and trends in those lands.\nGlarasteer was an old friend of the Harper Emthrara Undril, whom he believed to simply be a dancer. He was sometimes the lover of Alusair Obarskyr, and was an implicitly trusted personal agent that she relied on for accurate information.\nIn Eleasis of 1368 DR, Glarasteer visited Taverton Hall in his merchant guise, secretly serving as a Harper investigating the murder of Shamril Farrowbrace and Lord Eskult Paertrover. He worked alongside the imperious Wizard of War Lord Jalanus Westerbotham, and together they uncovered the perpetrator, the Seneschal Immult Greiryn. At the conclusion of the mystery he came face-to-face with the Grinning Ghost, who approved of his work defending the Hall and clasped arms with him, winning Glarasteer a set of white scars where the ghosts fingers had touched him."
