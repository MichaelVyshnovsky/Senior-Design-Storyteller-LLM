        "mainbody": "Lord Rivior was a bandit leader who commissioned dwarves to construct what would later become known as the Haunted Halls near the village of Eveningstar in Cormyr.\nRivior lived during the 12 century DR. He was slain by Enchara of Esparin when she tricked him and his starving followers into leaving the safety of the Haunted Halls during the heart of winter.\nRoughly two-hundred years later, in 1348 DR, the Swords of Eveningstar found a collection of unused healing potions hidden inside the Haunted Halls that were addressed to Rivior."
