        "mainbody": "'''Mestrel Hawkmantle''' was a [[bard]] and member of the [[Harpers]] of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "He was friends with [[Ormsel Eltunarr]], a Harper caravan-master based in [[Mulhessen]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Mestrel was very busy. First, he worked as a guard for a caravan carrying Harper messages from [[Baldur's Gate]] to [[Iriaebor]], where he found a [[Thay]]an spy. He foiled the spy's slaving operation and followed him to [[Westgate]], where Mestrel identified the spy's master and, with the help of a fellow Harper [[wizard]] from [[Suzail]], read the mind of the superior before killing him.\n\nThanks to the information gained, Mestrel ruined another slaving operation with the help of the adventuring party called the [[Shining Shield Band]], some novice fellow Harpers, and the deceived [[Pirates of the Fallen Stars (organization)|Pirates of the Fallen Stars]], taking the free slaves to [[Yhaunn]].\n\nIn [[Sembia]], Mestrel saved a priestess of [[Tymora]] from robbery, helped fix a wagon, beat a bully, and paid the debt of a veteran of the war against [[Lashan Aumersair]], and saved a widow from debtors in [[Saerb]] by masquerading as her dead husband.\n\nHe robbed and tricked a [[Cult of the Dragon]] cell, forcing them to battle the [[Zhentarim]]. Later, he sold some [[Zhent]] agents in [[Hillsfar]] to Lord [[Maalthiir]], unveiling Maalthir's plot to capture some Harper agents.\n\nIn the [[Vast]], Mestrel slew the evil wizard [[Rundleth Talhart]]. Though Rundleth was independent, Mestrel framed him as one of the Zhentarim. He later saved fifty slaves in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] from [[drow]] slavers.\n\nIn [[Lyrabar]], he exposed a cheating merchant before sailing to [[Aglarond]]. Later, Mestrel ruined a slaving business in [[Telflamm]] and after a trip to [[Rashemen]] he destroyed a bandit group near [[Murghôm]]. Afterward he was hired as a guard for a caravan headed to [[Kara-Tur]], but in the [[Glittering Spires]] the caravan was destroyed by [[vampire]]-led brigands. He found there a ghost town full of [[ghoul]]s and stepped through a ''[[gate]]''."
