        "Description": "Araj was a [[drow]] woman with a flirtatious personality and questionable morals. She was fully dedicated to her fallen house and the art of blood alchemy. Oblodra's blood was disgusting to taste to [[vampire]]s, possibly evidence of strange blood-mixing of cross-breeding with the [[mind flayers]] that was rumored to be one of the crimes of House Oblodra. Araj's obsession with blood also resulted in an overwhelming desire to be drained by a vampire, an act that gave her sublime pleasure.",
        "Posessions": "Araj's alchemist shop, the Crimson Draughts, was located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]], across the street from [[Beehive Goods and Wares]]. The shop carried a wide variety of [[potion]]s, bombs, alchemical ingredients, and some select [[enchanted]] items, such as a ''[[circlet of hunting]]'', ''[[boots of arcane bolstering]]'', ''[[ring of free action]]'', ''[[thunderskin cloak]]'', and many others.\n\nShe also developed a selection of potions concocted using the blood of various races, such as ''[[elixir of tiefling vice]]'', ''[[elixir of elven elegance]]'', ''[[elixir of halfling luck]]'', ''[[sanguine explosive]]'', and others.",
        "Relationships": "Araj Oblodra was familiar with the work of [[Jon Irenicus]] and how he was able to adapt the shape of [[Bhaal]]'s [[Slayer]] through a [[Bhaalspawn]]'s blood. She planned to offer an alliance with Lord [[Enver Gortash]] as the daughter of the most powerful House of Menzoberanzan in exchange for a supply of Gortash's blood to try and make [[Bane]] think of her as one of his [[Chosen]].",
