        "mainbody": "Aleena Paladinstar was the daughter of Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson. \nAleena was a tall and serious woman, often thought to be intimidating, despite being one of the most beautiful ladies of Waterdeep. The young woman inherited her chiseled facial features and stern bright eyes from her father. Aleenas mother gifted her with auburn curly hair and talent for the arcane.\nShe was stoic, independent, and highly capable, not letting anyone stand between her and her goals. She showed little interest nor patience towards chivalrous traditional ways of treating women. She spent her entire life proving that she was equal to any man and the last one who said that her true place was the kitchen was left \"digesting fireballs\". Aleena inherited her unwavering moral compass and sense of justice from Piergeiron.\nDespite being overprotective of his daughter, Piergeiron spent years grooming Aleena to take over as the Open Lord of the City of Splendors.\nAleena was the only child of Piergeiron the Paladinson and Maethiira, who died in 1344 DR. \nAleena married the wizard Savengriff.\nAleena once was the object of Eldoth Krons romantic attentions, and it was her fathers fury that caused him to flee Waterdeep.\nAleena used a quarterstaff in combat and was quite skilled with it.\nthumb|Aleena Paladinstar circa 1370s 300x300px\nIn the , Aleena put on her fathers armor and fooled people into thinking she was him, following an assassination attempt of the Open Lords life. She disobeyed Prigerions wishes and served as a distraction and a target. Despite being terrified for her fathers life and expecting the assassins to strike at her, Aleena maintained the illusion, hoping to lure the assassin out into the open, aiding Asper and Mirt the Moneylender who were on the case.\nSubsequently, Aleena secretly started apprenticeship with Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun and became a graduate of Blackstaff Academy. She traveled to the Yawning Portal Inn, in spite of her fathers orders, and was preparing for the descent with the Force Grey. However she still felt insecure and feared rejection because of her womanhood. During that time, several dire plots against Waterdeep brewed in the Undermountain and Aleena crossed paths with a hero known as the Khelbenite, hired by the Blackstaff to deal with the looming threats.\nIn 1371 DR, on Eleint 17 and 18, Aleenas father was to be wed to Eidola of Neverwinter. The wedding was interrupted by an assassination attempt on Prigerions life and the abduction of the bride. She was taken away to a newly resettled city in the Utter East. Open Lord fell ill shortly resisting all attempts to bring him to consciousness. Khelben Arunsun assembled a rescue team of the paladins present at the wedding as guests. Miltiades helmed the operation joined by Aleena. She also advocated for the noble youth who helped to save Prigerions life during the wedding, Kastonoph Nesher to join the group.\nBlackstaffs plan was to travel through Undermountain to reach the only known portal to the Utter East in the vicinity of the city. Khelben was unable to teleport the paladins to the portal directly because of Kerns anti-magical abilities, leaving the party with only one choice—traveling through Skullport.\nWhen Aleenas rescue team reached Skullport, the group was tasked with aiding zombies by the mysterious Skulls of Skullport in penance for destroying one of the floating watcher skulls. Lady Paladinstar was annoyed with the paladins dismissal of her expertise with the Skullports traditions that led to the confrontation with the Skulls. The group split apart in search of undead to aid. Aleena fulfilled the task given to the paladins by simply opening a door for a shambling zombie.\nAfter leaving Skullport, Noph insulted a group of ettins which provoked them to attack and ultimately caused Harloon’s death. Aleena helped the paladins to arrange a funeral pyre for Harloon using her magic. Nearing the gate, Able, Trandon and Noph went ahead to scout only to discover a magical mirror in the caves wall. It was being used by barlguras to duplicate themselves, creating an army. The scouts were discovered, Able was killed and Noph got captured by vrocks Shaakat and Rejik. They held him, hostage, to destroy the rest of the party. Aleena had an idea to create duplicates of themselves and send them into the fray keeping the fiends distracted. The vrocks killed the magical doubles one after another, playing straight into Aleenas plan. The surviving paladins were able to penetrate the fiends’ circle of protection against the law. The vrocks fled in defeat, and Aleena sent the paladins through the gate, closing it behind them by collapsing the tunnels ceiling with her magic.\nAleena and Blackstaff were aware of real Eidolas demise and the greater doppelganger who took her place and enthralled the Open Lord of Waterdeep to its will and life force via a soul gem. To bind the creature to its harmless form of a female noble, Aleena and Khelben crafted a powerful enchanted item – girdle of righteousness. They successfully tricked the creature into wearing it, but their plans were interrupted by the rushed wedding announcement and the kidnapping of the blushing featureless lizard creature bride. As Piergeiron collapsed, affected by mysterious magics, Aleena and her teacher devised a plan to retrieve Eidola and her fathers soul. When the paladins disappeared through the portal to the Utter East, Aleena returned to Blackstaff, and the duo continued working on the solution to the threat.\nSometime later, Aleena reunited with the paladins as they discovered the true nature of Lady Eidola and chased her through ancient Netherese gates back to Skullport. The young wizard and her allies raided one of the warehouses of the Unseen, the shadow masterminds being Eidolas attempt to enslave the ruler of Waterdeep. Eventually, the doppelganger was slain, and Aleena retrieved the magic diamond. Unfortunately, the heroes were too late, and the officials of the City of Splendors, pressured by Laskar Nesher, were burying the beloved Open Lord. Waterdeep was ready to say goodbye to its beloved Open Lord, buried beside his first love, Shaleen. Serendipitously, the reunification of the soul gem and Paladinsons body brought Aleenas father back to life. To everyones shock – his first wife was alive once again as well, as her soul was used to create the form of Eidola.\nSubsequently, after 1372 DR, Aleena spent years away from Waterdeep planewalking and visiting distant worlds. It was rumored that she would return to replace her father, the Open Lord of Waterdeep one day after his reign ended.\nEventually, Aleena and her husband Savengriff became prolific writers. In 1479 DR, Renaer Neverember possessed their entire body of mundane works, which included Aleenas Of Fathers, Faiths, and Fortunes (1403 DR)."
