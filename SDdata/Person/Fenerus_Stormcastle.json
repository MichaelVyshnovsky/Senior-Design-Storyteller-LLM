        "mainbody": "enerus Stormcastle () was a retired brigand-turned-spy who operated under the guise of a lamplighter in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.\nBeyond his work as a lamplighter, Fenerus spied on Waterdeep for agents of Luskan, who were in fact secret drow operatives of Bregan Daerthe. He provided information about current political decisions made in Waterdeep to his contacts in the City of Sails.\nFenerus was the founder of the infamous mounted bandit group known as the Blood Hawk Posse. He was ousted as the head of the gang after a failed raid and decided to retire in Waterdeep, where he unknowingly became the primary spy of Bregan Daerthe.\nIn 1492 DR, while under pressure from the Lords Alliance, the Lords of Waterdeep ordered the City Watch to arrest Fenerus for his past crimes.\nIf Jarlaxle managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, he entrusted the Stone to Fenerus. He hid the artifact before being arrested but to reveal the location Fenerus wanted to be released and have immunity for his past crimes."
