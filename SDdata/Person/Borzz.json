One note was placed on the board across from the [[Basilisk Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The advertisement claimed Borzz was highly proficient in stompin' [[rat]]s of all sizes, including [[giant rat]]s, but offered rat droppings and corpse disposal for an additional fee. Borzz the Ratcatcher offered referrals upon request."
