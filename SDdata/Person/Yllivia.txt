'''Yllivia''' was a scout and member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] in [[Phlan]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==History==
In [[1489 DR]], Yllivia asked for the help of her fellow [[Villonah Leadstopper]] to find a map showing a secret [[white dragon]] lair. The map was in the possession of the [[Knights of the Black Fist]]. During the investigation, they were captured by some corrupt members of the Black Fist, who imprisoned them in a secret prison where Black Fists tortured prisoners for sport. They were rescued by some adventurers hired by [[Rillo Leadstopper]], the father of Villonah.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|29}}
