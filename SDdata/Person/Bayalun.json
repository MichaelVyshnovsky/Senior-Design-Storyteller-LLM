        "mainbody": "The Lady '''Bayalun''' was the step-mother of [[Yamun Khahan]]. She was also a talented [[wizard]].",
        "History": "Bayalun was half-[[Maraloi]], being the daughter of a Maraloi woman and a [[human]] man.<ref group=\"note\">Page 105 of ''[[Horselords]]'' has a ''[[hu hsien]]'' assassin say that Bayalun's father was a Maraloi, but page 236 has Bayalun reminisce of the Maraloi as her mother's people. It most likely the hu hsien was simply mistaken. She grew up among them but married into the [[Tuigan]] people when she married [[Burekai Khan]], father of Yamun. \n\nShe ended being the step-mother of Yamun Kahan and one of the most powerful individuals at [[Quaraband]].\n\nWell-versed in the writings and philosophies of both [[Khazari]] and [[Shou Lung]], Bayalun was a powerful asset on Yamun Khahan's councils. She explained the [[Shou]] systems to the great khahan so he could better prepare and organize his [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|armies]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Bayalun conspired with some high dignitaries of [[Shou Lung]] to kill Yamun and seize the throne for herself with help by General [[Chanar]], but in the end Yamun survived the assassination attempt and decided to invade Shou Lung by breaking the [[Dragonwall]]. Bayalun was stripped of the [[khadun]] title and confined in a [[dead-magic zone]] room at Quaraband under control of [[Sechen Khan]].",
        "Relashionship": "In 1359 [[Aghul Balai]] of the [[Tsu-tsu|Tsu-Tsu]] was among the teachers, magical advisors, and agents of Bayalun. Aghul sought to convert Bayalun to [[The Way]]."
