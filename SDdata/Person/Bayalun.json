        "mainbody": "The Lady Bayalun was the step-mother of Yamun Khahan. She was also a talented wizard.\nBayalun was half-Maraloi, being the daughter of a Maraloi woman and a human man.Page 105 of Horselords has a hu hsien assassin say that Bayaluns father was a Maraloi, but page 236 has Bayalun reminisce of the Maraloi as her mothers people. It most likely the hu hsien was simply mistaken. She grew up among them but married into the Tuigan people when she married Burekai Khan, father of Yamun. \nShe ended being the step-mother of Yamun Kahan and one of the most powerful individuals at Quaraband.\nWell-versed in the writings and philosophies of both Khazari and Shou Lung, Bayalun was a powerful asset on Yamun Khahans councils. She explained the Shou systems to the great khahan so he could better prepare and organize his armies.\nIn the , Bayalun conspired with some high dignitaries of Shou Lung to kill Yamun and seize the throne for herself with help by General Chanar, but in the end Yamun survived the assassination attempt and decided to invade Shou Lung by breaking the Dragonwall. Bayalun was stripped of the khadun title and confined in a dead-magic zone room at Quaraband under control of Sechen Khan.\nIn 1359 Aghul Balai of the Tsu-Tsu was among the teachers, magical advisors, and agents of Bayalun. Aghul sought to convert Bayalun to The Way."
