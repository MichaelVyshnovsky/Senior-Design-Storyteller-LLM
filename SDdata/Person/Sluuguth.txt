'''Sluuguth''' was a roaming [[illithid]] who in [[1372 DR]] tried to take advantage of the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] by [[duergar]]s and [[tanarukk]]. 

He discovered in [[Lake Donigarten]] the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], [[Gromph Baenre]], imprisoned in a magical sphere after his defeat in a battle with Lichdrow Lord [[Dyrr]]. Sluuguth was convinced by Gromph to free him from the sphere using his psionic powers in exchange for great recompense. Gromph and Sluuguth traveled to the Archmage's quarters in [[Sorcere]], and Sluuguth tried to trick Gromph using "[[thought bottles]]" of his own design. Gromph defeated Sluuguth, sealing his soul into a magical axe.
