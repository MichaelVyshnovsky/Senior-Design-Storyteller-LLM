'''Arlon Bladeshaper''' was the leader of the [[Nashers]] faction of the [[Sons of Alagondar]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''I will set the Crown upon my brow and Neverember's lies, will be laid bare for all to see.''|A note written by Arlon Bladeshaper to [[Karzov]].}}

==Family==
Arlon claimed to be the great-great-grandson of one of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] who served [[Nasher Alagondar]].

==Personality==
Arlon was a charismatic, honorable and pragmatic person, who believed that the end justified the means. However, he also suffered from stress and was frowning all the time. He was described as taciturn and serious.

==Description==
Arlon was considered a handsome man.

==Abilities==
Arlon was a warrior of considerable skill.

==Activities==
Arlon was the leader of the aggressive faction of the Sons of Alagondar insurgent movement, the Nashers. Although he resorted to violence, he did so because he genuinely believed it was the only way to depose the tyrannical rule of [[Dagult Neverember]], as Arlon had [[Neverwinter]]'s best interests as a priority.

==Relationships==
He was aided in his endeavors by his lieutenant [[Karzov]].

==History==
After the death of [[Cymril]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Arlon took the leadership of a few Sons of Alagondar and founded the Nashers faction. Although at first he was leery of embracing an aggressive stance against Lord Neverember, he was convinced by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] to abandon Cymril's methods and embrace a darker path. It was Arlon who took the decision to ally the Nashers with the [[Thay]]ans and the [[Dead Rats]] of Neverwinter, although reluctantly.

A few months later, Arlon supported at first the self-proclaimed "[[Seldra Tylmarande|Lost Heir]]" of the [[Alagondar]] line. However, when the "Lost Heir" began to incite a civil war among the citizens, Arlon joined forces with a group of [[adventurer]]s hired by Lord Neverember to stop the "Lost Heir", as he believed that a civil war was not the best for Neverwinter.
