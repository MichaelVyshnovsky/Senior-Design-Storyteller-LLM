        "mainbody": "Skuthosiin \"the Venomous\" was a fiendish green dragon and one of Tiamats chosen.\nSkuthosiin was born to the dragon Chathuulandroth. He was invested with a third of Tiamats divine power during the Time of Troubles but was devoured, along with Gestaniius, by the bearer of another third, Tchazzar.\nDuring the Dracorage, he was resurrected by Tiamat and sent to the Methwood to create an army for Tchazzar, who was now his ally.\nIn 1479 DR, Skuthosiin organized the ash giants of the Black Ash Plain into an army to invade Tymanther. The army was driven back into the plain and Skuthosiin was killed by dragonborn led by the paladin Medrash and Vanquisher Tarhun."
