'''Edwall Dest''', was a Duke from the town of [[Spandeliyon]] in [[Aglarond]] sometime before [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Duke Edwall Dest lived sometime between the years of the {{YearlinkName|1170}} and the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. For several years, the man was locked in a bitter rivalry with the Duke of [[Delthuntle]], the man who was only remembered as [[Raymond]]. Eventually, their antagonism reached its climax in a sharpshooting competition. The winner of the competition was to be declared the superior [[archer]] between the two. Dukes Raymond and Edwall both wielded powerful [[enchanted]] [[bow]]s. Raymond's weapon, later known as ''[[Dead Shot]]'', was stolen by orders of the Duke of Spandeliyon before the competition. Edwall entered the shooting match confident in his advantage, exulting in his inevitable victory. However, Duke Raymond planned a surprise of his own. He demanded his opponent demonstrate his proficiency in sharpshooting on a scarecrow that bore an eerie resemblance to Edwall Dest himself. The Duke of Spandeliyon aimed and sent an [[arrow]] straight at the dummy's head. He did not miss and split the target's head in two. At the same time as the [[effigy|poppet]]'s head split, so did Duke Dest's.
