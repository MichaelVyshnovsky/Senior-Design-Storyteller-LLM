Kurr was a gnoll fang of Yeenoghu in the Labyrinth in the late 15 century DR.
Kurr suffered from a peculiar form of demon lordâ€“spread madness he felt guilty for all the people he had killed. He hoped to find someone who could kill him and his pack.
Circa 1486 DR, Kurr led his pack of hyenas into the Labyrinth searching for Yeenoghu. He had them feast on the corpses of his slain victims, transforming them into gnolls. They wandered the area and Kurr succumbed to madness.
