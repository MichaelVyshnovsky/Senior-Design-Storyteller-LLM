'''Lord Priest Tremain Belde'ar''' was a high-ranking [[priest]] of [[Tymora]] who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Living as a widower, Tremain was father to a boy named [[Casson Belde'ar|Casson]], as well as guardian of the young [[Varci Roaringhorn]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Casson and Varci both snuck into the [[Water Queen's House]] to cause a little trouble. The boys were both caught during their escapade, and only Varci was able to run away. Casson was killed for trespassing on holy ground, an offense whose severity was well understood by Tremain.
