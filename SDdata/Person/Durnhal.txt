'''Durnhal''' was King of [[Corwell]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the mid-to-late 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|26}}

==Relationships==
He and his queen, [[Morgan (queen)|Morgan]], were the first [[human]] monarchs of Corwell to use the Great [[Bear]] as their standard, making them the forebears of the [[Kendrick]] family.

==History==
Durnhal came to rule Corwell following the end of the long rule of the [[Hugh Dynasty]]'s last regent, [[Cedric Riker]], in the {{YearlinkName|272}}.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|32}} At this time, many of the lords of the [[Ffolk]] squabbled amongst each other rather than follow the High King, and King Durnhal was among those lords who were less cooperative, inviting antagonism from High King [[Gwylloch]].

In the {{YearlinkName|295}}, King Durnhal and Queen Morgan were captured by Gwylloch's son, Price [[Ketheryll]], and his [[Doomed Legion]]. They were accused of high treason, and then executed alongside other captives at the [[Castle of Skulls]]. Ketheryll kept their [[gold]] [[signet ring]]s as trophies.

Over a millennium later, tales and legends still recalled the royal couple, and speculated that their deaths had been the catalyst for the [[curse]] that ultimately befell Prince Ketheryll. In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, the [[halfling]] [[adventurer]] [[Pawldo]] and his companion [[Stefanik]] entered the Castle of Skulls seeking treasure. They escaped with the lost royal signet rings, and planned to gift them to High King [[Tristan Kendrick]] and his queen, [[Robyn Kendrick]].
