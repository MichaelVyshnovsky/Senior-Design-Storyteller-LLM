'''Nimbaud''' was the highest-ranking member of the [[Zhentarim]] left in [[Zhentil Keep]] during late [[1368 DR]].

==History==
Nimbaud chose to remain in Zhentil Keep in 1368 DR when [[Manshoon]], sensing [[Cyric]]'s plan, decided to relocate most of the Zhentarim, himself included, to the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. Nimbaud, hoping to impress the senior wizard, volunteered to remain behind to control the situation and command a small group of Zhentarim wizards. Thus the Zhentarim could say that they had not abandoned the Keep.

On [[Marpenoth 29]] of [[1369]], Nimbaud helped the high cleric [[Fzoul Chembryl]] to bind the [[pit fiend]] who was impersonating [[Orgauth]], the wizard believing they would soon inform [[Manshoon]] of their discovery. Instead, Fzoul and [[Abarax]] slew Nimbaud, established Orgauth/Abarax on the Council of Lords and appointed him as Lord of Zhentil Keep. Nimbaud was replaced by a [[baatezu]] to prevent his death from disturbing day-to-day operations within the keep.
