        "mainbody": "'''Ippen''' was an early [[cleric]] of [[Gond]], who was later canonized by the [[Church of Gond]] as a saint of their faith.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"saint\">The sourcebook with the most detail on Ippen, ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', does not explicitly state that Ippen is a saint. Instead, this comes from them being the namesake of ''St.'' Ippen island. They were referred to by the Church as being Gond's \"first great cleric\"",
        "Reputation": "* Ippen was notably the namesake of [[Ippensheir]], the sole calendar-related festival of the Church of Gond. Ippen was said to sometimes appear before Gondar clergy in need during this time.\n* When missionaries from [[Lantan]] traveled to [[Maztica]], they named the largest island in the [[Green Sisters]] archipelago after them, [[St. Ippen (island)|St. Ippen]]."
