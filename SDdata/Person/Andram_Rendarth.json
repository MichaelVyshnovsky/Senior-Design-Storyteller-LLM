        "History": "On orders from [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]] to slay Elminster and retrieve a part that could be used to identify the body, Andram Rendarth was part of an ambush set for [[Elminster Aumar]], a fugitive [[wizard]], in {{yearlink|1479}}, when the latter snuck into [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]] again, after stealing the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]'' earlier in the year. During that ambush, Andram Rendarth used a deadly spell, bolstered by consuming and unweaving wards in the castle, against Elminster and his companion, [[Storm Silverhand]]. That was extremely painful, but did not kill them. He later sent one of his underlings, [[Rorskryn Mreldrake]], who had already faced Elminster earlier during the raid at [[Tethgard]], to check if the man remained in one piece. Elminster quickly countered with an [[enchanted]] [[wand of paralysis]], which froze two war wizards, missing Rorskryn; Elminster voiced his extreme displeasure that Andram Rendarth had unwound the wards, and the fact that Ganrahast had obviously signed off on that.\n\nA watching [[Manshoon]] shared Elminster's displeasure, and decided Rendarth had to be slain, to give Ganrahast the message that the wards were to be left alone.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|123|12}}"
