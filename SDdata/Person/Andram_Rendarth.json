        "mainbody": "ndram Rendarth was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had a firm voice.\nHe knew how to consume wards to bolster magic.\nHe was a War Wizard of Cormyr.\nOn orders from Ganrahast Aeiulvana to slay Elminster and retrieve a part that could be used to identify the body, Andram Rendarth was part of an ambush set for Elminster Aumar, a fugitive wizard, in , when the latter snuck into Castle Obarskyr in Suzail again, after stealing the Royal Gorget of Battle earlier in the year. During that ambush, Andram Rendarth used a deadly spell, bolstered by consuming and unweaving wards in the castle, against Elminster and his companion, Storm Silverhand. That was extremely painful, but did not kill them. He later sent one of his underlings, Rorskryn Mreldrake, who had already faced Elminster earlier during the raid at Tethgard, to check if the man remained in one piece. Elminster quickly countered with an enchanted wand of paralysis, which froze two war wizards, missing Rorskryn Elminster voiced his extreme displeasure that Andram Rendarth had unwound the wards, and the fact that Ganrahast had obviously signed off on that.\nA watching Manshoon shared Elminsters displeasure, and decided Rendarth had to be slain, to give Ganrahast the message that the wards were to be left alone."
