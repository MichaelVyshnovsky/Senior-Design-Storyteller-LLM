'''Arlathna''' was one of the [[elf|elven]] [[mage]]s who fell at the hands of [[Horaundoon|Horaundoon the Eater-of-Mantles]] of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[1348 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, an ambitious [[wizard]] from [[Zhentil Keep]] named Horaundoon developed a type of [[magic]] that allowed him to tap into ''[[spell mantle]]s'' and drain their knowledge and [[spell]]s, incinerating the target in the process. Horaundoon targeted elves due to his hate of the Fair Folk. Arlathna was among the victims. [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Dove Falconhand]] were acquainted with the elven mage and were ordered by the Lady of Mystery to helm the investigation of her strange death. Elminster theorized that a strange possessing [[spirit]] or a Zhent [[wraith]] was to blame.
