He went missing during the search, prompting the Crown of Cormyr to send agents to look for him. The last person to see him was a serpent lord who saw him go down a crevasse along the road.\nActually, Sabkhat el Talab had died near the center of the lifedrain effect created by a phaerimm spell within the crevasse."
