The term \"man-at-arms\" has been adopted based on the description in the [[Tantras (adventure)|''Tantras'' adventure module]]. The term \"warrior\" is similarly possible from both the module and the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' (2nd edition)]].",
        "Possessions": "Regular soldiers of the Guard were outfitted in blue oiled [[plate mail]] armor emblazoned with the coat of arms of Tantras: three silver stars over a silver breaking wave on a field of royal blue, called the \"blue and silver\". They carried [[spear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[dagger]]s. Some, crossbowmen, could carry [[light crossbow]]s.",
        "Activities": "These soldiers patrolled in units of fourteen, led by a [[Generic Guard sergeant (Tantras)|sergeant]]."
