Nib Addlespur was a spellcaster who lived in the region of the Sword Coast North around Phandalin during the late 15 century DR.
Nib was not one to do something the simple way, preferring complicated schemes to basic plans.
She was an avid gambler, and often found herself betting on a "sure thing".
Wherever she went, Nib carried with her a deck of Three-Dragon Ante cards.
Nib adored birds, and even had a pet goldfinch called Lil.
