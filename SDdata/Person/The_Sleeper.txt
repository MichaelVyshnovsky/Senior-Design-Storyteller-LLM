'''The Sleeper''' was a female [[tarrasque]] and one of the ''nyama-nummo'', the offspring of the deity [[Olurobo]] in ancient [[Katashaka]].<ref group="note">The ''nyama-nummo'' are named after elements of the [[Wikipedia:Dogon religion|religion of the Dogon people of Mali]], with the concept of ''nyama'' (roughly, human nature) and the [[Wikipedia:Nommo|Nummo]] spirits or deities. However, what they could be in D&D terms and in the Forgotten Realms setting is unknown.<ref group="note">While the Sleeper is not defined in the text of the passage on page 30 of the ''The Grand History of the Realms'', the accompanying image shows a tarrasque, with the caption "The Sleeper awakens". However, the art in ''Grand History'' is all reused from prior sourcebooks and often inappropriate. Nevertheless, in the original fan-work ''A Grand History of the Realms'', an entity called "Tarrasque" who reigned over Katashaka is mentioned. Moreover, the name ''Tarasajok'' is suggestive of the tarrasque. Thus, it is assumed a tarrasque, or something very like one, was indeed intended.

Believed to be the greatest of the ''nyama-nummo'', the Sleeper dwelled in the Palace of the Alliz-Dren. She reigned over the lands of the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] tribe of [[human]]s and supposedly favored them over the other tribes. In turn, they chose one of their own at birth to be named ''Tarasajok'', meaning "She Who Watches over the Sleeper"â€”and who had the honor of being first to be eaten by her upon awakening on the next Night of Feasting.A Night of Feasting occurs at "the millennium end", suggesting they occur once every thousand years, but the sleep schedule of a tarrasque is generally noted to be unpredictable and more frequent.

In Tabaxi legend, one season, the Sleeper desired vengeance against an ancient enemy and summoned the greatest warriors of the nine tribes to follow her into battle in [[Mhairshaulk]] (c. {{Yearlink|-34800}} to c. {{Yearlink|-24000}}). Apparently defeated, the Sleeper returned in a rage, went on a rampage, and devoured four other ''nyama-nummo'' on the Night of Feasting, before finally returning to sleep and recuperate in the Palace of Alliz-Dren. She would awaken twenty-three more times, and ever more angry and hungry.If this is every thousand years, then a span of 23,000 years is covered, and the battle occurred around {{Yearlink|-25800}}, which is within the time of Mhairshaulk when dominated by [[yuan-ti]].

Finally, on the next Night of Feasting at the end of a millennium, before {{Yearlink|-2809}}, the current ''Tarasajok'', [[Oyai]] was blessed by [[Ubtao]] and empowered with magic. This was right before the Sleeper awoke with a roar and came to devour her. But she used the magic to halt, crush, and slay the Sleeper. That night, many liberated and joyous Tabaxi pledged themselves to Ubtao and thereafter journeyed across the sea to [[Chult]].<ref name=TGHotR-30/>
