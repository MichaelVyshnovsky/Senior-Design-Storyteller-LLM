        "mainbody": "Summerheigh was a druid who lived in a lone stone hut near the massive tree in the Resurrection Gorge of Amn in the 14century DR.\nSummerheigh wore light blue garb.\nShe was welcoming to the strangers and offered them a roof, food, and drink, as well as traded with them.\nAs a druid of Silvanus, Summerheigh possessed some sway of over beasts and fey of the Resurrection Gorge.\nBy the , Summerheigh had spent her entire life in the Resurrection Gorge. Some years before 1369 DR, Summerheighs son, Vernus, a powerful druid in his own right, performed a ritual at the heart of the gorge in an attempt to reach the Beastlands, the planar home of his beloved deity. The ritual went awry, and instead, he opened a gate that allowed a powerful fiend to step into the Resurrection Gorge. To stop the creature, Yarrow, the great trees dryad, bound the fiend to the gorge. The fiends influence twisted and poisoned the nature around the prison. The aged druid believed that the trapped creatures poisonous influence could, with time, spread and affect the entirety of Amn, reaching Athkatla and Esmeltaran. Summerheigh did not know the creatures nature and planned to venture into the gorge to find out, when her life would be close to an end."
