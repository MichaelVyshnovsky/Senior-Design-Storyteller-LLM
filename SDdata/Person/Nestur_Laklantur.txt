Nestur Laklantur was the Royal Cook of the Low Kitchen in Castle Obarskyr, Suzail, during the late 15 century DR.
His backside was generously ample.
The Low Kitchen had at one point, a cream sauce with mushroom which smelled of nutmeg and lion meat which had been spit-seared and cut thickly, likely made under his supervision. It took him several hours to make a glazed manymeats pudding, and his sauce was lumpy, strongly implying those may have been the feats testing his abilities as a cook.
He was the Royal Cook of the Low Kitchen in Castle Obarskyr.
Nestur Laklantur was working in the Low Kitchen one day in , when the fugitives Storm Silverhand and Elminster Aumar accidentally fell into it, slipped all through the table, and bounced off his backside, pushing him into a pudding and ruining his cooking. He turned around with a ladle, against which Storms sword bounced, saving his life, and unleashing a blast of wild magic that converted the ceiling into a solid slab of sapphire. The slab shattered and fell, stunning everyone in the room.
