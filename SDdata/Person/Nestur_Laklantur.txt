'''Nestur Laklantur''' was the Royal Cook of the Low Kitchen in [[Castle Obarskyr]], [[Suzail]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
His backside was generously ample.

==Abilities==
The Low Kitchen had at one point, a cream sauce with mushroom which smelled of nutmeg and lion meat which had been spit-seared and cut thickly, likely made under his supervision. It took him several hours to make a glazed manymeats pudding, and his sauce was lumpy, strongly implying those may have been the feats testing his abilities as a cook.

==Activities==
He was the Royal Cook of the Low Kitchen in [[Castle Obarskyr]].

==History==
Nestur Laklantur was working in the Low Kitchen one day in {{yearlink|1479}}, when the fugitives [[Storm Silverhand]] and [[Elminster Aumar]] accidentally fell into it, slipped all through the table, and bounced off his backside, pushing him into a pudding and ruining his cooking. He turned around with a ladle, against which Storm's sword bounced, saving his life, and unleashing a blast of [[wild magic]] that converted the ceiling into a solid slab of [[sapphire]]. The slab shattered and fell, stunning everyone in the room.
