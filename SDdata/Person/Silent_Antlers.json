        "mainbody": "'''\"Silent Antlers\"''' was the name [[Elminster Aumar]] gave a mysterious entity he struck down in the {{yearlinkName|761}} at a hill near [[Tresset's Ringyl]].The name is used in capitals in the narration, but it is only from Elminster's perspective. The name is not ever spoken to refer to this mysterious entity.\n{{quote|Do you attack all who pass this way, or is this a personal favor?|Elminster to \"Silent Antlers\" in 761 DR}}",
        "Description": "The bizarre creature was [[stag]]-headed and bare, with wickedly long fingers. Its eyes were red.",
        "Personality": "While Silent Antlers didn't say much, it gave Elminster the impression it was bent on killing him.",
        "Abilities": "The creature's attack was heralded by the rush of a throng of shadow-like beasts of unknown nature; it seemed to reabsorb them later, strongly implying that they were created from it in some manner.\n\nIt cast a magical green [[ball lightning]], which could be rebounded. It could also take the lightning itself harmlessly, seemingly being resistant to [[spell]]s or to the lightning itself. It had some ability to respond to spells that created daggers, [[dispel magic|dispelling]] or otherwise cancelling them. Finally, it had a spell that allowed it to release blue flames from its hands, which was also a form of counterspell capable of breaching other spell-shields quite effectively. It seemed to have no defense of its own towards that attack.",
        "History": "On a spring day of the {{yearlinkName|761}}, the [[Chosen of Mystra]] [[Elminster Aumar]] spent a night on a hill near [[Tresset's Ringyl]], the ruin of a fortified town. He was attacked through the night by a number of shadowy beasts, which were followed by an unknown, speechless creature that Elminster dubbed \"Silent Antlers\". After a short spell-duel, he managed to slay it.\n\nUpon death, the creature's body crumbled to ash; whether this was because of the rebounded flame spell it cast or some inherent property of its body was unclear. Its passing also caused a change in the [[Ringyl]], a nearby castle, making a catafalque and casket burst out from behind a wall decorated with a carving of a pair of lips, which held 12 or 14 irregular stars around it. A rod that formed part of the arrangement then crumbled into dust, but was reclaimed and restored by the hand of an unseen woman,"
