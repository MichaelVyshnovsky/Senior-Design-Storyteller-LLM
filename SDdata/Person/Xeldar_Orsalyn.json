        "mainbody": "Xeldar Orsalyn was a Zhentarim fighter in 1374 DR.\nIn 1374 DR, Xeldar served as a bodyguard to a cleric of Bane named Livikus Arthantar on a visit to the Xûl-Jarak citadel in Thar on a mission to pay homage to the new orog warlord Thrull. In truth, Livikus mission was to determine if Thrull could truly unite all Thar and ally with Zhentil Keep in an attack on Melvaunt.\nLike Livikus, Xeldar truly believed in the possibility that Zhentil Keep would rule all north Faerûn."
