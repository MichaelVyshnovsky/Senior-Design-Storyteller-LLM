She famously wrote the ''[[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]]'', a tome on demonic lore. \n\nLater in life she created her own [[Domain of Delight]] in the [[Feywild]],",
        "Description": "[[File:Tasha2-5e.jpg|thumb|''Tasha in her study.'']]\nThe exact appearance of Iggwilv was unknown to many. Some described her as a ravishing beauty, while others claimed she was a bald and hideous crone.{{Cite book| author = [[Roger E. Moore]]| title = Return of the Eight| short_story = | date = May 1998| editor = [[Kij Johnson]]| publisher = [[TSR]]| ISBN = 0-7869-1247-2 | pages = {{{1|55}}}}} In fact Iggwilv was quite beautiful in her youth with raven hair that eventually went stark white. Even after becoming an archfey, she still retained a human-like appearance.",
        "Abilities": "During her stay in the [[Abyss]], Iggwilv became extremely knowledgeable about the political hierarchy and goings on between the various powers within. She was considered a master at [[summoning]] [[fiend]]s, planar exploration, [[necromancy|necromantic magic]], and later in life, gained command over [[fey]] beings.\n\nAs an archfey, Iggwilv was immortal and could not die from aging.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Iggwilv_and_demonomicon-3e.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Iggwilv and the ''Demonomicon''.'']]\nIggwilv had a vast collection of magic items, oddities and personal mementos that she kept within the [[Palace of Heart's Desire]] in her home plane of [[Prismeer]]. Notable among these were a [[Mirror of Heart's Desire|magical mirror]] that showed the individual gazing into it what they desired most in the reflection within; three [[jar of time|jars of time]], that displayed the visage of a being at three different points in their life, a magical [[Chess (game)|chessboard]] gifted to her by the [[archmage]] [[Mordenkainen]], and the [[vorpal]] [[greatsword]] ''[[Snicker-Snack]]''.\n\nOne of Iggwilv's most wondrous and powerful items was her ''[[Iggwilv's Cauldron|personal cauldron]]'', an [[artifact]] that she crafted with the assistance of her adoptive mother. It held two different forms and many magical properties, including the power to permanently 'freeze time' for everyone within a {{SIAdj|1000|ft}} radius. \n\nHer personal library held [[tome]]s that originated from across the planes. Notable titles included ''[[The City That Waits]]'', ''[[I, Lyzandred]]'', ''[[Kingdom of the Ghouls]]'', ''[[The Many Masques of Mith]]'', ''[[Nadir of Nessus]]'', ''[[Prophecies of Explictica Defilus]]'', and ''[[Thingizzard's Night Balloon]]''.\n\nOn her person Iggwilv wore a ''[[robe of the archmagi]]'' and an ''[[amulet of the planes]]''.

The [[enchanted]] [[robe]] was among the wizard's extensive collection of curios from across the multiverse, displayed in [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] in [[Westgate]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."

        "Relationships": "[[File:Iggwilv and Graz'zt-4e.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Iggwilv with her sometimes lover [[Graz'zt]].'']]\nIggwilv was considered one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse, on par with [[demon lord]]s.{{Cite dungeon/149/Enemies of My Enemy|41}} \n\nIggwilv had many confusing relationships with the [[demon prince]] [[Graz'zt]]. They were both lovers and enemies, their relationship constantly changing. Both have at various points been the consort, prisoner, and master to the other. While they had almost no trust between them, they also held no secrets from each other. Both Iggwilv and Graz'zt sought to use or betray the other, yet also supported or even rescued one another when in peril, and in their own twisted way, both genuinely shared a bond of love with the other. Iggwilv believed Graz'zt was the only demon worthy of her gaze while she was the only consort of Graz'zt that inspired feelings of jealousy (as evidenced when he attacked [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]).\n\nWhile held prisoner by Graz'zt in his plane of the abyss, Iggwilv bore him many children. Graz'zt quickly and securely placed them in various locations and protected their identities from any beings that could bring them harm.{{Cite dragon/414/History Check: The Iggwilv-Graz'zt Affair|1-5}}\n\nThe witch queen was an enemy of the [[Nine Hells]], owing partially to her interest in Graz'zt. She had a [[quasit]] [[familiar]] At one point she had four [[arcanaloth]] apprentices.{{Cite dungeon/150/Prince of Demons|64}}\n\nIggwilv was the adopted daughter of [[Baba Yaga]], the [[archfey]] sorceress known across the planes as the 'Mother of All Witches'. [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Skabatha Nightshade]], and [[Endelyn Moongrave]].\n\nFor centuries, Iggwilv was aided by the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] clerk named [[Kalimanzaros]], who remained unfailingly loyal throughout their many years together. During her time in the Feywild, Iggwilv garnered the aid of the [[high elf]] [[Raezil Uthemar]], who spied on other fey courts on her behalf. As Zybilna, she was known to sponsor at least two warlocks, the amenable old [[warlock]] [[Madryck Roslof]] and the kenku Kettlesteam.",
        "History": "[[File:Iggwilv WBW.png|thumb|right|250px|''Iggwilv the Witch Queen, as an [[archfey]].'']]\n{{Quote|I can't tell you how many times I've burned everything to the ground and started over.|Iggwilv, under her pen name ''Tasha''.}}\nIggwilv was born in the world of Oerth and was adopted by the witch Baba Yaga, at which time she was known as Natasha \"the Dark\". She became known later as Tasha, before adopting her alias of Iggwilv, although it was not clear whether any of those was her original name. It was at that early point that she was credited with inventing the ''Tasha's hideous laughter'' spell. \n\nAt one point she moved to [[Niflheim]], the second layer of [[Hades]].\n\nSome time later Iggwilv settled in the [[Abyss]] and immersed herself in the study of [[demon]]-summoning and lore regarding demonic spirits. She sought to garner more power for herself, but made many enemies among the chaotic fiends and fled to worlds beyond for her safety. Eventually, Iggwilv moved to her own [[Domain of Delight]], known as [[Prismeer]], in the [[Feywild]], where she ruled from the [[Palace of Heart's Desire]] in the guise of Zybilna. Over time she transformed into a fey being and refocused her studies on that newfound state of existence rather than demonology.\n\nShe was eventually betrayed by the three daughters of Baba Yaga, the hags of the Hourglass Coven, and their cronies in the [[League of Malevolence]]. who used the magic of her ''[[Iggwilv's Cauldron|personal cauldron]]'' to freeze in time the Witch Queen and many of her palace's other inhabitants."
