        "History": "Tekeli-li was once a mortal gnoll, who led his pack across the frozen lands of [[Icewind Dale]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1333}}, the local [[Reghedmen]] barbarians routed the pack, forcing them to flee across the [[Reghed Glacier]]. To ensure their survival, the pack sacrificed themselves one by one to their Fang Tekeli-li, granting him sustenance to live through the winter.\n\nTo the goddess [[Auril]], Tekeli-li's ravenous hunger represented the unending \"consumption\" of winter. Auril interred the vampiric gnoll within the [[Caves of Hunger]], imprisoning him in the ice of the Reghed Glacier as the passageway out froze over. He remained trapped there for over a century until a group of adventurers re-opened the passageway."
