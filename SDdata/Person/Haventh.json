        "mainbody": "'''Lord Haventh''' was a [[wine]] merchant and one of the members of the wealthy high society of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "At some point, Lord Haventh set his eyes and amorous ambitions on Lady [[Firelia Jannath]], one of the city's [[patriar]]s and a notable patroness of the arts. He was among suitors who fought for the lady's hand in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when her lover, [[Oskar Fevras]], was presumed missing or killedâ€”in reality, captured and enslaved by [[Zhentarim]] smugglers. Lord Haventh requested to give his condolences in person to Firelia, over a glass of red [[wine]] from the merchant's recent shipment."
