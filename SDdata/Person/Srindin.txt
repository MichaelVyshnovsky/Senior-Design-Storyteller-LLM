'''Srindin''' was once an [[elf|elven]] explorer in [[Anauroch]].

After a life of exploration and adventure across all the [[Realms]], Srindin retired in the Anauroch, where he discovered a hidden fertile valley. He built a small castle where he lived as a hermit. After his death, the valley was named after him and some adventurers arrived at Srindin's castle in order to find his treasure, but some fell magic protected the treasures.
