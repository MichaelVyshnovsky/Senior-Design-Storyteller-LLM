Srindin was once an elven explorer in Anauroch.
After a life of exploration and adventure across all the Realms, Srindin retired in the Anauroch, where he discovered a hidden fertile valley. He built a small castle where he lived as a hermit. After his death, the valley was named after him and some adventurers arrived at Srindins castle in order to find his treasure, but some fell magic protected the treasures.
