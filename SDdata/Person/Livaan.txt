Livaan was a power-hungry cultist of Tiamat, the The Dark Lady, active in the late 15 century DR.
Livaan was a dragonborn, who wielded flaming magics. She was adorned in ceremonial garb of the Cult of Tiamat.
Livaans ambition in service of Tiamat knew no bounds. As a shaman, she burned everything in her way, and the destruction fueled her magical powers.
