Ororonymilith, also known as The Vizier of Broken Thorns, was a bronze dragon vassal of the Empress Dragon Gauwervyndhal in Skelkor, Abeir, centuries before the Spellplague.
Ororonymilith was one of the vassals of Gauwervyndhal who were tasked with finding the thief who was hunting in the Dragon Empresss forest. Ororonymilith tricked another slave into revealing that the thief was Esham-Ana. When the bronze dragon went to the mines to arrest Esham-Ana, the other slaves rose in rebellion and killed Ororonymilith.
