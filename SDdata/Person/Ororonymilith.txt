'''Ororonymilith''', also known as '''The Vizier of Broken Thorns''', was a [[bronze dragon]] vassal of the Empress [[Dragon]] [[Gauwervyndhal]] in [[Skelkor]], [[Abeir]], centuries before the [[Spellplague]].

==History==
Ororonymilith was one of the vassals of Gauwervyndhal who were tasked with finding the thief who was hunting in the Dragon Empress's forest. Ororonymilith tricked another slave into revealing that the thief was [[Esham-Ana]]. When the bronze dragon went to the mines to arrest Esham-Ana, the other slaves rose in rebellion and killed Ororonymilith.
