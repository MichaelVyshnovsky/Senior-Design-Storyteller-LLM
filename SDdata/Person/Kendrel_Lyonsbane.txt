'''Kendrel Lyonsbane''' was a retired soldier of the [[Lyonsbane]] family that spent his later years as a military advisor after being forced to retire during the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
The former warrior savored skill in combat and militaristic prowess, and viewed artistic endeavors and emotional sensitivity as a form of "corruption".

He was a cruel and malicious man that resented the fact he could no longer fight in battle. He blamed others for his own misfortunes, along with the perceived weaknesses he saw in his own family.

==Relationships==
Kendrel was the 6{{th}} generation descendant of [[Kyle Lyonsbane]], the original member of their family that had been cursed as a [[werepanther]].

Kendrel was married to a caring woman named [[Cyndril]], whom had bore him four sons.

==History==
When Kendrel saw his ten-year-old son Kelemvor learning the arts from his nanny [[Tannith]], the senior Lyonsbane had her beaten and left for dead. He forced the military life onto Kelemvor, who used the horrid mistreatment of his caring teacher as inspiration for his training.

A few years later, the young Kelemvor began romancing an older girl named [[Lilianna]], whose love and appreciation of beauty were immediately captivating. In an effort to break Kelemvor's spirit and remove all feelings of joy, Kendrel personally began beating Lilianna. Kelemvor discovered this abuse and immediately attacked his father. While he could not physically stop his father as a mere young teen, Kelemvor's act of selflessness triggered the Lyonsbane curse and transformed him into a [[panther]]. Kendrel was slain by his son that day.
