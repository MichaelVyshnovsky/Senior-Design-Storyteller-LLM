{{quote|May the good favor of your deity accompany you as you turn these pages. And to those who do not wish me well for what I have done in revealing the mysteries herein, be aware that the hands of three defend me against hostilities—I stand within the shielding shadows of Lathander, Mystra, and Oghma. I regret nothing.|Sambranna Highstar, Ches 12, 1368 DR.}}

Sambranna undertook an extensive study of many of the great divine [[spellbook]]s of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], both cataloguing their [[spell]]s and compiling their histories and known powers, as well writing of the nature of divine magic. Sambranna did this to inspire faith and prove the true might of the priests of the Realms, and covered all the major faiths equally to avoid weakening any one by sharing its secrets. The seer worked long and tirelessly, searched even in [[Myth Drannor]], and presented queries even to the gods themselves. In this endeavor, Sambranna claimed to have the favor and protection of no less than three [[deities]]—[[Lathander]], [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], and [[Oghma]]—and was confident of their protection should any there be any reprisals for the work.

==History==
Sambranna conducted research in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, and wrote the preface to the work in a place called the Well of the Fallen there on [[Ches 12]].
