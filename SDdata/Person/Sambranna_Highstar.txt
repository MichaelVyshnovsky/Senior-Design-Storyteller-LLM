Sambranna Highstar, titled Seer of the Revealing Light, was a sage and seer of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The sigil of Sambranna Highstar.
Sambranna undertook an extensive study of many of the great divine spellbooks of the Faerûnian pantheon, both cataloguing their spells and compiling their histories and known powers, as well writing of the nature of divine magic. Sambranna did this to inspire faith and prove the true might of the priests of the Realms, and covered all the major faiths equally to avoid weakening any one by sharing its secrets. The seer worked long and tirelessly, searched even in Myth Drannor, and presented queries even to the gods themselves. In this endeavor, Sambranna claimed to have the favor and protection of no less than three deities—Lathander, Mystra, and Oghma—and was confident of their protection should any there be any reprisals for the work.
Sambranna conducted research in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the , and wrote the preface to the work in a place called the Well of the Fallen there on Ches 12.
