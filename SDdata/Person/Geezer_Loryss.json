        "Description": "Geezer was an aging [[human]] man with graying hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Geezer ran a vegetable stall and was affected by the city's new draconian laws that confiscated most farm animals and produce entering the city in order to fight encroaching famine, according to the [[Flaming Fist]]s. At one point during that tumultuous year, Geezer managed to get a shipment of [[cabbage]]s into Baldur's Gate but the card ended up upturned, scattering the vegetables. The old man lamented his beloved vegetables' fate and his empty stall."
