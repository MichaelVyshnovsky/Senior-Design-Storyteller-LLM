A simple dagger was Mordakais weapon of choice. The sorcerer was a talented alchemist and diplomat, had knowledge of the Art, and preferred spells of the evocation school of magic.\nMordakai was born in Thay and was an apprentice under the Red Wizards until the day it was discovered that he had a natural gift for manipulating the Weaveâ€”he was a sorcerer. Mordakai did not share his old masters bloodthirsty nature and gladly abandoned the Red Wizards, fleeing north.\nIn the , Mordakai of Thay found himself in the northern city of Luskan, where he joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries, and Mordakai joined, hoping to set himself apart from the Red Wizards with his accomplishments."
