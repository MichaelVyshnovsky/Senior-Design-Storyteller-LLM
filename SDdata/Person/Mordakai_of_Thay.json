        "mainbody": "'''Mordakai of Thay''' was a [[sorcerer]], former member of the sinister [[Red Wizards of Thay]], and a member of an adventuring company called the [[Annals of Halgren]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Mordakai was not ashamed of his Thayan past, as was evident in his chosen name and red [[robe]]s. A simple [[dagger]] was Mordakai's weapon of choice. The sorcerer was a talented alchemist and diplomat, had knowledge of [[the Art]], and preferred spells of the [[evocation]] school of [[magic]].",
        "History": "Mordakai was born in Thay and was an apprentice under the Red Wizards until the day it was discovered that he had a natural gift for manipulating the [[Weave]]â€”he was a sorcerer. Mordakai did not share his old masters' bloodthirsty nature and gladly abandoned the Red Wizards, fleeing north.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, Mordakai of Thay found himself in the northern city of [[Luskan]], where he joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries, and Mordakai joined, hoping to set himself apart from the Red Wizards with his accomplishments."
