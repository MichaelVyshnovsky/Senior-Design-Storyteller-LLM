        "mainbody": "Praulgar was a Zhentarim wizard of the mid-14 century DR. He pretended to be a pot seller, Nargalarr, during his last mission.\nHe wore robes.\nAs Nargalarr, he acted as a somewhat dim-witted man. In truth, he was a petty tyrant, hated by his guards.\nHe had a spell-shield of sorts that could block a dagger, but would be exhausted after blocking one. One of his spells created lingering, deadly green flames.\nHe had four guards with him. None of them liked him very much.\nPraulgar joined Orthil Voldovans caravan heading from Scornubel to Waterdeep in late , shadowing Shandril Shessair, who was traveling in the same caravan he posed as a pot seller. During a chaotic ambush upon the caravan, he attempted to deceive Shandril into trusting him, but he was slain mid-sentence with two successive thrown daggers while trying to convince her he was out to protect her. His guards later struck his corpse with swords given the opportunity.\nPraulgars slayer was in turn slain by Narm, per Hlael Toraunt and Korthauvar Hammantle, who were scrying on the events as they unfolded."
