        "mainbody": "The '''Tree Slaker''' was an otherwise unnamed, malicious, [[druid]] who both viciously murdered [[humanoid]]s as well as served as protector of the [[Night Trees]] in [[Luruar]].",
        "Activities": "The ''Tree Slaker'' would ensnare, capture and bind [[humanoid]]s who ventured within the duo of forests known as the Night Trees. He would typically use [[Nature domain|nature]] [[spell]]s like ''[[wood shape]]'' and ''[[control plants]]'' to bind his victims to trees and slowly kill them via bloodletting. He was aided in these murders by a few select acolytes, typically other druids or fallen [[ranger]]s.\n\nBoth the malevolent druid, his disciples, as well as some of the more vicious plants of the Night Woods, such as the [[assassin vine]]s and [[shambling mound]]s, all guarded an ancient [[Temple of Chauntea (Night Trees)|temple of Chauntea]] that had been corrupted by some evil force."
