'''Ollyn Grimtongue''' was a [[shield dwarf|dwarven]] [[bard]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==History==
Some time before [[1374 DR]], he was named "Dirgekeeper" of the Citadel, by [[Emerus Warcrown|King Emerus Warcrown]]. With this unofficial title, Ollyn was solely entrusted with the duty of contributing new lines to the epic ballad The ''[[Dirge of Delzoun]]''. Over a century later he still held this position of authority and was working on a stanza to honor the memory of his recently departed king.
