Ollyn Grimtongue was a dwarven bard of Citadel Felbarr during the late 14 century DR. 
Some time before 1374 DR, he was named "Dirgekeeper" of the Citadel, by King Emerus Warcrown. With this unofficial title, Ollyn was solely entrusted with the duty of contributing new lines to the epic ballad The Dirge of Delzoun. Over a century later he still held this position of authority and was working on a stanza to honor the memory of his recently departed king.
