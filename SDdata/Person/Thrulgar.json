        "mainbody": "Thrulgar was a soldier in Eveningstar, Cormyr, during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was firm and ready to die for King Azoun IV and Lady Tessaril Winter.\nHe wielded a spear.\nHe served as a doorguard at Tessarils Tower, alongside Azatlim.\nIn the , Thrulgar was standing guard together with Azatlim when they were approached by Mirt, Shandril Shessair, and Narm Tamaraith, who were determined to get in. Before the situation turned violent because of Thrulgars insistence no one could pass without audience in the night, he recommended them to go to the Lonesome Tankard instead. Tzin Tzummer helped delay them, as did Mirt, who produced a Harper pin and a ring gifted by Azoun IV, but it wasnt until Tessaril ushered the three in that they were allowed to enter.\nLater, when Iliph Traun attacked the keep, Thrulgar led in a number of armed civilians, all of them ready to hold off the lich lord and die in the process, which they did. Thrulgar was amongst the casualties."
