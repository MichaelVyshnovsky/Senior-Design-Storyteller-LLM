Fadiya al-Farid was a holy slayer and member of the Grey Fire in 1367 DR.
Fadiya held grudges for years at a time, but she was pleasant to anyone from whom she required help.
Her parents were killed when she was very young, forcing her and her brother to take care of themselves on the streets of Hiyal. Fadiya was once a member of the Everlasting, until she was cast out.
