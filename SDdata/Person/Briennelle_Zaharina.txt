Briennelle Zaharina, or Brie-Zara, was the half-drow daughter of Drizzt DoUrden and Catti-brie in the late 15 century DR. 
Catti-brie gave birth to their daughter Briennelle Zaharina—named for both of her grandfathers, Bruenor Battlehammer and Zaknafein—during the war between all the houses of Menzoberranzan outside and beneath Gauntlgrym in the .
The child had auburn hair, like her mother, and her eye color was like her fathers, except a deeper, jewel-toned purple. Brie-Zaras skin tone was somewhere between her parents coloring, like a pink flower at dusk in hue.
