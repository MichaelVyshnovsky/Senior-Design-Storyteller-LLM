Brorn Roril was a retired swordcaptain of the Purple Dragons in Suzail, Cormyr, in the late 15 century DR.
He was fat.
He was louder and prouder than the rest of the regulars at his favourite tavern.
While retired, he became a regular at The Goose of Doom, a tavern.
After the massacre at the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the , Brorn Roril ran into The Goose of Doom to proclaim the Obarskyrs dead, and civil war as having begun. As the Obarskyrs were alive, he was mistaken in so doing.There is no reason given for this behavior on his part it can be assumed, however, that Manshoon, trying to create a civil war at the time, either misinformed or controlled him.
