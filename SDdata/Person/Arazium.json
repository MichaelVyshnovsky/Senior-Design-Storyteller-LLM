        "mainbody": "razium was a solar celestial from the world of Oerth and one of the opponents of the hero-turned death knight - Scaldulin.\nSages of Toril knew about some of Scaldulins feats and heroics on a distant world of Greyhawk, including the heros fall and transformation into a death knight. In the process of his fall from grace, Scaldulin slew Arazium using his enchanted sword that was especially effective against planar opponents. Eventually, the Hoarfrost Blade left the death knights hands and ended on on the world of Toril."
