Rilsa was a ranger who lived in and watched over a small stretch of the Cloud Peaks during the midâ€“14 century DR.
She was a rather trusting individual and preferred peace over actions of violence.
Among Rilsas possessions was a small ring given to her by Magreb. Its inscription read "With eternal devorion".
Rilsa and Magreb lived their days watching over their small stretch of the world. They were acquainted with a nearby wild mage hermit by the name of Adoy. While Magreb thought him dangerous, she believed him to just be rather odd.
In the , a tribe of goblins suddenly took up residence in a cave near Magreb and Rilsas cabin. When Rilsa went to investigate and speak with the goblins, she was killed by those under the rule of the hobgoblin king, Rogdok. Her remains were left within the cave.
