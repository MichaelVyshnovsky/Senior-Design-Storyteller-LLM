        "Description": "Marcus was an aging [[human]] man with a balding head of red hair. At the time of his death, Marcus wore a blue [[tunic]] and simple short pants.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''[[spelljammer]]'' ''[[squid ship]]'' crashed into the shores of the [[River Chionthar]]. Marcus along with several other poor souls, witnessed the crash and rushed towards the site, looking to help the survivors. He saw a beautiful black-haired [[elf|elven]] lass run from the crash, one of the survivors â€“ the woman named [[Shadowheart]]. Unfortunately, the elf was not the only one to survive. While Marcus was distracted by a beautiful woman, he was jumped and murdered by [[intellect devourer]]s who were onboard the magical vessel. The fisherman's body was left on the beach by the burning ''spelljammer''."
