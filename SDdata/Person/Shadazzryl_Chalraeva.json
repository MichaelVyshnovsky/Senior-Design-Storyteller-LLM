        "mainbody": "'''Shadazzryl Chalraeva''', often called '''\"Lady Harpy\"''', was a well-known actress at the famous [[Crown Aflame]] theater in [[Athkatla]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Shadazzryl was a beautiful woman with an ear-piercing strident voice.",
        "History": "The so-called \"Lady Harpy\" claimed to have come to [[Amn]] from [[Tharsult]] in the [[Shining Sea]] from a humble commoner family. However, many believed that in reality, she was a runaway noblewoman from a large city, possibly [[Waterdeep]], or somewhere in [[Tethyr]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Shadazzryl was one of the most famous actors who toured with the Crown Aflame theater, and her performances attracted crowds. Her most famous performance included stabbing herself in the chest several times with a real [[dagger]], performing one of the most realistic death scenes on stage. She survived each of these performances via the ''[[slowcreep heal]]'' [[spell]] that kept her alive until the play was over.\n\nOne more performance that made Shadazzryl Chalraeva famous was her portrayal of [[Sune]], the goddess of love and beauty. That performance was so prolific that once a [[priest]] of Sune in attendance became truly convinced that the Lady Firehair graced the theater with her manifestation. That particular performance was not graced by Sune's smile. However, on at least one occasion, The Princess of Passion manifested her giant face above the stage during Shadazzryl's performance. Lady Chalraeva was granted the ability by the goddess to float {{SI|1'|'\"|long=yes}} off the stage for the rest of the day. This gift came at a price. Sune took Shadazzryl's ability to speak for the duration of her floating, forcing the actress to sing her lines."
