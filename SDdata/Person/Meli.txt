'''Meli''' was a [[tiefling]] child from [[Elturel]] that was forced out of the city along with others of her kind following [[the Descent]] of late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Now, find yourself a maze and get lost. I'm busy.}}

==Description==
Meli had pale purple skin and two black horns that extended nearly straight upwards. He wore a simple leather vest, bound with  belt, and green pants.

==Personality==
Like several of the other tiefling children he was around, Meli was not above thievery and deceit. Unlike them however, he was more a sentimental child rather than an opportunist.

==Relationships==
While the exact circumstances unknown, Meli's spoke about his mother in a wistful manner. He sought out things that reminded him of her.

==Activities==
He was a member of the gang of tiefling children led by the aspiring criminal mastermind, [[Mol]].

==History==
Meli was among the community of tieflings that resettled in the [[Emerald Grove]] druid enclave after being kicked out from Elturel in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. While there, Meli stole a special [[brass]] [[locket]] from the adventurer [[Barth]], who had been hired along with others by the enclave's leader, [[archdruid]] [[Halsin]]. Barth confronted Meli about the amulet ― which had once belonged to his mother ― and chased Meli around the grove tring to get it back, much to the horror of other tieflings in the community.
