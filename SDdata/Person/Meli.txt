Meli was a tiefling child from Elturel that was forced out of the city along with others of her kind following the Descent of late 15 century DR.
Meli had pale purple skin and two black horns that extended nearly straight upwards. He wore a simple leather vest, bound with  belt, and green pants.
Like several of the other tiefling children he was around, Meli was not above thievery and deceit. Unlike them however, he was more a sentimental child rather than an opportunist.
While the exact circumstances unknown, Melis spoke about his mother in a wistful manner. He sought out things that reminded him of her.
He was a member of the gang of tiefling children led by the aspiring criminal mastermind, Mol.
Meli was among the community of tieflings that resettled in the Emerald Grove druid enclave after being kicked out from Elturel in the . While there, Meli stole a special brass locket from the adventurer Barth, who had been hired along with others by the enclaves leader, archdruid Halsin. Barth confronted Meli about the amulet ― which had once belonged to his mother ― and chased Meli around the grove tring to get it back, much to the horror of other tieflings in the community.
