        "mainbody": "'''Othlo''' was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the [[Copper Coronet]] in the [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] of [[Athkatla]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Othlo was a huge and muscular balding man. His ears were decorated with earrings and he worked wearing a [[breastplate]], [[greaves]], and armored [[codpiece]]. Judging by Othlo's physique, the bouncer was an experienced [[fighter]]. When at the Coronet, Othlo showed little but intimidating stoicism.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Othlo was an established member of the Copper Coronet's staff. He, along with [[Vaermaer]], [[Bordovan]], and [[Delric]], was supervised by [[Sarvo Droostan]], the Coronet's tavernmaster. Othlo worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. The bouncer and the rest of the huge men kept large rocks behind the bar. These rocks were used as projectiles, thrown around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Othlo's attitude changed to glacial when a city official or an obviously rich visitor entered the Coronet. He and his fellow bartenders did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronet's female employees."
