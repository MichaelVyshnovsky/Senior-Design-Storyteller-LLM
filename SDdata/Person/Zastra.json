        "mainbody": "astra was a ruthless gang leader imprisoned in Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR.\nZastra had dark skin and shoulder-length black hair. She wore a set of leather armor, and used her fists to fight instead of any weapon.\nZastra was fiercely (or perhaps desperately) defensive of what little she had in the prison, and refused to let any of it be lost.\nZastra was condemned to Wheloon Prison for regular criminal activities, not Sharran worship. She set about forming her own gang in the prison, and resisted both the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon and the Cormyrean forces that fought to take control of the prison."
