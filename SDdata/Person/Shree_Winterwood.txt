Shree Winterwood was an harpist, a musician of Saerb, considered to be the most prestigious musician of Sembia by some in the 15 century DR.
At the height of her fame, Shree was a very young half-elven woman with impressively huge eyes.
Shree Winterwood was famed for her music â€“ elegant, slow, and soft melodies strummed on her harp as she frolicked past huge Sembite trees.
