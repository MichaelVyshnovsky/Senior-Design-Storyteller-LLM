        "mainbody": "Commander '''Reyni Delapond''' was an [[Amnian]] [[Council Army]] officer who commanded [[Citadel Rashturl]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Reyni had an infectiously tenacious and positive attitude that made him quite popular with the other soldiers who gave him their trust and loyalty.",
        "Abilities": "Reyni was an exceptionally strong [[fighter]], very quick on his feet, and possessed of incredible charisma.",
        "History": "Reyni was a common soldier who worked his way up through the ranks. He won the command of Citadel Rashturl over the competition such as [[Arbas Rosznar]], but came to fame during the [[First Dragonspear War]] of [[1356 DR]] when he fought many [[baatezu]] and [[ogre]]s. His command of Citadel Rashturl was effective and well-executed, including a training regimen he devised that educated his troops in tactics, strategy, and history. Thanks to his leadership and administration, he made his garrison the most elite and well-trained group in Amn, and the posting in the isolated, spartan Citadel was considered a \"pearl\" that any soldier would be happy to get. His command continued through [[1370 DR]], maintaining the very high standards he had built."
