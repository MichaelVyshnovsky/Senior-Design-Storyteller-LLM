        "mainbody": "Commander Reyni Delapond was an Amnian Council Army officer who commanded Citadel Rashturl in the 14 century DR.\nReyni had an infectiously tenacious and positive attitude that made him quite popular with the other soldiers who gave him their trust and loyalty.\nReyni was an exceptionally strong fighter, very quick on his feet, and possessed of incredible charisma.\nReyni was a common soldier who worked his way up through the ranks. He won the command of Citadel Rashturl over the competition such as Arbas Rosznar, but came to fame during the First Dragonspear War of 1356 DR when he fought many baatezu and ogres. His command of Citadel Rashturl was effective and well-executed, including a training regimen he devised that educated his troops in tactics, strategy, and history. Thanks to his leadership and administration, he made his garrison the most elite and well-trained group in Amn, and the posting in the isolated, spartan Citadel was considered a \"pearl\" that any soldier would be happy to get. His command continued through 1370 DR, maintaining the very high standards he had built."
