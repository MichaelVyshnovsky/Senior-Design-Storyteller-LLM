Zora Ayre Affapanov was a girl in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.
Ayre was the daughter of Lord Serge Affapanov, a noble predicted to become one of the Blades allied with the Lords Alliance.
She spent most of her time with other noble scions Elred Korsinchev, Orym Illustriana, and Liticia Gos.
In 1491 DR, Ayre and some of her friends went missing. An adventuring party was hired to find them. She was at last found in the Yellow Breath Chapter House under Thylius Caramitrus influence.
