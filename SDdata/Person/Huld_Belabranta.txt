Huld Belabranta was a noble inhabiting Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He lived within Belabranta Villa located in the Sea Ward at the intersection of the Rough Road and Mendever Street.
Huld was a rarity among the wizards of Waterdeep in that he was one of a small handful of individuals who were not affiliated with the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors.
He was the patriarch of the Belabranta noble family of Waterdeep. Since some years prior his death, it was noted that his character had somewhat changed, from a cheerful and generous person to a darker, amoral and greedy wizard.
