Hamring was a Netherese arcanist that developed several mind-related spells.
Hamring was an extremely unwise mage, and was not particularly charismatic either. He had several strong beliefs, both personal and work-related. His beliefs included nature taking its true course, particularly in terms of life and death. He believed all Netherese should adhere to his beliefs about the natural order.
The mentalist was born in Specie in . He grew up tending to a field whilst beginning his studies in magic. The talented mind-mage developed several spells over a period of only three years, each of them affecting others in a negative way. Hamring was not only an inventor of spells, but a writer of books. He wrote three books about naturalism throughout his life. Refusing to extend his life by the use of magic, he suffered a fatal heart attack in .
Apart from the numerous spells he created, his legacy also lived on via three simulacrums. These simulacrums continued Hamrings work and even wrote a couple more books about naturalism, though they certainly werent as gifted as Hamring himself. These books detailing the natural order were not well received, due to the artificial nature of their authors.
