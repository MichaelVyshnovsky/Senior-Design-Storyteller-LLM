'''Ruggedo''' was the [[deep gnome]] king of [[Deepearth]] in the [[Underdark]] in the [[Barony of Bloodstone]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Ruggedo ruled Deepearth until the [[duergar]] led by the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]] seized the city. He lived with his people in exile until 1357 DR when he planned with [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s party on how to regain the city.

After regaining his city, Ruggedo swore eternal friendship to Gareth. Later he joined the council that ruled the Barony.

In [[1359 DR]], the gnomes had regained control of the city and worked with the [[dwarves]] of the [[Orothiar Clan]] in order to exploit [[bloodstone]] mines. Ruggedo was pondering to join the [[Alliance of Belt Watchers]].
