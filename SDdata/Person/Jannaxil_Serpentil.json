Most people considered him nasty or unfriendly, but he knew how to be charming if the situation demanded it, and acted obsequiously in the presence of nobility.\nHe never confronted anyone trying to steal from him directly&mdashas magics prevented them from leaving the shop, he would simply wait until they paid or set down their spoils.\nThe old man had running disputes with several scholars of the city. They took the form of insults and slander, malicious gifts and offending letters, and even hiring bards to spread discrediting songs in the towns taverns.\nFinally, Jannaxil loved good books. He was known to pay a hefty sum for nicely illuminated tomes, old maps, or collections of well-illustrated female figures.\nJannaxil was known to dabble in the Art, but the extent of his powers were unclear.

He also dealt in the sale of animals and slaves.\nRegularly buying account papers and letters from malicious or careless customers, Jannaxil used them to blackmail his fellow Waterdeep residents.\nDuring the , Jannaxil was attacked by Elaith Craulnober, leaving him with an intense hatred for elves.\nAccording to tavern talks, Jannaxil built hidden tunnels where he hid caches of powerful magic protected by monsters, including copies of every useful spells found in the books he sold over the years."
