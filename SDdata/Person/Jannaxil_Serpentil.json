        "mainbody": "'''Jannaxil Serpentil''' was a shopkeeper inhabiting [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''[[Spellbook]]s give off green flames when they burn.''|\nJannaxil Serpentil}}",
        "Description": "Jannaxil was a short and plumpish man, whose black hairs were oiled and smoothed into place. He wore a sober scholar robe, open over finely tailored dark clothes, in an attempt to show that he was both a successful merchant and a learned person. \n\nHe was one of Waterdeep's best fences.",
        "Personality": "Jannaxil was as greedy and cowardly man who drove a hard bargain. Most people considered him nasty or unfriendly, but he knew how to be charming if the situation demanded it, and acted obsequiously in the presence of nobility.\n\nHe never confronted anyone trying to steal from him directly&mdash;as magics prevented them from leaving the shop, he would simply wait until they paid or set down their spoils.\n\nThe old man had running disputes with several scholars of the city. They took the form of insults and slander, malicious gifts and offending letters, and even hiring [[bard]]s to spread discrediting songs in the town's [[:Category:Taverns|taverns]].\n\nFinally, Jannaxil loved good books. He was known to pay a hefty sum for nicely illuminated tomes, old maps, or collections of well-illustrated [[:category:females|female]] figures.",
        "Abilities": "Jannaxil was known to dabble in [[the Art]], but the extent of his powers were unclear. Some pretended that he lived for far longer than his looks led one to believe, while others said he was able to summon [[baatezu]] and had various [[monster]]s do his bidding.\n\nJannaxil and his shop were protected by hundreds of magical [[spell]]s, from [[glyph of warding|glyphs]] attacking would-be thieves to magical alarms warning him if someone entered uninvited or tried to leave without paying for his wares.",
        "Possessions": "Jannaxil owned more books than most people would ever see in their life. He used various [[glowing globe]]s to illuminate the interior of his boutique.\n\nJannaxil possessed a black, slim book which [[Volothamp Geddarm]] believed to be a [[tome guardian]].",
        "Activities": "Jannaxil owned [[Serpentil Books & Folios]], a book shop located in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] on the eastern side of [[Book Street]] just south of [[Black Wagon Alley]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Volo 5303}} For a steep fee, Jannaxil would perform book searches for customers trying to locate rare publications.\n\nIn addition to running his shop, Jannaxil was also a fence for stolen maps, [[scroll]]s, charts, and books. He also dealt in the sale of animals and slaves.\n\nRegularly buying account papers and letters from malicious or careless customers, Jannaxil used them to blackmail his fellow Waterdeep residents.",
        "History": "During the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Jannaxil was attacked by [[Elaith Craulnober]], leaving him with an intense hatred for [[elves]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": {
            "Secret tunnels": "According to tavern talks, Jannaxil built hidden tunnels where he hid caches of powerful magic protected by monsters, including copies of every useful spells found in the books he sold over the years."
