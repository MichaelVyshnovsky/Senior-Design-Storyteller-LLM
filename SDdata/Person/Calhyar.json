        "mainbody": "Calhyar, or Calhyar of the Winds, was the third senior Witches of Rashemen in Mulsantir and a senior member of the Moonstars in 1370 DR.\nKhelben himself did not understand the motivations of Calhyar but preferred to have her close in order to unveil her secret. \nCalhyar was the first to offer her services to Khelben Arunsun, saying to had have a premonition about four years before. Khelben accepted her only because he himself knew little about Rashemen and hoped to collect more information from Calhyar."
