        "mainbody": "Cork Renford was a human fighter and adventurer of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHe had a wanderlust and a desire for excitement, and he was on the lookout for adventure.\nCork aimed to join a promising adventuring party or find employment as a bodyguard for a traveler. Hence, he was often found in taverns and inns while looking for work or a hook. He would undertake any mission or adventure that promised him excitement.\nAmong Corks adventuring gear, he wore a helm, a leather breastplate, and an enchanted +1 chain mail, and wielded a shortsword of quickness."
