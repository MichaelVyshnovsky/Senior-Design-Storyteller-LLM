Ki Mor Sha was the mayor of the town of Tai He on Akari in the Prioto Islands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Ki Mor Sha was the brother-in-law of Ko Lei Kho, the governor of Akari.
Although Mayor Ki ordered the townsfolk to avoid the Ochimo spirit warriors that terrorized the island around , he had them maintain big bonfires and keep watch around the plateau by night. While the townsfolk feared the Ochimo and complained about Governor Kos handling of the matter, they felt Mayor Ki was doing the best he could. Ki put the priests at the local temple to the Path of Enlightenment to work on the spirit problem, but host a celebration for any adventurers who happened to defeat one. However, this would draw the ire of the remaining spirits to his home.
