==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gereth was a regular shopper at the [[Adventurer Mart]] in Athkatla's grand [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. He searched for [[salamander dust]] while being wary of the notorious [[Cowled Wizards]]. If anyone asked, Gereth claimed to need the substance of soup. The wizard refused to ask the proprietor â€“ [[Ribald Barterman]] for help with salamander dust as they were not on speaking terms after Gereth's claim that the shopkeep overcharged him for a bottle of [[pitch]] and a bundle of [[mice]] tails.
