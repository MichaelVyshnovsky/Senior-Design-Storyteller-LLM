'''Eudhis Bhamm''' was a [[human]] male herbalist and the proprietor of [[Bhamm's Herbs]] in [[Eshpurta]], [[Amn]], in the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]] He had a surly disposition and was quick on the rejoinder. He was usually nervous and with good reason: he was a [[wizard]] in a land that had nearly outlawed wizardry. With much persuasion, he could be convinced to allow potential customers into his "compounding room" where he had an almost complete stock of spell components for every occasion&mdash;at double the usual price.
