'''Nall''' was a veteran mercenary from the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Nall was a tall and muscular dark-skinned man adorned in a suit of [[chainmail]]. His scalp was clean-shaven, and his skin bore weather and scars from his long mercenary career.

==History==
When the city of [[Neverwinter]] survived two short but draining military conflicts in the {{YearlinkName|1372}} and the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the city's [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter|Graycloak]] troops suffered lack of finances, equipment and lack of trainers for its new recruits. A heroic adventurer named [[Khelgar Ironfist]] was assigned stewardship of the [[Crossroad Keep]]. Desperate for instructors, Khelgar attempted to recruit Nall and his small band of mercenaries when they spent some time at the kelp's only inn â€“ the [[Phoenix Tail Inn]]. Nall turned the [[dwarf]] down and began getting annoyed by the local militiamen trying to change his mind and train them in war and survival. Nall stated that training militia would never ensure a worthy legacy. A band of heroes, who settled within the Keep alongside merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]], were asked to convince Nall to change his mind; however, the task was accomplished by his female mercenary companion who suggested they all needed a break from constant fighting and maybe Khelgar Ironfist would be able to teach them something in return.
