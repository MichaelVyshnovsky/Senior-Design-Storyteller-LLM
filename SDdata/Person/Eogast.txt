'''Eogast''' was the chief of the [[wikipedia:Droving|drover]]s leading the animals in [[adventuress]] [[Zaranda Star]]'s merchant caravan as she traveled from [[Morninggold Keep]] to [[Zazesspur]] in [[Mirtul]] of [[1366 DR]].
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
Like many dwarves, Eogast was bearded. He was at least 200 years old when he served Zaranda Star.

==Personality==
When angered, Eogast had been known to stomp his feet, pull out the hair in his beard, and curse vehemently.

==History==
When the party reached a farm that had been raided by bandits, Zaranda ordered her drover-in-chief to pull the animals off the road to protect them and the merchandise, while she and the other adventurers approached the burning farmhouse.

When the party arrived at the walls of Zazesspur, Eogast was angered that Zaranda paused the caravan before entering the city through one of the breaches in the wall, but she convinced him that they would have to pay less in bribes that way, and this satisfied him.
