Bock was the Guildmaster of the Purple Masks Guild , a thieves guild located in Iriaebor in the midâ€“14 century DR.
He was an enormous man with several chins, dressed in maroon and silver silk, with a pudgy ring-covered hand.
Despite his appearance, he was an intelligent man.
By the early 1360s, Bock had been asking Jewel, the head of an independent thief family, to marry him for at least twenty years she kept saying maybe.
In 1363 DR, he helped the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon get information about Ravendas, and he also helped them get into the dungeons of the High Tower of Iriaebor to try and free prisoners that Ravendas was holding captive.
