        "mainbody": "Anders was a carpenter, caravans hand, and an assistant to merchant Madoc of the Shield Trading Company in the late-14 century DR.\nIn the , Madoc and Anders took their caravan from the Dalelands to the city of Voonlar. Weary of vengeance of Madocs previous employer - the Black Network, and the recent fiend raids along the roads of the Moonsea, the merchant spared no expense in hiring a well-known hero from the city of Daggerford for 10,000 gold pieces.\nJust within reach of Voonlar, the caravan wagon lost its wheel, causing Madoc to go into a rage. Thankfully, Anders repair was swift, and the caravan reached the city soon after. However, the halflings fix was not as sturdy as everyone thought, and the wagon completely fell apart as the caravan entered the city, barely reaching the Shield Trading Company. Predicting the dwarfs anger, Anders scampered away before being held responsible for the disastrous end of the journey."
