Watchful Skull '''Tynnos Argrim''' was the founder of the [[Flames of the Dark Sun]] and the head priest of the [[Cyricist]] [[Mountain of Skulls]] temple in [[Amn]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=LoI.A-p27">

==Personality==
He was a wholly vicious man that held little to no loyalty for others, even within the greater [[church of Cyric]].<ref name=LoI.A-p27" />

==Relationships==
Argrim held a particular hatred for Blackwill [[Haarken Akhmelere]] of the [[Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse]].<ref name=LoI.A-p59"> Each of them claimed that their temple was the greatest in all of southwestern [[Faer√ªn]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Tynnos Argrim secured an invitation for himself to a rival temple of Cyric, the [[Dark Redoubt]] under pretense of discussing the Cyricist faith. After entering within, he slew the temple's head priest and brought its clergy under his own influence.<ref name=LoI.A-p27" /> He then installed Dark Master [[K'rvan]] as the new high priest of the Dark Redoubt to ensure his control over his newly-aquired congregation.<ref name=LoI.A-p53">

When the [[Sothillisian War]] broke out in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, he allied his forces with Amn against the [[Sothillisisan Empire]].
