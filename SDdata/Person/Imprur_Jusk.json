        "mainbody": "Imprur Jusk was a rich halfling investor and landlord from Suzail, active before the late 14 century DR.\nBefore the late 14 century DR, Imprur owned the warehouse where Flar Oldbottles Nets, Ropes, Cables, Hawsers, and Cords was located on the eastern side of the canal that connected the Basin with the Dragonmere in Suzail. One day Imprur discovered a hidden gate that activated only in the darkness between Flar Oldbottles Nets and the Red Sunsets Trading Company warehouse to the south. The gate became known as Jusks Stroll, which he used to quickly move between Suzails docks and an alley behind the Dragons Jaws inn. The gate was in nightly use by the halfling to commute to the posh drinking establishments on the Promenade. Imprurs proclivities were so infamous there was a saying in Suzail that one could know where Jusk spent the night because the smell of harbor fish clung to the highcoin girls he fraternized with.\nThe halfling remained in control of Jusks Stroll until his death of winter fever sometime before the late 14 century DR."
