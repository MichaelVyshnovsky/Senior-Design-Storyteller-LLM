Prince Nari ibn Aman was a member of the royal family of Kadarasto in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Nari was an intense individual who had quick temper. Despite this he was far more popular among Kadarastos poor population when compared to his father.
Prince Nari commanded Kadarastos armed forces. He was viewed as a local hero for striking down tomb-robbers, eliminating Dihlizs sanctioned thieves, and striving to punish all who plundered the ruins near Kadarasto.
Nari was a young member of the royal family and son of Khedive Aman al-Qasi abu Nari. The Devout were his personal bodyguards.
