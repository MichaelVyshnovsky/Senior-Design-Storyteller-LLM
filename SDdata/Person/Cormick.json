            "Gameplay": "Cormick was last seen in front of [[Aldanon]]'s house after being injured by thieves in a botched burglary. Depending on the Kalach-Cha's actions, Cormick either died from his injuries or survived the ordeal. If the Kalach-Cha refused to negotiate with the thieves, Cormick died as the thieves tried to make a run for it. If the Kalach-Cha decided to negotiate and was successful, then Cormick was taken to the [[Temple of Tyr]] to heal. After a few days, the Kalach-Cha heard that Cormick had gotten up and decided to go out and get some fresh air while he was on leave recovering from his injuries."
