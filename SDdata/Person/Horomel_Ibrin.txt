Horomel Ibrin was a sly negotiator inhabiting Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He was a thin man who always had a disapproving look to his face unless excited by money or wielding his influence.
Horomel held the office of "Scribe and Speaker of the Merchants." He served as a link between Tulmons sultan and the merchant class with all matters related to trade.
He was enemies with Orloro Tullamas and spent much of his time investigating the merchant with the hopes of catching him breaking the sultans law.
