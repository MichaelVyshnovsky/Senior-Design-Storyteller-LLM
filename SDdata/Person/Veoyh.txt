Veoyh was a beholder inhabiting Veldorn during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Though he was certainly in a position to attempt to wrest power from Saed, an ancient vampire who ruled Veldorn at this time, he respected his rivals power enough to give the matter careful thought.
Veoyh had a twin named Xaoch.
