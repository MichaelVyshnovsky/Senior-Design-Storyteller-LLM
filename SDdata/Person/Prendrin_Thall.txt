'''Prendrin Thall''' was an [[elf]] [[rogue]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who died while on an expedition in the [[Shining Sea]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|21}} sometime around the month of [[Flamerule]], a group of eccentric entertainers, entrepreneurs, and scientists embarked upon a colonizing expedition to an island they discovered in the Shining Sea off the coast of [[Chult]], which they dubbed the "[[Forgotten Island]]". Led by a charismatic [[Waukeenar]] [[priest]] named [[Devlin (Ravens Bluff)|Devlin]], they sought to create a tourist attraction on the isle that would attract people from all across the Realms.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2,4}} Three months later, things began to go awry for the expedition.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|2}}

On the [[Marpenoth 1|First of Marpenoth]], a tree fell down upon an outbuilding of the [[Devlin's camp|campsite]], destroying a magical [[mirror]] that the group's [[mage]] [[Briella Farthing]] that been using to maintain contact with the outside world.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|20-21}} Not long after, Prendrin expressed to Devlin his thoughts that foul play had been involved with the tree, rather than it just being a freak occurrence. By [[Marpenoth 9]], potential investor Prince [[Faruq]] had still not arrived as expected and Prendrin expressed to Devlin that [[Baerwald]], a [[druid]] that had been trying to convince them to abandon their plans, was likely responsible.

On [[Marpenoth 11]], five [[velociraptor]]s infected with [[olive slime]]s attacked the camp's messhall. The group managed to slay them all, but not without the [[fighter]] [[Argus]] dying and the fighter [[Mallus]] becoming injured.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|22}}

Over the course of the next three days, Prendrin Thall and the rest of the group became infected with olive slimes due to close proximity with Mallus, who had contracted an infection from the velociraptors.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|7}} On the night of the third day, [[Marpenoth 19]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Land Remembered|8}} Finding bits of olive slime on all of their bodies, Devlin worked to scrape the [[ooze]] off them. He burned the scrapings in a wicker basket and then proceeded to burn the bodies of everyone inside the barracks. Before hanging himself the next day, Prendrin Thall's name and the names of the rest of the expedition crew would be recorded by Devlin in the last entry of his diary.

Two days later, [[Marpenoth 22]], a group of [[adventurer]]s arrived to the island in search of Briella Farthing and investigated the ruined campsite. Outside the barracks they discovered the unburnt corpse of Prendrin Thall. Examining his back they found signs of Devlin's scraping, as the elf's spine he was covered with scrapes and scars, as though someone had tried to peel his skin away with a [[dagger]] or small [[knife]]. The adventurers then cast ''[[speak with dead]]'' on Prendrin's body, allowing him to identify all the corpses within the barracks. He also expressed a certainty that it was their leader Devlin who had murdered him, as Mallus had warned everyone that the priest had gone insane, though would also admit that Mallus had become quite strange in appearance, not fully aware that his ally had become a [[slime creature]].
