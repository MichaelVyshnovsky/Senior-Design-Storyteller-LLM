'''Krimsal''' was a Lord of [[Cormyr]] and a serial killer of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Open Feast]] at [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Mirtul 26]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, Krimsal was discussed by [[Jhalikoe]], and an envoy from [[Milvarune]]. Jhalikoe insisted that Krimsal, while responsible for much murder and mutilation, was no worse than other nobles, just more open about it. At the time of that conversation, Lord Krimsal was in hiding, after his murders the previous winter.

==Rumors & Legends==
His exploits were known as far as [[Milvarune]].
