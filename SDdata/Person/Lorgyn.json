There, they discovered that the Great Foe of the malaugrym, Elminster, had been killed during the second battle of Shadowdale. So instead Bralatar and Lorgyn went to Sembia to collect magic from the wizards of that land. There they killed the wizard Mortoth and ran into their fellow malaugrym Lunquar, who was busy killing local Zhentarim. They decided to check Elminsters tower, hoping to find the secrets of Malaug.\nBack at the Tower of Mortoth, however, Bralatar was killed in a sudden attack by Irendue Nuen-tar, the most promising apprentice of Mortoth. Lorgyn took Irendue captive. He then decided to collect mages and went to Tilverton to find new members for his collection."
