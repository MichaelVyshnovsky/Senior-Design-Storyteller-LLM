According to the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' and the ''[[Neverwinter Campaign Setting]]'', the 4th-edition campaign starts in [[1479 DR]], meaning that Arshryke disappeared in 1477 DR. he went missing in [[Sembia]] while on duty, and many presumed that he was discovered and killed by the Sembian counterespionage force. In [[1479 DR]], a cache that contained, among many things, notebooks penned by Arshryke, was found in the roof of the palace in [[Lyrabar]]."
