'''Hubert Windcastle''' was an aide to Lord Protector [[Dagult Neverember]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Hubert sent messages to trusted [[human]] [[adventurer]]s in the city to seek their help on matters benefiting Neverwintan citizens. He first requested they meet Scout [[Stone (person)|Stone]] in [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] and later the historian [[Retrigal Bookbinder]] in [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath|Neverdeath]] graveyard, and finally [[Ril Ironlance]] at the [[Neverwinter/Chasm|Chasm]].

However, Hubert was forced to get involved in person after he possibly insulted one of Neverember's guests at dinner, he faced being sacked unless he could complete a vital task, and he could not find a capable go-between. Thus, he ventured to the [[Whispering Caverns]] of the [[Underdark]], hired the same adventurer, and had them rescue the [[Elmheart]] family from a [[drow]] villa where they were enslaved. Afterward, while the adventurer held the drow off, Hubert led the Elmhearts to freedom. Presumably he would retain his job after that.
