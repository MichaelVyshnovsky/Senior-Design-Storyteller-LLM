'''Keefe''' was a priest of [[Kelemvor]] in [[Phlan]] during the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==History==
Keefe was a young priest of Kelemvor who with his fellows guarded the [[Valhingen Graveyard]] in the city. Secretly, he was also an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]].

He came to believe that one of the dead, [[Xandria Welltran]], was in truth a ''[[polymorph]]ed'' [[green dragon]] and hired some adventurers to help him unveil the mystery.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|17}} The result was that Xandria was indeed a dead dragon and someone had tried to resurrect her as a [[dracolich]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|20}}
