'''Sondal''' was the duel arena owner and organizer in the [[Ust Natha tavern]] around [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Sondal hosted a duel arena in the central tavern of Ust Natha. He believed that dueling animals was pitiable, and that only a drow versus drow match was fair. Among his duelists were [[Lasaonar]] and [[Chalinthra]].
