'''Artagalor Goldbeard''' was an [[dwarf]] jeweler and shopkeeper inhabiting the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the lateâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As his name implied, Artagalor's beard was brilliant gold.

==Activities==
He owned [[the Eye of the Beholder]], a jewelry shop located in the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on [[Twilight Street]]. He was a dextrous and skilled craftsman who worked with [[jewel]]s and precious metals.

Artagalor stayed in [[Zhentil Keep]] following the city's destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}} because his god, [[Moradin]], commanded it of him. Moradin appeared to him saying "this city needs a few shining lights amongst the filth."
