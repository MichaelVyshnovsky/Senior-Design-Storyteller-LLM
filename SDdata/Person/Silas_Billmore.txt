==History==
At some point before the late 14{{th}} century DR, Silas came across a [[Thay]]vian slave, Tyvia Velent. Silas purchased her and gifted her freedom, and subsequently, the two became lovers. Tyvia accompanied Silas on his business trips, including when dealing in spices with the [[Merchant House]] of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Silas Billmore, his lover, and his bodyguard, were guests of the [[Golden Goblet Inn]] in Mossbridges but showed little interest in conversing with the locals nor traveling adventurers.
