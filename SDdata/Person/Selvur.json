        "mainbody": "'''Selvur''' was a [[doppelganger]] who, while posing as a [[Calishite]] merchant, lived in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the 1200's DR, Selvur purchased a great many decrepit buildings in a city block in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep]] that was bounded by the [[Beaconmarch]] and [[Malkur's Ride]]. He gradually tore these buildings down and had them replaced with taller ones, leaving enough room in-between to form [[Selvur Alley|an alleyway]] between the two roads, which would later be named after him.\n\nThe ruling body of Waterdeep were so pleased with his work that they offered him tax breaks on all the construction. But unbenknownst to them, Selvur was gradually building and housing a community of doppelgangers within his city block."
