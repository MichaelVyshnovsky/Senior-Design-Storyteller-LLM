        "mainbody": "Selvur was a doppelganger who, while posing as a Calishite merchant, lived in the city of Waterdeep in the 13 century DR.\nIn the 1200s DR, Selvur purchased a great many decrepit buildings in a city block in the North Ward of Waterdeep that was bounded by the Beaconmarch and Malkurs Ride. He gradually tore these buildings down and had them replaced with taller ones, leaving enough room in-between to form an alleyway between the two roads, which would later be named after him.\nThe ruling body of Waterdeep were so pleased with his work that they offered him tax breaks on all the construction. But unbenknownst to them, Selvur was gradually building and housing a community of doppelgangers within his city block."
