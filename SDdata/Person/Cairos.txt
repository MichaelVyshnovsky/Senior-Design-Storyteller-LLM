'''Funglesby''' was a [[fighter]]-thug and an Envoy of [[Stone Lord]], who opposed the [[The Guild]] crime gang of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Funglesby had a crimson skin tone of a [[tiefling]] with the taint of [[Asmodeus]] running through his veins. He had shortly-cropped brown hair and black horns. Funglesby worse a set of [[heavy armor]] and was armed with an [[enchanted]] [[hammer]] â€“ ''[[Corpsegrinder]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], [[Farlin]] led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by Cairos, who served as Stone Lord's envoy. In his foul attitude and arrogance, Funglesby would not believe that [[Minsc]] of [[Rashemen]] was Stone Lord even if he confronted the tiefling directly. The groups clashed under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]] over a shipment of supplies. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and either of squads's fate remained uncertain.
