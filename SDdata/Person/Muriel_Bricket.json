        "mainbody": "'''Muriel Bricket''' was a frivolous and money-grabbing noblewoman from [[Daggerford]], sister to [[Alicine Bricket|Alicine]] and [[Elveronne Bricket]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''You have some nerve to speak to me this way! Elveronne was the most horrid, penny-pinching, domineering, wretch to ever bear the name of \"Bricket,\" and we're all relieved he's finally gone. I would ask that you leave our house before you upset us further.''|Muriel Bricket}}",
        "Description": "Muriel was a plump and mature human noblewoman with pale skin and white hair.",
        "Personality": "Muriel appeared as a welcoming and pleasant woman who valued etiquette.",
        "History": "Muriel Bricket openly feuded with their brother over his strict money management and tight control of the Bricket family estate. He considered her nothing but a frivolous embarrassment to the family name. Elveronne's resentment culminated in him trying to write the sisters out of his will. However, in [[1372 DR]], Muriel hatched a plot to [[poison]] the old man and take over the family fortune without Alicine's knowledge. She doused Elveronne's [[fish]] dinner in a fast-acting deadly poison, and the sisters watched the old man choke and die.\n\nDuring the funeral, Alicine, in secret from everyone, stole her brother's precious  [[enchanted]] ''[[elven keepsake necklace]]'', the act that was to haunt the sisters soon after.\n\nSoon after Elveronne's timely demise, Muriel and Alicine organized a party to celebrate the old man's departure from the land of the living. They invited several of their friends, including [[Sancha]], Alicine's pen pal from [[Bowshot]]. During the celebration, the sisters served refreshments and expensive ''hors d'oeuvres'', such as magically rejuvenating [[elvish seedcake]]s. All partygoers shared disdain of Muriel's brother, calling him cruel and abhorrent.\n\nDuring the celebration, Elveronne Bricket, unbeknownst to his sisters, rose from the family's crypt and made way to the family's house in the [[Western Farmlands]]. The corpse's disappearance prompted the individual later known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to investigate the occurrence. This led the Hero and their companions to the odd celebration. [[Raegen Brunegar]] noted that a lavish party was strange, especially so soon after Elveronne's interring. By her own admission, Muriel was happy, almost giddy at the prospect of living out her life outside of old man Bricket's shadow.\n\nOnce sisters realized the Hero of Daggerford investigated the death of their \"beloved\" brother, both excused themselves from the party and headed to the second floor of the manor, attempting to hide any evidence there might be of the murder. Feverishly trying to hide any evidence, Muriel tossed a vial of potent poison out of the window but not before the Hero was able to witness her suspicious act. She lied about cleaning some broken branches of the windowsill. However, it was fairly obvious she lied as the thud from the dropped object did not sound like dead twigs.\n\nThe Hero discovered Elveronne Bricket in his undead form, burning with palpable hatred and murder lust, shuffling around the manor's basement. Ignoring the creature's revenant form, the Hero communicated with Elveronne and discovered that the undead wanted revenge or his keepsake returned. However, it was unknown if the Hero poured the ''[[holy water]]'' on Elveronne, destroying him, negotiated the return of the enchanted ''elven keepsake necklace'', or allowed old man Bricket to exact his murderous revenge. One thing was clear - in the end, Elveronne Bricket was returned to eternal rest, one way or another."
