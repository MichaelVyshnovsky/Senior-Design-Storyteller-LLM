'''Raevilin Strathi''' was an [[elven]] [[conjurer]] who was became mad, during his stay in a strange device of [[the Underdark]].

==Possessions==
He fought with a [[quarterstaff]], and carried [[scroll]]s which could summon [[earth elemental]]s and [[efreeti]]. Raevilin also had in his possession the enchanted [[bastard sword]], ''[[Albruin]]''. 

==History==
Raevilin Strathi and his group set out to the Underdark to explore, made no enemies and found nothing of importance.

Prior to [[1369 DR]], Raevilin became trapped in the second-from-left facet of the [[Facet sphere]]. During his entrapment, he appeared to have lost his senses, particularly speech. He may have been rescued by the adventuring part of [[Gorion's Ward]], if treated with powerful [[divine]] magic. He admitted that he had lost his mind in the "nothingness" of the sphere, and became trapped by unknown means.
