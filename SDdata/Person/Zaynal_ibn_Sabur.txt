}}'''Zaynal ibn Sabur''' was one of [[Grand Caliph]] [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]]'s wives in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Zaynal was a dark and passionate beauty and one of Khalil's favorite wives. She moved with the sultry, predatory grace of a hunting cat.

==Personality==
Zaynal had a fiery temper that mellowed a bit over the years to the point where she tolerated Khalil's younger wives and concubines.

==Abilities==
Trained in [[Kadarasto]], she was a legendary dancer of the highest proficiency.

==History== 
During her first decade in the Royal Harim, Zaynal's rivals were known to disappear for days at a time. Upon their return, these shaken rivals always deferred to Zaynal with respect.

Only two people knew Zaynal's true identity&mdash;the [[Alyana al-Azzazi|Grand Vizier]] and Khalil's maternal aunt, [[Rahmah al-Zahir|Sitt Rahmah]]. Zaynal was in fact a [[holy slayer]] of the [[Soft Whisper]], sworn to protect the Grand Caliph. Zaynal had 50 slaves at the Royal Harim, all of whom were female holy slayers as well.
