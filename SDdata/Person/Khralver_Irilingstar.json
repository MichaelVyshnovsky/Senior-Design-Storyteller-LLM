        "Description": "Khralver was a [[human]] man with pale skin and long brown hair.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the city of [[Luskan]] attempted to take over the town of [[Port Llast]], enrolling the aid of [[the Prioress]], a powerful cleric of [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen. After she completed her part of the deal, the Luskanites backed out of the deal, causing the Prioress' wrath, trapping Luskan's ships in Port Llast. Khralver Irilingstar was sent to negotiate with the scorned woman, but he met his doom in the Drowning chamber of the [[Priory of the Depths]], where the priestess performed her Umberlant rituals."
