Nora and Dora were the cook twins of Thistleflame Manor and servants of Lord Partic Thistle circa 1369 DR.
Nora and Dora were dutiful enough in their work, but they did have a tendency to gossip too much.
The twins were excellent cooks, and handled most of the Manors meals. They worked alongside Malda, who they wisely prevented from getting involved in anything except boiling.
Like Malda, they found Doms histrionic baking style rather tiresome to work around.
