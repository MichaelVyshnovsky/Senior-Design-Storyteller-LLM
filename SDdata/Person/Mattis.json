        "mainbody": "'''Mattis''' was a young entrepreneur who was among the [[tiefling]]s exiled from the city of [[Elturel]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was described as a 'collector of valuable objects', which were in fact mostly useless.\n\n{{Quote|Hold our your hand, mister. Let me show you something.|Mattis, to a customer before they are pickpocketed.}}",
        "Description": "Mattis had short gray-brown hair cut just above shoulder length. He dressed in a simple leather vest, blue trousers, and wore a notable amulet around his neck.",
        "Personality": "He had a knack for attracting and catching the attention of prospective customers. He used a combination of flattery and sleight of hand to keep people engaged and interested in viewing his wares.",
        "Activities": "Mattis was one of the numerous tiefling children who worked for the aspiring criminal mastermind [[Mol]]. Mattis' role in the gang was that of a friendly face to passersby. He sold all manner of items and trinkets, of varying degrees of usefulness, from food and tools to books and fantastical jewelry that purportedly granted significant powers.",
        "Possessions": "Mattis shop included numerous mundane items that could be of some use to others, including some food, a [[shovel]], a set of [[thieves' tools]], kitchen utensils, and even a [[starfish]]. More interesting however were the \"magic\" pieces of jewelry he had for sale. Notable among these were the ''ring of being really invisible'', a ''ring of the lekinesus'', attached to which was a small bit of fishing line tied to a rock, a ''ring of resistance to ants'', which was adorned with a drop of sap containing several dead [[ant]]s, and the ''ring of infinite wishes'', which was inscribed with completely nonsensical [[rune]]s.\n\nHe also offered for sale a copy of ''[[Tarbell's Guide to Distractions]]'' and a single ''[[arrow of Ilmater]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, every tiefling in Elturel was exiled from the city, following the catastrophic event in which the city was [[the Descent|pulled down to the Nine Hells]] for a short time. Mattis and other children were among the refugees that followed the [[Hellrider]] officer [[Zevlor]], en route to the great city of [[Baldur's Gate]] to the west.\n\nIt was during that journey that Mattis and other tiefling children began to work with Mol, the aspiring future criminal overlord of Baldur's Gate. When the tiefling refugees settled om the [[Emerald Grove]] for a time, Mol, Mattis, and others formed a little hideaway in a secluded area of the grove."
