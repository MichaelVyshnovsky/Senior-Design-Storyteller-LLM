        "mainbody": "Ravia () was a member of the Cult of the Eternal Fire in the Moonsea.\nRavia was a cruel and pernicious individual, and believed that she couldnt be stopped. She delighted in cruelly taunting others for their wasted efforts.\nIn 1491 DR, Ravia was ordered by her master to deliver a \"devastations orb\" to the cults chapter in Mulmaster. However, during a stop in Elmwood, the orb spontaneously detonated, razing the village. The only survivor was Ravia, who was kept in custody first by Mulmasters City Watch and then by Zora Rosealine Culkin, owner of the village."
