High Radiance Ghentilara was the head of the temple of the Lathander, known as the Spires of the Morning, in Waterdeep around 1372 DR. 
By 1372 DR Ghentilara still maintained her smooth, olive-hued complexion, but her long, braided hair had turned white with age. She was as equally at home serving peasants as she was attending more formal events with other dignitaries.
She was uncomfortable with some of the preachings of the monk, Hanor Kichavo, of the Order of the Sun Soul, though she never publicly aired her opinions of him or his teachings.
