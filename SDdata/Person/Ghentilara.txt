'''High Radiance Ghentilara''' was the head of the temple of the [[Lathander]], known as the [[Spires of the Morning]], in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1372 DR]]. 

==Appearance and Personality==
By [[1372 DR]] Ghentilara still maintained her smooth, olive-hued complexion, but her long, braided hair had turned white with age. She was as equally at home serving peasants as she was attending more formal events with other dignitaries.

==Relationships==
She was uncomfortable with some of the preachings of the monk, [[Hanor Kichavo]], of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]], though she never publicly aired her opinions of him or his teachings.
