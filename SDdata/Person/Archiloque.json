        "mainbody": "Archiloque was a gnome warrior and wizard inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nArchiloque was small even for a gnome.\nThough he practiced magic, arthritis in his hands prevented him from casting all but the most basic spells.\nHe lived in a house in the south section of Daggerford located on Kaoth Alley near the barracks.\nArchiloque was close friends with the skilled weaponsmith Ransaran. Ransaran crafted a special set of short swords for Archiloque that included a series of straps and safety catches, allowing him to effectively wield the weapons with his arthritic hands."
