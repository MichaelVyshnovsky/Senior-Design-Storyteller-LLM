        "mainbody": "Elf\nLarrel was a baelnorn and former elven archmage of great power. He was the founder Severed Hand fortress in Icewind Dale, that remained there for hundreds of years leading up to the 13 century DR.\nIn his undead state, Larrel was entirely blind.\nHe was an exceptionally prideful individual who could not be reasoned with when made up his mind about a situation.\nLarrel was a powerful archmage that developed his own spells and tapped into magics inaccessible to others. He crafted a unique spell to project his own image beyond his physical form, and was one of the few beings that could access the powerful scrying powers of the Heartstone Gem.\nLarrel had one known daughter Evayne. She was loving and loyal elf of the Hand but believe her father irrational at times.\nIn the 10 century DR, Larrel led his community of sun elves north to the lands of Icewind Dale. It was there that they founded the fortress known as the Hand of the Seldarine.\nWhen a great host of orcs and goblins amassed in the North, Larrel led the elves of the Hand into an alliance with the dwarves of Dorns Deep. Together the two peoples forged new artifacts of tremendous power, ones marked by the beauty of elven craftsmanship and power of dwarven artisans. This alliance served both peoples well for decades, until a rift appeared between them. Humans appeared before the alliance requesting to purchase some of their newly-crafted artifacts the dwarves were amenable to trading with the humans, while Larrel and the elves were not. Despite their disagreement, the dwarves agreed to continue as they had and not open up trade.\nAs the allied forces engaged goblin and orc horde, Larrel and his fellow elves were aghast to witness them using those elven-dwarven weapons. Believing the dwarves had broken their agreement, Larrel became entirely irrational, and refused to discuss the situation with dwarven leaders. The distrust that formed between the once-allied people became too much to bear and the alliance was broken.\nThe elves of the Hand attempted to hold back the horde of Icewind Dale without their dwarven allies but were ultimately unsuccessful. Larrels daughter Evayne traveled to Dorns Deep to plead with the dwarves to re-forge their alliance, but became trapped within the fortress as the horde overwhelmed it. She died during the invasion of Dorns Deep.\nWhen the monstrous horde overran the Hand of the Seldarine, Larrel and his fellow mages attempted to raise a mythal over the imperiled elven fortress. The ritual did not go as planned however. Larrel and the others inadvertently cursed everyone inside the Hand—elves and invaders alike—with the eternal undeath. For his hubris, Larrel was cursed by the god Labelas Enoreth as a baelnorn. He was afflicted with a form of madness that left him babbling incoherently, incapable of communicating with others.\nYears later, in the , a group of adventurers from Easthaven ventured into the Severed Hand and worked with Gelarith to repair and rebuild the room-sized astrolabe within the Labelas Tower. Witnessing that great feat restored Larrels sanity. Larrel agreed to help the adventurers with their quest to investigate the evils that loomed over Icewind Dale. He used the Heartstone Gem to see that their path led next to Dorns Deep itself and directed them to its location in the Spine of the World.\nLarrel was not sure why he remained within the ruins of the Severed Hand―as it was then called―but supposed he could put to rest the spirits of the elves within and help shepherd them to their afterlife on Arvandor."
