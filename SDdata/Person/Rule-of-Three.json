        "Description": "Rule-of-Three was just about the most knowledgeable source on the [[Abyss]] available. He dwelt on [[Azzagrat]] in the city of [[Zelatar]] or in [[Sigil]]. He was allied with Graz'zt, and knew much about the Abyssal Realms. When in Azzagrat, he stayed in the back room of an inn called the [[Golden Opportunity]]. People searching for information from him could easily access it, but for a three-pronged price, such as precious metals of three different types or three magic items.\n\nRule-of-Three was the mastermind behind the plan for which he was named, a uniting of tanar'ri, yugoloth, and baatezu to take over the upper planes."
