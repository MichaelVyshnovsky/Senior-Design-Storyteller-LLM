        "mainbody": "Female\nFelrekt Lafeen () was one of the top agents of the Bregan Daerthe in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.\nFelrekt, together with Soluun Xibrindas and Krebbyg Masqilyr, was tasked by Jarlaxle with doing dirty deeds in the city. Felrekt resided at the Scarlet Marpenoth ship, where he cleaned his firearm.\nFelrekt was born female but at some point changed to being male. However, disgusted with the treatment of males in drow society, he joined Bregan Daerthe. Almost immediately, Jarlaxle was impressed with Felrekt, who volunteered for all the most dangerous missions.\nIn 1492 DR, if Jarlaxle managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, then Felrekt and Krebbyg confronted some adventurers first in Mistshore, where they had the support of the Lantanese mechanical dragon turtle Big Belchy, and again in the Dock Ward.\nFelrekt lacked the typical drow cruelty and killed opponents only if he had no other options. He was the most loyal lieutenant of Jarlaxle.\nFelrekt and Krebbyg were a working team.\nLike his fellow Soluun Xibrindas and Krebbyg Masqilyr, Felrekt was equipped with Lantanese firearms."
