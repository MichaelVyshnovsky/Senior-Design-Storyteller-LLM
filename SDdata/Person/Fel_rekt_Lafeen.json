        "mainbody": "'''Fel'rekt Lafeen''' ({{Pronounce|FEL|rekt|_|lah|FEEN|refs=}}) was one of the top agents of the [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in [[Waterdeep]] during the early 1490s [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Fel'rekt, together with [[Soluun Xibrindas]] and [[Krebbyg Masq'il'yr]], was tasked by [[Jarlaxle]] with doing dirty deeds in the city. Fel'rekt resided at the ''[[Scarlet Marpenoth]]'' ship, where he cleaned his firearm.",
        "History": "Fel'rekt was born female but at some point changed to being male. However, disgusted with the treatment of males in [[drow]] society, he joined [[Bregan D'aerthe]]. Almost immediately, Jarlaxle was impressed with Fel'rekt, who volunteered for all the most dangerous missions.\n\nIn [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} if Jarlaxle managed to obtain the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', then Fel'rekt and Krebbyg confronted some adventurers first in [[Mistshore]], where they had the support of the [[Lantanese]] mechanical [[dragon turtle]] [[Big Belchy]], and again in the [[Dock Ward]].",
        "Personality": "Fel'rekt lacked the typical drow cruelty and killed opponents only if he had no other options. He was the most loyal lieutenant of Jarlaxle.",
        "Relationship": "Fel'rekt and Krebbyg were a working team.",
        "Possessions": "Like his fellow Soluun Xibrindas and Krebbyg Masq'il'yr, Fel'rekt was equipped with Lantanese [[firearm]]s."
