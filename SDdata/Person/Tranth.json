        "mainbody": "The fifth Baron of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]], known only by his family name '''Tranth''', was the ruler of [[Bloodstone Pass]] and de facto mayor of [[Bloodstone Village]] in the early and mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Tranth stood at 5 feet, 11 inches tall (180 cm). While strong in his youth, he had put on weight by the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, weighing around {{SI|200|pounds|k|long=yes}}. His hair had greyed by this time.\n\nIn battle, he preferred to fight heavily armored in [[plate mail]]. In melee, he preferred his [[enchanted]] [[shield]] and [[longsword]], and at range, he used a mundane [[heavy crossbow]].",
        "Personality": "Tranth was magnanimous and dedicated to the welfare of his people. He could be curt in conversation, but exuded competence and nobility.",
        "Relationships": "Tranth was a member of [[House Tranth]], the hereditary rulers of Bloodstone Valley. He had a daughter, [[Christine Dragonsbane|Christine]]. He was a direct descendent of the first King of Damara, [[Feldrin Bloodfeathers]], and was thus related to King [[Virdin Bloodfeathers]].",
        "History": "Tranth was born in autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1297}},Tranth goes from age 60 to age 61 in the time between ''[[Bloodstone Pass (adventure)|H1: Bloodstone Pass]]'' and ''[[The Mines of Bloodstone|H2: The Mines of Bloodstone]]'', adventures which occurred during the end of autumn and start of winter in the year prior to the state of Damara as described in ''[[The Bloodstone Lands (sourcebook)|The Bloodstone Lands]]'' sourcebook, which was subsequently placed in [[1359 DR]] in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]''. and inherited the barony from his father in the {{YearlinkName|1333}}, not long before trouble in [[Vaasa]] began to reduce the appeal of Bloodstone Pass as a trade route.\n\nTranth led his people through the horrors of both the [[Wolf Winter]] of [[1347 DR]] and the decade-long [[Vaasan War|invasion of Damara]] by [[Zhengyi|Zhengyi the Witch-King]] beginning the following year. During these periods, this barony's wealth evaporated with first the loss of trade and the subsequent loss of [[Bloodstone Mines]], their primary source of mineral wealth. Following Damara's capitulation to Zhengyi in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Tranth was the only ruler of any Damaran barony or duchy not to be killed and replaced by a lackey of the Witch-King, although he effectively wielded no political power outside of Bloodstone Village itself.\n\nAfter the fall of Damara, the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] built the local bandits into a powerful army, and Tranth agreed to pay tributes to the bandit army in order to spare the villagers' lives. However, when the bandits also took away as slaves some youths from the village, Tranth decided he needed to fight back. Thus, in [[1358 DR]], he sent [[Garlen]] and [[Garvin]] in search of some adventurers to help them.\n\nAfter [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s party destroyed the bandit army, Tranth acquiesced to the request by his daughter, Christine, to marry Gareth. Tranth then stepped down, making Gareth the sixth Baron of Bloodstone. and [[Castle Perilous]]. He was present at the decisive battle at the [[Ford of Goliad]].\n\nFollowing the end of the Bloodstone Wars in [[1359 DR]], Tranth proposed the creation of a [[Bloodstone Lands|Bloodstone Kingdom]], comprising both [[Vaasa]] and [[Damara]]."
