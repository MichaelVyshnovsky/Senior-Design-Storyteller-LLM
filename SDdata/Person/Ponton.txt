'''Ponton''' was a cleric of [[Tyr]] in [[Urml]] in the [[Shining Plains]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
Ponton took care of the temple of Tyr in Urml, where was kept the [[Hand of Tyr]] [[artifact]] gauntlet.

==History==
Ponton started his training in the [[Church of Tyr]] in Urml under [[Devron]], an old cleric who had fought during the famed [[Battle of Urml]] of [[1258 DR]]. So he became enthusiastic about the anniversary in 1358 DR, but disliked that the event had become a kind of reenactment and local festival instead of a celebration of Tyr.

During the [[goblin]] attack on the reenactment, the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]], posing as the White Warrior, arrived and asked for the Hand of Tyr from Ponton, who happily gave to him.
