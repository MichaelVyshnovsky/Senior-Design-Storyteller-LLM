'''Angajuk''' ({{Pronounce|AWN|gah|jook|refs=}}) was a talking [[sperm whale]] that had the ability to speak [[Common]].

==Description==
This whale had a boat strapped to his upper back and head with a large leather harness. The boat was was able to fit several [[humanoids]] in. When the sperm whale planned to go underwater, he was able to create an air bubble, so that the passengers were able to breathe in such an environment. He had multiple scars across his body sustained from attacks by [[Auril]]'s [[roc]], [[Iskra]].
