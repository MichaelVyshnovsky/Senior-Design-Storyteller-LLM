By the Tooth, you have done what we could not â€“ fed the dust to old [[Gulrithi]], and toppled the Skull!''|Gloran}}",
        "History": "At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Gulrithi, an ancient [[dark naga]] necromancer created a lair within the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The dark naga hated [[Mystra]], the goddess of magic, and attempted to defile the Shrine of the Silver Fire which was maintained by Gloran and [[Ethe]], two [[guardian naga]] priestesses of the Lady of Mystery. Gulrithi lured the [[cleric]]s into a magical trap. The two nagas remained in stasis until a group of [[adventurer]]s known as the [[Veiled Ones]] slew Gulrithi and his [[mohrg]]s and master [[wight]]s. The heroes broke the ''head pole'' that maintained the stasis trap, releasing the Sisters. Gloran returned to the Shrine and reignited its divine Silver Fire, continuing to guard it against the invading force of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
