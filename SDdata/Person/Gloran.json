The dark naga hated Mystra, the goddess of magic, and attempted to defile the Shrine of the Silver Fire which was maintained by Gloran and Ethe, two guardian naga priestesses of the Lady of Mystery. Gulrithi lured the clerics into a magical trap. The two nagas remained in stasis until a group of adventurers known as the Veiled Ones slew Gulrithi and his mohrgs and master wights. The heroes broke the head pole that maintained the stasis trap, releasing the Sisters. Gloran returned to the Shrine and reignited its divine Silver Fire, continuing to guard it against the invading force of the Cult of the Dragon."
