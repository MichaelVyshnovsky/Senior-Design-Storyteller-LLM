'''Behring''' was an unusual [[dwarf]] [[wizard]] in [[Daggerford]] around [[1370 DR]].

[[Alustriel]] of [[Silverymoon]] believed he had [[human]] blood despite Behring denying this hypothesis. He liked the open spaces of the wilderness and did not love the underground locales typical of his fellows.

His home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}
