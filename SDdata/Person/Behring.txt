Behring was an unusual dwarf wizard in Daggerford around 1370 DR.
Alustriel of Silverymoon believed he had human blood despite Behring denying this hypothesis. He liked the open spaces of the wilderness and did not love the underground locales typical of his fellows.
His home was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along Wall Street.
