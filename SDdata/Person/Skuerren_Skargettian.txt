'''Skuerren Skargettian''' was a [[duergar]] tavern owner in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Skuerren managed the [[Thrown Gauntlet]], a tavern known for offering violent spectacles of armed and unarmed combat at least once a tenday. Skuerren paid gangs to "recruit" combatants in the streets, but volunteers were welcome. A hulking [[troll]]kin bouncer named [[Stonebreaker]] kept control of the situation.
