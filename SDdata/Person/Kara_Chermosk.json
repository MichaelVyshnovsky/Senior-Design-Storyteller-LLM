        "mainbody": "'''Kara Chermosk''' was the commander for the [[Zhentarim]] forces of the [[Tethyamar Fortress]], nestled in the western [[Dalelands]] amid the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].",
        "Personality": "Kara earned much respect from her soldiers for her iron-handed rule and severe manner, which brooked no dissent. Her time among the caravans of the [[Black Road]] gave her a great skill in negotiation, allowing her to form alliances with creatures that would normally shun her kind.",
        "Possessions": "For her exceptional service, Kara Chermosk was granted a [[Banesword]] from the vaults of [[Zhentil Keep]] by [[Scyllua Darkhope]].",
        "Relationships": "Commander Chermosk harbored a secret lover in the form of her second-in-command, Captain [[Sergoi Meristaak]]. Sergoi adored Kara and stayed by her side at all times in battle.",
        "History": "Raised by Zhentarim merchants in Zhentil Keep, Kara Chermosk grew up under the yoke of the Black Network's rule. In time, she decided to become a soldier among the Zhentarim and spent many years working as a caravan guard, making her way back and forth across the [[Black Road]] of the [[Anauroch]]. Kara briefly took the time out of her career to join the [[Church of Bane]] as a [[cleric]] before rising up through the ranks to become a commander.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], Kara had been promoted to the position of base commander in the [[Tethyamar Fortress]] where she forged an alliance with the [[Fiend|fiendish]] denizens they found there.",
