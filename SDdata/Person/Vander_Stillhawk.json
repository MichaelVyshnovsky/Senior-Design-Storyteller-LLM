        "mainbody": "Vander Stillhawk was a human ranger of Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was a companion to Queen Zaranda Star before her ascension to the crown.Heroes Lorebook calls Vander a wood elf, but all other sources make it clear he was human.\nVander was tall, slender, and long-limbed, with hard muscles under dark and weathered skin. He could be considered handsome, if one liked the tall, dark, and brooding sort. Vander could not speak, as  but rather communicated through elven hand signals.\nWhen Vander was a boy, orcish raiders cut out his tongue, leaving him mute.\nHe was raised by the elves of the Elven Woods. The elves not only trained him in use of the bow, but also in elven hand signals, allowing him to communicate with others.\nHe became a companion of Zaranda Star during the Reclamation Wars of Tethyr.\nIn the battle for Zazesspur in the , Vander was slain. Yet Shield of Innocence, an orog paladin of Torm, beseeched his god to restore Vander to life, before he sacrificed himself.\nAfterward, Vander attained high position in the court of Tethyr, which grants him many titles Monarchs Champion, Regent of Prince Coram Rhindaun, and leader of the Warriors of the Star. The former title placed him in charge of the monarchs safety as the Warriors were the personal guard of Queen Zaranda Star and King Haedrak III. He was also one of the Queens Councilors. Prince Coram even received his name, Vander.\nHe carried a magical elven +1 longbow, as well as a longsword and a clip-bladed hunting knife.\nAs well as being able to use any kind of bow, Vander possessed an innate magical power to repair a damaged arrow simply by running his lips along the shaft.\nLike most rangers, Stillhawk despised entering a city, preferring to remain in nature. His expression was almost always grim."
