'''Amethyst Trueblood''' was a [[gnome]] priestess active in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Amethyst Trueblood disliked and mistrusted all [[elves]] after an elven thief once lifted her coin purse, armor, weapons, and even her [[holy symbol]], leaving her defenseless in face of danger. Nevertheless Amethyst continued praying for the trickster elves' salvation.

==Possessions==
Amethyst never went anywhere without her [[war pony]] named [[Stardancer]]. She usually was armed with [[throwing axe|throwing axes]], a magical +2 [[shortsword]], a magical +3 [[shield]], and of course, her [[holy symbol]].
