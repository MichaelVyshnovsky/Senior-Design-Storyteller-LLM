She had a more calm and almost understanding demeanor, which stood in stark contrast to the other [[goblin]] cultists.

==History==
Cry was present at [[Dror Ragzlin]]'s [[ritual]], when the [[hobgoblin]] warlord. attempted to [[Speak with dead|interrogate]] a dead [[mind flayer]] brought back to the Shattered Sanctum in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The aberrant creature was aboard a [[nautiloid]] ship that crashed near the [[River Chionthar]], a vessel that carried an item of great importance to the Absolute.
