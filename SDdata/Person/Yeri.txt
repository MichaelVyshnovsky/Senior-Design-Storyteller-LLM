'''Yeri''' was a member of the [[Sand Kings]] rebel group in [[Anauroch]] in [[1479 DR]].
 
==History==
Yeri was a veteran of innumerable desert campaigns.

In 1479 DR, the Sand Kings discovered that the shadovar were on the verge of gaining control of the [[Spiral Gate]], a crucial [[portal nexus]]. So they tried to sabotage the shadovar's efforts. Yeri was in this task force.

==Personality==
Yeri was a fatalistic individual, seeing all fights as potentially being her last one. She fought with a frenzy that saved her more than one time, but put her allies always in danger.
