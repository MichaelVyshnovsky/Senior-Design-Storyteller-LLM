Yeri was a member of the Sand Kings rebel group in Anauroch in 1479 DR.
Yeri was a veteran of innumerable desert campaigns.
In 1479 DR, the Sand Kings discovered that the shadovar were on the verge of gaining control of the Spiral Gate, a crucial portal nexus. So they tried to sabotage the shadovars efforts. Yeri was in this task force.
Yeri was a fatalistic individual, seeing all fights as potentially being her last one. She fought with a frenzy that saved her more than one time, but put her allies always in danger.
