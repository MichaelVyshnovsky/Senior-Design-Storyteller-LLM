        "mainbody": "Hopper was one of six horses kept by a group of travelers that lived in the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe older horse had cracked a hoof some time before he and his humans, the mage Druhallen, Galimer, Rozta, and Tiep, arrived at Parnast in the . That year, he and five other horses, including Bandy, Cardinal, Ebony, Fowler, and Star, accompanied the party, until the young lad was forced to simply lead the old horse.\nDuring the journey Hoppers injured hoof got worse, and it became apparent he would not endure the full trip through the mountains and back again. Understanding that Hopper would die regardless the circumstances, Druhallen and the others decided to sacrifice the gelding to appease a tribe of Dekanter goblins and help ensure safe passage through the mines. Druhallen conjured fire within Hoppers brain to ensure a quick death, and let the goblins feast on his remains."
