'''Drakar''' was a [[human]] man. He served as a cook to both the [[Red Brigade]] mercenaries and later the [[Vipers]] [[bandit]]s.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}

==History==
Drakar was once the personal cook to Captain [[Cedric Ravajar]] of the Red Brigade during the 1360s [[DR]]. When Cedric disbanded the group in the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Drakar followed him, and joined the new Vipers bandits. He cooked for them at the [[Vipers' Nest]].

==Description==
Drakar was 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 250 pounds (113 kilograms). In his younger days, he had a muscular and athletic build, but he let himself go, fattening as he became a gourmand. He had black eyes, long, blond hair that was unclean and unkempt, and a scruffy beard as he went weeks between shaving.
