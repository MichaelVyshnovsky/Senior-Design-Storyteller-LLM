Drakar was a human man. He served as a cook to both the Red Brigade mercenaries and later the Vipers bandits.
Drakar was once the personal cook to Captain Cedric Ravajar of the Red Brigade during the 1360s DR. When Cedric disbanded the group in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Drakar followed him, and joined the new Vipers bandits. He cooked for them at the Vipers Nest.
Drakar was 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 250 pounds (113 kilograms). In his younger days, he had a muscular and athletic build, but he let himself go, fattening as he became a gourmand. He had black eyes, long, blond hair that was unclean and unkempt, and a scruffy beard as he went weeks between shaving.
