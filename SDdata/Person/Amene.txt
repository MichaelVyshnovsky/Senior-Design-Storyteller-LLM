Amene was a kahin and member of the House of Hotek tribe in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Amene served as Sheikh Ibrins vizier. She convinced him of the erroneous ways of his past when he traded with Hiyal, convincing him of the need to destroy the city. She was always at the sheiks side offering advice and comfort.
Many whispered that Amene would one day become Ibrins wife. Ibrins first wife died shortly after Amene became part of the tribe.
