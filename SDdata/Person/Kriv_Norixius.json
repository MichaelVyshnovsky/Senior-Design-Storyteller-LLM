        "mainbody": "riv Norixius was one of the ten members that served on the Absolution Council, the ruling body of the Revels End prison and the group that oversaw the fates of the prisons inmates on behalf of the Lords Alliance during the late 15 century DR. He represented his home town of Daggerford.\nWhile good at heart, Councilor Norixius held no compassion in his heart for anyone that broke the law.\nHe wore a crimson suit and an extra-wide pince-nez.\nAlong with his fellow councilors, Kriv helped decide the fates of the criminals imprisoned within Revels End. He strove to carry out his duties to the best of his abilities, in the hopes of impressing Duchess Morwen Daggerford.\nDue to his uncompromising views on law and order, he never once voted to commune a prisoners sentence.\nthumb|right|250px|Kriv listens to Edgins case.\nIn the late 1490s DR, the Absolution Council—Kriv Norixius, Voss Anderton, Jil Torbo, and a delayed Jarnathan—met in Revels End to consider a pardon for Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Norixius was impatient and suspicious with Edgins many breaks and stalling whilst making his statement. He was right to be—ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.\nMore than a year later, the same council met to consider Forge Fitzwilliam for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him."
