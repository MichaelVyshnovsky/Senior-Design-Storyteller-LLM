He represented his home town of [[Daggerford]].",
        "Personality": "While good at heart, Councilor Norixius held no compassion in his heart for anyone that broke the law.",
        "Description": "He wore a crimson suit and an extra-wide [[Wikipedia:pince-nez|pince-nez]].<ref>",
        "Activities": "Along with his fellow councilors, Kriv helped decide the fates of the criminals imprisoned within Revel's End. He strove to carry out his duties to the best of his abilities, in the hopes of impressing Duchess [[Morwen Daggerford]].\n\nDue to his uncompromising views on law and order, he never once voted to commune a prisoner's sentence.",
        "History": "[[File:Heroes Unite - Absolution Council.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Kriv listens to Edgin's case.'']]\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the Absolution Council—Kriv Norixius, [[Voss Anderton]], [[Jil Torbo]], and a delayed [[Jarnathan]]—met in Revel's End to consider a pardon for [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. Norixius was impatient and suspicious with Edgin's many breaks and stalling whilst making his statement.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} He was right to be—ultimately, though, the Council approved their pardon, the pair escaped by fighting off the guards, grabbing Jarnathan, and jumping through the window before they could announce it.\n\nMore than a year later, the same council met to consider [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him."
