'''Hekkut the Molted''' was a [[wererat]] [[hobgoblin]] [[wizard]] and bandit of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a lieutenant and brood-servant of [[the Hark]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/"Extermination" Plot Recap}}

==History==
In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Hark sent Hekkut and his goblins through the [[Flayers' Corridors]] to establish an outpost near the road halfway between [[Loudwater]] and [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]].

For a month, they attacked the [[strongheart halfling]]s using the road, ultimately killing all the sons of the [[halfling]] merchant [[Blaz Merrymar]], and taking a [[silver]]ed [[short sword]] belonging to one of them along with much mundane goods. They sacrificed their victims to [[Maglubiyet]] and dumped their remains in a pit: the halflings, a few [[human]]s, and a pair of [[orc]]s were found, along with the carcasses of [[deer]] and other animals they'd hunted. When an [[ogre]] discovered their cave, they killed it too, but not before losing a dozen goblins. Their loss prompted Hekkut to intend to ask the Hark for goblin reinforcements when next he reported back and delivered his "tribute" of stolen goods.

But late one afternoon in [[Eleasias]], Skar, Gvrag, and other goblins caught Blaz himself and tortured him, before a newly formed band of [[adventurer]]s happened upon the scene and rescued him. Blaz entreated them to hunt down the goblins and avenge his slain sons.While the ''Extermination'' module has Hekkut attempt to escape, either before or during the final battle with PCs, it leaves it open as to whether he gets the chance, escapes successfully, or is slain. However, the official recap makes it clear that he is alerted and escapes. Regardless, Hekkut never appears again in [[Legacy of the Green Regent]], even in ''[[Dungeon of the Hark (LGR)|Dungeon of the Hark]]''.

==Relationships==
Hekkut was accompanied by a [[rat]] [[familiar]] named Zuunt. A lieutenant of the Hark, he commanded a score of [[goblin]] bandits, including [[Skar]] and the [[bugbear]] [[Gvrag]]. They respected him but were terrified of his [[lycanthropy]], fearing that contracting it would bar them from their afterlives, so they were unwilling to betray him or the Hark. They had a pair of tame [[lightning rat]]s as guards. The goblinoids had [[tattoo]]s and [[weapon]]s bearing rat designs marking them as followers of the Hark.<ref>

==Personality==
[[File:Hekkut's strange script.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''The rats in the walls: inspecting Hekkut's writings.'']] 
Hekkut was completely paranoid, going so far as to trap and alarm his own lair and escape route within the bandits' base. He was quite cunning, but also cowardly. He also had a mental illness giving him both an attention deficiency and compulsive behavior. A product of this was inventing his own pictographic code for the [[Goblin language]] and inscribing notes about his journey and mission on the walls of his cave; his writing style oscillated from crude to elegant.

He venerated an unnamed rodent [[deity]] via an idol-turned-[[brazier]] in his lair.This deity is unidentified, but one possibility in the wererat god Squerrik detailed in ''[[Monster Mythology]]''.

==Possessions==
He had a [[spellbook]] containing several minor [[spell]]s, up to ''[[sleep]]'' and ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', as well as a ''[[scroll]] of [[color spray]]'' and a [[spell component pouch]]. He wielded a [[quarterstaff]] and wore moth-eaten [[robe]]s.
