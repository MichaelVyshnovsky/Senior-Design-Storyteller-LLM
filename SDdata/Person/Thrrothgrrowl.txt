Thrrothgrrowl was the son of the wemic Tenpaw tribe King Grrothgrrowl, the most powerful king of the Shining Plains as of the late 14 century DR.
King Grrothgrrowl fathered a son in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The birth happened shortly before the visit of Adamar Session, Bard of Starmantle, during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Vilhon Reach. The bard attended the annual remembrance vigil held at the Hill of Memories in the Shining Plains and witnessed several individuals, including a female member of the Emerald Enclave congratulating Grrothgrrowl with Thrrothgrrowls birth. Adamar mused about the wemic prince in his guide to Vilhon Reach and speculated that at the time of writing, Thrrothgrrowl was likely an adult.
