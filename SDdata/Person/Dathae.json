        "mainbody": "'''Dathae''' was a [[swanmay]] [[ranger]] of [[Mielikki]] from [[Essembra]] in [[Battledale]] in the 12{{th}} and 13{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. She was a noted bearer of the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"RC\">Though not explicitly stated, it may be inferred that Dathae was a ranger and a follower of Mielikki. First, swanmays are typically rangers. Second, the 'Rightful Cycle' of ownership of ''Yornar's Trail Companion'' is to pass from ranger to priest and priest to ranger among the faithful of Mielikki. Since Dathae carried it from priest to priest, she is likely a ranger. However, it is unclear if this is considered before or at the resumption of the Rightful Cycle.",
        "Relations": "Dathae was the wife of the [[ranger]] [[Rhighaermon O'Antlers]]. He was a nobleman of [[Waterdeep]] who'd renounced his title and was the bearer of ''Yornar's Trail Companion''.",
        "History": "Dathae married Rhighaermon in the {{YearlinkName|1196}}. Notably, they hung the glowing, crescent-moon-shaped ''Companion'' over their bridal bed. Afterward, while on their honeymoon, Rhighaermon finally delivered the ''Companion'' to the priest [[Klavaeron]] of [[Cedarsproke]] in the [[Gulthmere Forest]]. During this journey, Dathae's double-life as a swanmay was revealed, and they stayed together all their life.\n\nMany years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1246}}, Rhighaermon's path crossed that of the ''Companion'' again, when a [[mind flayer]] unwittingly tried to trade it to him in a bazaar in [[Murghyr]] in [[Murgh√¥m]]. Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the ''Companion'', then carried it to the closest [[temple of Mielikki (Maerlar)|temple of Mielikki]], in [[Maerlar]] in [[Mulhorand]], though he suffered mortal injuries from the mind flayer's [[doppelganger]] minions. [[Mielikki]] herself slew the doppelgangers and carried the dying Rhighaermon to her realm. It was left to Dathae to complete the ''Companion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s journey, carrying it from Maerlar to the next Mielikkian priest in the book's 'Rightful Cycle'."
