        "mainbody": "Dathae was a swanmay ranger of Mielikki from Essembra in Battledale in the 12 and 13 centuries DR. She was a noted bearer of the holy Mielikkian spellbook known as Yornars Trail Companion.Though not explicitly stated, it may be inferred that Dathae was a ranger and a follower of Mielikki. First, swanmays are typically rangers. Second, the Rightful Cycle of ownership of Yornars Trail Companion is to pass from ranger to priest and priest to ranger among the faithful of Mielikki. Since Dathae carried it from priest to priest, she is likely a ranger. However, it is unclear if this is considered before or at the resumption of the Rightful Cycle.\nDathae was the wife of the ranger Rhighaermon OAntlers. He was a nobleman of Waterdeep whod renounced his title and was the bearer of Yornars Trail Companion.\nDathae married Rhighaermon in the . Notably, they hung the glowing, crescent-moon-shaped Companion over their bridal bed. Afterward, while on their honeymoon, Rhighaermon finally delivered the Companion to the priest Klavaeron of Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest. During this journey, Dathaes double-life as a swanmay was revealed, and they stayed together all their life.\nMany years later, in the , Rhighaermons path crossed that of the Companion again, when a mind flayer unwittingly tried to trade it to him in a bazaar in Murghyr in Murgh√¥m. Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the Companion, then carried it to the closest temple of Mielikki, in Maerlar in Mulhorand, though he suffered mortal injuries from the mind flayers doppelganger minions. Mielikki herself slew the doppelgangers and carried the dying Rhighaermon to her realm. It was left to Dathae to complete the Companions journey, carrying it from Maerlar to the next Mielikkian priest in the books Rightful Cycle."
