Turhan al-Ruffik was a Zakharan mamluk inhabiting Qudra in Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Turhan was originally from a desert tribe until kidnapped and sold into the army of Qudra. Over time he accepted his new role in life and became quite zealous in his duties. Ashamed of his past, he was particularly hard on desert dwellers when an opportunity presented itself.
He wore enchanted chain mail and wielded a scimitar of speed.
