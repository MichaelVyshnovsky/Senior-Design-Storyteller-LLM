'''Droki''' was a [[derro]] criminal in [[Gracklstugh]] during the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
Droki hated everyone in general and surfacers in particular. If he met surfacers, he spent all his time insulting and misleading them. If someone took his satchel, Droki would throw an epic tantrum. He was also obsessed with doing things exactly where and when they should be done, believing that not respecting this arrangement would alter his destiny.

==History==
Droki was a notorious criminal courier transporting goods for many gangs and cabals in Gracklstugh. During the [[demon]]ic crisis that struck the Underdark in the late 1480s DR, he had commissions for the [[Gray Ghosts]] thieves guild and for a secret cult of [[demon]]-worshiping derro. For this, he was wanted by [[Errde Blackskull]] and [[Gartokkar Xundorn]].
