        "mainbody": "horound was an alchemist of the city of Nimpeth in the Vilhon Reach in the mid–14 century DR.\nFollowing an outbreak of a heretofore unknown disease in the Vilhon Reach in the late 1350s DR, Thoround reported a use for the bodily fluids, that is, the spittle or blood, of humans affected by the disease. Thoround claimed if the fluid was used in the making of ink for writing a forget spell, then the process could be made simpler and cheaper. Moreover, if the fluid was used in the ink for any spell, then the spell would disappear from the page upon casting from a spellbook in the normal manner—but would spontaneously reappear between 3 and 12 days later, provided the page remained intact."
