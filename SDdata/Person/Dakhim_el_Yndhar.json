        "mainbody": "Dakhim el Yndhar was a former caleph arcane of Almraiven.\nWhile one of the most powerful wizards alive in Calimshan in 1370 DR, the elderly wizard chose to live as a hermit in one of the minarets in northern Memnon. From his simple-looking tower, he spent his time making specialty magic carpets and other magic item variants. While the syl-pasha tried to bribe him to move to Calimport and provide his services at court, the old enchanter despised politics."
