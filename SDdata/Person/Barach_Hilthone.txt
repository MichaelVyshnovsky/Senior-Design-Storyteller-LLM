'''Barach Hilthone''' was a servant of [[Gond]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1356 DR]], Barach and his companions from [[Tilver's Gap]] were traveling south of [[Daggerdale]] when they were attacked by a band of [[orc]]s. They fled into the nearby mountains and took refuge within an abandoned mountain fortress. They discovered a cache of treasure inside, including a glowing, [[magic]]al [[sword]] but were chased out by an [[beholder|"eye-covered monster"]]. When the group returned to [[Tilverton]], a few members of the fighting band went missing and Barach refused to surrender the sword to the [[Temple of Gond Wondermaker]], claiming it as his own loot.
