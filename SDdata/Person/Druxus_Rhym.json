        "mainbody": "Druxus Rhym was the Zulkir of Transmutation within the Red Wizards of Thay in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDruxus was a skinny, stork-legged man, with a weak chin and a bulge of flab at the waist-line. Tattoos covered his body.\nDruxus wore many repositories of magic, such as rings, a silver-and-obsidian amulet around his neck, even the very tattoos on his body.\nHe had only to concentrate for his magical repositories to release their magic and bestow upon him the strength of a giant, turn his attackers to stone, or whisk himself across the realm to a place of safety.\nAn ally of Szass Tam, Rhym was a major proponent of trade over isolationism in Thay in the early 1370s DR.\nUnder Druxus Rhyms leadership, Thayan enclaves across the Realms were selling amulets of resistance, making them common items circa 1372 DR. These amulets were relatively cheap to make and provided the Red Wizards with a significant source of profit.\nDespite his magical prowess, Rhym was assassinated on Mirtul 5 in the , by an unknown assailant in his own bedroom. His replacement as Zulkir was Samas Kul."
