'''Nigel Thunderstorm''' was a [[dwarf]] chef of [[Citadel Adbar]] in the late 15th century [[DR]].

==History==
Nigel was the personal chef of King [[Harbromm]].

During the late stages of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in [[1485 DR]], he was surprised when he discovered that the dwarves' strategy was to counterattack using the closed tunnels under the dwarven strongholds.
