        "mainbody": "he Oracle of Nasmen, also called the Sumbar Oracle, was a mysterious being found on the island of Sumbar in the Pirate Isles in 1359 DR.\nThe oracle appeared as a large well atop a ridge.\nThe Oracle of Nasmen would answer a single question provided a proper offering was made. Though the Oracles answer was often confusing, it was never known to lie once the entire prophecy was understood at a later date. A querent would toss the proposed offering down the well. It appeared that offerings of higher value yielded answers with more clarity and accuracy. A voice would rise from the depths of the well with the answer to the question. Answers were often given in the form of riddles or poetry.\nInteracting with the Oracle was not without its risks. There was a chance that, after receiving an answer to their question, a querent would then enact events to bring about their own demise."
