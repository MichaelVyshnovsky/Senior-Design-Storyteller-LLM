Angelo Dosan was a corrupt Flaming Fist officer who worked for Sarevok during the Iron crisis of 1368 DR.
He was a man who was greedy for greater wealth and power, but was not foolish enough to cross those he knew would be a true threat.
Angelo was also the father of the fearsome warrior Shar-Teel, from whom he was estranged.
Within the Flaming Fist, Angelo had a number of loyal soldiers that chose to serve him over the Baldurian council, namely the soldiers Benjy and Dilos.
In the , briefly ascended to the rank of commander of the Flaming Fist following the assassination of Scar and incapacitation of Duke Eltan. While he had the power, Commander Angelo agreed to turn over command of the Fist to Sarevok Anchev during his coronation as Grand Duke.
Angelo accompanied Sarevok when he was exposed as a scheming villain in front of the Baldurian nobility. They fled to the temple of Bhaal in the Undercity along with Sarevoks other cronies, where they were slain by Gorions Ward and his party.
