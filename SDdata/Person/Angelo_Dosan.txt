'''Angelo Dosan''' was a corrupt [[Flaming Fist]] officer who worked for [[Sarevok]] during the [[Iron crisis]] of [[1368 DR]].

{{Quote|Friends of [[Eltan|Duke Eltan]] can expect only death from Angelo's new order.|Flaming Fist soldier [[Benjy]], on Commander Angelo's rise to power.}}

==Personality==
He was a man who was greedy for greater wealth and power, but was not foolish enough to cross those he knew would be a true threat.

==Relationships==
Angelo was also the father of the fearsome warrior [[Shar-Teel]], from whom he was estranged.

Within the Flaming Fist, Angelo had a number of loyal soldiers that chose to serve him over the Baldurian council, namely the soldiers [[Benjy]] and [[Dilos]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, briefly ascended to the rank of commander of the Flaming Fist following the assassination of [[Hurbold Duethkatha|Scar]] and incapacitation of [[Duke Eltan]]. While he had the power, Commander Angelo agreed to turn over command of the Fist to [[Sarevok Anchev]] during his coronation as [[Grand Duke]].

Angelo accompanied Sarevok when he was exposed as a scheming villain in front of the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|Baldurian nobility]]. They fled to the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|temple]] of [[Bhaal]] in the [[Undercity]] along with Sarevok's other cronies, where they were slain by [[Abdel Adrian|Gorion's Ward]] and his party.
