They met each day for a month, during which time Amedahast fell for Azoun, but was crushed when she discovered him with another woman.\n\nAmedahast liked cats and introduced them to [[Suzail]] after a plague in [[Marsember]]. She kept around a dozen in her chambers.\n\nAmedahast created the [[longsword]] ''[[Orbyn]]'', one of the [[Cormyrean Swords of State]], for King [[Duar Obarskyr|Duar]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|629}}, Amedahast destroyed herself in a Suzail townhouse by breaking her staff and unleashing the magic within it, killing the traitorous [[Luthax]] and his conspirators in the plot against the Crown."
