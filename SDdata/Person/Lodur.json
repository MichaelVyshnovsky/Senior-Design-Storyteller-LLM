        "mainbody": "'''Lodur the Brave''', also known as '''Lodur Iron-Bollocks''', '''Lodur the Foolhardy''', and '''Lodur the Dullard''', was a dimwitted [[cleric]], who lived in infamy sometime long before the beginning of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Lodur's name was remembered by sages thanks to his commission in creating a special type of [[weapon]] from another world, designed to smite and explode the [[undead]]. Lodur the Brave heard of tales of strange and mighty [[pole-arm]] weapons possibly once wielded by a hero named Lucerne or maybe came from a place called Lucerne. He was also unsure if Lucerne, the place, had anything to do with the far-away land or a king or a deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or \"something of that nature, I am most certain.\" This strange and expensive commission was accepted by a [[dwarf|dwarven]] master smith, who promised ''[[The Hammer of Lucerne]]'' would be ready in two months. The dwarf consulted his clan's lore-master, and surprisingly, a weapon that Lodur the Dullard commissioned did exist. It was recorded that such a weapon came from a trader from the extra-planar city of [[Sigil]] who traversed the planes extensively. The smith used the Sigil designs and fashioned the infamous [[enchanted]] weapon. When Lodur Iron-Bollocks returned to the stronghold, he was shocked to find an odd-looking spiked pole-arm instead of a mighty [[hammer]] he expected. As a cleric, he was not allowed to wield a piercing weapon. Lodur raged and ranted at the master smith but eventually left the so-called \"Lucerne Hammer\" and full payment behind."
