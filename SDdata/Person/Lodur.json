        "mainbody": "Lodur the Brave, also known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard, was a dimwitted cleric, who lived in infamy sometime long before the beginning of the 14 century DR.\nLodurs name was remembered by sages thanks to his commission in creating a special type of weapon from another world, designed to smite and explode the undead. Lodur the Brave heard of tales of strange and mighty pole-arm weapons possibly once wielded by a hero named Lucerne or maybe came from a place called Lucerne. He was also unsure if Lucerne, the place, had anything to do with the far-away land or a king or a deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or \"something of that nature, I am most certain.\" This strange and expensive commission was accepted by a dwarven master smith, who promised The Hammer of Lucerne would be ready in two months. The dwarf consulted his clans lore-master, and surprisingly, a weapon that Lodur the Dullard commissioned did exist. It was recorded that such a weapon came from a trader from the extra-planar city of Sigil who traversed the planes extensively. The smith used the Sigil designs and fashioned the infamous enchanted weapon. When Lodur Iron-Bollocks returned to the stronghold, he was shocked to find an odd-looking spiked pole-arm instead of a mighty hammer he expected. As a cleric, he was not allowed to wield a piercing weapon. Lodur raged and ranted at the master smith but eventually left the so-called \"Lucerne Hammer\" and full payment behind."
