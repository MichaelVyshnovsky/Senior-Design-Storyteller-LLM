Nammna was a merchant from the city of Milvarune in Thesk in the 14th century DR.
Nammna partnered with six other merchants—Alvund of Ormpetarr, Chond of Calaunt, Dzunn of Sheirtalar, Jhasso of Baldurs Gate, Pomphur of Almraiven, and Shield of Everlund—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Nammnas own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Nammna and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
