'''Nammna''' was a merchant from the city of [[Milvarune]] in [[Thesk]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

Nammna partnered with six other merchants—[[Alvund]] of [[Ormpetarr]], [[Chond]] of [[Calaunt]], [[Dzunn]] of [[Sheirtalar]], [[Jhasso]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Pomphur]] of [[Almraiven]], and [[Shield (merchant)|Shield]] of [[Everlund]]—to form the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]]. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Nammna's own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the [[coster]].

Nammna and the Seven Suns were in business by [[1358 DR]], and still going by [[1374 DR]].
