        "mainbody": "Kalitrates was a drow elf working with the slaver ring undercover in the Oasis of the White Palm in Raurin in the .\nKalitrates stood guard just outside of the room where Zomara stayed. He would be ready to assist if he heard noise elsewhere in the compound, however.\nKalitrates had a short sword and dagger, chain mail, and a small shield all of these were enchanted. He also wielded a single javelin coated with drow poison. Finally, he wore boots of elvenkind and a cloak of elvenkind, which eased his avoidance of fire-based attacks. All of his equipment would soon disintegrate if exposed to sunlight."
