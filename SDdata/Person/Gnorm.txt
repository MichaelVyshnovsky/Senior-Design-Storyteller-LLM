Gnorm the gnome was the proprietor of the Dragons Jaws tavern and inn in Suzail.
Gnorm was exceptionally friendly and was known to be the life of any party, but he had a tendency to tell really bad jokes. He greeted regular patrons by name and always made a point to welcome newcomers to his establishment.
Gnorm was a retired adventurer, and he was skilled at axe-, knife-, and halfling-throwing, being the inns champion in all three competitions.
