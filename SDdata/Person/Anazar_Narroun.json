        "mainbody": "'''Anazar Narroun''' was a [[priest]] of [[Amaunator]] from the town of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "Description": "Anazar was a [[human]] man with sharp features, light skin, and black hair gathered in a tight ponytail. He wore [[robe]]s of Amaunator's clergy.",
        "History": "During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the mid-1480s DR, Anazar Narroun helped to organize a group of Evenors as they responded to emerging crises. While [[Derevon Ybir]] wanted all efforts devoted to repairing the town's barricades, he prioritized the priestess [[Meena Follakin]] and her request to to investigate a strange disease that had emerged in Eveningstar's [[Eveningstar War Hospital|War Hospital]], transforming infected men and women into [[red musk zombie]]s. He sent a team of [[adventurer]]s to aid her, which quickly put an end to [[Peron Uthe]]'s zombie rampage. He then directed the team to [[Eolynn Arva]] and the threat at [[Uthe Lodge]], which saved Eveningstar as a whole from the [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]].\n\nThe last excursion put the adventurers in contact with the [[Harpers]] through [[Jussko Kwahn]] and his fellows [[Kirinel Zay]] and [[Tarim Inavule]], who were posing as concerned and unusually-capable travelers. Anazar was happy to let these conspicuous do-gooders help in tracking down the once-beloved [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] at [[Thorngap]], first to [[Thorn Hollow]] and then the [[Druid's Deep]]. By the combined efforts of everyone involved, Halsaime was finally cornered at the Deep and killed, and his [[Halsaime's staff|evil artifact]] of a [[staff]] destroyed."
