On [[Eleint 18]], in preparation, Butcher [[Skedmoor]] delivered beef, lamb, poultry, and fish to the inn, but Spoondrift held up the delivery by inspecting cuts of meat. Afterward, Jasper tried to interview Spoondrift about his sighting of the ghost, which had since been discovered to be [[Dovo]] in disguise when he was found murdered. But, even a full year later, Spoondrift maintained his contempt for Jasper, even still calling him \"slop boy\" and only blamed the killing on Rolf.",
        "Personality": "Spoondrift was a thoroughly mean-spirited man: arrogant, impatient, and holding long and petty grudges. He beat his employees, one time vicious enough to scar the slop boy [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]]'s buttock. True to his name, Spoondrift ate heavily, spending a good deal of his profits on food for himself, while for the inn he cut corners and substituted cheaper meats, such as mutton in the lamb stew and using [[horse]] meat in place of beef or stag meat.",
        "Description": "He was large and fat, owing to his heavy eating.",
        "Relationships": "He somehow had a wife.",
        "History": "When Jasper, having been \"hired\" by [[Benelaius]] as his servant in [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, told Spoondrift he was leaving his slop boy job, he was enraged by the news and shouted at him until he left.\n\nOver time, part of the Sheaf of Wheat's roof became damaged but Spoondrift left it too long to get it fixed and leaks caused the beams and joists below to rot. Finally, he hired the local roofer [[Rolf (roofer)|Rolf]] to repair it in around [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. However, one midnight, heavy boxes of wood shingles left on the roof fell through the floors and rained shingles down on Spoondrift and his wife in their bed. While Spoondrift blamed Rolf, Rolf denied the rotten beams were his fault. Rolf's father, also a roofer, offered to share the cost of rebuilding, but Spoondrift refused. They took the matter to a magistrate in [[Wheloon]], and argued about it through the rest of the year. \n\nOn the night of [[Flamerule 21]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Spoondrift spotted the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]].\n\n{{fq\n| text   = \"As you know.\" Well, don't we speak high and mighty now.
