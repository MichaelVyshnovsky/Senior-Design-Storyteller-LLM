Arthindol, also known as the Terraseer or T Source, was originally a powerful ancient sarrukh lord who eventually became a lich and thereby survived the downfall of the ancient progenitor race. He dwelt, ever since, in the ruins of ancient Oreme, rarely interacting with the outside world. Most notably he served as a source of ancient arcane knowledge for the Netherese Empire.
Arthindol built the watchtower at Old Owl Well, as can be asked of Agatha.
