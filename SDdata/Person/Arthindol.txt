'''Arthindol''', also known as the '''Terraseer''' or '''T Source''', was originally a powerful ancient [[sarrukh]] lord who eventually became a [[lich]] and thereby survived the downfall of the ancient progenitor race. He dwelt, ever since, in the ruins of ancient [[Oreme]], rarely interacting with the outside world. Most notably he served as a source of ancient arcane knowledge for the [[Netherese Empire]].

==Activities==
Arthindol built the watchtower at [[Old Owl Well]], as can be asked of [[Agatha]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|-345}}, the Terraseer appeared before [[Karsus]] and stated "''[[Mystryl]] was about to face her greatest challenge - one that could alter the perception of magic for all time.''"
