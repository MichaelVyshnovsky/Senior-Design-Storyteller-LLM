Dennon Nosmile was a legendary halfling and a cautionary tale who lived sometime before the late 15 century DR.
Dennon Nosmiles name was a reminder to all young halflings of the danger that a walnut posed. The cautionary tale taught youths that it was perilous to open walnuts thick shells with their teeth.
