Lady '''Ilsevele Miritar''' was a [[sun elf]] [[spellarcher]] from the [[Queen's Guard]] on [[Evermeet]], who went on to become the [[Coronal]] of restored [[Cormanthyr]].

==Description==
Ilsevele was pale with copper-colored hair.

==Possessions==
She carried a magical bow crafted from deep red [[yew]]. She wore magical [[leather armor]] strengthened with steel rings, which was appropriate for a captain of the spellarchers. She also carried a pair of fine elven [[short sword]]s. Ilsevele's spellbook was a slender volume with silver clasps, bound between thin sheets of [[laspar]] wood.

==Relationships==
Ilsevele's mother and father were [[Ilyyela Miritar]] and [[Seiveril Miritar]] respectively, both of whom were deceased.

She was the partner and betrothed of [[Araevin Teshurr]] until the couple parted ways when Ilsevele fell in love with the resurrected [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]], whom she eventually wed.

Ilsevele had a fine gray [[horse|destrier]] named [[Swiftwind]].

==History==
At around the age of 170,<ref>()<ref group="note">Ilsevele's age is determined from Araevin being almost 100 years her elder. she worked with her father on the [[Elven Crusade]] to [[Myth Drannor]], and after his death took up leadership of the [[Army of Myth Drannor]]. After she defeated the armies of [[Scyllua Darkhope]], she was visited by the [[Srinshee]] and granted the ''[[Rulers' Blade]]'', becoming seventh [[Coronal]] of the rebuilt realm of [[Cormanthyr]] with Fflar as her consort.

After the second destruction of Myth Drannor in [[1487 DR]], Ilsevele and Fflar led their people to [[Semberholme]].
