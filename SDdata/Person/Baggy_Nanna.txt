Baggy Nanna was a member of the Sewn Sisters, a hag coven that maintained the Soulmonger in the lowest levels of the Tomb of the Nine Gods during the late 15 century DR.
Baggy Nanna appeared to have a bag over her head, from under which a cockerel, a viper, or a terrier emerged to speak for the hag.
The hag had a heartstone, a soul bag, and three goblin fingers on her person.
Baggy Nanna was a member of the Sewn Sisters, who were the guardians and caretakers of the atropal in the Tomb of the Nine Gods. For the promise of infinite souls to harvest, the coven joined Acererak in his feeding of the atropal.
Baggy Nanna and the Sewn Sisters had a fearful reputation in the lower planes before they started working with Acererak the demilich.
