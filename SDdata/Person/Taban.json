        "mainbody": "Taban was a gladiator active in Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was stubborn but proud. If defeated in a fight, he became ashamed and eager to prove himself. He was also a gambler who placed bets at Port Nyanzarus Executioners Run.\nAs a result of his gambling habit, Taban came to owe a debt of 500 gp to a bookie named Klahu. Despite having enough wealth to pay off his debt (in the form of gemstones), Taban refused to repay it. During the events of the death curse, Klahu sought to hire adventurers to help collect the debt."
