'''Rannek''', also known as '''Rannek of Nesmé''', was a [[human]] [[fighter]] from [[Nesmé]] who was a member of the [[Riders of Nesmé]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Rannek was active in the defense of Nesmé when it was attacked by [[Proffit]] and his band of [[troll]]s, although he was young and inexperienced. While on watch, he made a critical error that earned him the enmity of [[Galen Firth]]: he was hit from behind and pinned under a boulder. When the refugees were safe, Rannek fled east.

With nothing to lose and drawn to [[Damara]] by a force he couldn't explain, he joined with [[Zhai]] and [[Illius]] and fought through the [[Gemspark mine]], where he accidentally freed [[Cireka]] and [[Ygorl]]. The three compantions then set out on a quest to claim a ''[[demon stone]]'' from [[Chult]] in order to imprison Cireka and Ygorl once more. In the course of their adventures, Rannek helped to slay the [[red dragon]] [[Caminus]] and eventually avenged himself on Proffit's trolls in a battle at [[Mithral Hall]].

In recognition for their valor in defeating Cireka and Ygorl, Rannek and his companions were granted rulership over [[Vaasa]] on behalf of King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]. The sword that Rannek took from Cireka, the [[Silver Sword of Gith]], carried the impending threat that the [[githyanki]] would come to try and take it back.
