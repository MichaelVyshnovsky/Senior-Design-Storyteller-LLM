Rannek, also known as Rannek of Nesmé, was a human fighter from Nesmé who was a member of the Riders of Nesmé in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Rannek was active in the defense of Nesmé when it was attacked by Proffit and his band of trolls, although he was young and inexperienced. While on watch, he made a critical error that earned him the enmity of Galen Firth he was hit from behind and pinned under a boulder. When the refugees were safe, Rannek fled east.
With nothing to lose and drawn to Damara by a force he couldnt explain, he joined with Zhai and Illius and fought through the Gemspark mine, where he accidentally freed Cireka and Ygorl. The three compantions then set out on a quest to claim a demon stone from Chult in order to imprison Cireka and Ygorl once more. In the course of their adventures, Rannek helped to slay the red dragon Caminus and eventually avenged himself on Proffits trolls in a battle at Mithral Hall.
In recognition for their valor in defeating Cireka and Ygorl, Rannek and his companions were granted rulership over Vaasa on behalf of King Gareth Dragonsbane. The sword that Rannek took from Cireka, the Silver Sword of Gith, carried the impending threat that the githyanki would come to try and take it back.
