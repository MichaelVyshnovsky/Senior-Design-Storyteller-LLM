'''Goddard''' was a [[Netherese]] [[priest]] who served as an Underchief at [[Constabulary Branch Three]] in [[Eileanar]] in [[Netheril]] before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Goddard helped manage the constables of the branch alongside Underchiefs [[Morian]] and [[Cadogen]] for Chief Constable [[Emblemat]]. Despite the harsh conditions she loved her job, and was completely loyal to Emblemat. She was especially adept at engendering respect from her underlings, with whom she was always available to talk and give advice to. Although she herself admitted she didn't have all the answers, she always did her best to help and would point the supplicant in the right direction to get the best possible advice.
