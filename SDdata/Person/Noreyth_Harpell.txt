'''Noreyth Harpell''' was the master [[vampire]] of [[Dhusarra yr Fadila el Abhuk]].

==History==
He was attacked in [[1315 DR]] by the [[Company of the Red Dawn]], who were sent by the [[undead]] vampire [[Artor Morlin]] because Noreyth encroached upon his territory. 

Noreyth and Dhusarra escaped from the ambush, but she later murdered Harpell in his crypt.
