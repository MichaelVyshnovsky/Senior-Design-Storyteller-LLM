'''Motoharu Kaijitsu''' was a [[ninja]]/[[yakuza]] adventurer in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]]. and [[1358]]

==History==
Kaijitsu was always able to balance his ninja life under the name '''Ito''' with his yakuza one, using the one to have an alibi for the other and vice versa. He managed to help both his ninja family and his yakuza gang to prosper. His greatest fear was being discovered as a ninja, losing everything from his yakuza life, and dying. 

In 1357 DR, Kaijitsu was among the candidates chosen by [[Ko Mei Kho]] for a mission in [[Akari]].

In 1358 Kaijitsu during a a yakuza family gathering made a particularly messy incident resulting in a severe loss of personal honor and his exile from the family. He was in search for a method to regain honor when was possibly approached by [[Ko Ho San]]
