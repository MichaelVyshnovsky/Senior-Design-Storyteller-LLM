        "mainbody": "Nurnath was a farmer in Red Larch circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. He raised chickens in barns he owned just north of the town on the Long Road. His large barn with a green tile roof was a landmark on the road. Turning east at the barn onto a well-used cart track took a traveler between Mragan Gulthers orchards and the grazing pasture of Indurr Stalnstern for about a mile before it climbed the hill where Old Angraths Smokehouse was located."
