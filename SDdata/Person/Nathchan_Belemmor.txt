'''Nathchan Belemmor''' was a [[human]] man of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]], who lived ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

For a human, Belemmor was a [[gem]]-cutter of unequaled talent, so great he worked only on regalia for the nobility and even for royalty. However, he was notorious for his fits of rage. He was one of the most well-known Procampans of his day.
