Old Tarlow was a wererat of the Riverside Rats gang, who dwelt in the Wheloon Prison of Cormyr during the late 15 century DR.
As a wererat, Tarlow had white fur, long gray hair and a beard.
Old Tarlow lived in Wheloon Prison with his fellow gangsters until they were forced out by the Night Brigade under Storna Harnwood, who turned their hideout into a Temple of Shar. After being driven away, Tarlow represented the Rats as a whole and got outside help as they launched counterattacks on the Night Brigade.
