{{quote
|The Night Brigade is a gang, in other words. Better organized than most Wheloon gangs, true. And they're in with the Shar worshippers, which gives them an extra edge inside the prison.<br/>But they're still just a gang. They live by the sword. And if we Riverside Rats get our revenge, they're going to die by it as well!

==Description==
As a wererat, Tarlow had white fur, long gray hair and a beard.

==History==
Old Tarlow lived in Wheloon Prison with his fellow gangsters until they were forced out by the [[Night Brigade]] under [[Storna Harnwood]], who turned their hideout into a [[Temple of Shar (Wheloon)|Temple of Shar]]. After being driven away, Tarlow represented the Rats as a whole and got outside help as they launched counterattacks on the Night Brigade.
