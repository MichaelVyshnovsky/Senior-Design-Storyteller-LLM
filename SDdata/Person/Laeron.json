        "mainbody": "aeron was a decrepit mummy who dwelled in an ancient Netherese tomb beneath the Stonelands.\nLaeron had a number of arcane spells at his disposal, including chain lightning, displacement, Otilukes freezing sphere, protection from elements, mass, and wail of the banshee.\nLaeron was interred in his tomb with a number of other undead and servitors, including wheeps, quells, skeletons, and tomb guardian constructs. Around the time of the Darkening in the late 15 century DR, the adventurers Jarus Brithandir, Kirina Aelorothi, Tristran of Daggerford, Popkin Shortshanks, Helayna, and Liantor Stoneborn discovered the tomb and cut their way through a few of the guardians before finding a passage hidden behind Laerons throne. The adventurers passed deeper underground into natural caverns below the tomb, and by the time Laeron was up and about they were long gone. A second wave of invaders arrived to rescue the first group, and while Laeron and his minions put up a strong fight he was destroyed."
