'''Arvyn Umbryl''' was the proprietor of the [[Smiling Satyr]] tavern outside [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Circa'' the 1370s DR, Arvyn Umbryl appeared to be a strong and muscular man of average height who was starting to grow a belly. His shoulder-length hair was starting to grey and his face was always clean-shaven. He had icy blue eyes and hooked nose. Diagonally across Arvyn's left forearm stretched a scar from his old adventuring days.

Arvyn's usual garb included thick heavy [[boot]]s, leather beeches, and open pirate's shirt. When he was at the Smiling Satyr, Arvyn wore a leather apron. He hid a knife and a [[dagger]] tucked away in each of his boots.

==Personality==
He was a warm and pleasant man who spoke in gravelly voice.

==Possessions==
Arvyn owned the Smiling Satyr tavern, the hill it stood on, and the two fields on either side, which he allowed to be used as campsites. Among the antique [[weapon]]s, broken [[shield]]s, skulls of monsters, and other trophies of adventures past on the walls, behind the bar were two crossed magic ''[[battleaxe]]s of [[dancing]]''. Arvyn, and only Arvyn, could command these to animate to defend himself and his staff.

==History==
Arvyn was a retired [[adventurer]], but his accomplishments, if any, were unknown to the likes of [[Volo]]. Regardless, he was running the Smiling Satyr by [[1365 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]], alongside his quiet wife [[Marra Umbryl]] who ran the establishment's kitchen. Their three daughters [[Dauntra Umbryl|Dauntra]], [[Shammarra Umbryl|Shammarra]], and impish [[Lantrue Umbryl|Lantrue]] ran business errands, tended to guests' [[horse]]s, and helped with the business.

==Relationships==
He had a descendant in the person of [[Gharwin Umbryl]], who ran the Smiling Satyr in the late 1480s DR.<ref>
