'''Dalvar Corzon''' was a captain of the [[Cormyrean Freesails]] in [[1359 DR]].

==History==
Dalvar was trained by the clerics of [[Mielikki]].

For a few years, Dalvar tried to train [[seagull]]s to act as couriers. He had little success but was still able to send some messages to their destinations, which proved to be decisive during the [[Time of Troubles]] and the [[Horde War]]. He was promoted to captain of the ''[[Gullswing]]'' by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] himself.

==Personality==
Dalvar was totally devoted to his country, always ready to defeat its enemies. He had developed an uncanny sense of pirates' activities, building a reputation as a dangerous enemy among pirates. His cleric teachers told him that, thanks to his exploits, the goddess possibly would permit Dalvar to cast [[spell]]s like they did. This and the recognition from King Azoun made Dalvar a bit too eager for battle, taking bigger risks any time he sailed. Some started to think he needed to be humbled, for his own sake.
