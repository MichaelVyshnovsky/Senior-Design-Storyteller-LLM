Yeenoghu
Tekeli-li () was a gnoll vampire, and a former Fang of Yeenoghu that lurked in Icewind Dale during the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
Tekeli-li was once a mortal gnoll, who led his pack across the frozen lands of Icewind Dale. In the , the local Reghedmen barbarians routed the pack, forcing them to flee across the Reghed Glacier. To ensure their survival, the pack sacrificed themselves one by one to their Fang Tekeli-li, granting him sustenance to live through the winter.
To the goddess Auril, Tekeli-lis ravenous hunger represented the unending "consumption" of winter. Auril interred the vampiric gnoll within the Caves of Hunger, imprisoning him in the ice of the Reghed Glacier as the passageway out froze over. He remained trapped there for over a century until a group of adventurers re-opened the passageway.
