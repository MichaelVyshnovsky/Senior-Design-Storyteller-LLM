'''Krydle''' ({{Pronounce|CRY|dull|refs={{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|8}}}}) was a [[half-elf]] [[thief]] and poet who lived in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was estranged from his nobleman father [[Coran]] and hated the politics of the city, particularly the schism between its upper and lower cities.

{{quote|Baldur's Gate is a city of ''misfits'' and ''outsiders''. Trust me. You'll fit right in.|Krydle to [[Delina]]}}

==Personality==
Despite being estranged from his father and his hatred of the city's nobles' machinations,{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4}}

==Relationships==
Throughout his life, Krydle was a member of the city's vast criminal network.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 1|5-6}} 

As an adult, he shared his hidden underground safehouse with his [[halfling]] friend and trusted ally [[Shandie]] and formed a group of adventurers with [[Minsc]] and [[Delina]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|7-10}}

Krydle and Shandie shared a close bond, both wanting little more than to continue their life of crime. As they saw it, their lifestyle benefited the poorest and most unfortunate Baldurian citizens.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|6}}

==History==
===Early Life===
[[File:Blades of Burgust.png|thumb|right|300px|A young Krydle (far right) with the [[Blades of Burgust]].]]
Krydle youthful independent streak led to him joining a group of outcast criminals known as the Blades of Burgust.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|2}} He thoroughly enjoyed a life of what he saw as justified crime and constant thrills, stealing from greedy nobles and unscrupulous merchants. When their leader Burgust began transforming the group from a gang of ne'er-do-wells to something more akin an thieves' guild, the extra notoriety led to its founding members being killed, and Krydle left the group. 

Unfortunately this decision came back to haunt Krydle as Burgust ordered the death of his mother as revenge. Krydle carried the burden of his mother's death with him for years.

===Starting Adventure===
Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Krydle ran into Minsc and Delina, finding them at odds with the city watch. Krydle felt compelled to aid them, taking them to his hidden safehouse. After hearing their tale, he agreed to help smuggle them from the upper city to the lower city, where they could not be easily found, and to try to get information on Delina's twin brother, [[Deniak]]. He also revealed that the tensions between the lower and upper cities were the worst they had been for some time.

[[File:Heroes of Baldur's Gate OG.gif|thumb|left|250px|Krydle introduces himself to his future companions, [[Minsc]] and [[Delina]].]]

In order to aid them, he negotiated a deal with [[Osgur Hallorn|the Fetcher]], who agreed to provide safe passage in exchange for a message to be delivered to Coran. Krydle agreed, swearing and muttering to himself. After an ambush by a splinter faction of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in an alley, he started to realize the danger the duo was in, so he decided to go alone to a [[Parliament of Peers]] revel to deliver the letter.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|13-21}}

At the revel, he found his father and angrily gave him the letter. Coran tried to talk to his son, ultimately his "guidance" being rejected as "manipulation". When asked why they could not have a conversation, Krydle angrily responded he did not have anything to say, calling his father "part of the city's illustrious oppressors" and saying he "rejected [his father's] principles at every turn" and "Mother would be so proud".{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|8-9}}

A battle ensued as Delina recognized one of the ambushers. The battle then moved to the rooftops, where she was captured by the Cult of the Dragon while the party in turn captured one of cultists.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|9-19}}

Taking information from the captured cultist, they traveled back to the Fetcher. Krydle manged to get the location of Deniak{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|8-10}} and attacked the Cult, but did not manage to stop the ritual that turned Deniak into a [[red dragon]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 4|13-19,22}}

Chasing a transformed Deniak holding Delina in his claws, Krydle and Shandie acted quickly to get up on a high tower and throw a [[grappling hook]] through the dragon's wing.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|3-10}} The dragon crashed into the tower and became stuck under the rubble, where the party finished it off.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|10-18}} Back to Krydle's and Shandie's hideout, the party talked about the future of Delina as she planned to leave, but her newly found allies made her stay in the "City of Misfits and Outsiders",{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|21}} while also pondering that their new lifestyle as adventurers would require a [[cleric]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 5|22}}

===The Domain of Dread===
The group would find someone to fill that role when they took on a job from father [[Alby]] at the [[Temple of Kelemvor (Baldur's Gate)|local temple]] of [[Kelemvor]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|10-13}} After defending the temple from a pack of [[werewolves]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|17-21}} Krydle and his companions were transported to the realm of [[Barovia]], {{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|19-30}} alongside the [[Kelemvorite]] cleric [[Nerys]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2|3-4}}

[[File:Delina Krydle.png|thumb|right|300px|Krydle suffering the effects the Domain of Dread had on his allies' psyche.]]

While trapped in the otherworldly plain, Krydle and the rest of the party were given shelter at the [[Wizard of Wines]] by [[Adrian Martikov]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|2-4}} That night, Krydle suffered horrible nightmares regarding his deceased mother, slipping into a state where he was inadvertently being choked by Delina, who was suffering hallucinations of her own.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|14-17}} After a brief respite, the group continued on together, Krydle managing to snag a bottle of ''[[Red Dragon Crush]]''.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|19-20}} 

Eventually the group made their way to the fortified settlement of [[Vallaki]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|1-2}} they squared off with the werewolves they encountered back in Baldur's Gate, along with their new [[vampirism|vampiric]] master [[Sangin]], {{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|7-17}} eventually drawing the ire of Baron [[Strahd von Zarovich]] himself.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|20}} The heroes assailed the powerful vampire lord and Krydle was even able to sink a dagger through his neck while Minsc acted as a distraction.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|5-9}} Just as it appeared Strahd could easily decimate the group and take what he desired,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|12-14}} his cursed past sapped his power away, and Delina the wild mage used her magic to transport the everyone to safety.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|15-20}}

===Adventures in the North===
Krydle and his friends, along with the injured Nerys, found themselves in a snowy land obviously farm from the twisted [[Shadowfell]],{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|22}} the [[Spine of the World]] mountains in the [[Frozenfar]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|2}} They were forced to fight off a marauding band of [[ogre]]s, before meeting a new ally in the [[dragonborn]] [[Saarvin]],{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|9-17}} who accompanied them to the nearby town of [[Fireshear]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|1-4}} For the first time in quite a while, the Heroes of Baldur's Gate could get some actual rest, giving Krydle the opportunity to chat up and meet new friends in town.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|5}}

[[File:Krydle, eggs.png|thumb|left|300px|Krydle recovers the eggs of the [[white dragon]] [[Nilanthe]].]]

When a band of [[frost giant]]s led by Lord [[Gryttmort]] assailed the snowbound settlement, the heroes valiantly came to its defense.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|8-13}} Krydle managed to sneak aboard the giants' longboat and free the chained [[white dragon]], turning the tide of battle in their favor.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 2|14-17}} They learned of Gryttmort's scheme to steal an ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'' from a dragon's lair at [[Cold Crag Peak]],{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|1-4}} and set out on the dangerous journey to stop them.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|6-10}} Krydle was reunited with the white dragon he had freed in the previous battle, named [[Nilanthe]]. An agreement was made to recover Nilanthe's stolen eggs from the frost giants, in exchange fore safety of Fireshear's residents.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|12-15}} Unfortunately for them all, the frost giant raiders broke into the dragon's lair and used the ''orb of dragonkind'' to compel Nilanthe with caving in her own lair,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 3|16-20}} giving the heroes short time to escape.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|2}}

Krydle and his companions formed a plan with their new friend Saarvin and his ally [[Dasharra Keldabar]], along with local leaders to formulate their plan.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|4-5}} By riding atop [[griffon]]s over the sea, they snuck aboard the giants' longboat and silently infiltrated their floating glacier fortress.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|8-10}}{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|12-13}} Krydle adeptly recovered Nilanthe's eggs, just before the frost giants were alerted,{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 4|18-20}} and a fierce battle broke out.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|1-7}} Krydle protected the white dragon eggs long enough for enough for Nilanthe to be freed from the ''orb's'' powers and take her revenge on the evil giant raiders.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|8-10}}{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|13}} The group returned to Fireshear as heroes, and Krydle and Shandie were especially ready to return home to Baldur's Gate.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 5|18-20}}

===Return to the City===
[[File:Krydle, Burgust, Coran.png|thumb|right|300px|Krydle and his father [[Coran]] stand over the seemingly defeated [[Burgust]].]]
After sailing back to Baldur's Gate together, the party returned to their old hideout before parting ways for a time.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 1|3-4}} Krydle and Shandie reconnected with [[Heltur]], one of his old associates, learning that the Fetcher of [[Undercellar]] had been kidnapped by his old gang leader Burgust.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|1-3}} Krydle and Shandie tracked down the Fetchers captors, just in time to learn that Burgust was on his way to a secret meeting of the [[Parliament of Peers]] at [[High Hall]] to kill the retired adventurer Coran, Krydle's father, in a final act of vengeance.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|7-10}}

Burgust and his blades set off a smoke bomb at High Hall, distracting everyone long enough to go in for the kill. Fortunately for Coran, Krydle arrived just in time to hold back the killing blow. Father and son fought Burgust alongside one another, putting aside their differences and even bonding as they finally pun an end to the man that slew Krydle's mother.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|12-16}} Krydle and Shandie snuck away during the commotion{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 2|19}} and traveled back to join their friends.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|5}}

One night at a tavern, after a fight got out of hand, Krydle and his band came to discover that their newest member Nerys had been afflicted with [[lycanthropy]] while in Barovia.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|6-9}} They worked with Father Alby to perform a [[ritual]] that would free Nerys from the curse.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|11-13}} With great effort, Krydle and Minsc were able to retrain the transformed and raging Nerys,{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|15}} while Father Alby exised the taint from the young cleric,{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|17}} and she could reunite in peace with her new friends, from whom she drew so much strength.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 4|18-20}} 

===Descent Into the Hells===
[[File:Krydle Oreasha.png|thumb|left|300px|Every time you make a deal with a [[devil]]...]]
Some time during the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} Krydle, Shandie, and Nerys were introduced to [[Aubree Lucent]], a paladin from [[Elturel]] what was recently rescued from a [[hell knight]] by Minsc and Delina.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|9}} The young warrior sought to glean information about her missing friend, using the only clue she had, a mysterious ''[[infernal puzzle box]]''. Krydle and Shandie tracked down a scholar named [[Fremin Greer]], an expert on much to do with the [[lower planes]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|10-12}} They learned that they could find more information from [[Sylvira Savikas]], one of the Great Readers of [[Candlekeep]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 1|20}}

Arriving at Candlekeep,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|6}} the group met with Sylvira and began investigating the ''puzzle box''. During their discussion, one of Delina's [[wild surge]]s transported everyone to the city of Elturel, just as it was dragged down to the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 2|16-20}}{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|4-5}} When a band of [[devil]]s assailed their part of the city,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|2-3}} Krydle and Shandie became separated from the rest of the group,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|7}} and the young [[halfling]] rogue was captured by a gang of [[chain devil]]s.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 3|17-20}}

[[File:Krydle infernal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|...there will always be a cost to pay.]]

The devils offered a bargain to Krydle: offer his soul in order to spare Shandie's life. Unfortunately for those fiends, the [[erinyes]] [[Oreasha]] claimed what was rightfully hers as a more powerful devil. Acting on behalf of the former [[archdevil]] [[Bel]],{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|1-4}} Orishas tasked Krydle with using a ''[[devil talisman]]'' to nullify the [[infernal contract]] signed by the [[Amnizu]] [[Thavius Kreeg]] and stop archdevil [[Zariel]]'s to secure the city of Elturel on Avernus,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|15-16}} in order to protect the lives of all his friends. Krydle agreed to the deal,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|20}} and took Shandie to safety to reunite with their friends.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|17}} After rallying together, the heroes fought against Thavius Kreeg's devilish soldiers,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|5-8}} and Krydle discovered his ''talisman'' had no effect on the contract.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|10}} Eventually Zariel herself descended upon the city, and the group was forced to defend themselves for a time,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|12-16}} until Elturel ascended up from the Hells to [[Toril]].{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|17}}

After a few weeks back in the Heartlands,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|18}} Krydle had the words "soul debt" inscribed in [[infernal language|infernal script]] upon his left forearm.
