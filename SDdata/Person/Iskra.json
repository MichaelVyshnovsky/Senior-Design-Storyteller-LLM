        "mainbody": "skra was Aurils roc mount during the years of the Everlasting Rime.\nIskra was white.\nStashed throughout the rocs nest were a silver dragon egg, an exotic wooden harp decorated with ivory and zircon, and an electrum chain with a pendant of bloodstone. It also included a chest containing gold pieces, a golden ring with a black pearl, and a spell scroll featuring mass cure wounds.\nIn order to maintain the Everlasting Rime, Auril needed to cast a nightly spell from Iskras back.\nIskra had a number of hostile encounters with Angajuk, which left the latter scarred."
