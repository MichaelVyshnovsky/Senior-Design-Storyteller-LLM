        "mainbody": "Lord '''Alathallgo Gathalynker''' was a member of the wealthy but no noble [[Gathalynker]] family of [[Amn]], famously killed ''circa'' [[1270 DR]] by his [[orc]] slaves.",
        "Description": "Alathallgo was an obese man and a cruel slave driver. The wore an [[enchanted]] set of armor when traveling along with his humanoid livestock. His fingers were decorated with ensorcelled [[ring]]s and several magic blades, [[wand]]s, and [[dagger]]s hung on his waist.",
        "History": "Alathallgo Gathalynker was believed to hadbeen slain by a group of orcish shaves who rebelled and attacked their master while traveling the [[Orc Road]] in [[Zehoarastria]] sometime in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. His body was thought to be hidden and buried somewhere along the road that stretched between the settlements of [[Crimmor]] and [[Purskul]]. His body was still adorned in the Lord's magic armor. Alathallgo's skull was uncovered in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, still wearing his distinct decorated [[helmet]].\n\nThe slaver's torso nor his magic armor were found as of the late 14{{th}} century DR. The Gathalynker family regularly hired workers to embark on excavation expeditions in search of the family's famous ancestor's body. Some believed that the orcs consumed the slaver's body after killing him, while others speculated that Alathallgo Gathalynker's body was buried elsewhere. There was also a chance that the body was discovered many years prior; all his magic loot â€“ sold off."
