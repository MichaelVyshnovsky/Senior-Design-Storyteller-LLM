'''Narnra Shalace''' was a [[rogue]]<ref> who called [[Waterdeep]] her home. 

==History==
She was the daughter of the song dragon [[Maerjanthra Shalace]]<ref>
and [[Elminster]].<ref> Her thief name was the Silken Shadow.<ref> Narnra was unaware of the fact that her mother was a dragon (Narnra herself appeared entirely human), and thought that she was dead, as her mother staged her own death so that Narnra could come of age without her assistance.
