Narnra Shalace was a rogue who called Waterdeep her home. 
She was the daughter of the song dragon Maerjanthra Shalace
and Elminster. Her thief name was the Silken Shadow. Narnra was unaware of the fact that her mother was a dragon (Narnra herself appeared entirely human), and thought that she was dead, as her mother staged her own death so that Narnra could come of age without her assistance.
