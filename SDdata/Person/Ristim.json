        "mainbody": "istim was a young human commoner and the nephew of one of his villages elders.\nRistim was a young man with black hair and a noticeably long nose.\nIn 1369 DR, Ristim was one of the unfortunate villagers captured by the Cult of the Dragons slavers. Alongside Tren, Wenta, and Jorsh, the villagers were dragged to the Cults hideout in the basement of the ruined Darnarests tower. Unlike his fellow abductees, Ristim was left in shackles while others were transported to Myth Drannor to work in the Cults excavation project in the Polyandrium. Thankfully, a group of heroes tasked with investigating the missing persons subsequently made their way to Darnarests tower, scattering and slaying the cultists, and rescuing Ristim."
