        "History": "Some time in ancient history, Astaroth—even then a very powerful demon lord—volunteered to fight beside the [[Queen of Chaos]] against the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]], but she rejected him.\n\nEarly in the [[Blood War]], Astaroth infiltrated the ranks of the [[devil]]s, even achieving the post of Treasurer of Hell. His espionage grievously sabotaged the devils' war effort, stopping them from winning any decisive victory against the demon hordes.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|19}}\n\nFinally, however, the arch-devil Gargauth discovered Astaroth's true nature and exposed him. Astaroth escaped Asmodeus's rage and retreated to his dwelling place in the Abyss. Gargauth became Treasurer of Hell himself. Meanwhile, to mortals, Astaroth remained a figure of mystery, a subject of stories but not confirmed to even exist. He was thought to dwell outside the Hells and its leadership, to pursue his own plans whilst working alone. The only thing known for certain was that Astaroth was not an acknowledged power in the Hells.\n\nTo guard against the revenge of the Lords of the [[Nine Hells]], Astaroth laid plans.gauth during his own wanderings as an exile of the Nine Hells, at the command of Asmodeus. The Abyss itself tried to resurrect Astaroth in his assigned pit in the Wells of Darkness, but Gargauth ignited permanent hell-fire there, so Astaroth's body constantly burned even as it reformed.\n\nThereafter, Astaroth was presumed deceased, at least to other fiends.\n\nMeanwhile, Gargauth took Astaroth's name as his alias and stole the worship of his few surviving cultists on [[Toril]], thus receiving his first taste of godhood. He maintained these cults in Astaroth's name.\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a cadre of [[demon]]-spawned [[tiefling]]s arose in the former lands of [[Narfell]]. Naming themselves the [[Scions of Astaroth]], or \"Astarothans\", after the long-dead demon lord, they viewed [[Faerûn]] as another front in the Blood War. Ironically, they set themselves against the [[Knights of the Shield]], a group that unwittingly served Gargauth.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n| source = [[Meraera]] of the [[Olin Gisir|Olin Gisiae]]\n| text   = Hush!

        "Personality": "More than other demons, Astaroth had a deep, undying hatred of devils and sought vengeance against them.",
        "Powers": "Astaroth had a gift for prophecy.",
        "Realm": "Though he ruled no abyssal layer of his own, Astaroth dwelled in a layer filled with steam and floating chunks of burning stone.",
        "Relations": "[[Charsultketh|Helanna Darkstorm]], a leader of the Knights of the Shield around [[1370 DR]], may have once been a consort of Astaroth, but by then she certainly was a consort of Gargauth.<ref group=\"note\">''Powers & Pantheons'' p. 25 says she \"used to be consort of Astaroth\", but it is unclear if this is the demon prince Astaroth or the archdevil Gargauth using his name. ''Cloak & Dagger'' p. 70 establishes Helanna is secretly a demon, Charsultketh, and \"has long been Gargauth's consort\". It is unclear if this is a change or correction of the previous information. As the former is a past relationship and the latter is a current relationship, it is possible Charsultketh switched from Astaroth to Gargauth.",
        "Summoning": "A wielder of [[pact magic]] like a [[binder]] could summon the vestige of Astaroth and gain powers thereby. His seal had to be drawn on stone that had recently been burned then doused with cold water. He manifested in a cloud of steam from the seal, condensing into the visage of a handsome [[human]] with draconic and feather wings, with flicking serpentine tongue. He appeared nervous. His body was forever being slowly consumed by hellfire.\n\nA binder who bound and made a pact with Astaroth exuded a stink of brimstone and their eyes were covered by a cloudy film. In manner, they became morose and fatalistic, thanks to a vague but unshakeable feeling of impending doom. Astaroth demanded they attack devils whenever the opportunity occurred. In return, Astaroth bestowed several powers. One was to see into the future, as with the ''[[divination]]'' [[spell]]. Another was the ability to pass among [[fiend]]s of all kinds, with skill in deceit and disguise. The binder could also wound creatures that could only be harmed by [[silver]], like many devils. Finally, they could burn with black Abyssal flame: all magical flame they produced turned vile, and the binder could hurl a ''[[fireball]]'' of this kind thrice a day.",
        "The False Astaroth": "After slaying the demon lord, Gargauth used \"Astaroth\" as an alias for his misdeeds. Gargauth provided the spell ''[[Astaroth's augmentation]]'' to priests of other gods who unwisely called upon him.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|30}}"
