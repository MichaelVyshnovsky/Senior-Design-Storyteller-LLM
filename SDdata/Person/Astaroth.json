        "mainbody": "Astaroth was a mighty demon prince of the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, His title was Diabolus and he was concerned with matters of prophecy. while the original Astaroth became a vestige.\nSome time in ancient history, Astaroth—even then a very powerful demon lord—volunteered to fight beside the Queen of Chaos against the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, but she rejected him.\nEarly in the Blood War, Astaroth infiltrated the ranks of the devils, even achieving the post of Treasurer of Hell. His espionage grievously sabotaged the devils war effort, stopping them from winning any decisive victory against the demon hordes.\nFinally, however, the arch-devil Gargauth discovered Astaroths true nature and exposed him. Astaroth escaped Asmodeuss rage and retreated to his dwelling place in the Abyss. Gargauth became Treasurer of Hell himself. Meanwhile, to mortals, Astaroth remained a figure of mystery, a subject of stories but not confirmed to even exist. He was thought to dwell outside the Hells and its leadership, to pursue his own plans whilst working alone. The only thing known for certain was that Astaroth was not an acknowledged power in the Hells.\nTo guard against the revenge of the Lords of the Nine Hells, Astaroth laid plans.gauth during his own wanderings as an exile of the Nine Hells, at the command of Asmodeus. The Abyss itself tried to resurrect Astaroth in his assigned pit in the Wells of Darkness, but Gargauth ignited permanent hell-fire there, so Astaroths body constantly burned even as it reformed.\nThereafter, Astaroth was presumed deceased, at least to other fiends.\nMeanwhile, Gargauth took Astaroths name as his alias and stole the worship of his few surviving cultists on Toril, thus receiving his first taste of godhood. He maintained these cults in Astaroths name.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, a cadre of demon-spawned tieflings arose in the former lands of Narfell. Naming themselves the Scions of Astaroth, or \"Astarothans\", after the long-dead demon lord, they viewed Faerûn as another front in the Blood War. Ironically, they set themselves against the Knights of the Shield, a group that unwittingly served Gargauth.\nCirca 1374 DR, an Olin Gisir of the North named Meraera and her party explored the ruins of the temple to Astaroth.It is unclear if the temple to Astaroth was found within ruins of the elven realm of Siluvanede, which Meraera was also said to be exploring, though this is likely given her interests and that realms history. Meraera warned her companions to be silent, and claimed to be prepared with just the spells to keep Astaroth in his slumber.\nMore than other demons, Astaroth had a deep, undying hatred of devils and sought vengeance against them.\nAstaroth had a gift for prophecy.\nThough he ruled no abyssal layer of his own, Astaroth dwelled in a layer filled with steam and floating chunks of burning stone.\nHelanna Darkstorm, a leader of the Knights of the Shield around 1370 DR, may have once been a consort of Astaroth, but by then she certainly was a consort of Gargauth.Powers & Pantheons p. 25 says she \"used to be consort of Astaroth\", but it is unclear if this is the demon prince Astaroth or the archdevil Gargauth using his name. Cloak & Dagger p. 70 establishes Helanna is secretly a demon, Charsultketh, and \"has long been Gargauths consort\". It is unclear if this is a change or correction of the previous information. As the former is a past relationship and the latter is a current relationship, it is possible Charsultketh switched from Astaroth to Gargauth.\nA wielder of pact magic like a binder could summon the vestige of Astaroth and gain powers thereby. His seal had to be drawn on stone that had recently been burned then doused with cold water. He manifested in a cloud of steam from the seal, condensing into the visage of a handsome human with draconic and feather wings, with flicking serpentine tongue. He appeared nervous. His body was forever being slowly consumed by hellfire.\nA binder who bound and made a pact with Astaroth exuded a stink of brimstone and their eyes were covered by a cloudy film. In manner, they became morose and fatalistic, thanks to a vague but unshakeable feeling of impending doom. Astaroth demanded they attack devils whenever the opportunity occurred. In return, Astaroth bestowed several powers. One was to see into the future, as with the divination spell. Another was the ability to pass among fiends of all kinds, with skill in deceit and disguise. The binder could also wound creatures that could only be harmed by silver, like many devils. Finally, they could burn with black Abyssal flame all magical flame they produced turned vile, and the binder could hurl a fireball of this kind thrice a day.\nAfter slaying the demon lord, Gargauth used \"Astaroth\" as an alias for his misdeeds. Gargauth provided the spell Astaroths augmentation to priests of other gods who unwisely called upon him."
