'''Lassandra''' was an agent of the [[Harpers]] who was active throughout the [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
She was a determined individual who remained focused during missions fraught with peril.

==Possessions==
Lassandra wore a suit of [[scale mail]] armor, adorned with a blue skirt, and wielded a [[battleaxe]] when forced to defend herself.

==History==
{{Quote|Keep your torch highâ€”if you step into the shadows, you'll be felled in a heartbeat.|Lassandra}}
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Lassandra led a group of her fellow Harpers, including [[Meygan]] and [[Yonas]], through the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] towards the [[Last Light Inn]]. During their expedition, Yonas was pulled into the darkness by a [[shadow]] and transformed into a [[zombie]]-like husk that scarcely resembled his living self.
