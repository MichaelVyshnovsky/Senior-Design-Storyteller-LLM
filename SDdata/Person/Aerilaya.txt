Aerilaya was a female green elf druid who came to live on Evermeet after wandering Faerûn for some time, spreading the faith of Rillifane Rallathil.
She was tall with long dark hair in a single braid bound with a copper headband engraved with oak leaves.
She came to Evermeet after an "unfortunate incident" involving an oak tree, great quantities of ale, and a Chauntean monk. She eventually grew tired of life on the island, and around 1367 DR she considered returning to Faerûn.
She maintained a close relationship with Carreigh Macumail.
Aerilaya usually wore green druidic robes but in battle she would wear hide armor. She carried a staff of swarming insects, a +1 scimitar, a sling, and an elfrune.
