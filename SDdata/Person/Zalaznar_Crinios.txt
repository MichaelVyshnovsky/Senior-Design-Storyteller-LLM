Zalaznar Crinios was the ruler of Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest in 1370 DR.
Zalaznar was a totally independent leader, not affiliated with the Emerald Enclave. He sometimes disagreed with the Enclaves politics but remained neutral instead, showing dissent without weakening the religion.
In 1391 DR Zalaznar was transformed into a mighty treant for his service to nature, taking hold of the druid circle in Cedarspoke.
