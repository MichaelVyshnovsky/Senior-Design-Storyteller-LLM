'''Zalaznar Crinios''' was the ruler of [[Cedarsproke]] in the [[Gulthmere Forest]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
Zalaznar was a totally independent leader, not affiliated with the [[Emerald Enclave]]. He sometimes disagreed with the Enclave's politics but remained neutral instead, showing dissent without weakening the religion.

==History==
In [[1391 DR]] Zalaznar was transformed into a mighty [[treant]] for his service to nature, taking hold of the druid circle in [[Cedarspoke]].
