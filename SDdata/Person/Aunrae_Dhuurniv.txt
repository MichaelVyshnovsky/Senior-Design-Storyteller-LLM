'''Aunrae Dhuurniv''' was the eldest of the Matron Sisters of [[House Dhuurniv]] involved in the [[Zhent]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]].

==History==
Aunrae was always the most diplomatic and administrative of the Matron sisters. It was Aunrae that first proposed the alliance with the [[Church of Shar]] to survive the fall of [[Maerimydra]] and later with the [[Zhentarim]] in order to reclaim the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]]. In 1375 DR, having achieved her objectives, Aunrae started to organize all the Maerimydra survivors into a great army at her service. Meanwhile she tried to create dissent between the Zhentilar and [[Shar]]rans and even approached the new [[Myth Drannor]] government. The goal of Aunrae was to start a civil war on the surface and use it to conquer all of Shadowdale for the drow, as it was in past centuries.
