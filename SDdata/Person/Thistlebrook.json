        "mainbody": "Thistlebrook was a green warder in Cormanthor in 1373 DR.\nIn 1221 DR, an elfÂ druid ordered Thistlebrook to watch over the ruined tower of Talarith near the Moonsea area. It fulfilled its task well until 1373 DR, when the place was invaded by a drow party led by Varzek. It had no power to destroy them so it lurked around the area, hoping to find some allies to expel them."
