        "mainbody": "Narthel Harlhaun was a member of the Harlhaun merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.\nThe Harlhauns tended to be tall and thin, with high cheekbones and large, dark eyes, and Narthel fit the mold fairly well.\nNarthel was the youngest scion of the Harlhaun family and was in quiet competition with his older brother Lariond for prominence in the family, hoping to become the next leader of the clan. Both brothers chauvinistically wrote off their older sister Arleithe as a contender, which she found insulting. Observing the finer points of etiquette hid their true feelings from everyone, but Narthel attempted to subvert Larionds ambitions and Lariond returned in kind."
