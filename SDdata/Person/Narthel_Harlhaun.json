        "Relationships": "Narthel was the youngest scion of the Harlhaun family and was in quiet competition with his older brother [[Lariond Harlhaun|Lariond]] for prominence in the family, hoping to become the next leader of the clan. Both brothers chauvinistically wrote off their older sister [[Arleithe Harlhaun|Arleithe]] as a contender, which she found insulting. Observing the finer points of etiquette hid their true feelings from everyone, but Narthel attempted to subvert Lariond's ambitions and Lariond returned in kind."
