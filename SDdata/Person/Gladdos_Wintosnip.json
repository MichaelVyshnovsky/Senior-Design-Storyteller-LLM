        "mainbody": "Colonel Gladdos Wintosnip was a high-ranking officer of the Amnian Council Army, circa the .\nGladdos was a forthright and dedicated soldier, and was regarded as one of the best officers in Amn. He was the protégé of General Labak Craumerdaun, who had personally trained him.\nIn 1370 DR, Colonel Wintosnip oversaw one of the most important postings in Amn—the garrison at Keczulla, made up of 100 cavalry and 700 foot soldiers. They provided an extensive road patrol that guarded the length of the Gem Road down to Esmeltaran, and the Eshpurta Road from Amnwater to Axe Bridge, halfway to Eshpurta.\nWintosnip refused to participate in the deal-making and soft corruption that so many officers did, and refused to give the wealthy families and merchants of Esmeltaran special treatment and services with his soldiers. This caused no end of minor political problems for him and some grumbling among his troops, but his posting remained the second-most desired in the Council Army, barely behind Citadel Rashturl under Commander Reyni Delapond. His dedication to his troops and their training also resulted in his infantry becoming highly elite, and the cavalry becoming the outright best unit of horseman in Amn."
