        "mainbody": "privateer\nMahaxara Khal was a human fighter and the Captain of the Royal Guard in service to Prince Andru of the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nShe was tall and athletic of build. Mahaxara kept her head shaved bald but for a queue of long dark hair at the back, while tattoos of snakes covered both her arms, giving her what some considered a barbaric look.\nShe was a reticent warrior and, having no interest in the politics of the royal court, she commonly kept her thoughts to herself.\nVery difficult to take by surprise, Mahaxara had an almost superhuman alertness.\nMahaxara wielded a +3 two-handed sword that she specialized in, but as back-up she also had a +2 short sword and a light crossbow with a half-dozen +3 bolts and three bolts of slaying, two dedicated to illithids and one to beholders. She wore +4 banded mail and a cloak of the bat. Finally, she had a potion of invisibility.\nShe had private quarters in Starhaven, the palace of Prince Andru in the High City of Bral. It was a spartan and spotlessly tidy place.\nShe was a completely loyal to Prince Andru and House Cozar, and was never far from his side.\nMahaxara saw right through Lord Diadan Cartans act as a witty fop and saw him for the vicious murderer he really was. In private, she hated the man and waited for the day she could confront him in a fair fight.\nHailing from some faraway world, Mahaxara Khal traveled on a spelljammer privateer before she arrived on the Rock of Bral. Already an experienced warrior, she enlisted in the Royal Guard and within eight years had risen to its command."
