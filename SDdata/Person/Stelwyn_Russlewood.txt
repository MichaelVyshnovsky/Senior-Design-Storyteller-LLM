Stelwyn Russlewood was a female human cleric of Iyachtu Xvim and an agent of Zhentil Keep based in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR.
In 1369 DR she was a young woman, with midnight-black eyes and hair.
Stelwyn was cruel, domineering, and destructive, and enjoyed bullying those weaker or less fortunate than herself. She was open and forthright in her speech and did not hide her faith in Iyachtu Xvim, but preferred to keep quiet her affiliation to Zhentil Keep.
In addition to commanding the prayers of a cleric, Stelwyn was an authlim, a specialty priest of Xvim. As such, she was immune to fear spells but could surround herself with an aura of fear once a day. She could also conjure an aura of protection from good and freely call upon Xvim to heal her wounds, once each a day.
Stelwyn swung a +3 footmans mace in a fight, enhanced by a girdle of hill giant strength. To keep herself alive, she wore bracers of defense, a +2 cloak of protection, a ring of free action, and a +3 ring of protection. She carried a holy symbol of her god Xvim, and typically had six vials of unholy water. She got around on a light warhorse.
