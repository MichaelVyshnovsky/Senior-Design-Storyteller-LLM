Amath Sercent () was a priestess of Bane in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR.
Amath went to pray to her god with her acolytes in an abandoned tower in the Castle Ward that she was converting to a temple to Bane. Amath worked in Manshoons takeover of the city by trying to gain control of the broadsheet publishers of Waterdeep.
In 1492 DR, Amath was busy with her project to forcibly convert publishers to Banes worship and her target was Shan Chien.
If Manshoon managed to obtain the Stone of Golorr, thanks to the actions of her companion Agorn Fuoco, Amath was ordered to protect the Stone. She kept custody of the Stone while waiting for the arrival of Manshoon.
Amath was an ally of Manshoons Zhentarim.
