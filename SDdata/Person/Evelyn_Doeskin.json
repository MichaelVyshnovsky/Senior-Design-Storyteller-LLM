        "mainbody": "Evelyn Doeskin was a druidess of Mielikki in northeast Faer√ªn around the late 14 century DR.\nEvelyn was capable of casting the spells barkskin, charm person or mammal, cure light wounds, entangle, faerie fire, goodberry, invisibility to animals, speak with animals, and summon insects.\nEvelyn wore a suit of leather armor and carried around a wooden +1 shield. In terms of weaponry, she carried a scimitar and a sling with lead bullets.\nAt some point in the 14 century DR, Evelyn was instructed by Mielikkian superiors to wander through the swampy forests of Vaasa in order to learn whatever she could about the Cult of the Dragons activity there. Over the first two days, the only things she managed to occasionally encounter were boars, snakes, and trolls."
