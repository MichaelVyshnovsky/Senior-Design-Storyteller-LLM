Jolthur Jathlet was the patriarch of the Jathlet merchant family in Delzimmer until his demise circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR. He had a long reign as head of the family and was still in his prime when a suspicious riding accident took his life. He was succeeded by his widow, Elsraea, but she did not have much influence over Jolthurs many brother and uncles, some of whom were powerful mages, and she became mainly a figurehead in a male-dominated clan. Jolthur was the father of Dolrur, one of many sons and nephews that were also trying to make a name for themselves in Delzimmer and elsewhere.
