'''Vyqinak''' was an [[ixitxachitl]] [[vampire]]<ref group="note">A "vampiric ixitxachitl" was not the same as an ixitxachitl vampire. While both had the ''[[energy drain]]'' ability and some other shared traits, the former was not [[undead]]. See ''[[Monster Manual II]]'', page 129. known as the Count of the Depths in the court of the [[Night King]] in [[Westgate]] as of the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].

==Activities==
As Count of the Depths, Vyqinak was the junior [[Night Master]] in charge of all smuggling in the Westgate harbor. He was also responsible for reports on shipping activity on the [[Dragon Coast]]. He was tasked by the Night King to seek out the wreck of the ''[[Sapphire of Enki]]'', an [[Untheric]] sailing vessel believed to have been carrying a powerful magic tome titled ''[[Songs of Sea Serpents]]'', written by [[Nezram the World-Walker|Nezram]] "Worldwalker". Vyqinak concentrated his search on the area between Westgate and [[Sembia]], a sea bed covered in thick silt known as the [[Haunted Plains]].

==Relationships==
Vyqinak answered to the Duke of Shadows, [[Tebryn Dhialael]], whose portfolio included all smuggling and thieving activity perpetrated by the [[Night Masks]]. In turn, Vyqinak's servants included a pack of lesser [[seawolf|seawolves]] that worked on the docks and as hands on ships that regularly returned to Westgate.

Vyqinak recruited [[Hrarnok Sharkchum]] as an assassin after discovering he was a seawolf whose shapechanging ability made an excellent cover.

==History==
Vyqinak was originally a mid-level priest (known as a vitan) of [[Ilxendren]], living in the [[Xedran Reefs]], until the start of the [[Twelfth Ser√¥s War]] in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]]. He fled the conflict in shame, abandoning his people and his faith to take up the worship of [[Demogorgon]], an ancient deity of ixitxachitls that predated Ilxendren. He was drawn to the harbor of Westgate in [[1370 DR]] where he encountered [[Orlak II]] (a.k.a. Orbakh, a [[Manshoon]] clone turned undead), the Night King, who turned him into a vampire (which was a very high status in ixitxachitl culture) and installed him as a Count in the Court.
