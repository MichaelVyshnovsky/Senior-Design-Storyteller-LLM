        "mainbody": "'''Sholsarrath the Lame''' was a dim-witted [[kobold]] [[warlock]] of the [[Skulking Dragon]] clan who traded his own head to a [[demon]], actually just an [[imp]], [[Yargulbuzul]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "After entering his pact, Sholsarrath was missing a finger and a foot.",
        "History": "Sholsarrath was a kobold [[shaman]] who, in order to avoid a grisly death, entered a warlock's pact with the demon Yargulbuzul, who offered him power and, subsequently, the leadership of the clan. The price was the kobold's own finger and a foot. After the said fiasco, Sholsarrath the Lame committed to taking care of his tribe and keeping it happy and well-fed – for a kobold, that meant raiding local farms. With help from the tribe's old chief, Sholsarrath trained the kobold warriors to be a fearsome force. Soon after the plunder began, the Skulking Dragons became hated and feared among the locals. The clan's infamy rose so much that a band of traveling [[adventurer]]s decided to end the kobold menace.\n\nThe five adventurers rode out of the village of [[Houndstown]] and quickly were able to track the Skulking Dragon clan. The kobolds might have been a nightmare for the local peasantry, but they were naught but pests for weathered adventures, who slaughtered the clan's best warriors en masse. Desperate once again to escape sure doom, Sholsarrath the Lame evoked Yargulbuzul's name once again, demanding salvation and a way to escape. Yargulbuzul claimed that it would be a tough feat to accomplish and demanded one last payment from the kobold, a payment greater than anything he paid before. The dim-witted warlock agreed frantically to Yargulbuzul's demands – the kobold's head. When the five adventurers reached the shaman's lair, they witnessed a happy imp decapitating Sholsarrath and carrying his soul to the [[Abyss]].\n\nSometime later, Sholsarrath the Lame's head was fashioned into an [[enchanted]] mask fashioned to be worn by warlocks. The ''[[Head of the Lame Kobold]]'' found its way into the hands of [[Dayne Lynneth]], a merchant from [[Tyr's Eye]] plaza in the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
