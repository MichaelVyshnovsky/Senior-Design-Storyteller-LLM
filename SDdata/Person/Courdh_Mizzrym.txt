'''Courdh Mizzrym''' was the Archmage Emeritus of [[Menzoberranzan]] and house wizard of the [[House Mizzrym]] in [[1370 DR]].

Courdh was the aged Past Master who oversaw all teaching at the Academy. He was in charge of experimenting with and guarding the most powerful magical items held by [[Sorcere]]. He was also secretly Sorcere's overseer of security, and hence the spymaster in charge of watching the noble houses.
