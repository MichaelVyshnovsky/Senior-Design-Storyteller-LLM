'''Thoround''' was an [[alchemist]] of the city of [[Nimpeth]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}

==History==
Following an outbreak of a [[Unidentified disease (Vilhon Reach)|heretofore unknown disease]] in the Vilhon Reach in the late 1350s DR, Thoround reported a use for the bodily fluids, that is, the spittle or blood, of [[human]]s affected by the disease. Thoround claimed if the fluid was used in the making of [[ink]] for writing a ''[[forget]]'' spell, then the process could be made simpler and cheaper. Moreover, if the fluid was used in the ink for any spell, then the spell would disappear from the page upon casting from a [[spellbook]] in the normal manner—but would spontaneously reappear between 3 and 12 days later, provided the page remained intact.
