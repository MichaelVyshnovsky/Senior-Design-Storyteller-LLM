'''Pharaulee''' was an innkeeper in [[Scornubel]].

==Abilities==
She apparently had the ability to cast her sight from other people's faces, in the process displaying the face of an old woman on top of theirs.

==Description==
The old woman's face that peered out of the faces of other people when she looked through them may have been her own. If so, she had old, sad eyes, and a lushly beautiful face, large and gray-haired.

==Relationships==
Pharaulee was usually contacted through [[Rildra]], and protected by [[Ulburt]]. After Rildra's death, she was contacted directly, at least to [[Marlel]].

==Activities==
She was the innkeeper at [[the Stormy Tankard]] in [[Scornubel]], charging three [[silver piece]]s per night.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|58|4}} She was almost certainly a [[Harper]].

==History==
Pharaulee was a contact for Marlel when he brought [[Shandril Shessair]] and [[Narm Tamaraith]] to the [[Stormy Tankard]]. He meant to talk through Rildra, but had to deal with Pharaulee directly instead, as Rildra had recently perished. She was also the innkeeper at the Tankard.
