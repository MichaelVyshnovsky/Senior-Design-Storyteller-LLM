Pharaulee was an innkeeper in Scornubel.
She apparently had the ability to cast her sight from other peoples faces, in the process displaying the face of an old woman on top of theirs.
The old womans face that peered out of the faces of other people when she looked through them may have been her own. If so, she had old, sad eyes, and a lushly beautiful face, large and gray-haired.
Pharaulee was usually contacted through Rildra, and protected by Ulburt. After Rildras death, she was contacted directly, at least to Marlel.
She was the innkeeper at the Stormy Tankard in Scornubel, charging three silver pieces per night. She was almost certainly a Harper.
Pharaulee was a contact for Marlel when he brought Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith to the Stormy Tankard. He meant to talk through Rildra, but had to deal with Pharaulee directly instead, as Rildra had recently perished. She was also the innkeeper at the Tankard.
