        "mainbody": "Goodwife '''Aruna''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] who settled in the hamlet of [[West Harbor]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "The healer was an older [[human]] woman. Aruna wore her graying hair in a tight bun. Her clothes were simple [[robe]]s.",
        "Personality": "Goodwife Aruna was a calm and kindly woman. She had a caring and pleasant personality, and her facial expression advertised respect and understanding.",
        "Possessions": "Aruna was armed with an [[enchanted]] weaponâ€”a ''[[Gardener's Spade]]''. Her most prized possession was a hand-woven [[shawl]], which Aruna lost while fleeing [[Wanderfen]]. Goodwife's shawl emanated a strangely comforting aura of mystery and holiness.",
        "History": "Goodwife Aruna hailed from the hamlet of Wanderfen in the Mere of Dead Men. When it started being reclaimed by the swamp, the woman left the village and relocated to a settlement north of Wanderfen called West Harbor. She was thankful to the villagers who welcomed her with open arms, and she gladly paid them back with her healing magics and skills in medicine. She often welcomed visitors to the village, offering them blessings of Chauntea and healing at no charge. Given opportunity, Aruna was willing to give up her enchanted [[staff]] in exchange for a brave adventurer returning the Goodwife's lost shawl. She claimed that a gang of [[lizardfolk]] picked up the shawl Aruna dropped while fleeing her previous home."
