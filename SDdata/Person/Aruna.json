        "mainbody": "oodwife Aruna was a cleric of Chauntea who settled in the hamlet of West Harbor in the Mere of Dead Men circa 1374 DR.\nThe healer was an older human woman. Aruna wore her graying hair in a tight bun. Her clothes were simple robes.\nGoodwife Aruna was a calm and kindly woman. She had a caring and pleasant personality, and her facial expression advertised respect and understanding.\nAruna was armed with an enchanted weaponâ€”a Gardeners Spade. Her most prized possession was a hand-woven shawl, which Aruna lost while fleeing Wanderfen. Goodwifes shawl emanated a strangely comforting aura of mystery and holiness.\nGoodwife Aruna hailed from the hamlet of Wanderfen in the Mere of Dead Men. When it started being reclaimed by the swamp, the woman left the village and relocated to a settlement north of Wanderfen called West Harbor. She was thankful to the villagers who welcomed her with open arms, and she gladly paid them back with her healing magics and skills in medicine. She often welcomed visitors to the village, offering them blessings of Chauntea and healing at no charge. Given opportunity, Aruna was willing to give up her enchanted staff in exchange for a brave adventurer returning the Goodwifes lost shawl. She claimed that a gang of lizardfolk picked up the shawl Aruna dropped while fleeing her previous home."
