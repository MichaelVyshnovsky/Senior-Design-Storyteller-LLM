'''Rayad al-Farif''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] inhabitant of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|59}}

==Activities==
Rayad owned a small shop called "Appointments with the Mighty" where he claimed to be able to arrange meetings between his customers and various elite members of Huzuz's society, including the leaders of the great mosques and even the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]]. He only charged his customers if he was able to make an appointment.

For appointments with the Grand Caliph Rayad usually just scheduled his clients to appear at the Grand Caliph's next public audience.

==Relationships==
Rayad had a falling out with [[Renn min Zann]] many years ago, and did everything he coudl to avoid him.
