        "mainbody": "'''Quessahn Uthraebor''' is a [[warlock]] living in [[Waterdeep]]. Hundreds of years ago, she lived in the [[High Forest]] and was married to a [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] named [[Jinnaoth Ir'Gadohn]] but he was killed soon after their marriage. Quess studied at the [[House of Wonder]] in Waterdeep and also received tutelage from the [[Avolakia]] [[Briarbones]]. Many years later, she chanced upon a newer incarnation of Jinnaoth and they became friends although Jinnaoth didn't remember that they were married in one of his past lives. Quessahn helped Jinnaoth stop the ritual of the [[First Flensing]] which would have allowed the [[evil]] [[deity]] [[Asmodeus]] to enter Waterdeep.",
