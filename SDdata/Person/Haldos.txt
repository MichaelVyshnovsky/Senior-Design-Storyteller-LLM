'''Haldos''' was a man of the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was a [[butcher]] and owner of [[Haldos's Fine Butchery]].

Around [[1369 DR]], Haldos kept his business in the center of Wheloon, to the irritation of his neighbors, though few dared to complain to him about the noise of slaughter. He was a very big man, with a spade-shaped beard.

He was one of the few butchers who could slaughter a beast on the spot and provide the freshest possible meat.
