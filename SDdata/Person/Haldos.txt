Haldos was a man of the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. He was a butcher and owner of Haldoss Fine Butchery.
Around 1369 DR, Haldos kept his business in the center of Wheloon, to the irritation of his neighbors, though few dared to complain to him about the noise of slaughter. He was a very big man, with a spade-shaped beard.
He was one of the few butchers who could slaughter a beast on the spot and provide the freshest possible meat.
