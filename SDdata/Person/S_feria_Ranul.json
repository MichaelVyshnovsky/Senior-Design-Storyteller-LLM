        "mainbody": "'''S'feria Ranul''' was a [[drow]] [[elf]] [[Silverstar]] of [[Selûne]] and the leader of the [[Sisters of the Blood Moon]], who resided in the city of [[Silverymoon]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "The drow priestess was a charismatic woman and a talented leader, diplomat, and tactician.",
        "Equipment": "S'feria's weapons of choice were her [[mace]] and trusted [[shield]].",
        "History": "She was born in the [[Underdark]] city of [[Sshamath]] but was raised by [[moon elves]] within the surface city of Silverymoon. By the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, S'feria was a deeply devoted follower of [[Selûne]], goddess of the moon, and became a specialty priest of the [[Church of Selûne]] – a [[Silverstar]]. The young drow woman dedicated herself to adventuring and spreading the good word of her deity,  helping those in need, abused, and oppressed.\n\nBy chance, or by Selûne's caring guidance, S'feria came across [[Oagla'ta]], a massive [[half-orcish]] woman, and her beloved [[gray dwarf]] [[Nyzeil Nighthammer]]. Despite Silverymoon being a bastion of tolerance and understanding, the city guards still were known to harbor prejudice. The goodly couple became costed by bigoted guardsmen, and S'feria could not help but intervene. This act of kindness gained her two steadfast and loyal friends and forged the first members of what later became the [[Sisters of the Blood Moon]].\n\nSometime later, the newly formed Sisters were ambushed by a band of [[goblin]]s while traveling the northern roads. Another chance encounter followed. A [[half-elven]] [[ranger]] [[Nevae Quar]], and her [[rock gnome]] sisters [[Hylei Shadowhand]] and [[Kylei Shadowhand]] joined the battle seeing fellow adventurers in peril. The woman realized that they fought together as one, bravely and naturally. They decided to join together to serve the cause of goodness.\n\nIn 1310 DR, S'feria Ranul received a letter – a plea for help from the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Despite the promise of [[gold]] and fame, S'feria led her Sisters to the northern city, answering its pleas for help."
