        "mainbody": "Florozta, who more commonly went by Rozta, was a traveling guardswoman that offered her services throughout the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nShe was a tall and broad-shouldered woman, with unruly blonde hair that was kept short, cut just above her ears.\nShe was a simple, down-to-earth woman with a strong sense for people. While she recognized the usefulness of magic for people in her walk of life, she did not concern herself much with such complexities. Interestingly enough, Rozta was familiar with and regularly exclaimed to the overdeity Ao, the being whose presence was only briefly revealed to the Realms during the Time of Troubles.\nWhile she had strong maternal instincts and was naturally protective of others, While she usually had no problem expressing her anger, Rozta would avoid conflict when she experienced true emotionally pain. In the instances she felt truly betrayed, she would rather shun the person than confront them directly about the matter.\nIn addition to her fighting prowess, Rozta knew a number of home remedies that helped ease the rigors of life on the road. She would seep Wyndors herbs for her companions when needed, making a tea that would nearly immobilize a person, but also help them heal from injury.\nRoztz preferred to wear leather armor during her travels and armed herself with her trusted sword. She did also keep a number of knives strapped to her person as well.\nThe stalwart warrior served as her familys protector during journeys across the Heartlands.\nRozta became infatuated with her traveling companion Druhallen shortly after their meeting, while she simultaneously gained the affections of his foster brother and dearest friend Galimer. While she and Dru enjoyed a relationship for a year or two, along with a year-long engagement that was more-or-less endured, the mage did not love Rozta as she did him. Despite this messy history and hard years together on the road, Rozta still very much loved her husband Galimer.\nWhile traveling with her family earning a living in the Western Heartlands, Rozta very much played the role of mother to the young lad Tiep. She absolutely adored the boy, in his heart Tiep felt that she was the closest thing he had to a mother.\nSome time around ,This event is stated to occur a few years after 1353 DR. Rozta began working as a bodyguard for a Zhentilar captain in Triel, but was forced to turn away his advances one too many times. She left the city east along the Dusk Road where she met two traveling wizards, Druhallen and Galimer, and offered them her services as their protector.\nWhile Galimer lined up work the following year, Roztas ongoing recovery left them with few prospects. When Druhallen returned to his freinds after his elopement, he was welcomed back with open arms, and the trio set out on the road once again. While the road to the mines were closed down just the year before, they were given new opportunity by the goblin named Sheemzher, a particularly intelligent and well-mannered creature that beckoned them to Weathercote Wood in order to meet his mistress, Lady Wyndyfarh.\nDuring the journey through the woods, Tiep broke away from his parents, stole bits of amber from the trees along a path to the Ladys glade, and carelessly killed some of her awakened insect servants. When they appeared at an audience before the mysterious and powerful Lady Wyndyfarh, she accused Tiep of the crimes he had just recently committed, and Galimer challenged her authority on the matter. In the blink of an eye, Wyndyfarh teleported Galimer away, and presented Rozta and Dru with an offer travel to the old mines of Dekanter and recover one of the lost Nether Scrolls, and Galimer would be returned unharmed. \nThe group braved the perils of the Greypeak Mountains together, traveling across fetid bogs and along treacherous mountainside paths draw upon inner strength of which they may not have been aware, and sacrifice of themselves for their fellow companions. They managed to recover the Nether Scroll, distract the monstrous ruler of Dekanter known as the Beast Lord, and flee the mines with their lives.\nDuring their journey back to Weathercote Wood, Tiep revealed to Rozta that he had been working with Amarandaris in the past as well as the debt he owed Lord Sememmon of Darkhold. Rozta shut a part of herself down emotionally, and would not even acknowledge Tieps existence. She offered Druhallen an ultimatum, Tiep would leave before they recovered Galimer or she would. Dru came up with a plan to help Tiep from fully succumbing to the Zhentarims influence, and they were all able to reunite with Galimer altogether. Rozta did not immediately share with Galimer Tieps betrayal, and Dru did all he could to ensure they had the best possible chance to remain a united family in the face of all they had encountered."
