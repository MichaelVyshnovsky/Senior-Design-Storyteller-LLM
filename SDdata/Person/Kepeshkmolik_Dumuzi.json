In his youth, he was also part of the Liberators of the Steel Sky, although he didnt agree with their beliefs, and retired prior to 1486 DR.\nIn 1486 DR, Dumuzi was sent by Clan Verthisathurgiesh to find Mehen and convince him to return to Djerad Thymar. During his time traveling, Dumuzi helped the Cormyrian guard during the siege of Suzail.\nWhen he returned to Djerad Thymar, be began to have strange dreams about a bearded warrior who talked to him in a language Dumuzi couldnt understand. On Nightal 26, that warrior was revealed to be the god Enlil, who gave Dumuzi the power to destroy a maurezhi servant of the God-king Gilgeam, who was sent to Djerad Thymar to debilitate the citys defenses ahead of the return of Unther to Toril. When the magic of the Second Sundering was about to return Tymanther to Abeir, Dumuzi became the Chosen of Enlil, enabling the god to stop the process and allow most of Tymanther to remain on Toril.\nAfterwards, Dumuzi began to proselytize Enlils faith in Tymanther, which damaged his mothers position in Thymari society. \nDuring the first Tymanther-Unther War, Dumuzi convinced Enlil to allow Asmodeus to get Nanna-Sins divine spark in exchange for the Archdevil to bring back the dead god to the life as an immortal being."
