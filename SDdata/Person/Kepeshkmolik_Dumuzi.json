        "Relationships": "Dumuzi was the son of [[Verthisathurgiesh Arjhani]] and [[Kepeshkmolik Uadjit]].",
        "History": "Dumuzi was originally a member of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]]. In his youth, he was also part of the [[Liberators of the Steel Sky]], although he didn't agree with their beliefs, and retired prior to [[1486 DR]].\n\nIn 1486 DR, Dumuzi was sent by Clan Verthisathurgiesh to find [[Mehen]] and convince him to return to [[Djerad Thymar]]. During his time traveling, Dumuzi helped the [[Cormyr]]ian guard during the siege of [[Suzail]].\n\nWhen he returned to Djerad Thymar, be began to have strange dreams about a bearded warrior who talked to him in a language Dumuzi couldn't understand. On [[Nightal 26]], that warrior was revealed to be the god Enlil, who gave Dumuzi the power to destroy a [[maurezhi]] servant of the [[deity|God]]-king [[Gilgeam]], who was sent to Djerad Thymar to debilitate the city's defenses ahead of the return of [[Unther]] to [[Toril]]. When the magic of the [[Second Sundering]] was about to return [[Tymanther]] to [[Abeir]], Dumuzi became the Chosen of Enlil, enabling the god to stop the process and allow most of Tymanther to remain on Toril.\n\nAfterwards, Dumuzi began to proselytize Enlil's faith in Tymanther, which damaged his mother's position in [[Thymari]] society. \n\nDuring the [[first Tymanther-Unther War]], Dumuzi convinced Enlil to allow [[Asmodeus]] to get [[Nanna-Sin]]'s divine spark in exchange for the [[Archdevil]] to bring back the dead god to the life as an immortal being."
