Mostok was a barbarian of the Astok hill tribe and an inhabitant of the Free City of Umara in north Zakhara in .
Mostok was a faithful supporter of Khan Ubar khel Muhif and followed him to Umara when Ubar became Caliph of that city after the rebellion. As Ubars second-in-command he was referred to as "ur-Khan Mostok." Mostok believed that life in Umara was making Ubar soft and he never referred to him as Caliph. He distrusted the natives of Umara and believed they would one day turn on the members of the Astok who lived within the city.
