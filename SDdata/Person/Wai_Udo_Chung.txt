'''Wai Udo Chung''' was a member of the [[Wai Clan]] of [[T'u Lung]] around the {{YearlinkConvert|2310|SY}}, as well as a cousin to the nation's then-emperor,<ref group="note" name="clarification">It is not stated on page 45 of ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' exactly which emperor Wai Udo Chung is a cousin of, but the timeline suggests it would have to be Shin Gisen during this time. The most likely explanation is that they are related through the marriage of Gisen's eldest daughter, [[Shin Do]], to [[Wai Long Hwa]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2356|SY}}. That marriage was done in order strengthen the bonds between Emperor Shin Gisen and the Wai Clan, which wouldn't have been necessary if they already had familial relations prior.

==History==
Chung lived in a mansion in the great T'u Lung city of [[Balanzia]], a century prior to its destruction.
