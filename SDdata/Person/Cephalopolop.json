        "mainbody": "The '''Cephalopolop''' was a renegade [[kraken]] who was the secret ruler of [[Sloopdilmonpolop]] in [[1370 DR]]. and [[1372 DR]]",
        "Personality": "Despite its small size as a kraken, the Cephalopolop compensated with cunning, secrecy and ambition.",
        "History": "The Cephalopolop was a kraken from the seas of the surface until it arrived in Sloopdilmonpolop, where in time it assumed secret control of the [[kuo-toa]].\n\nFor a long time, Cephalopolop plotted against a kraken that ruled the seas off the coasts of [[Calimshan]]. In [[1363 DR]], the Cephalopolop's plans were weakened when, in the [[Nelanther Isles]], a third kraken killed and replaced the [[dragon turtle]] known as the [[Curse of Irphong]]. Now with two potential rivals, the Cephalopolop became more cautious.\n\nBy 1370 DR, its puppet was the Priest-King [[Dagagoorg]], who believed the Cephalopolop was an incarnation of [[Blibdoolpoolp]]."
