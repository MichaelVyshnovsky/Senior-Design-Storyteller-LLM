'''Ellison Berenger''' was a [[sorcerer]] member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and a scribe of [[Mantor's Library]] in [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]].
 
==History==
Ellison was sent by his masters to infiltrate Mantor's Library, together with fellow cultists [[Tibeem]] and [[Spernik]], who had another mission. Ellison's mission was to recover lore about the [[Pool of Radiance (disambiguation)|Pool of Radiance]] under [[Valjevo Castle]]. He finally identified three books of interest and stole them from their owners. However, in escaping Phlan, he suffered so many injuries that he came close to death.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|5}}

After he escaped from Phlan, he met with the [[black dragon]] [[wyrmling]] [[Rythnax]] in his lair. However, they were confronted by an adventuring party hired to recover the stolen books. In the fighting, Ellison was captured.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|21-22}}

After [[Vorgansharax]]'s coup, Ellison severed his ties with the Cult of Dragon and tried to find a way to escape the city.

==Personality==
Ellison believed himself to be a descendant of one of Phlan's noble houses and for this reason accepted the mission to Mantor's Library so he could research this.

He despised Rythnax.

Ellison was an intelligent and arrogant individual but not evil. He focused only on himself but still had a sense of honor and a good memory.
