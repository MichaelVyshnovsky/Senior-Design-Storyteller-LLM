Ellison Berenger was a sorcerer member of the Cult of the Dragon and a scribe of Mantors Library in Phlan in 1489 DR.
Ellison was sent by his masters to infiltrate Mantors Library, together with fellow cultists Tibeem and Spernik, who had another mission. Ellisons mission was to recover lore about the Pool of Radiance under Valjevo Castle. He finally identified three books of interest and stole them from their owners. However, in escaping Phlan, he suffered so many injuries that he came close to death.
After he escaped from Phlan, he met with the black dragon wyrmling Rythnax in his lair. However, they were confronted by an adventuring party hired to recover the stolen books. In the fighting, Ellison was captured.
After Vorgansharaxs coup, Ellison severed his ties with the Cult of Dragon and tried to find a way to escape the city.
Ellison believed himself to be a descendant of one of Phlans noble houses and for this reason accepted the mission to Mantors Library so he could research this.
He despised Rythnax.
Ellison was an intelligent and arrogant individual but not evil. He focused only on himself but still had a sense of honor and a good memory.
