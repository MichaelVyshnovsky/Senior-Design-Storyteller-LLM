'''Izu''' was a blind master smith from the [[Silver Marches]] who worked for the [[Harpers]] until his dying breath, sometime before [[1373 DR]].

==History==
After spending years forging [[enchanted]] weapons and armor for his Harper allies, Izu died after a brutal winter that ravaged the region. Only after his death was the smith's affiliation with the Harpers discovered by his family. The smith's heirs gifted his prized possession – ''[[Izu's hammer of fabrication]]'', to a young [[Harper agent]] Izu was especially fond of.
