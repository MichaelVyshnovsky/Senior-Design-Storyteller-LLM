Sprite-Heels was Lord of the Watch of Ankhapur
Sprite-Heels loved ale and cheese, and he liked his comforts. He was a very good gambler. However, Sprite-Heels often spoke before thinking, being an impulsive individual. Because of this, he often sniped at and insulted all members of the gang.
Sprite-Heels was one of the thief companions of Pinch in Elturel. He followed his boss back to Ankhapur to regain his body. However, he was blinded by the lich Manferic III.
Once Pinch became King Janol I, he appointed Sprite-Heels as Lord Buckweather.
