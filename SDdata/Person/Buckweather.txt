'''Sprite-Heels''' was Lord of the Watch of [[Ankhapur]]

==Personality==
Sprite-Heels loved ale and cheese, and he liked his comforts. He was a very good gambler. However, Sprite-Heels often spoke before thinking, being an impulsive individual. Because of this, he often sniped at and insulted all members of the gang.

==History==
Sprite-Heels was one of the thief companions of Pinch in [[Elturel]]. He followed his boss back to [[Ankhapur]] to regain his body. However, he was blinded by the [[lich]] [[Manferic III]].

Once Pinch became King Janol I, he appointed Sprite-Heels as Lord Buckweather.
