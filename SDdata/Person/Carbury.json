        "mainbody": "'''Carbury''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and prolific [[spell]] inventor who specialized in the school of [[illusion]], particularly with [[phantasm]]s.",
        "Personality": "Despite his ingenuity, Carbury was thoroughly [[chaotic]], fierce, and [[evil]].",
        "History": "The evil [[inventor]] was born in [[Spiel]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2896|NY}}. He took full advantage of the enclave's universities, and became a proficient arcanist who took a great interest in illusion [[magic]]. The chaotic Carbury did not pass quietly. In {{YearlinkConvert|3018|NY}}, he attempted to overtake the entire conclave of Spiel in order to usurp its [[archwizard]]'s power. In order to achieve this, he created several illusions to make others believe he was the legendary [[sarrukh]] lord, the [[Terraseer]]. However, Carbury was found out by an adventuring group, and he was summarily executed."
