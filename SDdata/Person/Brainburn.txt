'''Brainburn''' was a [[flameskull]] member of the [[Twisted Rune]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==History==
In 1375 DR, his masters sent Brainburn and his [[Brainburn's Legion|legion]], composed of [[baneguard]] and [[dread]], to investigate the message a dying [[Halaster Blackcloak]] had sent to adventurers. Brainburn's strategy was to capture all the adventurers called and use a ''[[detect thoughts]]'' spell on them.
