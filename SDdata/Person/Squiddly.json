        "mainbody": "Squiddly was a street urchin from Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nSquiddly had a slender build. He had red skin, a long tail, and the horns common of tieflings. His left eye was covered by a black eye patch.\nHe was impulsive, rarely thinking before acting.\nSquiddly wore an eye patch and carried a small bow and a quiver with a handful of toy arrows.\nthumb|right|A closeup of Squiddlys likeness.\nSquiddly was part of the group of street urchins that included his friends Nat and Jenks. He communicated with the deaf Nat using a sign language Nat had invented.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Squiddly and his friends were unwittingly entangled in the city-wide hunt for the Stone of Golorr, sometimes innocently helping or hindering the efforts of adventurers in retrieving it."
