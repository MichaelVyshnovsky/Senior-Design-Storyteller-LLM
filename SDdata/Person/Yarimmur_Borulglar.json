        "mainbody": "'''Yarimmur Borulglar''' was a brewmaster and part owner of the [[Moon Mountain Brewery]] on the [[Unicorn Run]] in [[northwest Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].",
        "Personality": "Yarimmur believed in hard work, especially if it brought in revenue. Because of this, the brewery produced excellent product, but things like building expansion and repairs were done quickly and with little planning.{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80}}",
        "Abilities": "He was a skilled brewmaster with knowledge about all aspects of the trade, from growing the crops to shipping the finished product to customers. He also knew how to brew two [[poison]]s that could be mixed with alcohol, [[bittermint]] and [[tulade]], from natural ingredients found in the vicinity of the brewery.",
        "Activities": "Yarimmur was one of three staff members that knew about doing smuggling for the [[Black Network]]. This tight cabal of leaders shipped coded messages and/or small items in hidden compartments inside kegs and casks of their product. The communications and contraband primarily came from [[Tarth Brallowgath]], a [[human]] trader and Zhentarim agent that did legitimate business with the brewery as well. Very rarely, Brallowgath ordered a particular barrel to be poisoned. Yarimmur hated to comply with such orders, but could not afford to lose the protection and business from the Zhents.",
        "Relationships": "Yarimmur was co-owner of the brewery along with [[Nurvala Minstrelwish]]. Most of the halflings residing at Moon Mountain felt that something unusual was going on between Brallowgath and the leadership, but thought it was better not to know the details."
