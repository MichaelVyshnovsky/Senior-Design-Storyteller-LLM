Chathi Oandem was a priestess of Kossuth.
Chathi was of willowy built. She had hazel eyes. Old burn scars marred her left cheek and her body but didnt blemish her otherwise handsome appearance. Chathi had an air of energy and quick intelligence around her.
During warfare, Chathi usually wore mail and helmet. Otherwise she liked to wear flame-patterend vestments.
Chathi was trained to fight her enemies with mundane weapons as well as her potent magic.
She had also healing spells in her repertoire.
Chathi took part in the war against an undead army invading Pyarados. There she met Aoth Fezim who later became her lover. During the fight at the Keep of Thazar she was killed by an exploding wand in her hand - a rod supplied by Szass Tam and his way of obliterating members of the church of Kossuth and his adversaries.
