        "mainbody": "'''Uraerik Thaurongol''' was a [[dwarven]] crafter and smith who lived and worked in [[Everlund]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Uraerik was the creator of an ornate, life-sized [[dragon]] head that was purchased by the proprietors of the [[Wyrmworks]] in [[Silverymoon]] to display in their shop when the main attraction, [[Old Roaring Rage]], was rented out. The stand-in was made from [[electrum]] and was a whimsical representation of an unknown type of dragon. It was not for sale, but miniature versions of it rendered in metal by \"lesser\" dwarven smiths of Silverymoon sold for 200 to 400 [[gold piece]]s.{{Cite dragon/322/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Wyrmworks|84}}"
