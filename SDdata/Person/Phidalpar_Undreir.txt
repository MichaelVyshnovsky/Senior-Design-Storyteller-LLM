Phidalpar Undreir was an opportunistic merchant and fence who owned Undreir Facilitations in Tilverton in the mid-14 century DR.
Phidalpar was a fat man.
Phadalpar was greedy and unscrupulous, taking any opportunity to enrich himself.
Phidalpars shrewd business dealings made him very wealthy in Tilverton, but he was not associated with the Rogues of Tilverton. He protected himself and his assets with over a dozen hired guards who were always nearby, armed with daggers and darts coated with sleep poison. He often dealt with adventurers either by hiring them for an odd job or by serving as a fence for illicit items.
