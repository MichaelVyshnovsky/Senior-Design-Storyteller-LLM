'''Vhissilka''' was a [[marilith]] commander serving the [[balor]] lord [[Axithar]].

==Description==
Vhissilka wore her hair in dull gray-brown braids. She wore a bronze [[cuirass]] and wielded two [[scimitar]]s.

==History==
Vhissilka was a [[demon]] commander who claimed to have once been in command of 10,000 soldiers. In [[1385 DR]], she and her minions were engaged in the [[Blood War]] against [[devil]]s in the [[Blood Rift]]. When [[Mystra]] was killed and the [[multiverse]] went awry, a "chunk" of the Blood Rift was ripped away from the main plane, trapping Vhissilka and soldiers from both sides. After [[Tauran]], [[Aliisza]], [[Kael]], [[Kaanyr Vhok]], and [[Zasian Menz]] accidentally arrived in that remnant, Vhok abandoned them and joined up with Vhissilka. Vhok and Vhissilka escaped and returned to the balor Axithar, who invaded the [[House of the Triad]] with the intelligence provided by Vhok.
