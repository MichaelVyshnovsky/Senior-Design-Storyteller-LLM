        "mainbody": "'''Daazlag''' was an [[orog]] in the [[Thar]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Around [[1369 DR]], Daazlag, alongside his siblings [[Naazlog]] and his leader [[Thrull]], emerged from the [[Underdark]] to the [[Xûl-Jarak]] citadel in [[Thar]]. There, the [[orc]] adept [[Jurrg]] proclaimed them \"sons of [[Gruumsh]]\" and Thrull the new king of Thar. Quickly, Thrull ordered Naazlog and Daazlag to act as his lieutenants.\n\nIn 1374 DR, [[Rûlgar]], Jurrg's brother, found the [[Hammer of Gruumsh]] in a cave in the [[Galena Mountains]] and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrull's rule was near.\n\nMeanwile, Daazlag had secretly formed an alliance with [[Bremen Leiyraghon]], heir of [[House Leiyraghon]] in [[Melvaunt]], and thanks to his ally the orogs captured the scions of five powerful noble houses of [[Melvaunt]]. Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in the crowning ceremony for Thrull.\n\nDaazlag survived the raid of an adventuring party hired by Lord [[Woarsten Nanther]], which had defeated Thrull inside Xûl-Jarak and rescued the scions. Together with his ally Bremen, he planned vengeance and during a party hosted by House Leiyraghon to celebrate the heroes, Daazlag and some orc archers attacked the guests."
