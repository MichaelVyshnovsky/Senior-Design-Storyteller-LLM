'''Syllia Adarbrent''' was a female [[Illuskan]] [[human]] [[fighter]] of the noble house of [[Adarbrent]] in [[Waterdeep]]. Syllia was the captain of the [[Hippocampus (ship)|''Hippocampus'']], the flagship of the [[Horizon Armada]], a noble-owned fleet headed by her family, the Adarbrents. She was also a member of the [[Harpers]].

==Personality==
Syllia had a quick fiery temper and an equal tenacity. She could also be impulsive. Syllia was also a natural-born sailor.

==Description==
She had flame-red hair.

==History==
In the spring of [[1371 DR]], she acted on impulse and married her lover and fellow Harper [[Farid al-Nisr|Farid yn Fahd al Nisr]], a choice not appreciated by her family. Just a few months later, the two departed for [[New Waterdeep]] in [[Maztica]], apparently intending to explore further. Unfortunately, Farid's father was [[Fahd yn Sarsor al Nisr]] and, unknown to the Adarbrents, a First Yrshelem of the [[Rundeen]]. He had plans to gain control of the Adarbrent's shipping business and its wealth.
