Tamoko was under  tall, with smooth skin and physical strength.
She was born in  on the Kozakuran isle of Mikedono. Her father sold her to the ninja Konishi clan.
Tamoko was trained in the secret Konishi dojo in Chimotoge, becoming a ninja of renown. However, one day she was sent to kill a high ranking wu jen, but the wu jen was prepared for her arrival and managed to push Tamoko through a portal to Athkatla in Amn. In fear both of the powerful wu jen and of the Konishi ninja for failing her mission, Tamoko remained in Faer√ªn and started working as an assassin until, in Baldurs Gate, she met Sarevok.
She was a lover of Sarevok, and did not wish for him to attempt to ascend to godhood and for that reason ended up being abandoned by him in favor of Cythandria.
She could not read Common and had trouble with the language.
