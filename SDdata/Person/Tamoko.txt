'''Tamoko''' was a [[ninja]] from [[Kozakura]] who served [[Sarevok]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Tamoko was under {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} tall, with smooth skin and physical strength.

==History==
She was born in {{YearlinkConvert|1424|KY}} on the Kozakuran isle of [[Mikedono]]. Her father sold her to the [[ninja]] [[Konishi clan]].

Tamoko was trained in the secret Konishi dojo in [[Chimotoge]], becoming a ninja of renown. However, one day she was sent to kill a high ranking [[wu jen]], but the wu jen was prepared for her arrival and managed to push Tamoko through a ''[[portal]]'' to [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. In fear both of the powerful wu jen and of the Konishi ninja for failing her mission, Tamoko remained in [[Faer√ªn]] and started working as an assassin until, in [[Baldur's Gate]], she met Sarevok.

==Relations==
She was a lover of [[Sarevok]], and did not wish for him to attempt to ascend to godhood and for that reason ended up being abandoned by him in favor of [[Cythandria]].

==Abilities==
She could not read [[Common]] and had trouble with the language.
