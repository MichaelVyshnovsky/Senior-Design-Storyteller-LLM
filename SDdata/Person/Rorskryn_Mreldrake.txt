'''Rorskryn Mreldrake''' was a former [[War Wizard of Cormyr]] in [[Suzail]].

==Relationships==
He was one of [[Kelgantor]]'s "wolves".{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|24-26|2}}

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]] Rorskryn was one of the War Wizards sent under [[Kelgantor]] for a raid on [[Tethgard]] where the fugitive wizard [[Elminster Aumar]] was after stealing the ''[[Royal Gorget of Battle]]''.

After the battle, he was among the known survivors.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|33|3}}

Later his superior [[Andram Rendarth]] recruited Rorskryn to check if the [[Elminster]] remained into the Royal Palace of [[Suzail]]. Elminster quickly countered with an [[enchanted]] [[wand of paralysis]], which froze two war wizards, missing Rorskryn.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|119-122|11}}

Some time later Rorskryn was ethralled by [[Manshoon]]. Together with understeward [[Corleth Fentable]], Rorskryn was summoned by Manshoon to the shop of [[Immaero Sraunter]] to receive his orders.

Later [[Alusair Obarskyr]] revealed to king [[Foril Obarskyr I]] the treason of Mreldrake; however Corleth was in the room and so Manshoon accomplished the fact.

Under his master's compulsion Rorskryn went thought a [[gate]] to [[Marsember]], where he [[polymorph]]ed himself in a young female called '''Mythandra''' that want sail to [[Turmish]], without any memory of his life as Rorskryn.

In [[1480 DR]] he went back to Suzail to bargain an agreement with a mysterious cabal of renegade [[shadovar]]. 

The cabal forced Mreldrake to kill from distance many others War Wizards using a new kind of magic he had discovered.

At last he was uncovered as the killer inside [[Castle Irlingstar]] by Elminster's party and [[Jarlin Flamtarge]], one of the Manshoon's bodies.
At last his cabal protectors were killed by Elminster and Mreldrake died.
