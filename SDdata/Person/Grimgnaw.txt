'''Grimgnaw''' was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[monk]] and member of the [[Monk of the Long Death|Monks of the Long Death]], an evil monastic order that worshiped the very essence of death, which was personified as the "Silent Lord," and sought to bring as many living beings to death as possible.

==History==
He was from [[Clan Battlehammer]] but left [[Mithral Hall]] to pursue initiation into the Order of the Long Death. Akin to the cult, Grimgnaw had a deep, morbid fascination with death and dying and detested [[undead]], as he believed undeath to be a means of escaping a natural death.

In [[Neverwinter]] during the [[Wailing Death]] in [[1372 DR]], Grimgnaw was available for hire as a henchman to the [[Hero of Neverwinter]].

Later, Grimgnaw was encountered by [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]] in [[Cania]]. It was said that after the Hero of Neverwinter defeated [[Morag]], Grimgnaw had mysteriously vanished (and, due to his presence in Cania, had apparently died in an unknown circumstance). Grimgnaw said that as [[Mephistopheles]] had abandoned Cania, it was necessary for it to have a new ruler, and proclaimed himself this ruler. He was accompanied by several companions, including [[Maugrim]] and [[Balpheron]] (a [[lich]], which was ironic as Grimnaw was reputed to despise undead in any form), as well as a [[minotaur]] named Koth Uth Kalm (which had been killed by Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] to avenge his murdered wife and child) - all of whom supported his claim to leadership of Cania. Believing that the hero posed a threat to his rule, Grimgnaw and his companions attacked them, forcing the hero to defeat them.<ref>
