Sofia Chiaroscuro was a halfling tailor from Waterdeep who relocated to Port Nyanzaru, Chult, during the late 15 century DR.
She spoke in the third person.
Sofia was a Guild tailor in Waterdeep who was sent to Port Nyanzaru to study Chultan techniques and designs. She arrived in the city with materials and Northern clothing to sell, which she hoped would surprise and delight Chultan buyers. However, all of her wares were promptly confiscated by a customs assessor.While not stated directly in Neverwinter Tomb of Annihilation, her wares were presumably confiscated because the sale of clothing in Port Nyanzaru was controlled solely by the merchant prince Zhanthi. This left her unable to do business in the city, and she subsequently sought help from the Master of the Market to acquire replacement goods.
