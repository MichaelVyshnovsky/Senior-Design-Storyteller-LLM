{{Quote|What can Sofia do for you?|Sofia Chiaroscuro}}

==Personality==
She spoke in the third person.

==History==
Sofia was a [[Order of Master Tailors, Glovers, and Mercers|Guild]] tailor in Waterdeep who was sent to Port Nyanzaru to study [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] techniques and designs. She arrived in the city with materials and [[Sword Coast|Northern]] [[clothing]] to sell, which she hoped would surprise and delight Chultan buyers. However, all of her wares were promptly confiscated by a customs assessor.<ref group="note">While not stated directly in ''[[Neverwinter: Tomb of Annihilation]]'', her wares were presumably confiscated because the sale of clothing in Port Nyanzaru was controlled solely by the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]] [[Zhanthi]]. This left her unable to do business in the city, and she subsequently sought help from the [[Tearah Initoo|Master of the Market]] to acquire replacement goods.
