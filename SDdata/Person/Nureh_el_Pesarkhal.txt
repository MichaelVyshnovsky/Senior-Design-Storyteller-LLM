Nureh yr Catahra el Pesarkhal, an exceptional spymaster of the Memnon underworld, was the wife of the crime lord Nasim yn Feroz el Pesarkhal and sister-in-law to the syl-pasha in 1370 DR. 
She was a beautiful half-elven woman with jet black hair.
Nureh utilized many guises&mdashbard, barmaid, and jhasina to name a few&mdashand many agents. The syl-pasha considered her the most skilled spymaster he had ever known.
