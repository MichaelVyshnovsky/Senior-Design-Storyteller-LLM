        "mainbody": "'''Razfallow''' was a [[half-orc]] assassin from [[Calimshan]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Born from a [[human]] father and an [[orc]] mother, Razfallow grew up to train at the [[Academy of Stealth]] in Calimshan. During this time, he attained leadership of his own team and trained [[Daryth]]. He would have promoted Daryth to be his lieutenant, but the student left the academy in fear.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, he was hired by the evil [[wizard]] [[Cyndre]] in his attempt to take over the [[Moonshae Islands]] after joining the king's council of sorcerers. He slew many members of the royal houses as well as many [[druid]]s of the Isles.\n\nHe led a team of assassins to kill [[Tristan Kendrick]], but his father, [[Bryon Kendrick|King Bryon]] sacrificed himself to save the prince. Daryth came to assist the prince and recognized his former trainer. Razfellow was able to escape and return to Cyndre.\n\nHe later accompanied the wizard [[Kryphon]] to [[Duncastle]], the forest stronghold of [[Hugh O'Roarke]]. Under the effects of magical ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[silence]]'', he disposed of the clerical and magical defenses of the stronghold of Hugh O'Roarke. However, Razfallow was killed by Daryth in the streets of Duncastle."
