        "mainbody": "'''Valraxaxath''' was a [[black dragon]] [[wizard]] who created the [[Dragons' Claw]], a [[portal]] network that spanned [[Faerûn]].",
        "Personality": "Valraxaxath believed that [[dragon]]s should learn to work together in order to hoard all the wealth in the world. He was cunning, and highly skilled when it came to getting his way with others.",
        "Abilities": "Valraxaxath was a powerful [[wizard]], and knew many [[spell]]s. Through his arcane studies, he had developed the ability to create [[portal]]s.",
        "Activities": "Valraxaxath made his lair in the semi-submerged ruins of a grand building in the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]]. There he kept the largest part of his hoard.\n\nThe lair also contained two portals, one that was part of the [[Dragons' Claw]]. The second portal connected his lair to a cave hidden in the [[Wyrmbones]], where he kept a second, smaller, part of his hoard.\n\nWhen dealing with [[humanoid]]s, Valraxaxath often used the ''[[polymorph self]]'' spell to disguise himself as a wealthy merchant or noble.",
        "Relationships": "Valraxaxath engaged in transactional relationships with many [[chromatic dragon]]s across [[Faerûn]]. Otherwise, Valraxaxath was a solitary dragon, but maintained communications with some of the [[lizardfolk]] inhabitants of the [[Great Swamp of Rethild]]."
