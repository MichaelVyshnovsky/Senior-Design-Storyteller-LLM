'''Veshal Questa''' was a female and Oracle, [[Harper]], and [[Sibylite]] of [[Savras]], who wrote a report on [[Sammaster]], delivered to [[Belhuar Thantarth]] in 1370 DR.

The report detailed the difficulty in gaining accurate details of Sammaster's life, given that [[Azuth]], due to Sammaster's crimes, had ordered that all books, scrolls, and other records, be stripped of mentions, and that it was thought Sammaster was, as of 1370 DR, still in existence.

Although Veshal's race and date of birth is unknown, she was alive in 1370 DR since this is the date of the report.
