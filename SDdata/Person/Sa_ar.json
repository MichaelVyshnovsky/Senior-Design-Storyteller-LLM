        "mainbody": "Sheikh '''Sa'ar''' was the leader of the [[Bait Mahwa]] tribe of the [[Bedine]] people for a time during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Accept my apologies, all I have is a big buck that my arrow downed yesterday. My wives have spent the morning basting it with [[honey]] and [[spice]]s, but I am sure it cannot compare to [[camel]]'s blood.|Sa'ar, demonstrating his hospitality and sarcasm.}}",
        "Description": "He was a burly man with a hard face and eyes that hinted at his cunning and experience.",
        "Personality": "Among the members of numerous Bedine tribes, Sa'ar was known as a particularly intelligent leader.",
        "Relationships": "Sa'ar had a strong ally in Sheikh [[Utaiba]], leader of the [[Raz'hadi]] tribe. During the times Sa'ar grew contentious with others, it was Utaiba who could calm his friend and help him listen to reason.",
        "History": {
            "Leader of the Bedine": "In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Sheikh Sa'ar was approached by [[Yhekal]], an agent of the [[Zhentarim]] that hoped to form an \"alliance\" between his tribe and the outlander merchant's group. The meeting was interrupted by the [[Qahtan]]i sorceress [[Ruha]] and the [[Harpers]] agent [[Lander]], who warned that the [[Zhentilar]] army slaughtered the [[Mtair Dhafir]] and Qahtan tribes. They traveled to the [[Well of the Chasm]] to regroup with tan allied tribe, routing the Zhent camp outside the oasis, and joining the [[Raz'hadi]] in another victory at the [[Battle of the Chasm]].\n\nFollowing the battles, Sa'ar and Utaiba brought together fifteen other sheikhs of the Bedine tribes to the sacred [[Elah'zad]] oasis to confer on what was to be done with the Zhentarim threat. They ultimately decided to fight as one united people, gathering all the Bedine within over a [[tenday]]'s ride away from the oasis. Under the united leadership, the Bedine went on to claim victory against the asabis at the [[Battle of the Fissures]], and finally turn away the Zhentarim from [[the Sword]] during the siege of [[Orofin]].",
            "Change of Life for the Mahwa": "{{Quote|Mounts that can fly across the sky? The Mahwa will be the masters of the desert!|Sheikh Sa'ar, to Ruha.}}\n\nOver a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Shadow Sea]] formed over the [[Shoal of Thirst]], a result of the terraforming and weather manipulation caused by the [[Shadovar]] residents of the returned [[Netherese enclave|Netherese city]] of [[Thultanthar]]. Sa'ar and the Mahwa saw this new source of water as a blessing and they regularly camped upon its shore. In short time they forewent their nomadic ways and accepted the new leisurely lifestyle presented to them.\n\nThat same year Sa'ar reunited with Ruha for the first time since their shared victory over the Zhentarim. Ruha had been discreetly traveling across Anauroch with her new allies [[Caladnei]] and [[Hhormun]] of Cormyr, in search of Thultanthar's resting place. The two parties each used the others' strength to their advantage: supported by the Cormyrean mages, Sa'ar stole a herd of the Shadovar's flying [[veserab]] mounts, and the Cormyreans used the Bedine's raid to draw out the location of the Shadovar's forces, leading back to their city."
