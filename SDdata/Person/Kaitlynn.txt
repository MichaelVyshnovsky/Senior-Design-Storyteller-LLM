'''Kaitlynn''' was a mystic of the [[Earthmother]] and a shopkeeper in [[Skullport]].

==History==
Kaitlynn was born with [[Anithlynn]] and [[Briglynn]] on board a [[Moonshae Isles]] ship to a mystic of the Earthmother, [[Celya]], who lost most of her energy in childbirth. The triplets were taught from birth the mysteries of mystics. By their thirteenth birthday, Celya had died.

In [[1379 DR]] her friend [[Laeral Silverhand]] went with the then-immaterial [[Darksong Knight]] [[Cavatina Xarann]] to met Kaitlynn and thank to her healed Cavatina. 

==Personality==
Kaitlynn was the middle of the triplets and the most responsible, always mediating between the capricious [[Anithlynn]] and the sometimes-sullen [[Briglynn]]. At heart, she was, like their mother Celya, compassionate and utterly devoted to the Earthmother. Kaitlynn was also kind and charitable.

==Activities==
Kaitlynn managed with her sisters the [[Sisters Three Waxworks]]. She was very capable of making non-magical love potions.
