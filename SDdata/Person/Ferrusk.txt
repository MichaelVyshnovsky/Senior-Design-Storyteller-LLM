Ferrusk was a corrupted druid that lived in and underneath the Misty Forest on the Sword Coast during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Ferrusk was driven to madness, presumably by his research into and use of dark druidic magic.
The dark druid had taken up residence within a corrupted grove on the banks of the subterranean Nepenthe river and gathered for himself an army of ankhegs that he referred to as his "children".
He was quite skilled at medicinal techniques, able to form curative agents from naturally-found substances such as a fungus-nullifying potion made from the bloom-sac of a myconid.
He wore a unique suit of plate armor made from bone, and wore a magical amulet that he had enchanted himself.
Ferrusk was once part of a druidic circle that venerated a sacred tree in the Misty Forest, near the cavernous entrance that led down to the Nepenthe River.While the caves location in the forest is not explicitly stated in Baldurs Gate Siege of Dragonspear, the location of the above-ground entrance to the river is stated on page 20 of the Hordes of Dragonspear adventure novel. The magic he practiced after leaving the group corrupted the druids sacred tree.
He was once considered close companions of his fellow druids, Jamven and Chorster.
During the War of the Shining Crusade, in the , Ferrusk allied himself with Hephernaan, the religious advisor to the Shining Lady Caelar Argent.
