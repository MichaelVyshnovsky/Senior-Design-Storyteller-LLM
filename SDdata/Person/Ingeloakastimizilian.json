        "mainbody": "'''Ingeloakastimizilian''', also known as '''Icingdeath''', was a [[white dragon]] who lived in a region of the [[Reghed Glacier]] known as [[Evermelt]] in [[Icewind Dale]].",
        "Activities": "He spent most of his time sleeping on a bed of ice that covered his hoard.{{Page needed}}",
        "History": "Icingdeath was killed by [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Wulfgar]] on [[Eleasis 26]] in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, after Wulfgar threw his [[warhammer]] ''[[Aegis-fang]]'' into an icicle that fell and impaled the dragon in the heart. They slew Icingdeath so Wulfgar could fulfill the unfinished quest of his father [[Beornegar]], and claim a trophy that would enable him to challenge the leader of his tribe to a duel. The dragon's horns served as this trophy.\n\nIngeloakastimizilian's nickname came to be attached to one of Drizzt Do'Urden's [[scimitar]]s, ''[[Icingdeath]]'', which he found in the dragon's hoard.\n\nEven a century after he was slain, Icingdeath's frozen corpse remained within his lair in Evermelt. It became a site of veneration by [[church of Auril|cultists]] of [[Auril]] led by [[Bjami Tengervaald]], who worshiped them as a manifestation of their goddess. Eventually, the Ice Witch [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]] directed her ''[[simulacrum]]'' to animate Icingdeath's remains as an undead, skeletal dragon to fight off a band of adventurers within Evermelt.\n[[File:Icingdeath, Frost Tyrant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ingeloakastimizilian within his lair, during or before [[1356 DR]].]]"
