        "mainbody": "Rhytella was a human priestess of Lolth from Bezantur, Thay. She was active in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDespite being the most powerful permanent member of Bezanturs Temple of Lolth, Rhytella considered herself a mere acolyte of her goddess.\nAs of the late 1360s DR, Rhytella held authority over the entire congregation of Lolth worshipers in Bezantur, However, she was not officially the High Priestess as that title and honor belonged to Triel Teienna, a drow who visited the Temple from the Underdark once every few months."
