'''Belwar Dissengulp''' was a [[svirfneblin]] of [[Blingdenstone]] and was known in the city of Blingdenstone as the "Most Honorable Burrow Warden".

==Description==
Belwar Dissengulp was a stout barrel-chested [[gnome]] with a deep voice. After Belwar's hands were cut off, his people grafted enchanted weapons on each arm instead of hands, one being a [[pick|pick-axe]] and the other a [[hammer]].

==Possessions==
His enchanted "hands" were activated by an incantation followed by the [[command word]] of "''bivrip''", which caused his weapons to buzz with power, making them useful in mining and in battle.

==History==
Belwar was with a mining party near [[Menzoberranzan]] when a [[drow]] patrol, led by [[Dinin]] and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], attacked. Every svirfneblin was killed, except for Belwar, who was allowed to live and return to Blingdenstone through Drizzt's mercy, though Dinin had Belwar's hands cut off. His hands were replaced by a finely crafted hammer and pick axe, magically enchanted to deal more damage to his foes. He rose to great status among his peers, though he was uncomfortable with the attention.

Many years later, Belwar ran into Drizzt again. After living in the [[Underdark]] in exile from the drow city of Menzoberranzan for several years, Drizzt voluntarily gave himself up to the guards of Blingdenstone in hopes of finding a peaceful home. Belwar saved Drizzt from execution by revealing Drizzt had spared his life back when he had lost his hands. He provided Drizzt with lodging at his home and personally vouched for the drow's good nature. He later accompanied Drizzt into the Underdark and participating in many adventures, before eventually returning home.

Twenty years later, Drizzt returned to the Underdark to deliver himself to the drow in Menzoberranzan in order to save his friends on the surface from their predations. He passed Blingdenstone on the way, where he and Belwar had a brief but joyous reunion before Drizzt continued on his way. When Drizzt's friend [[Catti-brie]], anxious about his safety, passed the svirfneblin's territory shortly after, she was taken into custody, and Belwar was assigned to interrogate her. Catti-brie immediately recognized Belwar from Drizzt's stories, and despite the language barrier, she managed to explain her friendship with Drizzt and learned from Belwar where Drizzt had gone.

When the drow, led by [[Yvonnel Baenre|Matron Baenre]], moved against [[Mithral Hall]], Belwar aided the dwarves in their fight against the drow by destroying several scouting parties as they passed Blingdenstone. He later convinced the citizens of Blingdenstone to head to the surface, aiding the Hall further. After the fight at the Hall, he was seen safely departing back to his home city.

When Blingdenstone was attacked by Menzoberranzan, Belwar led a group of about 350 refugees to Mithral Hall.<ref>
