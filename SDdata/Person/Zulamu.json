        "mainbody": "Zulamu was a hunting spider katanga and the strongest archer who served the Mother of a Thousand Young within the Fire Mountain of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.\nLike other hunting spider katanga, Zulamu possessed a venomous bite and could easily scale any surface. He was equally deadly in close quarters and from a great distance.\nThe creature was clad in hide armor and carried a large wooden shield, a mighty shortbow, as well as a shortspear.\nIn the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14 century DR, the Wise Ones tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of the evil spider katanga, the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Zulamu was assigned guard duties that brought him face to face with a stronger and more experienced band of heroes of the Living Jungle.\nIt was unknown if Zulamu survived the battle when the heroes infiltrated the katanga caverns."
