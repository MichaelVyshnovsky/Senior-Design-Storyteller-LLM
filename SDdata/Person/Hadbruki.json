Whine and beg at our feet, southerners, and we \"might* only take all of your belongings.''|Hadbruki}}",
        "Possessions": "Hadbruki wielded a unique [[enchanted]] bludgeon called the ''[[Azure Rod]]''.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Hadbruki's tribe fell on hard times, forcing Uthgardts to consume their [[giant raven]]s. This turned the tribe aggressive to outsiders, especially to those who trespassed into the Black Raven's hunting grounds in the Cold Marshes. In [[Mirtul]] of 1312 DR, a group of mercenaries from the town of [[Targos]] ended up passing through the [[Fell Wood]] and across the tribe's territory. Hadbruki confronted the adventurers and threatened them with violence. Hadbruki and his entire hunting party of barbarians attacked the mercenaries but lost their lives in the process."
