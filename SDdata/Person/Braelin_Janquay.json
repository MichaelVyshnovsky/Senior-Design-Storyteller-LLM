Presumably, Braelin was one of these spies. Braelin discovered Regiss true identity, saved him from Ship Rethnor thugs, and reported on him and Catti-brie to Jarlaxle. He was also the one to report on Dahlia Sinfelles ascension to matron mother of House DoUrden.\nBraelin was considered one of Bregan Daerthes most promising scouts.\nBraelins Bregan Daerthe insignia enabled him to levitate. He wielded two swords, as well as a crossbow."
