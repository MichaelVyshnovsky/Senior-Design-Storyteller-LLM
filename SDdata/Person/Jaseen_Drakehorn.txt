Jaseen Drakehorn was the High Blade of Mulmaster.
Jaseen quietly ruled Mulmaster, supported by the Church of Bane, until 1491 DR. Selfaril Uoumdolphin, the High Blade who ruled until 1375 DR, resurfaced in 1491 DR to challenge her dominion over the city.
Selfaril gained support among the citizens of Mulmaster and challenged Jaseen to a public duel.
Jaseen was a devoted follower of Bane.
