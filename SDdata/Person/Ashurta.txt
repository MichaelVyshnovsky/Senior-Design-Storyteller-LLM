Ashurta was a mystic and one of the leaders of the Sand Kings rebel group in Anauroch in 1479 DR.
When Ashurta was very young, a Shadovar patrol killed her parents. In time, she became the leader of the Sand Kings.
In 1479 DR, the Sand Kings discovered that the Shadovar were on the verge of gaining control of the Spiral Gate, a crucial portal nexus. So they tried to sabotage the Shadovars efforts.
Some of her group recovered one of the scroll fragments needed to activate the portal to the Spiral Gate but were pursued by Durbela and his troops. A group of adventurers became involved in the incident, and she offered to hire the adventurers to assist her in her fight against the Shadovar.
Ashurta had dedicated her life to destroying the Shadovar. She had an analytical mind and a thoughtful demeanor, making her a good tactician.
