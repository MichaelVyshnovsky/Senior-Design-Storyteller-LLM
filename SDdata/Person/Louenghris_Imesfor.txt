Louenghris Imesfor was a gold elf that served as a member of the the Evereskan Tomb Guard during the late 14 century DR.
At 110 years old, Louenghris was still young and brash for an elf.
Louneghris was the son of Gervas Imesfor, a councilor of Evereksas Hill Elders.
On Nightal 20 of the , Louenghris and his fellow tomb guardians were sent to investigate a band of tomb robbers within the crypts of House Vyshaan in the depths of the Greypeak Mountains. Unfortunately, the young elf and his fellow members of the rear guard were ambushed by humans from Vaasa they were hunting down. While the elven guards eventually apprehended the intruders, Louenghris suffered a blow to the head and was knocked unconscious.
The contingent of tomb guards was decimated after a few of the elves wandered behind the Sharn Wall and drew the attention of a phaerimm. Louenghris was among the elves killed that day.
