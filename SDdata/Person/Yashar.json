        "mainbody": "'''Yashar''' was a male [[medusa]] that guarded the [[Undying Temple]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].",
        "Description": "He was only 5 ft (1.5 m) tall and sported a supple but tough body.",
        "Personality": "Yashar was an intensely striking individual, whose presence could draw the eye of even casual observers, albeit to their detriment.",
        "Abilities": "As a medusa, Yashar employed the abilities famed by his kind to petrify those who met his gaze. This ability was augmented by the ''[[see invisibility|ring of ethereal sight]]'' that he wore, which enabled his petrifying glare to affect even creatures on the [[ethereal plane]].\n\nYashar had also cultivated fairly potent [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] powers, with an emphasis on manipulating [[force]] energy, owing to its effectiveness against [[Incorporeal (subtype)|incorporeal]] creatures. He could create an impenetrable ''[[wall of force]]'' or conjure a deadly ''[[thunderlance]]'' to help him in battle, among many other spells.\n\nAdditionally, Yashar was an adroit archer and could fire his arrows accurately even when outnumbered or in close-quarters. If pressed, the numerous snakes that formed his hair could still keep an enemy occupied.",
        "Possessions": "Yashar a wielded a ''+2 [[shortbow]]'' in battle. He had few possessions besides a set of ''[[bracers of armor]]'' and a ''ring of ethereal sight''. In his chamber, Yashar liked to collect small petrified animals of the [[Underdark]], such as [[lizard]]s and [[rat]]s.",
        "Relationships": "Although he had a small [[viper]] as a [[familiar]], Yashar declined to name the creature.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], during the Silence of Lolth, the [[hierophant|high priestess]] of [[Kiaransalee]] in [[Maerimydra]] took advantage of the chaos and staged a coup of [[House Chumavh]] and took control of [[Castle Maerimydra]]. From the Castle, the [[cleric|priestess]], [[Irae T'sarran]], summoned forth the Undying Temple to enact her ''[[great revenance]]'' spell. Yashar was one of the select few allowed inside the temple and was responsible for defending the [[portal]] to the [[ethereal plane]] that lay within it."
