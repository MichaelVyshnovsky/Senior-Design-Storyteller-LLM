        "mainbody": "'''Tamara''' was a clerk who served \"special\" clients of [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Smokepowder in its earthier forms. For purists only.''|Clerk Tamara}}",
        "Description": "Tamara was an ashy-skinned [[Lolthite]] [[drow]] with snow-white hair and a stern orderly personality. She was armed with a [[dagger]] and wore white [[robe]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Cult of the Absolute]] planted its roots in Baldur's Gate and ravaged the [[Western Heartlands]], Felogyr's Fireworks shop fell under the cult's sway. Its proprietor, [[Avery Sonshal]], was made into a [[True Soul]] and used the shop as a front for the cult's terrorist activities. During that time, Tamara was employed as the shop's clerk that serviced \"friends of Felogyr,\" selling them the shop's more dangerous weaponized stock, like bombs and ''[[smokepowder arrow]]s''. She operated from the shop's second floor, which was only accessible to customers who knew a code phrase, and warned anyone from proceeding to the shop's third floor, which was off-limits to all but the [[Banite]] members of the Cult of the Absolute.\n\nDuring that time, on orders from Avery Sonshal, Tamara supplied a toymaker member of the cult with explosives. In turn, the toymaker planned to ship the deadly explosive toys to the refugees that flooded [[Rivington]]. However, Avery also ordered Tamara to turn the toymaker down were he to come for more explosives â€“ the proprietor wanted to keep Felogyr's Fireworks' name clean."
