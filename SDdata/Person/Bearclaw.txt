'''Bearclaw''' was an unsavory [[barbarian]] [[gnome]] [[mercenary]] from the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Bearclaw was a light-skinned gnomish woman with brown eyes and short bright-red hair. She wore barbarian hides and hid her face behind a crimson mask. The gnome used a massive [[axe]] in battle.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the opportunistic and amoral mercenary [[Aradin Beno]] set out to find the [[Nightsong]] for the [[mage]] [[Lorroakan]]. If the Nightsong, in reality a [[Sel√ªnite]] [[aasimar]], was to reach the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. The barbarian Bearclaw was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the [[Elfsong Tavern]] to kill and kidnap.
