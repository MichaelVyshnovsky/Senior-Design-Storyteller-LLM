'''Ott Steeltoes''' was the most competent smuggler of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] of [[Skullport]].

==History==
Ott was a renegade of the [[Ironmaster]] clan. He first worked as a pirate, but later was offered a place in the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild. He quickly accepted, liking the prospect of more power and a less dangerous life.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the reorganization of the guild (and the secret change of the guild master) gave him more freedom in his thieving operations, which Ott greatly enjoyed. He became good friends with [[Ahmaergo]] and the two [[dwarves]] often drank together.

Around [[1492 DR]] Ott was the caretaker of [[Sylgar]], the pet fish of the [[Xanathar]].{{Waterdeep-time}}
