        "mainbody": "'''Big Belchy''' was a unique [[construct]], designed to resemble a [[dragon turtle]], that was created by the [[Gondar]] clergy of the [[House of Inspired Hands]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "This construct had an internal mechanism that allowed it to exhale clouds of scalding steam, in emulation of the [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] that dragon turtles possessed.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, the clergy of the House of Inspired Hands presented their artificial dragon turtle to the [[Waterdhavian]] public on [[Marpenoth 3]], as part of a nautical exhibition for the annual [[Day of Wonders]]. The construct managed to make one full rotation around [[Deepwater Harbor]] before sinking into the depths, becoming part of [[Umberlee's Cache]].\n\nFor the next century, the construct would remain at the bottom of Deepwater Harbor, left to accumulate [[barnacle]]s on its metal shell.\n\nThen, in autumn of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a group of [[Lantan|Lantanese]] [[rock gnome]]s under the employ of the [[drow]] [[mercenary]] [[Jarlaxle]] managed to enact repairs upon the long-abandoned construct, allowing Big Belchy to surface once more. One day, a group of [[adventurer]]s cornered  in [[Mistshore]] two [[firearm|gun-toting]] agents of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], [[Fel'rekt Lafeen]] and [[Krebbyg Masq'il'yr]], that had in their possession the ''[[stone of Golorr]]''. Big Belchy surfaced from the water not long after, acting as their getaway vehicle to Jarlaxle's flagship, the ''[[Eyecatcher]]''. According to some accounts, the adventurers managed to inflict enough damage upon the construct to force it to sink back into the depths of Deepwater Harbor.{{WDH-time}}"
