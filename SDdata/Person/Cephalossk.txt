'''Cephalossk''' was the [[ulitharid]] Creedmaster of the [[Venerator Creed]] in [[Oryndoll]] by [[1370 DR]] and through [[1372 DR]]. Its position and its powers made Cephalossk the second most powerful individual in the city.

==History==
Cephalossk was the leader of the Creed of the Venerators, and so the high priest of [[Ilsensine]] and a member of the [[Elder Concord]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] when the [[avatar]] of Ilsensine manifested in Oryndoll.

In the early 1490s [[DR]], however, Cephalossk had become a pariah among his own kind for his desire to become an arcanist. He went to study at the magic academy of [[Dweomercore]] inside [[Undermountain]].
 
==Possessions==
Like its fellow Creedmasters, Cephalossk received a pair of ''[[tendril rings of Ilsensine]]''. However, these bracers had additional, secret powers, many not yet known even to Cephalossk and which it was still learning.

==Relationships==
Cephalossk had a constant mental link with the [[Encephalithid]].
