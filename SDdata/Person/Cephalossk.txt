Cephalossk was the ulitharid Creedmaster of the Venerator Creed in Oryndoll by 1370 DR and through 1372 DR. Its position and its powers made Cephalossk the second most powerful individual in the city.
Cephalossk was the leader of the Creed of the Venerators, and so the high priest of Ilsensine and a member of the Elder Concord during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR when the avatar of Ilsensine manifested in Oryndoll.
In the early 1490s DR, however, Cephalossk had become a pariah among his own kind for his desire to become an arcanist. He went to study at the magic academy of Dweomercore inside Undermountain.
Like its fellow Creedmasters, Cephalossk received a pair of tendril rings of Ilsensine. However, these bracers had additional, secret powers, many not yet known even to Cephalossk and which it was still learning.
Cephalossk had a constant mental link with the Encephalithid.
