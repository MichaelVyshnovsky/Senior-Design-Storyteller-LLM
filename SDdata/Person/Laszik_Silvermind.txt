'''Laszik Silvermind''' was a renowned [[psion]] [[mystic]] and devotee of the god [[Auppenser]] who reformed the empire of [[Jhaamdath]] during the 6{{th}} millennium before [[Dalereckoning]].

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-5730}}, the Lord of Reason used Laszik Silvermind to speak to the Jhaamdathan people and reveal a grand plan by which the empire would grow and prosper. His first divine precept was the abolition of slavery, which was swiftly enacted all around the empire.

Laszik went on to fashion a new and powerful [[psionic]] [[artifact]] in {{Yearlink|-5725}}. The ''[[udoxias]]'', as it was called, permitted all psionic beings in mental [[contact]] with it to access one of the many psionic powers stored inside. Installed in the capital city, [[Naarkolyth]], its effect reached for miles around, drawing people from far and wide to learn the novel mind magic.

As psionic training and knowledge flourished in Naarkolyth, Laszik established the Udoclian in {{Yearlink|-5710}}. This university taught and promoted the Invisible Art.

In {{Yearlink|-5700}}, in accordance with Auppenser's plan, Jhaamdath replaced its former oligarchy with a psiocratic system of government.

Finally, in {{Yearlink|-5690}}, now of advanced years, Laszik Silvermind disappeared inexplicably. The faithful believed that the mystic had ascended in mind and body to serve the Lord of Reason directly by his side.
