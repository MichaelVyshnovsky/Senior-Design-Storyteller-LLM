        "mainbody": "'''Lady Oonagh''' was an [[elf|elven]] noblewoman and an adventurer from the [[Forest of Tethir]], active sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Lady Oonagh hailed from a musically-inclined noble elven family, but unlike them, Oonagh had no musical talent and was a particularly bad singer. She often adventured with her companion and lover [[Lord Alex]]. Lady's long-time mate one year presented her with a gag birthday gift, the [[enchanted]] [[lute]], later known as ''[[Lady Oonagh's ludicrously loud lute]]''. Alex found it appropriate that the lute and Oonagh's voice both sounded so terrible and intense, they caused profuse ear bleeding."
