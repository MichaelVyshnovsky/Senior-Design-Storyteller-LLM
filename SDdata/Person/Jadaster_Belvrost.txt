'''Jadaster Belvrost''' was a member of the [[Belvrost]] clan of [[mage]]s as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
By {{yearlink|1370}}, he was an investor in [[Telpir]]. As a hobby, he improved locks and locking spells to better withstand attacks.

==Personality==
By the same year, Jadaster was growing increasingly restless under the desire for an exotic wife.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was possible that Jadaster's sudden fetish for exotic mages was an inborn curse by [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]], as Belvrost mages of either gender had long been known to desire wedding magically skilled folks from far places. Even where marriage failed to endure or materialize, the children produced joined the clan.
