They tended towards direct combat application.\nGamara wore a headband of protection and a ring of wizardry, and carried a magical staff and a wand of fire.\nIn the , Gamara and her allies attended a party at Thistleflame Keep hosted by Lord Partic Thistle, only to be horribly upset by a ballad performed by Mendryll Belarod that made Sembites into an object of mockery. She and the rest of the Stag Runners later ambushed Mendryll to exact \"justice\" on him, but were defeated by him and other adventurers."
