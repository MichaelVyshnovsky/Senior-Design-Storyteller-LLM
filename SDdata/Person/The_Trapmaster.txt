The Trapmaster was an itinerant wizard of the late 13 century DR. He became the teacher of Ohland Grethgar.
He was charismatic.
The Trapmaster was able to create helmed horrors, dreads, other partial-body guardians, and "zombie doors". He could cast wizard lock.
He cast variants on wizard lock spells and used magic to create wards, guardians, and traps, in Calimshan and around the Shining Sea, getting a very good living out of it.
He offered an apprenticeship to Ohland Grethgar, who accepted.
The Trapmaster offered an apprenticeship to Ohland Grethgar at some point after the death of Iriskree he hoped Ohland Grethgar would be able to complete work on doors that defended themselves with beams of light to stab at foes, and on magically altering locks, both of which were tasks he succeeded at.
He was ultimately slain by Jaelaera Sundeirnyn.
