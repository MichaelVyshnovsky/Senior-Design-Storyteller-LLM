'''The Trapmaster''' was an itinerant wizard of the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. He became the teacher of [[Ohland Grethgar]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|67}}

==Personality==
He was charismatic.

==Abilities==
The Trapmaster was able to create [[helmed horror]]s, [[dread]]s, other partial-body guardians, and "[[zombie door]]s". He could cast ''[[wizard lock]]''.

==Activities==
He cast variants on ''wizard lock'' spells and used magic to create wards, guardians, and [[trap]]s, in [[Calimshan]] and around the [[Shining Sea]], getting a very good living out of it.

==Relationships==
He offered an apprenticeship to [[Ohland Grethgar]], who accepted.

==History==
The Trapmaster offered an apprenticeship to Ohland Grethgar at some point after the death of [[Iriskree]]; he hoped Ohland Grethgar would be able to complete work on doors that defended themselves with beams of light to stab at foes, and on magically altering locks, both of which were tasks he succeeded at.

He was ultimately slain by [[Jaelaera Sundeirnyn]].
