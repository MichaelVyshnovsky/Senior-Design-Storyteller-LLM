        "mainbody": "Ricnan Midler was the head of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar in Cormyr.\nRicnan was a middle-aged man with tied-back brown hair and a neat brown waistcoat outfit.\nRicnan was the son of Neris and Ianhand, and brother of Quilynn. He had wed Jandove, and together they had their two sons Normon and Thoben.\nDuring the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.\nRicnan was held captive in the kitchen of the house, alongside his sister Quilynn and his son Normon, guarded by several drow invaders."
