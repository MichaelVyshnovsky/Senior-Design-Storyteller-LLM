Irlin Stonestable was a noble in Cormyr and lord of the Stonestable noble house.
Lord Stonestable was grim-hearted, but steadfast.
Per Arclath Delcastle, Irlin Stonestable ran with a circle that included the lords Broryn Windstag, Delasko Sornstern, Mellast Ormblade, Kathkote Dawntard, Sacrast Handragon, and Marlin Stormserpent. He was one of the more formidable lords there.
He was with Marlin when Broryn Windstags posse got kicked out of the Dragonriders Club, and went to Stormserpent Towers afterwards.
In the calamitous aftermath of the Council of the Dragon days after, he met with Broryn Windstag at Staghaven House, where the rest of their faction slowly turned up. Lord Stonestable was incredulous at the word on the street being that Cormyr was on the verge of civil war. While he was there, the moot was joined by Traevyn Illance, Marlin Stormserpent, and briefly visited by Osbur.
