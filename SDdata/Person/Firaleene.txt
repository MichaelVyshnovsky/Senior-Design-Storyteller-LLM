'''Firaleene''' was a [[sphinx]] who lived inside of the [[primordial]] [[Achazar]] as of [[1480 DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|18}}

==History==
Firaleene was an immensely powerful and ancient sphinx who lived in [[Laerakond]] centuries before the [[Spellplague]]. When Achazar fell asleep and transformed into the Raging Flame, the pillar of fire amid [[Tarmalune]], she went to live inside the primordial's consciousness.

In 1480 DR, Firaleene hampered the efforts of the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]] to awaken Achazar, with the help of the primordial himself. She also helped to cure [[Myrelas]] and some [[adventurer]]s from a curse of madness imposed on them by [[Inar Venenellin|Pyrultimus]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|21}}
