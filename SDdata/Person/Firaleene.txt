Firaleene was a sphinx who lived inside of the primordial Achazar as of 1480 DR.
Firaleene was an immensely powerful and ancient sphinx who lived in Laerakond centuries before the Spellplague. When Achazar fell asleep and transformed into the Raging Flame, the pillar of fire amid Tarmalune, she went to live inside the primordials consciousness.
In 1480 DR, Firaleene hampered the efforts of the Cult of Reborn Flame to awaken Achazar, with the help of the primordial himself. She also helped to cure Myrelas and some adventurers from a curse of madness imposed on them by Pyrultimus.
