        "Description": "Jandove was a middle-aged woman with a bob of brown hair, dressed in a long gray dress.",
        "Relationships": "Jandove was the child of [[Wilaver Chandler|Wilaver]] and [[Caryn Chandler]], and sister of [[Graven Chandler|Graven]]. She was the spouse of [[Ricnan Midler|Ricnan]], and mother of their sons [[Normon Midler|Normon]] and [[Thoben Midler|Thoben]].",
        "History": "During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], the [[drow]] forces of [[Vicala Szind]] attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant [[Maisby]] had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of [[Purple Dragons]] and then a team of [[adventurer]]s to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.\n\nJandove was kept contained by magical paralysis in the master bedroom with her brother Graven, under the watch of a few disgruntled drow. When saved, she showed the rescuers a passage into the attic space that would allow them to better sneak around the prowling priestess."
