        "mainbody": "Jandove Midler was a member of the extended Midler-Chandler family in the mid-1480s DR, who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar.\nJandove was a middle-aged woman with a bob of brown hair, dressed in a long gray dress.\nJandove was the child of Wilaver and Caryn Chandler, and sister of Graven. She was the spouse of Ricnan, and mother of their sons Normon and Thoben.\nDuring the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave. Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.\nJandove was kept contained by magical paralysis in the master bedroom with her brother Graven, under the watch of a few disgruntled drow. When saved, she showed the rescuers a passage into the attic space that would allow them to better sneak around the prowling priestess."
