'''Rhovann Disarnnyl''' was a powerful [[moon elf]] [[mage]] formerly of [[Myth Drannor]] who was active in the [[Moonsea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He fought and lost a duel with [[Geran Hulmaster]] over a [[moon elf]] maiden and lost a hand in the battle. Geran was banished from [[Myth Drannor]] for his crime.

Later, Rhovann was banished himself for practicing forbidden dark magic.

Rhovann was driven by his desire for revenge against Geran, and, in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Rhovann sought out his old nemesis and helped to stage a coup in [[Hulburg]] that deposed the [[Hulmaster]]s. Rhovann used spells to dominate the mind of the leader of the merchant council, [[Maroth Marstel]], turning him into Rhovann's puppet. He then solidified his hold over Hulmaster by creating [[runehelm golem]]s using his shadow magic.

Rhovann was slain by Geran Hulmaster in the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, at [[Griffonwatch Keep]] in Hulburg.
