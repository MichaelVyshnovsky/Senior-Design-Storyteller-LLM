'''Toblen Stonehill''' was the proprietor of the [[Stonehill Inn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Toblen was a young man who was quite short and very friendly.

==Relationships==
Toblen had a wife, [[Trilena Stonehill|Trilena]], a son, [[Pip Stonehill|Pip]],

His staff included the barmaid, [[Elsa]].

He owed a small amount of money to the local banker, [[Harbin Wester]].

==History==
Toblen and his family were originally from [[Triboar]]. Their son, Pip, was born in the early 1480s DR, and a few years later they moved west to [[Phandalin]]. Toblen had come to search for mineral wealth, but was not experienced enough to make a career of it. The town had room for an inn, and when the opportunity to open one presented itself, Stonehill took it.

He disdained the [[Redbrands]], who struck terror into the villagers in [[1491 DR]].{{Phandelver-time}} However, he did not take the matter into his own hands as he feared that the brigands would bring much harm to his family. His frustration for the then-townmaster [[Harbin Wester]]'s inaction toward the ruffians soured their relationship.

When his son Pip went missing shortly after, Tolben sought out [[adventurer]]s to go and find him.

By [[1496 DR]], Pip was old enough to help run the business. That year, Harbin Wester began seeking ways to leverage Toblen's debts to seize control of the inn.
