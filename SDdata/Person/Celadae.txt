Celadae was a human cleric of Torm who left her temple to fight for her god after receiving a divine vision.
Underneath the helm she wore in battle, Celadae had shoulder-length brown hair. She had light brown eyes and light skin.
Celadae wore a suit of plate mail, complete with helm, tabard, and shield. Her weapon of choice was a magical mace.
Upon turning 20 years of age, Celadae received a vision from Torm, calling upon her to venture into the world as a warrior-priest.
