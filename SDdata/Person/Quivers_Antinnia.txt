Quivers Antinnia was an unsavory human archer mercenary from the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Quivers was a dark-skinned human male adorned in quality leathers.
In the , the opportunistic and amoral mercenary Aradin Beno set out to find the Nightsong for the mage Lorroakan. If the Nightsong, in reality a Sel√ªnite aasimar, was to reach the city of Baldurs Gate, then Beno had a band of mercenaries with questionable morals ready to attack those who sheltered her. The archer named Quivers Antinnia was among those mercenaries, ready to break into the Elfsong Tavern to kill and kidnap.
