'''Mirrormul Tszul''' was a [[human]] sage in the city of [[Waterdeep]] around [[1368 DR]]. His expertise was centered around the biology and languages of both humans and [[giants]], though he also had a minor specialty in [[demihuman]] languages.

==Personality==
Mirrormul was a very energetic, excitable yet nervous man. He was known to speak at a breakneck pace, even when calm. His excitable energy was quite visible whenever someone inquired with a task or question, as his emotions always got swept up in the chance to tackle an intellectual challenge.

==Activities==
Mirrormul was a devout worshiper of [[Silvanus]]. As such, he never hesitated to accept requests for aid from the god's [[priest]]s.
