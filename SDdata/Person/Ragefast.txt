'''Ragefast''' was a well-respected [[sage]] living in [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Ragefast was a slight and frail man with a beard and roguish aspect. He was quick to laugh.

==Home==
He made his home and office in his house between the [[High House of Wonders]] and the harbor. It was tall and narrow and had a green roof.

==Activities==
By [[1358 DR]], Ragefast's areas of expertise were in the history and genealogy of the [[Sword Coast]] and humankind's mastery of [[magic]]. He was widely respected as a scholar in these fields.

He was typically found at his home, reading old books and records from all around [[Faerûn]] delivered to him by merchants. Ragefast's library was reputed to rival [[Candlekeep]] for magical lore, and some said it was better protected. There were incredible, but contradictory, rumors of his guardian creatures and [[spell]]s.

==History==
Some years before [[1357 DR]], Ragefast was the first to identify the magical shield ''[[Grimjaw]]'' borne by the adventurer [[Krystus|Krystus the Proud]].

Ragefast was one of the more notable personalities of Baldur's Gate ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].

In the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], Ragefast gave a lecture to an audience in Baldur's Gate on the history of the [[Harpers]].

Ragefast was still working through [[1367 DR]].
