Lizard King Scalecrusher was a lizardfolk monarch of the Muckmarsh tribe in Twilight Marsh near Phlan in he late 15 century DR.
During his reign, the Muckmarsh lizardfolk achieved great advancements in warfare by crafting weapons to conquer the Rootwater and Dusk-Dusk tribes.
Over the years, King Scalecrusher amassed a small fortune of six platinum pieces, 196 gold pieces, a single agate, and one jar of Keoghtoms ointment.
In the , the black dragon Throstulgrael arrived to the Twilight Marsh and laid waste to many lizardfolk communities. Scalecrusher remained defiant, making a last stand at Kings Island in the Ringcurrent archipelago.
The kings mighty efforts were made in vain however, as Throstulgrael killed Scalecrusher and leveled the island fortress with his acidic breath. The dragon enslaved the Muckmarsh tribe along with the other two nearby tribes.
The king was survived by one known son, Bogclaw.
