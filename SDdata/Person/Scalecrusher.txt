==Possessions==
Over the years, King Scalecrusher amassed a small fortune of six [[platinum piece]]s, 196 [[gold piece]]s, a single [[agate]], and one jar of ''[[Keoghtom's ointment]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|18}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the [[black dragon]] [[Throstulgrael]] arrived to the Twilight Marsh and laid waste to many lizardfolk communities. Scalecrusher remained defiant, making a last stand at [[King's Island]] in the [[Ringcurrent Islands|Ringcurrent]] archipelago.

The king's mighty efforts were made in vain however, as Throstulgrael killed Scalecrusher and leveled the island fortress with his acidic breath. The dragon enslaved the Muckmarsh tribe along with the other two nearby tribes.{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|5}}

==Relationships==
The king was survived by one known son, [[Bogclaw]].
