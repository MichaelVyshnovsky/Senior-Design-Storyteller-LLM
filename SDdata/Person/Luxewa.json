        "Activities": "Luxewa laired in some caves in the south of the [[Galena Mountains]], near [[Mulmaster]]. \n\nWhen threatened, she preferred to fight from a distance with [[spell]]s, but if forced into melee, she would attempt to inflict [[demon fever]] on her enemies.",
        "History": "In 1373 DR, the area was conquered by the [[fire giant]] brothers [[Soluf]] and [[Gharod]] but as they were not very smart, Luxewa often acted as their advisor."
