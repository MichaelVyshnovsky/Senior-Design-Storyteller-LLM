'''Golin Vend''' was a resident of [[Beregost]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He often acted as a guide of sorts to newcomers in town.

He was quite proud that his town boasted the "best smithy in all the realms", [[Taerom Fuiruim]], who ran the [[Thunderhammer Smithy]]. Golin considered the [[Red Sheaf]] to be a lower-quality inn, when compared to the [[Jovial Juggler]] or [[Burning Wizard]].
