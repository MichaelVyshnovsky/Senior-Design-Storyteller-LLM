Lenta Moore was a member of the Watch of Baldurs Gate in 1479 DR.
Lenta was the daughter of an Upper City rich merchant member of the Parliament of Peers. She wanted join the Flaming Fists but her father rejected the idea, as Lenta might be sent off to die in places like the Calim Desert. So instead she joined the Watch and in time was promoted to captain thanks to her sword-mastery. However, Grand Duke Torlin Silvershield demoted her to sergeant in 1479 DR.
