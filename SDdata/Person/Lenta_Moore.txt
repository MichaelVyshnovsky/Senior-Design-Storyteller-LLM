'''Lenta Moore''' was a member of the [[City Watch (Baldur's Gate)|Watch]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Lenta was the daughter of an [[Upper City]] rich merchant member of the [[Parliament of Peers]]. She wanted join the [[Flaming Fists]] but her father rejected the idea, as Lenta might be sent off to die in places like the [[Calim Desert]]. So instead she joined the Watch and in time was promoted to captain thanks to her sword-mastery. However, [[Grand Duke]] [[Torlin Silvershield]] demoted her to sergeant in 1479 DR.
