Orrin Glass was a scribe and a member of the Avowed who lived in Candlekeep during the late 15 century DR.
The elderly scholar was completely deaf in one ear.
Orrin was quite forgetful and became flustered very easily.
Orrin served as one of the Avowed Adjutants, guides that escorted visitors through Candlekeeps hallowed libraries.
