Shradin discovered the ruins of Sargauth Enclave and, with permission from Halaster, converted it into a trading post that later flourished as Skullport. He became known as the Lord of Bones and took up exploring the Undermountain during Halasters occasional absences.\nWhen Shradin returned to Skullport, he had become frail and addled, his mind ruined by the horrors of Undermountain. Though still feared, much of his respect had been lost.

Since then, no one challenged the rule of the Skulls."
