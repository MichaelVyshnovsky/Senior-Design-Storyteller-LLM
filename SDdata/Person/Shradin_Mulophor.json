        "mainbody": "Shradin Mulophor was an immortal human necromancer hailing from ancient Netheril who later developed and reigned over the subterranean city of Skullport.\nHe somehow survived the fall of Netheril and lived a thousand years after.\nHe arrived at Undermountain in the , during a period of major construction and expansion of the dungeon by Halaster Blackcloak. Shradin discovered the ruins of Sargauth Enclave and, with permission from Halaster, converted it into a trading post that later flourished as Skullport. He became known as the Lord of Bones and took up exploring the Undermountain during Halasters occasional absences.\nWhen Shradin returned to Skullport, he had become frail and addled, his mind ruined by the horrors of Undermountain. Though still feared, much of his respect had been lost. During the chaos of Halasters Higharvestide in 1369 DR, the Skulls of Skullport mounted a combined assault on Shradin, reducing him to a fine red mist. Since then, no one challenged the rule of the Skulls."
