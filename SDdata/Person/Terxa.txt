{{Quote|...It may be that the [[Myth Drannor]] [[phaerimm]] have a part to play in this. What remains of the [[mythal]] there interferes with the shadow-watchers, and they are not even certain they have found them all.|Lord Terxa, to [[Galaeron Nihmedu]].}}

==Relationships==
He enjoyed the benefit of having the Most High's ear, and his perspective was as trusted as his contemporary [[Hadrhune]].

==History==
In [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Lord Terxa convinced High Prince Telamont Tanthul to inform their [[shadow adept]] agent [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] about Shadovar provocation of the [[phaerimm]] beneath [[Myth Drannor]], and that the creatures planned to strike back at [[Thultanthar]]'s [[mythallar]].
