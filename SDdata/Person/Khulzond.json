        "mainbody": "'''Khulzond''' was an ancient [[vampire]] and partner of [[Mordroka]]; together, they were once masters of the [[Skull Crag Keep]] in the [[Storm Horns]] of [[Cormyr]], before it was taken over by the Crown, long before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''The cub has failed us, but no matter. We have had ample time to reach our full strength.''|Khulzond}}",
        "Description": "Khulzond was dressed in rich clothes and a black cloak. His voice sounded like harsh and malevolent croak.",
        "Abilities": "Khulzond possessed all powers of a vampire of his great age. He could control vermin creatures with her will, and all vampires created by him were under the master's absolute control.",
        "Possessions": "Khulzond wielded a powerful ''+4'' [[enchanted]] [[longsword]], wore a ''+4'' magical [[banded mail]], and defended himself with a ''+4'' [[shield]] and a powerful ''[[ring of protection]].''",
        "History": "The Skull Crag Keep once belonged to a vampire couple, aged around 1200 years by the 1360s DR. Khulzond and his consort Mordroka were forced out, and the Keep was taken by the [[Purple Dragons]] who later established the [[Roadwarden Guard]]. Both vampires survived the conflict and swore vengeance.\n\nBy the early 1360s DR, Mordroka and Khulzond accumulated power and influence among monsters who dwelled in the Storm Horns and the [[Tunlands]]. They also controlled vampires, some of whom still slumbered in an ancient mausoleum deep underneath the Skull Crag Keep, and a powerful [[beholder]] who aided the duo in their attempt to take back the Keep.\n\nThe vampires' plot began with the disappearance of [[Vidruand Starbrow]], the heroic son of the Roadwarden, [[Arelin Starbrow]]. Believed to be missing or dead, Vidruand was turned into Mordroka's vampire thrall. The bloodsuckers commanded Vidruand to join a force of monsters and slay his famous and much beloved mother. The hero's death was imminent, but the plan was somewhat derailed when Vidruand lost most of the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' to the monsters, only keeping the horned ''Helm of the Roadwarden''. The ''Arms'' were not only symbols of the office but also a powerful set of artifacts from the Keep.\n\nA group of caravan guards joined Arelin Starbrow's surviving children in defense of Skull Crag and the recovery of lost items. When two out of three ''Arms'' were returned to the Keep, Mordroka and Khulzond sent a vampire thrall named [[Keremish]] to kidnap Arelin's husband, Vidruand's father&mdash;[[Morudel]] of [[Marsember]], holding the man hostage, only returning him in exchange for the recovered ''Arms''. However, that plot was ruined by the adventuring group, which aided the Keep's defense.\n\nWith the last attempt to claim the full set of ''Arms,'' Vidruand Starbrow revealed himself to the family and the defenders of the Keep, claiming that the adventurers were the ones who slew the Roadwarden Arelin. That lie was easily seen through, and the prodigal son revealed his vampiric nature to the defenders, attacking them with an army of [[giant rat]]s and [[mobat]]s. Vidruand was defeated and seemingly killed when two sinister dark figures floated into the Keep's Great Hall. Mordroka and Khulzond revealed themselves. Mordroka wielded her spells ''[[paralyzing]]'' the defenders and commanded her thrall Vidruand Starbrow back, forcing him to recompose out of mist back into the physical form. She willed the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' to dart toward her servant, completing the set and getting ready to slay the Keep's defenders. However, [[Lunit Bdufe]], a [[cleric]] of [[Sune]], countered Mordroka's magic with the last of her strength, releasing the siblings, the adventurers, [[Sir Dutiocs]], and pulling the ''Arms'' away from the vampire.\n\nAfter a battle between the vampires and the heirs of the Skull Crag Keep, the vampires were defeated. However, it was not recorded who took the mantle of the Roadwarden in the end. One thing was clear, however, Mordroka and Khulzond were repelled from Skull Crag but not destroyed, likely to menace the fort again."
