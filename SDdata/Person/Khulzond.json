        "mainbody": "Khulzond was an ancient vampire and partner of Mordroka together, they were once masters of the Skull Crag Keep in the Storm Horns of Cormyr, before it was taken over by the Crown, long before the mid-14 century DR.\nKhulzond was dressed in rich clothes and a black cloak. His voice sounded like harsh and malevolent croak.\nKhulzond possessed all powers of a vampire of his great age. He could control vermin creatures with her will, and all vampires created by him were under the masters absolute control.\nKhulzond wielded a powerful +4 enchanted longsword, wore a +4 magical banded mail, and defended himself with a +4 shield and a powerful ring of protection.\nThe Skull Crag Keep once belonged to a vampire couple, aged around 1200 years by the 1360s DR. Khulzond and his consort Mordroka were forced out, and the Keep was taken by the Purple Dragons who later established the Roadwarden Guard. Both vampires survived the conflict and swore vengeance.\nBy the early 1360s DR, Mordroka and Khulzond accumulated power and influence among monsters who dwelled in the Storm Horns and the Tunlands. They also controlled vampires, some of whom still slumbered in an ancient mausoleum deep underneath the Skull Crag Keep, and a powerful beholder who aided the duo in their attempt to take back the Keep.\nThe vampires plot began with the disappearance of Vidruand Starbrow, the heroic son of the Roadwarden, Arelin Starbrow. Believed to be missing or dead, Vidruand was turned into Mordrokas vampire thrall. The bloodsuckers commanded Vidruand to join a force of monsters and slay his famous and much beloved mother. The heros death was imminent, but the plan was somewhat derailed when Vidruand lost most of the Arms of the Roadwarden to the monsters, only keeping the horned Helm of the Roadwarden. The Arms were not only symbols of the office but also a powerful set of artifacts from the Keep.\nA group of caravan guards joined Arelin Starbrows surviving children in defense of Skull Crag and the recovery of lost items. When two out of three Arms were returned to the Keep, Mordroka and Khulzond sent a vampire thrall named Keremish to kidnap Arelins husband, Vidruands father&mdashMorudel of Marsember, holding the man hostage, only returning him in exchange for the recovered Arms. However, that plot was ruined by the adventuring group, which aided the Keeps defense.\nWith the last attempt to claim the full set of Arms, Vidruand Starbrow revealed himself to the family and the defenders of the Keep, claiming that the adventurers were the ones who slew the Roadwarden Arelin. That lie was easily seen through, and the prodigal son revealed his vampiric nature to the defenders, attacking them with an army of giant rats and mobats. Vidruand was defeated and seemingly killed when two sinister dark figures floated into the Keeps Great Hall. Mordroka and Khulzond revealed themselves. Mordroka wielded her spells paralyzing the defenders and commanded her thrall Vidruand Starbrow back, forcing him to recompose out of mist back into the physical form. She willed the Arms of the Roadwarden to dart toward her servant, completing the set and getting ready to slay the Keeps defenders. However, Lunit Bdufe, a cleric of Sune, countered Mordrokas magic with the last of her strength, releasing the siblings, the adventurers, Sir Dutiocs, and pulling the Arms away from the vampire.\nAfter a battle between the vampires and the heirs of the Skull Crag Keep, the vampires were defeated. However, it was not recorded who took the mantle of the Roadwarden in the end. One thing was clear, however, Mordroka and Khulzond were repelled from Skull Crag but not destroyed, likely to menace the fort again."
