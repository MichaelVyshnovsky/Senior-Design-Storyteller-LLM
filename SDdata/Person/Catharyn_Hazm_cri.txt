Catharyn was a crinti pirate who lived in Dambrath.
Much to her mothers pride, Catharyn was cruel and ruthless. It was said that she never took prisoners on the open water.
Catharyn sailed the Great Sea on Queens Fury, her personal vessel. She raided the waters of the Great Sea and even ventured as far away as Nimbral on the Trackless Sea where she returned to Dambrath with four shiploads of booty.
Catharyn was Queen Yenandras oldest daughter.
