Eschar was a powerful demon bound by the Nar demonbinders of Narfell beneath Dun-Tharos to guard the Sighing Vault.
Eschar resembled an immense ogre with red skin and a crown of horns. He spoke with a brutish, hollow voice. His skin was scaled, and his horns radiated with fiendish witchlight his body pulsed with evil power.
Unlike other demons, Eschar actually relished the conditions of his binding. He was still bloodthirsty, ferocious, and proud.
Eschar was mainly a physical fighter, swinging fists and clawed feet. He commanded other demons, being able to freeze even the servants of the Queen Abiding by commanding them. He was also capable of teleporting himself from place to place, even outside of the Sighing Vault from time to time.
