'''Squammulsh''' was a [[mimic]] in [[Undermountain]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Activities==
Squammulsh was a mimic placed by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] in a prank trap in the Hall of Mirrors in the dungeon.

==Personality==
Squammulsh was more interested in eating than killing adventurers and preferred to eat normal food rather than [[human]] meat; in particular, it liked wine. If in danger, it begged for its life.
