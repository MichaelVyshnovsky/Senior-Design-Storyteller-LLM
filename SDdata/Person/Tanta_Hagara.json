        "mainbody": "Tanta Hagara was an evil annis who worked her way into the Blue Bear tribe of the Uthgardt.\nTanta stood  tall, had a muscular and wiry frame with deep blue skin, and dull greenish-yellow eyes. Her hair, teeth, and nails were all glossy black. She dressed in heavy, cowled robes that covered all her skin so as to avoid frightening her followers if caught in this form.\nWhenever she appeared before members of the Blue Bear tribe she would use disguise self to take on one of two formsâ€”a beautiful, barbaric hunter goddess with sky-blue skin or a blue-furred bear.\nTantas greatest known goal in life was to gain access to the Uthgardt ancestral mound that laid beneath the Grandfather Tree - an ancient embodiment of the forest, reputed to hold the Hall of Mists. She would often tell her Tanarri minions that these gates would allow them to bolster their army with more tanarri, creating an army large enough to conquer all of the North. Beyond the gates, she sought two artifacts that resided within the Hall of Mists - a crystal ball that projected the contents of a Book of Vile Darkness into its users mind and a mysterious extra-planar artifact.\nWhen not pursuing these goals she would often be found stalking the wilderness, either hunting for human prey or meeting with the demon Grintharke.\nA servant of the demon Grintharke, Tanta corrupted the Blue Bear tribe with base rituals while posing as their shaman. This corruption developed to such an extent that the tribe began to view her as an avatar of their totemic spirit, they were driven away from the Grandfather Tree by its guardian spirits, and they were shunned by the rest of the Uthgardt tribes. Those who did not accept her as their shaman splintered off, becoming the Tree Ghost tribe.\nFollowing Grintharkes death in 1365 DR, she acted as a servant to Hellgate Keeps new ruler, Mulvassyss.\nIn 1366 DR, a cambion from Hellgate Keep by the name of Kaanyr Vhok met with Tanta in the High Forest to discuss overthrowing his mother Mulvassyss. Two years later Kaanyr led Tanta and the Blue Bear tribe into the keep and slew his mother. The tribes puppet chieftain, Hlutwig Long-throw, was trampled to death in the confusion that followed.\nWith the death of their chieftain, the Blue Bear tribe turned to Tanta as their new leader and Kaanyr wed her to cement their alliance. Kaanyr would control the demonic forces of Hellgate Keep, while Tanta was left to act as its figurehead \"true ruler.\"\nA year later in 1369 DR, two Harpers infiltrated the city under the guise of Blue Bear barbarians and exposed Tantas existence as an annis, believing this would cause a riot among the tribesmen.\nLater that year Tanta would lead the tribe and their demon allies in an attack on the Citadel of the Mists. An alliance of Everlund, High Forest, and Harpers drove them back and ultimately killed Tanta along with a majority of the tribes members. She met her death at the hands of the treant Turlang the Great.\nIt was believed that before her death, Tanta Hagara enchanted Uthgardt burial totems to summon dead warriors of the Blue Bear tribe to defend the Stone Stand and all the hidden treasures deep underneath the ancestral mounds. Once such totem, the Wrath of the Blue Bear was stolen from the Stone Stand and found its way into a private collection in Daggerford."
