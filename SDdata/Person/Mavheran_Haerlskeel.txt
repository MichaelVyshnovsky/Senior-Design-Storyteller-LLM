'''Mavheran Haerlskeel''' was the clanlord of the [[gnomish]] hold called [[Graevelwood]], located within the [[Arn Forest]], during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She was known for being an experienced trapper and scout, as were many within her clan.

Her advisor was a [[wizard]] named [[Halvena Fallowfield]].

==Outlook==
Clanlord Haerlskeel had a fear that an inevitable war between the [[orc]] tribes would soon devastate their region. Due to this, she believed in keeping her people hidden from the rest of the [[Silver Marches]].
