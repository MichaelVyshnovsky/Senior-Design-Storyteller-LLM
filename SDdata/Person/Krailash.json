        "mainbody": "railash, sometimes known as Krai was a dragonborn fighter who served as guard captain and chief of security for the Travelers of the merchant House Serrat.\nKrailash was huge, standing nearly seven feet (2 meters) tall and weighing 300 lbs. (136 kg.).  He had rust colored scales.\nIn 1462 DR, Krailash was in the jungle guarding House Serrats terazul harvesters.  He decided to investigate old ruins said to be inhabited by yuan-ti and he found an apparently human infant in the jungle vegetation.  Believing the infant to be the last survivor of a massacre of a human tribe, he took her back to House Serrats camp and the child was adopted by Alaia Serrat and named Zaltys.\nLater, in 1479 DR, when Zaltys was nearly full grown, she learned that her tribe may have been enslaved by derro of the Underdark and she decided to enter the Underdark with her cousin Julen to find her people.  Zaltys and Julen were attacked by derro and Zaltys sent a psychic plea for help to Krai.  Krailash led a small party into the Underdark to find Zaltys.\nIn the Underdark, the party was nearly wiped out by swordwings with Krai and Alaia the only survivors.   With the help of the yuan-ti god Zehirs avatar, he and Alaia found the derro settlement where Zaltys and Julen had traveled to.  At the settlement, the group confronted the derros leader, the Slime King, and Krai pushed her through a portal to the Far Realm that the derro had opened.  Unfortunately, Krai also fell through the portal.\nCategoryDragonborn\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryThymari\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Southeast Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Delzimmer\nCategoryMembers of House Serrat\nCategoryMales\ncqx0n88hczb2niruybosknhn761ws8c"
