        "History": "In [[1462 DR]], Krailash was in the jungle guarding House Serrat's [[terazul]] harvesters.  He decided to investigate old ruins said to be inhabited by [[yuan-ti]] and he found an apparently human infant in the jungle vegetation.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|242}}  Believing the infant to be the last survivor of a massacre of a human tribe, he took her back to House Serrat's camp and the child was adopted by [[Alaia Serrat]] and named [[Zaltys Serrat|Zaltys]].\n\nLater, in [[1479 DR]], when Zaltys was nearly full grown, she learned that her tribe may have been enslaved by [[derro]] of the [[Underdark]] and she decided to enter the Underdark with her cousin [[Julen Serrat|Julen]] to find her people.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1405}}  Zaltys and Julen were attacked by derro and Zaltys sent a psychic plea for help to Krai.  Krailash led a small party into the Underdark to find Zaltys.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1733}}\n\nIn the Underdark, the party was nearly wiped out by [[swordwings]] with Krai and Alaia the only survivors.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|2122}}   With the help of the yuan-ti [[deity|god]] [[Zehir]]'s avatar, he and Alaia found the derro settlement where Zaltys and Julen had traveled to.  At the settlement, the group confronted the derro's leader, the [[Iraska|Slime King]], and Krai pushed her through a portal to the [[Far Realm]] that the derro had opened.  Unfortunately, Krai also fell through the portal.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3605}}",
