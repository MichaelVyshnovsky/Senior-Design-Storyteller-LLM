        "History": {
            "Life": "Feldrin hailed from [[Ravensburg]], the first settlement in what would become the lands of the Damaran [[Duchy of Carmathan]]. He was a nobleman of [[Sembia]]n heritage.\n\nHe was credited with founding the city of [[Heliogabalus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1075}}, and establishing it as the seat of his new Kingdom of Damara.",
            "Legacy": "Feldrin's lineage was much loved by the people of Damara, and his line ruled unbroken for nearly three hundred years. The last member of [[House Bloodfeathers]] died in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, when [[Virdin Bloodfeathers]] fell in battle with [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]], who then claimed the Damaran throne. By the time of the Witch-King's ouster two years later, only three direct descendants of Feldrin remained: [[Dimian Ree]], the Baron of [[Morov]]; [[Tranth]], the former Baron of [[Bloodstone (barony)|Bloodstone]]; and [[Christine Dragonsbane]], daughter of Tranth and wife to the then-Baron of Bloodstone, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]."
