'''Astanalan''' was an [[emerald dragon]] and one of the [[Princes of Murgh么m]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Astanalan was one of the princes of Murgh么m who participated in [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]''.

He was one of the dragons [[Alasklerbanbastos]] sought out to attack [[Luthcheq]] and destroy the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] after the [[dracolich]] and Brimstone discovered [[Aoth Fezim]] attempts to disrupt the ''xorvintaal''.

During the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], Astanalan was freed of the compulsion of the ''xorvintaal'' by the [[dragonborn]] [[paladin]] [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], he turned against Alasklerbanbastos and [[Tchazzar]].

He later went to [[Dracowyr]] alongside the Brotherhood of the Griffon, the dragonborn Medrash and [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]], and the surviving dragons of the Battle of Luthcheq. Together, they put an end to Brimstone's ''xorvintaal''.
