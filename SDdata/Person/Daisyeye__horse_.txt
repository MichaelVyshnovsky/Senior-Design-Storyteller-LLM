'''Daisyeye''' was a [[horse|mare]] owned by [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] of [[Immersea]] ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Giogioni Wyvernspur, a young nobleman from Immersea, had owned Daisyeye for some time before 1357 DR when he was forced to ride Daisyeye from [[Dimswart Manor]] back to Immersea after a wedding reception. The horse was spooked by something, and threw Giogi into roadside mud and galloped ahead. Shortly after, Giogioni found the poor horse being devoured by an ancient [[red dragon]], [[Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco]].
