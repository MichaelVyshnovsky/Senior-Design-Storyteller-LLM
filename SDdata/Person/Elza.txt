'''Elza''' was the shopkeeper that ran [[Blackiron Blades]] in [[Bryn Shander]], during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. She worked along side her brother [[Garn]], a smith of middling skill.

==Activities==
Elza spent much of her time expanding the Blackiron business, offering a wider variety of items for sale within the shop. She sold many goods that were essential for life in the frigid north, such as rations, cold-weather clothing, and equipment for traveling across snow and ice.

She sold these goods at a significant markup compared to the prices offered by other stores.
