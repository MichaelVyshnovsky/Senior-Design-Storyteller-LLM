Elza was the shopkeeper that ran Blackiron Blades in Bryn Shander, during the late 15 century DR. She worked along side her brother Garn, a smith of middling skill.
Elza spent much of her time expanding the Blackiron business, offering a wider variety of items for sale within the shop. She sold many goods that were essential for life in the frigid north, such as rations, cold-weather clothing, and equipment for traveling across snow and ice.
She sold these goods at a significant markup compared to the prices offered by other stores.
