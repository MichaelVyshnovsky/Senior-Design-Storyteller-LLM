'''Cellica''' was a [[halfling]] thief who lived in [[Waterdeep]] with her adoptive brother [[Kalen Dren]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].  

==History==
As a youth in [[Luskan]], Cellica worked as a thief for the same organization as Kalen. The two became very close and considered each other brother and sister. When Kalen met [[Gedrin Shadowbane]] and joined the [[Eye of Justice]], Cellica followed him to Waterdeep, where they lived together in a rowhouse. While Kalen performed his duties in the city guard, Cellica stayed home and tended house.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Kalen attempted to stop a plot by the high [[priest]] of [[Beshaba]] to kidnap a powerful [[spellscar|spellcarred]] [[wizard]] named [[Myrin Darkdance]]. A [[dwarf]] [[monk]] named [[Rath]] who was working for the high priest entered their house and stabbed Cellica to death.

==Abilities==
Although Cellica was not a [[spell]] caster, she had the power to use her voice to [[command]] others when she wanted to.
