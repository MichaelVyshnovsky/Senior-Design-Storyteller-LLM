        "mainbody": "'''Syndrith''' was the High Priestess of [[Lolth]] at the [[Temple of the Spider]] in the [[Northdark]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "While on most occasions Syndrith appeared drow priestess, she was capable of transforming into the form of a [[drider]].",
        "Relationships": "She was served by Lord [[Jevahn Jhalvar]] and his drow warriors that stood guard over the entranceway leading to her temple, as well as [[Halbryn Dark Stalker]], head of a band of drow [[assassin]]s.",
        "History": "Some time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Syndrith and her [[Deathweavers]] came into the possession of dark ritual that they sought to perform on behalf of their goddess [[Lolth]]. They began by creating some sort of interconnected energy field over the village of [[Rothé Valley Village|Rothé Valley]], as part of [[Sarkon'Iss]]' expedition to found the above-ground outpost of \"New Xorlarrin\", in order to control the wild arcane energy let loose by the [[Spellplague]] and shape it into a reformed version of [[the Weave]] that could be controlled by Lolth herself.\n\nWhile the formation of New Xorlarrin and the drow Deathweavers were thwarted by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], Syndrith continued their work at the Temple of the Spider within the Underdark. The hero and their [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|adventuring party]] ventured into the [[Shallows]] beneath [[Rothé Valley]], and stormed the temple, slaying Syndrith and preventing the perversion of the Weave that bound arcane magic on [[Toril]]."
