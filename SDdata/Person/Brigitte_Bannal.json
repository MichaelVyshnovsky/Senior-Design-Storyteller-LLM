        "mainbody": "'''Brigitte Bannal''' was a mage and ruler of the [[Realm of Lands]] in the [[Utter East]] during the time of the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]).\n\nBrigitte understood how to use the complex terrain to her strategic advantage, making nature effectively a fortress. At last, the leader of the [[Legendary Campaign]] came to the Realm of Lands to overcome these defenses and defeat her in [[bloodforge]] battle, as part of a plan to unify the war-torn Utter East through conquest."
