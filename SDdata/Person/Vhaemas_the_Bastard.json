Abandoned by his father, he came to hate him. \n\nIn [[Thuridru]], he married twice, producing five children ready to fight against those merfolk who banished them.\n\nAt the start of the Twelfth Serôs War, Vhaemas the Bastard allied with [[Iakhovas]] in order to conquer the [[ixitxachitl]] of the [[Xedran Reefs]]. However, Iakhovas attacked [[Eadraal]] and Vhaemas the Bastard was forced to meet King [[Vhaemas]] in battle. However, the two merfolk reconciled and attacked Iakhovas together, also helped by Princess [[Jian]]. They managed to destroy Iakhovas's trident but the monster killed the two younger merfolk and injured king Vhaemas.",
