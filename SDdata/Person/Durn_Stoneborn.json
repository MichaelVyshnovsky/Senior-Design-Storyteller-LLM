        "mainbody": "'''Durn Stoneborn''' was a passenger aboard the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' in [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "Durn was a solemn, heavily armed, and armored [[duergar]]. He was not keen on conversing and uttered not a word during the voyage on the ''Vigilant''. Durn used his trusty [[longsword]] in battle.",
        "History": "In the  {{Yearlink|1374}}, Durn Stoneborn was among the passengers aboard Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]]'s ''Vigilant'' that traveled from the [[Sword Coast]] to the nation of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Several passengers were onboard the ship, including renowned writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. The voyage was cursed with bad luck and culminated in a deadly storm. The ''Vigilant's'' shipwreck was washed ashore on [[Omgar's Teeth]], not far from the city of [[Samargol]]. Durn was among several survivors of the crash and faced a scavenging band of [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s on the beach shortly after the disaster."
