        "mainbody": "'''Ronger Delphos''' was a merchant and the founder of an anti-thieves' guild of [[Waterdeep]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Ronger Delphos attempted to create an antiâ€“thieves' guild in the City of Splendors by hiring [[thieves]] as security experts for his organization, which involved guarding Waterdhavian merchants. Ronger Delphos's recruits were armed with magic [[wand]]s that dispensed a ''[[hold person]]'' [[spell]]. To counter this, Waterdeep's thieves' guilds purchased many ''[[belts of agility]]''. This led to an escalation of the guild war between the thieves and Ronger Delphos's guards."
