{{quote
|You think that magic is a tool, like a hammer, something that you pick up when you need it, swing it around for a while, and put down again when you’re done with it. Not so. Magic is a living thing—part of the Lady of Mysteries, a deity to whom you only pay lip service. You can’t just grab onto her when you need magic, squeeze the power out of her, and discard her when you’re done. That sort of treatment comes back to you. There’s a reason why most old mages are obsessed or insane— Mystra punishes them for their lack of respect.

==Powers==
Mystra's secret was that she was more powerful than any god, save for [[Ao|Lord Ao]], but therein lay the secret. Roughly half of her power lay in her Chosen and in the lesser power [[Azuth]], as planned by Ao so that Mystra did not rule all [[Realmspace]].<ref>

Mystra wielded [[Silver fire]], a raw magic also available to her [[Chosen]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Mana}}

After the [[Second Sundering]], being spread across the [[Weave]] on [[Toril]] made Mystra much harder to find, and even harder to target. As the Lady of Spells, she was the source for other gods' spellcraft, making her normally immune to the direct effects of such spells, though not its after-effects.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-17/Mystra hiding in the Weave}} 

==Activities==
[[Dracolich]]es such as [[Daurgothoth]] would become her targets only at the moment they stepped beyond gathering magic (which she encouraged), and onto restricting it from others.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-03-11/Daurgothoth's view on dragonsight greatwyrmhood}} [[Azuth]] and Mystra were likewise wary of [[Ioulaum]] and his attempts at controlling the [[Weave]]. They allowed him only minor successes, so as to keep him away from his more nefarious plans.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-11/Ioulaum}}

Mystra and Azuth punished egregiously deceitful auctioneering of magical items, such as when an item was covertly exchanged for another, or was not magical to begin with.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-13/Magic item auctions}}

=== Divine Realm===
Mystra ruled over the divine [[dominion]] of [[Dweomerheart]].

However, no mortal was aware that after the [[Second Sundering]], Mystra abided within the [[Weave]]. In this way, she was ever-present & hidden across [[Toril]], able to create other-dimensional spaces for mortals or servants seeking audience.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-15/Location of Mystra's domain}}

Mystra's failsafe 'echoes' resided in Azuth's [[divine realm]] (also called [[Azuth (realm)|Azuth]]), within a royal castle and surrounded by blue mists. 

==Relationships==
Mystra's customary adviser was [[Azuth]] and she was also served indirectly by [[Savras]] and [[Velsharoon]]. Other allies of hers included [[Selûne]] and Kelemvor, whom she knew as a man when she was a mortal. Mystra's greatest enemies were [[Shar]], who created the [[Shadow Weave]] to oppose Mystra's Weave, and [[Cyric]], who was a mortal along with Mystra and [[Kelemvor]].

==Worshipers==
{{Quote|I speak into your Weave my supplication and faith, and hope the magics I hold are pleasing to your eye.|A basic prayer to Mystra.}}[[File:Mystran_holy_symbol_2.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[holy symbol]] of Mystra.]]
The church of Mystra preserved magical lore so that magic would continue and flourish in the future even if the dominant races of [[Faerûn]] were to fall. Its members also sought out those skilled in magic or who had the potential to use it, keeping a close eye on those who were likely to become skilled. Her [[cleric]]s were encouraged to explore magical theory and create new spells and magic items. Sites dedicated to the goddess were enhanced by the Weave to allow any spell cast by her clerics while in them to be affected by [[metamagic]]. Mystra honored commitments to members of her predecessor's clergy who'd joined the church before the [[Time of Troubles]], preventing them from being forced to leave the clergy due to alignment differences.

===Mystra's Chosen===

Mystra also had powerful mortal servants among her ranks of followers, including [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]], [[Khelben Arunsun]], and the [[Seven Sisters]].

Before her ascension to godhood, the third Mystra was a woman named Midnight, who, along with several other individuals, including Kelemvor, played a large role during the Avatar Crisis, also known as the Time of Troubles.

===Early Life===
Midnight, born '''Ariel Manx''' in [[1332 DR]], was the second child of [[Theus Manx]], a merchant, and his wife [[Paiyse]]. Midnight had an elder sibling named [[Rysanna]] who assumed the role of the family's demure "princess" whenever wealthy suitors called. As a teenager, Midnight became familiar with the night's populace of [[bard]]s, [[rogue|thieves]], [[sorcerer]]s, and [[fighter]]s and was eventually nicknamed "Midnight" by these friends, a name she immediately preferred to Ariel.

Midnight's first taste of magic began with her tryst with the [[Conjuration|conjurer]] [[Tad]], who set her on her path. She began to exhibit less interest in her hedonistic pursuits and more in the quest for magical knowledge and training, gradually becoming more obsessed with her magical quest. Eventually, Midnight moved out of the family home to seek her own path.

It was during this time that she fell into the worship of [[Mystra]], whose attention Midnight attracted during her time of service in one of Mystra's temples. From her 21st year on, Midnight began to feel a presence from time to time. She would feel her skin tingle coolly and began to feel that she was somehow being followed or observed. After such attentions, she always found that spells, which she had labored over for weeks, would suddenly work without any problem. Midnight soon suspected that she had been granted special attention by Mystra herself and believed that she was being groomed for the position of [[Magister]].

[[Sunlar]], high priest of the [[Deepingdale]] temple of Mystra, took Midnight under his supervision. It was during this time that Midnight's knowledge of self-defense and magic improved leaps and bounds and Midnight spent a year in the temple at Deepingdale before she left. For the next three years Midnight devoted herself to Mystra's worship and pursued every scrap of magic she could.

===Ascension===
{{main|Time of Troubles}}
[[File:Yawning Portal - Waterdeep.jpg|left|thumb|''Kelemvor and Midnight in Waterdeep'']]
During the Time of Troubles, when the gods were cast down by [[Ao]], Midnight joined with Kelemvor Lyonsbane, Cyric, and [[Adon]] in the search for the stolen [[Tablets of Fate]]. During this time, the previous Mystra was killed by the deity [[Helm]] for defying Ao's command and trying to climb the [[Celestial Stairway]] back to the [[Astral Sea|heavens]]. Her death caused great damage to the Weave, but eventually Ao selected Midnight to replace the destroyed Mystra, restoring the magic of [[Toril]]. Immediately prior to her ascension, Midnight killed [[Myrkul]], the god of death, in a duel in the skies over the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==="Death"===
{{main|Spellplague}}
Midnight was not long the goddess of magic and in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], Cyric supposedly murdered her, at the behest and with the aid of Shar, who sought to obtain control over the Weave. The results of Midnight's disappearance, however, were far worse than Shar had supposed it would be and the Spellplague soon followed, causing magic throughout the planes to go wild.<ref>{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Magic in the Forgotten Realms}}

In the beginning, only Mystra's temples knew that Cyric's slaying of her had ushered in the [[Spellplague]]. Soon after, it became well known that she had sacrificed herself to save everyone.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/The clergy of Mystra and the cause of the Spellplague}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1442}}, in the absence of Mystra, Azuth offered the position of [[Magister]] to [[Tannathra]] of [[Hardcastle]].{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/The Magister: A Look at the Mortal "Gunslinger" Mage of Mystra}}

===Resurrection===
[[Image:Mystra Symbol-5e.png|thumb|''Holy symbol of the resurrected Mystra.'']]
In the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR]], while recuperating in a cabin in the [[King's Forest]], Elminster felt Mystra's presence calling to him. He found her much diminished, possessing the body of a [[bear]] that had guarded a cache of items Mystra's still-mortal form had collected. She asked her most trusted servant to find new candidates to become Chosen and to recruit [[Cormyr]]'s [[War Wizard]]s.{{Cite digital book/Bury Elminster Deep/Kindle|170-235}}

Only a few weeks later, having been restored to his full powers as a Chosen by absorbing the ''[[silver fire]]'' of the dying [[Symrustar Auglamyr]]{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|405}} and then that of the [[Simbul]] and [[Manshoon]],{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|4836}} Elminster returned to Mystra (in agony from absorbing too much of it) and returned much of it to the Lady of Mysteries, restoring much of her power and divinity.{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|5142}} This event became known as [[Mystra's Return]].{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|5159}} But it was not until [[1487 DR]] that the goddess was whole again.

In the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, after conferring with Mystra, Azuth offered the office of Magister to [[Valargrim Hond]] upon Tannathra's voluntary retirement. In [[1496 DR]], [[Ramarthant Horaerays]] was offered the office by Azuth upon the death of Valargrim.
