Aurelia was a vampire spawn and one of the favorite "children" of the vampire lord Cazador Szarr, who resided in the Szarr Palace of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Aurelia was a female tiefling with crimson skin and black straight horns. Her eyes glowed with the typical sinister red color of a vampires gaze. Like her "siblings," Aurelias back was carved with infernal runes.
Like her "siblings," the purpose of Aurelias existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the . As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant. Aurelia believed that that ritual would instead let all of Cazadors "children" cheat death. Under her masters orders, Aurelia, alongside Violet, Yousen, and Leon Onufrio attempted to retrieve Astarion Ancun√≠n, after he and the Absolute Adversaries reached the city of Baldurs Gate. All of Cazadors spawn were needed for the ritual to succeed however, it was unknown if the Black Mass was successful and if Aurelia was destroyed, or if the Black Mass never was completed, leaving Aurelia freed from her dark master, or if she was slain in the process by the Absolute Adversaries and Astarion.
