'''Ulblyn Blackalbuck''' was the proprietor of [[Blackalbuck's Swap Shop]] within the city of [[Melvaunt]].

==Activities==
Along with trading equipment and goods, Ulblyn was always looking for information and tips for which to trade. The information Ulblyn gained could often be put to good use as he was the head operative for the [[Harpers]] within the city. He often got others to work for him with their goals in mind, particularly if he could strike a blow against the slave trade of the [[Moonsea]].
