Khedive Aman al-Qasi abu Nari was the ruler of Kadarasto in 1367 DR.
Aman held all of the personality traits that one would expect as the ruler of the "City Most Sinister." Sly and snakelike, Aman presented a pious demeanor to casual observers while harnessing the darkest of hearts. Aman excelled at manipulation. The poor class in Kadarasto feared him but saw his value as one to oppose foreign higher classes. The wealthy in Kadarasto disliked Aman but saw his a a necessity because of his army and his control over the lower classes.
Amans father was a lesser vizier of the Grand Caliph in Huzuz while his mother was a local noble of the Cities of the Ancients.
Amans only son was Nari ibn Aman.
It was rumored that Amans father was a member of the Brotherhood of the True Flame and his mother a priestess of Shajar.
