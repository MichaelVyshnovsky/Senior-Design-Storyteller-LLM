In [[667 DR]], Khyssoun was chosen as one of the members of the early [[Council of Twelve]].

He fought during the [[Weeping War]] and in a decisive battle in [[Ches 3]]â€“[[Ches 5|5]] of [[712 DR]] at [[Dlabraddath]], Khyssoun followed the Spell-Captain [[Paeris Haladar]], leading four companies of [[Akh'Faer]] and [[Akh'Velahr]] to attack the [[Army of Darkness]], believing he could end the war with a decisive victory. Instead, they found a trap and were all killed, including Paeris and Khyssoun. However, the Army also suffered a great loss.
