'''Vincent''' was an [[ox]] belonging to [[Elmar Barthen]] in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{Quote|''The ox's name is Vincent. I'll expect to see him and the cart returned, thanks.''|Elmar Barthen}}

==Description==
Elmar used Vincent to pull the wagons that transported supplies from his store, [[Barthen's Provisions]], to locations such as [[Tibor Wester's loggers' camp]].

==Personality==
Vincent was very reliable. He could pull a laden two-wheeled cart {{SI|24|miles|k|long=yes}} in a single day, even when travelling through [[Neverwinter Wood]].
