Vincent was an ox belonging to Elmar Barthen in Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.
Elmar used Vincent to pull the wagons that transported supplies from his store, Barthens Provisions, to locations such as Tibor Westers loggers camp.
Vincent was very reliable. He could pull a laden two-wheeled cart  in a single day, even when travelling through Neverwinter Wood.
