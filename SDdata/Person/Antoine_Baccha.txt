Lord Antoine Baccha, Vizier de Guise was a wereboar in the service of Halaster Blackcloak in Undermountain beneath Waterdeep.
Antoine was a stylish, wealthy man, with well-kempt black hair and a matching beard. He wore red clothes inlaid with gold patterns.
As a young man, he was known for his love of revelry, and his dashing manners. He feared growing old, especially since it meant an eventual end to his youthful carousing.
Antoine was a rich nobleman, the lord of a country estate. On a drunken night, he and his friends went on an ill-fated moonlit hunt, which ended with Antoine grievously injured by a boar. He found himself confined to his bed, and his reminder of the fleeting nature of his youth made Antoine deeply depressed. His father contacted the wizard Halaster, a family friend, to cheer up the young man. Halaster diagnosed Antoine with lycanthropy, contracted from the boar that gored him. Antoine confided in Halaster his fear of aging, and Halaster responded by offering him a potion of youth. With the potion came a warning that it would poison the young man, and that he would need to administer a cure every year to remain young and vital. Antoine agreed, and had his youthful strength restored by the potion.
As the centuries passed, Antoines circle of friends came to consist exclusively of other lycanthropes and shapeshifters. Meanwhile, Halaster grew mad over the years, withdrawing into the depths of Undermountain. As a result, Antoine moved himself and his retinue into the dungeon, so he could be closer to the cure he so depended on. Eventually, both Antoine and his followers came to miss the moonlit revelries of their past, something they could not experience while confined to Undermountain. Antoine sought the recipe for the cure, hoping to be able to brew his own and break his dependency on Halaster, and return to the surface.
