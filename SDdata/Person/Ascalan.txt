'''Ascalan''' was a man of the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. He was a [[wizard]] and [[fishmonger]], and owner of [[The Fish House]].

Once a wizard, Ascalan retired to become a fishmonger at The Fish House. He owned a ''[[ring of frost]]'', which he used to both refrigerate fish and create blocks of ice, both of which he sold to the people of Wheloon, and other merchants and travellers passing through. Occasionally, he also sold [[potion]]s, albeit at great cost.

By [[1369 DR]], he was old and rather portly. Ascalan enjoyed talking at length about adventurer's lore and lost treasure in Cormyr.

He had sons who helped him in his business.
