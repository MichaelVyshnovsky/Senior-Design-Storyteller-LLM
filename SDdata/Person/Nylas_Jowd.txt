Nylas Jowd was a Red Wizard of Thay who lived within Undermountain during the 15 century DR. He was a student at the magic academy known as Dweomercore, located within the dungeon-complex far beneath the city of Waterdeep.
Like the other Red Wizards, Nylas wore red wizards robes and kept his head shaved bald. Also like his countrymen, he possessed a certain disposition towards malevolence and evil. Nylas was particularly interested in anatomy and tended to view the living as future corpses that could be manipulated with necromancy.
As companions, the young wizard kept a pair of invisible will-o-wisps that accompanied him throughout his journeys.
In his studies, Nylas drew the ire and cruelty of the "Horned Sisters" of Dweomercore, Turbulence and Violence. He sought to have them killed so that he could reanimate their bodies as walking undead.
Among Nylass possessions was his personal spellbook, which was crafted from the wood of a coffin and the flesh of one or more humanoids. Its pages were inscribed with words written in Nylass own blood.
While he began his arcane studies in his homeland of Thay, Nylas eventually traveled west to Undermountain to study necromancy directly under the "Mad Mage" Halaster Blackcloak. Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, he enrolled in the arcane academy, Dweomercore, accompanied by his will-o-wisps.
