'''Erathaol''' ({{Pronounce|eh|rah|THAY|ohl|refs= His symbol was a [[dragon]]. Erathaol was a patron of seers and prophets and a great prophet himself, predicting events before their occurrence in the planes.

==Description==
Erathaol was a [[tome archon]]. white feathery wings, and a humanlike face. Technically without biological sex, he appeared with masculine traits, and he spoke in a deep voice.

Erathaol wore rich blue robes, which were decorated with arcane symbols stitched and sewn with silver thread and pearls.

==Abilities==
Erathaol had all of the powers common to tome archons. In addition to these, unique magical abilities were available to him. He could [[Water breathing|breathe under water]]. He could [[detect chaos]] and [[True seeing|see any creature as they truly were]]. By thought alone, he could [[consecrate]] an area with [[positive energy]], [[dispel evil]] and [[Greater dispelling|all but the most powerful magical effects]], [[hallow|make a site holy]], [[Prayer (spell)|bring the favor of the gods to his allies]], [[Ray of hope|instill hope in subjects within range]], [[Sending|send a short message to an individual anywhere in the multiverse]], [[Shield of the archons|defend himself with a mystical shield]], [[Sword of conscience|fill an evil creature with intense feelings of remorse]], and grant a subject a [[Vision of heaven|vision of the Seven Heavens]]. With a single, spoken [[holy word]], he could slay or banish wicked beings, and he could [[Message|whisper messages]] to recipients at a distance.

Once a day, Erathaol could perform a [[miracle]]. Three times per day, he could [[Moment of prescience|grant someone special insight toward any task.]]

Erathaol's true powers were in his prophetic giftings. He had truly great celestial knowledge, such that it was said that he knew of all lore and legends and could [[analyze dweomer]]s in moments. He was impossible to surprise or catch off-guard because of his [[foresight]].

==Personality==
The Seer was both regal and wise. He despised combat, as did most [[Celestial archon|archons]].

==Possessions==
Erathaol bore an ornate and magical [[holy (weapon quality)|holy]] [[quarterstaff]] that was [[flaming]] at one end and covered in [[Frost (property)|frost]] at the other.

He dwelt in the library fortress of [[Xiranthador]], a vast library of knowledge located under the sea.

==Activities==
Erathaol spent his time in his great library watching the multiverse unfold in time, paying special attention to children that he knew had great destinies.

==Relationships==
One of Erathaol's champions was Olythartu, an [[aasimar]] woman whom the Seer foresaw as fated for amazing things. For many years, he appeared to her in disguise and taught her before one day finally revealing his true nature to her.

One of Erathaol's favored [[sword archon]] servants was Melevon, and this servant was sent to deliver many messages for the Hebdomad to mortals in the [[Outlands]] or the [[Prime Material Plane]].

==History==
After the death of [[Mystra]], Erathaol summoned the [[astral deva]] diviner [[Eirwyn]] from her imprisonment in order to facilitate her visions. This action ultimately led to Eirwyn aiding [[Tauran]] and his companions in defending the [[Lifespring]] from [[Kaanyr Vhok]].
