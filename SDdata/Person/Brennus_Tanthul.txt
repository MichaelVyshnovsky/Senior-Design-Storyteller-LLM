Prince Brennus Tanthul was the youngest of the twelve Princes of Shade sired by High Prince Telamont Tanthul, and one that played an important role in the early years of the Second Sundering in the late 15 century DR, and eventually the second collapse of Sakkors.
Brennus had eyes the color of iron, highlighted with just a bit of orange. He laso had a rather large, crescent-shaped mouth.
When addressing others, Brennus conducted himself in a formal and cordial manner.
Brennus displayed great skill with arcane magic and was a prodigious scholar of history, particularly that of ancient Netheril. He served as Thultanthars resident lore-keeper on the culture and history of the Shadovar people along with the historical origins of the City of Shade itself.
The princes personal sigil included a trio of mountaintops above which sat a sphere of silver, all set on a field of ochre brown.
In service of his father and his people, Brennus helped locate the remnants of ancient Netheril and ordered expeditions to recover long-lost knowledge and artifacts of his peoples "ancestors". He believed that old arcane power concealed in these ruins held the key to the success of Netherils return on Faerûn.
It was observed by some that Brennus was among the favored of Telamont Tanthuls children. High Prince Tanthul arranged for his youngest son to receive the finest education possible, with a focus on the history of their people. Brennus held his father partly at fault for the death of his own mother Alashar, believing Telamont should have taken a stance against the elder prince Rivalen as he slew Alashar in the name of the goddess Shar.
By the end of the Era of Upheaval, Brennus was accompanied nearly at all times by his two homunculi constructs.
When the Princes of Shade returned to Faerûn in the , Brennus and his elder brothers Lamorak and Yder appeared before the Bedine tribespeople camped near the Shoal of Thirst. They tried to warn the humans about the upcoming changes that would take hold over the desert landscape but were perceived as devils or djinn by the superstitious Bedine, taking on the local witch Ruha as a guide. Afterwards, Brennus accompanied Clariburnus to the lair of the great blue dracolich Malygris, freed it from bondage to the Cult of the Dragon, and made a new ally for the emerging conflict between Thultanthar and the people of the Heartlands.
Brennus died in the , when Sakkors crashed on the city of Ordulin. Brennus held his brother Rivalen down during the disaster, finally taking revenge for the death of their mother Alashar. After Brennus death, his pair of homunculi were taken in by Telamont in a final act of tenderness to his favored younger son.
