Upon his death, Takosh-Re was buried in the manner of other pharaohs, being succeeded by his son, Amun-Re.\n\nWhen the younger pharaoh heard that his father's tomb may have been looted, he headed there alone. He became enraged and horrified by the desecration; this made Amun-Re vow that his tomb would be theft-proof, so that he could not be cheated of his place in Heaven Westward.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|42}}"
