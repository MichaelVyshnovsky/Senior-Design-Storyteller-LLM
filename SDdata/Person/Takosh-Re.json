        "mainbody": "Takosh-Re was a pharaoh from the dynasty of Mo-Pelar and the father of Amun-Re.\nPer the Book of Amun-Re, Amun-Res father told him of the power of the waters of Athis, which they considered the very gift of Isis, while Amun-Re was young. Upon his death, Takosh-Re was buried in the manner of other pharaohs, being succeeded by his son, Amun-Re.\nWhen the younger pharaoh heard that his fathers tomb may have been looted, he headed there alone. He became enraged and horrified by the desecration this made Amun-Re vow that his tomb would be theft-proof, so that he could not be cheated of his place in Heaven Westward."
