Baloreik was an evil drow adventurer.
Baloreik was clad in ornamented armor, with a horned helmet atop his head, and a flowing, red cloak fastened to his back. His skin was dark, nearly green in complexion.
In addition to his drow-style clothing and armor, Baloreik owned a cloak of the bat and a vorpal sword +5.
He was a seasoned adventurer, having traveled far and wide. On one trip to the Astral Plane, Baloreik killed a githyanki and looted its vorpal sword. Following this, Baloreik avoided returning to the Astral Plane.
Eventually, he fought Gort Taalen, scion of a lesser noble house of Menzoberranzan.
