'''Filzaur''' was a male [[drow]] [[wizard]] and a student of the [[Inverted Tower]] in [[Szith Morcane]].

==Description==
An average-looking male [[drow]], Filzaur distinguished himself by his atypical attire among drow society. He wore gaudy attire of greens and yellows, typically sporting black [[boot]]s and [[trousers]], an emerald-green shirt, and a yellow [[sash]] around his waist. If he had cause to leave the Inverted Tower (a rare occurrence), Filzaur wore a large black [[cloak]] over his lighter garments.

==Personality==
Filzaur was particularly studious and tended to isolate himself to his room in the [[Inverted Tower]] where he could focus on creating vile ''[[bestow curse|curses]]''.

==Abilities==
A skilled [[wizard]] and the apprentice of [[Solom Ned'razak]], Filzaur had researched many [[spell]]s that caused [[disease]]s or inflicted [[curse]]s on a victim. In addition, he had studied [[alchemy]] and could create a number of [[magic|magical]] [[potion]]s.

==Possessions==
As an apprentice of the Inverted Tower, Filzaur was denied many possessions owing to the policy of austerity that his master, Solom, enforced. However, he did keep a leather-bound [[spellbook]] in his room and wore a set of ''[[bracers of armor]]'' and a ''[[ring of protection]]''.

==Relationships==
Filzaur usually kept to himself but had a cordial enough relationship with the other members of the [[Inverted Tower]] to study alongside them communally.

==History==
As an apprentice of the [[archmage]], Solom Ned'razak, in the Inverted Tower, Filzaur had spent many years studying the art of wizardry. In [[1372 DR]], Filzaur was present when [[House Morcane]] fell to [[Kiaransalee]]an cultists and the refugees from [[Maerimydra]] arrived. Despite these disturbances to [[Szith Morcane]]'s society, Filzaur and the rest of his colleagues in the Inverted Tower were left largely unaffected.
