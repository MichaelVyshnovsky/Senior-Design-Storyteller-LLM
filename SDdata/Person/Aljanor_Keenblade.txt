'''Aljanor Keeblade''' was a knight and member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], Ajanor was captured by the [[drow]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] during one of their surface raids, but all believed him to have been killed in the fighting. He remained a prisoner of the drow until some [[adventurer]]s hired by [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] arrived to investigate the threat of [[demon lord]]s. [[Ryzliir Symryvvin]] threatened to kill Ajanor if the adventurers did not leave.

==Personality==
Aljanor had made his peace with [[Tyr]] and was ready to die at the drow's hands. He would be disappointed if good lives were lost because of him.
