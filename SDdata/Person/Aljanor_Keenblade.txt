Aljanor Keeblade was a knight and member of the Order of the Gauntlet in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1486 DR, Ajanor was captured by the drow of Menzoberranzan during one of their surface raids, but all believed him to have been killed in the fighting. He remained a prisoner of the drow until some adventurers hired by Bruenor Battlehammer arrived to investigate the threat of demon lords. Ryzliir Symryvvin threatened to kill Ajanor if the adventurers did not leave.
Aljanor had made his peace with Tyr and was ready to die at the drows hands. He would be disappointed if good lives were lost because of him.
