Uruma was the oyabun of the Worthless Flower yakuza gang in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Uruma directed all the operations of his gang from his veranda. Thanks to his prized cap of telepathy, his underlings never knew when he saw inside their minds and what operations were underway, so they depended heavily on Uruma.
Uruma was targeted by the tigbanua buso Getsu as the perfect vessel to spread his infection.
Urumas shrewd brain compensated for the weakness of his old body. However, he was still capable of fighting.
