Lord '''Dyrr''', commonly known as '''Lichdrow Dyrr''' or simply '''the Lichdrow''' and also called "Old Dyrr" or "Master Dyrr", was a [[drow]] [[lich]] and the ''de facto'' ruler of [[House Agrach Dyrr]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] and the power behind [[Yasraena Dyrr]]'s throne.{{fact}}

In addition to his great magical and political power, the Lichdrow had lived for at least two millennia, and he was once shown to contemplate his possible ascension to divinity in the future. Thus, before his death, he was probably one of the most powerful magic users in the [[Underdark]]. His only rivals in power, in fact, were possibly the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]] himself&mdash;[[Gromph Baenre]]&mdash;and [[Jalynfein]] the Spider Mage.{{fact}}{{Speculation}}

==Description==
The Lichdrow used his magic to appear as a normal male drow,{{Cite dragon/312/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of the War of the Spider Queen, Part 2|82}} He kept up his fa√ßade even when around most members of his family.

==Abilities==
Lord Dyrr could read minds and possessed all the abilities that one would expect of a lich.

As a [[cleric]] of Velsharoon he had access to [[spell]]s of the [[Death domain|Death]] and [[Undeath domain]]s. The spells that he typically had prepared as a cleric were ''[[cure minor wounds]]'', ''[[deathwatch]]'', ''[[detect undead]]'', ''[[guidance]]'', ''[[mending]]'', and ''[[sanctuary]]''.

As of [[1372 DR]], the [[sorcerer]] spells that Dyrr knew  encompassed the following:
: ''[[acid splash]]'', ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[analyze dweomer]]'', ''[[circle of death]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[daze]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect scrying]]'', ''[[detect secret doors]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[disrupt undead]]'', ''[[energy drain]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[finger of death]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[horrid wilting]]'', ''[[imprisonment]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[greater invisibility]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[mage hand]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', ''[[polymorph]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[resist energy]]'', ''[[resistance]]'', ''[[scorching ray]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]'', ''[[summon monster V]]'' and ''[[summon monster VIII]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[true seeing]]'', ''[[wish]]'' and ''[[limited wish]]''.

==Possessions==
As a powerful magic user that had lived for over two millennia, Lord Dyrr had amassed a great deal of magical items. Several of which he crafted himself. He also had access to the entire armory of House Agrach Dyrr.

Items that were unique to him included the ''[[crown of sorcerous terror]]'', his own [[Dyrr's impervious vestment|''impervious vestment'']], a ''+4 [[Animated object|animated]] [[mithral]] [[buckler]]'' known as the ''[[spiteful imp]]'', and the ''[[staff of mastery]]''. He also owned a [[spellbook]] that consisted of [[copper]] sheets and bone leaves. 

Some more general items that Dyrr possessed included a ''[[drow house insignia]]'', a ''[[belt of giant strength]] +4'', a pair of ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', a pair of ''[[gloves of dexterity]] +6'', a single [[gloves of storing|''glove of storing'']], a ''[[mirror of mental prowess]]'', a ''[[piwafwi]] of [[resistance]] +5'', a ''[[ring of protection]] +5'', a ''[[ring of wizardry]] IV'', a ''[[wand of inflict critical wounds]]'', and the ''[[staff of withering]]''. The last one of which was considered to be his favorite weapon that he carried at all times.

==History==
By [[1372 DR]], Lord Dyrr was over 2,000 years old.

During the [[Silence of Lolth]], as the priestesses of [[Lolth]] and the matriarchal society that they ruled were weakened and exposed, the Lichdrow visited the Archmage of Menzoberranzan, [[Gromph Baenre]], to encourage him to join the revolution spurred by the male-led [[Jaezred Chaulssin]]. Dyrr suggested that together they could overthrow the priestesses and turn Menzoberranzan into some kind of (possibly patriarchal) magocracy. Gromph Baenre refused, and the two most powerful wizards of Menzoberranzan were left on opposing sides. Several lengthy spell battles ensued. One of these battles led to Gromph's [[imprisonment]].

Gromph Baenre was eventually victorious. Due to the Lichdrow's ability to regenerate at his phylactery, however, he ultimately remained undefeated. With his sister [[Triel Baenre]]'s help, Gromph infiltrated House Agrach Dyrr and destroyed the Lichdrow's phylactery, which was cunningly hidden in House Agrach Dyrr's temple's guardian [[golem]] and protected by many powerful defenses. As a last revenge, however, the Lichdrow had weaved the master ward of House Agrach Dyrr such that if his phylactery was destroyed, an explosion of gigantic proportions would ensue, while a dimensional lock prevented magical escape (and physical escape would be impossible because the distance that would have to be covered in the short time between activation of the ward and explosion). Gromph Baenre, however, escaped with a contingency spell he had placed upon his person prior to his infiltration of House Agrach Dyrr, leaving the Lichdrow finally and comprehensively destroyed.
