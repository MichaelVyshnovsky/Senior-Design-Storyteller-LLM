'''Boult''' was a [[dwarf]] who was imprisoned for treason in [[Tethyr]] during the mid-15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|He's dead idiot. I was the only one who saw the ogres kill him. When they asked, I told everyone the ogres had killed Amhar and from then on I was Boult|[[Amhar]], speaking of Boult.}}

==History==
Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, Boult was imprisoned in [[Vankila Slab]] for "treason", or as a fellow prisoner described it: interfering with the business of some nobleman. While in prison, Boult was slain by the Vankila Slab's [[ogre]]s that served as its prison guards.

Boult's identity was assumed by the disgraced royal guardsmen [[Amhar]], convicted perpetrator of the [[Children's Massacre]], and the villainous murderer who was hated throughout all of Tethyr.
