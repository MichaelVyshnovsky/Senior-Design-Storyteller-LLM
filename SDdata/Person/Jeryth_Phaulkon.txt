By 1367 DR, Jeryth was believed missing or killed near Luskan as a result of the same caravan raid that took the life of her mother. This massacre was performed by the Hoar Fang tribe of gnolls due to the schemes of a doppelganger member of the Unseen seeking to gain information about the noble family.
