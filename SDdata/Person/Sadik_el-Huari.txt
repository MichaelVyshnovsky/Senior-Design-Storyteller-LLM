Sadik el-Huari was a Zakharan coffee trader in Yeoman on the plane of Bytopia.
He was a dark-skinned man.
Sadik was a haggling enthusiast, and would reward skilled customers with free cups of coffee.
He sold coffees and teas from a variety of planes, including popular varieties such as "Krigala Supreme" from the Beastlands, "Mountain Majesty" from Mount Celestia, as well as "Devotion" and "Purity" from Elysium.
His tent in Yeomans Bazaar was strewn with pillows and low tables, and was a popular site for business dealings among the local elite, including Mayor Lizabet the Seer.
For business reasons, Sadik displayed the symbol of the Order of the Planes-Militant, but was not himself a supporter of that organization.
