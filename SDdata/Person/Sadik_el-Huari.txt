'''Sadik el-Huari''' was a [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] [[kaeth|coffee]] trader in [[Yeoman]] on the plane of [[Bytopia]].

==Description==
He was a dark-skinned man.

==Personality==
Sadik was a haggling enthusiast, and would reward skilled customers with free cups of coffee.

==Activities==
He sold coffees and teas from a variety of [[Cosmology|planes]], including popular varieties such as "Krigala Supreme" from the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], "Mountain Majesty" from [[Mount Celestia]], as well as "Devotion" and "Purity" from [[Elysium]].

His tent in Yeoman's [[Bazaar (Yeoman)|Bazaar]] was strewn with pillows and low tables, and was a popular site for business dealings among the local elite, including Mayor [[Lizabet|Lizabet the Seer]].

For business reasons, Sadik displayed the symbol of the [[Order of the Planes-Militant]], but was not himself a supporter of that organization.
