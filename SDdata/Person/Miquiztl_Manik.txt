'''Miquiztl Manik''' (roughly meaning "hand of death") was a [[Jaguar Knight]] of [[Kultaka]] in [[Maztica]] who led the [[Jaguar Guard]] mercenary company operating in [[Myratma]] in [[Tethyr]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
After the Kultakans aided in the [[Golden Legion]]'s conquest of [[Nexal]] in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, the leaders of Kultaka realized the continent of Maztica had been opened to foreign explorers and invaders. Therefore, they sent a group of their Jaguar Knights, led by Miquiztl Manik, to [[Faerûn]] to learn more about this new continent. [[Gar Hollan]], a Myratman merchant, gave them transport and promised glorious battle if they went to Tethyr to fight as mercenaries for the Council of Myratma.

After nearly the entire Council was assassinated by [[Four|the Four]] in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, as part of the rise to power of [[Yusuf Jhannivvar]], more than half of the Guard were also slain. Miquiztl had his warriors join the [[Loyalist Army]] of [[Zaranda Star]]. They battled the forces of the Pretender Prince, both by themselves and with the Loyalists.

After the end of the [[Reclamation Wars]] in [[1369 DR]], the Jaguar Guard moved to garrisons around the ancient ruins of [[Shoonach]] and helped defend Tethyr against that evil place. They were still based in Myratma around [[1372 DR]].<ref>

==Abilities==
Miquiztl was a talented warrior and tactician. As a Jaguar Knight, he had various magical powers, such as transforming into a [[jaguar]] and enchanting stone weapons with ''[[talonblade]]''. He fought with [[maca]] and [[shield]] and wore distinctive jaguar-skin armor.

==Personality==
Miquiztl hoped to acquire land in Faerûn that they could settle and bring family and allies over from Maztica.
