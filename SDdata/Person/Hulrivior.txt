Hulrivior was a Red Wizard of the midâ€“14 century DR.
His voice was dry.
He had a number of underlings working with him in Triel. One of them had hired Marlel at some point, per Marlel himself.
Hulrivior was also aware of numerous players in the Realms, including Thoadrin, Rendilar Bluthlock, Tornar the Eye, Drauthtar Inskirl, Eirhaun Sooundaeril, Hesperdan, and Aumlar Chaunthoun. He was also familiar with Pheldred, and a few others, though he was not familiar with Sharantyr.
Whether by spell or something else, the table Hulrivior used for his final meeting had a blue flame free-floating above head level for those seated at it.
Hulrivior was in Triel as of .
When Orthil Voldovans caravan, of which the spellfire wielder Shandril Shessair was a passenger stopped at Triel, Hulrivior held a briefing regarding what was known of the caravan. During the briefing, he was introduced to Marlel and, after offering to capture spellfire for them, ambushed them by hurling an enspelled gem into the flame at the middle of their table. That caused an explosion killing most of the mages to Marlels understanding, wherever Hulrivior got to, he would be "highest" no more.
Hulriviors name was whispered as far as Scornubel.
