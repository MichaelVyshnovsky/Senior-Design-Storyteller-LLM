'''Hulrivior''' was a [[Red Wizard]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
His voice was dry.

==Relationships==
He had a number of underlings working with him in [[Triel]]. One of them had hired [[Marlel]] at some point, per Marlel himself.

Hulrivior was also aware of numerous players in the Realms, including [[Thoadrin]], [[Rendilar Bluthlock]], [[Tornar]] the Eye, [[Drauthtar Inskirl]], [[Eirhaun Sooundaeril]], [[Hesperdan]], and [[Aumlar Chaunthoun]]. He was also familiar with [[Pheldred]], and a few others, though he was not familiar with [[Sharantyr]].

==Possessions==
Whether by spell or something else, the table Hulrivior used for his final meeting had a blue flame free-floating above head level for those seated at it.

==History==
Hulrivior was in Triel as of {{yearlink|1357}}.

When [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan, of which the ''[[spellfire]]'' wielder [[Shandril Shessair]] was a passenger stopped at [[Triel]], Hulrivior held a briefing regarding what was known of the caravan. During the briefing, he was introduced to [[Marlel]] and, after offering to capture spellfire for them, ambushed them by hurling an enspelled [[gem]] into the flame at the middle of their table. That caused an explosion killing most of the mages; to Marlel's understanding, wherever Hulrivior got to, he would be "highest" no more.

==Rumors & Legends==
Hulrivior's name was whispered as far as [[Scornubel]].{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|287|17}}
