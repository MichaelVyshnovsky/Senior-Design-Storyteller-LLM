'''Geraq''' was the leader of the [[Swivelback]] [[goblin]] of [[Faerûn]] some centuries before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Chief Geraq was a somewhat legendary goblin leader. He rose to power, by some accords, thanks to his talent for strategy or, according to other legends, for being able to feed his tribe on the raid spoils for weeks, while others attributed his leadership to knowledge of obscure and helpful lore. However, in truth, Geraq led his tribe with the aid of a special type of ''[[ioun stone]]'' – ''[[scarlet-blue ioun stone|scarlet-blue]]'', which the goblin procured by some mysterious means and never parted with. Eventually, Chief Geraq disappeared from the pages of history books, but the magic stone continued whispering his knowledge in the [[Goblin language|tongue of the goblins]] to anyone who held it in their hand.
