Alexander Ralisar was one of the Bhaalspawn who lived in the Realms during the 14 century DR.
For most of his life, Alexander lived in the land of Sembia. Around the time of the Bhaalspawn crisis, Alexanders home was incinerated by a dragon that was specifically hunting for him.
Alexander fled west to the nation of Tethyr, settling in the city of Saradush. He was still in the city when it was destroyed by his fellow Bhaalspawn Yaga-Shura.
