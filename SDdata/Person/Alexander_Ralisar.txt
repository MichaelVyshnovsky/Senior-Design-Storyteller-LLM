'''Alexander Ralisar''' was one of the [[Bhaalspawn]] who lived in the Realms during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
For most of his life, Alexander lived in the land of [[Sembia]]. Around the time of the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]], Alexander's home was incinerated by a [[dragon]] that was specifically hunting for him.

Alexander fled west to the nation of [[Tethyr]], settling in the city of [[Saradush]]. He was still in the city when it was destroyed by his fellow Bhaalspawn [[Yaga-Shura]].
