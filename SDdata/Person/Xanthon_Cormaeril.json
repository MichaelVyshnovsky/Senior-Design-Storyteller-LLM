        "mainbody": "human\nXanthon Cormaeril was a member of the Cormaeril noble family of Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He became the sixth ghazneth, called Xanthon the Baneful and the Scourge of Swarms.\nXanthon was one of House Cormaerils more adventurous youths. He traveled the Heartlands in search of wealth and excitement, and in the process often irritated a foreign merchant or monarch to the point that his family needed to use its influence to free him from foreign justice.\nAfter Gaspar Cormaerils involvement in the abraxus affair and failed coup in 1369 DR, the Cormaeril family was stripped of land and title, with several members being imprisoned or put to death. Xanthon swore to have revenge on King Azoun IV and betrayed his realm, and thereby turned into a ghazneth. In 1370 DR, he unleashed the buried scourges to destroy Cormyr.\nAs a ghazneth, Xanthon had surprising speed and power, which allowed him to overwhelm and kill Emperel Ruousk, along with many other victims. Xanthon had the power to control swarms of poisonous creatures, from wasps and scorpions to even large snakes."
