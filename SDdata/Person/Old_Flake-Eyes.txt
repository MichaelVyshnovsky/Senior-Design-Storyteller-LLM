'''Old Flake-Eyes''' was a [[hunter]] [[ranger]] thug who opposed [[the Guild]] crime gang of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Old Flake-Eyes was a [[dragonborn]] whose scale coloration betrayed their [[copper dragon]] ancestry. The ranger wore a set of [[leather armor]] and handled a [[bow]].

==Abilities==
As a copper dragonborn, Old Flake-Eyes could breathe out a puff of [[acid]] and as an experienced ranger, had access to several [[spell]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], [[Farlin]] led a gang of Guild members in dealing with the [[Stone Lord]] and his men. The new kingpin secretly served the [[Absolute]] and was trying to remove the Guild's influence from across the Gate. Farlin's group faced a band of the Stone Lord's men led by the [[tiefling]] [[Cairos]], including Old Flake-Eyes. They clashed under the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge in [[Rivington]] over a shipment of supplies. However, the meeting devolved into a battle and either squads' fates remained uncertain.
