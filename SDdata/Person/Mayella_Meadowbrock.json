        "mainbody": "ayella Meadowbrock was an inhabitant of the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nMayella was poetically described by Jasper as \"the fairest flower in Cormyr\", with \"hair as golden as corn silk\" and \"eyes as blue as the Dragonmere in summer\" and lips as red as something quite red.\nShe was the daughter of Barthelm Meadowbrock, the wealthiest merchant of Ghars. That fact, combined with her good looks, made her seem quite the catch to many men in town However, it seemed she had her heart only on Rolf, a local roofer whod been a friend since childhood, but her father disapproved.\nShe owned a small lap dog named Muzlim.\nAs for her personality, she was said to have a marvelous one, but she was often subdued in the presence of her overbearing father.\nMayella went with her father Barthelm and her dog to the Bold Bard tavern on the night of Eleint 16, the . There, Muzlim growled and snapped at Mayor Tobald and Mayella chided the dog, before kings envoy Grodoveth made a crude advance that upset Mayella and angered Barthelm. Not long after, Dovo came to pester her as well, and also scared Muzlim, but Rolf intervened. The two got into a tavern brawl and Barthelm ordered Mayella out of there.\nWhen the Grand Council of the Merchants Guild arrived in Ghars on Eleint 19, for a meeting hosted by Barthelm, Mayella presented each council member with a ceremonial food and drink of welcome (elven bread from Evermeet and fresh water in a silver goblet) and a sampling of local produce and crafts. At the welcoming dinner that evening, she helped serve food, making the oyster and wild rice unreasonably popular. After midnight, she was forced to go with Barthelm and other townsfolk to Benelaiuss cottage, where he exposed the murderer of Dovo and Grodoveth. However, she was no more than a witness while Barthelm and Rolf were cleared of involvement. She also patted Benelaiuss cats."
