        "mainbody": "Rothglar Illance was a heir of House Illance in the late 15 century DR.\nHe was darkly handsome.\nHe showed more self-control when his father was around.\nHe was the eldest son of Velyandra Illance and Daeclander Illance, and had stretched the mans patience as far as it would go. Rothglar had eight brothers, per Arclath Delcastle. He had made a rival of Marlin Stormserpent. His bodyguard was named Marlazander the Mighty.\nRothglar attended a feast in early Mirtul of the , in which he was seen by Amarune Whitewave listening close into some private converse.\nBefore the night when Marlin Stormserpent retrieved the Wyverntongue Chalice from the Royal Palace of Suzail, hed bribed Verrin, one of Marlins servants, and the disloyal man waited for Marlin at the end of the passage the latter used to get out of the castle. Marlazander was there with him they had not unlocked the gate and were waiting for him. Marlin killed them too quickly, even from behind the bars, to learn what their intentions had been.\nThere was a rumor, actually a manipulation by Marlin Stormserpent, that Rothglar, alongside Harmond Hawklin and Seszgar Huntcrown, were planning to unleash a some sort of \"ball of Spellplague\" from a chest during the Council of the Dragon."
