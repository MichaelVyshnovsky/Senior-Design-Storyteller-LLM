==History==
In his youth, Shandrath killed or tamed many [[dragon]]s, earning his moniker, "Wyrmhumbler".

He arrived in Athalantar in old age and usually stayed alone in his [[Wyrm Tower]]. When the Stag King [[Uthgrael Aumar]] died in [[216 DR]], Shandrath kept an eye on his son [[Elthryn Aumar]], considered to be the best choice for the kingdom. At the same time, he tried to ruin the plots of the other princes, especially [[Belaur Aumar]] and his [[magelord]]s.

Finally, in [[222 DR]], a large group of magelords attacked the Wyrm Tower and in a massed spell-attack Shandrath died, but took many magelords with him.
