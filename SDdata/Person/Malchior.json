        "mainbody": "Malchior, usually known as Malchior of Darkhold, was a cleric of Cyric and a member of the Zhentarim in Waterdeep in 1372 DR.\nMalchiors first and foremost loyalty was to himself, his god a distant second. His greed was matched only by his cunning. Malchior was a master manipulator who loved twisting others to his will.\nMachior had great influence over Dag Zoreth and Gareth Cormaeril thanks to a combination of blackmail and charisma.\nMalchior was a Zhent of Darkhold sent to Waterdeep. By 1372 DR, he rarely went back to his home, where the Church of Bane had become more and more dominant."
