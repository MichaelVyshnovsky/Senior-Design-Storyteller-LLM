'''Marjon''' was a [[half-dragon]] son of the [[dracolich]] allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Pelendralaar]], ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
Marjon was a mountain of a man, {{SI|6'7|ft-in|long=yes}} tall. His appearance could be considered to be vaguely reptilian, with elongated facial features, and large draconic teeth. His skin was of unmistakable red hue and hands ended with long black hooked claws.

==Personality==
Marjon had a foul temper, the result of his red dragon lineage. He often blew up steam by incinerating things within his chambers. His draconic appetite was a strain on human kitchens of the Cult, and his overall attitude was unpleasant and confrontational.

Despite his personality flaws, Marjon was brave and smart. He often enjoyed brawls, which he always won. However if faced with infiltrators within the cult who could overpower him, the half-dragon did not hesitate to order fellow cultists to join the battle or call for aid.

==Abilities==
Like other half-dragons, Marjon could produce a devastating cone of fire from his mouth once a day, his [[red dragon]] [[dragon breath|breath weapon]]. He could see in [[low-light vision|areas of low-light]] and [[darkvision|areas of total darkness]], out to a distance of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. He was completely unaffected by ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[Paralyze|paralysis]]'', and [[fire magic]] [[spell]]s.

Marjon was a strong athlete, proficient in jumping, climbing, swimming, and [[horse]]back riding. He was well-trained in the use of [[longsword]]s.

==Possessions==
Marjon's prized possession was his ''[[spectral blade]]'', an enchanted longsword. He was often clad in [[full plate]] armor and carried an enchanted ''+2'' [[shield]]. Additionally, he carried two [[Potion of healing|potion of cure serious wounds]].

==Relationships==
Marjon actively disapproved of Pelendralaar's decision of becoming [[undead]].

==History==
In 1369 DR, [[Kya Mordrayn]] and Marjon's father, Pelendralaar, led the Cult of the Dragon to occupy the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]]. The cultists intended on using raw magical power of the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' under the [[Castle Cormanthor]] to infect the cities in the Moonsea with the ''pool's'' corrupting soul-consuming magic. During that period of time, Marjon occupied one of the Castle Cormanthor's subterranean officers' chambers. His room was quite spartan, only holding a metal-flame bed and a metal chair. The rest of the room's furniture was incinerated by its moody occupant, judging by the abundant ash.

In the Cult's hierarchy, Marjon reported directly to its higher-ups, namely [[Ellis]] commanded the half-dragon's daily activities and [[Shamoor]] directed his special tasks and missions.

Soon after the resurrection of the corrupted ''pools'', two independent groups of heroes found themselves opposing the cult. One of the groups managed to infiltrate Castle Cormanthor and destroy Pelendralaar's ''[[phylactery]]'', allowing the other group, the [[Veiled Ones]], to slay Marjon's father and defeat Kya Mordrayn. Marjon was very likely to have survived the events of Myth Drannor.
