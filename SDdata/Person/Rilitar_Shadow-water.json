        "mainbody": "'''Rilitar Shadow-water''' was a male [[moon elf]] [[wizard]] who resided in [[Thentia]] during the late 14th-century DR.",
        "Description": "With dark, shoulder-length hair and an alabaster complextion with a blue tinge, Rilitar was considered to have particularly pleasing features.",
        "Abilites": "Rilitar's prowess in wizardry, along with that of his peers, was such that his mere presence in the city of Thentia gave most slavers, raiders, and pirates pause before attacking. This passive protection Rilitar and the other independent mages granted Thentia, meant that the city could afford to forgo the maintainence of a navy.",
        "Possessions": "Sheathed like a dagger, Rilitar wore a [[topaz]]-tipped [[wand]] on his belt.\n\nRilitar crafted a [[magic]]al [[sword]] with a diamond-shaped cross-section. It was decorated with a sharkskin-wrapped hilt and a [[silver]]-chased green scabbard made of leather. He eventually passed this blade on to [[Taegan Nightwind]].",
        "History": "From at least [[1367 DR]], Rilitar Shadow-water had lived a quiet life among the other wizards of Thentia.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], Rilitar was among a cabal of humanoid wizards in [[Thentia]] who studied the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]'' at [[Firefinger's Tower]]. He continued their studies despite many troubles, the last of which was their draconic ally [[Samdralyrion]] going crazy on [[Mirtul 19]]. After this incident, the [[avariel]] [[Taegan Nightwind]] and [[faerie dragon]] [[Jivex]], suspected that inside their group was a spy sent by [[Sammaster]], and that this agent was responsible for the death of one of the wizards.\n\nTaegan and Jivex discovered that the killer was a [[chasme]] and that Rilitar was its next objective, but managed to save the life of the elven wizard on [[Mirtul 26]].\n\nAfter more investigations and another death among the wizards, it was discovered that the traitor was a [[sunwyrm]] posing as the [[human]] wizard, [[Phourkyn One-Eye]]. In the battle against the sunwyrm on [[Flamerule 11]], Rilitar and his fellows supported Taegan and Jivex, and Phourkyn was destroyed. However, soon after, Rilitar died from the wounds he'd sustained during the fight."
