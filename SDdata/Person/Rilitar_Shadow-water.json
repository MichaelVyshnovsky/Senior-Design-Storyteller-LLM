        "mainbody": "Rilitar Shadow-water was a male moon elf wizard who resided in Thentia during the late 14th-century DR.\nWith dark, shoulder-length hair and an alabaster complextion with a blue tinge, Rilitar was considered to have particularly pleasing features.\nRilitars prowess in wizardry, along with that of his peers, was such that his mere presence in the city of Thentia gave most slavers, raiders, and pirates pause before attacking. This passive protection Rilitar and the other independent mages granted Thentia, meant that the city could afford to forgo the maintainence of a navy.\nSheathed like a dagger, Rilitar wore a topaz-tipped wand on his belt.\nRilitar crafted a magical sword with a diamond-shaped cross-section. It was decorated with a sharkskin-wrapped hilt and a silver-chased green scabbard made of leather. He eventually passed this blade on to Taegan Nightwind. \nFrom at least 1367 DR, Rilitar Shadow-water had lived a quiet life among the other wizards of Thentia.\nIn 1373 DR, Rilitar was among a cabal of humanoid wizards in Thentia who studied the Dracorage mythal at Firefingers Tower. He continued their studies despite many troubles, the last of which was their draconic ally Samdralyrion going crazy on Mirtul 19. After this incident, the avariel Taegan Nightwind and faerie dragon Jivex, suspected that inside their group was a spy sent by Sammaster, and that this agent was responsible for the death of one of the wizards.\nTaegan and Jivex discovered that the killer was a chasme and that Rilitar was its next objective, but managed to save the life of the elven wizard on Mirtul 26.\nAfter more investigations and another death among the wizards, it was discovered that the traitor was a sunwyrm posing as the human wizard, Phourkyn One-Eye. In the battle against the sunwyrm on Flamerule 11, Rilitar and his fellows supported Taegan and Jivex, and Phourkyn was destroyed. However, soon after, Rilitar died from the wounds hed sustained during the fight."
