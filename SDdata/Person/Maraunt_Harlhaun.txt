'''Maraunt Harlhaun''' was the patriarch of the [[Harlhaun]] merchant family in [[Delzimmer]] until at least the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. The Harlhauns were one of four families that ruled Delzimmer just because they were rich and powerful.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|42}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 35: A First Glance at Delzimmer}}

==Description==
The Harlhauns were generally tall, thin, and attractive, and Maraunt was no exception, though he was getting on in years.

==Activities==
{{Main|Harlhaun}}
Maraunt was an avid alchemist that enjoyed creating new scents for the [[perfume]] makers. He also developed drugs with mild or subtle effects, which he often mixed with his scents or adapted the natural odor of the drug into a perfume.

==Relationships==
After the death of his wife, [[Maulauke Harlhaun|Maulauke]], Maraunt started to rely on his daughter and eldest child [[Arleithe Harlhaun|Arleithe]] to be the chatelaine of the manor&mdash;a role she resented.
