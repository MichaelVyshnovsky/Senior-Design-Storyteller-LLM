        "mainbody": "Joon Tsao Choo was an emperor of Shou Lung of ancient times\nJoon Tsao Choo was a great emperor that strongly ruled for many years, expanding the Empire. Many nobles feared the Empires expansion over the Shao Mountains, a land outside their control, and the most rebellious of them formed the Black Maut Cult in order to ruin Joon Tsao and regained their power.\nThe Black Maut Cult sent to the Emperor the concubine Meilan, a woman of great beauty and cleverness, enhanced by a thousandfold by evil enchantments in order to made her irresistible to any men. Soon Joon Tsao fall in love for her, no longer caring for the government of the Empire. Under Meilans suggestion Joon Tsao sent his wife and many of his advisors in prison and also exiled Ahp Hijan, his Minister of State and dearest friend.\nThe Emperor renamed too his capital Kuo Meilan, where he indulged in debauchery and wild revels with Meilan. Meantime the nobles reasserted their power over population.\nAt one point the Celestial Empire sent a huge dragon to warn Joon Tsao to amend his ways in 100 days or he will suffer deathly consequence but the emperor only laughed about this. On the hundredth day an army of dragons descended upon Kuo Meilan and destroyed the city, killing Joon Tsao Choo, Meilan and most of the nobles\nJoon Tsao Choo in truth originated from mistakes made by some sources, such as the biographer Awagi Nukichi, conflated Kujawa with the later Emperor Tan Chin.Ronin Challenge makes several references to Joon Tsao Choo, but the biography by Awagi Nukichi on page 67 is clearly that of the already-established Tan Chin, retelling his fall at Kuo Meilan and appending a disaster striking Tempat Larang (presumably the volcano in the same book) a few years afterward. While Joon Tsao Choo could have been Tan Chin completely, The Grand History of the Realms later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawas death 170 years later, and Tan Chins empire centuries after that, with Tan Chin defeated by Chih Shih as normal. Thus, in-universe, Awagis story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and emperors and its not clear what it might say about Kujawa and Anok-Imaskar, and who killed Kujawa. This article selects references to Joon Tsao Choo and an otherwise-unnamed ancient emperor in Ronin Challenge and assumes they apply to Kujawa where they suit the history of Anok-Imaskar."
