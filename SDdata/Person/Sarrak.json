Lord Harkuldragon demanded Sarrak cancel the intruder's invisibility, which he did; while he did, Cymmarra paralyzed him. She then killed Lord Harkuldragon, who fought her despite her insistence she was there for Sarrak alone.\n\nShortly after, she revealed she's heard Sarrak knew things about Orbakh of Westgate, a [[vampire]] and clone of [[Manshoon]], and so decided to mind-ream the man, despite him begging not to. After her mind-reaming, she blew up his head.",
