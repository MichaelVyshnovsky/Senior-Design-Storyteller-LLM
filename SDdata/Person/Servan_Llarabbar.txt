'''Servan Llarabbar''' was a [[drow]] mage in [[Velkynvelve]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], after the demise of [[Ilvara Mizzrym]], Servan was chosen as the next leader of Velkynvelve, but he and most of his minions had become afflicted by the [[demon lord]]â€“spread madness.

==Personality==
Influenced by madness, Servan started to show heightened paranoia and megalomania. He dreamed of seceding Velkynvelve from Menzoberranzan, to found a land free from the control of the [[matron mother]]s.
