        "Abilities": "While he had once been powerful, Dhimar received no [[spell]]s from his dead god.",
        "Activities": "Dhimar oversaw the [[Temple of Myrkul (Bezantur)|Temple of Myrkul]] in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]], and continued to maintain it long after Myrkul's death during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. He refused to convert to the worship of [[Cyric]] or [[Kelemvor]], and instead clung to the god for whom he had once served as a high priest. As of the late 1360s DR, he was believed to be the last devotee of Myrkul left in [[Faer√ªn]]."
