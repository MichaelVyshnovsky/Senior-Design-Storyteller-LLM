Kerbin Dellmon was the patriarch of the Dellmon family and a farmer during the Elemental Evil crisis.
Kerbin managed a great farm in the valley.
In 1491 DR, the Iceshield orcs attacked many farms around the Dellmon property. However, Kerbin refused to abandon his farm and go to Yartar. So he remained with his workers and family to defend it. With the lucky arrival of some adventurers, he was able to defend the farm.
