        "mainbody": "ord Yoraeida was a commander from Evermeet that led elven forces in the Army of the North during the Return of the Archwizards saga of the late 14 century DR.\nHe was a haughty individual that looked down upon humans and other non-elves, extending even to a chosen of the gods.\nYoraeida led a force of over 500 elven warriors and mages.\nWhen the leaders of the Army of the North rallied their forces against the phaerimm in the Forest of Wyrms in Mirtul of the , they faced an army of thousands of gnolls and bugbears. While Laeral Silverhand did her best to boost spirits about the seemingly insurmountable odds, Yoraeida and others remained pessimistic about their success. Yoraeida even went so far as to say Laeral was distracted by her desire to reunite with her partner Khelben Arunsun, who remained within the borders of beleaguered Evereska. \nEventually, the Army of the North was able to translocate via teleportation circle all the way to the Greycloak Hills, outside the shadowshell in relief of the Evereskan defenders, within a few mere hours. This masterful feat of war time logistics was all for naught however, as the armys Shadovar allies abandoned them soon after their arrival. Enchantments were placed upon Yoraeida and the allied armys leaders so they turned on one another, and their collective detection devices were ultimately ineffective. The phaerimm rapidly descended upon the allied forces and everyone was forced to flee the onslaught."
