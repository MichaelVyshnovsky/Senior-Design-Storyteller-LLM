'''Anderian Dusk''' was a shopkeeper in [[Skullport]] and owner of [[Lanternlighter's]].

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], Anderian had a very good understanding that a thing that people sure needed in Skullport were lights. So he sold lights of all kinds in his shop.

He was still in operation during the early 1490s [[DR]] but he was a broken man that spied his customers under orders of the [[sea hag]]s of [[Sargauth|Sargauth River]].
