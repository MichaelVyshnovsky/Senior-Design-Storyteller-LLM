        "mainbody": "Thusk Tharmuil was a powerful archmage who lived in Glister in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was often credited with keeping the town safe despite its hostile location in Thar.\nThusk was not merely Glisters most powerful wizard, but one of Glisters claims to fame in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The man himself was  tall, appearing as a portly man in his 50s with a balding head and a bushy grey unibrow. He preferred to dress simply, such as in a gray robe with black slippers. He did, however, wear a silver-rimmed belt which held a jeweled dagger.\nThusk was talkative and jovial, and was generally a kind and sympathetic individual. He was gracious to those who shared his zany sense of humor and could make him laugh. He enjoyed eating, drinking, joking, singing, and telling stories, and had a deep, baritone singing voice.\nHis tower was built into a hill on the east side of Glister.\nThusk was ostensibly retired, although he still took an active interest in the peace and safety of Glister, and kept an eye on the orcs and ogres of Thar as well as the activities of evil factions like the Zhentarim and the Cult of the Dragon. He would go so far as to recruit and pay adventurers passing through town to solve the regions problems. When sizing up an adventuring partys worthiness, he would invite them to a sumptuous dinner of rich food and wine to swap tales and tell jokes. If he liked the adventurers, we would treat them to a dessert of pudding and coffee.\nThusk was a protector of Glister and an important source of its regional power, responsibilities he shared alongside the towns temples the Hall of Luck, the House of Swords, and the House of Aurils Breath.\nAs of the late 1360s DR, Thusk had a dutiful apprentice named Menzel and a beleaguered cat named Sasha.\nThusk kept in touch with other wizards in order to stay abreast of news.\nHe took a hard stance against the Zhentarim and any plans or projects they had within Thar.\nIn his adventuring days, Thusk led a party known as The Company of the Cat. He retired to Glister at some point prior to the Vaasan War and was nominally credited for being the reason that Zhengyi the Witch-King of Vaasa did not attempt to march his forces across the Galena Mountains into Thar.\nIn the , Thusk aided a young refugee from Vaasa to find a band of adventurers to help her rescue her parents from dragon-riding brigands, whom Thusk correctly surmised to be members of the Cult of the Dragon. Unbeknownst to the archmage, however, the teenage girl was in fact a steel dragon named Steelheart."
