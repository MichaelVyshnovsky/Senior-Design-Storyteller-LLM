        "mainbody": "Uliskh Belarra was a notable wizard inhabiting Yeshpek along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nUliskh was young but unhealthy. He was bald and rather ugly.\nHe was utterly devoted to the security and defense of the city.\nHe used magic to alter his appearance when an amorous mood struck him and he wished to enjoy the company of Yeshpeks women."
