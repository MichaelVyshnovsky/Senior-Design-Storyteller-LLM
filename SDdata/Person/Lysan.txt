'''Lysan''' was a manipulative [[cleric]] of [[Auril]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1281 DR]].

==Physical description==
Lysan was a blond woman who typically wore blue clothing with ice-colored edges.

==Abilities==
Lysan was a cleric of seemingly low power. She somehow cursed the entire [[Vale of Shadows]] and raised the dead as [[shadow]]s to scare the people of [[Kuldahar]]. She believed that it was the power of the goddess Auril herself that was within her. According to Kontik, a follower of Auril sent to assassinate the party responsible for Lysan's death, Lysan was a [[Chosen]] of Auril.

==Possessions==
Lysan was known to possess an enchanted [[cloak]] named the ''[[Mantle of the Coming Storm]]''. She also possessed [[scroll]]s of ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[cure critical wounds]]'', and ''[[protection from fire]]''.

==History==
Her primary mission was to open the tomb of the barbarian king [[Kresselack]] to the cold winds and cleanse out the light and sources of warmth within that tomb. To do so, she infiltrated the society of Kuldahar, acting as a waitress at the local tavern [[Root Cellar]]. She spread stories convincing the people of Kuldahar, including the wise Archdruid [[Arundel]], that there was a threat within the Vale of Shadows were Kresselack was entombed.

Adventurers were recruited by Arundel to investigate the Vale of Shadows. They eventually slew all the [[undead]] guardians of Kresselack's tomb, making it possible for Lysan to carry out her mission. The risen Kresselack recruited the party to slay Lysan; afterwards, he told the party that there was no one threatening Kuldahar in the Vale.
