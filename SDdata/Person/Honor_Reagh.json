        "mainbody": "\"Honor\" Reagh was a female member of the Nasher in Neverwinter.\nIn 1484 DR, taking advantage of the chaos resulting from the undead assault on Neverwinter, led by Valindra Shadowmantle, Reagh and her friend Gothwan Cooper, under the orders from the Nasher leader Karzov, sneaked inside the Hall of Justice and stole the Crown of Neverwinter. An adventurer recruited by Sergeant Knox tried to recover it but was prevented by having to fight the Guardian of the Nine. Later, the adventurer, thanks to Knoxs advice, found Reagh in a ruined tunnel near Driftwood Tavern and defeated her."
