        "History": "In [[1484 DR]], taking advantage of the chaos resulting from the [[undead]] assault on Neverwinter, led by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], Reagh and her friend [[Gothwan Cooper]], under the orders from the Nasher leader [[Karzov]], sneaked inside the [[Hall of Justice]] and stole the [[Crown of Neverwinter]]. An adventurer recruited by Sergeant [[Knox]] tried to recover it but was prevented by having to fight the [[Guardian of the Nine]]. Later, the adventurer, thanks to Knox's advice, found Reagh in a ruined tunnel near [[Driftwood Tavern]] and defeated her."
