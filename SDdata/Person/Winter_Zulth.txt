Winter Zulth was a half-elf living in Waterdeep and the regional agent of the Moonstars for non-Faer√ªnian locations in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.
Winter was raised in Waterdeep and worked at the Horizons Sails as a map-maker. He used his position for the Moonstars cause by collating  maps and logbooks from exotic places like Zakhara, Maztica, and Kara-Tur and producing unique maps that were extremely valuable to explorers and navigators. He could also provide a ship for the Moonstars needs upon request.
