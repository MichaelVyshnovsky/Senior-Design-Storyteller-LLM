Kara Calaudra was the heir of Calaudra House in Melvaunt in 1374 DR.
Kara, like all the Calaudra, was training as a wizard.
In 1374 DR, she sponsored an adventuring party and had gained some money from her familys treasure. Secretly, she met with her friends Argens Bruil, Kalman Leiyraghon, Elaint Marsk, and Oreal Nanther planning to go on an adventure, with the support of the dwarf mercenary Dorn Crownshield.
They found a "treasure map" (in truth, a trap devised by Bremen Leiyraghon) and went to adventure in Thar, only to be captured by the orog Daazlag and his orc minions.
Kara was imprisoned in a cave in XÃ»l-Jarak with all her friends. Kara was waiting for the right time to escape but had no ready spells.
Kara was infatuated with Elaint Marsk, a thing that pleased her father Andros Calaudra. She had a raven familiar called Esselion.
