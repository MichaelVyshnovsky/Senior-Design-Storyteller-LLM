'''Aglanthol the Red''' was the second [[High Mage (Silverymoon)|High Mage]] of [[Silverymoon]], having taking over as leader of the city from his uncle, [[Ecamane Truesilver]] in [[712 DR]].<ref name=tGHotR-p82>

==History==
It was under Aglanthol's reign, in [[714 DR]], that the great [[elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]] fell to [[demon]]s. Many noble heroes from Silverymoon hurried to the elves' aid and managed to help rescue some of their more prominent nobles and scholars. Some Silvaeren gave their lives in this endeavour.

Despite these heroics, the following years would see other citizens of Silverymoon attempt to plunder the ruins of Myth Drannor via a [[portal]].<ref name=tGHotR-p99> In doing so, they brought in [[fiend]]ish creatures from the [[Outer Planes]] to the ''Gem of the North'' and a battle ensued. Aglanthol died in combat, in the [[Year of the Lost Lord]], defending his city from these [[devil]]s and demons.
