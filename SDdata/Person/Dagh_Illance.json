        "Personality": "He was hot tempered and battle-hungry,",
        "History": "In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold [[orc]] band that had raided a caravan east of [[Eveningstar]]; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a [[hydra]], a \"[[fire lizard]]\", and three [[chimera]]s. They were on a high meadow north of [[Startop Crag]] when they sighted the orcs; Dagh was the first to hurl a spear and the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush. Their [[dark naga]] master hurled a lightning bolt and Dagh and a few others were killed, before Alusair rallied her forces to defeat their foes. She muttered \"good riddance to Illance\".",
