'''Aumark Lithyl''' was the ruler of [[Ruathym]].

==History==
Before becoming the ruler of Ruathym, Aumark Lithyl was a member of the adventuring band known as the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]. 

During a war with [[Luskan]] in [[Uktar]], [[1357 DR]], Aumark united the island of Ruathym and brought the four conflicting nations together into a single united kingdom unified nation. 

Around [[1358 DR]], Aumark had 500 [[warrior]]s under his command and three warships, which were loaned to him by First Axe [[Wedigar Ruthmaald]] of [[Holgerstead]], a smaller Ruathym kingdom.
