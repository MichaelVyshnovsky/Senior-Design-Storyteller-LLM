Umbero was an adventurer with the Brightstar Sash in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
He adventured with the Brightstar Sash company.
Umbero was a part of the Brightstar Sash at the same time as the sorceress Caladnei. At least one of their forays yielded them about six thousand gold pieces, for which he thanked Tymora.
He later perished as they escaped a wyvern.
