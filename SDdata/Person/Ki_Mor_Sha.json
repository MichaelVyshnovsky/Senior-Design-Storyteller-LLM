        "mainbody": "'''Ki Mor Sha''' was the mayor of the town of [[Tai He]] on [[Akari]] in the [[Prioto Islands]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "Ki Mor Sha was the brother-in-law of [[Ko Lei Kho]], the governor of Akari.",
        "History": "Although Mayor Ki ordered the townsfolk to avoid the [[Ochimo]] spirit warriors that terrorized the island around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, he had them maintain big bonfires and keep watch around the plateau by night. While the townsfolk feared the Ochimo and complained about Governor Ko's handling of the matter, they felt Mayor Ki was doing the best he could. Ki put the priests at the local temple to the [[Path of Enlightenment]] to work on the spirit problem, but host a celebration for any [[adventurer]]s who happened to defeat one. However, this would draw the ire of the remaining spirits to his home."
