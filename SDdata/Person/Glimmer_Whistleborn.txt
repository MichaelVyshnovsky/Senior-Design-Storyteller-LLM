==Description==
Glimmer was a fair-skinned female [[rock gnome]] with red pixie-cut hair and big brown eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Glimmer Whistleborn worked on her regularly printed column for the ''Baldur's Mouth Gazette''. During the [[Absolute crisis]], the gnome could be found working within Baldur's Mouth's offices in [[Heapside]] of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. She expressed her discomfort with the offices being guarded by the [[steel watcher]]s, being unable to concentrate under their disconcerting gaze. One of her column's topics of note was ''The Absolutist Next Door,'' in which Glimmer recounted eight warning signs one's neighbor was a cultist of the [[Absolute]]. However, as the gazette was tasked with printing propaganda for the new Lord [[Enver Gortash]], Glimmer's work likely bore no truth. Despite that, she received a letter from "A Loyal Reader," who thanked the gnome for her column and claimed that their uphill neighbor displayed all eight warning signs. The reader promised to watch the "traitor" neighbor and report him to the [[Flaming Fist]] upon the first witnessed (or perceived) crime.
