Stirge was a gnome known for being a murderer of infants, and was imprisoned in the jail of Waterdeep in 1372 DR.
After being imprisoned for killing babies, Stirge managed to escape the prison along with his accomplices, being the first to ever escape the high-security jail. From this point onwards, he was one of the most wanted criminals across the Sword Coast. He had a large bounty on his head, which could be collected by turning in his tattooed ear.
