'''Stirge''' was a [[gnome]] known for being a murderer of infants, and was imprisoned in the jail of [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
After being imprisoned for killing babies, Stirge managed to escape the prison along with his accomplices, being the first to ever escape the high-security jail. From this point onwards, he was one of the most wanted criminals across the [[Sword Coast]]. He had a large bounty on his head, which could be collected by turning in his tattooed ear.
