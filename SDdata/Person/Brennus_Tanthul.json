        "mainbody": "Prince '''Brennus Tanthul''' was the youngest of the twelve [[Princes of Shade]] sired by High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]], and one that played an important role in the early years of the [[Second Sundering]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], and eventually the second collapse of [[Sakkors]].\n{{quote|''Your bitterness is sweet...to me''|Brennus Tanthul}}",
        "Description": "Brennus had eyes the color of [[iron]], highlighted with just a bit of orange. He laso had a rather large, crescent-shaped mouth.",
        "Personality": "When addressing others, Brennus conducted himself in a formal and cordial manner.",
        "Abilities": "Brennus displayed great skill with [[arcane magic]] and was a prodigious scholar of history, particularly that of ancient [[Netheril]]. He served as Thultanthar's resident lore-keeper on the culture and history of the [[Shadovar]] people along with the historical origins of the City of Shade itself.",
        "Possessions": "The prince's personal sigil included a trio of mountaintops above which sat a sphere of silver, all set on a field of ochre brown.",
        "Activities": "In service of his father and his people, Brennus helped locate the remnants of ancient [[Netheril]] and ordered expeditions to recover long-lost knowledge and artifacts of his people's \"ancestors\". He believed that old arcane power concealed in these ruins held the key to the success of Netheril's return on [[Faerûn]].",
        "Relationships": "It was observed by some that Brennus was among the favored of Telamont Tanthul's children. High Prince Tanthul arranged for his youngest son to receive the finest education possible, with a focus on the history of their people. Brennus held his father partly at fault for the death of his own mother [[Alashar Tanthul|Alashar]], believing Telamont should have taken a stance against the elder prince [[Rivalen Tanthul|Rivalen]] as he slew Alashar in the name of the goddess [[Shar]].\n\nBy the end of the [[Era of Upheaval]], Brennus was accompanied nearly at all times by his two [[homunculi]] constructs.",
        "History": "When the Princes of Shade returned to [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Brennus and his elder brothers [[Lamorak Tanthul|Lamorak]] and [[Yder Tanthul|Yder]] appeared before the [[Bedine]] tribespeople camped near the [[Shoal of Thirst]]. They tried to warn the [[human]]s about the upcoming changes that would take hold over the desert landscape but were perceived as [[devil]]s or [[djinn]] by the superstitious Bedine, taking on the local witch [[Ruha]] as a guide. Afterwards, Brennus accompanied [[Clariburnus Tanthul|Clariburnus]] to the lair of the great [[Blue dragon|blue]] [[dracolich]] [[Malygris]], freed it from bondage to the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and made a new ally for the emerging conflict between Thultanthar and the people of the [[Heartlands]].\n\nBrennus died in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, when Sakkors crashed on the city of [[Ordulin]]. Brennus held his brother [[Rivalen]] down during the disaster, finally taking revenge for the death of their mother Alashar. After Brennus' death, his pair of homunculi were taken in by Telamont in a final act of tenderness to his favored younger son."
