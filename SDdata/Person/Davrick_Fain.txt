'''Davrick Fain''' was the lead cultist of [[Auril]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1484 DR]].

==History==
Davrick was a common merchant of [[Bremen]] until the winter of [[1483 DR]] when the power of Auril truly manifested to him. Soon he started gathering in his city a small cult of Auril, also founding a small temple in a old [[verbeeg]] cave in [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Davrick befriended [[Rycher]] at that time and thanks to him Davrick found an egg of a [[remorhaz]], which he saw as Auril's sacred creature. He hoped to hatch it and send the monster against unbelievers.
