'''Lumalia''' was an [[astral deva]] prisoner in the [[Doomvault]] dungeon for centuries.

==Personality==
Lumalia's long imprisonment deeply affected her, among other things changing her from [[neutral good]] to [[chaotic good]]. She regretted all the time she'd spent in stasis. Lumalia wanted to bring justice to the [[Thayan]]s for their crimes but in the fury of battle she could succumb to a thirst for revenge.

==History==
Centuries before the 15th century [[DR]], the [[Red Wizard]] [[Kazit Gul]] summoned Lumalia and bound her to the Doomvault. He put her in stasis and compelled her to slay each time she awoke. She sensed the death of [[Mystra]] during [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]] and succumbed to despair.

Awoken in [[1486 DR]] by the arrival of heroes from [[Daggerford]], Lumalia sensed something different, she felt the celestial spheres shifting. With this, Gul's power over her was broken. She offered her aid to the heroes.
