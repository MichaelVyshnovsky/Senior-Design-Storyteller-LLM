Anya was the chief scout and lieutenant for Vaugs Claw, a fighting force within the Tornskulls tribe of Dead Orc Pass. Unlike other female orcs, her combat prowess earned her the right to fight alongside the males.
Seldom found at the orcs living areas, Anya took efforts to continuously scout the areas throughout the canyon.
Anya was supportive of her superior, Vaug the Strong. She herself was favored by one of the tribes overseers, War-leader Baerzel.
