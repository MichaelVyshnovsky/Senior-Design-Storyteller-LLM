'''Vidruand Starbrow''' was a heroic son of the famed hero [[Roadwarden]] of the [[Roadwarden Guard]], [[Arelin Starbrow]], active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
When Vidruand wore the ornate horned ''Helm of the Roadwarden'', from distance, he resembled a [[minotaur]].

==Relationships==
[[Dazmilar]], [[Kallithrea]], and [[Yemandra]], all considered Vidruand to be tier better, a hero just as great as his mother. Locals of [[Skull Crag]] venerated Vidruand and thought only him to be a worthy successor as the Roadwarden.

==Possessions==
Vidruand wielded a set of [[enchanted]] ''+3'' weapons and armor: a [[longsword]], a [[chainmail]], a [[shield]], and a [[helmet]]'' He also wore a ''[[ring of fire resistance]].''

==History==
By the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], aged 33, Vidruand and his mother [[Arelin Starbrow]] were members of the Roadwarden Guar and were considered great heroes, beloved by the locals. However, Vidruand went missing, believed dead. Sometime after, Arelin perished in a devious monster attack. With Arelin Starbrow's death, the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' were lost and scattered by the monster horde. In reality, Vidruand was captured and turned into a [[vampire]] by the [[Skull Crag Keep]]'s ancient enemies and its previous master, ancient vampires [[Khulzond]] and his consort [[Mordroka]]. Vidruand was the person commanding the monsters who slew his mother, and he claimed one of the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' – the ''Helm of the Roadwarden''. As the plot against Skull Crag unfolded, a group of adventurers joined the Roadwarden Guards, helping Vidruand's siblings in the ''Arms''' recovery.

When all ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' were collected, apart from Vidruand's ''Helm'', the long feared dead man reappeared. Wearing the ''Helm of the Roadwarden'' in the Skull Crag Keep's Great Hall, he reunited with the family. Vidruand's face was concealed by the [[helmet]] as he demanded the rest of the ''Arms'' to slay the adventurers, whom he claimed were responsible for Arelin Starbrow's death and kept him imprisoned. Without thinking, [[Yemandra Starbrow]] charged at the group, [[sword]] drawn. But she found herself on the ground after [[Dazmilar]] tripped her. The rest of the gathered siblings and [[Sir Dutiocs]] saw through Vidruand's lies.

With the bluff's failure, Vidruand removed the ''Helm of the Roadwarden,'' revealing his [[undead]] nature. He was a vampire. The prodigal son unleashed an army of [[giant rat]]s and [[mobat]]s at the gathered family but was defeated after a fierce battle. It was not quite over yet. Two sinister voices turned the heads of all in the Great Hall. Two ancient vampires glided into the castle – Khulzond and his consort Mordroka, the original masters of Skull Crag Keep. The vampires were the true leaders of the monsters and the cause of the Keep's strife. The undead proclaimed their intentions to take back what was theirs – the Keep and the ''Arms of the Roadwarden''. With a single command word, Mordroka reformed Vidruand Starbrow's undead body and commanded the ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' to fly towards the undead Starbrow. Khulzond, Mordroka, Vidruand, and summoned monsters and vampires attacked the heroes, Sir Dutiocs, Dazmilar, Kallithrea, and Yemandra. However, the magic that kept the heroes paralyzed was broken by [[Lunit Bdufe]] who used the last of her strength to free the defenders and recall the ''Arms'' away from the vampire. A long battle raged, but the defenders of the Keep emerged victorious.
