        "mainbody": "Kaerasz was a dairy farmer and a former Elder of the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was known for his ill temper and arrogance.\nKaerasz had once been elected Elder of the villages governing Council, but he made decisions arbitrarily and turned out to be too arrogant for the other councilors liking, so they voted him. As of 1357 DR, Kaerasz still lived in the village and had few friends."
