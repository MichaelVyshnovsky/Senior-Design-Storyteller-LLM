Eshek was an acolyte of Savras active in Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
He sought to be as helpful as possible.
Eshek would speak with jungle porters, such as those who traveled to and from Camp Vengeance. From these relationships, he learned about the location of places in the Chultan jungle like Mbala.
During the events of the death curse, he was overcome with a powerful urge to find a specific group of adventurers and deliver a message directing them to Orolunga. He could not remember anything else about how or why he was overcome with this mission.
