==Personality==
He sought to be as helpful as possible.

==Relationships==
Eshek would speak with jungle [[porter]]s, such as those who traveled to and from [[Camp Vengeance]]. From these relationships, he learned about the location of places in the Chultan jungle like [[Mbala]].

==History==
During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} he was overcome with a powerful urge to find a specific group of [[adventurer]]s and deliver a message directing them to Orolunga. He could not remember anything else about how or why he was overcome with this mission.
