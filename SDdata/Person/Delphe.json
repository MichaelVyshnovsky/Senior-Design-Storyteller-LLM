        "mainbody": "elphe was a star elf abjurer and a Keeper of the Cerulean Sign.\nDelphe was reassured by her little superstitions, often murmuring \"Alls well in the Well\" when nothing had happened.\nDelphe was in charge of the Inner Bastion of Stardeep. and of monitoring The Well in particular.\nDelphe once possessed a Cerulean Sign, an amulet with potent magical powers against elder aberrations though it was destroyed in 1375 DR by Telarian using the sword Angul-Nis.\nShe considered Cynosure too unimaginative, and Telarian too humorless, though the former could make her laugh sometimes. There was some friction between her and Telarian from when a few years before, shed been chosen to wield the Sign instead of him.\nEventually, she came to school Raidon Kane on the use of his bonded Cerulean Sign.\nDelphe specialized in abjuration. Amongst the spells she could call upon quickly were wall of force, lightning bolt, and a version of black blade of disaster which she knew as a spellscythe.\nDelphes time as a Keeper started about a decade before . In Midwinter of that year, she thwarted one new escape attempt by the Traitor. Though Cynosure was of some help eventually on that day, she began to suspect the construct was not functioning properly.\nDelphe confronted Telarian some days later after finding a letter from Captain Brathtar, learning about the Epoch Chamber and the raid on a nearby wood elf encampment on the same day that the raid was taking place. Considering the simultaneity implied the attackers were in league with the Traitor, she ordered the Causeway sealed, and disconnected all instances of Cynosure from the command functions in Stardeep.\nShe agreed later to reinject Cynosure into the loop, instance by instance. However, Telarian left her to this task alone. Due to fatigue, she decided to bring Cynosure back to functions with a small number of nodes, so that it could help her root out the infected nodes. Cynosure was able to inform her that the one subverting him was Telarian, and reveal the true extent of his subversions. She immediately sought him out, finding that he had ridden out of Stardeep through the Underdungeon When he returned with Kiril Duskmourn, she tried to talk to her, and convince her that Telarian was the actual traitor. Before she could, Raidon Kane triggered a teleportation into The Well manually.\nTelarians sword severed half her hand and sundered the Sign she carried. After the battle, Delphe asked Raidon Kane to use his bonded Cerulean Sign to reinforce the wards around the Well. He accepted.\nPer the construct Cynosure, as of , she had re-entered SildÃ«yuir fifteen years prior (placing the date in ) and never returned to Stardeep.\nTelarian accused her of being the one that had been subverted by the Traitor when he was talking to Kiril Duskmourn."
