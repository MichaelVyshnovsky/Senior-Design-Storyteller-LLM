        "mainbody": "Khonsu was a senator of Innarlith in the midâ€“14 century DR. He was assassinated by Willem Korvan when Korvan attempted to advance to his own senate seat.\nHe typically dressed in a conservative fashion.\nHe was a great patron of the temple of Waukeen, to which he had donated a great deal of money over the years. When Korvan made his first attempt to assassinate him by poison, a team of clerics from the temple came to rescue him and were able to keep him alive for months.  \nKhonsu was a long-serving member of the senate of Innarlith and a wealthy aristocrat. By the time of his assassination he was the oldest senator in Innarlith. \nHe ran committees on the senate and had important allies in the body. He formerly had been the senator in charge of selecting new senators.\nWillem Korvan, the deputy of master-builder Senator Inthelph, attempted to assassinate him by poison in the year 1363 DR. However, Khonsu survived the attempt with help from priests of Waukeen. Khonsu didnt reveal Korvans assassination attempt, however, and in the following year, Korvan made a second attempt in which he disemboweled Khonsu with a knife inside of his home. Korvans reason for killing Khonsu was to protect Inthelphs position, since he feared that Khonsu was about to turn on Inthelph, owing to Inthelphs incompetence with the building projects he had been entrusted with. Inthelph was Korvans principal patron and gateway to advancing to the senate.\nA lavish funeral was paid for by Khonsus estate. It included a procession down the streets through Ransars ride in the second quarter of Innarlith."
