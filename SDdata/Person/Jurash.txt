Jurash was a priest of Ishistu and cultist of the Shorn who inhabited Moradask in the Burning Lands in 1367 DR.
Jurash captured a desert centaur named Tebessa al-Khawati as she was bathing in an oasis near the Sea of Salt. He attempted to shave all of the hair from Tebessas body to serve as a sacrifice, but succeeded only in removing her proud warriors braid before she was rescued.
