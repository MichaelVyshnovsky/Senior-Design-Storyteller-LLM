'''Hu Chien''' was a [[Shou]] [[wu jen]] in [[Okahira]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In 1357 DR, Hu Chien arrived in Okahira and so impressed the [[shugo-matadai]] [[Kadokawa Shigetada]] that he became his principal counselor. Under his suggestions, Kadokawa introduced many reforms. Secretly, however, he was under the orders of the [[Great Emperor Chin]] of [[Shou Lung]]. Hu Chien plotted to take control of the city for himself and afterward seize the nearby [[Hiro castle]]. He had gathered a garrison of 800 Shou [[bushi]] disguised as sailors, plus his own bodyguard force of 200 bushi and 10 barbarians.

==Personality==
Only Hu Chien knew he was following his emperor's orders.
