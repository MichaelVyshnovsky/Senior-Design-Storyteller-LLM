        "Personality": "As a mortal, T'Laan was a lover of peace and earned the trust of everyone he knew. After his turn to undeath, his primary motivation was to soothe his endless thirst for blood.",
        "History": "T'Laan was originally from Toril, from the country of [[Aglarond]]. Born in the late 10{{th}} or early 11{{th}} century [[DR]], his name was originally '''Dorin''', and he was the son of a [[human]] father and an [[elven]] mother. He was one of Aglarond's original settlers, and he became a trusted advisor and general for [[Brindor Olóssyne]].\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Ingdal's Arm]], Dorin was responsible for the Peace Talks of Ingdal's Arm, which unified the people into the nation of Aglarond, and Brindor became its first king.\n\nThe birth of a new nation so close by disturbed the magocracy of [[Thay]]. That country sent a group of bandits to assassinate Dorin, and they succeeded at slaying his new wife, who was with him. Dorin slew many of the attackers, but they eventually succeeded at striking a mortal blow. As he lay dying, so filled he was with hate that he begged for revenge and made an agreement with Death. He was ordered to drink the blood of one of the fallen attackers to seal the bargain\n\nAfter having struck the deal with Death, Dorin became a vampire and left his homeworld behind. Now known as T'Laan, he took up residence in a [[crystal sphere]] now known as [[Darkspace]], where he fed on its other inhabitants until they were nearly wiped out and using his powerful magics to reduce the sphere's sun to little more than a dead husk.\n\nRealizing his source of blood was running out, T'Laan began searching other spheres for [[human]]s to bring back to his own. One of these spheres was Realmspace, and another was [[w:c:spelljammer:Greatspace|Greatspace]].\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n| text   = Alas, poor Alanna, I was far too evil for your mortal beauty.\n| source = T'Laan, in a note to one of his victims\n}}\nOne such victim from Toril was an elven maiden named Alanna, whom T'Laan decided to take as a wife instead of as a mere source of nourishment.
