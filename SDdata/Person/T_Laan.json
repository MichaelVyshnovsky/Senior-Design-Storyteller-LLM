        "mainbody": "TLaan was a vampire from Toril who traveled Realmspace and other spheres, searching for blood.\nTLaan had pale, alabaster skin, and was dressed in black, gold, and purple clothing. His shoulder-length hair was entirely black save for a streak of white near his left temple.\nAs a mortal, TLaan was a lover of peace and earned the trust of everyone he knew. After his turn to undeath, his primary motivation was to soothe his endless thirst for blood.\nTLaan was originally from Toril, from the country of Aglarond. Born in the late 10 or early 11 century DR, his name was originally Dorin, and he was the son of a human father and an elven mother. He was one of Aglaronds original settlers, and he became a trusted advisor and general for Brindor Olóssyne.\nAfter the Battle of Ingdals Arm, Dorin was responsible for the Peace Talks of Ingdals Arm, which unified the people into the nation of Aglarond, and Brindor became its first king.\nThe birth of a new nation so close by disturbed the magocracy of Thay. That country sent a group of bandits to assassinate Dorin, and they succeeded at slaying his new wife, who was with him. Dorin slew many of the attackers, but they eventually succeeded at striking a mortal blow. As he lay dying, so filled he was with hate that he begged for revenge and made an agreement with Death. He was ordered to drink the blood of one of the fallen attackers to seal the bargain\nAfter having struck the deal with Death, Dorin became a vampire and left his homeworld behind. Now known as TLaan, he took up residence in a crystal sphere now known as Darkspace, where he fed on its other inhabitants until they were nearly wiped out and using his powerful magics to reduce the spheres sun to little more than a dead husk.\nRealizing his source of blood was running out, TLaan began searching other spheres for humans to bring back to his own. One of these spheres was Realmspace, and another was Greatspace.\nOne such victim from Toril was an elven maiden named Alanna, whom TLaan decided to take as a wife instead of as a mere source of nourishment. However, when he finally sought to consummate his \"marriage\" with her, he found himself unable to perform in his undead body. Enraged, he murdered her in the bed and left her skeleton there in the room for years.\nEventually, a prince from Greatspace sought help from a group of adventurers, who ultimately were able to defeat the evil vampire. However, before he was truly destroyed, TLaans hatred was so great that he was pulled into the demiplane of Ravenloft."
