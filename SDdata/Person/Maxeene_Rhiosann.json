        "mainbody": "Maxeene Rhiosann, called \"the Flute\", was a famed singer in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14th century DR and the Lady Voice of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers, the musicians guild of the city.\nStill considered young by 1368 DR, Maxeene was a portly woman oft draped in voluminous robes. She kept her hair in amazing, upswept sculptures. But, in particular, her voice was claimed by her admirers to give praise with every note to Milil, god of song.\nMaxeene was known to be kind and diligent in her work. She hoped that the long-lived and long-reigning guildmaster Kriios Halambar would continue in his position.\nMaxeene was a skilled singer.\nMaxeene was famous throughout Waterdeep for giving performances to small gatherings of the most cultured and refined nobility. These performances lasted for hours.\nA member of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers, Maxeene ascended to the position of Voice of the Council by 1357 DR. In this role, she served as its primary contact with outsiders and as understudy for the guildmaster, or Master Musician, Kriios Halambar.\nShe continued in this role through 1368 DR.\nWhen Kriios Halambar finally died in the early 1370s DR, the position of interim Master Musician passed to the Voice of the Council, Maxeene Rhiosann, as was custom. Since she openly asserted she had no wish to hold the position, by the end of 1372 DR, leading guild musicians had begun to jostle for influence and position ahead of the next election in the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR. This provoked thinly veiled tensions between leading Waterdhavian musicians, both in the Council and in New Olamns leadership."
