        "Activities": "Alongside [[Ulla]], Pog was one of Gnomengarde's sentries. It was his job to hail any outsiders in [[Common]], and to attack anyone he deemed to be a threat.",
        "Abilities": "In addition to his innate [[gnome|gnomish]] abilities, Pog (like everyone else in Gnomengarde) had some training as a [[wizard]]. In combat, he preferred to attack with [[spells]] like ''[[ray of frost]]'' and ''[[magic missile]]''.",
        "History": "When Gnomengarde came under attack by a [[mimic]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the only information given to the gnomes by their king, [[Korboz]], was to attack any [[shapechanger]]s on sight. Unfortunately, this left Pog and his partner Ulla in a predicament because ''anyone'' could be a shapechanger. They were thus highly suspicious of any outsiders, and were unlikely to let anyone pass without a fight unless they could persuade the sentries otherwise or unless they had an audience with King Korboz or King [[Gnerkli]]."
