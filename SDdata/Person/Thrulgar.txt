'''Thrulgar''' was a soldier in [[Eveningstar]], [[Cormyr]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
He was firm and ready to die for King [[Azoun IV]] and Lady [[Tessaril Winter]].

==Possessions==
He wielded a [[spear]].

==Activities==
He served as a doorguard at [[Tessaril's Tower]], alongside [[Azatlim]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, Thrulgar was standing guard together with Azatlim when they were approached by [[Mirt]], [[Shandril Shessair]], and [[Narm Tamaraith]], who were determined to get in. Before the situation turned violent because of Thrulgar's insistence no one could pass without audience in the night, he recommended them to go to the [[Lonesome Tankard]] instead. [[Tzin Tzummer]] helped delay them, as did Mirt, who produced a ''[[Harper pin]]'' and a ring gifted by Azoun IV, but it wasn't until Tessaril ushered the three in that they were allowed to enter.

Later, when [[Iliph Traun]] attacked the keep, Thrulgar led in a number of armed civilians, all of them ready to hold off the [[lich lord]] and die in the process, which they did. Thrulgar was amongst the casualties.
