Lord '''Orlpar Husteem''' was a [[human]] living on [[Golden Serpent Street]] in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] and a member of the [[House Husteem|Husteem]] noble house.

==Personality==
Orlpar was a trader of drugs, perfumes, [[spices]] and [[wine]]s, although some of his wares were illicit, such as [[bloodroot]]. He frequented the [[Grinning Lion]] tavern in the North Ward, where he sourced his supply of goods from its proprietor, [[Unger Farshal]].

==Relationships==
Orlpar's elder brother was [[Orbos Husteem]], patriarch of the Husteem house.

==Possessions==
Orlpar used either a [[dagger]] or a [[rapier]] in combat, both of which were of masterwork quality. He wore a [[mithral]] [[chain shirt]] and owned a pair of ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]''.

He lived in a townhouse in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] on the south side of [[Gold Serpent Street]], between [[Nindabar Street]] and [[Zendulth Street]].

==History==
Orlpar operated his day-to-day business from his home address. He employed [[Hala Myrt]] to be on the streets of the city in order to acquire customers who were sent to meet Orlpar at the Grinning Lion. Orlpar began his criminal career as a fence of stolen goods (spices, scents, wines and drugs), but later moved into dealing in drugs such as [[haunspeir]], [[mordayn powder]] and [[tekkil]]. He collaborated with the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]].
