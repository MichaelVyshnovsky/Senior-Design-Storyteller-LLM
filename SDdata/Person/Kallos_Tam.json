        "mainbody": "'''Kallos Tam''' was a [[necromancer]] and a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], and the true menace behind the [[Blackdagger Bandits]] that raided the [[High Road]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].",
        "History": "Kallos Tam was one of a number of Thayan agents dispatched to the area around [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1470s [[DR]], with the aim to cause trouble. He saw an opportunity in the Blackdaggers. Meeting their leaders, the brothers [[Traven Blackdagger|Traven]] and [[Malus Blackdagger]], Kallos proposed to excavate and take control of the [[undead]] army within the [[Cragmire Crypts]], giving them the army they desired to take over Neverwinter. Secretly, Kallos intended to retain control of the undead for himself, and thus the real power in the alliance. The brothers were receptive to his offer, only doubting if Kallos could do it or not.\n\nKallos proved he could. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, he broke the magical seal of Cragmire Crypt and discovered inside some artifacts he was seeking, found the undead army still waiting there, and, he said, the means of controlling them. However, Traven did not fully trust Kallos and went with him and some of the Blackdaggers' best fighters into the crypts. The [[Harper]] agents [[Garl Gnarlclaw]] and [[Xalliana]] discovered the plot and recruited an [[adventurer]] to destroy the bandits. Xalliana went to hunt Kallos and Traven herself, but didn't return. A [[unnamed ghost (Cragmire Crypts)|priest of Kelemvor]] also came to stop Kallos, and was slain in cold blood. In the end, Garl sent the adventurer and a party descended into the Cragmire Crypts, fought through both bandits and undead, and killed Kallos and Traven."
