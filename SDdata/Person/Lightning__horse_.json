        "History": "In [[1357 DR]], companions of the hero [[Alias]] purchased Lightning, along with other horses from [[Dimswart Manor]] in [[Cormyr]].\n\nLightning was a pack horse and was purchased especially for its calm demeanor, letting Dragonbait ride it, unlike all other mounts available. Dragonbait rode the horse to [[Suzail]], the [[Shadow Gap]], [[Shadowdale]], and [[Yulash]], where the heroes were forced to abandon their mounts while pursuing the Abomination of [[Moander]] through [[Cormanthor]]."
