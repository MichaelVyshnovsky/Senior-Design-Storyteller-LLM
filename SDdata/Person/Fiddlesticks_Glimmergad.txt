'''Fiddlesticks Glimmergad''' was a [[gnome]] musician and a [[thief]] of some infamy from the city of [[Selgaunt]], who lived sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Fiddlesticks Glimmergad was a talented [[bard]] who used his instrument â€“ ''[[Glimmergad's Selgaunt fiddle]]'', to play tear-jerking ballads for bank guards, making them weep so much they never noticed that the gnome's associated were emptying the vault. Little was known of the end of Fiddlesticks's illicit carrier, however, by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Glimmergad's Selgaunt fiddle'' was owned by [[Thomas C. Quirkilious]], the [[dragonborn]] proprietor of the [[Chromatic Scale]] musical instrument shop located on the second floor of [[The Glitter Gala]] [[gem]] and jewelry vendor of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]].
