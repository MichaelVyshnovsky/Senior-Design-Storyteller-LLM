'''Osalra''' was the queen of [[Procalith]] from at most {{yearlink|293}} to {{yearlink|297}}, having become the wife of [[Nasana Melnuthquel]]'s previous lover and puppet ruler of the same city. She was married to him at some point after 293 DR, when Nasana left; she was also a mage of minor skill. When Nasana Melnuthquel returned to Procalith in 297 DR, she attacked and quickly slew Osalra, though she died of heartstop moments after.
