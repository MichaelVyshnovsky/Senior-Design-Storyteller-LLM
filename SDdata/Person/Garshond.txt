'''Garshond''' was a [[priest]] of [[Helm]] active during the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]], and one of the most prominent [[Helmite]] priests of his generation.

==Possessions==
;''[[Helm of Helm]]''
:Garshond was the the first known owner of the [[Helm of Helm]], a blessed [[helmet]] and one of the [[church of Helm]]'s [[holy book]]s.

==History==
Garshond was active near [[Iriaebor]] during the {{YearlinkName|1264}}, defending the region against [[orc]] and [[goblinoid]] armies. During one of those battles, a holy helmet rose out of a battlefield bog and presented itself to the cleric. It was unclear whether Helm created the item at that moment, or took it from the bones of an older champion of his faith laying under the waters of the bog.

Garshond took the relic back to the [[Watchtower of the Vigilant]], his temple in [[Harkstag]]. This successful reunion led to the creation of the [[Vigilant Riders]] during the {{YearlinkName|1265}}, and established Garshond as one of the most prominent [[Helmite]] priests of his generation. 

Garshond took part of many fights alongside the ''Riders'', defending the region against brigands and goblinkin during what would later be known as ''[[Garshond's War]]''. He lost his life in one such battles, during the {{YearlinkName|1268}}.
