'''Gumph''' was a [[hobgoblin]] guard and a member of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legion's surprise attacks involved [[teleport]]ing goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the town's palisades. Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from [[Luskan]] to follow two of his scouts, [[Ennelia]] and [[Braston]], southeast to the goblin fortress, a recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.

Gumph was stationed in the caverns underneath the Legion's fortress, near the cattle pens that held [[cow]]s, [[chicken]]s, and [[dog]]s. Gumph was entrusted with an ''iron wardstone'' that allowed passage into the main structure of the fortress. Lord Ulbrec's adventurers slew Gumph, along with a dozen of [[orc]]s, to gain entrance to the stronghold.
