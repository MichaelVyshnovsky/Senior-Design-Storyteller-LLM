Gumph was a hobgoblin guard and a member of the Legion of the Chimera in the early 14 century DR.
In the , the town of Targos in Icewind Dale became besieged by the Legion of the Chimera. One of the Legions surprise attacks involved teleporting goblins from underground tunnels into the Targos docks. The next attack came as a direct assault on the towns palisades. Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos ordered a group of mercenaries from Luskan to follow two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston, southeast to the goblin fortress, a recently erected fort in the frigid Icewind Dale tundra.
Gumph was stationed in the caverns underneath the Legions fortress, near the cattle pens that held cows, chickens, and dogs. Gumph was entrusted with an iron wardstone that allowed passage into the main structure of the fortress. Lord Ulbrecs adventurers slew Gumph, along with a dozen of orcs, to gain entrance to the stronghold.
