        "mainbody": "'''Makbulla bint Dalmar''' was a [[dwarf]] trader who frequented [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Activities": "Though she posed as a trader, Makbulla was in fact a dangerous pirate who sailed the [[Golden Gulf]] in search of prey on her [[sambuk]], ''The [[North Wind's Fury]]''. Her favorite hunting grounds were near the [[Pearl Cities]] and the [[League of the Pantheon]]. The waters of the [[Sea of Caravans]] were too heavily patrolled for her taste.\n\nMakbulla often resupplied in Huzuz. She also recruited new members to sail with her, preferring dwarves but taking other races if they seemed like a good fit.",
        "Personality": "Though she was friendly on land, Makbulla was an iron-willed captain while at sea, tolerating no insubordination from her crew. She was honorable though and provided equal shares of the booty.",
        "Possessions": "Makbulla possessed a set of ''[[bracers of defense]] +2'', a ''[[Cutlass of the Golden Gulf]]'', a [[dagger]] and [[jambiya]], two [[throwing axe]]s, and a ''[[potion of heroism]]''."
