        "mainbody": "'''Neveris Bikou''' was the leader of [[Chondath]] ''circa'' [[900 DR]], during the [[Rotting War]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].",
        "History": "In 900 DR, Neveris Bikou sent Chondathan armies to [[Hlath]], following the increased political power of the governors of Hlath and [[Reth]]. The two cities joined forces in a bloody battle on the south side of the [[River Nun]] against Neveris' armies, marking the start of the Rotting War. The following year, in the spring of [[901 DR]], Hlath and Reth turned against each other. The city of Hlath was facing advancing armies of both Neveris Bikou and the city of Reth. [[Archmage]] [[Whinonas Ferentier]], the governor of Hlath used deadly magics of [[Netheril]] against its enemies. The resulting battle of spells resulted in heavy losses on all sides of the conflict. By [[902 DR]], the civil war in Chondath was officially named the Rotting War.\n\nNeveris Bikou of [[Arrabar]], and his counterparts from Hlath and Reth all grew tired of the war and ordered their [[wizard]]s to unleash the deadliest of the spells in attempts of reaching swift victory. The site of the battle was the [[Fields of Nun]]. Unleashed [[necromantic]] spells swallowed all three armies, infecting them with deadly and torturous arcane afflictions. This reckless use of Netherese magics resulted in the deaths of one-third of all troops involved, all happening within mere minutes after the spells were unleashed. The battle survivors spread the afflictions across the land, resulting in a plague that put an end to the Rotting War. Neveris Bikou never reclaimed control of neither Hlath nor Reth. Eventually, Chondath granted independence to what was to become [[Sembia]]."
