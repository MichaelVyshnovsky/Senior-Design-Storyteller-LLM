Looming djinni.png|alt=A djinni looming over several pillars under a black, stormy sky. There are a few people visible at the bottom; the djinni is smiling, bare-chested, turned into smoke from the waist down. He has golden earrings, a moustache, and a gap-toothed grin.|thumb|Aeraldoth released from the city of [[Phoenix (city)]]|Cover

The background man's face is a grotesque caricature, with almost no connection between the features; he seems to disappear below the ribs, replaced by a flame.|In Battle

'''Aeraldoth''' was a [[djinn]] vizier of the Grand Caliph. He volunteered to be imprisoned by [[Martek]] in order to do battle with [[Khalitharius]] upon his release.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|86}}

==Appearance==
Before his release, the voice of his mental cry was soft and deep. Upon release, Aeraldoth appeared at a height of {{SI|30|feet}}.

==Powers==
Aeraldoth's lightning bolts were far deadlier than most mortal magic.

==History==
Aeraldoth had previous encounters with [[Khalitharius]] before the efreet was imprisoned. During an audience in which the Grand Caliph entertained Martek, his ire rose to a breaking point upon learning of the efreet's eventual release. He learned that all Martek could do was leave a djinn of great power for the adventurers to release shortly after they released the efreet; this could not be a bound efreet, however, as any genie that Martek could bind would not be a match for Khalitharius' power. As Martek begged the Caliph to advise him, Aeraldoth begged the Caliph to allow him to be bound so that he may have the opportunity to confront and battle Khalitharius; afterwards he volunteered to let himself be bound.

While imprisoned, Aeraldoth spent a thousand years preparing himself for the battle, though he could not win.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|25-26}} Aeraldoth's prison was a bottle; he could not be released without a magical word, as removing the stopper did nothing.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|93}} The word was hidden as a combination of the contents of the sign on the palm of Princess Shadalah and the Amulet of the Oasis of the White Palm.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|84}} The bottle could not be taken further than a hundred feet from its location, either, for it would teleport back: it was found beneath a statue of [[Set]] in the [[Phoenix (city)|City of Phoenix]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|88}}

Aeraldoth was released only weeks after Khalitharius.{{Cite dragon/424/Martek and the Desert of Desolation|18}} He battled the efreet all across the [[Raurin]]{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|127}}
