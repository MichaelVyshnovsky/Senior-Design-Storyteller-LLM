        "mainbody": "Uluene Maertalar was the high priestess of the Church of Milil in Berdusk, in 1367 DR.\nUluene was a short woman of serene beauty, with dark hair and dark eyes. She controlled her facial expressions as well as professional card players. \nUluene was a skilled actress and singer, which could be attributed to her hard work and vigor rather than any innate talent.\nAs a skilled cleric she was always ready with several battle-spells, which she used to solve problems during parties organized in Evensong Tower.\nAs the leader of the Evensong Tower temple, Uluene increased its power and influence by organizing entertaining parties for the wealthy people of the city. She took full advantage of the growing community of bards from Twilight Hall to provide her guests with poetry, ballads, music and other amusement.\nUluene was known to be looking for a skilled bard to take as a husband. She longed for adventures rather than a life spent in the unchanging comfort of her temple."
