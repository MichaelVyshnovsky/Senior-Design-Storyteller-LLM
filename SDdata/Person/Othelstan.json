If forced to use ranged attacks, he would throw a spear.\nOthelstan controlled Parnast during the Tyranny of the Dragons when the mobile Skyreach Castle was just over the village. He briefly met with the Black Wyrmspeaker Rezmir when she arrived in the village in transit to the castle. He was likely defeated soon after by a band of adventures hired to stop the Cult."
