        "mainbody": "'''Clever Jake''' was a [[human]] [[adventurer]] and member of the [[Emerald Swords]] company. He was remarkable for his lack of redeeming qualities.",
        "Personality": "Clever Jake had an overinflated sense of himself, and thought himself quite clever. In actuality, he was extraordinarily dim and tended to annoy those around him.",
        "Possessions": "Clever Jake wore [[chain mail]] and carried a [[horseman's mace]]. He somehow possessed a ''[[helm of brilliance]]'', which was the sole reason the Emerald Swords allowed him to stay in the group.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], Clever Jake and the Emerald Swords were guests at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. They conspired to kidnap Lord [[Partic Thistle]] and hand him over to [[Zhentil Keep]] for questioning, and had [[Xixis]] the [[doppelganger]] impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, [[Gandegar Armstrong]] had [[Haridyn Storm]] kill Xixis with a ''[[dagger of venom]]'', so that the Lord's murder would cover up his kidnapping. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes."
