        "mainbody": "Clever Jake was a human adventurer and member of the Emerald Swords company. He was remarkable for his lack of redeeming qualities.\nClever Jake had an overinflated sense of himself, and thought himself quite clever. In actuality, he was extraordinarily dim and tended to annoy those around him.\nClever Jake wore chain mail and carried a horsemans mace. He somehow possessed a helm of brilliance, which was the sole reason the Emerald Swords allowed him to stay in the group.\nIn 1369 DR, Clever Jake and the Emerald Swords were guests at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. They conspired to kidnap Lord Partic Thistle and hand him over to Zhentil Keep for questioning, and had Xixis the doppelganger impersonate Lord Thistle to allow them to escape without suspicion. When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis with a dagger of venom, so that the Lords murder would cover up his kidnapping. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes."
