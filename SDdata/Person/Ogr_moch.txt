'''Ogrémoch''' ({{Pronounce|O|gre|mokh|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}} {{Pronounce|OH|gray|mock|alt=yes|refs= was a powerful [[archomental]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]].
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
Ogrémoch was described as a {{SI|50|ft}} tall humanoid made of rock and crystal. His eyes resembled chipped [[obsidian]] and his body sparkled with [[mica]]. This was by no means an accurate description however, as few could claim to have ever seen him.

==Abilities==
Among his numerous powers, Ogrémoch could sunder a piece of his rocky body and animate it into the form of a [[gargoyle]].

He gained additional power within the presence of an [[elemental node]], using them as a means to travel to the [[Prime Material plane]].

==Possessions==
The [[Earth (element)|elemental]] [[war pick]] ''[[Ironfang (war pick)|Ironfang]]'' was imbued with a portion of Ogrémoch's power.

==Domain==
Ogrémoch made his lair within the Plane of Earth, in a fortress known as [[Stonemire]], on a plateau near the border with the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Magma]]. The heat was unbearable and fountains of molten stone, smoke and steam were used as decoration. Tales told of the foundations of the fortress being the entombed bodies of Ogrémoch's still-living enemies.

==Personality==
Ogrémoch was wholly selfish, regarding all the wealth within the earth as his own. This was not because he needed the wealth, but because of the principle of the thing. What he could not crush under his massive form, he outlasted.

==Relationships==
Ogrémoch's greatest desire was to destroy [[Sunnis]], his good-aligned counterpart.

He was venerated by the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] and their prophet [[Marlos Urnrayle]]. The cave system known as the [[Black Geode]] was formed to closely resemble Ogrémoch's domain.

==History==
During the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]], in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Ogrémoch allied himself with the [[drow]] [[Sendai]] and took up temporary residence within her enclave in southern [[Tethyr]].

Circa the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the Cult of the Black Earth attempted to summon Ogrémoch to [[Faerûn]] by means of an ''[[portal|earth portal]]'' within the Black Geode caverns.
