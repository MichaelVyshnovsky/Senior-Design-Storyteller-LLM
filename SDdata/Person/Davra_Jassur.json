        "mainbody": "avra Jassur was an assassin and a member of the Zhentarim in the late 15 century DR.\nDavras job for the Zhentarim was to recruit promising valuable assets, but she also silenced those who were possible weaknesses to the organization.\nCirca 1486 DR, Davra was the Zhentarim delegate to King Bruenor Battlehammer of Gauntlgrym. She was sent to discuss the madness spreading in the Underdark, offering access to Zhentarim outposts in Mantol-Derith but for a price.\nDavra was a pragmatic individual, who valued order and discipline as well as drive and ambition above all. She lived to embody those traits."
