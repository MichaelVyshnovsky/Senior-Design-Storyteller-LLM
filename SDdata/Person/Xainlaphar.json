        "mainbody": "'''Xainlaphar''' was a mad [[mage]] and one of the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], who lived in the 9{{th}} and 10{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "History": "Xainlaphar's place in history was cemented by his proclivity for turning the heads of his slain enemies into [[enchanted]] items later to be named ''[[Xainlaphar's flying skull]]s''. These magic weapons functioned in a similar manner to the ''[[skull trap]]'' [[spell]] but offensively. Xainlaphar created a number of these skulls before dying in the {{YearlinkName|913}}, leaving behind more than a half of the total number unused. Soon after, ''Xainlaphar's flying skulls'' were claimed by Xainlaphar's enemiesâ€”a [[cleric]] and a [[paladin]] of [[Helm]]. The [[Helmite]]s intended to destroy these foul weapons, but at least forty of the ''flying skulls'' were stolen on the way to [[Sembia]]. Xainlaphar's legacy still existed as of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}."
