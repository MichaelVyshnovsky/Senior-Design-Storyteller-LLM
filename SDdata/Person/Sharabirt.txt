'''Sharabirt''' was a [[wizard]] from [[Calimport]] in [[Calimshan]], of the 13th century [[DR]].

==History==
Sharabirt accepted [[Glaragama Dunrohiyr]] as an apprentice. Sharabirt later died, apparently of natural causes, and Glaragama switched the apprenticeship to [[Rrestel]] of [[Athkatla]].With Glaragama's subterfuge and later murderous ways, it is possible that Glaragama arranged Sharabirt's death.
