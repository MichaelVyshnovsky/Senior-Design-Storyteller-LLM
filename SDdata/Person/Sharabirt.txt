Sharabirt was a wizard from Calimport in Calimshan, of the 13th century DR.
Sharabirt accepted Glaragama Dunrohiyr as an apprentice. Sharabirt later died, apparently of natural causes, and Glaragama switched the apprenticeship to Rrestel of Athkatla.With Glaragamas subterfuge and later murderous ways, it is possible that Glaragama arranged Sharabirts death.
