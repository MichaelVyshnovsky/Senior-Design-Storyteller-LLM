'''Garlena''', or '''Sister Garlena''', was a [[cleric]] of [[Helm]] at [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Amn]].

The god Helm gave Garlena and her fellow knights the task of sealing [[Demogorgon]] inside the keep. Knowing it was a difficult mission, her leader, [[Odren]], recruited [[Gorion's Ward]] to work for him. Garlena helped Gorion's Ward get equipped to enter the keep.<ref>
