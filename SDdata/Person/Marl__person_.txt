'''Marl''' was a farmer who lived in [[Beregost]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime around [[1368 DR]], Marl's son [[Kennair Nethalin]] was inspired by adventures passing through Beregost, and set out to make the [[Sword Coast]] a safer place for others. He died at some point during his journey, though the exact circumstances were unknown.

Marl became despondent after Kennair's passing, and started drinking heavily at [[Feldepost's Inn]] along with his friend [[Dunkin]].

==Personality==
Marl became something of a drunk following the loss of his son. He held on to his anger and directed it towards [[adventurer]]s, especially those that came to Beregost.
