'''Gobo''' was the [[myoshu]] of a very small village in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In 1357 DR, Gobo's village was visited by [[sohei]] of the [[Black Temple]], who asked for a payment of rent. Gobo had never heard of this temple and refused to pay, and sent a message to the [[jito]] of [[Tosa]] for support. Afterward, despite the presence of some adventurers in the village, a large group of sohei attacked and executed Gobo for his lack of cooperation.

==Personality==
Gobo was by nature stingy and manipulative. He was subservient to rich people or local officials, but to all others he was stern and inhospitable.
