'''Matilda the White Lady''' was one of the retired adventurers inhabiting [[Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers]] sometime in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Matilda was a {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} tall tough woman of {{SI|130|lb|k|long=yes}}. Her hair was silvered with age and eyes - blue. The White Lady had a blustering personality in contrast to her subdued and quiet husband.

==Possessions==
In her long life, the White Lady accumulated some impressive magic items: an [[enchanted]] ''+2 [[white chain mail]]'', a magical ''+1'' [[shield]], and wielded a ''[[scimitar of speed]]''. She carried ''[[potions of extra healing]]'', ''[[potions of hill giant strength]]'', and ''[[potions of speed]]'', all of some dubious potency due to being created forty years prior.

The White Lady was an avid reader of the ''[[Good Castlekeeping]]'' monthly periodical.

==Abilities==
Matilda was fluent in several languages: [[Common]], [[Elvish]], and [[Orcish]]. As a [[fighter]], she specialized in battling with [[scimitar]]s and was trained to wield [[flail]]s, [[lance]]s, [[spear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and more exotic [[bastard sword]]s. The White Lady had impressive endurance, could battle blinded, and was a capable horseback rider, swimmer, and a talented needle-point seamstress.

==History==
Matilda the White Lady and her husband of forty years, [[Henry the Shadow Master]], retired to Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers together. [[Nellie Thursday]] became Matilda's good friend for the entire thirty years the couple spent at the kingly [[dwarf]]'s retirement community. After retirement, Matilda managed to achieve a great feat â€“ convincing Henry to stop smoking. The two enjoyed the time at Nellie Thursday, its elegant lodgings, and even a training area where the eighty-nine-year-old adventuress worked out to maintain her physique.

Matilda the White Lady and her husband joined several other aging adventurers on a quest that ended up dragging them across several worlds, including{{Cite polyhedron/72/Experience Preferred, Part One|11}} the jungles of [[Quorsit]];{{Cite polyhedron/73/Experience Preferred, Part Two|7}} and the [[demi-plane]] of [[Kansas]], where she faced a powerful fighter [[Maralix]] in a duel and survived.{{Cite polyhedron/74/Experience Preferred, Part III|16}}
