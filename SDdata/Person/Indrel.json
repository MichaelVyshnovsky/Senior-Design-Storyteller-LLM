Upon witnessing her death, Indrel revealed that portents from [[Bane]], confirmed by the same portents from [[Shar]], were that the coming year, the {{yearlinkName|1358}} would be a peaceful year, adequate to regroup and rebuild their strength. The red wizard told him afterwards to tell Lord Bane that he was willing to give much himself for power such as spellfire."
