Lady Lythis Phylund (born Lythis Mhairuun) was the last heir of the Mhairuun family in Waterdeep as of the . She married Lord Urtos Phylund II in the .
Lady Lythis was an aristocrat with many years of experience moving in the social circles of Waterdeeps nobility. She comported herself with dignity and poise.
She was a skilled businesswoman and handled most aspects of the family businessâ€”dealing with wealthy clients in the market for trained watchspiders.
She and her husband worked together on a breeding program to improve and enhance watchspiders.
Lady Lythis married Urtos Phylund II and had three sons by him, the eldest being Tarnos. She was dispassionately tolerant of her stepmother-in-law, Aridarye Phylund, although she bristled at the perceived injustice of the decision by the Lords of Waterdeep to disqualify her and Urtoss children as potential heirs to the Phylund fortunes in favor of Aridaryes son Urtos III.
The Mhairuuns came to Waterdeep from Tashalar in the early 1300s DR and Lythis was likely born and raised in Waterdeep. She met Urtos II in the , while dealing with the Phylund family for watchspiders and was immediately enamored with him. It took eleven years for him to openly express his love for her and they planned to wed in the 1366 DR.
Less than two tendays before the wedding, Lythis playfully followed Urtos to the Phylund Hunting Lodge on one of his mysterious jaunts to Ardeep Forest, only to discover that he was hiding a secret affliction lycanthropy. but Lythis was nonetheless shocked at her betrotheds condition. After a heartfelt discussion, she accepted this new aspect of her lover with aplomb and the wedding proceeded as planned.
Her eldest son, Tarnos, was born in 1367 DR or early 1368 DR, and she gave birth to at least one more boy by 1372 DR. She and Urtos had at least three children in total, but none of them were allowed to inherit the family title, presumably because of the possibility that they were tainted with their fathers affliction.
Lythis was laid to rest in the Phylund family crypts beneath the Lodge.
Speculation on the Mhairuun and Phylund watchspider breeding program suggested that new variants of huge spiders were being developed. Possibilities included creatures that could spin webs that paralyzed victims on contact and smaller, obedient versions of sword spiders.
