Norrin Blackgrove was a bard from Thentia and one of the leaders of the Golden Gauntlets adventuring company.
Norrin was stoic, grim, and unemotional. He lacked a sense of humor and specialized in reading grim poetry.
Norrin was a blade and as such a deadly combatant in close-quarters with his sickle and dagger. His bardic abilities also allowed him to cast certain spells that gave him an added edge in combat.
As an experienced adventurer, he had an array of magical items to aid him. He possessed bracers of defense, a ring of blinking, a magical sickle, and a magical dagger.
In 1369 DR he attended a royal party at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail alongside his companion Ruben Armand St. James II, when Lord Partic Thistle was seemingly murdered. The word of his paladin friend Ruben was enough to keep him above suspicion.
