'''Cardinal''' was a gelding that was stabled in the town of [[Parnast]] for a time during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
''Circa'' the mid-1360s DR, Cardinal along with five other horses, [[Bandy]], [[Ebony (horse)|Ebony]], [[Fowler (horse)|Fowler]], [[Hopper]], were being kept the traveling company of [[Druhallen]], [[Galimer]], the guardswoman [[Rozt'a]], and the young rogue named [[Tiep]]. Cardinal himself served as the regular mount for the charismatic Galimer.

In the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, the group traveled through the [[Greypeak Mountains]] on an expedition that proved disastrous for some of their party. Cardinal was walking down the mountain path leading down towards the bog in the center of the mountains, when he got poor footing and fell into a steep-sided gorge. Druhallen was forced to climb down and end Cardinal's suffering,
