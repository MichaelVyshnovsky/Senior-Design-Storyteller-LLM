Taking up the life of a priest, Noradnar sought to teach others some means of defending themselves that didnt violate the Churchs tenant of passive resistance.\nEventually Noradnar founded a hermitage out in the arid Calim Desert. There he taught a defensive style of martial arts, focused around disarming and disabling ones opponents, which would continue to be taught long after he passed away."
