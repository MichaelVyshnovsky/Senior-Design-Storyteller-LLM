        "mainbody": "'''Noradnar''' was a saint of the [[Church of Ilmater]].",
        "History": "In his early life Noradnar worked as a [[slavery|slave-driver]], but later on he took to heart the teachings of the Church of Ilmater. Taking up the life of a [[priest]], Noradnar sought to teach others some means of defending themselves that didn't violate the Church's tenant of passive resistance.\n\nEventually Noradnar founded [[St. Noradnar's Hermitage|a hermitage]] out in the arid [[Calim Desert]]. There he taught a defensive style of martial arts, focused around disarming and disabling one's opponents, which would continue to be taught long after he passed away."
