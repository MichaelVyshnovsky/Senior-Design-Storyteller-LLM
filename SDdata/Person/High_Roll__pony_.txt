'''High Roll''' was a cheerful [[pony]] that belonged to traveling "bard" [[Olive Ruskettle]] ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].

==History==
In [[1357 DR]], companions of the hero [[Alias]] purchased pony High Roll, along with other horses from [[Dimswart Manor]] in [[Cormyr]].

The pony was acquired especially for Olive Ruskettle, her being a [[halfling]] of smaller-than-average size. She rode the pony to [[Suzail]], the [[Shadow Gap]], [[Shadowdale]], and [[Yulash]], where the heroes were forced to abandon their mounts while pursuing the Abomination of [[Moander]] through [[Cormanthor]].
