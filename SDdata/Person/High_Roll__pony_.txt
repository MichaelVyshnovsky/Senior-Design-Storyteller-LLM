High Roll was a cheerful pony that belonged to traveling "bard" Olive Ruskettle circa 1357 DR.
In 1357 DR, companions of the hero Alias purchased pony High Roll, along with other horses from Dimswart Manor in Cormyr.
The pony was acquired especially for Olive Ruskettle, her being a halfling of smaller-than-average size. She rode the pony to Suzail, the Shadow Gap, Shadowdale, and Yulash, where the heroes were forced to abandon their mounts while pursuing the Abomination of Moander through Cormanthor.
