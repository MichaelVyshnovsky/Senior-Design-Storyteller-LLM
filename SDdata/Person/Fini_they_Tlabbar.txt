'''Fini'they Tlabbar''' was a [[drow]] priestess of [[House Faen Tlabbar]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Personality==
Like her [[matron mother]], Fini'they was a devoted follower of [[Lolth]] and faithfully loyal.

==History==
Before [[1358 DR]], Fini'they was a member of a lower-ranking drow house until she was taken in by [[Ghenni'tiroth Tlabbar]].

During the [[Time of Troubles]], [[K'yorl Odran]] took advantage of the loss of [[magic]] and attacked House Tlabbar. While making her way to Ghenni'tiroth Tlabbar's chapel, K'yorl ripped the heart out of Fini'they.
