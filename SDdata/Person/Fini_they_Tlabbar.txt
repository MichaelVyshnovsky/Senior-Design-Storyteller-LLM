Finithey Tlabbar was a drow priestess of House Faen Tlabbar in Menzoberranzan.
Like her matron mother, Finithey was a devoted follower of Lolth and faithfully loyal.
Before 1358 DR, Finithey was a member of a lower-ranking drow house until she was taken in by Ghennitiroth Tlabbar.
During the Time of Troubles, Kyorl Odran took advantage of the loss of magic and attacked House Tlabbar. While making her way to Ghennitiroth Tlabbars chapel, Kyorl ripped the heart out of Finithey.
