        "mainbody": "Orten Imdrar was the Magister from  to .\nA middle-aged man, he was burly and had a paunch. His white hair was always untidy, and his face wasnt much prettier.\nHe could cast fly, some form of scrying, and cone of cold. He also knew a spell or had a method for blasting open caverns.\nBefore becoming the Magister, Orten Imdrar was a trail-mage who employed utility spells along trips to protect cargo. At the moment of gaining the office of the Magister, he had been doing a stint working magic in mining, where he accidentally slew Aralagath Tarsil by blowing up a cavern beneath the ground where he was sleeping.\nThough he feared the mantle of the Magister had passed on to him only so that he could be sacrificed, Orten Imdrar eventually decided to travel and see the world, visiting Waterdeep, Selgaunt, Calimport, and some other locations. To spread magic, he scried on mages to find good magic, and then scried on apprentices, most often attractive young women, to decide where to best give it.\nHis career ended at the Border Kingdoms, in High Emmerock he thought to challenge Scsilda Starshield, the Water Witch, and take the sapphires she kept, as well as her home. Elminster, forbidden to attack him, but dedicated to protecting Scsilda, placed a shield around her that would tear anyone apart if they crossed it he then teleported a fledgling mage, Qilder Yarven, who was nonetheless carrying seven wands, into the path of Orten Imdrars incoming cone of cold. Qilder retaliated, and Orten was sent into Elminsters shield heavily damaged, he was finally slain by Qilder Yarven."
