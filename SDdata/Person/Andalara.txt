'''Andalara''' was a [[human]] [[ranger]] and member of the [[Harpers]] who inhabited [[Tilverton]] and the surrounding wilderness in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Andalara usually roamed [[Tilver's Gap]] with six [[half-elven]] warriors, gathering rare woods, hunting prized game and tracking down dangerous monsters and raiding [[orc]]s that weren't caught by the [[Purple Dragons]]. She also helped her brother [[Dundar]] at [[Dundar's Fine Blades]], where she finished blades and constructed scabbards.
