        "mainbody": "azit Gul was the Red Wizard of Thay demilich master of the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR.\nCenturies before, Kazit Gul was a Red Wizard necromancer obsessed with dungeons. He studied many dungeons across Faerun and decided to create a dungeon for himself near Thaymount the Doomvault. The construction took a long time, so Kazit transformed himself into a lich in order to complete the work. After it was finished, he installed himself in the deepest level, waiting for the souls of adventurers to consume. However, over time, the Doomvault was forgotten and Kazit went without souls and regressed to a demilich.In 5th edition D&D, demiliches are liches that have not consumed souls for a long time, losing their corporeal forms.\nSzass Tam eventually rediscovered the Doomvault and thought it was perfect as a laboratory. Thus Tam bound Kazit to his will and entrusted to him custody of the phylacteries of his most loyal liches. During the Second Sundering, Tam used the Doomvault as the main base for his experiments on captured Chosen.\nIn 1486 DR, aided by the Thayan Resurrection led by Syranna, the heroes of Daggerford entered the Doomvault, slaying most of the Red Wizards there and freeing the prisoners. In the end, they confronted Kazit Gul and destroyed him for good, also destroying the phylacteries of Tams loyal liches.\nKazit could create from himself multiple aspects (weaker forms of himself) to fight his enemies."
