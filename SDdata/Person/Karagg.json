Black smoke billowed out of the caverns entrance, and the volcanic heat was almost unbearable for normal humanoids.

The king ruled giant warriors and fire giant forge priests. King Karagg loved gold and would threaten any adventure stupid enough to intrude on the tribes territory, demanding gold and a lot of it."
