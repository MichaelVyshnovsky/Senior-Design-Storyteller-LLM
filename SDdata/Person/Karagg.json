        "mainbody": "'''King Karagg''' was the leader of a [[fire giant]] tribe that inhabited a lava-filled cave within the volcanic [[Mount Hotenow]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Ha! It is your voice that is tiny, not mine! Or are you deaf? I am the mighty King Karagg - and my brothers, and I shall crush you!''|Karagg}}",
        "Description": "King Karagg resembled a giant [[dwarf]] with skin pitch like [[coal]], flaming red long hair, mustache, and beard with dirty [[ivory]] teeth hidden underneath. He wielded a massive fire [[sword]] and wore [[enchanted|magic]] ''[[boots of the Mountain King]]''.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, King Karagg's lair's entrance was located on the southwestern slopes of Mount Hotenow. Black smoke billowed out of the cavern's entrance, and the volcanic heat was almost unbearable for normal [[humanoid]]s. The cavern was a massive forge and Karagg's throne room, its floors littered with beast bones and columns carved of stone rising above the king's throne. The king ruled giant warriors and fire giant [[forge priest]]s. King Karagg loved [[gold]] and would threaten any adventure stupid enough to intrude on the tribe's territory, demanding gold and a lot of it."
