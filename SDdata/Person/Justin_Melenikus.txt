'''Sir Justin Melenikus''' was a [[paladin]] of [[Helm]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] whose mission was to help and protect small communities in the [[Savage Frontier]], especially those between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Sir Justin was a tall man with strong, broad shoulders. He had steel grey eyes and close-cropped brown hair that flowed down into muttonchop sideburns. He was rarely seen not wearing his [[plate mail]] armor and carrying his two-handed [[sword]] strapped to his back.

==Personality==
Like most paladins of Helm, Sir Justin followed a strict code of conduct, but he did not let the law interfere with his principles of justice and preparedness. He was no fool and treated others with respect, honesty, and courtesy. He expected others to do the same. He also had no tolerance for cruelty of any kind. As a leader of men, he struck an imposing, powerful figure who spoke with utter authority.

==Abilities==
Justin was proficient with blades, clubs, and lances as well as etiquette, heraldry, horse-riding, reading/writing, religion, and history.

==Possessions==
He typically wielded a magical two-handed sword he and wore magical plate mail armor and ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]''.

==Activities==
Sir Justin led an expedition of watchers to the [[Mere of Dead Men]] in order to rid the area of threats along the [[High Road]] that were interrupting trade between [[Leilon]] and cities to the south. His forces set up camp in the ancient fortress known as [[Iniarv's Tower]] just to the north of the High Road, where they routed a group of bandits who had holed up there. However, the bandits were up to more than the simple raiding of trade caravans.

==History==
Justin Melenikus was raised on a farm near [[Waterdeep]]. When he was sixteen, his family was attacked by [[orc]] raiders after a particularly hard winter. Most of his family was killed and he was left for dead. Afterward, Justin made his way to the monastery of [[Helm's Hold]] near Neverwinter. Vowing to never be unprepared, he found his calling to Helm and received his training in paladinhood while there. Ever since, he was a champion of law and goodness for small communities in [[the North]].
