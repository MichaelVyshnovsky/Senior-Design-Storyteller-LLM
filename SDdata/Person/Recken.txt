'''Recken the Bold''' was a traveling [[priest]] from a religious order dedicated to [[Ilmater]], who lived in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Recken the Bold was the second recipient of the ''[[Three White Doves]]'', a powerful [[enchanted]] [[mace]] created by the [[priest]] [[Alledec]] in the {{YearlinkName|850}}. The mace was given to Recken the Bold by a certain Ilmatiri [[fighter]]. In turn, Recken lost the ''Three White Doves'' in a struggle against a powerful [[vampire]] near the [[Trollbark Forest]]. Even though the cleric emerged victorious, the ''Three White Doves'' were never recovered.
