        "mainbody": "Xingax was a mighty, undead outsider that originated from the Abyss who experimented with the undead and other dark, arcane magics. He spent some time on Toril during the 14 century DR, aligned with the Thayan zulkir of necromancy, Szass Tam.\nLike other atropal, Xingax appeared as an oversized, deformed stillborn babe. He had small rotting fingers at the ends of his twisted, shortened arms.. From his protruding belly extended a length of umbilical cord, further contributing to his likeness of an undeveloped, rotting fetus. \nXingax was nearsighted, and required the use of an array of lenses, attached to a series of small steel arms to correct his vision.\nWhile he was fully capable of moving on his own by means of levitation, Xingax insisted on being carried by a zombified hill giant, preferring to portray himself as helpless.\nXingax was incapable of love, in an emotional, spiritual, or physical manner, and found the concept of sexuality curious. He was was both intrigued by the peculiar concept while simultaneously finding it repulsive. The atropal believed himself to be an inventor and an artist whose work kept him from fighting or any other mundane activity.\nXingax radiated an aura of malevolent energy that, when felt by others, caused them to experience bouts of vomiting, blinding headaches, and convulsions.\nBefore he had a chance to be born, Xingax was torn from his mothers womb by her mate, though it was unknown if the being was his father. It was believed that if his mother carried him to term and gave birth, Xingax would have been born a demipower of the Abyss. Following his \"creation\", Xingax spent nearly all of his existence within the Abyss.\nIn , Xingax established an undead factory within a stronghold located in the foothills of Thaymount on Toril. From within, the abyssal monstrosity began raising an army of powerful, sentient, undead creatures the likes of which had either never before been seen in Faerûn or had been extinct for centuries. His ultimate aim was to conquer the nation of Thay.\nOne of the achievements of which Xingax most proud was the transformation he had set upon the Rashemi slave Tammith Iltazyarra. He had managed to turn her into a unique breed of vampire and proudly referred to her as \"daughter\".\nDuring the War of the Zulkirs, Xingax was injured by the mortal bard Bareris Anskuld, but repaired that damage with an enlarged hand made from shadow and an eye taken from the body of the slain nighthaunt, Ysval. From these modifications, Xingax learned to wield the arcane powers the shadow-fiend had wielded, such as the ability to summon darkness that shut out daylight.\nFollowing the spellplague, Xingaxs powers were temporarily lost. Rather than continuing to serve alongside the lich Szass Tam in battle, he returned to his true passion—developing new necromantic spells. However, in 1385 DR, he was slain by Bareris and his \"daughter\" Tammith during an assault on his fortress in Thay."
