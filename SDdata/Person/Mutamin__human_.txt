'''Mutamin''' was a retired adventurer who, using his funds left over from adventuring, built the [[Green Griffon Inn]] on the road just south of [[Luskan]]. Mutamin kept some unusual clientelle, but kept something even stranger underneath his tavern.

He had gathered several monsters, extraplanar creatures and undead and placed them in a dungeon of his own devising, built underneath the inn and charged adventurers 500 gold pieces to try and overcome what was known as "[[Mutamin's Challenge]]" in an effort to earn themselves a full half of all the gold Mutamin earned during his adventuring career.
