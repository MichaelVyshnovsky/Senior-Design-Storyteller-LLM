Mutamin was a retired adventurer who, using his funds left over from adventuring, built the Green Griffon Inn on the road just south of Luskan. Mutamin kept some unusual clientelle, but kept something even stranger underneath his tavern.
He had gathered several monsters, extraplanar creatures and undead and placed them in a dungeon of his own devising, built underneath the inn and charged adventurers 500 gold pieces to try and overcome what was known as "Mutamins Challenge" in an effort to earn themselves a full half of all the gold Mutamin earned during his adventuring career.
