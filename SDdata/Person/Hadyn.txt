[[Hadyn]] was a [[Scar Pilgrimage|spellscar pilgrim]] from [[Waterdeep]], in [[1396 DR]].

==Personality==
Hadyn was spurred on by the dream of carrying a piece of ''[[the Weave]]'', in the manner of old [[god]]s. He pressed on in spite of the death of his companions, though manifestations of the [[Spellplague]] could still test his resolve.

==Possessions==
As of 1396 [[DR]], Hadyn carried only a simple [[leather armor]] and a battered [[long sword]].

==Relationships==
Hadyn had once been part of an adventuring party, but they had died during the pilgrimage to [[Ormpetarr]].

==History==
Hadyn arrived at Ormpetarr at some point in {{yearlink|1396}}, after a trip that took the better part of a year, starting from Waterdeep; the trip took him across the [[Greenfields]], where most of his party died to [[gnoll]]s, leaving him the sole survivor. He joined two other spellscar pilgrims, [[Finara]] and [[Raidon Kane]], and entered the [[Plaguewrought Lands]]. There, trying to stick to the [[Pilgrim's Path]], they took a bridge to make their way past the [[Granite Vortex]]; he was almost thrown off the bridge and finally struck by blue fire. The fire appeared to make him briefly stronger, but he disintegrated within a few seconds.
