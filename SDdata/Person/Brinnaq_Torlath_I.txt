King '''Brinnaq Torlath I''' "the Shining" was an [[Amn]]ian monarch of the [[Torlath]] dynasty who greatly expanded the realm.

==Relationships==
Brinnaq was the only son of King [[Rashturl Torlath|Rashturl]]. He had many sons including [[Esmel Torlath IV|Esmel IV]] and [[Jhanos Torlath I|Jhanos I]], and his only daughter was [[Leluia Torlath|Leluia]].

==History==
King Brinnaq led Amn in a period of expansion and mercantilism, becoming known as the realm's first "merchant king."

He died in [[694 DR]] and was succeeded by his son Esmel IV, only for his son-in-law [[Arbas]] to set about killing every male Torlath in Amn, including Esmel IV and his own son [[Esmar Torlath|Esmar]]. The sole survivor was Jhanos I, who returned from abroad and reclaimed the throne the following year.
