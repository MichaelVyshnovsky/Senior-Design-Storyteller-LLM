King Brinnaq Torlath I "the Shining" was an Amnian monarch of the Torlath dynasty who greatly expanded the realm.
Brinnaq was the only son of King Rashturl. He had many sons including Esmel IV and Jhanos I, and his only daughter was Leluia.
King Brinnaq led Amn in a period of expansion and mercantilism, becoming known as the realms first "merchant king."
He died in 694 DR and was succeeded by his son Esmel IV, only for his son-in-law Arbas to set about killing every male Torlath in Amn, including Esmel IV and his own son Esmar. The sole survivor was Jhanos I, who returned from abroad and reclaimed the throne the following year.
