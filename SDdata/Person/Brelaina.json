        "mainbody": "relaina was the captain of the Watch of Neverwinter.\nthumb|left|Brelainas appearance.\nBrelaina was typically dressed as a soldier. She had a Watch uniform, which she kept it in a good condition. She was attractive.\nBrelaina, unlike Cormick, was a good diplomat and thought about her next steps wisely. While she did not want to pester people too much, she expected her soldiers to display some loyalty, competence, and discipline.\nAfter the city guardhouse was burned and the Kalach-Cha and companions started to work for the Watch, they needed to go to the Merchant Quarter where her office lay. Brelaina would task them with jobs like stopping bandit shipments, raiding a smugglers warehouse, and rescuing Fihelis. Once done, she would give them a pass to Blacklake District.\nWhen the Kalach-Cha was accused of being a murderer, Brelaina had a new task to go to Gannish Estate and complete a transaction. Once finished, she would offer a reward. Later, she appeared to be talking with Aldanon about the prisoner that was held in Crossroad Keep."
