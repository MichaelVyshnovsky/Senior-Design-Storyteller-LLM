Amon abd al-Wajib was a mamluk of the Dutiful Mamluk Society in Huzuz, the City of Delights, around 1367 DR. He was originally from Qudra.
The markings of the Dutiful were tattooed on Amons face.
Amon was permanently assigned as a guard for Alara bint Kiras family. He was very protective of his ward, especially from would-be suitors.
Amon wore padded leather armor and a blue-dyed kilt.
