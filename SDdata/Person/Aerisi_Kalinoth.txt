'''Aerisi Kalinoth''' was the Prophet of Air and leader of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]].

==Activities==
Obsessed with the legends of the [[avariel]], she used constant illusion magic and flying spells to appear as one. She was prone to flights of fancy and impulsiveness, as well as fits of violent rage when her whims were denied. She wielded a magical spear known as ''Windvane''.

==History==
Born Dara Algwynenn Kalinoth, Aerisi grew up in a remote castle in the [[Feywild]], where she became enamored with tales of winged elves and often played as one. Her parents sheltered her from the conflicts of the world and denied her nothing, catering to her every whim. It was only when they decided it was time for her to join the greater elven society, and brought her to Evereska, that they discovered that their years of pampering and sheltering had turned her into a spoiled child who erupted into fits of rage when she could not get what she wanted. Though a skilled enchantress, she was dismayed to find that the other moon elves were resistant to her charms.

Dara once again began envisioning herself as a winged elf, wishing she could control the wind and go wherever she liked, able to dole out punishment on any who offended her. When she began to have dreams of an old mystic with brown skin and white hair who promised to teach her everything she sought to know, she turned to the study of elemental air. When her parents tried to discipline her, she unleashed her new powers against them and left Evereska. Her visions eventually led her to a cavern deep beneath the [[Sumber Hills]] where she found a magical spear called ''[[Windvane]]'' imbued with the power of the [[primordial]] [[Yan-C-Bin]], Prince of Evil Air. Realizing that he was the figure in her dreams, she gave herself to his worship. Changing her name to Aerisi, she used illusion magic to pretend to be an avariel. Styling herself a queen, she sought out subjects to rule over in her [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], using her talents for enchantment to sway mortals to her side and fill the cult's ranks with zealots who are fiercely devoted to her.
