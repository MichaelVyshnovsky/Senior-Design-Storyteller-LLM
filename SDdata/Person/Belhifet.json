        "mainbody": "'''Belhifet''', who operated under the alias of '''Poquelin''', was a powerful [[devil]] from the plane of [[Avernus]] in the Nine Hells.\n\n{{Quote|...all will have been made ready for your arrival. Those who still live will be baptized in the blood of those sacrificed in your name. A million souls will hold their arms up and scream your name, ready to embrace their new lord and master.|[[Hephernaan]], communing with Belhifet at an altar.}}",
        "Description": "He appeared as a massive, red-skinned fiend that towered over most [[humanoid]]s.",
        "Personality": "Belhifet conducted himself in a more refined manner that contradicted his horrifying nature and actions.",
        "Abilities": "Belhifet was seemingly unmatched in his ability to deceive and manipulate mortals of the Realms. He readily misled and outmaneuvered both his opponents and those he treated as pawns in his schemes.\n\nWhile in his domain on Avernus, Belhifet could rain down hellfire upon his foes and readily ''[[teleport]]'' himself, erupting in a terrific conflagration.\n\nAs a powerful [[baatezu]], Belhifet possessed an inherent protection form all forms of physical harm and could only be hurt by weapons possessing a strong ''+3 [[item enchantment|enchantment]]''.",
        "Possessions": "The great fiend carried two massive [[blade]]s, that he wielded with absolute savagery when he chose to engage his foes in physical combat.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Basalt Tower.png|thumb|right|300px|The [[Basalt Tower]], Belhifet's domain in [[Avernus]]]]\nThroughout his existence, Belhifet was seemingly always driven by his pride. He spent centuries waging war against a single opponent, then sought revenge on his own home [[plane of existence]] after suffering banishment.",
        "Relationships": "Belhifet had an ages-old feud with the being [[Yxunomei]], a [[marilith]] from [[the Abyss]]. The two adversaries waged a war with one another so profound that it led to Belhifet's banishment from the [[Nine Hells]].\n\nDuring his campaign against the [[Ten Towns]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], Belhifet committed great acts of evil, impregnating  many mortal [[human]] and [[elven]] women with his spawn and seducing a band of lieutenants to serve his unholy cause. Among his most fervent devotees were the renegade [[elf]] [[Ilmadia Bariel]], the [[drow]] [[sorcerer]] [[Malavon Despana]], a bandit called [[Marketh]], and [[Saablic Tan]], a [[Red Wizard of Thay]].\n\nBelhifet took Ilmadia as his concubine and sired twin [[cambion]] offspring, [[Isair]] and [[Madae]]. The [[half-fiend]]s carried on their fiendish father's legacy by bringing chaos and destruction unto the frozen lands of the [[Far North]], in their case under the banner of the Godson [[Iyachtu Xvim]].\n\nThe powerful devil was served by a number of lesser fiends, who acted as agents on the Prime and defenders of the [[Basalt Tower]], his domain in Avernus. One of Belhifet's [[red abishai]] took on the guise Revered Brother [[Hephernaan]] to serve as the infernal advisor to the [[Shining Lady]], a part-[[celestial]] military leader who was manipulated to be one of the devil's assets. An opportunistic [[cornugon]] by the name of [[Thrix|Thrix the Profane]] that served as gatekeeper to Belhifet's tower.",
        "History": {
            "Gathering an Army": "With the influence of the artifact in his mind, Belhifet schemed to raise himself a new infernal army drawn from the Nine Hells of [[Baator]]. He planned to utilize a deactivated ''[[portal]]'' to the Hells found in [[Icewind Dale]], which had been sealed within the monument of [[Jerrod's stone]], and secluded away inside the [[temple of Tempus (Easthaven)|temple]] of [[Tempus]] in [[Easthaven]]. Rallying an army of monstrous creatures of [[the North]] and shattering the stone would grant Belhifet the army he sought and grant him entrance back into Avernus.\n\nDisguising himself as a cleric of [[Ilmater]] named '''\"Poquelin\"''' and drew forth followers from an [[Ilmatari]] monastery led by Brother [[Perdiem]]. Warping the minds of his new devotees and turning them into [[undead]] minions, Brother Poquelin formed his black temple in an abandoned [[dwarven]] temple of [[Berronar Truesilver]] in [[Dorn's Deep]] and used the power of the ''Crenshinibon'' to recruit the monstrous army of [[goblinoid]]s, [[orc]]s and [[giant]]s needed to conquer the North. While operating from Dorn's Deep, Belhifet quickly discovered that Yxunomei had followed him to Toril after his exile, mustering an army of [[yuan-ti]] in the fortress of [[Dragon's Eye]] within the [[Spine of the World]] mountains to destroy her arch-nemesis.",
            "Heroes of the Ten Towns": "{{Quote|I am the beginning and the end of this story. I and only I will determine how it plays out.|Belhifet, to the Heroes of the [[Ten-Towns]].}}\nTo stall Yxunomei, Belhifet used the ''Crenshinibon'' to freeze over the trails the led to the [[Ten Towns]] of Icewind Dale and enlisted [[Kreg Frostbeard]] and his [[frost giant]]s to bring down avalanches to slay locals that tried to investigate the goings-on. Unfortunately, Yxunomei's activities attracted the attention of a band of meddling adventurers, who ventured into Dragon's Eye and struck down the demon from Toril, sending her back to the Abyss from which she came. Investigating into the matters at hand, the adventurers uncovered Belhifet's plot and confronted Brother Poquelin in Dorn's Deep.\n\nUsing the power of the ''Crenshinibon'' once again, Poquelin formed the ''Cryshal-Tirith'' around the temple of Tempus in Easthaven, securing Jerrod's stone.\n\nEventually reaching Dorn's Deep, the adventurers managed to reach Belhifet and confront him. Belhifet managed to flee and, in the process, capture Easthaven in preparation for opening the gate to [[Baator]]. Belhifet also used Crenshinibon to seal the temple of Tempus in [[Cryshal-Tirith]].  Heroes managed to penetrate the crystal tower surrounding the temple just as Belhifet opened the gate. [[Everard]] sacrificed his life to reseal the portal, and Belhifet was banished to Baator. He would not be able to walk [[Faerûn]] again for another hundred years.\n\n[[File:Cryshal Tirith.png|thumb|right|250px|...and the ''[[Cryshal-Tirith]]'' erupts in [[Easthaven]].]]\n[[File:Poquelin.png|thumb|left|250px|The mortal Poquelin is struck down...]]\n[[File:Eruption.png|thumb|center|250px|....his body erupts in a great flash of light...]]",
            "Legacy and Return to Toril": "{{Quote|As for the vanquished Belhifet, defeated on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime]], he was banished back to the depths of Hell, where he languished for a period of a hundred years, tormented by the memory of his mistakes, and waiting for the day he would return to [[Faerûn]] and exact his revenge.|The end of Belhifet's story.}}\n\nAbout thirty years later, ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, the legacy of Belhifet continued made its way to the Realms once again. His bastard half-fiend children [[Isair]] and [[Madae]] formed the [[Legion of the Chimera]], wreaking havoc across Icewind Dale. Later in their lives, they joined Belhifet in the [[Blood War]].\n\nDespite his previous desire to gain revenge on the Hells for his exile to the mortal realm, over time Belhifet came to see Avernus as his prison. He awaited his return to the Prime with great impatience, scheming to make his return sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter nearly a century returned to Avernus, Belhifet was provided with a second opportunity to wield his hellish army in the Realms. When the young [[Waterdhavian]] [[aasimar]] [[Caelar Argent]] foolishly read aloud from the ''[[Tome of the Nine]]'' she inadvertently placed herself under Belhifet's subjugation in Avernus, causing her uncle [[Aun Argent|Aun]] to offer his own soul in place of hers. When Belhifet appeared to the adult Caelar years later in the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, and offered her a chance to free her uncle, the paladin from House [[Argent]] readily accepted.\n\nCaelar appeared before the people of the [[Sword Coast]] as the Shining Lady, a charismatic leader that would help them win back the souls of their loved ones lost in the [[First Dragonspear War|first]] and [[second Dragonspear War]]s. With guidance from her trusted advisor Hephernaan, the [[abishai]] servant of Belhifet, Caelar formed the [[Shining Crusade]], a holy army that marched on [[Dragonspear Castle]] and drew the attention of the [[Bhaalspawn]] hero [[Abdel Adrian]]. Using the god-child's own blood, Caelar opened up the ''[[portal]]'' to Avernus beneath Dragonspear Castle, giving Belhifet access to the Realms once again.\n\nWhile Belhifet managed to unchain his horde of devils through the ''portal'' on the Sword Coast as he had done over a century earlier in Icewind Dale, Caelar Argent and the company of adventurers led by Abdel Adrian ventured into Avernus and assailed the Basalt Tower itself. Finally confronted within his home plane of existence, Belhifet wielded the entirety of his infernal power against his those that dared get in his way. He unleashed his devils upon the intruding mortals and struck them down with hellfire in a great battle on the roof of the Basalt Tower. While Caelar Argent's ultimate fate was unknown, Belhifet was struck down by the heroes in his own domain. Like all devils, once Belhifet was slain within the [[Nine Hells]] his last defeat led to final death."
