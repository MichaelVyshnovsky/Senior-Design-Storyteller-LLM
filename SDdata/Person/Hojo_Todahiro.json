        "mainbody": "'''Hojo Todahiro''' was the exiled former [[shogun]] of [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "History": "Todahiro was the son of shogun [[Hojo Kikutake]]. In [[1341 DR]], when Todahiro was seventeen, his father died following a fall from his horse. Immediately thereafter, controversy arose over who should succeed as shogun. Because Todahiro was not yet of age, a shikken regent was required. If he were to succeed his father as shogun, then the shikken would rule for only a short while; conversely, if Todahiro's two-year-old son were to be appointed, then the shikken would be in power for many years. This division soon proved violent, and the [[Hojo War]] began in [[1342 DR]].  \n\nFollowing his defeat, Todahiro and his supporters were exiled to the island of [[Kanshu]], and the young [[Hojo Kawakubo]] became shogun.\n\nManipulated by his mother [[Hojo Haru]] and her father, the [[shikken]] [[Takenaka Okawa]], the new shogun was from the beginning merely a puppet to the true rulers of Kozakura. \n\nTodahiro plotted to reclaim his position, but he was kept under the watch of Lord [[Betsui Kando]], and observed by spies of all factions.\n\nIn [[1347 DR]], Hojo Todahiro convened his fleet at the island of [[Norinoshima]], utilizing the island as a gathering point to regroup and reorganize his allied armies following a series of inconclusive land and sea skirmishes. However, before the combined forces could fully assemble for a decisive campaign, they were taken by surprise when [[Takenaka Sugawara]] led a fleet of ships and men against them. The ensuing battle on the island marked the end of the Hojo War, resulting in the defeat of Hojo Todahiro's forces."
