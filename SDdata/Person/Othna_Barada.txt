Othna Barada was a priestess of Tempus and guest of The Redmark inn in the town of Harrowdale in 1367 DR.
Othna lashed out at anyone who questioned her.
During her stay at the Redmark, Othna rummaged through her quarters, and even dismantled parts of it, as if looking for something.
Othna always wore a pair of wickedly spiked gauntlets.
