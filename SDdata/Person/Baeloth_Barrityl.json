I have no qualms about vaporizing a few of those abrasive curs, but they have an irritating habit of attacking in large numbers.''|Baeloth Barrityl}}<br/>\nBaeloth was extremely confident, counting himself among the top five [[spellcaster]]s on [[Toril]].\n\nHe had the affectation of using excessive alliteration when addressing others.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pits]] defeated all of the combatants within the Black Pits. Baeloth himself grew tired of their success and faced them in combat alongside his allies [[Thardek]] and [[Elan Garaq]]. The Champion defeated Baeloth in battle and freed the rest of the slaves from the ''geases'' placed on them by Baeloth. \n\nHis death triggered a contingent ''[[wish]]'' placed upon him by [[Najim]] – the [[djinn]] had in fact banished the recently-deceased Baeloth to the topside of [[Toril]], in the [[Sword Coast]] region of [[Faerûn]]. \n\nBy [[Uktar]] of that year he had tried to establish a new fighting 'Black Pits' arena at spot very near the [[Coast Way crossing]]. Among his combatants were an [[ankheg]], a [[basilisk]], and a [[goblin]] [[shaman]] named [[M'Khiin Grubdoubler]]."
