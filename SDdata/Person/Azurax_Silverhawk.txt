'''Azurax Silverhawk''' was a famed [[archmage]] and [[planewalker]] of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Azurax searched for a ''[[philosopher's stone]]''.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], Azurax bought up vast tracts of land in the [[Hills of Maerth]] in [[Chessenta]]. He later created three suits of [[animated armor]] and a special "tilting platform" for training [[fighter]]s that were gifted to his niece [[Angel Silverhawk]]. Late in life he turned to a life of [[evil]] and became estranged from the rest of his family.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Ice Mage Cometh|8}}
