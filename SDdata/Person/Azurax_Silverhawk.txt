Azurax Silverhawk was a famed archmage and planewalker of the midâ€“14 century DR.
Azurax searched for a philosophers stone.
Circa 1357 DR, Azurax bought up vast tracts of land in the Hills of Maerth in Chessenta. He later created three suits of animated armor and a special "tilting platform" for training fighters that were gifted to his niece Angel Silverhawk. Late in life he turned to a life of evil and became estranged from the rest of his family.
