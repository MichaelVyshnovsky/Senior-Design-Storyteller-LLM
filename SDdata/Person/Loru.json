        "mainbody": "oru was a conniving and ambitious death slaad who masqueraded as a monk of the Old Order in attempts to breed an army of slaadi in 1372 DR.\nIn his human guise, he appeared kindly and, figuratively, radiated serenity and calm. His head was shaved, and he wore simple robes to imitate a monk. In his natural form, he had black slaadi amphibian skin and bony spikes perturbing from his body.\nLoru perceived the language and culture of the humanoids from Tori to be primitive and the folk - nothing but children, sheep, slaughter fodder.\nIn battle, the death slaad was a dangerous opponent. He had access to a wide variety of spells and was able to summon red slaadi as reinforcements when in danger.\nLoru kept a journal that was written in Slaad and Common languages that he kept in a locked chest by his bedroll. Another item of note in his possession was a lit of a broken enchanted ice blade.\nLoru arrived on Toril sometime in 1372 or 1371 DR. He quickly absorbed the mannerisms and Common language of the people of the Prime Material plane. In his guise of a harmless and humble monk man, his mind even started to think in common, just after several months on the new plane. Eventually, the slaad came across a depressed and heartbroken miller Fernd Krip and befriended the man. Over the course of three months, Loru slowly drove the miller insane in attempts to have Fernd mix slaadi toxin with the grain, spreading the plague and creating an army of fellow slaadi out of the local farmers.\nHowever, the halting grain and flour production worried Maerovyna, a cleric of Chauntea from Daggerford, and she recruited the Hero of Daggerford to investigate the miller. Once the Hero arrived, it became obvious that Fernd Krip was a raving lunatic and eventually found the way into a cavern underneath the mill in which Loru resided. The kindly monk invited the Hero to his fire and offered to share a meal. He claimed that he rarely left the cave, practicing his religious meditations and unaware of his friend, Fernds condition. The monk claimed to be a part of the Old Order however, he unknowingly exposed his lies by saying that he worshiped Sune. With his ruse exposed, the angelic mink transformed into his demon toad self. In the ensuing battle, the slaad was slain, and his schemes of raising an army of his kin - thwarted."
