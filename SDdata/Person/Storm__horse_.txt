'''Storm''' was a roan [[horse|mare]] that served as the mount of Captain [[Halloran]] of the [[Golden Legion]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Halloran rode Storm into battle against [[Akbet-Khrul]] and his pirates in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, during the Golden Legion's campaign. In the Golden Legion's expedition to [[Maztica]] in the same year, Storm was transported to the continent on the Legion's ship [[Osprey (ship)|''Osprey'']]. Storm was taken by Halloran's rival [[Alvarro]] after the latter replaced Halloran as head of the lancers following the legion's arrival at [[Ulatos]]. Alvarro rode the horse into battle against the [[Payit]] and brutally rode down many Mazticans on the horse, both warriors and civilians.  During the battle, Halloran ambushed Alvarro and reclaimed Storm from him. He used the horse to rescue the [[Nexalan]] woman [[Erixitl]] from the battle. <ref>

Later when Erixitl and Halloran were attacked by the [[drow]] [[Ancient Ones|Ancient One]] [[Spirali]] along with his [[hell hound]]s, Storm ran away, but was later recovered by Halloran.<ref> Halloran took the mare across Maztica to [[Nexal]] where the people saw a horse for the first time to their amazement. The horse was taken care of by Nexalan slaves given by [[Naltecona]], the Revered Counselor.<ref>
