        "mainbody": "lrue Crownshield was an adult female song dragon posing as a young human woman from Calimshan in Silverymoon circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. She worked as a maid and shop girl at the Wyrmworks on Many Cats Lane.\nIn her human form, Alrue appeared as a tall, slender young woman with the dusky complexion of those native to Calimshan. She had long, dark hair and typically wore earrings, bracelets, and a necklace.Some descriptions are based on the artists rendering.\nAlrue was observant of her surroundings and the people who came into the shop. She was protective of her two employers, Roryk and Delgrath, but wasnt afraid to speak sharply to them or anyone that, in her view, was acting foolish.\nShe was a competent artist and cartographer, able to use different styles, inks, and materials to produce maps that appeared to come from various sources. She also was an expert in the preservation and treatment of dragon parts, which was the shops specialty.\nShe always carried a stainless-steel flask that contained a potion of invisibility that she was instructed to use if she ever witnessed a burglary or a theft. If this occurred, she was to follow the perpetrators and attempt to identify them or ascertain their location and report back to her bosses as soon as possible.\nAlrue swept the floors, attended customers, and assisted in preparing the bits of dragons that were sold in the shop. She loved her employers, whom she called \"the Old Boys\", but she also attempted to reduce the destruction of her dragon kin by creating erroneous maps to dragon lairs and selling them to merchants or adventurers that would eventually sell them to her employers to be resold in their shop. Her maps usually led adventurers on a fruitless, possibly dangerous quest or left out important details like traps and warnings.\nWhenever she got restless or needed a break from the shop and the Old Boys, she would go to a secluded spot and transform back into her natural form. Sometimes, she would dive at her employers to give them a little scare and something to talk about for days. Once, she pretended that she witnessed a theft and \"investigated\", when actually she just strolled about town listening to gossip, watching people go about their lives, and browsing shops for the latest fashions and wares."
