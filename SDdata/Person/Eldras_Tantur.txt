'''Eldras Tantur''' was the blacksmith of [[Red Larch]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis of [[1491 DR]].

==Activities==
Eldras managed the village's smithy with his son and daughters over a decade and half. They very rarely emerged from their forge. However, he was considered an opinion setter in town.
