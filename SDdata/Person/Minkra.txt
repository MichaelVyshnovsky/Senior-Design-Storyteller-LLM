'''Minkra''' was a notable sage in the nation of [[T'u Lung]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2310|SY}}.It is not specified in the text what field of study Minkra is a sage of, but due to them operating an observatory it's possible that they were either an [[astrology|astrologer]] or an [[astronomer]].

==History==
Minkra lived in the great city of [[Balanzia]], a century prior to its destruction. There they operated an observatory in the eastern reaches of the city, across the street from the home of the [[Fendo Clan]]. Along the same road, to the west of their home was the city market and to the east was the [[Bonaku Boarding House]].<ref>
