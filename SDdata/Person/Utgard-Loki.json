        "mainbody": "Utgard-Loki was the frost giant ruler of Jotunheims major city of Utgard, a son of the giant god Thrym, and one of the most powerful giant spellcasters in that layer of Ysgard.\nUtgard-Loki kept the council of jarls that ruled under him in Utgard in-line through a combination of sheer force of will. and cunning wit, rather than the tactic of mere brute strength that many other frost giants relied upon. Through his prowess as both a cleric and illusionist, he used a combination of divine and arcane magic to protect his city, making it heavily defended and camouflaged.\nAmong the philosophical planar factions, Utgard-Loki was aligned with the Fated.\nUtgard-Lokis magical prowess was so great that over the years he had on more than one occasion beaten members of the Norse pantheon in conflicts, one of whom was the frost giant Habrok Icecaster, who would come to sit as one of his many jarls in Utgard.\nIn the , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff on the world of Toril traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary Well of Mimir. While passing through the layer of Jotunheim they encountered Utgard-Lokis nephew Habrok, out hunting with six friends, who told them of his uncles power and greatness. They also encountered Torheim, a proxy of the Norse god Thor, who expressed wanting their help in a later scheme he was devising to utterly embarrass Utgard-Loki and offered them a coin to give to the Well of Mimirs guardian if they could slay one of Utgard-Lokis nephews."
