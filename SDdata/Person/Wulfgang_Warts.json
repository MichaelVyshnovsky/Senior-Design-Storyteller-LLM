        "mainbody": "Wulfgang Warts was a person in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).\nHe was reputedly a skilled leader of bloodforge armies, but had a debilitating fear of such places as the Phantom Pass. Learning of Wulfgangs phobia, the leader of the Legendary Campaign planned a ruse to lure him there. Wulfgang Warts apparently routed some Legendary Campaign forces and pursued them into the hills, and they led him into the Pass. There they rallied under their leader and faced Warts in bloodforge battle."
