'''Gahlaerd Mossmere''' was a prominent [[wizard]] of [[Tilverton]] who developed and sold unique spells.

==Personality==
Gahlaerd was a sarcastic and silver-tongued man who greatly enjoyed his comfortable and prosperous life in Tilverton.

==Activities==
Galaerhd spent much of his time researching and creating new spells, which he sold to visiting mages once or twice a year for 10,000 [[gp]] per spell level. This gave him more than enough to live luxuriously, support his projects, and protect himself with expensive magical defenses.

He also semi-secretly worked with anyone of low repute who came to him for lesser work, and developed an alliance of sorts with the [[Rogues of Tilverton]]. He provided them with magical services and a safehouse connected to the sewers, and in return they never targeted him with their crimes and brought him magical treasures they couldn't use.

==Rumors==
{{Quote|Rumor runs before us all like a yapping dog that dares not bite. It makes noise enough to annoy but need not be regarded further.
|Gahlaerd Mossmere.}}
Persistent rumors in Tilverton had it that Gahlaerd worked alongside any shady characters that approached him with work, such as the Rogues of Tilverton, which he casually denied. The rumors were all true, of course.
