'''Xaemar Datharathi''' was a member of the [[Datharathi]] chaka of [[Vaelan]] in [[Durpar]] and a [[plangent]].{{cite book/Darkvision|16}}

==Personality==
While an extremely calculating person, he was lampooned in underground plays for his overweening confidence. According to family gossip, he never drank, was celibate, and got on average half a night's sleep per night. He sported a number of crystal [[prostheses]].{{cite book/Darkvision||10}}

==History==
Xaemar played a minor role during the meeting that [[Warian Datharathi]] attended in {{yearlink|1374}}, as the nominally presiding member of the meeting.{{cite book/Darkvision||15}}

Xaemar perished after the sealing of [[Pandorym]] in [[Tarsakh 19]] of that year, alongside all of the senior members of the Datharathi.{{cite book/Darkvision||31}}{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|155}}
