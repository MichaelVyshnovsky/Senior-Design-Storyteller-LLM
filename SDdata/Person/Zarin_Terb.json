The two main candidates were Countess [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] and [[Endren Corrinthal]] of [[Saerb]]. Zarin proposed the candidacy of Endren. After the Council descended into chaos when Endren was accused of killing Kendrick, many drew their swords and started to fight. In the fighting, Zarin was heavily injured. Taking advantage of the confusion, [[Elyril Hraven]] secretly magically poisoned him."
