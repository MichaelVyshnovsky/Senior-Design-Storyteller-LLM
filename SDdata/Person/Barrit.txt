'''Barrit''' was a scholar and [[wizard]] who lived in [[Tilverton]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. He performed research for the [[Puppetmasters]] [[Adventurer|adventuring]] company, and located [[Barrenstone]] for them, the lost underground home of [[Adzerak]] the [[lich]].

His home was two buildings north-west of the [[Whispering Witch]] inn, and he was good friends with the ruling [[Rowanmantle]] family.
