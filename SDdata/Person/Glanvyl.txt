Glanvyl was a relatively unknown wizard who lived in Scornubel during the mid 11 century DR.
Glanvyls workbook was his most notable possession. It contained several common spells in addition to various notes and experiments conducted by the mage. His workbook even included a druid spell which was probably copied erroneously.
