'''Hisan bin Hanif''' was the kennel-master of the [[Dark Wind Stables]] in [[Sarahin]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|24}}

==Activities==
Hisan took care of the [[horse]]s, ponies, and lone [[pegasus]] of the [[Everlasting]]. He completely avoided the giant two-headed [[roc]] that was also housed within the stables. He was completely terrified of the bird, though his faith in [[Hajama]] would not allow him to show it.

==History==
Hisan originally hailed from the desert tribes of the [[Haunted Lands]].
