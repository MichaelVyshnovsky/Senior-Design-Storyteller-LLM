'''Kortyl Rowanmantle''' was a knight and a member of the [[Rowanmantle]] noble family in [[Cormyr]] who rode with Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]]. He was a brash youth.

==History==
In the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Alusair and her knights were operating in the Stonelands, pursuing a bold [[orc]] band that had raided a caravan east of [[Eveningstar]]; in six days of pursuit, they'd killed a [[hydra]], a "[[fire lizard]]", and three [[chimera]]s. They were on a high meadow north of [[Startop Crag]] when the knights impetuously pursued the orcs into an ambush, and a few were killed. Alusair rallied her forces to defeat the orcs and their [[dark naga]] master.

Afterward, Kortyl teased [[Brace Skatterhawk]] over stories he was the illegitimate son of King [[Azoun IV]]. He claimed not to be afraid that Alusair might be listening, and lost his nerve when it turned out she was. She pushed him over to much laughter.
