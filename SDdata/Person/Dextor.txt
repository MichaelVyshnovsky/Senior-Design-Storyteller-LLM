Sapper '''Dextor''' was a [[goblin]] follower of the [[Absolute]] who dwelled within the [[Shattered Sanctum]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Like other sappers and pariahs, Dexter's job was to strap a large keg of [[smokepowder]] to his back and run directly towards the [[cult of the Absolute]]'s enemies.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Dextor and other goblin sappers remained on poised to carry out an assault plan laid out by [[True Soul]] [[Minthara Baenre]]. She was orchestrating a devastating attack against the [[Emerald Grove]] druidic enclave, which she believed housed a ''[[mysterious artifact|powerful weapon]]'' that could be used against the Absolute and her followers.
