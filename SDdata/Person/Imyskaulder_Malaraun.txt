Imyskaulder Malaraun was a skilled wizard inhabiting Yeshpek along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
His impressive beard was only surpassed by his extravagant taste in lavish robes.
Imyskaulder was a kind old man who often gave gifts to children and strangers, even when no one was looking.
Imyskaulder served as a close advisor to the khaldomaun Ilbaerth Malklyn.
