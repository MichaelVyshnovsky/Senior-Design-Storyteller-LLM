        "mainbody": "Neysea Snowwolf was a barbarian amazon from the reclusive Jarnsaxa tribe of Yal Tengri, active in the 14 century DR.\nBy the age of 18, Neysea Snowwolf left her home in the Great Ice Sea to accumulate wealth through adventuring. A proud amazon of \"the Iron-Crushers of the World,\" Neysea was a charming and charismatic young woman. She did not hold men in high regard, thinking them beneath her, and refused to travel alongside such weak creatures. She also showed little respect to women who did not take on a warriors profession. Neysea worked towards her dream of owning a stable full of the strongest warhorses in the Realms.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, Neysea Snowwolf was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
