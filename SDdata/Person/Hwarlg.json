As undead he also was immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stun, diseases, and ability drain.\nHe was a skilled alchemist and had extensive knowledge of arcana. He also was a powerful spell-caster who developed skills to heighten and cast penetrative spells. He knew a variety of spells, like fear, summon monster IV, fireball, stinking cloud, and slow among many others.\nAt the time of Hwarlgs imprisonment, his belongings were locked in a small chest he kept in the same room he could be found meditating, Crypt of Rothilion main sarcophagus room. He kept a small collection of spell scrolls in the chest (protection from arrows, fire shield, and greater magic weapon), along with 107 gp, 445 sp, a jade carved figurine of a mind flayer, and two cut emeralds.\nHwarlg went to the elven city hoping to gain the spellbook of the wizard Rothilion however, after entering the Crypt of Rothilion, it found itself trapped inside by the magical wards and the dimensional anchor trap placed on Rothilions coffin.\nIn 1369 DR, an adventuring party entered Myth Drannor to stop a plot of the Cult of the Dragon and unsealed the Crypt. Realizing he was free, Hwarlg used his magics and abilities to flee the accursed prison once and for all."
