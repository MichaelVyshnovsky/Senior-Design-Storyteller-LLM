Quindy Matrell and her twin brother Obiron Matrell II were the youngest members of the noble merchant House Matrell as of 1373 DR.
As a child, Quindy showed tremendous interest in her older cousin, Emriana Matrells wardrobe filled with luxurious dresses, jewelry, and make-up. Both twins were affectionate with their family and especially showed love for young Emriana.
Quindy Matrell and her brother were born on Ches 4 of the  to father Evester Matrell, who was business savvy heir to the familys trade, and to mother Marga Talricci of House Talricci. Young Quindy showed interest in all things traditionally feminine, very much like her mother, while Obiron Matrell II was more akin to his father.
On Tarsakh 13 of the , both twins were present at Emriana Matrells grand sixteenth birthday celebration, a big occasion for the nobility of Arrabar. During the celebration, they witnessed an assassination attempt on the familys elderly yet willful matriarch Hetta Matrell. The assassination attempt was later revealed to have been orchestrated by a sneak coin cabal that included the twins own father, Evester Matrell.
Later the same year, the twins were kidnapped by the surviving member of the same cabal â€“ Grozier Talricci. Marga Talricci, the twins mother, was ensorcelled to remain silent but managed to write down the culprits name on a piece of paper. Quindy and Obiron were rescued by Emriana and her mercenary aunt Xaphira Matrell.
