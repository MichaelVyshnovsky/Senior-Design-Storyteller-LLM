        "mainbody": "The '''Gorath''' was the hidden leader of the [[Royal Vagabonds]] of [[Shou Lung]] around [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Gorath secretly assisted [[the Old Man]] in managing the activities of the Royal Vagabonds against enemies of Shou Lung. In truth, Gorath was for centuries in the service of the [[Chin dynasty]], a task assigned to him by the [[Undersecretary of the Minister of War]] in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] and he did not always work for the good of the Empire.",
        "Relations": "The Gorath had encountered [[Lui-hsia Chih]] of the [[Many-Hued Peacock Society]] several times in the past and they were mortal enemies.\n\nSometimes he appeared to direct the Royal Vagabonds cell in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]], where he correctly presumed that Lui-hsia Chih was hidden."
