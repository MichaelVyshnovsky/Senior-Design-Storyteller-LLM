When the Guildleader was just a young girl named Astele Keene, she was abducted and her hostage. During that time, Custen Meen sought the missing girl alongside her parents, and when she was returned, he celebrated with the family.\nDecades later, by the , Nine-Fingers ran the Guild with an iron fist, collecting protection racket money from businesses of Baldurs Gate, including Custen Meen, a simple cobbler. When the city faced the Absolute crisis, the Guild faced an underground turf war with a new power – the Stone Lord. Losing territory, money, and manpower, Nine-Fingers and her bursar Uktar dramatically increased the prices for protection. Many could not pay, including Custen, who pleaded with the bursar and with the Guilmaster herself. Custens business was being strangled, and he stated that when the wars were over, the city would still need crafters and cobblers like him. Sadly, Custens fleas fell on deaf ears."
