'''Chandra''' was a [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] and student of the [[Neverwinter Academy]] in [[Neverwinter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
Chandra attended the same arcane theory class as the person who would become the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. Some rumors said that she was attracted to the future Hero and proposed to attend the feast that followed the graduation ceremony together.

==Personality==
Diligence defined Chandra as a student, with numerous nights dedicated to poring over her arcane books by candlelight.

Chandra held onto the hope of becoming as renowned as [[Aribeth de Tylmarande|Lady Aribeth]], but she was apprehensive that such a day was distant. Lady Aribeth possessed all the qualities Chandra longed for: intelligence, strength, and beauty. Meeting the lady on her graduation day was something Chandra looked forward to.

She held great respect for her instructor, [[Jaroo]], who readily assisted anyone facing difficulties in their pursuit of ancient wisdom.

Chandra felt uneasy, because the citizens of Neverwinter harbored prejudices against wizards, especially given the incidents related to the Wailing Death plague. She held the hope that those who blamed magic as the cause of the plague would change their attitudes and extend respect to wizards.

==History==
As members of the nobility in the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] of Neverwinter, her family was fortunate to escape the reach of the [[Wailing Death]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. At that time, Chandra was an arcane student at the Neverwinter Academy. Although she was capable with magic, her life was tragically cut short in the attack on the Academy.
