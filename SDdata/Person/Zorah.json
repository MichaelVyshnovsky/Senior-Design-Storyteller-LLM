        "mainbody": "'''Zorah''' was the wife of [[Vladek]], the owner of [[the Sloop]] in [[Mulsantir]] in [[Rashemen]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Don't make trouble, or else... Don't break anything, and don't get into any fights... or else!''|Zorah}}",
        "Description": "Zorah was a tall and muscled [[half-orc]]ish woman even among her kin. She had a facial [[tattoo]] adorning her forehead. She had a stoic and intimidating face that softened every time her eyes laid on Vladek.",
        "History": "Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Zorah and her [[human]] husband, the innkeeper named Vladek, bought the Sloop. They turned what used to be an unprofitable glorified museum into a tavern and an inn. Zorah manned the establishment's doors, ensuring there was no trouble and handled rowdy drunks, while Vladek handled the bar."
