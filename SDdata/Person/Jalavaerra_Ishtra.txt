Jalavaerra Ishtra was a retired fighter and adventuress from Westgate who owned and managed the adventurers club The Fine Gold Chain in Memnon. 
Jalavaerra was tall and willowy and "famously beautiful", with long blonde hair and large, dark, purple eyes.
She was a crafty investor and was also adept at arranging business deals.
Her club was named after her own nickname, which she received from an incident where she stole a mile-long chain from a dragons horde by wrapping it around her body.
