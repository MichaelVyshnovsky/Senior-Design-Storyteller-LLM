}}'''Talzir''' was a priest of [[Vhaeraun]].

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], Talzir was one of the six [[nightshadow]]s chosen for an assault led by [[Kâras]] on the main temple of [[Kiaransalee]]. Arriving near the temple, Kâras decided that he, [[Gindrol]], and Talzir should [[polymorph]] into [[deep gnome]]s, allies of the Crones of Kiaransalee, and infiltrate the temple.
