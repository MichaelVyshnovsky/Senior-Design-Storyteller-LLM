He worked on combination spells.\nHe was tall, and eagle-nosed.\nDathchchaunt became the Magister after slaying Irithra Dawntanthra while in the way to fighting a white dragon. The previous Magister was already wounded, and when she left the dragons lair, she assumed the mage was aiming to kill her.\nHis first act as the Magister was to offer his life in exchange for that of the previous Magister, as he admired Irithra Dawntanthra Mystra refused, instead requesting his service. Dathchaunt agreed, but was not told how to serve her he consulted temples of Mystra and Azuth to look for the history of previous Magisters. Concluding he had to give new magic freely, Dathchaunt began crafting combination spells. He neglected personal defenses and rival-hunting, simply sharing scrolls of his exploits from time to time.\nIn an experimentation with a ball lightning spell, during a summer storm, his casting attracted three bolts, and vaporized him instantly. Per Azuth, this was a fully natural phenomenon, and Dathchaunt still served Mystra as of the late 14 century DR."
