'''Efteran''' was a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] who specialized in the creation of sleep-based [[spell]]s.

==Description==
The [[good]]-aligned [[mentalist]] was not at all robust or healthy, though she was said to be very peaceful.

==Relationships==
Unlike other arcanists of the period, Efteran gained the respect of the [[elves]] of [[Netheril]]. She even travelled through the woods alongside them, particularly in the area of the [[Far Horns]].

She was keen on recruiting new apprentices. However, she could not spend much time dedicated to their progress, and she was very physically feeble.

==History==
Efteran was born in {{YearlinkConvert|2053|NY}}. During the [[Highsummer]] festival of {{YearlinkConvert|2093|NY}} in the enclave of [[Unity]], Efteran died a natural death, and was unable to be [[resurrection|resurrect]]ed. She passed away at the very young age of 40, making her one of the shortest-lived well-known Netherese arcanists, alongside [[Fahren]].

Following her demise, her students tried to replicate her great work on sleep-magic and spell invention, but they failed in their efforts.
