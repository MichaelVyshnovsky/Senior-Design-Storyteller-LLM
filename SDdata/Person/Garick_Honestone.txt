'''Garick Honestone''' was an undertaker and barber who lived in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.

==Description==
As a devout follower of [[Garl Glittergold]], Garick was ironically not allowed to shave his own beard.

==Relationships==
He had a wife named [[Ranna Honestone|Ranna]] and a daughter called [[Hunnett Honestone|Hunnett]].

==History==
When Garick first arrived in town, he started an undertaker's service, called "The Fallen Man", in a two-story building with his apartment on the upper floor. However, the death rate in town did not generate much business. 

He was curious about why many humans shaved their beards, so he tried shaving a cadaver for the experience. He enjoyed it and found he had a knack for shaving other people, so he split his shop into two equal parts and began to offer a barber service in the other half. His great skill with the straight razor brought humans and gnomes to his barber shop, [[Clean Chin|The Clean Chin]], to have their beards or heads shaved.

After Garick passed away, his daughter Hunnett took over the family business.
