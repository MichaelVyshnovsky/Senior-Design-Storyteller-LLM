'''Hrusse''', usually known as '''Hrusse of Assuran''', was a [[cleric]] and member of the [[Gray Hands]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Personality==
Hrusse was a vengeful, intense, and driven man. He adopted Waterdeep as his new home and showed to the enemies of the city or of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] the same compassion he showed to enemies of Assuran: no mercy.

==History==
Hrusse hailed from [[Unther]] but was exiled from the country by the clergy of [[Gilgeam]] for his "heretical" worship of [[Assuran]]. Eventually, he arrived in Waterdeep, where he settled.
