After a short but bloody civil war, Dempster emerged unopposed as ruler of the proud city and named himself mayor in the {{YearlinkName|132}}.\n\nHe quickly embarked on an expansionary military campaign, seizing control of the lands surrounding Alagh么n all the way to the lowlands outside of [[Hlondeth]].\n\nHowever, despite repeated attempts he was unable to conquer the city, and died in his sleep in the {{YearlinkName|150}}, while preparing for yet another invasion."
