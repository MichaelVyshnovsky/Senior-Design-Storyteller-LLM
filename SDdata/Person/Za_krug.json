        "mainbody": "akrug was the boss of a pack of goblinoids in the Western Heartlands.\nThe large goblin was far stronger and more robust than typical goblins. He wore a set of chain armor over thicker plating that skulls were attached to. He led not only other goblins, but also bugbears and worgs. Zakrug fought with either a greataxe or a serrated curved sword. The goblin leader had grey hair. He also wore a copper ring.\nIn the late-15 century DR, Zakrug and his minions followed a group of humanoids towards the Emerald Grove. The goblins began to assault the compound, and shot dead the gate commander, Kanon."
