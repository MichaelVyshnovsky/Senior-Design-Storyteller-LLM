She was the master of the Five Stars School, which she taught in the back of a bathhouse. Her style of martial art was very adaptable for young women and was based on five styles of movements. Lin Kwan Shu accepted only students who were brought in by a previous high-level student. The final test of a Five Star student was incredibly simple in theory they only needed to pluck a shiny blue stone from the Masters open palm. Very few passed the exam.\nLin Kwan Shu was a slender woman with startling blue eyes, a trait inherited from an ancestor from Faer√ªn."
