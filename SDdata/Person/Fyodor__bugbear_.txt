{{quote|No.|Fyodor}}

==Description==
Fyodor was a tall and muscular bugbear with brown hide and red hair. He wore a colorful [[jester]]'s collar.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Circus of the Last Days returned from the [[Feywild]] and opened its gates to the inhabitants of the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] district in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Fyodor was present at the circus when it was revealed that the [[Cult of the Absolute]] had murdered one of the troupe, the clown called [[Dribbles]], and replaced him with a murderous [[doppelganger]].
