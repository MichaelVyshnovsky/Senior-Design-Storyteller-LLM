'''Gandrel''' was a [[Gur]] monster hunter from a tribe that traveled along the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|I wish I had half the power settled folk think my people possess. Alas, I am a simple wanderer. A simple wanderer and monster hunter.|Gandrel, regarding himself.}}

==Personality==
He was a personable and level-headed man with a good sense of humor.

==Possessions==
Gandrel carried with him a unique [[enchanted]] [[crossbow]] â€“ ''[[Gandrel's Aspiration]]'', along with several varieties of ammunition, including [[fire bolt|fiery]] and [[acid bolt|acid-tipped]] bolts. 

He dusted himself with powdered [[iron-vine]] to ward off beasts or other creatures that may consider eating him.

==History==
As a child, Gandrel once witnessed a [[vampire spawn]] during a public burning. This sight of a creature of the night being consumed by flames and then swelling up, bursting like a [[leech]] and splattering Gandrel's shoes with gore and vicar. This encounter left the youth emotionally scarred.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Gandrel was trying to track down and apprehend the vampire spawn [[Astarion]], and return with him to his tribe waiting in [[Baldur's Gate]]. To glean information about how to better track down his quarry, Gandrel made a visit to [[Auntie Ethel]]'s [[Riverside Teahouse]] in the [[Sunlit Wetlands]].
