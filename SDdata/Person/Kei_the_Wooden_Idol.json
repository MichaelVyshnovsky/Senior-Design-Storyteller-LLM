        "mainbody": "Kei the Wooden Idol was a half-elven rogue adventurer and a member of the Annals of Halgren in the early 14 century DR.\nBeing a rogue, Kei was armed with daggers and a shortbow. She possessed a pleasant and affable personality sharing jokes and jigs with her comrades at arms. Kei liked to sneak out at night to feed her curiosity over what rich merchants had in their stock. In battle, she often stayed away from the front lines.\nKei was a mysterious youthful-looking woman who always raised eyebrows when she shared the stories of her past. Kei the Wooden Idol told tales claiming that once she was nothing but a sculpture carved out of wood. By some mysterious means, the idol was granted life and sentience. Kei spent some time adventuring, evident by many stories she accumulated over the years. The half-elf often exchanged one of her wild tales for a hearty meal at a tavern.\nIn the , Kei the Wooden Idol found herself in the northern city of Luskan, where she joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries, and the rogue happily joined."
