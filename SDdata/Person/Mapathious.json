        "mainbody": "Mapathious was an angel of exploration.\nThe creature trailed off into smoke at the midsection, but its upper body wore golden armor. Its skin was porcelain-white, with icy blue eyes, and wings of what appeared to be magma, which dripped molten rock.\nMapathious was not keen on protecting others, preferring strongly to travel alone the irritation it caused the angel to protect them led it to consider briefly courses of action that were decidedly not angelical. Other than that, it was very curious, and driven to find and discover new locations.\nMapathious bore a flaming sword that could create portals by slashing across the fabric of reality. It also displayed strength even beyond its frames apparent power when pursuing tasks of exploration, allowing it to carry even a trek bell.\nMapathious was used to riding into unknown territory, then reporting the situation to a superior. Amongst other tasks, it recalled it was capable of determining whether foes were massed in ambush, demon lords were riding forth, or adamantine fortresses had been created, and by who.\nMapathious obeyed Neifion as part of a pact between its own masters and the archfey. Neifion could not alter this pact.\nIn  Mapathious was summoned by Neifion, calling on a pact of his own, and by Mapathious true name (Mapathious). He bound the angel of exploration to lower a trek bell into Xxiphu, beneath the surface of Toril. Though the angel was none too happy about this arrangement at first, it was bound its curiosity was quietly roused after describing the location.\nAfter arriving at Xxiphu, Mapathious quickly determined that the aboleth city was actually a fragment of the Citadel of the Outer Void and that it was sprouting. Before it could return to the higher planes in order to report this, it was attacked by Gethshemeth. The kraken soon slew him.\nMapathious often wondered about a place known as the Citadel of the Outer Void."
