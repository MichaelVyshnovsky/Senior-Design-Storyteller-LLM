        "mainbody": "'''Florizan Blank''' was a famous actor and [[bard]] active on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "He had brown skin, brown hair, and hazel eyes. He stood at {{SI|5'7|'\"|c}} and weighed {{SI|125|pounds|k}}.{{Cite dragon+/32/Young Adventurer's Guides: Beasts & Behemoths}}",
        "Personality": "He was charming, flamboyant, and quick to adapt to new situations. He loved art and beauty, and he valued honesty, kindness, and talking to people to learn their life stories. He could flatter anyone into feeling like the most important person in the world.\n\nHe was prone to put on performances even when the time was not appropriate. His unserious nature led many to underestimate him, especially when he danced around them during combat or used [[enchantment]]s to make his foes dance as well. However, he was unafraid to deliver a finishing blow.\n\nHe despised tyrants and bullies, and saw it as his obligation to help people.",
        "Abilities": "He was a dangerous [[sword]]sman as well as a talented actor, dancer, and playwright with knowledge of [[magic|bardic magic]]. He played the [[flute]], [[lute]], and [[viol]].",
        "Possessions": "He had a simple pink [[Mask (object)|carnival mask]] that allowed him to [[disguise self|magically change his appearance for one hour]]. He was fond of using it not only to impersonate other people but also to invent his own characters.",
        "Relationships": "His fellow performers were his most valued friends, and he placed their happiness above all else. He was known to treat his friends and patrons to a [[cherry]]-based [[vodka]] concoction from his homeland, and did not divulge that the recipe was technically a royal secret.",
        "History": "Florizan was born as the youngest son of a royal family in a kingdom far to the south of [[Waterdeep]]. From a young age, he was trained in dance, music, and poetry.\n\nWhen he was 10 years old, he was the sole survivor when the family was betrayed, overthrown, and killed. He was smuggled out of the palace by his music teacher, and joined a travelling [[circus]] under his new identity as \"Florizan Blank\". His experiences living in both luxury and poverty gave him a keen sense of the importance of kindness and truth.\n\n[[File:Florizan Blank - Beasts & Behemoths.png|thumb|300px|''Florizan comes across a pseudodragon.'']]Florizan began his [[Adventurer|adventuring]] career at the age of 16. At some point, he saved the life of a [[witch]] by using his powers of persuasion to avert her execution. In gratitude, she gave him his signature mask.\n\nAfter having gained a great reputation for his acting, Florizan eventually returned to his old home where the tyrant who slew his family still reigned. He wrote and performed a play that exposed the tyrant's crimes and incited a revolution, overthrowing him. At this time, Florizan refused the chance to retake his family's throne as he preferred the travelling life of an actor.\n\nWhen [[hobgoblin]]s raided [[Red Larch]], Florizan attempted to track them into a forest, but had little luck. However, he came across a [[pseudodragon]] and&mdash;realizing that it was amenable to his charms&mdash;considered breaking off his search to tame the creature. He hoped to offer it as a [[familiar]] to a spellcaster in exchange for curing a friend who had recently contracted [[lycanthropy]].\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Florizan was known to be a performer at the [[Pink Flumph]] theater in Waterdeep."
