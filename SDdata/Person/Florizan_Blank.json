        "mainbody": "lorizan Blank was a famous actor and bard active on the Sword Coast during the late 15 century DR.\nHe had brown skin, brown hair, and hazel eyes. He stood at  and weighed .\nHe was charming, flamboyant, and quick to adapt to new situations. He loved art and beauty, and he valued honesty, kindness, and talking to people to learn their life stories. He could flatter anyone into feeling like the most important person in the world.\nHe was prone to put on performances even when the time was not appropriate. His unserious nature led many to underestimate him, especially when he danced around them during combat or used enchantments to make his foes dance as well. However, he was unafraid to deliver a finishing blow.\nHe despised tyrants and bullies, and saw it as his obligation to help people.\nHe was a dangerous swordsman as well as a talented actor, dancer, and playwright with knowledge of bardic magic. He played the flute, lute, and viol.\nHe had a simple pink carnival mask that allowed him to magically change his appearance for one hour. He was fond of using it not only to impersonate other people but also to invent his own characters.\nHis fellow performers were his most valued friends, and he placed their happiness above all else. He was known to treat his friends and patrons to a cherry-based vodka concoction from his homeland, and did not divulge that the recipe was technically a royal secret.\nFlorizan was born as the youngest son of a royal family in a kingdom far to the south of Waterdeep. From a young age, he was trained in dance, music, and poetry.\nWhen he was 10 years old, he was the sole survivor when the family was betrayed, overthrown, and killed. He was smuggled out of the palace by his music teacher, and joined a travelling circus under his new identity as \"Florizan Blank\". His experiences living in both luxury and poverty gave him a keen sense of the importance of kindness and truth.\nthumb|300px|Florizan comes across a pseudodragon.Florizan began his adventuring career at the age of 16. At some point, he saved the life of a witch by using his powers of persuasion to avert her execution. In gratitude, she gave him his signature mask.\nAfter having gained a great reputation for his acting, Florizan eventually returned to his old home where the tyrant who slew his family still reigned. He wrote and performed a play that exposed the tyrants crimes and incited a revolution, overthrowing him. At this time, Florizan refused the chance to retake his familys throne as he preferred the travelling life of an actor.\nWhen hobgoblins raided Red Larch, Florizan attempted to track them into a forest, but had little luck. However, he came across a pseudodragon and&mdashrealizing that it was amenable to his charms&mdashconsidered breaking off his search to tame the creature. He hoped to offer it as a familiar to a spellcaster in exchange for curing a friend who had recently contracted lycanthropy.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Florizan was known to be a performer at the Pink Flumph theater in Waterdeep."
