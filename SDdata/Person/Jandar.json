        "mainbody": "Jandar  was a jeweler and the operator of a shop within the Priador Emporium in the Thayan enclave in the city of Proskur around 1372 DR. He was quite skilled at his craft, and claimed he could fashion any kind of metal into jewelry for his clients.\nJandars work was in such high demand, he counted khazark Chathin Zurn among his clients. In return for his work, she placed magical protection over his strongbox and swore her wrath upon any who attempted to rob his shop.\nWhile he worked at the enclave in Proskur, Jandars wife Yuldra was back in Thay living in servitude as a slave. Her sentence was punishment for the crime of attacking a wizard, despite the fact he was robbing her shop. As it was against Thayan law to free slaves, Jandar was extremely frustrated and had little hope of being reunited with his beloved."
