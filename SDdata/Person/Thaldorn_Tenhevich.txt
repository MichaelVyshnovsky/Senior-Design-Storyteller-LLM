'''Thaldorn Tenhevich''' was one of the leaders of the [[Baldur's Gate]] branch of the [[Iron Throne]] who oversaw [[Sword Coast]] operations along side [[Brunos Costak]], under the leadership [[Rieltar Anchev]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Thaldorn was incidentally involved in the [[iron crisis]] that plagued the Sword Coast during the late 1360s [[DR]]. 

In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Rieltar and Brunos traveled to [[Candlekeep]] to meet with members of the [[Knights of the Shield]]. Thaldorn remained behind in the Baldurian [[Iron Throne headquarters]] as he was scheduled to meet with [[Tar (emissary)|Emissary Tar]] who represented the [[Grand Duke]]s of Baldur's Gate.
