Funada Mitsuhide was the daimyo of Nakamaru around 1357 DR.
Often Mitsuhide was in Uwaji in attendance to the shogun (where his wife and young children lived). During these times was his bother Funada Toyoo to run the city. The two brothers were currently feuding over the next daimyo of Nakamaru, if will be son of Mistuhide of son of Toyoo. Mistuhide was trying to discreetly remove Toyoo from his position of administrator of the town
Mistuhide was a very clever individual but rarely revealed this. He missed nothing.
He was related to the shogun, as his father was an uncle of Matasuuri Nagahide.
