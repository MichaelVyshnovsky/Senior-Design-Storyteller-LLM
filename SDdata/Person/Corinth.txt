'''Corinth''' was a resident of [[Innisfall]] who joined the [[Shining Crusade]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

==Description==
He was not nearly as devoted to the crusade's cause as some its more zealous soldiers.

==Possessions==
Corinth was a skilled archer and carried with him his [[Corinth's bow|unique longbow]] that bore his family's crest.

==Activities==
While serving in the crusade, Corinth was a scout in the Blinding White battalion.

==Relationships==
He had family that lived in Innisfall and was friends with his fellow crusader [[Damarr]].

==History==
When the Shining Lady led her [[War of the Shining Crusade|crusade]] along the [[Sword Coast]], the army eventually came by the town of Innisfall. In order to save his family, Corinth warned the people of the town to flee before the soldiers arrived.

When the army arrived at [[Dragonspear Castle]], Corinth was accused of betraying the cause by his fellow crusader [[Valis]]. While Corinth denied any wrongdoing, he was put before Officer [[Leopas]] for trial.
