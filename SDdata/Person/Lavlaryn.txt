'''Lavlaryn''' was a caravan guard in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lavlaryn was one of the caravan guards for [[Orthil Voldovan]] in the trip from [[Scornubel]] to [[Waterdeep]] late in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}. After an ambush, he was one of the guards searching the wagons for dangerous contraband; in particular, he searched [[Mhegras]] and [[Sabran]]'s wagon but found only [[pele]]s, large shovels meant for bakery. He still kept a [[crossbow|bowgun]] trained on the contrabandists until Orthil Voldovan took a look at these, to make sure they weren't anything dangerous.
