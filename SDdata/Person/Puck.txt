'''Puck''' was the [[homunculus]] servant of the resurrected [[Colderan Morn]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Puck was the guardian of the growing collection of [[potion]]s belonging to Colderan. Colderan also sent Puck to travel together with his [[nightshade]]s to collect information, but he only watched from hiding.

==History==
In 1367 DR, Puck spied an adventuring party hired to stop the nightshades' attacks.

==Powers==
Puck's life was linked to Colderan's own and vice versa: if Puck died, Colderan was harmed; if Colderan died, Puck also died. They had a constant telepathic link.
