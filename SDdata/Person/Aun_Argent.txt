Aun Argent was a devout follower of Lathander that served within the Order of the Aster during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Aun Argent was a dutiful man who held the safety and concern of others in high regard.
He had a niece named Caelar, of whom he was quite protective.
As a young girl living in an Order of the Aster monastery, Caelar bristled at the discipline forced upon her by her elders. Seeking more power, she snuck into the orders library and read aloud from the Tome of the Nine. In doing so she inadvertently opened a gate to Avernus and forfeited her soul to the fiend Belhifet. Aun Argent interceded and offered his own soul in place of that of Caelar, freeing the young girl from hellish bondage.
Auns soul languished in the Nine Hells for some time, until an adult Caelar Argent led a crusade across the Sword Coast in the , in a misguided attempt to free it. Unfortunately, Caelar was betrayed by her "spiritual advisor" Hephernaan, who was in truth a servant of Belhifet. Eventually, Caelar and a handful of her crusaders, closely followed by the Hero of Baldurs Gate and his adventuring party, traveled through the Dragonspear portal to the Basalt Tower in Avernus.
Although the exact events that played out were unknown, Belhifet was slain in the Nine Hells and Aun Argent body and soul were freed from imprisonment. Aun Argent was severely disappointed in the actions of his niece.
