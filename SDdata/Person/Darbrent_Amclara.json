        "mainbody": "arbrent Amclara was a mage of Alaghôn in Turmish in the mid–14 century DR.\nCirca 1360 DR, Darbrent reported that he had discovered or developed a new spell that not only shielded the recipient (not necessarily its caster) from magic but redirected all incoming magic to targets of their choosing. Darbrent went on to demonstrate this spell in spectacular fashion when he simply walked into the citadel of a Red Wizard, reflected all magic thrown at him back on the citadel and its defenders, and obliterated them all.\nNeedless to say, the Red Wizards of Thay set to hunting Darbrent wherever they might find him, and some Red Wizards appeared deep in Turmish to cast off their disguises and attack mages they mistook for Darbrent. It was thought that Darbrent had gone into hiding, if not already been slain.\nThat wasnt the end of it, however. Via a message on a swift merchant caravel to Thay, Alaghôns Free Council issued a rebuke to the Red Wizards, both disavowing Darbrent and warning against any further attacks, declaring they would be met with, in their words, \"might of magic that is certain to surprise even the most arrogant Red Wizard.\" Though the Thayans did not (publicly) reply, observers were stunned by the Turmishans temerity and feared the Red Wizards would ruin the country, but others supposed the Turmishans had some plan or trap in mind."
