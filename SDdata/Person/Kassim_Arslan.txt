Kassim Arslan was the Sheik of the Oasis of the White Palm at the time when the efreet Khalitharius was released.
Kassim Arslan had been the Sheik of the Oasis of the White Palm for more than 20 years before . He had twin sons, Korus and Elkoth, born of the first of his wives.
In , the Sheiks first-born son Hassan became engaged to a young noblewoman from their tribe, Princess Shadalah. However, on the very day of the bethrothal, word came that the sheiks army was needed to fight the minions of Khalitharius, a recently released efreet, to the north. On the following night, the princess vanished, leaving only a few tracks suggesting a struggle which ended abruptly north of their camp. In the absence of the army, the sheiks enemies had grown bolder, and he was advised that they were preparing to move on him. However, the sheik still considered a direct attack on his person unlikely.
Kassim Arslan was a fair, but stubborn man.
The sheik was not fond of outsiders, and those who did not bring an expensive gift equivalent to least 1000 gp. would not be able to gain an audience without a medallion or some other sign from one the sheik knew and trusted. The sheik never spoke directly to anyone but his true friends.
Kassim Arslan used an enchanted shield, but the enchantments on his scimitar and chain mail were far stronger. He also wore a Scarab of protection and carried a potion of invulnerability. Around his neck was a palm sign amulet identical to the one that his son wore the amulet had since become a badge of his office. He was willing to part with three Scimitars of the Sultan, whose enchantment became far greater stronger when wielded against the undead, in order to retain the services of adventurers.
In his tent, he owned four girls who were slaves since birth, and also he had three wives. He had given each of his six bodyguards an enchanted arrow as a token of his esteem.
