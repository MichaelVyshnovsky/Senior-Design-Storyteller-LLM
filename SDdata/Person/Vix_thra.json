        "mainbody": "'''Vix'thra''' was a [[dracolich]] who allied with the [[Valsharess]] during her campaign to conquer the [[Underdark]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Vix'thra established a cult devoted to his worship, under the leadership of a [[vampire]] priest named [[Sodalis]]. This cult was based in an Underdark village called [[Drearing's Deep]], where freed slaves came to seek refuge. In exchange for the cult's protection, the villagers were required to offer members of their community to the cult as sacrifices. Sodalis and his vampire cultists would then feast on the flesh and blood of the sacrificial victim, while the bones would be delivered to Vix'thra to be reanimated as [[undead]] servants.",
        "History": "During the [[Silence of Lolth]] over [[1372]]/[[1373 DR]], the Valsharess began a campaign to declare herself the supreme ruler of the Underdark. Vix'thra entered into an alliance with her, sending undead and [[bone golem]]s to bolster her army. A great adventurer, [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]], seeking ways to weaken Valsharess, traveled to Drearing's Deep and infiltrated the cult. In the deepest chamber of Vix'thra's temple, the adventurer and companions fought Vix'thra, destroyed him and shattered his [[phylactery]], freeing Drearing's Deep from his tyranny and depriving the Valsharess of her undead troops."
