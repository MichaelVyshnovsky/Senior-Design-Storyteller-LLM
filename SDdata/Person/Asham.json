He could usually be found on the streets of Qudra, grabbing strangers and warning them of the \"whispering doom.\"\nAsham was once a magical advisor to the Dauntless Mamluk Society. Long ago while on a raiding party with the Dauntless, Ashams group disappeared within the Haunted Lands. He remained missing for six years until one day he stumbled back into Qudra as a tattered mess. Ashams memories had be erased by unknown sources and no available magic, including that of skilled genies using wishes, was able to restore him."
