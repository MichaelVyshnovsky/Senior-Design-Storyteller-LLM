==Activities==
Rah Kigi Lo lived in [[Y'cho Kang]], the T'u Lung royal summer house. Her smuggling and extortion business was led formally by her two sons, [[Rah Kointo]] and [[Hayu Wan]], who in truth answered to Rah Kigi. She also owned and ran a fleet of river barges and three warehouses in the village of [[Wai T'lu]] just downriver from Y'cho Kang.

==History==
Rah Kigi Lo was a widow who in time had become a very able crime lord. She collected the riches of four men before managing to reach the Emperor's court, where Rah Kigi came to be [[Wai Gada Shinzu]]'s secret concubine.

==Relationship==
Rah's sons, despite their mother's efforts to have them introduced into high T'u Lung society remained two street thugs. Rah's most hated enemy was [[Wai Kung Chui]], a widowed township officer in [[Shosun]], a day upriver from Y'cho Kang.
