        "History": "''Circa'' [[1330 DR]], Hoch Miraz was aboard the ''[[Golden Crown]]'', a treasure galleon leaving the [[Calishite]] mining colony of [[Berranzo]] on the island of [[Gundarlun]] in the [[Trackless Sea]]. Struck by a storm, the ''Golden Crown'' sunk off the coast of the island, and Hoch Miraz went down with the vessel.",
        "Possessions": "Hoch Miraz was said to possess a ''[[staff of the magi]]'', a ''[[ring of spell turning]]'', and a ''[[cube of force]]'', though the latter was thought to have failed, to account for Hoch's doom. These were still thought to lay in the sunken ship in [[1370 DR]].",
