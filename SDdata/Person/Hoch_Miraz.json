        "mainbody": "Hoch Miraz was a wizard from Calimshan in west Faerûn.\nCirca 1330 DR, Hoch Miraz was aboard the Golden Crown, a treasure galleon leaving the Calishite mining colony of Berranzo on the island of Gundarlun in the Trackless Sea. Struck by a storm, the Golden Crown sunk off the coast of the island, and Hoch Miraz went down with the vessel.\nHoch Miraz was said to possess a staff of the magi, a ring of spell turning, and a cube of force, though the latter was thought to have failed, to account for Hochs doom. These were still thought to lay in the sunken ship in 1370 DR.\nCategoryWizards\nCategoryInhabitants of Calimshan\nCategoryInhabitants of the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryInhabitants of West Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nc9lge4eze3esfetqnmo0krlyi9cc8v1"
