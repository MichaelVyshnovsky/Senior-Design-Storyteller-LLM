'''Doomcrown''', previously known as '''Azrokkog''', was a [[hobgoblin]] warlord in [[Arcturiadoom]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], Azrokkog abandoned his parents after accusing [[Azrok]] of becoming sedentary and went out into larger [[Faerûn]] to make his own way. After many years, he came back with a new name and a new purpose. He formed the [[Death's Head Phalanx]] and had aligned himself with the [[fire giant]] [[Emberosa]] and her kin in their plot to conquer [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Northwest Faerûn|the North]] and bring about the rise of the fire giants within the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] of [[giant]] kind. Doomcrown believed fire giants could sweep over and conquer the surface realms of Faerûn. They set their eventual sights on the [[High Forest]]. The Death's Head warlord believed the fire giants could purge the forest and the Phalanx could seize it as their own domain.

To this end, the Death's Head Phalanx protected Emberosa and the giants as they worked on creating an enormous mechanical construct known as [[Mecha-Halaster]]. This 100-foot-tall (30.5 meters) metal likeness of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] was to be used when Emberosa and the "Mad Mage" himself left Undermountain to assail the city of [[Waterdeep]] and defeat its [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|colossal protectors]].

Meanwhile, Doomcrown sent [[Yargoth|Yargoth the Breaker]] to lead an excursion upward into [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] in an effort to steal scrap metal from the domain's [[scaladar]]. 

Just after settling into their new barracks, Doomcrown met a [[flumph]] that became his favorite pet but it's influence caused the warlord to developed strange behavior.

==Activities==
Doomcrown's band of hobgoblins established a barracks and base camp within the south-eastern halls of Arcturiadoom. Doomcrown kept his personal quarters in a nearby chamber. The clan also maintained several guard posts throughout the level, along with a training room and a large rallying area, used for mustering their ranks. Out of boredom, Doomcrown asked his subjects to collect a set of [[mason's tools]] and started to carve blocks of stone into odd, tower-like structures resembling stalagmites.

==Personality==
Doomcrown was a devout worshiper of [[Maglubiyet]] and completely dedicated to the collective goal shared by his war band, their fire giant allies, and the "Mad Mage" Halaster. However he developed a strange behavior after being near the flumph.
