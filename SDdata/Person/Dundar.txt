'''Dundar''' was a blacksmith and inhabitant of [[Tilverton]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Dundar owned [[Dundar's Fine Swords]] where he in fact, sold fine [[sword]]s. By the late 1360's he had expanded his craft to include saws, axes, scythes, and other bladed implements, and renamed his shop to [[Dundar's Fine Blades]]. He also provided training for novice fighters in weaponplay. 

==Relationships==
Dundar's sibling, a [[Harper]] named [[Andalara]], helped him in the shop by finishing blades and constructing scabbards when she wasn't hunting.
