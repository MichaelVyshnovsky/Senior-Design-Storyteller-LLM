        "Activities": "In Miki, a large fishing village that had recently grown significantly, Miki-san's men acted as a peacekeeping force, while the [[bushi]] of the [[jito]] [[Mushakoji Nariakira]] were busy managing the adjacent central [[Niwa clan]] [[shoen]]. Miki-san's men protected villagers from strangers, seamen, and merchants for a price. They also managed a small gambling house. There very few incidents between yakuza and samurai, but they always resolved these with agreements, at least at the moment.",
        "Personality": "Miki-san was only the alias of the [[oyabun]], nobody know his true name."
