'''Victoro Cassalanter''' ({{Pronounce|vic|TOR|oh|_|KAS|ah|lan|ter|refs=}}) was the lord of the [[Cassalanter]] family of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
 
==Activities==
Victoro was schooled in the [[divine]] arts. He was the leader of a Cult of [[Asmodeus]] that involved certain nobles in Waterdeep. Victoro was a priest of Asmodeus.

On the surface, Victoro posed as a successful banker, philanthropist, and follower of [[Lathander]] but this was only a fa√ßade he needed for his businesses.

==History==
In [[1489 DR]],

In 1492 DR, Victoro and his wife planned to recover the lost [[gold]] of [[Dagult Neverember]] and use it to buy back the souls of their children. Victoro focused on searching for the gold while Ammalia was busy with other preparations for the ceremony to save the souls of their children.

If Ammalia and Victoro presented the gold and ninety-nine souls to a [[devil]] servant of Asmodeus in time, then the souls of Terenzio and Elzerina would be safe.

If the Cassalanters managed to obtain the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', five cultists protected the Stone inside the Cassalanter mausoleum in the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]]. However, two of the cultists, under the secret orders of Victoro Cassalanter, killed the other cultists and left one for dead in order to better hide their trails.

Later, Victoro sent his [[doppelganger]] valet [[Willifort Crowelle]] to recover the Stone and return with it to the Cassalanter villa.

==Personality==
Victoro was always polite and slow to anger but deep inside he was a self-interested individual. He cared only for gold and power and for that he sold the souls of his children to the [[Nine Hells]].
