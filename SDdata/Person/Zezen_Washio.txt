'''Zezen Washio''' was a [[samurai]] adventurer in [[Kozakura]].

==History==
Washio hailed from the illustrious and noble [[Zezen clan]] and he was the eldest son of an eldest son. His family had a long history, with his ancestor [[Zezen Ito]] penning the ''[[Great Interpretation of the Way of Enlightenment]]'' and winning in [[1287 DR]] in the [[Battle of Falling Water]] together with powerful the lowland [[Hirimaki clan]].

In the 1350s [[DR]], many of Washio's female relatives married into the mercantile [[Ko clan]]. 

In [[1357 DR]], Washio was among the candidates considered by [[Ko Mei Kho]] for a mission to [[Akari]].

In [[1358]], he was offered a [[shugo]] in his native home vale but at the last moment he went out to fight a monster and kept on going, unclear whether he ever wished to return to bureaucratic duties. After this, he was possibly approached by [[Ko Ho San]].
