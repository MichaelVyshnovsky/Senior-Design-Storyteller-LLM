The '''Spotted Man''' was a retired treasure hunter living in the [[Mistshore]] neighborhood of [[Waterdeep]] in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Mystery of Deepwater Harbor|22}}<ref group="note" name="Year">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki.

==Description==
This man's body was riddled in bloated blue spots that burst periodically, weeping a blue tinted blood.

==History==
The man who would take on the alias "Spotted Man" was quite a successful treasure hunter until one of his adventures left him [[spellscar]]red. Just before he contracted the condition he had discovered the location of the wrecked ship ''[[Ardent Purveyor]]'' and was planning to launch an expedition to loot it. Following his spellscarring, the Spotted Man feared that taking to the open sea or diving underwater would worsen his condition.

In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note" name="Year">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. a group of [[adventurer]]s approached him that were in search of the ''Ardent Purveyor''. After some convincing he informed the adventurers that the currents of [[Deepwater Harbor]] had placed the wreck not in [[Umberleeâ€™s Cache]], but close to it, and provided a [[map]] with some reckoning points.
