        "mainbody": "'''Tebora''' was the saleswoman at the [[Body Shop]] in [[Vaelan]] in {{yearlink|1374}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|109-113|11}}",
        "Appearance": "She was a [[plangent]], sporting the Strong and Tireless configuration, which replaced one of her legs, one of her arms, and her spine; she also sported a [[plangent crystal]] eye. When working at the Body Shop, she wore a lavender dress, which matched her prosthetics quite well.",
        "Personality": "She was an insistent and tricky seller, eager to demonstrate the capabilities and power of plangents.",
        "Powers": "Tebora's eye was capable of some kind of scanning. She was also confident of her ability to wrestle anyone's manservants.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1374}}, Tebora was the one answering the questions of [[Ususi Manaallin]] and [[Iahn Qoyllor]], who had entered the shop while disguised as Lady Urale and her manservant Alon (Iahn being the manservant). During her conversation, either [[Shaddon Datharathi]] or [[Pandorym]] looked out of Tebora's body without her notice or knowledge. She offered to wrestle \"Alon\" to demonstrate the power of her plangent prosthetics; his disguise broke in the violence, and he was forced to knock her out in order to keep their presence a secret."
