'''Old Jol''' was the father of [[Sylai]] and an inhabitant of the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Sylai had already moved away from home and only occasionally visited Old Jol, communicating via letters. When the [[Absolute crisis]] struck the Gate, Sylai heard about upcoming food shortages and sent season's victuals to their father, knowing how he hated shopping for himself. Sylai promised to visit as soon as they could. Old Jol shared a relationship of some description with Kathora and both him and his child had a warm and loving relationship with Uli.
