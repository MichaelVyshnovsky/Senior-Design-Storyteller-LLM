        "mainbody": "'''Resino''' was a young man from [[Beregost]] who became the reason for the creation of ''[[rings of clear thought]]'' some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Resino was just a young man when he became afflicted with voices that incessantly attacked his mind. Resino turned to a local temple for help in ending his miserable existence. The temple's clergy was unable to determine what kind of [[demon]] was plaguing Resino. Yet, the church refused to take Resino's life, instead, it ceased ''rings of clear thought'' that would help with Resino's strange affliction. However, these [[ring]]s enhanced the young man's senses but did nothing to stop the voices. Eventually, unable to suffer anymore, Resino took his own life."
