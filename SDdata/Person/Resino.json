Resino turned to a local temple for help in ending his miserable existence. The temples clergy was unable to determine what kind of demon was plaguing Resino. Yet, the church refused to take Resinos life, instead, it ceased rings of clear thought that would help with Resinos strange affliction. However, these rings enhanced the young mans senses but did nothing to stop the voices. Eventually, unable to suffer anymore, Resino took his own life."
