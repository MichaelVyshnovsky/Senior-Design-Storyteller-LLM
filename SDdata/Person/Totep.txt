'''Totep''' was one of the [[Revered Counselor]]s of the great [[Nexal]]an empire whose rule was cut short by assassination over a hundred years before the arrival of the [[Golden Legion]] in [[1361 DR]].

==History==
Totep claimed the throne from his father, Revered Counselor [[Chimal]] in the {{YearlinkName|1230}}. The man spent his six-year rule in the company of countless concubines and not governing to the great dissatisfaction of the Nexalan generals. They thought the Revered Counselor an ambivalent and weak ruler. Totep died in the {{YearlinkName|1236}} poisoned by his generals. One of these generals went on to become the next Revered Counselor â€“ [[Zomoc]], Totep's own nephew.
