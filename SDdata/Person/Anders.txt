Anders was a human agent of the archdevil Zariel who posed as a paladin of Tyr, God of Justice.
After surviving the clash with the tiefling Karlach Cliffgate and cornering her, Anders took on the personality of an exhausted paladin of Tyr in the hopes of gaining the sympathy of passing adventurers who could aid him in slaying or capturing his mark. In truth, he is a cruel, impatient, and eager servant of Zariel.
Anders possess strength beyond the capabilities of other men thanks to his deal with Zariel.
Anders wields the enchanted sword of justice, which he claims was blessed by Tyr. Though considering Anders true allegiance, the validity of this claim is questionable.
Anders carried out his service alongside the halfling ranger Trynn, the dwarf Rurik, and a spellcasting trader named Cyrel.
Sometime in the year , Anders was tasked by Zariel to bring the tiefling Karlach Cliffgate back to the Nine Hells after she escaped the archdevils service by boarding a Nautiloid.
Anders and his companions caught up with the tiefling somewhere along the Risen Road and managed to injure her, but could not kill her. Sometime around Uktar 16, the group stopped by a nearby tollhouse along the River Chionthar to corner their mark and were subsequently attacked by gnoll cultists loyal to the Absolute, though Anders and his companions managed to slay them.
