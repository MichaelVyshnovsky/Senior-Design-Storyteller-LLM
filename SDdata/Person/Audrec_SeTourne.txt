'''Audrec SeTourne''' was a duelist from [[Lantan]] who was in [[Mulmaster]].

==Personality==
The gladiator was known for his [[evil]] nature. In fights, Audrec would backstab his fellow gladiators just to win the tournament [[gold]], and he would kill innocents under the pretense of a "duel of honor".

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], Audrec fought in the gladiator matches held in the [[Boar Pit]] of the [[Black Blade and Bloody Boar]] tavern. At the same time, he extorted money from a noble of Mulmaster. However, his victim was an ally of the [[Zhentarim]], who sent their agent [[Saerol Danonbryl]] to kill Audrec during one of the matches using a [[poison]] known as [[pale tincture]].
