==History==
In [[1372 DR]], Curnil introduced the [[drow]] outcast [[Ryld Argith]] and [[Halisstra Melarn]] to his lord [[Dessaer]].

In [[1374 DR]], he had finished his training in Elventree and had joined the [[Riders of Mistledale]]. That year, he investigated the disappearance of two of his fellow Riders.
