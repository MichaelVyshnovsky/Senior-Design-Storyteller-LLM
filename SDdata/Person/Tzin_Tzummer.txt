'''Tzin Tzummer''' was a member of the [[Heralds of Faerûn]] and the herald to [[Tessaril Winter]] of [[Eveningstar]], [[Cormyr]], in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
During his encounter with [[Shandril Shessair]] in late 1357 DR, he was unshaven.

==Personality==
In his encounter with Shandril and [[Mirt]], he proved rather unshakable, polite, and fearless.

==Possessions==
He lived in [[Tessaril's Tower]]. He owned at least a [[sword]], boots, and a night robe.

==Activities==
He helped in the day-to-day rule of the realm. Possibly, more than that. He also served as a Herald.

==History==
When Shandril, Mirt, and [[Narm Tamaraith]] arrived at Eveningstar in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, they were rebuffed by the guards at the door of [[Tessaril's Tower]]; Tzin joined the guards shortly after noticing the commotion through his window. He tried to convince the interlopers to spend the night at a tavern instead and come back in the morning. Mirt instead proved himself to be a [[Harper]] and bore King [[Azoun IV]]'s favor, but before Tzin could decide what to do with them, Tessaril herself came down to let them all in.
