'''Halder''' was an [[archmage]] of the city of [[Delzimmer]] in [[southeast Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}

==History==
Halder was one of those wizards—listed among [[Omm Hlandrar]] of [[Halruaa]], [[Szass Tam]] of [[Thay]], [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], and the [[Simbul]] of [[Aglarond]]—who challenged the mortal [[Velsharoon|Velsharoon the Vaunted]] in his wicked plots. In turn, the arch-necromancer worked to acquire enough power to destroy Halder and all the other mages who'd opposed him. In the late 1350s DR, Velsharoon was working on a means of achieving godhood, and Halder and the others feared for their safety and for the safety and stability of the Realms. Velsharoon ultimately achieving godhood in the {{yearlinkName|1368}}.
