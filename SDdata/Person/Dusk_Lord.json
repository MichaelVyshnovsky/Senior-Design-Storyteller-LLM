        "mainbody": "The '''Dusk Lord''' was the mysterious ruler of [[Sessrendale]] in the [[Dalelands]] in the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": {
            "In Life": "The rulers of [[Archendale]] accused the Dusk Lord of various crimes: practicing foul [[necromancy]] or other dark sorceries, of polluting the realm with such [[magic]], of harboring evil raiders, and of causing [[undead]] and magical [[construct]]s to stalk the land, raid caravans, and murder innocents. Such claims might have been without merit, but weren't aided by the Dusk Lord's sinister title. Meanwhile, the Sessrenfolk accused the Arkhenfolk merchants of spreading rumors and laying trumped-up charges over minor incidents in order to justify their avarice. Things came to a head in the [[1232 DR|Year of the Weeping Wives, 1232 DR]], when an Arkhen caravan journeying to Cormyr was attacked, with several families brutally slain. The culprits were never identified, but Archendale was enraged and launched an invasion.\n\nIn the ensuing [[Sessrendale War]], the Dusk Lord and other mighty mages used potent magic in their defense, but Archendale had superior forces, leading to heavy losses on both sides.It seems likely that the Dusk Lord was one of the five mages of Sessrenglade. In ''[[The Dalelands (sourcebook)|The Dalelands]]'', page 47, [[Elminster]] also says three [[archmage]]s died in the war; these may be among the five in Sessrenglade and the Dusk Lord might be one.",
            "In Legend": "However, there remained speculation about the Dusk Lord's demise. Although some believed he'd been killed, It was even insisted that he was there planning vengeance against all the living in the Dalelands. However, none of this was confirmed. A century and a half later, there were few serious claims the Dusk Lord still abided in the Vast Swamp, at least not alive.\n\nCuriously, in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], a number of prominent Arkhenfolk were apparently slain by a formidable [[ghost]]. Rumors swirled that this was the vengeful spirit of the Dusk Lord of Sessrendale, on a mission to kill one descendant of each and every soldier who'd marched into Sessrendale, a number that would be in the hundreds. (However, both the ancestries and the killer were unconfirmed.)\n\nA more obscure legend told that, if not undead, the Dusk Lord enjoyed an unnaturally long life in the Vast Swamp, and that at its end he used his magic to pass into the [[Plane of Shadow]]. There were two intriguing pieces of corroborating evidence for this. The first was a ''[[portal]]'' to the Plane of Shadow located in the ruined keep called the [[Lost Refuge]] (built [[1227 DR]], fell after [[1274 DR]]) in the Vast Swamp. Followers of [[Shar]], goddess of darkness, who occupied the ruins in [[1374 DR]], named this ''portal'' the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]] after the legend. Believing it had once been used by the Dusk Lord, they estimated it had been closed over a century before.''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' page 50 says the ''portal'' was \"closed over a century ago\" (''before'' 1274 DR), but that the keep fell \"nearly 100 years ago\" (''after'' 1274 DR). This suggests the keep was occupied when the ''portal'' was opened and when the Dusk Lord is believed to have passed through. The second was a magical seat called the ''[[Dusk Lord's throne]]'' in the [[Shadow Citadel]], in the Lost Refuge's reflection on the other side of the ''portal''. Although it had no known link to the Dusk Lord, planar lore held that it had had this name for a century."

        "Powers": "Although accused of necromancy and many other magical misdeeds, likely without cause, it was a little known fact that the Dusk Lord was actually a spellcaster with an affinity for [[shadow magic]]."
