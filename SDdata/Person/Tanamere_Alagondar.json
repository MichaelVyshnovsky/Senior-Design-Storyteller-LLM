        "mainbody": "Lady '''Tanamere Alagondar''' was a royal scion of the [[Alagondar]] family in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Not much is known about Lady Tanamere Alagondar, but she lived sometime in the late 14{{th}} century DR following [[Nasher Alagondar]]'s ascension to King of Neverwinter. She was famous for wielding a ''[[Dragon slayer sword|dragon slayer]]'' [[longsword]]. It was said that she and two parties of adventurers fought and killed a [[green dragon]] named [[Azdraka]] that terrorized the [[High Road]].\n\nAfter being mortally wounded in the battle, her dying wish was that she and her fallen compatriots were buried with the corpse of Azdraka in a barrow near where the dragon fell. The barrow was created in the shape of a dragon in flight, and thus came to be known as [[Dragon Barrow]].\n\nAccording to legend, her [[magic]]al longsword was buried with her."
