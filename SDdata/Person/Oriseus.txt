Oriseus was a paladin of Helm and one of the leading Lords of Imphras II who governed the kingdom of Impiltur during the late 14 century DR.
Along with his fellow lords Limbrar and Helimbraun, Oriseus spoke often during council meetings, leading discourse and deciding what they felt was best for the realm. They were a prominent force during the waning years of Queen-Regent Sambryls reign before the coronation of King Imbrar II in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.
