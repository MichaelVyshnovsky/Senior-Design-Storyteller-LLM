        "mainbody": "Ilva () was a maid in Mulmaster in 1491 DR.\nIlva hailed from Phlan but like many others fled her hometown after Vorgansharax began to rule the city. She went to Mulmaster, where she started working as a maid at the bar called the Black Blade and Bloody Boar. Ilva befriended the half-elf Mixi. \nShe later became obsessed with a strange dwarf prophet. After Mixi refused to follow her to more of the prophets meetings, Ilva befriended the young noble Sebastian Stoe, who agreed to join her.\nIn 1491 DR, Ilva worked at the bar the Black Blade and Bloody Boar, in a lower part of the city."
