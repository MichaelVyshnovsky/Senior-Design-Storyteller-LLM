Juzla was a tainted one and independent spy of Skullport and Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Juzla was born and raised in Skullport. From a young age, she made a living as a freelance spy and sold secrets for coin.
However, she drew the ire of the yuan-ti slaver Zstulkk Ssarmn, who captured her, trained her as a sorcerer, and finally turned her into a tainted one. Zstulkk used Juzla as a spy to infiltrate the church of Cyric, but she converted truly to the worship of Cyric and for some time worked as a double agent. When her master learned of her duplicity, she managed to escape to the surface.
Circa 1372 DR, Juzla worked as a minor spy lord on behalf of a number of Waterdhavian merchants and guilds.
