        "mainbody": "'''Oin'Chakalop''' was an [[illithid]], member of a group of aberrations who ran the notorious Black Market, hidden in the mountains to the east from [[Samargol]] in the jungle nation of [[Samarach]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "In appearance, Oin'Chakalop was a standard mind flayer. The creature's behavior, however, was quite strange. Oin'Chakalop constantly twitched and made odd garbled noises that did not appear to be a language but rather insane mutterings and groans of an aberrant creature.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Oin'Chakalop was a highly respected seer and a prophet among his kin until one of his psychic travels took the mind flayer too far. Oin'Chakalop found himself touching the mind of a mad god. Many speculated that the mad god was [[Cyric]] himself. The contact shattered Oin'Chakalop's aberrant mind, leaving him incapable of speech. His fellow illithid [[Zhiir]] took the ex-seer under his wing to work as a servant in the Black Market of Samarach."
