'''Thaeven the Bald''' was the stablemaster for [[Fort Beluarian]] in [[Chult]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Abilities==
Thaeven was exceptionally gifted at taking care of animals, specifically [[horse]]s. His job at the fort was made much more difficult as horses were not accustomed to the tropical climate of Chult.

==Personality==
Despite his immense talent for his line of work, Thaeven incessantly complained about the difficulties he faced.
