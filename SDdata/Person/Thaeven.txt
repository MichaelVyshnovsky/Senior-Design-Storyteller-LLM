Thaeven the Bald was the stablemaster for Fort Beluarian in Chult as of the late 15 century DR.
Thaeven was exceptionally gifted at taking care of animals, specifically horses. His job at the fort was made much more difficult as horses were not accustomed to the tropical climate of Chult.
Despite his immense talent for his line of work, Thaeven incessantly complained about the difficulties he faced.
