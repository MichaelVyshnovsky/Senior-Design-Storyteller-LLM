        "mainbody": "Aiken Wyvernspur was a member of the noble house of Wyvernspur in Cormyr in the 11 century DR.\nAiken was short and slender, with dark brown eyes and hair.\nHe was a quiet man, and loyal to friends, family, and the Crown.\nAiken was a wise investor and developer in real estate. He ensured the familys financial stability by building houses and shops in Suzail.\nAiken was the son of Gerrin Wyvernspur I and Maritha of Mistledale. Aiken had an older sister, Sarah and a younger sister, Linnese. Aiken married Cinda Sweetwater and they had two children, Gould and Leah. Finder Wyvernspur was Aikens uncle.\nAiken and his friends, Lareth Huntsilver, Aubleth Crownsilver, and Gardrath Roaringhorn, discovered a mysterious magical instrument that folks named the Harp of Healing. They were walking home from a roadside inn north of Suzail and saw some commoners being drawn to the music of a floating, glowing, harp. After touching the instrument, each person seemed healed of any aches, sickness, or deformity, and then they departed, joyously, into the forest. When the four men grabbed the the harp in order to take it to a War Wizard for examination, the instrument fell dark and silent and would not display any activity while they were within a few steps of it. Divination and detection spells cast on the harp and the men did not reveal any more information about the harp, and thereafter it only seemed to temporarily relieve pain when touched, not restore full health as it appeared to do when the four companions first came upon it."
