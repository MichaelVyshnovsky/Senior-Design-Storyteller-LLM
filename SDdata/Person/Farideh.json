        "Description": "Farideh was tall and thin and had one golden and one silver eye.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|200}}",
        "Relationships": "Farideh had a love–hate relationship with her master Lorcan. She wanted to get out of the pact that she never really wanted in the first place but was unwilling to take the necessary steps. She had at least one occasion to kill Lorcan, which would have ended the pact but she chose not to. She loved her sister and adopted father although she frequently argued with both.",
        "Possessions": "The [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Laeral Silverhand]], once gifted Farideh with two personalized items: the ''[[sickle of shorn bonds]]'' and the ''[[seal of forbidding]]''. During her time adventuring in the service of the Open Lord, Farideh was armed with several powerful [[enchanted]] weapons, such as a ''[[rod of the pact keeper]]'', the ''[[fiendish moon]]'', an ''[[infernal cane]]'', and the ''[[fiendish brand]]''. She also possessed potent magic items such as ''[[dragon cult cubes]]'', a ''[[belt of the witch]]'', a ''[[devil's clasp]]'', an ''[[amulet of illusions]]'', the ''[[wreath of flame]]'', and a pair of unique boots made by her sister called the ''[[Foundation of Flame]]''. Farideh also carried several [[grimoire]]s, including a [[Book of Shadows (pact boon)|Book of Shadows]] which her patron used to enumerate the costs of some of her powers, specifically [[necromantic]] ones.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Havilar was attempting to summon an [[imp]] when she accidentally summoned a cambion named Lorcan. But he was more interested in making Farideh a warlock rather than her sister because Havilar had more of a warrior's personality.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|344}} Unbeknownst to Farideh, she was descended from [[Bryseis Kakistos]], one of the [[Toril thirteen]], the original thirteen tiefling warlocks who made pacts with [[Asmodeus]]. Lorcan was a collector of warlocks and Farideh completed his set of descendants of all thirteen.\n\nThe summoning resulted in a fire that burned down the family's barn and attracted the attention of the village. When the villagers learned what had happened, they exiled Farideh, Havilar, and Mehen.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|13-30}} Thereafter, the three were forced to work as bounty hunters to scratch out a living. While on the road, Lorcan would occasionally show up and teach Farideh a new spell and give advice, but Mehen was so hostile to the cambion that Lorcan began appearing to Farideh only when she was by herself.\n\n[[File:Farideh's_Fireball.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A stylized depiction of Farideh conjuring a ''[[fireball]]''.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, the trio was on the [[Sword Coast]] in hot pursuit of [[Constancia Crownsilver]], a knight of [[Torm]], who was wanted by the temple of Torm in [[Cormyr]] for dereliction of duty. They chanced upon a caravan under attack by [[orc]]s and helped defend the caravan.{{Cite digital book/Brimstone Angels/Kindle|713}} The twins befriended [[Aubrin Crownsilver|Brin]], a young runaway [[cleric|acolyte]] of Torm, who was on the run from the priestess that was the trio's quarry. Brin convinced Mehen and the twins to travel with him to [[Neverwinter]], where he would present himself to the Tormites in the hope that they would get word to the priestess that he was in Neverwinter. The trio hoped to capture the priestess if she showed up.\n\nWhile in Neverwinter, Mehen and the twins became entangled in a plot by the [[archdevil]] [[Glasya]] to trick Asmodeus into entering into hostilities with the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. They rescued Mehen from [[Rohini]], one of Glasya's [[succubus]] agents who later became [[plaguechanged]] and joined forces with the Sovereignty, and caused enough trouble that Glasya abandoned her plan.\n\nLater in 1478 DR, Mehan, Farideh, and Havilar returned their bounty Constancia to [[Suzail]] through the [[Waterdeep portal]]. Due to a lack of funds, only Mehen and Constancia were able to make the journey through the portal while Farideh and Havilar remained behind in Waterdeep.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|688}} With nothing better to do, Farideh tagged along with [[Tam Zawad]], who was investigating a magical page from an ancient [[Netheril|Netherese]] book. Farideh was invited to a party at the mansion of the caravan master [[Adolican Rhand]], who purchased the page and she and Tam's [[Harper]] partner [[Dahl Peredur|Dahl]] stole the page.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|2536}}\n\nTam's daughter [[Mira Zawad|Mira]] was able to locate the origin of the page, the lost [[Library of Tarchamus]], and Farideh, Havilar, Tam, Brin, Dahl, Mira, and two [[Zhentarim|Zhents]] journeyed to the library where they recovered the magical tome, the ''[[Book of Tarchamus]]'', from which the page was ripped. In the process, they destroyed [[Tarchamus the Unyielding]]'s [[mummy]] and his library by Farideh casting ''[[Tarchamus' volcano]]''.\n\nAfter a deal with Lorcan's sister [[Sairché]], which resulted in them being held in magical stasis on [[Malbolge]] for seven and a half years, Farideh and Havilar were sent back to Toril in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}. To keep her part of the deal, Farideh had to go to one of six Netherese internment camps that were run by Adolican Rhand. The camp Farideh went to was located in the [[Lost Peaks]]. With a newly gained ability, Farideh had to single out the captured [[Chosen]] from the common prisoners. This ability was part of the new powers Asmodeus had given to her as one of his Chosen. Although Netheril's plan was to gather the divine sparks of the Chosen and transfer them to [[Shar]], Asmodeus's plan, as a matter of course, was to capture the sparks for himself. Unfortunately for him, [[Glasya]] and [[Levistus]] tried to hamper this aim. [[Magros]], the agent of Levistus, allied himself with [[Thay]] in order to transfer the sparks to [[Szass Tam]]. During her confinement, Farideh also met, but didn't recognize, the [[ghost]] of Bryseis Kakistos. Finally, Farideh, Dahl (who had traveled with Farideh by accident), Lorcan, and some of the captives managed to rescue the prisoners with the help of the timely arrival of Havilar, Brin, Mehen, and other Harpers before the camp was destroyed by Thayan forces."
