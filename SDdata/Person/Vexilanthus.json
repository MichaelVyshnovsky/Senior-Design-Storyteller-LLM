While conversing with him the adventurers mentioned that they were on the lookout for giants. Vexilanthus informed the group that recently some hill giant had been prowling around a decrepit old tower, somewhere in the hills After pointing the adventurers in the direction of the tower, Vexilanthus offered to escort them to the nearest settlement for a fee of 500 or more gold pieces."
