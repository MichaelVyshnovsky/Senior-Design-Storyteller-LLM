        "mainbody": "Ruelrond Honadarr was the Master Shipwright and builder of Honadarrs Unsinkable Hulks from the city of Hlath in the Vilhon Reach, active in the late 15 century DR.\nRuelrond was a famed shipbuilder among sailors for creating large wide-hulled vessels, resistant to capsizing. Honadarrs Unsinkable Hulks were treated with fire-resistant substances and were virtually impossible to sink. Ruelrond Honadarrs critics claimed that the Hulks \"sailed sideways\" and had \"all the grace of a bloated dead ox carcass.\""
