        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Axerock came into conflict with two [[drow]] who stole his four gemstones and threw him into a pit. Adventurers may have chanced upon him; if they agreed to release him, he'd have turned ''[[invisible]]'' and fled, stalking them and waiting for the lot to come across these drow and inevitably fight. If they did, he'd attack whoever won that fight; he wouldn't slay the adventurers if they were taken down by the drow, however."
