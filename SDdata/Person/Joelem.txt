'''Joelem''' was a young man of [[Thunderstone]] who was kidnapped along with [[Kenhart]], [[Troyappa]], and [[Jonren]] to work as a slave in the [[fire giant]] [[Oghalis]]' smelting operation in the [[Hullack Forest]]. He and the rest were kidnapped by a [[satyr]] who was forced to kidnap else have his own family killed.

Fortunately, not that long after disappearing from the town, concerned [[adventurer]]s raided the operation, freeing the young men along with many enslaved [[centaur]]s and satyrs.
