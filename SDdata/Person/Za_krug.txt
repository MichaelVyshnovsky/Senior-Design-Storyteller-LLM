'''Za'krug''' was the boss of a pack of [[goblinoid]]s in the [[Western Heartlands]].

{{Quote|Scouts - get to the high ground. Raiders - charge the bastards!|Za'krug.}}

==Description==
The large [[goblin]] was far stronger and more robust than typical goblins. He wore a set of chain [[armor]] over thicker plating that skulls were attached to. He led not only other goblins, but also [[bugbear]]s and [[worg]]s. Za'krug fought with either a [[greataxe]] or a serrated curved [[sword]]. The goblin leader had grey hair. He also wore a [[copper]] [[ring]].

==History==
In the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], Za'krug and his minions followed a group of humanoids towards the [[Emerald Grove]]. The goblins began to assault the compound, and shot dead the gate commander, [[Kanon]].
