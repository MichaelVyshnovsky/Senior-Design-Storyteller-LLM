        "mainbody": "etrello was a misguided halfling bard who was infatuated with the wild elf chieftain Kyleena Moonglow circa 1372 DR.\nPetrello wore his reddish-brown hair in a ponytail and dressed in smart, fanciful clothes. He always tried to inflate his importance and exaggerate his talents.\nPetrello was armed with an enchanted +1 double-bladed sword.\nPetrello came across Kyleena Moonglows tribe after she guided them to the Lonely Barrens outside of Daggerford and attempted to claim the land as her own. The hin musician relentlessly pursued the wild elfs affection and convinced himself he was Kyleena Moonglows \"court composer.\" In reality, Kyleena found the halfling entertaining and almost annoying, allowing him to stay with the tribe as long as he amused her tribe with his poor musical skills. Despite Petrellos incessant practice, Kyleena did not consider him her \"court composer\" nor a member of the tribe. The bard claimed to have composed entire operas dedicated to his Queen. However, none of the operas were completed nor put on paper.\nIn 1372 DR, a piece of music sheet landed on the halflings head when he was on his morning stroll. The paper was The Song of Breaking that was recently lost while being transported along the Trade Way. Petrello tried to sway Kyleena using the new piece of music unsuccessfully. Subsequently, the Hero of Daggerford came knocking in search for the unique magical music sheet on the behest of Vladmyr, a collector from Daggerford. Petrello greedily attempted to leverage a high price for the item, but his negotiating skills were just as lacking as his musical skills were. The hero claimed the scroll, paying measly 100 gold coins, while Petrello claimed he memorized the songs by heart. However, Petrello quickly realized that he did not remember a note. Following Kyleena Moonglows departure from the Lonely Barrens, Petrellos whereabouts were unknown."
