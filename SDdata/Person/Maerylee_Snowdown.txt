'''Maerylee Snowdown''' was a [[spectral harpist]] in [[Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Maerylee, in life, was a [[half-elf]] [[bard]] who settled in Myth Drannor after the raising of the ''[[mythal]]'' and joined the original [[Harpers|Harpers at Twilight]].

She died at one point, but thanks to the mythal somehow rose again as a strange kind of [[undead]] [[ghost]].

From then on, Maerylee helped all good-oriented adventurers, especially fellow Harpers or bards, who ventured inside the city by directing them with the sound of her harp.

In the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], a Harper was captured by a [[doomsphere]], so Maerylee used her harp to call an adventuring party to free the captive Harper.
  
==Activities==
As in life, Maerylee always sung at sunset. She couldn't touch material objects so she used her harping to help the adventurers.
