        "mainbody": "'''Catlindra Serpentar''' was an adventuress in [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "History": "Catlindra was born in [[Impiltur]] to a pair of merchant and lived her teenage years traveling on and around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Always bullied by local children, she grew strong to respond to the offenses. When finally her parents were very wealthy, they retired to a villa in [[Selgaunt]], [[Sembia]], and Catlindra was a fierce fighter who had killed many thieves.\n\nThere, however, her mother was killed and replaced by a [[doppelganger]] but Catlindra saw the deception and slew the monster in front of her father. Her father remained totally shocked and descended into a catatonic state. To do something more than care for him, Catlindra decided to finance a female-only adventuring party, the [[Company of the Catlash]].\n\nTheir first task was to eliminate a wizard near [[Haptooth]] who commanded [[undead]]. From him, she won the ''[[catlash]]'' for which the group was named. In time, Catlindra and her fellows became famous in the [[Vilhon Reach]] area.\n\nIn 1370 DR, the Company decided to go to Myth Drannor in order to acquire some magic items to empower them.",
        "Activities": "Catlindra directed the [[Company of the Catlash]].",
        "Personality": "Catlindra prided herself on being a capable leader, always maintaining a group that was strong and united. She dreamed of fighting for the liberty of the [[Dalelands]] and reclaiming or building a stronghold there, where she could talk with kings and rulers. Another dream was to be recruited by the [[Harpers]], whom she respected very much. Catlindra was always polite but cautious with strangers. She was an able judge of character and always uncovered deception."
