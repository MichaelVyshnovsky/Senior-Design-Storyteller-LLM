Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the druid Halsaime, which turned him into a red musk zombie and began spreading to the other patients. Aeron was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie as well before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was able to be used by head priest Jaskyr Hurim to create an inoculation, allowing Peron Uthe to be safely destroyed."
