Peron was infected with a strange disease passed from the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]], which turned him into a [[red musk zombie]] and began spreading to the other patients. Aeron was among those infected, and eventually transformed into a zombie as well before being destroyed when the hospital was cleansed. A sample from his body was able to be used by head priest [[Jaskyr Hurim]] to create an inoculation, allowing Peron Uthe to be safely destroyed."
