'''Corinye''' was one of two [[medusa]]e guarding the lair of the [[dracolich]] [[Azurphax]].

==Description==
Corinye dressed in a cowled cloak under which she hid her face from those she did not wish to [[Petrification|petrify]].

==Relationships==
Corinye lived in Azurphax's cave with her sister [[Kathala]].

==Possessions==
Like her sister, Corinye wore a [[Magic items|magic]] [[chain shirt]] underneath her cloak for defense and was armed with a [[halfspear]]. She carried [[rope]] and a [[grappling hook]] and [[potion]]s infused with the [[spell]]s ''[[fly]]'' and ''[[cure moderate wounds]]''. Her [[shortbow]] was crafted masterfully.

==Abilities==
Corinye was a well-trained fighter, who focused on ranged attacks with her bow. With her magic potions, she often rained arrows down on foes from the air.

==History==
Whenever adventurers entered their patron's lair, the two medusae would assist the former [[green dragon]], who was immune, as a dracolich, to their petrifying gazes.
