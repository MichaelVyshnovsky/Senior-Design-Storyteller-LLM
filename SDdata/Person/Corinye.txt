Corinye was one of two medusae guarding the lair of the dracolich Azurphax.
Corinye dressed in a cowled cloak under which she hid her face from those she did not wish to petrify.
Corinye lived in Azurphaxs cave with her sister Kathala.
Like her sister, Corinye wore a magic chain shirt underneath her cloak for defense and was armed with a halfspear. She carried rope and a grappling hook and potions infused with the spells fly and cure moderate wounds. Her shortbow was crafted masterfully.
Corinye was a well-trained fighter, who focused on ranged attacks with her bow. With her magic potions, she often rained arrows down on foes from the air.
Whenever adventurers entered their patrons lair, the two medusae would assist the former green dragon, who was immune, as a dracolich, to their petrifying gazes.
