'''Colombier''' was a powerful [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] and [[alchemist]] who taught at the [[Alchemical Seminary]] in [[Eileanar]], [[Netheril]], shortly before its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Activities==
Colombier was an expert alchemist with a focus on [[magical powder]]s, and taught this skill at the Seminary under the supervision of [[Quintus]]. Alongside [[Delacroix]], she was considered one of the more practical and relatable teachers there, as everyone could appreciate the applications of useful [[potion]]s and powders.
