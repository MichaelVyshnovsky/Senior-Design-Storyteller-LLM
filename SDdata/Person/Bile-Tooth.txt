==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of [[Baldur's Gate]], striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden and one of its lairs in the caverns of the Trollbark Forest. Bile-Tooth commanded the goblin raiders to attack [[Randalla Brasshorn]]'s caravan that moved from [[Waterdeep]] to the Gate, capturing and dragging several caravaners, including Randalla, to the cavern depth, where the goblin leader and his beloved [[giant spider]]s guarded looted goods. Subsequently, a group of six heroes slew Bile-Tooth, his giant riding spider, and the marauders within the lair.
