'''Dharva Scatterheart''' was the would-be-queen of [[Greenfields]] in [[1372 DR]]. She enjoyed the open space, freedom from taxation, and the caravans that regularly pass through. Allied with the [[Shadow Thieves]], Dharva had established a small town called [[Greenest]] on the trail that led to [[Berdusk]]. She was not particularly happy to be in business with the likes of them, but tolerated it nonetheless.
