Dharva Scatterheart was the would-be-queen of Greenfields in 1372 DR. She enjoyed the open space, freedom from taxation, and the caravans that regularly pass through. Allied with the Shadow Thieves, Dharva had established a small town called Greenest on the trail that led to Berdusk. She was not particularly happy to be in business with the likes of them, but tolerated it nonetheless.
