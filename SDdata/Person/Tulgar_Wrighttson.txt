Tulgar Wrighttson was the ruler of Orlumbor circa 1358 DR.
Tulgar had long grey-black hair and a beard. He dressed in purple attire and a brown leather vest.
In 1358 DR, several war vessels from Waterdeep had surrounded Tulgars island state. He, of course, grew very concerned, but the Heroes of Ascore managed to discover the real problem, and reported it to the ruler. The apparent naval confrontation was actually headed by Luskar pirates flying the flag of Waterdeep, who wished to sow discord within the Lords Alliance.
Later that year, Ougo of Farr Windward accompanied the Heroes of Ascore on their continuing mission. Farr Windward was a small village of banished "crazy" people, each of which had been evicted from their original communities, and were branded. Due to this brand, Ougo and the others were unable to leave. Ougo, with the help of the heroes, managed to escape Farr Windward, and hatched a plan to brand Wrighttson. After getting an appointment with Tulgar, Ougo struck the brand into him. The leader of Orlumbor himself would have been banished, due to the brand, so he directed his soldiers to remove the guards of Farr Windward. From then on, Farr Windward became a free town of Orlumbor, and the brands held no longer held meaning.
