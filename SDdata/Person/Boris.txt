Boris was a sea pirate captain in the late 15 century DR.
Boris was a rough sailor and a tough critic.
Boriss pirate crew raised Calliope, and she considered the captain to have been her best mentor. As a grown adventurer, she carried a sentient rapier that had Boriss face and voice, and was thus of course also named Boris.
