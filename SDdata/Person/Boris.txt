'''Boris''' was a sea pirate captain in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Boris was a rough sailor and a tough critic.

==Relationships==
Boris's pirate crew raised [[Calliope]], and she considered the captain to have been her best mentor. As a grown [[adventurer]], she carried a [[Sentient item|sentient]] [[rapier]] that had Boris's face and voice, and was thus of course also named ''[[Boris (rapier)|Boris]]''.
