Usually, people of nearby villages consulted him about their most troubling problems in exchange for gifts. Near his house lived a dragonne, Chalocka. Uxma allowed it to stay in the area to discourage visitors.\nUxma was a benevolent individual, especially liking artists. However, he was very terse with people he considered fools. He enjoyed his image as a powerful and mysterious sorcerer."
