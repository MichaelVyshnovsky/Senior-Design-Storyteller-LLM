'''Saestra Karanok''' was the [[vampire]] daughter of the ruler of [[Luthcheq]] in [[Chessenta]] in [[1357 DR]].
  
==History==
During a very cruel joke by her brother, [[Naeros Karanok]], she was locked in a crypt for nine days. When Saestra exited she was a vampire. However, she managed to keep this fact secret from her family and directed them in destroying her vampire master.

Saestra managed to keep her secret by supervising the city watch at night, explaining this as a system to improve the watch's efficiency. Using the watch's cover, she killed people she framed as wizards, secretly draining them of blood.

Eventually, Saestra's true nature was discovered by her father and she escaped from Luthcheq. After some travel, she relocated to [[Erlkazar]], where she became the hidden queen of that kingdom. First Saestra united all the bandits in the area in a efficient army and later she seduced and transformed the country's king.

In [[1600 DR]], Saestra was still in operation when she and [[Sanwar Beguine]] attacked [[Jadaren Hold]] near [[Erlkazar]].
 
==Activities==
In the day, Saestra delivered baskets of food, healing [[herb]]s, and small toys for the children of Luthcheq. At night, Saestra used confiscated magic tools to incriminate a person as a wizard and during a private interrogation drained the victim's blood.

==Personality==
Saestra had two personalities depending of her hunger: in one she was sweet, innocent, and loving; in the other she was a savage killer.
