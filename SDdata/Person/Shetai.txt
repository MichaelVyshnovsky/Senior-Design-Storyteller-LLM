Shetai, the Vulgar Inquisitor, was a high-ranking paeliryon that was a fiend patron for warlocks in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
In the , Shetai, still an erinyes in the service of Malagard, was summoned by Bryseis Kakistos and forged a warlock pact with her.
Shetai was responsible for the fall of the Hag Countess and afterward gained much power. By 1353 DR, Shetai had become a paeliryon and explained to Bryseis that Asmodeus himself was interested in renewing her pact.
In the 14 century, it was collecting warlocks and double-crossed Lorcan. In the , Shetai had some trouble and so asked Lorcan for help, using his sister Neferis as a messenger.
Shetai had some dealings with Lorcan. The Vulgar Inquisitor was the patron of a warlock heir of the Toril thirteen called Lachs the Yellow. Shetai commanded some of its fellow erinyes.
