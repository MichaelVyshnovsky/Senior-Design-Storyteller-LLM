Emmalou was a Neverwintan soldier stationed in Leilon in the late 15 century DR.
Circa 1491 DR, Emmalou and another soldier were assigned to protect a group of settlers from Leilon who were traveling to the Wayside Inn for supplies. Little did they know that the Cult of Talos had taken over the inn and were attempting to turn it into a shrine of Talos, summoning a violent thunderstorm in the process. Rain, strong gusts, and huge hailstones slowed movement to a crawl as the caravan drew within a mile of the inn. When one of the horses was killed by lightning, they were forced to turn back. The weather calmed down once they had retreated just a few hundred yards down the High Road. Emmalou stayed behind and kept an eye on the situation while the rest of the group returned to Leilon.
Emmalou observed that the thunderstorm slowly but steadily expanded. To stay outside the stormy area, Emmalou had to backtrack several hundred yards. She was nearly struck by lightning several times, but her prayers to Talos saved her. While retreating from the thunderstorm, Emmalou was attacked by three air elemental myrmidons that had been conjured into suits of plate armor forged by the blacksmith Teega. At that moment, a group of adventurers appeared and helped her fight the elementals. After that, the adventurers were able to stop the ritual in time.
