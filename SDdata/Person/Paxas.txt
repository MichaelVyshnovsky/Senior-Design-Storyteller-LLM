Paxas was a member of the Dukars of Myth Nantar in Ser√¥s in 1370 DR.
Paxas was a standoffish and focused individual. Once set, nothing could break his concentration, a skill useful for study but not for battle. However, he could divine information from the most obscure clues.
Paxas became one of the first new Dukars of the Order of Kupavi.
In 1370 DR, Paxas decided to take a break from his studies. With his companions Dinam and KaioaTara, he guided ships attacked by Myth Nantars mythal away from the city and toward the Shipwreck Plains. In one of the ships they discovered surface dwellers.
