'''Paxas''' was a member of the [[Dukar]]s of [[Myth Nantar]] in [[Serôs]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Personality==
Paxas was a standoffish and focused individual. Once set, nothing could break his concentration, a skill useful for study but not for battle. However, he could divine information from the most obscure clues.

==History==
Paxas became one of the first new Dukars of the [[Order of Kupavi]].

In 1370 DR, Paxas decided to take a break from his studies. With his companions [[Dinam]] and [[Ka'ioa'Tara]], he guided ships attacked by Myth Nantar's ''[[mythal]]'' away from the city and toward the [[Shipwreck Plains]]. In one of the ships they discovered surface dwellers.
