'''Jamie''' was the son of [[Elizabeth Clawthorn]], an inhabitant of the town of [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
When [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] met with the elderly Elizabeth in [[1367 DR]], she mistook him for Jamie. Though Jasper did not know who or where Jamie was, he played the role somewhat for her benefit. Liz recalled Jamie was a good son, and as a boy he swung on a rope hanging from a tree his father later had to cut down.
