'''Algernon''' was a wealthy paunchy man who became a target for [[Pheirkas]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] ne'er-do-well in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Algernon was staying in one of the most expensive rooms of [[Feldepost's Inn]] in the town of [[Beregost]]. The man traveled with his [[enchanted]] ''[[Algernon's cloak|cloak]]'', the item that caught Pheirkas's eye. She sought a competent [[thief]] to acquit the magic item without shedding Algernon's blood, offering [[gold]] and payment.
