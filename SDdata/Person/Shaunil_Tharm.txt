Shaunil Tharm () was a mage of skill who lived with her husband Rhauntides in his tower in Highmoon. 
Shaunil was impish, tall, and lithe. Her hair was so long it swept the ground behind her. 
The soft-spoken Shaunil liked to spend her time traveling the skies of Deepingdale at night with her lord and a bottle of elverquisst enjoying the beauty of the lands below.
