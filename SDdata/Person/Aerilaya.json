She eventually grew tired of life on the island, and around 1367 DR she considered returning to Faerûn.\nShe maintained a close relationship with Carreigh Macumail.\nAerilaya usually wore green druidic robes but in battle she would wear hide armor. She carried a staff of swarming insects, a +1 scimitar, a sling, and an elfrune."
