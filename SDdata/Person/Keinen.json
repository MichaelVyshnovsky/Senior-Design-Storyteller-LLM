        "mainbody": "Keinen was a paladin in the service of Waterdeeps temple of Torm.\nKeinen was an elderly man with long locks of white hair, sporting a significant beard that nearly reached his waist. Underneath his armor he wore a lengthy, green gambeson.\nAlthough his goal was to become the leader of Torms Waterdhavian priesthood, Keinen knew deep inside that a quiet clerical life was not for him. His true passion was the art of combat, and he therefore chose to compromise by becoming a paladin.\nKeinen wore a suit of banded mail. In combat he rode a brown warhorse with chain barding, and wielded a lance and shield."
