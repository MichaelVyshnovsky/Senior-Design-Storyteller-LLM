        "mainbody": "Umbralax was a shadow dracolich that dwelled within the Darklands of the Plane of Shadow.\nWhen the Faer√ªnian village of Hespheira was transported to the Plane of Shadow in the , members of the Brotherhood of Light travelled the planes in pursuit. Umbralax encountered the holy warriors in its domain, and slew many of their numbers before they escaped with Hespheiras villagers.\nUmbralax bided its time for over a century, before traveling to the Prime Material plane with an army of wraiths. The dracolich waited in the returned ruins of Hespheira, drawing the Lathanderite champions known as the Order of the Aster into a fight that came to be known as the Battle of Hespheira. While Umbralax was defeated and his army scattered, his phylactery remained and the portal to his home on the Plane of Shadow remained open for some time."
