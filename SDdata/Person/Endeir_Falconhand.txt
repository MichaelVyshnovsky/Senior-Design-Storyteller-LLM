Endeir Falconhand was a skilled huntsman in the service of the Rayburton family in the years surrounding the formation of Cormyr. He was an ancestor of Florin Falconhand, a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor.
Endeir was seldom seen wearing anything other than dark green tunic and breeches, high leather boots, and leather gauntlets on his tall, broad-shouldered frame. He wore his family crest, a white falcon with talons splayed for attack, on a powder-blue sash draped from shoulder to opposite hip. He had steely gray eyes and, in later years, hair that matched.
Endeir was a taciturn man that kept his mouth shut and his eyes open.
He was an expert marksman with a longbow and an excellent hunter.
Endeir was usually able to anticipate his masters needs in regards to scouting the Wolf Woods, defense of the Rayburton holdings, and storing provisions for winter. He had a dozen skilled huntsmen under his command to help him accomplish whatever tasks were asked of him.
Endeir was a Rayburton family retainer even before they arrived in the wilderness that eventually became Cormyr.
One of the pivotal events surrounding the Rayburton Jewels was an outbreak of fighting between Belmer and the Cormyrean warlords Relve Turcassan and Orndar Merendil that left each of the three leaders wounded and with a few fatalities on both sides. According to well-known explorer and educator Volothamp Geddarm, it was this incident that resulted in Endeir Falconhand leaving the service of Belmer. Volo speculated that Belmer either suspected or believed that Endeir had given the two warlords cause to think the Rayburtons were wealthier than they appeared to be, which prompted them to press Belmer for more financial support for the defense of the realm.
