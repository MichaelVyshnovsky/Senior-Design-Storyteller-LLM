Lord '''Harkuldragon''' was a nobleman of [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Personality==
Perhaps due to bigotry, he believed himself far more capable in hand-to-hand combat than he actually was.

==Abilities==
He was easily bested in hand-to-hand combat.

==Activities==
Lord Harkuldragon had been planning some treason in the days leading up to his death.

==Possessions==
He had a [[dagger]].

==Relationships==
While listening to King [[Foril Obarskyr I]]'s speech during the [[Council of the Dragon]], Lord Harkuldragon wore an expression of open contempt, suggesting he was not content with the state of nobility.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|87|9}}

Lord Harkuldragon had long hired [[Sarrak]] of [[Westgate]] as his mage.

==History==
Lord Harkuldragon was one of the guests to the Council of the Dragon in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}.

Later, while discussing with his mage about how to kill [[Khaladan Mallowfaer]] for having learned something about his plans for treason, Lord Harkuldragon was interrupted by [[Cymmarra]]. As he did not follow her commands, Cymmarra slew him, first attempting magic, which didn't work, and then breaking his neck, which did. This event was observed by [[Imglor Ironhand]], a hired killer and spy, and through him, by [[Manshoon]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Days prior to his death, Harkuldragon mentioned, at the [[Three Ravens]], that he had "something else" if the usual magics failed. This led the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] Manshoon to wonder if perhaps he wielded a [[blueflame item]], leading to his eavesdropping.
