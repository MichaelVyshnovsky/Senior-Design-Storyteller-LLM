I am among those who has seen our 'god' eat and drink like a human...He has lied to us from the beginning.|Leety, speaking about [[Bane]] during the [[Time of Troubles]].}}",
        "History": "When the [[Faerûnian pantheon|gods of Faerûn]] came to [[Toril]] as [[avatar]]s during the Time of Troubles in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Leetym was in a unique position to witness some of the actions and secrets of the temporarily-mortal deity Bane. He was witness to the fact that Bane's avatar was not truly the imposing and mighty form that was displayed for all too see, but still mortal with the same weaknesses as men.\n\nDuring the [[Second battle of Shadowdale]] that same year, Leetym was assigned to fight directly alongside Commander [[Ronglath Knightsbridge]]. He seemed to be at least vaguely aware that Bane was readily sending his own zealous followers to their death on purpose."
