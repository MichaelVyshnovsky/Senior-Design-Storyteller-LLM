He managed to pose as the Head of Security of an entire ward.\nHatchet was a cruel-faced man. He dressed in regal attire, had a balding forehead, and a large black beard.\nIn 1358 DR, the Heroes of Ascore visited Amelior Amanitas in Secomber, and he handed them a letter of vital importance to give to Piergeiron the Paladinson. The heroes were tasked with escorting ambassadors of the Lords Alliance from Leilon to Waterdeep, and would present the letter on arrival. However, in the Rutting Buck tavern of Leilon, their rendezvous, the heroes were poisoned, and the letter was swapped with a forged one.\nUpon entry to Waterdeep, the heroes told the guards of their mission, and were escorted to the wards Head of Security, which was actually Fell Hatchet. He read the forged letter which exposed the carriers as being spies. Accordingly, the Kraken operative ordered the convinced guards to tie up the Heroes of Ascore and toss them into the sea. Chained up, and with heavy rocks attached, the heroes descended into the depths of the Trackless Sea. However, they were rescued by sirines, and lived to foil the plans of the Kraken Society, Zhentarim and Luskar spies."
