Glavel was a monk at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose.
Glavel was a monk in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose and a member of the Order of the Chisel in the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred. His duty was to act as a brewer and cook for both the monastery and the Guest House. Secretly, he was also a member of the Cult of Howling Hatred.
Glavel was one of the cultists who infiltrated the monastery in 1491 DR. When the adventurers arrived at the monastery, they confronted Glavel.
Glavel was the lover of Olara, a fellow cultist.
Glavel at heart was a selfish sociopath. He joined the Howling Hatred only because they encouraged his hobbies. Glavel was a very good liar and would quickly change sides if his life was in danger.
