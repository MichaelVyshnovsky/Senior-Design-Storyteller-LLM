Currag Blackstone was the son and heir to Earl Angus Blackstone on the Moonshae Isles. He died suddenly in mysterious circumstances in the .
Currag was summoned to the gate of his fathers manor on a rainy night when an old, grey-haired man approached an inner gate, having inexplicably overcome a  palisade. Currag initially reacted with hostility to the old man, setting the familys pack of moorhounds on him. The old man was able to stop the moorhounds with a spoken command, and send them fleeing with another. Currag then took a sword from one of the manors guards and stabbed the old man, who appeared to fall over and die. The next morning, Currags body was found lying on the stone paving displaying a terrified expression, apparently having fallen  to his death.
