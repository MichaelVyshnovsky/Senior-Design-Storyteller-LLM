In 1367 DR, she settled in Evermeet to discuss how drow could participate in the Retreat. Her presence on the isle was known only to the queen and the high mage Laeroth Runemaster. The queen knew that sun elf Houses would never accept drow on Evermeet.\nKarsellyn was a graceful individual and the perfect representative of how a good-oriented drow could be. She was impulsive, chaotic, intense, flirtatious, and somewhat fickle.\nSome said that Karsellyn was romantically interested in the human buccaneer Carreigh Macumail.\nCategoryClerics\nCategoryClerics of Eilistraee\nCategoryDrow\nCategoryAmbassadors\nCategoryWorshipers of Eilistraee\nCategoryInhabitants of Faer√ªn\nCategoryInhabitants of Evermeet\nCategoryInhabitants of the Trackless Sea\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nt5i23sc8h3sgcjuovitf7j0um4zyn8n"
