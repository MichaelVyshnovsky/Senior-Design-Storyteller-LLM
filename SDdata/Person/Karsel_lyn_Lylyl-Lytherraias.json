        "History": "Karsel'lyn had worked for years as an agent of Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] among drow. In 1367 DR, she settled in Evermeet to discuss how drow could participate in the [[Retreat]]. Her presence on the isle was known only to the queen and the high mage [[Laeroth Runemaster]]. The queen knew that [[sun elf]] Houses would never accept drow on Evermeet.",
        "Personality": "Karsel'lyn was a graceful individual and the perfect representative of how a good-oriented drow could be. She was impulsive, chaotic, intense, flirtatious, and somewhat fickle.",
        "Rumors": "Some said that Karsel'lyn was romantically interested in the [[human]] buccaneer [[Carreigh Macumail]].",
