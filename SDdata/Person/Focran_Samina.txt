Focran Samina was the owner of Ropes for All Uses within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Focran was a sleight man.
Most of the ropes Focran sold were actually purchased from rope-makers in the Clothiers District.
His speciality was making a unique rope that was extremely resist to escape attempts, making it perfect for use in bindings. Focran hand-crafted all of these ropes himself and only kept three for sale in the store at any given time.
