'''Maradad''' was an innkeep inhabiting the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had an intense expression, perhaps because she remained unmarried. She was polite but spoke under her breath when she disapproved of something.

==Activities==
Maradad owned the [[House of Comfort]] [[inn]] located near the center of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on the south bank of the [[River Tesh]]. She would slap the hand of anyone trying to get frisky with her young serving girls [[Anna (Zhentil Keep)|Anna]] and [[Lise]].
