Maradad was an innkeep inhabiting the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
She had an intense expression, perhaps because she remained unmarried. She was polite but spoke under her breath when she disapproved of something.
Maradad owned the House of Comfort inn located near the center of Zhentil Keeps Foreign Quarter on the south bank of the River Tesh. She would slap the hand of anyone trying to get frisky with her young serving girls Anna and Lise.
