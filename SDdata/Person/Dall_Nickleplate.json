        "mainbody": "'''Dall Nickleplate''' was the overseer of the ''[[Lantan-Samarach portal]]'' in the jungles of [[Samarlogh]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''[[Gond]]'s [[titanium]] [[tongs]], how did I know that woman would send someone to bother us one of these days? It was just a matter of time... I'll be over there, looking at the [[portal]] controls if you actually want to do something useful in the meantime, don't touch anything. The [[golem]]s' eyes may be fake, but they're on you, strangers.''|Dall Nickleplate}}",
        "Personality": "Dall was an irritable and nervous man, wary of outsiders. He tried his best to always rain in control.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Dall Nickleplate was put in charge of the illegal logging operations deep within the Samarlogh. Very few locals knew of the ''portal'' and the camp. One of the few such individuals was a merchant of [[Samargol]]â€“[[Sa'Sani]]. She made an agreement with Dall Nickleplate to keep the operations secret in exchange for her merchant company's use of the magic transportation device. Sa'Sani did pay fairly for the ''portal's'' use.\n\nHowever, that alliance was threatened when a [[yuan-ti]] spy named [[Luaire Farwander]], once an adviser to the [[Mercantile House]] and Sa'Sani, attempted to sabotage the ''portal'' when his treachery was unveiled. He sought to disrupt the trading company's operations and cut Sa'Sani from her allies on the [[Sword Coast]]. Luaire [[poison]]ed the portal operator with a specific toxin found in the nearby jungle. With the magic engineer gone and the mechanisms damaged, Dall Nickleplate and his crew became stranded in the jungles, unable to return to [[Lantan]] overnight. Dall begrudgingly allowed a group of Sa'Sani's [[mercenaries]] into the camp to aid with the poisoning investigation. Inadvertently, the group ended up aiding Dall with several operational troubles that plagued the ''Lantan-Samarach portal''. Overseer Nickleplate suspected the camp's massive logging mechanisms to be moved by hungry [[dinosaur]]s at night, so he tasked Sa'Sani's hirelings to hunt the creatures down while the sabotaged portal mechanism was being repaired. As proof, he collects dinosaur claws. Dall hoped to study the claws in order to create a some sort of device that would keep the dinosaur pests at bay."
