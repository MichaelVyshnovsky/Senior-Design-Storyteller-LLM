        "Personality": "While known to be shy around women, Tantuss was particularly bashful around priestesses of his own faith. He regularly bowed more often than necessary in order to hide his blushing cheeks.",
        "Relationships": "While also an active [[Harper]], Tantuss was known to tutor fellow [[ranger]]s for a nominal fee. He always donated what he did not need to live to the [[Church of Mielikki]]."
