        "mainbody": "Tantuss Shieldsun () was an adventurer and guide who operated in the North. \nTantuss was a notably tall man, his face framed with black hair and a bushy beard.\nWhile known to be shy around women, Tantuss was particularly bashful around priestesses of his own faith. He regularly bowed more often than necessary in order to hide his blushing cheeks.\nWhile also an active Harper, Tantuss was known to tutor fellow rangers for a nominal fee. He always donated what he did not need to live to the Church of Mielikki."
