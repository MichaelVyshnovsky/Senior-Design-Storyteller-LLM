Phthta Thak (pronounced "fith-ta thak") was a necromancer and inhabitant of the Battle of Bones.
Phthta was a loner and a recluse, wishing nothing more than to be left alone to her work. Numerous traps and undead guarded her underground lair, which was located in the western mountains of the region.
She wielded considerable necromantic magic as well as many protective and charming spells.
She was known to carry a ring of polymorph self, a ring of fire resistance, a wand of animate dead, a gem of true seeing, and boots of climbing. Her familiar was an undead cat named Bones.
Phthtas sole interest was in training her undead charges to work together so they could protect themselves from their natural enemies. She dealt mostly with ju-ju zombies.
