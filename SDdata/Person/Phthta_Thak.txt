'''Phthta Thak''' (pronounced "fith-ta thak") was a [[necromancer]] and inhabitant of the [[Battle of Bones]].

==Personality==
Phthta was a loner and a recluse, wishing nothing more than to be left alone to her work. Numerous traps and [[undead]] guarded her underground lair, which was located in the western mountains of the region.

==Abilities==
She wielded considerable necromantic magic as well as many protective and charming [[spell]]s.

==Possessions==
She was known to carry a ''[[ring of polymorph self]]'', a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'', a ''wand of [[animate dead]]'', a ''[[gem of true seeing]]'', and ''[[boots of climbing]]''. Her [[familiar]] was an undead [[cat]] named [[Bones]].

==Activities==
Phthta's sole interest was in training her undead charges to work together so they could protect themselves from their natural enemies. She dealt mostly with [[ju-ju zombie]]s.
