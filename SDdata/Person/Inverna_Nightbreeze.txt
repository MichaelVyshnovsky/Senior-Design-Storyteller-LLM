'''Inverna Nightbreeze''' was a [[moon elf]] [[warrior]] who lived in the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
She had a distinct scar on her cheek, given to her by an [[orc]]ish [[javelin]].

==Personality==
Inverna had the firm belief that all people possessed an inherent dignity with which they should be treated. She also believed that [[orc]]s were not people, and that all of [[Toril]] should be rid of their presence.

She was wary of just about everyone she met, and seldom spoke at great length. Despite her quiet nature, Inverna had a sharp and sarcastic wit.

Not one to admit being in the wrong, Inverna was quite stubborn at times.
