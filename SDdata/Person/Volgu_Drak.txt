'''Volgu Drak''' was a Fist of [[Bane]] who served the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Volgu was a [[human]] man with tan complexion and and curly silver hair. He wore a [[chainmail]] adorned with Bane's [[holy symbol]]s. He was armed with a large wooden [[shield]] and a [[mace]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of Bane]] joined forces with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], led by the [[Chosen]] of Bane, Lord [[Enver Gortash]]. Fist of Bane Volgu Drak was a part of the Cult's operations that targeted the countless refugees that flooded Baldur's Gate. His branch of the Cult assembled donations and toys rigged with [[blackpowder]] explosives in the [[Felogyr's Fireworks]] shop's third floor. Presumably, Volgu perished during or shortly before the Cult attacked Baldur's Gate.
