'''Irgul of Telflamm''' was an [[adventurer]] of some renown who met his demise ''circa'' [[1370 DR]] in the town of [[Jathrin's Jump]] in [[Turmish]].

==History==
A tomb complex underneath Jathrin's Jump, often used by smugglers, attracted the attention of fortune-seeking adventurers. Sometime shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Irgul and his band found a way into the tombs. As they reached the tomb's main chamber, Irgul was torn apart by a [[stone golem]]. His fellow adventurers survived the expedition.
