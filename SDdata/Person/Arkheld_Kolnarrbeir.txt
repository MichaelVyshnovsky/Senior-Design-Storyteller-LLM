Arkheld Kolnarrbeir was a shipwright from the city of Marsember in Cormyr, active in the 1490s DR.
By the late 15 century DR, old sarcastic Arkheld Kolnarrbeir assembled a multi-racial crew of veteran shipwrights who, under his leadership, gained a reputation of being the best quality for the money in the shipbuilding business. Their vessels were cheap, constructed quickly, and of relatively good quality. Arkhelds crew operated from the best crane-equipped non-magical drydock in the Sea of Fallen Stars.
