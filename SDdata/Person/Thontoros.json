Thontoros made a study of the clergy, relics, and deeds of the followers of the deities of justice: [[Helm]], [[Ilmater]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]]. <ref group=\"note\">The wording in ''Prayers from the Faithful'', \"of other followers\" suggests that Thontoros himself worshiped one of these four deities.\n\nThontoros once wrote about how the [[Twelve Champions of Torm]] defended the citadel of [[Lothtia]] on the [[Shining Plains]] against [[orc]]s in the [[1158 DR|Year of the Blood Tusk Charge, 1158]]. Thontoros mentioned that the [[paladin]] [[Harondath]] carried the holy shield the ''[[Veloghon of Vigilance]]'' in battle and \"bathed it in the blood of the orcs of [[Thoktor Ironfangs]].\"\n\nThontoros was the author of a book entitled ''[[Relics of the Righteous]]'', chronicling, amongst other things, the creation of the sword ''[[Dornavver]]''."
