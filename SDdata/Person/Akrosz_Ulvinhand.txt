Akrosz Ulvinhand was a human blacksmith who lived in the village of Amphail in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Akrosz was a very tall man and sported a beard.
Akrosz lived and worked in an establishment that was known as the Ulvinhand smithy. He only undertook commissions that interested him and local gossip claimed that many of these were blades later enchanted by wizards.
He was said to be the equal of any smith in Waterdeep, making him counted among the best human smiths in all of the Sword Coast.
