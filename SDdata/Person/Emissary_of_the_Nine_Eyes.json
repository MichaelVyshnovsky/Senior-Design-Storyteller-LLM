        "Description": "The Emissary appeared as a 'person' with markings upon their body that looked like eyes.",
        "History": "At some unknown time, the Emissary of the Nine Eyes appeared before the 'spiritual echoes' of four [[dragonborn]] elders of the [[Inquest]], as they remained trapped within the Astral Plane. The Emissary showed to them an unknown 'Viridan Planet' upon which the dragonborn of [[Abeir]] could resettle, and live free from the war of [[xorvintaal]].\n\nThis meeting inspired the Inquest to begin construction on the [[bridge of stars]], a world-spanning device that would never reach completion."
