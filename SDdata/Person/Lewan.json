        "mainbody": "Lewan was Beruns apprentice. An orphan from Murghom and a follower of Silvanus.\nLewans skin was weathered by exposure to the elements and darker than Alaodins but not as rich as Talieths. He was tall and lean, but also strong. Per Valmir, he resembled a Murghomi or Mulhorandi.\nLewan was originally the child of farmers from Murghom. He was saved by Berun and Chereth after raiders from the Ganathwood slew his family on . The raid put him in a position where he mercy-killed his mother, which traumatized him intensely.\nHe remained with Berun until the age of seventeen, while pursuing a tiger that had killed a shepherd. Lewan fell unconscious from multiple injuries, and was taken to Sentinelspire for treatment. He was treated as a guest of Lady Talieth there, even granted an opportunity to leave. Talieth sought his aid in unlocking the powers of Eraellen, an artifact that one of her hunters had taken from Berun, which the Old Man of the Mountain intended to use to destroy civilization throughout Faerûn. Lewan remained unswayed, until he bonded with the servant Ulaan.\nHowever, after numerous days of attempting, he suspected that having lain with Ulaan on the night of the Jalesh Rudra may have rendered him unclean in the eyes of Silvanus. Though he apologized to Ulaan for the implications, he requested Lady Talieth that he be allowed to try and purify himself outside the fortress, and that Ulaan be freed from service once he succeeded. While attempting a rite of purification, he was approached by the Old Man of the Mountain. That night, he had a dream that Sentinelspire exploded in a supervolcanic eruption, decimating civilization throughout Faerûn. Before he could try again to unlock the power of Eraellen, the fortress came under attack by Berun.\nLewan made an attempt to escape in the conmotion he got into a fight with several Blades of the Old Man. In the process, Ulaan revealed was one of the Blades of Lady Talieth Nonetheless, he was brought to the Tower of the Sun by the killoren serving the Old Man. There he learned that the Old Man of the Mountain he had spoken to while purifying himself was Chereth, Beruns master. Chereth was frustrated that neither Lewan nor Berun would abide by his plans to destroy the world using the power of the fortress and Eraellen, and almost killed Ulaan to punish Lewan for this."
