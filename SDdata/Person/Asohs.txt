Asohs the Daring was a halfling that worked as an administrator at Holyhands House in the North Ward of Waterdeep in the . He and his two brothers were known as the Defenders Three.
Asohs was quick to anger and had trouble dealing with the structure imposed by authority.
Before giving up his life of crime, he was an effective spy and an accomplished saboteur.
Asohs had a special sword that was made by Brian the Swordmaster. His brother Pithar commissioned three of these blades, two for himself and one that he gave to Asohs. They were the length of a short sword but designed to be wielded like a long swordâ€”able to land slicing blows and block larger weapons effectively.
Asohs ran away from home at a relatively young age and fell into doing dirty work for unscrupulous merchants and spying for traders that were not interested in abiding by the law. He was arrested a few times and his brothers bailed him out each time until he finally renounced that life. Before he quit for good, he gave tips to the authorities that revealed two smuggling operations in Dock Ward. He then joined Pithar and his other brother Amstor in taking service to Ultas Maernos of the noble Maernos family as bodyguards. That arrangement lasted at least two years before Ultas died and bequeathed his estate to become a temple for the demihumans of Waterdeep. By 1372 DR, the Defenders Three were running Holyhands House.
Asohs was the youngest of the three brothers. The Defenders Three were considered friends of the Harpers because, in their service to Lord Maernos, they delivered packages and messages to various Harper agents in Baldurs Gate, Luskan, and Mirabar. The trio hoped to be invited to become full-fledged Harpers.
