        "mainbody": "Tradrem Kethtrod was an earthsoul genasi and the Steward of the Earth of the Four Stewards of Akanûl in the late 15 century DR.\nTradrem was a barrel-chested, square-jawed genasi with brown skin and golden szuldar lines.\nTradrem was an ambitious individual, but also very patriotic. He had the well-being of Akanûl as one of his priorities. Coming from a minor noble family, Tradrem believed he had much to prove, and he always was thinking on how he could get political advantage of any situation.\nAs of 1479 DR, Tradrem was considering fostering a good relationship with Queen Arathane, in order to exchange favors with her in the future.\nAs the Steward of the Earth, Tradrem was the spymaster of Akanûl.\nTradrem was the first earthsoul who attained the position of Steward of the Earth, as before him that position was held exclusively by watersoul genasi. He was also the first earthsoul noble who aspired to a higher position rather than just being a high-ranking officer in the military forces."
