Odak Truesteel was a fat cleric of Dumathoin in the Starspire Mountains in Tethyr in 1370 DR.
In 1370 DR, following some clues, Odak and his companions Bapar Ghalmrin and Soram Battlebellow discovered that a group possessing one of the lost Scepters of Shanatar must be in the village of Toralth.
On the night of Uktar 10, they entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter and interrupting the ballad that a bard was singing for the lost companions of the Shields of the Highland adventuring company. Bapar accused some of the patrons of thieving from the dwarves and asked them to turn over to him the thieves and the stolen goods.
Bramas Thorntree then accused some of the other patrons of the theft of the Scepter, but Timor, Karr, and Vajal of the Shields of the Highland got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer mugs and swinging their chairs. Bapar was hit by Timors mug and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. The true thieves, the Company of the Anvil, tried to use this as an opportunity for Bramas to escape with the Scepter, but the dwarves eventually caught up with him and recovered it.
Odak was a cheerful dwarf, friendly with non-dwarves with a very sarcastic humor. His duty was to protect dwarven secrets from outsiders but also to protect Bapar. Odak believed that Shanatar fell because they shared their secrets with humans and others. He was suspicious of everyone.
