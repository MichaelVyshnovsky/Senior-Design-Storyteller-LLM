'''Odak Truesteel''' was a fat cleric of [[Dumathoin]] in the [[Starspire Mountains]] in [[Tethyr]] in [[1370 DR]].

==History==
In 1370 DR, following some clues, Odak and his companions [[Bapar Ghalmrin]] and [[Soram Battlebellow]] discovered that a group possessing one of the lost ''[[Scepters of Shanatar]]'' must be in the village of [[Toralth]].

On the night of [[Uktar 10]], they entered the tavern seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' and interrupting the ballad that [[Estelar Sunweaver|a bard]] was singing for the lost companions of the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company. Bapar accused some of the patrons of thieving from the [[dwarves]] and asked them to turn over to him the thieves and the stolen goods.

[[Bramas Thorntree]] then accused some of the other patrons of the theft of the ''Scepter'', but [[Timor]], [[Karr]], and [[Vajal]] of the Shields of the Highland got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer [[mug]]s and swinging their chairs. Bapar was hit by Timor's mug and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. The true thieves, the [[Company of the Anvil]], tried to use this as an opportunity for Bramas to escape with the ''Scepter'', but the dwarves eventually caught up with him and recovered it.

==Personality==
Odak was a cheerful dwarf, friendly with non-dwarves with a very sarcastic humor. His duty was to protect dwarven secrets from outsiders but also to protect Bapar. Odak believed that [[Shanatar]] fell because they shared their secrets with [[human]]s and others. He was suspicious of everyone.
