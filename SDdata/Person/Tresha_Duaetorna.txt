Tresha Duaetorna held the office of "officer of the holies" in Tulmon along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Tresha was rotund and motherly.
She encouraged the sultans policy of personal unassisted worship among Tulmons citizens, which helped many of the citys smaller shrines and chapels flourish.
Tresha was originally an adventurer from Waterdeep who worshiped Ao at one point in her life.
