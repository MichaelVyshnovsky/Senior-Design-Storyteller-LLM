'''Dreyon''' was a member of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==History==
In [[1491 DR]], possibly taking advantage of an eruption of elemental power, Dreyon and his cell of Black Earth cultists took control of [[Westbridge]]. However, some adventurers helped by [[Sedina Wolfpaw]] confronted and defeated him and his minions.
