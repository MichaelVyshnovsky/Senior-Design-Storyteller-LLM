        "mainbody": "Ashala was a female lizardfolk cleric of Semuanya and a member of the Sharptooth tribe in the Vast Swamp of Cormyr in the early 1370s DR. \nAshala was the mate of Kessessek.\nIn early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Ashala was among a group of Sharptooths captured by Shadowscales and held prisoner in the tower of the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp, along with chieftain Gathan, Gruss, Kurash, and Sithen. The ordeal left them weary and emaciated and Ashala without any spells. They were presumably rescued by adventurers in service to Mystra investigating Sharran activities there. She was greatly pleased to learn that Kessessek still lived and was declared chieftain of the tribe.\nAs a cleric of Semuanya, Ashala commanded the Plant and Water domains. She could rebuke plant creatures much more often than normal."
