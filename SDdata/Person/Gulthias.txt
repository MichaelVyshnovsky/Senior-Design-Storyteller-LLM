'''Gulthias''' was a [[vampire]] of another world and a follower of the [[great wyrm]] [[Ashardalon]].{{Cite dragon+/13/Fiction: Sunless Citadel}}{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|21}}

==Personality==
Gulthias was fanatical and insane. Even after his master's death he believed that the dragon could return in some way. This belief would later prove true. Over time, he stopped seeing any distinction between his faith and the [[necromancy]] he practiced.

==History==
After his master's consort was murdered in an event known as the Wrath of Ashardalon, which would later cause the great wyrm's supposed death at the hands of the [[druid]] Dydd, Gulthias and other followers decided to turn themselves into [[undead]] to await the return of the great wyrm whom they believed to be a living god.

However, in a remote citadel, adventurers pierced Gulthias's heart with a [[stake]]. From the stake mixed with the vampire's [[vampire blood|blood]] emerged a tree known as the [[Gulthias tree]].<ref><ref>

Somehow, Gulthias returned.

Most of the cultists led by the vampire went to populate a place known as the Nightfang Spire, a tower carved into the claw of some colossal creature. Surrounded by undead servants, [[girallon]]s, [[flesh golem]]s, and a [[mooncalf]] he protected the undead heart of Ashardalon.

==Rumors & Legends==
Although Gulthias had no known presence on [[Toril]], tales of him and the Gulthias tree reached as far as the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon+/13/Fiction: Sunless Citadel}}
