'''Rhazbos Redbridle''' ({{Pronounce|Ra|HAZZ|boe|zz|_|RED|bry|dul|refs=}}) was a stout and jolly ex-adventurer who operated a stable within [[Waterdeep]]. He was also a former mercenary and caravan leader. 

==Personality==
He was a noted member of the [[Stablemasters' & Farrier's Guild]] within the city. Though he was quite busy, Rhazbos took time off to tutor the occasional [[fighter]] who can afford his services.
