Rhazbos Redbridle () was a stout and jolly ex-adventurer who operated a stable within Waterdeep. He was also a former mercenary and caravan leader. 
He was a noted member of the Stablemasters & Farriers Guild within the city. Though he was quite busy, Rhazbos took time off to tutor the occasional fighter who can afford his services.
