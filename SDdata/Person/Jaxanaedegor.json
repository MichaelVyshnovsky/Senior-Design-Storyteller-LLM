        "mainbody": "Jaxanaedegor was an ancient green vampiric dragon who lived on Mount Thulbane in Threskel.\nJaxanaedegor was described as having scales of alternating light and dark green and yellow eyes. He was so big that he even towered over blue dragons.\nAround 1365 DR, Alasklerbanbastos sent Jaxanaedegor and some lesser dracoliches to devastate Mourktar where Regent Kabarrath Telthaug had ignored the will of the dragon-king. In 1479 DR, he was Alasklerbanbastoss lieutenant during Threskels war with Chessenta. He was also a taaldarax of Brimstones xorvintaal.\nIn one of the most important battles in the war, he switched sides and betrayed Alasklerbanbastos."
