        "mainbody": "'''Jaxanaedegor''' was an ancient [[Green dragon|green]] [[vampire|vampiric]] [[dragon]] who lived on [[Mount Thulbane]] in [[Threskel]].",
        "Appearance": "Jaxanaedegor was described as having scales of alternating light and dark green and yellow eyes. He was so big that he even towered over [[blue dragon]]s.",
        "History": "Around [[1365 DR]], [[Alasklerbanbastos]] sent Jaxanaedegor and some lesser [[dracolich]]es to devastate [[Mourktar]] where Regent [[Kabarrath Telthaug]] had ignored the will of the dragon-king. In [[1479 DR]], he was Alasklerbanbastos's lieutenant during Threskel's war with [[Chessenta]]. He was also a ''taaldarax'' of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]''.\n\nIn one of the most important battles in the war, he switched sides and betrayed Alasklerbanbastos."
