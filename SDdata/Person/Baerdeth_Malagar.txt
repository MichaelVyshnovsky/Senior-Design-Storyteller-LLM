'''Baerdeth Malagar''' was the High Priest or Huntmaster of the [[High House of the Hunt]], a temple devoted to the worship of [[Malar]] in [[Zhentil Keep]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
As Huntmaster, Baerdeth supervised 11 other priests of Malar. Their congregation in 1358 numbered just shy of a score of worshipers of the Beastlord.

Following the destruction of most of Zhentil Keep in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Baerdeth took control of the [[Leathercrafters' Guild]] in the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] and converted it to a new temple of Malar he called the [[Lodge of the Great Hunt]].
