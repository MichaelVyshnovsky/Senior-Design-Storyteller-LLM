Despite some reticence from Bysera, the pact was forged.\nVery little was known about Bryseis, other than that she was the leader of the Toril thirteen, the original thirteen tiefling warlocks who made pacts with Asmodeus. She was said by the cambion Lorcan to have been a thoroughly wicked person who was partially responsible for Asmodeuss ascension to godhood.\nOne of her tiefling descendants named Farideh became a warlock in 1477 DR when she made a pact with the cambion Lorcan. She also has descendants in Lachs the Yellow, a warlock pacted to Shetai the Paelyrion Nasmos, pacted to a bone devil named Incus and Adastreia Tyrianicus, pacted to a Logokron from the 8th layer named Kulaga."
