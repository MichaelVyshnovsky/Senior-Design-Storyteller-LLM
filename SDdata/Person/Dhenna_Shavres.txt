Dhenna Shavres was a Red Wizard and leader of the Rose Keep enclave in Aglarond.
She managed to keep running the enclave even after the War of the Zulkirs, when all Red Wizards outside Thay were recalled home by Szass Tam or faced exile. She also gained the trust of the neighboring Aglarondans.
In 1396 DR, she briefly met Raidon Kane and the ex–Red Wizard Seren Juramot.
