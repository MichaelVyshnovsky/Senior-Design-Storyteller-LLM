'''Morus Brokengulf II''' was a [[paladin]] of the [[Knights of Samular]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==History==
Morus II was, from the age of 16, a devoted paladin and Tyrran zealot, even cutting off his right hand in sacrifice to [[Tyr]] and soon joining the Knights of Samular.

After a long time hunting evil throughout the [[Sword Coast]], the death of Lord [[Morus Brokengulf I]] forced Morus II to become the next patriarch of the [[Brokengulf]] family. However, after some months of work, Morus II was greatly frustrated and turned over day-to-day operations of the family business to fellow Knight [[Gareth Cormaeril]], and again set out to fight evil.

Morus II sometimes returned to the city but spent most of his time fighting monsters and hunting [[Claugiyliamatar]], the old enemy of his family.
