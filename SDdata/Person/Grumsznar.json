        "mainbody": "rumsznar was a drow wizard of House Fey-Branche in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was encountered by an adventuring party, after they had been sent by Ssar Tarell to find a way to enter House DoUrden. Grumsznar told them he couldnt allow House DoUrden to acquire the three parts of the legendary Spider Helm, the final piece being a gem. Thus, he planned to use the companions as a distraction.\nHe gave the companions the house entry password, and sent them to meet with Rizzen DoUrden, who would provide them a map of House DoUrden. Furthermore, he suggested that in order to gain full entry to House DoUrden, they appear as part of a returning drow patrol. Therefore, with his illusion magic, he transformed each member of the party into a drow version of themselves."
