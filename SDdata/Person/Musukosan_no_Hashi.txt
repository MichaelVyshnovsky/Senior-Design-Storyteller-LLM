'''Musukosan no Hashi''' was one of the most powerful [[yakuza]] crime lords in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Hashi's gang operated in the Miyama capital of [[Tamanokuni]], especially in the Bridge District. He led around 300 yakuza. His main business was managing gambling houses and harassing local merchants and shippers. Hashi's main income came from the price that all must pay to dock in the port unless they wanted their ship destroyed.

==History==
Hashi arrived in the city in [[1354 DR]] and soon gathered around him the most violent yakuza. In 1357 DR, they came into conflict with [[Ebi]]'s gang. They frequently fought in the streets. The situation reached the point that only one of the two gangs could survive.
