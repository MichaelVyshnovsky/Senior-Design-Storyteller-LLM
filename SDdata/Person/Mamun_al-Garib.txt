Mamun al-Garib was the chief vizier for the sheikh of the House of Dhib in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.
Though he commanded genies and jann, Mamun would never dare question a ruling from Sheikh Anwat al-Makkar, whom he admired and feared.
In addition to advising his sheikh, Mamun was a skilled shair in his own right.
Mamun was actually the grandson of the sheikhs first vizier.
