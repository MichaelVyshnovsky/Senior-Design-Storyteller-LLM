'''Therzt''', known simply as the '''Chosen of Ghaunadaur''', was a male [[drow]] priest and the self-proclaimed [[Chosen]] of [[Ghaunadaur]] in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
He was apparently responsible for the transformation of [[Neverwinter]]'s polluted [[Blacklake]] into a magical sludge. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, following the [[siege of Neverwinter]], Therzt summoned sludge-covered [[zombie]]s from out of Blacklake to attack the waterfront of the [[Blacklake District]], making a wrecked ship his base. The alchemist [[Hazel (individual)|Hazel]] led the defense while Piniwin and Penny sought aid from adventurers; aided by her [[alchemist's fire]], they defeated Therzt and the undead.

In [[1486 DR]], Therzt somehow reappeared as a captive of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], in [[Doomvault]]. When freed by adventurers working for the [[Thayan Resurrection]], he began babbling that he needed to die for his weakness and cast an ''[[acid arrow]]'' spell on himself, dying as he proclaimed his devotion to Ghaunadaur.
