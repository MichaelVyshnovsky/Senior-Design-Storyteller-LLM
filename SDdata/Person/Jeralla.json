        "mainbody": "Jeralla was a dragonborn sorcerer of red dragon ancestry who was a bandit leader in the Moonsea in 1489 DR.\nJeralla believed herself to be a Chosen of Tiamat but this was a false claim. She intended to gather treasures to fund the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.\nIn Thar, Jeralla gathered an army of kobold followers of Tiamat and formed the Claws of Tiamat bandit group. Jeralla led the Claws into the Moonsea to raid caravans.\nShe drew the attention of many others. The Cult of the Dragon sent a spy, Sharrak, to infiltrate the group, which they considered heretical. The Gray Patriots bandit group offered an alliance. Some merchants hired an adventuring party to clear the Iron Route of all the outlaws. Jeralla agreed to meet the Gray Patriots, but the meeting place was attacked both by the adventurers and a cultist war band. In the fighting, Jeralla was killed."
