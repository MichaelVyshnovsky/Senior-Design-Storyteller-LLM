Alvund was a merchant from the city of Ormpetarr in Sespech in the 14th century DR.
Alvund partnered with six other merchants—Chond of Calaunt, Dzunn of Sheirtalar, Jhasso of Baldurs Gate, Nammna of Milvarune, Pomphur of Almraiven, and Shield of Everlund—to form the Seven Suns Trading Coster. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Alvunds own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the coster.
Alvund and the Seven Suns were in business by 1358 DR, and still going by 1374 DR.
