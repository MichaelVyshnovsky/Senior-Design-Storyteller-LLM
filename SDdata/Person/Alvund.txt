'''Alvund''' was a merchant from the city of [[Ormpetarr]] in [[Sespech]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

Alvund partnered with six other merchants—[[Chond]] of [[Calaunt]], [[Dzunn]] of [[Sheirtalar]], [[Jhasso]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Nammna]] of [[Milvarune]], [[Pomphur]] of [[Almraiven]], and [[Shield (merchant)|Shield]] of [[Everlund]]—to form the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]]. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Alvund's own small merchant company was converted into a regional base for the [[coster]].

Alvund and the Seven Suns were in business by [[1358 DR]], and still going by [[1374 DR]].
