'''Uldinus Lawkland''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1278}} to {{yearlink|1280}}. He had earned the ire of [[the Simbul]] before becoming the Magister, which led to his short career.

==Appearance==
Uldinus was obese to the point that he employed magical aid to move around. He customarily had black, sharp-cut sideburns and a small goatee; he kept a catlike, small smile in his lips. His eyelids drooped somewhat.

==Personality==
He was described as gluttonous, and as a "greasy worm of a man" by the sage [[Maether]] of [[Ordulin]].

==Abilities==
Uldinus knew spells that laid an ''[[antimagic field]]'' on an object; some of them were devised by him, and some were devised by the previous Magister, Thornar Fleetmoor. He also knew a methods to allow multiple rings to work together in the same person, with some records from [[Maether]] suggesting he wore up to four [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s in a single finger.

==Possessions==
Uldinus had devised enchanted, small levitation metal balls, which he used to help carry himself around floating. Those devices consumed [[rubies]] or [[sapphire]]s to function. He was known to have festooned his fingers with rings.

==History==
Uldinus Lawkland had been a fellow student of [[Faerdinalar]] the Enchanter together with the previous Magister, [[Thornar Fleetmoor]]. In {{yearlink|1277}}, before becoming the [[Magister]], Uldinus stole a copy of the ''[[Simbul's spell trigger]]'' spell from its creator, drawing her ire; however, she was forbidden from destroying him by the time she noticed, for he had become the Magister afted dropping a parapet, sheathed in an ''[[antimagic field]]'', on Thornar Fleetmoor; he was said to have destroyed the antimagic field spells afterwards, to make sure they could not be used against him. The Simbul, so thwarted, instead trained a challenger during his tenure, [[Ohland Grethgar]].

Uldinus' end came when he was ambushed by Ohland Grethgar in {{yearlink|1280}}, while following rumors of a number of [[Netherese]] sorceresses in ''[[temporal stasis]]'' within a crypt, who were surrounded by items only they knew how to operate. It was a short duel, for Uldinus had come to depend overmuch on his items and had lost practice with his spells.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|67-68}}
