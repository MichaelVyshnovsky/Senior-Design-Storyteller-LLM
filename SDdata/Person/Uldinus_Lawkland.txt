Uldinus Lawkland was the Magister from  to . He had earned the ire of the Simbul before becoming the Magister, which led to his short career.
Uldinus was obese to the point that he employed magical aid to move around. He customarily had black, sharp-cut sideburns and a small goatee he kept a catlike, small smile in his lips. His eyelids drooped somewhat.
He was described as gluttonous, and as a "greasy worm of a man" by the sage Maether of Ordulin.
Uldinus knew spells that laid an antimagic field on an object some of them were devised by him, and some were devised by the previous Magister, Thornar Fleetmoor. He also knew a methods to allow multiple rings to work together in the same person, with some records from Maether suggesting he wore up to four enchanted rings in a single finger.
Uldinus had devised enchanted, small levitation metal balls, which he used to help carry himself around floating. Those devices consumed rubies or sapphires to function. He was known to have festooned his fingers with rings.
Uldinus Lawkland had been a fellow student of Faerdinalar the Enchanter together with the previous Magister, Thornar Fleetmoor. In , before becoming the Magister, Uldinus stole a copy of the Simbuls spell trigger spell from its creator, drawing her ire however, she was forbidden from destroying him by the time she noticed, for he had become the Magister afted dropping a parapet, sheathed in an antimagic field, on Thornar Fleetmoor he was said to have destroyed the antimagic field spells afterwards, to make sure they could not be used against him. The Simbul, so thwarted, instead trained a challenger during his tenure, Ohland Grethgar.
Uldinus end came when he was ambushed by Ohland Grethgar in , while following rumors of a number of Netherese sorceresses in temporal stasis within a crypt, who were surrounded by items only they knew how to operate. It was a short duel, for Uldinus had come to depend overmuch on his items and had lost practice with his spells.
