        "mainbody": "Elak Dornen was a shopkeeper in Red Larch and the informal leader of the Believers during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nHe was a stern and inflexible man, and he enjoyed the power he gained from bending others to his side. Elak dreamed of a day when he and the other Believers could openly take power\nElak ran a shop. More importantly, he was a longstanding member of the Believers, often decisive in questions about how to direct the villages businesses and who was worthy to join the group.\nIn 1491 DR, Elak was the first to be seduced by the whispers of Larrakh of the Cult of Black Earth. Later, fellow Believers Ilmeth Waelvur, Marlandro Gaelkur, and Albaeri Mellikho killed some people in order to protect the secret of the Believers. When some adventurers uncovered them, the Believers were ruined and Elak most likely left the town."
