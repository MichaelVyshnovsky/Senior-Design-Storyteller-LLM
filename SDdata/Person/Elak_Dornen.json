        "mainbody": "'''Elak Dornen''' was a shopkeeper in [[Red Larch]] and the informal leader of the [[Believers]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.",
        "Personality": "He was a stern and inflexible man, and he enjoyed the power he gained from bending others to his side. Elak dreamed of a day when he and the other Believers could openly take power",
        "Activities": "Elak ran a shop. More importantly, he was a longstanding member of the Believers, often decisive in questions about how to direct the village's businesses and who was worthy to join the group.",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], Elak was the first to be seduced by the whispers of [[Larrakh]] of the [[Cult of Black Earth]]. Later, fellow Believers [[Ilmeth Waelvur]], [[Marlandro Gaelkur]], and [[Albaeri Mellikho]] killed some people in order to protect the secret of the Believers. When some adventurers uncovered them, the Believers were ruined and Elak most likely left the town."
