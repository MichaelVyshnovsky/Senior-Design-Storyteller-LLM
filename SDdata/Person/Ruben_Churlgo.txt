'''Ruben Churlgo''' was one of many members of the [[halfling]] Churlgo clan who produced the infamous [[Churlgo Cheese]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Ruben was a friendly and cheerful middle-aged halfling who often flashed his cheesy smile to the farm's guests.

==History==
One of the oldest members of the Churlgo family, he prefers to work with his hands, leaving all the business decisions to [[Millie Churlgo]].

Ruben, along with the rest of his family, moved their farm from the [[Dalelands]] to [[Daggerford]] following a nasty extortion business with the [[Iron Throne]]. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably not lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.
