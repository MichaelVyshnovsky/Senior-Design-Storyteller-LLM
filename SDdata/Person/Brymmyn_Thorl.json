All of them, he shrouded in a network of magical traps that polymorphed or destroyed outright any intruder.\nHe spent much of his time creating \"safeholds\" and building them into the operation of gates he found, thus allowing him to reach spaces that differed from those that other users of the same portals reached.\nBrymmyn Thorl won against the previous Magister, Tsanbrin Aulmeroevler, on the latters second duel in office. Afterwards, he spent much time building safeholds into portals. At some point in , the challenger Corthas Muhleer infiltrated his tower and transformed himself into Brymmyns bed, and thus was inside his wards when he came to visit for a final time while moving out the last of his magical possessions. Corthas gave him a restless, fitful sleep before he woke the Magister and challenged him to a duel. Brymmyn lost when he was shattered while transformed into a gargoyle.\nRumors continued after the destruction of his tower that there was magic left unclaimed."
