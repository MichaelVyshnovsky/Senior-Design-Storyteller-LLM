Nonakaniumi was a half-elf wizard, well-versed in Kara-Turan magical disciplines.
Garbed in light blue, Nonakaniumi had tan skin and shoulder-length blonde hair. He had full lips, pointed ears, and a turned-up nose.
In addition to being an accomplished wizard, Nonakaniumi was also unusually dexterous, making him difficult to hit in combat.
Nonakaniumi owned a medallion of ESP, a ring of elemental command (attuned to water), a staff of curing, and a wand of wonder.
Possessed of a natural affinity for water, Nonakaniumi was given his name (meaning "in the ocean" in the Kozakuran language) by a fellow wizard from Kozakura. Nonakaniumi spent much of his time studying the Eastern magical arts, and was an avid swimmer in his free time.
