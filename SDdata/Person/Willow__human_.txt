{{quote|Watch for wind direction. Put on your gloves. Aaaaaand... alight at arm's length!|Willow reciting safety rules to [[Avery Sonshal]]}}

==Description==
Willow was a [[human]] child with long white dreadlocked hair, hazel eyes, and chestnut skin. She wore a commoner's [[tunic]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Willow frequented Felogyr's Fireworks, being lured in by the seductive smell of [[smokepowder]]. When she had pocket [[coin]], Willow purchased fireworks to launch outside with fellow kids. Felogyr's Fireworks's proprietor, Avery Sonshal, sold the child the fireworks, but not before making sure she remembered the safety rules and after reciting Felogyr's Fireworks's legal disclaimer of not accepting any "liability for singed nails, toasted eyelashes, loss of limbs, scalded torsos, or blown off heads."
