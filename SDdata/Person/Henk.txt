Tender Henk was the proprietor and the barkeep of The Singing Lute in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Tender Henk was a gruff and unfriendly half-orcish man with a shaggy mop of black hair. He offered sub-par service to the taverns guests.
In the , Tender Henk ran The Singing Lute, a tiny waterside tavern that overlooked the Counting House and the citys Gray Harbor. Honk, a fellow half-orc who had a similar appearance and attitude to Henks, was known to tend to The Singing Lute when Henk was indisposed. Their similarities implied a blood relation. Honk insisted that Henk played his lute in the kitchen during the off hours.
During the same period of time, Henk posted an ad, searching to hire a drummer for the Lutes pickup band.
