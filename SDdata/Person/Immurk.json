        "mainbody": "'''Immurk the Invincible''' was the legendary first great pirate lord of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], who lived during the 12th century DR. He captained a ship called the ''[[Sea-Scorpion]]''.",
        "Activities": "As he began his piratical career, he recruited the disaffected sailors of various nations around the Inner Sea, promising them plunder for their loyalty. \n\nAlthough he and his pirates plagued much of the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars, also known as the Inner Sea, he had a number of positive contributions to the people of that region. Immurk and his pirates were the first ships to transport [[gold]] and [[silver]] from the nations of [[Unther]], [[Mulhorand]] and [[Chessenta]] to the [[Cormyr|Forest Country]], opening trade lines between [[Interior Faerûn|central]] [[Faerûn]] and [[East Faerûn|the east]].",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "An unintended legacy of Immurk the Invincible's death was the power vacuum it created among the pirates of the Inner Sea. The [[Pirate Wars]] were a series inter-pirate naval battles and voracious raids on the region's coastal nations."
