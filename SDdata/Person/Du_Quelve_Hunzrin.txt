'''Du'Quelve Hunzrin''' was a priestess of [[House Hunzrin]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Du'Quelve was often ordered by Matron [[Arolina Hunzrin]] to lead trade expeditions outside [[Menzoberranzan]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1313}}, during one of these missions, the Hunzrin met two priestesses, [[Yiccardaria|Iccara]] and [[Bolifaena|Bolfae]], who said they'd come from the previously unknown [[Arach Enclave]]. Matron Arolina ordered Du'Quelve to secretly transport the two priestesses to her. However, a mission headed by [[Beniago]] and [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]] was following them. Iccara promised to Du'Quelve a load of [[arandur]] and the service of a [[deep gnome]] slave, [[Symvyn Rivenstone]]. However, Zaknafein, [[Jarlaxle]], and [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] suddenly arrived and in the fighting Iccara was revealed to be a [[yochlol]]. In the end, Zaknafein destroyed Iccara, injured Du'Quelve and freed Symvyn.

In later years, Du'Quelve's career stagnated despite her claim to having been in league with two yochlols, as all knew she had only been tricked by the handmaidens.
