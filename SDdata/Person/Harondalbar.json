        "mainbody": "'''Harondalbar''' was a [[black dragon|black]] [[wyrm]] who had a lair in the mountains near the [[Yellow Snake Pass]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "The dragon had a cooperative relationship with the [[Zhentarim]] and was particularly enamored with the [[Zhent]] agent, [[Faren Starlight]], who served as Harondalbar's appointed \"keeper\". Faren showered him with adulation and regularly brought the black dragon people to feast upon and creatures to hunt for sport. In return, Harondalbar kept the Yellow Snake Pass free from non-Zhent activity and drove away any rival caravans or military patrols. However, the black wyrm often acted aloof, wanting nothing more than to simply lounge in his lair. When Harondalbar was in such a mood, Faren would have to rely on [[illusion|illusory]] [[magic]] to simulate the dragon's presence within the pass.\n\nIn addition to the Zhentarim, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] demonstrated significant interest in the black wyrm. They often brought offerings to his lair, along with assurances he could gain more power with their association."
