        "mainbody": "Erik Sliphand, also known as the Rogue of Turmish, was an ancient decorated hero of Myth Drannor who died before the advent of the Weeping War.\nEriks most notable possession was his unique enchanted leather armor called the armor of shadows, which served him in life and was buried with its owner in death.\nErik Sliphand, who lived in ancient Myth Drannor after leaving Turmish, died many centuries before his grave was disturbed by the Cult of the Dragon and their drow allies in 1369 DR. Eriks body was laid to rest within one of the decorated crypts of elven heroes of the City of Song, alongside Magister Luther, Arianna, Sindar, Bannoc, and Shyla. Their final resting places were corrupted by the wild magics of the Weeping War. The Rogue of Turmish and his crypt-mates became cursed with the undead existence as wraiths, forever guarding the artifacts they were interred with."
