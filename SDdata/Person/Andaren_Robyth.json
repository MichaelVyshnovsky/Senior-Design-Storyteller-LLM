At the time, it was common for impulsive young Halruaan mages to fly skyships overhead at night and drop in on ropes to try to raid their mansion. Andaren used one such spell-battle as a cover to scale the wall and enter the house. Amidst lightning bolts, fiery blasts, conjured jaws, and transforming spells, he got away with a sackful of magical items from the sisters, including Yornars Trail Companion, a holy Mielikkian spellbook. But he did not escape unscathed caught on the edge of a polymorphing spell, he was left with a reptilian left arm.\nThis made him an outcast, at least in so-called polite society, and was forced to live on the outskirts of settlements. But he found a new trade a killer for hire. Certain persons would pay him to enter a city under cover of night and murder certain other persons. This he did for a year or so.\nHowever, in the , a man hed attempted to murder did not actually die and hired the mage Hoth of the Six Curses to get revenge. Hoth found Andaren dwelling in a cave outside Phannaskul in Murghôm and intended to kill him, but Andaren bargained for his life by giving Hoth the Companion. Hoth settled for teleporting Andaren all the way to Westgate on the Dragon Coast. There, Andaren had an eventful, but short, career.\nAfter the partial polymorphing, Andarens left arm was scaled and had talons."
