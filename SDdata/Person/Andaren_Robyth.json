        "mainbody": "'''Andaren Robyth''' was a thief turned assassin from [[Phelzol]] in [[Semphar]] in the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1244}}, Andaren infiltrated the estate of [[Halatha Starnar|Halatha]] and [[Murbreistra Starnar]], sisters and renegade sorceresses from [[Halruaa]]. At the time, it was common for impulsive young Halruaan mages to fly [[Halruaan skyship|skyships]] overhead at night and drop in on [[rope]]s to try to raid their mansion. Andaren used one such [[spell]]-battle as a cover to scale the wall and enter the house. Amidst lightning bolts, fiery blasts, conjured jaws, and transforming spells, he got away with a sackful of [[magical item]]s from the sisters, including ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]]. But he did not escape unscathed: caught on the edge of a [[polymorph]]ing spell, he was left with a reptilian left arm.\n\nThis made him an outcast, at least in so-called polite society, and was forced to live on the outskirts of settlements. But he found a new trade: a killer for hire. Certain persons would pay him to enter a city under cover of night and murder certain other persons. This he did for a year or so.\n\nHowever, in the {{YearlinkName|1246}}, a man he'd attempted to murder did not actually die and hired the [[mage]] [[Hoth|Hoth of the Six Curses]] to get revenge. Hoth found Andaren dwelling in a cave outside [[Phannaskul]] in [[Murghôm]] and intended to kill him, but Andaren bargained for his life by giving Hoth the ''Companion''. Hoth settled for [[teleport]]ing Andaren all the way to [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]]. There, Andaren had an eventful, but short, career.",
        "Description": "After the partial polymorphing, Andaren's left arm was scaled and had talons."
