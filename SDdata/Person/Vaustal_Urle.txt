Vaustal Urle was a female human cleric of Helm who resided in Hillsfar and would occasionally help adventurers.
As a highly experienced cleric of Helm, Vaustal could request some of the most powerful divine spells from her deity. 
Vaustal Urle was occasionally known to lend help to adventurers in need of her aid. However, this help was generally only given out to followers of deities similarly aligned to Helm.
In 1372 DR, Vaustal Urle resided in Hillsfar, where she would aid adventurers who also worshiped deities of law, like Helm.
