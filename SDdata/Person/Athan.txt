Athans father, Garth, was not a good man. In his youth he seduced a desperate elven lass Jesenalae Stormlake, only to get her pregnant and abandon her. The half-elf child was Ghleanna Stormlake who was raised by her cruel elven family after Jesenalae died in childbirth. Years later, Garth made a confession on his deathbed about the elven paramour he abandoned and about Athans half-sister. Athan managed to find his family and took her away from the unloving home. Eventually, Athans circle of friends introduced the young half-elf to Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale and Ghleanna Stormlake became his apprentice.
In 1369 DR, once inactive pool of radiance reappeared in the caves under Phlan starting drain the life force of the citys residents. Elminster Aumar, aware of similar pools across the Moonsea swiftly assembled the volunteers to stop whatever was causing it. He places a group of hero to guard the pool in Phlan, and sent another, with the hero Athan in charge to investigate the Cult of the Dragon activities in the ruins of Myth Drannor. Elminster entrusted Athan with the legendary Gauntlets of Moander that stopped the corruption of the pool in Phlan a decade earlier.
Soon after his expedition arrived to the ruins of Myth Drannor, the Cult forces ambushed the group, led by the dracolich Pelendralaar himself, decimating the heroes. Faeril and Beriand were the only survivors of the massacre as the woman dragged the blind cleric out of the harms way. Athan was dragged away by the Cults dragonkin, defeated, broken, stripped of the Gauntlets of Moander and abandoned in the Cults prisons in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor. Eventually he was rescued and joined the second group of Elminsters adventurers, later known as the Veiled Ones, who initially were the guardians of the pool, but followed Athans group through the portal. Together they defeated the cult leader Kya Mordrayn and destroyed Pelendralaar. They aided Anorrweyn Evensong in restoring the mythal over the city, and drained the accursed corrupted pools of radiance returning the Moonsea region to relative peace.
