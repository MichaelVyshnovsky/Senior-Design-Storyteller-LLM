'''Lasfelro the Silent''' was a merchant on the [[Sword Coast]] just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==Personality==
Lasfelro usually remained silent, hence his moniker, but sometimes he broke into merry song or short bouts of joke-telling. He was a reasonably good singer and his jokes were quite funny.

==History==
At the start of the Tyranny of Dragons <span>inÂ </span>[[1489 DR]] Lasfelro attached his wagon to a great caravan that, unknown to him, was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]].
