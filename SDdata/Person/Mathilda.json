        "mainbody": "'''Mathilda''' was the experienced healer wife of [[Damien Morienus]] who grew apart from him and eventually fell in love with the [[Reghedmen]] prince [[Kinnuki]] ''circa'' [[1269 DR]]",
        "History": "Mathilda was married to the former master of the North Tower of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]]. Together they relocated to [[Icewind Dale]] for Damien to pursue his necromantic research away from spies and distraction. Together they lived in the [[Accursed Tower]] and slowly grew apart as the evil necromancer obsessed with eternal life was not the same man as the one she married. Damien Morienus was using the sick and dying folk of the barbarian tribe that resided in the area around the tower and the tribe's prince eventually fell in love with Mathilda, and she shared his feelings. Together they ran away from the Accursed Tower and lived with the tribe as Mathilda healed the barbarians with her healing abilities and kindness. Kinnuki and Mathilda had a child together, [[Jukini]].\n\nDamien Morienus' pride was hurt when he discovered his wife - his possession to be taken away from him. The summoned demons from lower planes to hunt them down and exact revenge on them. Eventually, the summoned creatures caused the event that came to be known as the [[Great Thaw]] ''circa'' 1269 DR. Almost all of the tribe, along with Mathilda, perished when the ice cracked under their feet. Jukini survived the arctic waters but died a few days later of bad fever."
