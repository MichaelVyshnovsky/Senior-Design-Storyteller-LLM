Finally, the Royal Constabulary discovered him and tried to arrest him. Urthag fled across the rooftops of Chessagol, but was forced to drop Galathos. Urthag escaped and his sword was given to King Lamoth.\nLegend had it that Urthag the Knife buried his treasure on the island of Two Rocks in the harbor of Harrowdale Town in the Dalelands. However, not a trace of this hoard was found by the mid–14th century DR.\nCategoryInhabitants\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of the Sea of Fallen Stars\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryPirates\nprzmjj44wpw379x1lvdliapngs4xcx4"
