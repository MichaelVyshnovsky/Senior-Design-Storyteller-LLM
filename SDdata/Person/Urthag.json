        "History": "Urthag somehow got his hands on [[Galathos]], a magic sword forged during the ancient empire of [[Raumathar]] and lost many centuries before.\n\nHe spent some time in the city of [[Chessagol]] in [[the Vast]], and boldly caroused for several hours at the [[Bloated Gargoyle Inn]]. Finally, the [[Royal Constabulary]] discovered him and tried to arrest him. Urthag fled across the rooftops of Chessagol, but was forced to drop Galathos. Urthag escaped and his sword was given to King [[Lamoth]].\n\nLegend had it that Urthag the Knife buried his treasure on the island of [[Two Rocks]] in the harbor of [[New Velar|Harrowdale Town]] in the [[Dalelands]]. However, not a trace of this hoard was found by the mid–14th century [[DR]].",
