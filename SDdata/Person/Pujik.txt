Pujik was an ormyrr chieftain who resided in the ruined city of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.
Pujik had a hide of distinctly darker hue than his fellow ormyrr.
Pujik was armed with an enchanted +3 longspear and an enchanted +2 small shield of dwarven make. Additionally, the ormyrr chieftain was gifted with an enchanted axe that was the talisman connected to the pool of radiance, enthralling him into the Cult of the Dragons service.
In 1369 DR, Pujik and his small tribe made a home in the swamps of the Sullymarsh in the ruins of Myth Drannor. After the Cult of the Dragons occupation of the city and corruption of its mythal and the pool of radiance, the agents of the cult approached Pujik with a gift of an enchanted axe. Ormyrrs, unable to resist magical gift, accepted. The axe served as a connection to the pool of radiances corruption. Soon after, one of the spawn pools erupted within the tribes territory. The chieftain started hearing mind-altering whispers from the pool, slowly going mad and eventually falling under the enthrallment of Kya Mordrayn and her corrupted pool. She used Pujiks influence on the tribe to guard the area against any intruders.
Not all ormyrr went along with the chieftain in serving the magical pool. Three members of the tribe (including Flem and Samaj) deserted and hid further north. During their investigation of the Cult, the Veiled Ones came across the tribe. Chief Pujik promised them a hefty reward for killing the "evil" ormyrr to the north. The heroes confronted the slug-like creatures, who turned out to be peaceful. The Veiled Ones returned to the Chief, only to get attacked by the whole tribe as per Kya Mordrayns orders. When Pujik expired, the link between him and the spawn pool was severed, and the body of magical water retreated to the main body of water, removing part of the corruption from the Sullymarsh.
