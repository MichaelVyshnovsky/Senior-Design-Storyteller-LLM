Autumnal Baskin was a professional meditator and a bare-knuckle champion.
Autumnal Baskin formerly possessed gloves of soul catching and a mask of soul perception.
Autumnal Baskins path to enlightenment unfolded through two distinct methods. The first involved abandoning her solitary habits as she preferred to spend time at caves and remote mountaintops. She stepped into a more social sphere and expanded her wardrobe with an array of lavender garments. The second entailed honing her martial skills. In some cases, breaking a few noses was essential to secure the best possible results on her way to cosmic harmony.
