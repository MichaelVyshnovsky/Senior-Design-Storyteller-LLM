Bufort Iggles, nicknamed The Unfortunate, was an unlucky instructor who lived sometimes in or before the late 15 century DR.
Bufort infamously set themselves on fire while explaining how to work oil of combustion. The oil was first to be applied to a weapon or other surface, and then ignited. Unfortunately, Bufort Iggles was lit aflame along with the oil in full view of the instructees.
