        "mainbody": "'''Basalin''' was a large man, said to be a [[werebear]], who wielded the [[enchanted|magic]] [[sword]] called ''[[Albruin]]'' some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Basalin used ''Albruin'' some years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He used the enchanted blade to protect his village from a variety of [[giant spider]]s, some of which were truly fantastical animals. These creatures menaced Basalin's home, controlled by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] whose true motivations remained unrevealed. ''Albruin'' protected Basalin from spiders' [[poison|venom]] and allowed him to detect and slay Red Wizards who wore ''dweomers'' of ''[[invisibility]]''."
