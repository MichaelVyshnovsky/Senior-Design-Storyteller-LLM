 was a merchant and a member of the consortium for crime known as the Tarntar. His specialty was quality leather clothing and furs. He was present in the common room of the Whistling Wizard inn in Voonlar when the conflict that was later dubbed the Battle at the Bar broke out. He had no known magical ability and was likely hiding behind or near the bar when the enchantments already placed on it mixed catastrophically with the spells being hurled at it, causing the bar to explode violently enough to take out part of the ceiling. He and at least one business partner, Alro "Five Flames" Randulkyn, and the owner of the Whistling Wizard, Ravvas Thurrpurtyn, were killed instantly.
