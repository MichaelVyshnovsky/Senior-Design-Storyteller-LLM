'''Daeros Dragonspear''' was a 13{{th}} century half-[[dwarven]] adventurer best known for having built [[Dragonspear Castle]].

==Description==
As a half-dwarf, Daeros was thickset and muscular like his dwarven kin but with the height of a [[human|man]].According to [[Ghosts of Dragonspear Castle]], the in-universe book ''[[Dawn of Daeros]]'' refers to him as a "[[human]] adventurer of [[dwarf]]-like stature."

==Possessions==
Daeros carried a massive [[spear]], rumored to be over 40 feet (12.2 meters) in length. He wore a finely-crafted suit of [[Daeros's full plate|full plate armor]], made for him by the dwarves of [[Kanaglym]].

==Activities==
After retirement, Daeros spent much of his time riding atop Halatathlaer as the two soared over the [[High Moor]]. Despite the dragon's age and Daeros's "retirement", they pushed back encroaching monstrous creatures like [[troll]]s and [[orc]]s until the moor was seemingly free from their kind.

==Relationships==
Daeros was a devoted friend to his life-long companion Halatathlaer.

==History==
===Early Life and Retirement===
During his early adventuring years, Daeros saved the [[copper dragon]] [[Halatathlaer]] from some unknown peril and the two forged a fast friendship.

Some time later Daeros recovered a great collection of valuable [[gem]]s, taken from the lair of a [[beholder]]

As Daeros had amassed this great wealth, and his dragon companion had grown weary in his old age, he decided to settle down and retire. Daeros decided to build a home for him and his friend his home on the land above Halatathlaer's lair. Daeros rallied all the men and [[dwarves]] to whom he was loyal and they built the grand castle that assumed the Dragonspear name.

The dwarf and the dragon enjoyed their retirement for over 30 years.{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report}} It became a haven for dwarves of the region and many chose it as the site to build their homes.

===Death===
Unfortunately for Daeros and Halatathlaer, the [[mage]] [[Ithtaerus Casalia]] wanted all the riches they had amassed. One night in the {{YearlinkName|1290}}, the mage used a unique [[spell]] that allowed him to send away Halatathlaer as is it lay sleeping, by means of ''teleportation''. He then created a ''[[portal]]'' to the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]], that could only be opened with a mortal sacrifice, and made Daeros believe Halatathlaer was hidden away on the other side.

Wracked with grief and rage, Daeros drew his [[weapon]]s and ran through the portal — only to be instantly killed. Daeros's death opened the ''portal'' and let loose several [[baatezu]]. While the dwarves of the castle fought off the [[devil]]s, Ithtaerus raided Halatathlaer's lair. Not only did he steal the dragon's hoard,

===Legacy===
The spirit of Daeros Dragonspear lingered within the basement of his castle, well into the mid–14{{th}} century. He was forced to see the gradual destruction of his home and legacy, as repeated fiendish incursions were released via the ''portal'' to terrorize the [[Sword Coast]].

''[[Dawn of Daeros]]'' was a children's book that detailed his life and death.
