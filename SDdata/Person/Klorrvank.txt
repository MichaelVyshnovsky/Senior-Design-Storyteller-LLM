'''Klorrvank''' was a fisherman from the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|Trust me â€“ you don't want to eat these.|Klorrvank}}

==Description==
Klorrvank was a [[dragonborn]] man with brown hide and scaling. He wore a simple tan-colored tunic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, as the [[Absolute crisis]] ravaged the Gate, Klorrvank's fishing business was damaged further by pollution of the [[Gray Harbor]]. Fishers in the Lower City kept pulling up [[net]]s filled with fish covered in black [[oil]]y goo. Klorrvank worked diligently, waiting for the next fishing boat once it was clear that most of the catch was spoiled and inedible. In reality, the fish were smothered in oil pollution left behind by a [[submersible]] used by the [[Cult of Bane]] to transport [[Lord Gortash]]'s prisoners into the drowned [[Iron Throne headquarters]] prison at the bottom of Gray Harbor.
