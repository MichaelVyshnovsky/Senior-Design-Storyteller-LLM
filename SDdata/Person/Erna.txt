'''Erna''' was a guardswoman who worked for the [[Zhentarim]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|Wouldn't go in there, 'less you fancy blowing your bones all the way to [[Baldur's Gate]].|Erna.}}

==Description==
Erna wore a suit of [[leather]] armor and a helmet that masked her visage. She had black tattoos that covered portions of her face, around her eyes and chin.

==Possessions==
Her preferred weapon was a simple [[longbow]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Erna and her fellow guard [[Yerle]] accompanied [[Roah Moonglow]] during her dealings with the [[cult of the Absolute]] at the [[Shattered Sanctum]]. The Zhentarim traded [[smokepowder]] for slaves that were taken captive by cult raiders. The duo watched over a chamber in the sanctum that housed over a dozen barrels of the highly-combustible smokepowder.
