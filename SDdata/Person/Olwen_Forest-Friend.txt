'''Olwen Forest-Friend''' was a human [[ranger]] active in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was a hero and later duke of [[Damara]] who helped to defeat [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] of [[Vaasa]].

==Appearance==
He was a bear of a man with a muscular chest and bulging arms who often spoke with a booming voice. He usually wore a forest-green cloak.

==Personality==
Olwen was a man of strong emotions whose laughter could shake walls

==Abilities==
Olwen was an extremely adept and powerful ranger, and although he specialized in martial combat, he also knew several [[druid]]ic spells.

For many years, his favorite weapon was his ''[[longbow of the forest]]'', which he used to fire [[magical]] [[arrows]] that he crafted himself, including ''[[Arrow of slaying|arrows of slaying]]''. He was deadly at both long range and point-blank. Despite his age and bulk, Olwen was an incredibly dangerous melee fighter.

==Possessions==
In addition to his enchanted ''longbow of the forest'' and ''Treefeller'' waraxe, Olwen possessed and made use of a pair of ''[[boots of speed]]'', a ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]'', a ''[[ring of free action]]'', and ''[[bracers of archery]]''. 

==Relationships==
Olwen was close and trusted friends with King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of Damara, having adventured with him to save the land from Zhengyi alongside [[Celedon Kierney]], [[Emelyn the Gray]], [[Friar Dugald]], [[Kane]], and [[Riordan Parnell]].

The famous ranger [[Mariabronne]] was his protégé for many years, being as a son to him. He held an unyielding hatred for [[Artemis Entreri]], whom he incorrectly blamed for Mariabronne's death.

==History==
Olwen hailed originally from the woods of northern Damara, and first gained fame when he led a force of rangers to foil the plot of an evil [[wizard]] attempting to wipe out the [[treant]]s of his home forest, a struggle which resulted in the deaths of all his followers.<ref group="note">The ''[[Bloodstone Pass]]'' and ''[[The Mines of Bloodstone]]'' adventures give his home as the [[Forest of Arlen]], however this location is not mentioned in subsequent publications coinciding with the inclusion of these adventures into the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting. It is therefore not clear whether the "Forest of Arlen" is meant to refer to a location in [[Faerûn]], or if it was simply retconned out of existence. The grateful treants awarded him a ''longbow of the forest'' and the knowledge of how to craft magical arrows. Despite the victory, the loss of his followers weighed heavily on Olwen, and as the forces of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] claimed his homeland during the [[Vaasan War]], he dejectedly made his way south. Ultimately, however, the call for help from the people of [[Bloodstone Village]] caused him to put his sorrows aside and join [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s quest to save [[Bloodstone Pass]] from bandits in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

Olwen trained and led a force of archers known as the Huntsmen Skirmishers within the Bloodstone army, and was knighted by Baron [[Tranth]] for his services. He soon became a hero to the people of Bloodstone Village, especially among the children. In addition to his role as a military commander, taking part in both the fight against the bandits as well as the [[Bloodstone Wars]] a year later, Olwen was an important member of Gareth Dragonsbane's expeditions to clear [[Bloodstone Mines]], assault the [[Citadel of Assassins]], and slay Zhengyi at [[Castle Perilous]]. During these exploits, he preferred to remain in the background, serving as his party's archer.

Following Zhengyi's defeat and the victory over his forces at the [[Ford of Goliad]] in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, Olwen was given charge of leading the forces of Damara to sweep the remainder of the Witch-King's armies from the [[Duchy of Soravia]], an administrative district created by Zhengyi which spanned most of northeastern Damara. Olwen implemented a plan he called the "five S's," which called for ''squashing'' the Vaasan remnants, ''supplying'' the outlying Damaran villages, ''securing'' the region, ''seeding'' support for Gareth's claim to the throne of Damara, and ''scouting'' the borders with Vaasa and [[Narfell]]. After several skirmishes, Olwen drove off the last of Zhengyi's occupiers near [[Steppenhall]] before the end of the year, suffering serious personal injuries in the process. Olwen's efforts to liberate northern Damara were in part motivated by his desire to be granted the title of Duke of Soravia, a position which he was indeed granted sometime after 1359 DR.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Olwen returned to the battlefield alongside his king to put down the upstart [[Kingdom of D'aerthe]], which had been proclaimed in northeastern [[Vaasa]] by the [[drow]] [[Jarlaxle]] and the [[assassin]] Artemmis Entreri.
