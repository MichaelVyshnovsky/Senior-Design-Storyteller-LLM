        "mainbody": "'''Kai Chiang Lung''' was a [[chiang lung]] [[dragon]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].",
        "Activities": "Kai was a chiang lung dragon residing at the bottom of [[Lake Sari]]. He could be summoned on nights of a full moon. If the summoners offered a treasure, Kai would fulfill a request. He preferred painters, writers, and scholars. Kai took his vigilance over the lake very seriously and was angered at anyone who violated the beauty of his lake. During summer days, Kai ''[[polymorph]]ed'' himself into [[human]] in a drifting [[rowboat]] and indulged in philosophical discussions with boaters."
