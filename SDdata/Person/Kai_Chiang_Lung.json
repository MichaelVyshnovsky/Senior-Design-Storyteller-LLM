If the summoners offered a treasure, Kai would fulfill a request. He preferred painters, writers, and scholars. Kai took his vigilance over the lake very seriously and was angered at anyone who violated the beauty of his lake. During summer days, Kai polymorphed himself into human in a drifting rowboat and indulged in philosophical discussions with boaters."
