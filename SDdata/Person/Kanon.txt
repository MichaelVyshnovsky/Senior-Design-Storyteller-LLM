Kanon was a resident of Elturel who was exiled from his home city along with other tieflings during the late 15 century DR.
He had light, red-grey skin, two large black horns, and wore a long grey robe.
Kanon had one known sibling, a sister by the name of Arka.
In the , the Elturian tieflings were forced out of the city as refugees, forced to find a new home somewhere on the Sword Coast. They were were granted temporary refuge at the Emerald Grove, by the aarchdruid Master Halsin. The safe haven they received ended however when  a druid named Kagha tried to seal away the grove from the tieflings, by means of the Rite of Thorns ritual.
When a band of goblins chased the adventurers Aradin, Barth, and Remira, away from the Shattered Sanctum, they were brough to the doorstop of the Emerald Grove. The goblins launched a middling assault against the grove, and their archers managed to shoot down Kanon atop the walkway atop its massive front gate.
