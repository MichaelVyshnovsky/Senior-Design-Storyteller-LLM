Silfys job was to distract passersby so they could more easily be pickpocketed.\nIn the , Elturel was pulled down into the Nine Hells for a brief party. The catastophe, which came to be known as the Descent, led to the mass-exodus of tieflings from the city, an action made against their will. The tieflings rallied under the leadership of Zevlor, a former member of the citys Hellriders. For a time, the Elturian tieflings were able to find temporary safe haven in the druidic stronghold of the Emerald Grove."
