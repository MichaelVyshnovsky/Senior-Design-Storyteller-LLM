        "Description": "She had pale white skin and horns that protruded outwards and down.",
        "Activities": "Silfy was one of the members of [[Mol]]'s, exiled tiefling children who found purpose in a life of crime. Silfy's job was to distract passersby so they could more easily be pickpocketed.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Elturel was pulled down into the [[Nine Hells]] for a brief party. The catastophe, which came to be known as [[the Descent]], led to the mass-exodus of tieflings from the city, an action made against their will. The tieflings rallied under the leadership of [[Zevlor]], a former member of the city's [[Hellriders]]. For a time, the Elturian tieflings were able to find temporary safe haven in the [[druid]]ic stronghold of the [[Emerald Grove]]."
