Polma was an ogre bodyguard who served the cult of the Absolute in late 15 century DR.
The mighty ogress wore a cloth harness and crude loincloth. She had gray hair she kept worn up, in curls and messy clumps.
She acted as the personal bodyguard for High Priestess Gut, a True Soul of the Absolute.
Polma wielded what appeared to be a giant tree branch as a makeshift greatclub.
