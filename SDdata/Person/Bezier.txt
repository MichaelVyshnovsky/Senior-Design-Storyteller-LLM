'''Bezier''' was a renowned [[Mathematics|mathematician]] working in [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

He was once student of the great mathematician [[Furier]]; though not as great, he was still one of the best in [[Faer√ªn]]. However, at over 80 years of age, he was rumored to have become feebleminded by [[1358 DR]]. He had many scribes and sages working under him.
