        "mainbody": "Taggot Ironshroud was a dwarf adventurer from Sundabar in the Silver Marches who joined a group of fellow dwarves aiding Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nHe had a strong affinity for the history of the dwarven people and considered himself an ally of the other free folk of the North.\nHe was a companion of Skeld Steelhelm of Mithral Hall, Gord Roundshield of Citadel Felbarr, and Tori Hammerheart of Citadel Adbar.Skeld refers to a \"handful of heroes\" and lists these four dwarfholds, but only names Gord. As Skeld, Gord, Taggot, and Tori all give Lore entries about their respective dwarfholds and have dwarf-specific quests, it may be assumed that all four were part of the same group.\nTaggot was a known associate of Sergeant Yates of the Neverwinter Guard. He had a low opinion of one Melkhor Goldseeker, believing him to be greedy, unscrupulous, and a shame to the dwarven people.\nIn the , the four dwarf companions came to Neverwinter to offer their aid to the beleaguered city.\nTaggot worked out of the Broken Crown inn on the High Road, helping the folks of Neverwinter with the Blackdagger Bandits that plagued the area around Raven Cliff Beach. He worked with fellow dwarven adventurers to collapse some goblin tunnels that were dug into the nearby cliffs.\nAlso around that time, he led the efforts to search the caves near Cragmire Keep for artifacts from the ancient dwarven kingdom of Delzoun. He sought to retrieve them in order to preserve dwarven culture, rather than make a profit of them like the avaricious Melkhor."
