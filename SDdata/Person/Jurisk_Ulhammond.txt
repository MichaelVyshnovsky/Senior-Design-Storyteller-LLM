Jurisk Ulhammond was a moneylender of Waterdeep, as well as the leader of the Trades Ward cell of the Red Sashes.
Jurisk was one of only two members of the Sashes, along with Naneatha Lharilstar, that knew the true identity of their secretive leader, known only as "The One".
After running into a greater doppelganger called Ptola, who was a member of the Unseen, Jurisk fell and his identity was stolen by the shapeshifter. Hlaavin, the leader of the Unseen, was undecided about what to do with their new-found position.
