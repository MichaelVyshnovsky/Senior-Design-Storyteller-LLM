        "mainbody": "The '''Ghost Stag''' was an elusive white [[deer|stag]] that lived near [[Stag Steads]] in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]]. Some hunters returned to the Stead year after year in hopes of catching it, for it was said to vanish, fading into nothingness, when cornered. Senior [[War Wizard]]s who frequented the Stead said that the Ghost Stag was a living beast, not an [[undead]], but possessed of a natural teleportation ability and perhaps other [[psionics]] that allowed it to escape spells."
