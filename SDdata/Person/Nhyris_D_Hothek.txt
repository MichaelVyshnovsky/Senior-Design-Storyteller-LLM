Nhyris DHothek, later known as the Murkstalker, was a yuan-ti slaver who possessed the Crown of Horns prior to the Spellplague.
Nhyris was a slaver living in Skullport, working under his uncle Zstulkk Ssarmn of the Iron Ring. At one point he came in possession of the relic the Crown of Horns. During the Spellplague, the crown warped Nyryis body and mind into something unrecognizable, which came to be called the "Murkstalker". As of 1479 DR, he lurked in the lowest part of Skullport, where he preyed on the weak.
