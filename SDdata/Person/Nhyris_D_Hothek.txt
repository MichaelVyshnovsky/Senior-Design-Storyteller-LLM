'''Nhyris D'Hothek''', later known as the '''Murkstalker''', was a [[yuan-ti]] [[slavery|slaver]] who possessed the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' prior to the [[Spellplague]].

==History==
Nhyris was a slaver living in [[Skullport]], working under his uncle [[Zstulkk Ssarmn]] of the [[Iron Ring]]. At one point he came in possession of the relic the ''Crown of Horns''. During the Spellplague, the crown warped Nyryis' body and mind into something unrecognizable, which came to be called the "Murkstalker". As of [[1479 DR]], he lurked in the lowest part of Skullport, where he preyed on the weak.
