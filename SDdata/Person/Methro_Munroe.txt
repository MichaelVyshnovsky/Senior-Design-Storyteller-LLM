'''Methro Munroe''' was a ne'er-do-well who, along with the rest of the Munroe family, harassed inhabitants of [[Liam's Hold]] in [[1372 DR]].
{{quote|''This is just boring now. Why don't we just teach 'em a lesson, Jeth?''|Methro Munroe}}

==Description==
Methro was more reserved and more quiet then his brute older brother [[Jethro Munroe]], but both siblings were equally unsavory.

==Possessions==
Methro wore a pair of [[enchanted]] ''[[gloves of swordplay]]''.

==History==
In 1372 DR, Methro Munroe, along with his "family members", Jethro, [[Yage Munroe|Yage]], and [[Sossi Munroe]], and their dog [[Fang (dog)|Fang]], camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liam's Hold along the [[Trade Way]]. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor [[Wilsey]] enlisted the help of the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the [[Wild Pastures]] and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]]—a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of [[Bhaal]]—in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed.
