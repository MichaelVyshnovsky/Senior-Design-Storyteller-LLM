Methro Munroe was a neer-do-well who, along with the rest of the Munroe family, harassed inhabitants of Liams Hold in 1372 DR.
Methro was more reserved and more quiet then his brute older brother Jethro Munroe, but both siblings were equally unsavory.
Methro wore a pair of enchanted gloves of swordplay.
In 1372 DR, Methro Munroe, along with his "family members", Jethro, Yage, and Sossi Munroe, and their dog Fang, camped out on the outskirts of the hamlet of Liams Hold along the Trade Way. The gang of vagrants quickly became a nuisance and danger to the community after they started harassing and roughing up local farmers. To guarantee the safety of her village, Mayor Wilsey enlisted the help of the individual known as the Hero of Daggerford. The adventurer was investigating mysteriously disappearing cattle on the Wild Pastures and was considered a trusted ally. Mayor offered the Hero the Stronghold—a small keep outside of the hamlet that once belonged to evil cultists of Bhaal—in exchange for driving the Monroe vagrants away without bloodshed.
