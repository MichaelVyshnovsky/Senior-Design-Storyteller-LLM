Farim al-Kanafi was an inhabitant of Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
Farim complained about his job to anyone who would listen.
Farim was a member of the Dauntless and served as the commander of the Gate of Wealth.
Bored with his job, and believing it was not befitting a man of his skills, Farim had no trouble taking bribes, though he referred to them as "tokens of esteem." He never let smugglers into Huzuz, but his "friends" received far less scrutiny when passing through the gates.
