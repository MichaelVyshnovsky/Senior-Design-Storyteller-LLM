|You are looking for [[Halsaime]]. He is not here. He has gone… to [[Druid's Deep]]. You must stop him… the [[Halsaime's staff|staff]]. To reach the Deep, be a [[wolf]], then a [[fish]], then a [[bear]]. Go!

==Description==
Carm had pale skin and short, backswept black hair. She wore a simple white and gray dress and tall boots.

==History==
Around the time of the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]], Carm was caught in [[Thorn Hollow]] by the druids and creatures loyal to the mad druid [[Halsaime]], including [[Drien]], [[Flinbeck]], [[Garick]], [[Larres]], and [[Thomren]]. She was not subverted by the strange power from Halsaime's strange staff, and so his forces grievously wounded her and left her for dead. She survived long enough for [[adventurer]]s from [[Eveningstar]] to find her and receive her cryptic advice about Halsaime in the [[Druid's Deep]] before she perished.
