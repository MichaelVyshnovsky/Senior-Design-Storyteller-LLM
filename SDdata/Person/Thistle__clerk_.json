        "mainbody": "Thistle was a clerk who worked at the largest trading post in Phandalin, Barthens Provisions, in the late 15 century DR.\nThistle would mostly load and unload wagons full of trade goods. When the owner was not in the trading post, Thistle would attend the needs of the customers.\nThe young clerk and his colleague, Ander, worked for Elmar Barthen in 1491 DR.\nNot long after the white dragon Cryovain rampaged through the region, Thistle met Velleen Firecrow, a new assistant at the local Lionshield Coster outpost, and took a liking to her. While trying to get to know her, Velleen began talking about her apocalyptic religious beliefs, which scared Thistle off. Unbeknownst to him, Velleen was an operative for the Cult of Talos."
