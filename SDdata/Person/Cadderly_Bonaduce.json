        "mainbody": "'''Cadderly Bonaduce''' was a [[cleric]] of [[Deneir]] of the [[Edificant Library]] in [[Erlkazar]] and a noted [[adventurer]] of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], even achieving the status of [[Chosen]] of Deneir.",
        "Description": "Standing 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at just under {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}}, Cadderly was a notably handsome man. He had a warm smile, curly brown hair, and gray eyes that cut through someone on the occasions that he got angry. \n\nWhile Cadderly always looked much older than his actual age, this was especially true during his work on the Spirit Soaring temple. His extensive use of [[magic]] during that time made him appear to be at least 100 years old.",
        "Personality": "As a young man he was quite amiable and possessed a great curiosity about the world around him. Later, as he took on the charge of being Deneir's Chosen, he took on a more serious and austere outlook. He committed himself to that role in its entirety, placing its importance above even his loved ones.\n\nWhile he strove for justice, Cadderly was not overly severe but rather displayed acts of great mercy.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Chosen Powers": "Due to his status as the Chosen of Deneir, Cadderly was not required to pray for [[spell]]s like other clerics. Rather he could study the [[rune]]s within the ''[[Tome of Universal Harmony]]'' and uncover the single song that unified them all. He could draw from all the [[sphere]]s of influence and could cast a high number of [[spell]]s of varying power before suffering horrendous pain.\n\nHis status also bestowed upon him a number of boons, including the power to destroy [[undead]] with a mere touch of his [[holy symbol]], a form of branding mark that would cause an [[evil]] individual to be shunned by others, immunity to [[energy drain]], as well as the ability to transform into a [[flying squirrel|white flying squirrel]]."
        },
        "Possessions": "[[File:Cadderly Bonaduce.JPG|thumb|150px|right|''Cadderly with his walking stick.'']]\nCadderly owned a number of unique and imaginative devices that were quite valuable for adventuring and if needed, combat. \n\nCadderly walked with a multipurpose [[silver]] walking stick, adorned with a cap was sculpted into the shape of a [[ram]]'s head. It was [[magic]]ally [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] by the [[wizard]] [[Belisarius]] of Caradoon. The walking stick was hollow and its cap could be removed, effectively turning it into a working [[blowgun]]. Unfortunately, it was destroyed in a fight with the [[vampire]] [[Kierkan Rufo]].\n\nHe had invented a device called a ''[[Light Tube]]'', a cylindrical item within which was a ''[[continual light]]'' cast by the [[Sunite]] [[priest]]ess [[Histra]]. The end of the tube had an adjustable aperture, allowing Cadderly to focus or broaden the light as needed.\n\nCadderly wore a hollowed-out, feathered ring that contained potent [[drow sleep poison]]. He would use [[cat]] claws dipped in the poison affixed to the ring's feather as makeshift darts, which could then be fired as projectiles using his walking-stick-blowgun.\n\nPerhaps his most unique possessions were his [[spindle-disk]]s, amusing curios based on ancient [[halfling]] weapons from the tribes of southern [[Luiren]]. While he normally used them to pass time, he found them to be a destructive weapon in a pinch.> This improved weapon could break an exposed limb, or crush a man's jaw, cheekbones, and forehead and knock out every tooth he had in a single blow.<ref>\n\nCadderly's only \"true\" weapon was his unique [[hand crossbow]]. It was crafted by the [[dwarven]] brothers [[Ivan Bouldershoulder|Ivan]] and [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]], based on Cadderly's schematics, which was in turn was inspired by an ancient [[drow]] design. \n\nWhile he wore rather dull beige robes, Cadderly had a distinctive wide-rimmed blue hat ornamented with a [[porcelain]] relief of Deneir's [[holy symbol]]. Over his robes he wore his distinctive [[bandoleer]], which held sixteen crossbow [[bolt]]s filled with a destructible capsule containing ''[[oil of impact]]''.\n\nDuring the battle of Shilmista, he claimed a magical [[onyx]] ring from the defeated wizard Dorigen, which was capable of blasting forth lines of fire.<ref>",
        "Activities": "Following the destruction he saw during his adventuring years, Cadderly's great purpose was the construction of a grand cathedral where priests of every [[good]] [[deity]] could congregate and worship. This cathedral was known as [[Spirit Soaring]]. He constructed the structure using only [[divine magic]] bestowed upon him by Deneir. He aged greatly while constructing Spirit Soaring, to a point where he appeared to be over a century old, and was expected to die. Cadderly accepted this fate as a sacrifice that was necessary for the completion of the monumental library. But soon after its completion, the aging process reversed and Cadderly's appearance rapidly reverted to that of a man in his late twenties.",
        "Relationships": "He had an ally in [[Dorigen Kel Lamond]]. While they two had come to blows during Cadderly's battle against the monstrous armies of Castle Trinity, he spared Dorigen's life and helped her on her path to self-discovery.<ref>\n\nCadderly was acquainted with the [[sage]] [[Gorion]] and considered him to be quite the good man.\n\nHe married [[Danica Maupoissant]] and together they had three children, the twins [[Temberle Bonaduce|Temberle]] and [[Hanaleisa Bonaduce|Hanaleisa]], and [[Rorick Bonaduce|Rorick]].",
        "History": "[[File:Cadderly spirit soaring.png|thumb|''Cadderly Bonaduce in front of the [[Spirit Soaring]].''|420x420px]]\nCadderly was born in [[Carradoon]] on the shores of [[Impresk Lake]], as the son of [[Aballister Bonaduce]] and a woman of unknown name. At a young age his father left him to be raised by priests at the Edificant Library in the [[Snowflake Mountains]]. He lived a joyful and somewhat sheltered life there, into his early 20s. During his time at the Edificant Library, Cadderly befriended a white squirrel, which he named [[Percival]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Aballister came back into his son's life only to manipulate the young man for his own gain. Aballister had joined a cabal of [[mage]]s at [[Castle Trinity]] and developed the [[Chaos Curse]], a potion that [[Barjin]], the overseer of Castle Trinity, smuggled into the catacombs beneath Edificant Library before unleashing it upon the residents of the library. With the help of Danica, [[Newander]], and the Bouldershoulder dwarves, Cadderly was able to defeat Barjin and destroy the horde of [[undead]] that was under his control.\n\nThat same year, he and his allies were called upon by the [[wild elves]] of [[Shilmista]] to come to their aid. The forest was threatened by the [[ogrillion]] chieftain [[Ragnor]] and his [[goblinoid]] army, who also served Castle Trinity. With the aid of ancient elven magic, Cadderly was able to turn away the rampaging army and help [[Elbereth]] assume leadership over the elves of the forest. Horrified by the devastation he saw during the battle, Cadderly retreated to his home town of Carradoon, to study the ''Tome of Universal Harmony'' away from everyone else.\n\nEnraged at being thwarted twice over by his son, Aballister hired a group of [[Night Masks]] killers led by [[Ghost (assassin)|Ghost]] to murder Cadderly. They sought to use the [[magical item]]s referred to as the ''[[Ghearufu]]'' to assume Danica's body for the assassination. Danica resisted the magic, and Cadderly was able to destroy Ghost and eventually accept his destiny as the Chosen of Deneir.\n\nCadderly first sought to destroy the ''Ghearufu'' items, enlisting the aid of the [[red dragon]] [[Fyrentennimar]] to do so. In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, he rallied his allies to march on Castle Trinity and stop his father once and for all. Cadderly killed Aballister in a great [[spell]]-battle, leaving Castle Trinity abandoned.\n\nWhen Cadderly and his allies returned to Edificant Library, they discovered that Kierkan Rufo had consumed the Chaos Curse and been transformed into a powerful [[vampire]]. The library had been utterly devastated and nearly all of its attendants and scholars had been slain. Through sheer determination and resourcefulness, Cadderly and his friends were able to overcome the scores of undead who had been turned or raised by Kierkan Rufo, then destroy the vampire himself. But the Edificant Library itself was destroyed, leading Cadderly begin construction of its successor, Spirit Soaring.\n\nIn the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], during the battle against the [[Crenshinibon]]-infused [[dracolich]] [[Hephaestus]], the temple of Spirit Soaring took massive damage. This destruction rapidly aging Cadderly by a number of decades. After the battle, Hephaestus retreated to the [[Plane of Shadow]] to recover and heal. Cadderly chased him into that [[plane]], taking over the mantle of Ghost King as Hephaestus retreated from Cadderly's divine light. Walking between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Shadowfell]], Cadderly was considered to be of both worlds and neither. He condemned himself to walk this ward eternally to prevent Hephaestus terrorizing the Material Plane if ever the dracolich decided to return."
