Vaug the Strong was a leader within the Tornskulls tribe of orcs that dwelled in the Dead Orc Pass of the Rauvin Mountains. He commanded the 80 orcs that fought under his name, within the Claw of Vaug.
While Vaug was a fierce warrior, the orcs under his command were not particularly vigilant in their duties.
Among Vaugs possessions was a +1 frost handaxe.
Vaug was well-supported by his cunning lieutenant Anya, and the priest of Gruumsh, Old Puchk. In turn, Vaug served War-leader Koront.
