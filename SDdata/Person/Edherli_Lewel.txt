Edherli Lewel was a merchant just before the Tyranny of Dragons.
The merchant was an impatient individual but took great care with her wagon and horse.
Around 1489 DR, Edherli was traveling from Chult to Waterdeep to sell exotic woods. She attached her wagon to a great caravan, which unknown to her was full of Cult of the Dragon agents transporting treasures for the Hoard of the Dragon Queen.
