'''Edherli Lewel''' was a merchant just before the [[Tyranny of Dragons]].

==Personality==
The merchant was an impatient individual but took great care with her wagon and horse.

==History==
Around [[1489 DR]], Edherli was traveling from [[Chult]] to [[Waterdeep]] to sell exotic woods. She attached her wagon to a great caravan, which unknown to her was full of [[Cult of the Dragon]] agents transporting treasures for the [[Hoard of the Dragon Queen]].
