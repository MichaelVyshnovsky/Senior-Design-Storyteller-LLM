Yssaria was a merchant in Luskan during the late 15 century DR. 
Some time before 1490 DR, Yssaria received a package he did not order that contained a sentient mounted fish, whom Yssaria came to call Teacher. Over the next few months, on the Teachers instructions, Yssaria attempted to train a zombie called Joslin, preparing the undead for possession by the Teacher. However, Yssaria was unsuccessful in his attempts at necromancy, and had to tie Joslin up in his upstairs bedroom because he was getting too violent.
