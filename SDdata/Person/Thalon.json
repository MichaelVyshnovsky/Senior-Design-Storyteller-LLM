After her apprentice [[Blaskyn]] betrayed her, incapacitated her and sat on the throne instead, Thalon was reformed in Blaskyn's body. Laeral managed to narrowly slay him before he cooked and ate her.\n\nPosthumously, Thalon somehow made his name the only one in Laeral's list of prospective apprentices; Laeral resolved to annihilate his throne as soon as possible.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "''[[Thalon's Throne]]'', presumably created by him, was the subject of a popular rhyme.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|242-246|16}}"
