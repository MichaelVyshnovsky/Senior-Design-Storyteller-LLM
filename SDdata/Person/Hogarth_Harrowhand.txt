'''Hogarth Harrowhand''' was the head of the [[Trappers guild (Graevelwood)|trappers guild]] of the [[Graevelwood]] clanhold of [[rock gnome]]s during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Although his clan was rather secretive, and didn't reveal their location in the [[Arn Forest]], they did often sell the pelts of [[beaver]]s, among other animals, with traders in [[Deadsnows]] or [[Citadel Adbar]].

Like many in his clan, Hogarth was an expert scout, and as per his role in the community, an exceptional trapper.
