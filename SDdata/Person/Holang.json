        "mainbody": "Lady '''Holang''' was a consort of Baron [[Mukow Jian]] and the true ruler of the town of [[Pim Tung]] in [[Tabot]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.",
        "History": "Born to a wealthy family of [[T'u Lung]], Holang was kidnapped when she was a child and sold as a slave in [[Motra]] before she was of marriageable age. For her beauty, Baron Mukow Jian of Pim Tung bought her as a house slave, but later took her as his third wife.\n\nIgnoring the warnings of the other wives, Holang spied on the Baron until she uncovered his secret activities—building a secret rebel army—and until he caught her. Though he threatened to kill her, Holang saved herself by giving him better and more honest counsel than any of his advisors, thanks to her T'u Lung education and frank speech. Mukow let her live and started consulting her in secret, and thanks to her he found successes. Holang even disguised herself as a man and joined his secret army, the [[Vian-chi]], and trained to fight as a [[ninja]].\n\nAt age 34, Holang was Mukow's favored wife and her son was chosen as Mukow's heir. By 2607, Lady Holang had complete control over Pim Tung and commanded her own spies and warriors, and still had greater ambitions.",
        "Activities": "Lady Holang was the effective ruler of Pim Tung and the local dzong-pon (sheriff or district official) was her puppet, while the warriors of Pim Tung were her men. But Holang was plotting nothing less than the overthrow of the High Lord of Oceans [[Ning D'Ahn]] himself and turning Tabot into an empire much like T'u Lung, and to make her husband its emperor, and she its empress.\n\nThus, she'd had her spies infiltrate [[Jo'nai Gompa]] at all levels and she sent more to the capital at [[U'Chan Gompa]]. Her agents were common in Motra and [[Joya]] and bluntly interrogated anyone who passed through her lands, though Holang would allow free passage upriver to [[Phutan]] for those who paid. Moreover, she was in communication with the rebel Baron [[Phen Do]] of [[Khampo]].",
        "Description": "Holang was doe-eyed and beautiful, even in middle age, with long black hair. She was taller than most [[Tabotan]] women."
