Mara was a nixie living in Zhent-occupied Daggerdale in 1367 DR.
Mara lived in a cavern inside the Crypt of the Mage-lord.
In 1367 DR, Colderan Morn filled the Crypt with his nightshades. Mara managed to expel them from her home and tried to stop them from wandering in Dagger Falls, but she needed spells and couldnt stop night-roving wood woses.
