'''Frinli Hinkille''' was a quick and confident [[hin]] cook of the [[Yawning Portal]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Frinli was present at the inn along with her fellow cook [[Merin Falle]] and the foul-tempered chef. A squadron of [[drow]] [[assassin]]s emerged from the Yawning Portal's descent to [[Undermountain]] and started slaughtering adventurers gathered in its common room. Even though the attackers were repelled back into the dungeon, Frinli's worries over a fellow line cook over-[[spice]]ing dishes started to seem like less of an issue.
