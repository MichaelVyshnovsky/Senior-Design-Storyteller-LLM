        "History": "Prior to becoming Magister, Velgorn Kataclath was the seneschal of a stronghold which his adventuring band used as a stop. He had been part of that band once, but had since retired, hoping to become a farmer.\n\nVelgorn acquired the title while defending his stronghold from an invading [[Ozgor Hyelvel]], without seeking it. Soon after the fight, challengers who had been grown in power during Ozgor's tenure decided to challenge the new magister; in the process, they laid waste to much of what Velomar had been sworn to protect. He eventually fled his home to draw these challengers away from it.\n\nHe soon tired nonetheless, and talked to Mystra. He decided to promote magic as a wild thing, rather than as a tool to gain power over lesser beings; Mystra agreed to transform him into the [[Haunted Flagon]] and find a new [[Magister]]."
