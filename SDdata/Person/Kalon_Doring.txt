Kalon Doring was the last King of Guge in the Hordelands.
It was widely rumored that the gods drove Kalon mad because he dared to challenge the might of the Celestial Emperor. With an army numbering 10,000, Kalon marched onto a frozen glacier searching for the Emperors forces. Kalon and his army were never seen again, though many claimed they haunted the glacier which was later named the Glacier of the Lost King.
