Jamal Elijiwan al-Iwlid was an inhabitant of the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire in 1367 DR.
Jamal ran a thieves guild in the Rookery ward of the city. Jamal never broke the law, but was adept at convincing others to commit crimes that served his interests and those of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.
In order to gain favor with the city guard, Jamal would often turn thieves or escaped slaves over to their hands. His outward actions against thievery made him very popular with both the wealthy and poor of the city. He was well connected with agents of the Octagon, using those contacts to acquire additional thieves for his operation, arranging for their escape from the prison on occasion.
