'''Baiyosho Degi''' was a [[monk]] member of the [[Tairo]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

==History==
Baiyosho was a monk from a family that had always provided generations of faithful servitors to the shogunate. Degi was assured a place as a [[jisha-bugyo]] commissioner, but shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] noticed his great intelligence and fervid devotion to the [[Path of Enlightenment]] and asked him to give a series of private lectures about the Path. During those lectures, Degi explained to the [[shogun]] that the Path advocated a natural hierarchy and so Nagahide had a celestial blessing to rule.

Impressed, the shogun granted Baiyosho a place in the [[Tairo]], as the only non-[[samurai]], and proclaimed the Path the national religion of Wa.

==Personality==
Degli was a fleshy and expressionless individual, a loner who disliked human contact. He was a brilliant scholar and his loyalty to the shogun was absolute.
