'''Hilithiimm Turnstone''' was the master of the [[Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Reputation==
He had the trust of the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], and of the [[nobility of Waterdeep]]. His family was renowned for their discretion about the city's secrets.

==History==
Hilithiimm had managed the Plumbers' Guild efficiently for many years. Hilithiimm hoped one day to transfer his position to his son [[Jhalossan Turnstone]]. However, unknown to anyone, he was mentally enslaved by [[Nexil'Vendyliq]], one of the [[aboleth]]s of the [[Savants of the Dark Tide]]. It permitted Hilithiimm to act normally but had him steer Cellarers away from the aboleth-controlled portions of the sewers and to visit it regularly to renew the enslavement.
