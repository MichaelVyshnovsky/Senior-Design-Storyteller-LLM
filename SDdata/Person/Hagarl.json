        "mainbody": "Hagarl was a doppelganger who assumed the form of a human boy in order to feast on the inhabitants of Beliard.\nPreying on the weak, Hagarl killed horses, dogs, and the weakest travelers journeying through Beliard. He dumped their bodies in a \"kill pit,\" which was located at the north end of Beliards garbage dump. Hagarl would bury the remains under hordes of trash, for later feedings.\nAround 1365 DR, Hagarl worked as a stablehand at Halamars Horses and killed at least four spice merchants."
