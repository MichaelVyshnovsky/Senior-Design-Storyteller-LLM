        "mainbody": "Fylanthalas was allegedly a great mage who lived sometime before 1372 DR.\nThe most notable item in Fylanthalass possession was his crystal ball, used for scrying.\nEven though stories claimed his greatness, Fylanthalas was mostly remembered because of his crystal ball that was famously dropped and cracked as the wizard tried to skip on a dinning bill. The cracked crystal ball was kept in Daggerfords curio shop, Stop Hole Abbey in 1372 DR."
