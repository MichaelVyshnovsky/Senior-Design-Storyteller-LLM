        "History": "Even though stories claimed his greatness, Fylanthalas was mostly remembered because of his ''crystal ball'' that was famously dropped and cracked as the wizard tried to skip on a dinning bill. The cracked ''crystal ball'' was kept in [[Daggerford]]'s curio shop, [[Stop Hole Abbey]] in 1372 DR."
