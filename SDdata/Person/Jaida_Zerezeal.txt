'''Jaida Zerezeal''' was a [[half-elf]] [[ranger]] of the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She held the title of [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlet of the Western Marches]], with the duty of defending Loudwater's territory to the west, until she was replaced by [[Isyan Kiy'sisnos]] in [[Eleasis]]/[[Eleint]] of [[1372 DR]].<ref><ref group="note">Created for the ''[[Legacy of the Green Regent]]'' campaign, Jaida has no involvement in any of the adventure modules and is later replaced by Isyan, with no explanation for the change. Her removal may have been explained in the unreleased ''[[Secret of Phantoms' Cloister]]''. Furthermore, it's unknown if she is western or eastern Gauntlet, but since Harazos is typically the eastern Gauntlet, it is assumed that Jaida is the western.
