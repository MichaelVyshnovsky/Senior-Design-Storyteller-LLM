Sakigahara was a samurai retainer of the Korimori clan in Maeshi Province in Kozakura in 1360 DR. Sakigahara was a lieutenant of Ogaki, the second-in-command of Lord Korimori.
In 1360 DR, Ogaki, Sakigahara, and fellow lieutenant Himeji led a bushi army to a village formally of the Michimori clan. There however an adventuring party, hired by Michimori Uemon to retrieve the Seven Swords, fought and defeated him and his troops.
Sakigahara and Himeji disliked each other and both wanted Ogakis position if he was promoted after their lords victory.
