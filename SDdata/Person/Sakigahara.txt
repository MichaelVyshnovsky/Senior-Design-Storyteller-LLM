'''Sakigahara''' was a [[samurai]] retainer of the [[Korimori clan]] in [[Maeshi Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1360 DR]]. Sakigahara was a lieutenant of [[Ogaki]], the second-in-command of Lord [[Korimori]].

==History==
In 1360 DR, Ogaki, Sakigahara, and fellow lieutenant [[Himeji]] led a [[bushi]] army to a village formally of the [[Michimori clan]]. There however an adventuring party, hired by [[Michimori Uemon]] to retrieve the [[Seven Swords]], fought and defeated him and his troops.

==Relationships==
Sakigahara and Himeji disliked each other and both wanted Ogaki's position if he was promoted after their lord's victory.
