* The warhammer [[Crom Faeyr]]
* The ''[[shortbow of Gesen]]''
* The [[halberd]], ''[[Wave (halberd)|Wave]]''
* The ''[[mace of disruption]]''
* ''[[Red dragon scale]]''
* ''[[Shadow dragon scale]]''

==Possessions==

As well as his forge and dwelling, Cromwell owned, and donned, an enchanted ''+2 [[warhammer]]'' and ''+3 [[chain mail]]''. He also wore an [[open-faced helmet]] for protection.
