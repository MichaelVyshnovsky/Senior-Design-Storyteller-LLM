Vrondiss was a barbarian and adventurer that sought to gain great wealth and glorious exploits across the Sword Coast.
When Vrondiss dove into battle, he entered into a berserker frenzy that bolstered his physical strength and made him resilient to oncoming harm.
As a barbarian that traveled the Path of the Ancestral Guardian, Vrondiss drew upon the wisdom and power bestowed upon him by his draconic ancestors.
He was a member of an adventuring company that included the elven paladin Galea, the tiefling warlock Prosper, and the Red Wizard necromancer Sefris.
