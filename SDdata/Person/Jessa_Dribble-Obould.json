She was a companion of Bruenor Battlehammer and Drizzt DoUrden during the search for Gauntlgrym, the lost kingdom of dwarves.\nJessa was one of the ambassadors of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows to Mithral Hall. In the , she helped Nanfoodle Buswilligan poison Bruenor, but this was only so that he could fake his own death in order to secretly abdicate the throne of Mithral Hall and make Banak Brawnanvil the eleventh king.\nThibbledorf Pwent, distraught over the apparent death of Bruenor, later sought out Nanfoodle and Jessa for answers in the hills outside of Mithral Hall. Upon finding the traitorous pair, he attacked them to get answers. During the fight, however, Drizzt and a very-much-alive Bruenor arrived to stop him.\nAfter that, Jessa, Drizzt, Bruenor, Pwent, and Nanfoodle, set out to find Gauntlgrym and they traveled together for many years."
