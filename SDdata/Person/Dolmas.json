But in [[1370 DR]], he moved to the Hook Ward of Calimport in order to act in the name of a newly hailed Ilmatari saint, [[Asref|Saint Asref]], the patron of slave-liberation movement known as the [[Nadhari]]. Once in Calimport, Dolmas established a mission and shrine within the cellar apartment of [[Row House (Hook Ward)|a rowhouse]].\n\nWithin his first six months living in the Hook Ward, Dolmas had spent a substantial portion of his funds purchasing eight slaves, who he then set free on ships bound to the northern city of [[Waterdeep]]."
