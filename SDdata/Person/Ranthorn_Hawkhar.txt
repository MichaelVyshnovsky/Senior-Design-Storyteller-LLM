'''Ranthorn Hawkhar''' was Captain of the [[Riders of Mistledale]], in [[Mistledale]], the [[Dalelands]], until [[1335 DR]]. In that year, Ranthorn's home was burned by raiders, leading to the death of his family, and Ranthorn lost his legs in the attack. Stepping down as Captain of the Riders, he was taken, by his kin, to be cared for in northern [[Sembia]]. He was succeeded as Captain by [[Darrask Baergil]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/Captain Baergil}}
