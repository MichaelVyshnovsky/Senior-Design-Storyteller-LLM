'''Sammereza "Sammer" Sulphontis''' was a [[factor]] and a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lord of Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Sammer had brown skin and purple eyes. He often dressed in extravagant silk robes.

==Personality==
Sammer was sly and intelligent with a very sharp eye for detail.

==Activities==
Sammer was involved with politics and family feuds back at his home in [[Calimshan]]. He frequently worked against the [[el Synabbat]] family's underhanded dealings in [[Skullport]].

When in Waterdeep he stayed at the [[Purple Palace]] in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]].

==History==
Sammer was originally from Calimshan, but he moved to [[Waterdeep]] in the 1330s DR. As a factor, he spent most of his life traveling far from Waterdeep, making trade deals and working intrigues to shore up rulers who were friendly to his trade. He was also the most infamous factor of Waterdeep, because he usually worked to ensure no tyrant would hamper the flow of trade or misuse their power to impoverish the people. 

==Relationships==
Sammer's elder brother, [[Ahmahd el Sufontis]], was a [[pasha]] in the [[Trades Ward of Calimport]]. Sammer's sister-in-law (Ahmahd's widow) was married to the brother of [[Saida yr Oma yr Pesarkhal el Synabbat]], Sammer's primary "enemy."

Sammer was generally disliked by his fellow Lords of Waterdeep. He, along with [[Khelben Arunsun]] invited [[Mirt]] to become a Lord of Waterdeep within a month of Mirt's arrival in the city.
