        "mainbody": "Gandios Laffabar was the owner and proprietor of the Giants Folly festhall that operated Reddansyr during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nHe was a man that could readily tell a grand story to impressionable adventurers, often leading others on wild-goose-chases that may or may not have led to them in peril. \nThe successful business owner was inadvertently at odds with Patriarch Thyrius Jorman, head of the local temple of Oghma.\nGandios famously lost a wager with a fire giant involving the transportation of a boat inland to Reddansyr from Westgate. Not one to be defeated, Gandios made another bet that won him the boat, and with it a great story and name for his future establishment. \nBusiness was so successful as of the , he thought about bringing over a second boat from Westgate to Reddansyr."
