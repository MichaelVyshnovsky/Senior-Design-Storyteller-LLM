        "Relationships": "The successful business owner was inadvertently at odds with Patriarch [[Thyrius Jorman]], head of the local temple of [[Oghma]].",
        "History": "Gandios famously lost a wager with a [[fire giant]] involving the transportation of a boat inland to Reddansyr from [[Westgate]]. Not one to be defeated, Gandios made another bet that won him the boat, and with it a great story and name for his future establishment. \n\nBusiness was so successful as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, he thought about bringing over a second boat from Westgate to Reddansyr."
