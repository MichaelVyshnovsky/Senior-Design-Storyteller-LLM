'''Brimir''' was renowned [[frost giant]] brewer in [[Jotunheim]], the land of [[giant]]s on the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]], and was the operator of a notable beer-hall and "settlement" in Jotunheim known as [[Okalnir]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|19}}

==Description==
Brimir was a rather old giant, with tanned skin that looked as weathered as stone. He had long and a beard that were both white in hue. He typically wore a [[gold]]en medallion shaped like barrel around his neck.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|20}}

==Personality==
He was a very generous man, more courteous than most of the giants in Jotunheim, and was exceptionally intelligent.

==Abilities==
As a [[cleric]] of the [[Giant pantheon]], Brimir had a handful of [[spell]]s at his disposal. These included ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[endure heat]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[prayer (spell)|prayer]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', ''[[silence]]'', and ''[[tongues]]''.

Additionally, due to the planar faction he was part of, Brimir could potentially make someone magically incapable of raising a hand against him for a time by being generous with them.

==Possessions==
Brimir owned a [[sword]] fit for a giant,{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|23}} that was held captive in the major Jotunheim city of [[Utgard]]. He kept the feather in his bedroom within a clay jar.

==Activities==
Okalnir was both Brimir's place of business and his home. He had his own bedroom in the hall, which was the largest of the hall's bedrooms at a width of {{SI|40|ft}} and a length of {{SI|100|ft}}. Though some claimed he hibernated atop the kegs of [[beer]] in Okalnir's cellar during the winter season, when the hall had less business.

==Relationships==
Among the giants he considered close friends was [[Habrok Icecaster]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|16-17}} When it came to the philosophical planar factions, Brimir was a member of the [[Ring-Givers]] and was one of its few notable giant members.

==History==
Brimir was born in Jotunheim to a giantess by the name of [[Elli]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] journeyed to Jotunheim in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]] so they could learn how to destroy a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]''. While on their journey they potentially encountered Brimir and his hall, though sources differed on why this came about and how it went.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2-3}}

Some sources spoke of them coming to Okalnir as honored guests of Brimir's friend Habrok Icecaster, having proven their worth to him and his friends by hunting a [[bulette]]. He may have struck up a conversation with one or more of these adventurers about the Ring-Givers.

Later that night the Ravenians partook in Okalnir's nightly feast, where the thighs bones of the bulette slain earlier that day were cracked open and roasted. Before the feast began proper, Brimir stood and formally welcomed the party, extending his hospitality and speaking of their courage in the face of battle against the creature, garnering cheer from the assembly of giants. When dinner began to wind down Habrok would tell everyone of how he met the party and of how the bulette hunt began, garnering further applause from the crowd. Brimir then invited the adventurers to tell the story of the hunt themselves, casting ''tongues'' on them so that all assembled would be able to understand.

Another version of events spoke of the giants that were gathered in Okalnir feeling indifferent towards the guests. This drove Brimir to wager a contest of four tests for the adventurers - eating, drinking, running, and wrestling. He was even willing to wager three [[magic item]]s if they would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a ''[[Svartalfheim cloak]]'', a ''[[horn of Valhalla]]'',{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21-22}} and a great war [[maul]] known as ''[[Grungir's hammer]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21,25,36}}

In eating the adventurers faced off against the [[fire giant]] [[Logi]] and had to reach the middle of a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} trencher of stew. In drinking they faced no one, but had to drink alcohol from a massive horn as fast as they could. In running they faced the young giant [[Hugi]] and had to make it to the far end of the hall. Finally, in wrestling they faced Brimir's old mother, as the giants felt any other competitor would make things unfair.

Some claimed the adventurers managed to beat all four tests and for showing such prowess Brimir chose to give them an additional gift, creating the ''[[girdle of Brimir's strength]]''.

Regardless of which of those versions of events occurred, the night in the hall ended with all retiring to bed. On the following day, Brimir treated the adventurers to a breakfast of [[porridge]] before sending them out in the direction of Mimir's Well.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|22}}

A third version of events spoke of the adventurers sneaking into Brimirâ€™s hall on behalf of [[Torheim]], a [[proxy]] of [[Thor]], to steal Brimir's deva feather. Torheim desired the feather so he could more easily track down the deva it came from, wanting to rescue them from their imprisonment in Utgard.
