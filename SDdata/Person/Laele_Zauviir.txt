'''Laele Zauviir''', most knew as '''Streea'Valsharess Zauviir''', was the high priestess of [[Lolth]] in the city of [[Sshamath]] in the year [[1370 DR]].

==History==
In [[1379 DR]] Streea'Valsharess together with her nephew [[Guldor Zauviir]] and [[T'lar Mizz'rynturl]] devised a scheme to gain more power in the [[Conclave of Sshamath]] but failed.

Later they discussed about why their plot failed. T'lar killed Guldor and vanished and the blame for the killing fell to Streea'Valsharess.
After T'lar killed also Streea'Valsharess and took control of her temple.
