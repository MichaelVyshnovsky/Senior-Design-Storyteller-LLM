'''Fitsyll''' was a retired [[adventurer]] who resided in the small village in the vicinity of [[Darnarest's tower]] in [[interior Faerûn]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
Fitsyll had been fully retired and a enjoying quiet life when, in the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, her home village experienced disappearances of some of its inhabitants, who, unknown to her, were taken by the slavers of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to labor in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. When a group of adventurers volunteered to search for the missing villagers, Fitsyll offered her prized enchanted ''+2'' [[shortspear]] as a reward for the villagers' return or at the very least proof of the cause of the disappearance being dealt with.
