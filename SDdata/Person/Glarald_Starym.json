        "mainbody": "'''Glarald Starym''' was an [[elven]] inhabitant of [[Cormanthyr]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "He had one of the forbidden enchantments hidden in [[Felaern Starym]]'s tomb, which allowed him to control wands and scepters from afar. He altered it so that he could also control minds. Another of his abilities allowed him to change people's bodies.",
        "History": "Prior to 241 DR, Glarald Starym took an enchantment from [[Felaern Starym]]'s tomb and adapted it to control a number of minds from a distance. He used that magic to control [[Alais Dree]] and two [[unicorn]]s, then using sorcery to alter Alais Dree's body shape to better suit his tastes.\n\nIn {{yearlink|241}}, Glarald Starym was approached by the [[Srinshee]] as a possible herald of [[Cormanthyr]]. However, while he accepted, his mind was read as part of the process; when he learned of something they'd discovered, he attacked the Srinshee and [[Earynspieir]]. Amongst other things, he used [[Alais Dree]] and two [[unicorn]]s as weapons through forbidden magic. After the Srinshee broke his thrall, they turned on him. He barely survived, and was kept afterwards at [[Thurdan's Tree]], wounded in his wits."
