'''The Butcher''' was one of the followers of [[Gorgomorz]], [[Daggerford]]'s [[Devil]], along with numerous [[orc]]s and [[tanarukk]]a, and was the chieftain of a [[goblin]] tribe from the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].
{{quote|''Uh...[[cow]]s? What cows? No cows here! Uh... That just... uh... cow-shaped rock!''|The Butcher}}

==Personality==
The Butcher was fierce but dim-witted.

==Possessions==
The Butcher was armed with a simple in appearance but [[enchanted]] bludgeon, called ''[[Big Board with Nail]]''. He carried several bottles of magic ''[[Goblin's Grog]]'', a colorful alcoholic concoction that could render its imbiber ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]''.

==History==
In 1372 DR, the Butcher and his cave goblin tribe allied with Gorgomorz's army of orcs and tanarukka. A part of the army established a hideout in caves underneath the [[Wild Pastures]] of [[Liam's Hold]]. Despite orders, the Butcher ordered his goblins to abduct cows from the local shepherds. The strange occurrence attracted the attention of the [[Hero of Daggerford]], who agreed to help the shepherds in investigating the disappearances. Eventually, goblin tracks led the Hero towards the well-hidden goblin lair. The adventurer walked in on the Butcher's attempts at convincing his tanarukk superior that the cow carcass the goblin was standing on was, in fact, a cow-shaped rock. Eventually, the inhabitants of the caves attacked the trespasser and perished in the process.
