'''Perrin Clovenshield''' was the [[human]] Captain of the [[Purple Dragons]] in [[Halfhap]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], Perrin commanded the Purple Dragons garrison as it defended the region from threats emerging from the [[Stonelands]]. He performed his duties from Halfhap's Constabulary, as well as acting as [[Cormyr]]'s representative and ''de facto'' mayor of the town. Under his command, the Purple Dragons patrolled along the [[Moonsea Ride]] to [[Gnollpost]] in [[Gnoll Pass]], and to [[Mootpost]] halfway to [[Tilverton]].

He kept his troops in good order, in particular preventing them from being overly rowdy or rambunctious at the [[Doffed Cloak]] [[festhall]].
