Perrin Clovenshield was the human Captain of the Purple Dragons in Halfhap in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Circa 1369 DR, Perrin commanded the Purple Dragons garrison as it defended the region from threats emerging from the Stonelands. He performed his duties from Halfhaps Constabulary, as well as acting as Cormyrs representative and de facto mayor of the town. Under his command, the Purple Dragons patrolled along the Moonsea Ride to Gnollpost in Gnoll Pass, and to Mootpost halfway to Tilverton.
He kept his troops in good order, in particular preventing them from being overly rowdy or rambunctious at the Doffed Cloak festhall.
