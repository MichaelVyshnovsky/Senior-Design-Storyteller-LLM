        "mainbody": "The woman only known as the Prioress was a High Priestess of Umberlee, the High Prioress of the Priory of the Depths on the Sword Coast North, and a one-time member of the Kraken Society in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Prioress was a stunningly beautiful aquatic elf with blue eyes, blue skin, slicked-back green hair, and a powerful, self-important attitude.\nThe Prioress wore a golden circlet on her head and had a powerful ring of divine power on her finger.\nThe Prioress joined the Kraken Society long before the . However, that affiliation came to an end after a betrayal by one of the Societys members – a High Captains of Luskan. That High Captain requested the aid of The Prioress divine magic to aid him in a plan that would benefit Luskan greatly. Luskar saw an opportunity in the coastal roads being dangerous and unguarded following the Shadow War between the King of Shadows and Neverwinter. The port town of Port Llast lost much of its Neverwintran garrison, making it vulnerable to the Luskan who sought to claim it. The High Captains of Luskan sent The Platinum Pride, seizing Port Llast with no bloodshed. Neverwinter, unable to send its troops to Port Llast by land due to dangers and delays, sent it by the sea. This was where The Prioress came into play. She used Umberlees divine magic to shield Port Llast from Lord Nasher Alagondars ship. Luskar planned on the locals accepting the new government under the false pretense of there being no bloodshed.\nWhen the deed was done, Luskar refused to pay the Prioress for her services. Seething with anger over the betrayal, she arose the storms, battering the Luskar ships, preventing northern reinforcements, and trapping the The Platinum Pride. She demanded what was due to be paid. Soon after, a group of adventurers that worked with merchant SaSani arrived at Port Llast by land. They met with the Luskar, who asked for aid against the \"mad\" priestess who had already killed an envoy – a Luskar official named Khralver Irilingstar‎.\nIt was unrecorded how the adventurers dealt with The Prioress after braving the challenges of the Priory of the Depths. Some believed that the adventurers quelled Umberlees wrath with gold. The Prioress demanded 6,000 gp – a fee to stop the storms and offered her aid in destroying The Platinum Pride and helping the adventurers in throwing the Luskar out of Port Llast for a tithe of additional 4,000 gold pieces. By other accords, The Prioress was slain by the Luskar command."
