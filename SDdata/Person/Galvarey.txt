Galvarey was an ambitious Harper fighter of the 1360s DR.
Galvarey led a Harper cell in Athkatla from his estate, which was also frequented by some spectral harpists.
After Gorions Ward worked for Berinvar in 1369 DR, Galvarey summoned the adventurer to  his estate. However, it was a trap because Galvarey plotted to imprison the Bhaalspawn using a powerful spell and Gorions Ward was forced to kill him.
