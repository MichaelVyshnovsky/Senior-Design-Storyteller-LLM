'''Galvarey''' was an ambitious [[Harper]] [[fighter]] of the 1360s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Galvarey led a Harper cell in [[Athkatla]] from his estate, which was also frequented by some [[spectral harpist]]s.

==History==
After [[Gorion's Ward]] worked for [[Berinvar]] in [[1369 DR]], Galvarey summoned the adventurer to  his estate. However, it was a trap because Galvarey plotted to imprison the [[Bhaalspawn]] using a powerful spell and Gorion's Ward was forced to kill him.
