'''Rinara''' was a [[rogue]] member of the [[Night Masks]] who lived in [[Westgate]] before [[1371 DR]].

{{quote|''Do I not strike you as the altruistic type? Well let's just say that it helps to have powerful allies in Westgate... especially if you've lived here long enough to make some equally powerful enemies. All ask is that you back me up if we run into any... trouble. Trouble comes in all varieties in this city. Considering the troubles you've brought with you, I'd say you're getting the better deal here.''|Rinara}}

==Activities==
When the was working for the Ninth Masks, Rinara was commonly known as the Lady of Shivs, or simply as the Ripper. She was a collector for the guild – the individual who collected protection racket money, few resisted, but those who did found out how Rinara earned her nicknames. Rinara would remove their body parts beginning with non-essential ones. Despite the gruesome deeds, she never enjoyed the torture, not as much as her partner, [[Viglor]] of the Night Masks did.

==History==
Rinara was a young member of the Night Masks when she, along with eight other members of the guild were attacked by then-paladin of [[Lathander]] named [[Mantides]]. The paladin went into zealous rage and slaughtered all Night Masks that came across his path after the disappearance of his lover [[Tasheni]]. The youngest man who was killed in what would be known as the [[Sword Lane]] massacre of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, was not yet eighteen winters. Rinara was the only one to survive, after dodging swings of Mantides's ''[[Dawnbringer (sword)|Dawnbringer]]''. Several years prior, a meddling [[Harper]] agent named [[Alias]] disposed of the guild's leadership and those to came to power next, were hard and unforgiving. The new leaders thought street level operatives to be unneeded and they began planning cutting ties. Before the massacre, Rinara's partner Viglor caught a whiff of the guild's plans and warned her. Taking the massacre as an opportunity, Rinara left the Night Masks behind and fled Westgate.

Rinara returned to her city in the {{YearlinkName|1374}} aboard the ''[[Sea Serpent]]'', the same merchant vessel that carried the adventurer who sought to uncover the secret of a ''[[cursed]]'' mask associated with the Night Masks. Rinara offered her services to the adventurer and offered them aid in setting off against her old guilt, only asking for a share of the loot collected in the process, and she implied there would be a lot of treasure. Rinara suggested they reach out to the gang that opposed the Night Masks – [[Ebon Claws]] for information about the mask, or to [[Obid Teltas]] of [[Lathander]], but she greatly disliked the second option. She eventually discovered that the Night Masks were ruled by a cabal of [[vampire]]s.

Along the way, the adventurer and Rinara were joined by the same man who almost slaughtered Rinara three years earlier – the fallen paladin Mantides. He recognized the rogue but restrained his anger towards the ex-Night Mask as Rinara was not a member of the guild anymore and was not responsible for Tasheni's death.

She eventually discovered that the Night Masks were ruled by a cabal of [[vampire]]s.
