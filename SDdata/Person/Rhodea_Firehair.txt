Rhodea Firehair was a powerful invoker living in Aluarim in Halruaa in 1367 DR.
Rhodeas personality matched her surname. Contrary to most wizards, Rhodea was often seen at the front line of any battle or conflict, fearlessly leading those around her to victory. With a wide array of destructive spells, she was truly a force to be reckoned with.
Rhodea was the only Elder on the Council of Elders (Halruaa) who never missed a call to meeting from Zalathorm Kirkson.
She took it upon herself to make sure the Royal Mint was run effectively and fairly.
During the last few months of her life, Rhodea tutored a loxo named Dauphal who approached her because she was not afraid of him. She taught him the rudiments of the Art, of which he was fascinated and awestruck.
Rhodea had a daughter that was killed a short while after Rhodeas passing.
Sometime in the early 1370s DR, Rhodea was killed at the town mint in an accident involving a dragon.
