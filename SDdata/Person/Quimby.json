        "Activities": "Quimby was a devoted gourmand, a lover of good food and lots of it, but an impatient cook. For aid in meal preparation, especially whilst studying or traveling alone, Quimby modified the ''[[unseen servant]]'' spell to create ''[[Quimby's enchanting gourmet]]''. This spell would carry out the work of cooking for him and provide him with fine meals. Later users would nickname the ''unseen servant'' created by this spell \"Quimby\" after him.<ref>",
