        "mainbody": "uimby was a mage of the city of Procampur in the Vast, who lived some time prior to the late 9 century DR.As Quimbys enchanting gourmet appears in the spellbook Jalusters Orizon, and Jaluster died at the fall of Ascalhorn (Hellgate Keep) in 882 DR, this implies that Quimby and the gourmet were in existence some time prior to that date.\nQuimby was a devoted gourmand, a lover of good food and lots of it, but an impatient cook. For aid in meal preparation, especially whilst studying or traveling alone, Quimby modified the unseen servant spell to create Quimbys enchanting gourmet. This spell would carry out the work of cooking for him and provide him with fine meals. Later users would nickname the unseen servant created by this spell \"Quimby\" after him.\nNeedless to say, he was fat."
