==Description==
Bliggerillo was a [[lightfoot halfling]] man with a light skin tone, curly head of light brown hair, and blue eyes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the threat of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Bliggerillo could often be seen arguing with [[human]] friend, [[Porter Juxon]], over the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]]'' gazette's reliability and its claims that the walls of the Gate would protect its citizens. Bliggerillo showed no confidence in the [[broadsheet]]'s propaganda, unlike his friend. He believed that the gazette's monopoly on the news in the city had became a problem.
