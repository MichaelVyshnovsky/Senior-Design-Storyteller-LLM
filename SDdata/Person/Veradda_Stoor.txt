'''Veradda Stoor''' was a famous treasure hunter in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
==History==
In the the 1480s [[DR]], Veradda was hunting treasure left in secret stores by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. Members of the Cult had hidden their treasure after they failed to summon [[Tiamat]]. Veradda had discovered the location of five such stores, in the [[Greypeak Mountains]].

In order to access these treasure stores, Veradda hired [[adventurer]]s to help her. She agreed to meet them near [[Parnast]]. Before they could arrive, Veradda was killed by [[giant]]s who also wanted the treasure. They stole her notes and pursued the caches themselves. The adventurers arrived too late to save Veradda, but they found second copies of her notes and also went treasure hunting.
