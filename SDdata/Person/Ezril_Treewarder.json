He was bald but his eyes were piercing.\nHe held a deep love of nature.\nCirca 1367 DR, Ezril administered to the Grove, a shrine dedicated to the Goddess of the Singing Waters. While he did not actually hold services, he provided advice and he aided in the care of animals and crops like, asking only that the folk of Elmwood not farm, fish, or hunt too heavily. In exchange, they provided him with food, drink, and a few luxuries for his home, a small stone cottage close to the Grove. He was often accompanied by a brown bear and a wolf.\nHe preferred to stay in the forest, with the trees and animals, and so seldom entered the village itself. When he did look for human company, he brought his bear and wolf with him, not only into Elmwood but even into the Still Waters inn.\nEzril was a powerful spiritual influence among the villagers of Elmwood. He was a good friend of Thoyana Jorgadaul and Alamarayne Moonray and the three met once a week at the Still Waters to discuss village business.\nDuring the Rage of Dragons, in Tarsakh of the , a Zhentarim contingent occupied Elmwood and Ezril lodged a number of villagers in the sacred grove. Dorn Graybrook and his companions also took refuge there to reorganize. The night after their arrival, Dorns party attacked and defeated the Zhents, freeing Elwood in the process."
