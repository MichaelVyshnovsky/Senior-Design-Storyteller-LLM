Shael was an elf who operated a clothing shop in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet in the 14 century DR.
Shael created cloaks, gloves, hats, shoes, and tunics for which he charged very little, but he usually dealt with wealthy clients. Many of Shaels clients invited him to their estates and provided him with the things he needed to live in luxury, such as Queen Amlaruil Moonflower and the Council of Matrons. 
By 1367 DR, Shael was a retired windrider and adventurer.
