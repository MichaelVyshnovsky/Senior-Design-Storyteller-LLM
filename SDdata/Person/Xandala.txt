'''Xandala''' ({{Pronounce|zon|DAH|lah|refs=}}) was a [[half-elf]] who sought out the ''[[Ring of Winter]]'' in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=ToA5e-p236>

==Personality==
Xandala craved the power of the ''Ring of Winter'' as she thought it would bring her immense power and immortality. She believed that she was destined for greatness because of her [[draconic]] ancestry.

==Activities==
Xandala sought the ''Ring of Winter'', and attempted to find it by pretending to be Artus Cimber's daughter. Feigning worry, she asked a group of adventurers to help her find him.

==Description==
Areas of Xandala's skin were covered by a thin layer of scales. These scales were a result of her draconic heritage.

==Relationships==
Xandala had befriended a [[pseudodragon]] named [[Summerwise]].
