Xandala () was a half-elf who sought out the Ring of Winter in Chult during the late 15 century DR.
Xandala craved the power of the Ring of Winter as she thought it would bring her immense power and immortality. She believed that she was destined for greatness because of her draconic ancestry.
Xandala sought the Ring of Winter, and attempted to find it by pretending to be Artus Cimbers daughter. Feigning worry, she asked a group of adventurers to help her find him.
Areas of Xandalas skin were covered by a thin layer of scales. These scales were a result of her draconic heritage.
Xandala had befriended a pseudodragon named Summerwise.
