Yu Kai was a famous mercenary and "kraken hunter" operating in Westgate in the late 15 century DR.
Yu Kai ran the boastful and colorfully named Yu Kais Kraken Exterminators, a mercenary agency that promised to protect merchant ships out of Westgates harbor from dangerous monsters of the Abolethic Sovereignty.
Yu Kai was rumored to take an interest in the movements of the city of Xxiphu.
Yu Kai worked and took meals with Sashara Keenspear, a fellow famous kraken hunter. The pair were known to inspect ships in the harbor and to eat together in the private rooms of the Shell Queen.
