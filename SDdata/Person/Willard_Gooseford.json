        "mainbody": "Willard Gooseford was a ranger who lived in the village of Snowmantle during the mid-14 century DR, having called the peaceful hamlet his home longer than anyone else.\nWillard was rather tall, at 62\" (1.9 m), and had some trembling brought upon by old age. Despite this, he maintained his clever mind well into his golden years.\nThe elderly Willard was the uncle of Lanseril Snowmantle, the famed druid of the Knights of Myth Drannor, on his human mothers side.\nFor many years, Willard operated the winery within Snowmantle, fermenting unique mushrooms from the nearby Border Forest, which he barreled and sold to nearby Dalesfolk.\nDuring the occupation of Snowmantle by Zhentilar forces after the year 1355 DR, Willard hid his keen mind and feigned a number of ailments to present himself in an entirely non-threatening manner to the Zhent slavers. When his nephew Lanseril was imprisoned within their home village, Willard took in his badger ally Lawrence, and used the particularly intelligent animal to maintain communication with his nephew.\nA month after the Zhent army and the entire village of Snowmantle was leveled by a nature elemental in 1369 DR, Willard, Juliana Saan and Walter Geddstone returned to their home in order to rebuild."
