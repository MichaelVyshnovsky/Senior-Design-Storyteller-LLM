'''Hadrar "Hawkblade" Bruynnis''' was an adventurer and mercenary that traveled [[Faerûn]] during the mid—14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime around the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], Hadrar "Hawkblade" was exploring an underground complex beneath the [[Forest of Tethir]]. While underground, Hadrar claimed that he briefly held ''[[The Argyr]]'', a [[Gond]]ar [[relic]] of tremendous importance and value.

Unfortunatley for Hawkblade, he was assailed by a group of [[wight]]s just before the subterranean ruins began to crumble around him. Although he lost the spectacular [[book|tome]] Hadrar managed to survive the collapse and live long enough to share his tale.
