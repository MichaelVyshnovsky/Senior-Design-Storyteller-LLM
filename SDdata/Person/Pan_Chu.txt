Pan Chu was the best wako admiral of Kozakura in 1357 DR.
Pan Chu, a Kozakuran of Shou ancestry, was the most feared of the wako pirate admirals. He usually took no prisoners and saved only captured ship adapted for war. His ship was the Golden Lily, a war junk with a mixed crew of wako from Kozakura, Wa, and Shou Lung. Pan Chu was very efficient in his pirate raids and nobody had yet captured him.
The Golden Lily regularly docked in Yoetsu. Captain Pan Chu and other wako captains were often be found in the sake shops and establishments along the waterfront, making them accessible for contact and business dealings.
