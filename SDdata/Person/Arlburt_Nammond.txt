'''Arlburt Nammond''' was a cobbler from [[Hultail]] in [[Cormyr]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Arlburt was a pleasant-mannered, short and rotund man with a pronounced nose and bowed legs.

==History==

He had a reputation as a hard-working man who "was stitching in his sleep." His work was sturdy but unattractive, but steadily attracted customers from all around.
