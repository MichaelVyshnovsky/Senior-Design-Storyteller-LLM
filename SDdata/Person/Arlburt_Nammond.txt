Arlburt Nammond was a cobbler from Hultail in Cormyr, active in the late 15 century DR.
Arlburt was a pleasant-mannered, short and rotund man with a pronounced nose and bowed legs.
By the late 15 century DR, Arlburt Nammond worked out of his shop on Bell Lane of Hultail repairing clothing, belts, baldrics, also selling and repairing footwear and boots of his own making. He had a reputation as a hard-working man who "was stitching in his sleep." His work was sturdy but unattractive, but steadily attracted customers from all around.
