'''Kurthe Lornar''' was a slave turned pirate who was a loyal crew-member of the ''[[Kissing Shark]]'' helmed by [[Blackfingers Ralingor]] ''circa'' [[1371 DR]].

==Description==
Kurthe was a big, very tall, heavily muscled [[human]] Konigheimer.

==Personality==
Like many other escaped slaves, Kurthe had a hot temper. He often acted aggressively even towards his fellow crew members. Most people who interacted with him noticed his constantly scowling face.

==Abilities==
Kurthe was a competent pirate who could easily use improvised weapons and daggers. He preferred direct approach to combat that lacked finesse. He often lost his cool in combat and fell into uncontrollable rage.

==Relationships==
After the ''Kissing Shark'' was destroyed, Kurthe Lornar became the de facto leader of the surviving Sharkers.

The only person who he was affectionate with was his fellow crew-member [[Sharessa Stagwood|Sharessa "The Shadow" Stagwood]].

Even after his old captain's, Blackfingers Ralingor's death, Kurthe remained passionately loyal to him, to a fault.

==History==
The ''Kissing Shark'' was not the first ship Kurthe sailed with, the firs one was attacked and burnt down by [[Doegan Dogs]] in [[Port Halovar]].

Sometime in [[1371 DR]], the pirate ship of ''Kissing Shark'' was destroyed in a blast of [[smoke powder]]. The captain of the ship Blackfingers Ralingor perished and only seven of the Sharkers survived. The ex-slave from [[Konigheim]],  Kurthe "Longshanks" Lornar was one of them. Together the Sharkers saved one chest off the ''Kissing Shark''. Later, the group found themselves in the tavern of [[Donder's Dancing Masques]] in [[Tharkar]]. There a mysterious benefactor named [[Belmer Droon]] rescued them from one of the frequent bar fights, and help the Sharkers avoiding the brutal law enforcement of the [[Daggers of Tharkar]].

Once the Sharkers and their savior reached the safety of [[Ankle Bells]], Belmer revealed his agenda, he were too pay generously to a group of mercenaries to perform a mission in the capital of [[Doegan]]. After the pirates agreed, Belmer had their writs signed and they embarked on a mission to find and assassinate a noblewoman, [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]].

Under the cover of night, in secrecy, the group boarded the ship ''Morning Bird''. Soon after the ship left the port, it came under an attack from an unknown black ship that bombarded the ''Bird'' with [[fire pot missile]]s and terrifying ''[[bone ball]]''s that melted away in the flames revealing dancing floating armed [[skeleton]]s. The Sharkers and their benefactors managed to fight off the undead and evaded the black ship with the aid of Balmer's ''[[box of mists]]'' and a ''[[prayer-token of Umberlee]]''. The ''box'' transported ship into a different part of the sea away from the pursuit, but the ''prayer token'' of the fickle goddess summoned her servants on board of the ''ghost ship''. The ship spawned the dreaded [[sea zombie]]s and the crew of ''Morning Bird'' had to appease [[Umberlee]] by tossing their valuables overboard.

During the short respite, the suspicious employer mixed an exotic drug [[yulchass powder]] in with the crew's food. The powder has a side effect of making its imbibers truthful. This made the Konigheimer even more suspicious of their boss, even though Belmer had good reasons. The ship followed them, somehow tracking them. After a long search, the Sharkers and  Belmer found a magical ''[[scrying]]'' device hidden on the bottom on the Sharker' chest..

Soon after, the mysterious black ship, now identified as the ''[[Black Dragon (ship)|Black Dragon]]'', caught up with the ''Morning Bird''. The pursuing captain was the infamous [[Orim Redbeard]], the pirate responsible for the death of Blackfingers Ralingor. Kruthe's short temper and rabid devotion to his old captain pushed him to attempt to attack Redbeard. Belmer knowing to expect it hit the tall Konigheimer over the head knocking him out. Orim Redbeard realized that he pursued the wrong ship, and left the Sharkers in peace. Meanwhile, Kurthe Lornar came back to his senses, fuming with rage over the what he perceived as betrayal. He attacked the benefactor in blind rage, while his fellow Sharkers stayed out of combat. Belmer showed uncanny skill and finesse avoiding Kurthe's brute attacks. Giving the hotheaded pirates plenty of warnings, Belmer continued leaving cuts and slices on Konigheimer's body. The pirate never stood down and died soaked in his own blood with Belmer's dagger in his neck..
