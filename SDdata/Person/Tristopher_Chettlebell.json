While Tristopher escaped to safety, Lady Monini was not so fortunate and needed to be rescued by the adventurer. The information that Tristopher uncovered proved very useful to the [[Harper]] agent [[Windle]], in her group's efforts to thwart the activities of the cult and stop the machinations of the malevolent [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]."
