King Ornoth Myrmoran I was the ruler of Uthtower from 168 DR to 191 DR.
Ornoths father was King Uth I. He had twin sons, Ornoth II and Uth II.
Ornoth became king after the death of his father, Uth I. He granted nobility to seven of his closest allies, who had long been his councillors. This core of noble houses made up the Council of Lords of Uthtower, and the leader of each house occupied one seat on the council.
Ornoth died suddenly in 191 DR, leaving a dispute between his twin sons as to who would claim the throne. The Council of Lords of Uthtower decreed that Prince Uth II would rule Uthtower itself and Prince Ornoth II would rule a newly created kingdom named Yarlith to the north of Uthtower. The Mage Royal of Uthtower, Iniarv, crafted the Twin Crowns of Myrmoran to aid in their rule and mutual fellowship. The brothers reined peacefully until their deaths in 272 DR.
King Ornoth Is and Queen Mihaths crypts were located below the ruins of the Uthtower in the Mere of Dead Men.
