Karl, commonly known as Dumb Karl, was a dwarf farmer in the Moonsea in the late 15 century DR.
Karl was a homely individual but despite his appearance and nickname he was actually quite bright.
Karl was a hill dwarf farmer who produced a lot of the grain delivered to Hillsfar.
Circa 1486 DR, his business declined because the Merchants Guild of Hillsfar started to boycott non-human farmers. Worse still, some Red Plumes decided to make money kidnapping farmers around the city and selling them to duergar slavers.
In response, Karl joined a bandit group in order to attack a caravan protected by corrupt Red Plumes led by Reginald.
