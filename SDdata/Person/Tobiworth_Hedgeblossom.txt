Tobiworth Hedgeblossom was one of the leaders of the Social Justice League, one of the  factions active in the city of Zazesspur during the Tethyrian Interregnum period.
Tobiworth was a diminutive halfling, but&mdashalthough his voice was high-pitched&mdashhe spoke with great authority. He was called Toby by his followers.
