==Description==
Tobiworth was a diminutive [[halfling]], but&mdash;although his voice was high-pitched&mdash;he spoke with great authority. He was called Toby by his followers.

==Activities==
Toby spent a large amount of his time preaching through a [[speaking-tube]] from the streets of Zazesspur a message that the rich were responsible for the troubles affecting [[Tethyr]].

==Relationships==
Toby had a brother named [[Putomas Hedgeblossom|Putomas]], or Poot. Together, the two were known as the Hedgeblossom brothers and led the Social Justice League.

The League was strongly opposed to the [[Hairheads]], another major faction in Zazesspur the time, because that group preached violence against non[[human]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, when Zaranda Star visited her friend [[Artalos]] the [[:Category:Armorers|armorer]] in Zazesspur, she heard Toby give a speech on one occasion
