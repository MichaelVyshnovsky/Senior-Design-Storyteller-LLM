The Gentle Ghost of Silverymoon was a flying ghostly, sentient apparition which first appeared in Silverymoon around 1459 DR.  The identity of the ghost in life was unknown but many wild theories abounded.  
The ghost occasionally swooped down and passed through observers who often collapsed but were unharmed other than reporting an intense chill.  Those touched by the ghost received a vision of a location, sometimes one within the city walls.  A few of the locations were explored by her "victims" and found to contain treasure caches.  
The Gentle Ghost appeared as an eladrin woman, bluish-white in color.  She wore a cloak and robes and was more solid looking from the waist up.  She always floated several feet above the ground.
