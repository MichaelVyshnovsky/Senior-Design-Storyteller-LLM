Falias Emberthumb was a halfling merchant who sold mundane goods, cloth, and dresses from Waterdeep in the city of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.
Falias Emberthumb was a portly halfling with a bold head, crow-like nose, dandy grommet mustache, and a small beard.
He was a nervous fellow who often sweated profusely when stressed, wrangling his hands. He was very polite and proper, and bowed according to customs even when interacting with his own employees.
Falias Emberthumbs regular caravan consisted of three wagons drawn by six oxen.
In 1372 DR, Falias Emberthumb hired mercenaries to accompany his caravan from Waterdeep to Daggerford, a shipment of ladies gowns. One of the hirelings was an experienced fighter, Talarenne, and the other would later become the hero of Daggerford, and another. They traveled along the Trade Way until the caravan was stopped by a recently fallen tree. This was a scene of an ambush by a group of mysterious bandits (in reality, Zhentarim agents). As the attackers were defeated, Falias assumed the attacks be simple foolish robbers who foolishly attacked a shipment of clothes.
Reaching the safety of Daggerfords walls, Falias made sure his surviving injured guard received the best care. The halfling merchant felt honor-bound to offer the hero of Daggerford one of his best dresses as a reward for the job well done, and opened up a stall in the citys marketplace, not far from the Daggerford Castle.
