        "mainbody": "'''Krin Foxrun''' was a [[sorcerer]] who lived at [[Fourstaves House]] in [[Yhaunn]] with the Thingoleir family during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Personality": "Krin was brash and daring in his youth, though he was more temperate with age.",
        "Abilities": "Krin was a talented and sorcerer. Unlike his wife's family, he used [[wand]]s to cast his spells and didn't use a staff.",
        "Relationships": "Krin managed to impress [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and [[Dagnalla Irongard]] with his boldness and love of Malia, and was welcomed into their home.\n\nHe was happily married to [[Malia Thingoleir]] and a loving father to [[Adrey Foxrun]], though he was unable to help teach her magic as she had a [[wizard]]'s aptitude.",
        "History": "As a young man, he developed his innate magical talent and enjoyed causing problems with it. He came across the [[Thingoleir]] family as they travelled in the [[Dalelands]], and he immediately fell in love with Malia. He eventually proved his worth by dueling another mage in [[Selgaunt]] to defend her honor, and joined her family at Fourstaves House.\n\nIn [[Eleasis]] of [[1373 DR]], he helped the Thingoleir family study the ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''. The same month, he joined them in defending the [[Stiltways]] from [[Variance Amatick]]'s pack of [[shadow mastiff]]s."
