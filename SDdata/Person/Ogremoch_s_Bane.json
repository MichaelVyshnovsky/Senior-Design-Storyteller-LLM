        "mainbody": "gremochs Bane was a cloud of evil, sentient, invisible magical dust that dwelled in the deep gnome city of Blingdenstone in the Northdark in the 14 and 15 centuries DR. It was named after the lord of evil earth elementals, to contrast it with the presence of Entemochs Boon in the city.\nAs it drifting around the city, any creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth that it came into contact with were freed of any magical control. Moreover, if they were not of good nature, then they were driven into a violent destructive rage. The deep gnomes could not reverse the effects nor banish the earth creatures back to their home plane, so they had to destroy them in order to get rid of them.\nAfter the fall of the city and its abandonment by the gnomes, however, the cloud changed tack. Instead, it collected more and more earth creatures and outsiders, with dozens of earth elementals, xorns, mephits, thoqquas, and others. Rather than making them rage, it had them stand still as statues in the dark rear caverns that housed the city, while it hovered around and whispered words in Terran promising victory and glory for some unknown purpose.\nIt first appeared in Blingdenstone around 1358 DR. The reason for its occurrence was unknown, but elder deep gnome priests theorized that the clouds presence was somehow tied to that of Entemochs Boon.\nDuring the drow attack of the , the cloud diverted quite a few of the svirfneblins extraplanar allies from the defense of the city. It kept them as part of its stored army, but summoned and captured a few others in the years after.\nIn the  a pech named Gallus identified Ogremochs Bane as an atypical earth elemental.\nIn the late 15 century DR, it was confirmed to be a native of the Elemental Planes and was sent back by a party of adventurers escaping from drow slavers of Velkynvelve hired by some deep gnome factions."
