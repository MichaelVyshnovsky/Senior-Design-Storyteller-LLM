'''Nerozar the Defeated''' was a [[beholder]] [[zombie]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Activities==
Nerozar was floating together with three [[gas spore]]s in a cave inside the [[Sargauth Level]].

==History==
When it was alive, Nerozar challenged the [[Xanathar]] for lordship over [[Skullport]] but lost and was killed. Later, as a [[zombie]], it became a pet of the [[mind flayer]] ambassador of Skullport.

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the mind flayer ambassador took Nerozar with it during the visit to the [[hobgoblin]] warlord [[Azrok]]. However, Azrok disliked the zombie and the ambassador decided to leave Nerozar in a cave.
