        "mainbody": "he Alchemist was a green slaad posing as a human man in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.\nThe Alchemist settled in a cavern in the Twisted Caverns. It sold potions to travelers, but in truth it was searching for its control gem. If questioned about itself, it said it had been kidnapped by the Mad Mage from a place he couldnt remember.\nIn 1491 DR, Halaster summoned a green slaad, deprived it of its control gem, and set it loose inside Undermoutain. The slaad wandered many dungeon levels in search of its gem until it sensed the gem somewhere inside the Twisted Caverns. So it disguised itself as a human alchemist and started selling potions to travelers.\nThe Alchemist only wanted to get back its gem and go back to home. However, in fear of being controlled, it asked nobody for help to find it. As a human alchemist, he could not explain the reason Halaster had kidnapped him.\nJibber-Jabber was friend of the Alchemist, who provided the ettin with a potion that transformed the water in barrelstalk mushrooms into mead."
