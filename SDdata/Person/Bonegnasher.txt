'''Bonegnasher''' was the [[ogre]] leader of a group of bandits and slavers who occupied the [[Tomb of Damara]] in the forests outside of the villages of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] and [[Freedale]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Silence! Who dares disturb Bonegnasher the Ogre's den of death and destruction—a bunch of puny [[human]]s? Destroy them, [[Predator (wolf)|Predator]]! Devour them, [[Crusher (wolf)|Crusher]]! Rip 'em to pieces! It's chow time!"''|Bonegnasher}}

==Description==
Bonegnasher was a mountain of a man who reached {{SI|9'|'"|long=yes}}. He was not particularly bright, and ruled by instilling fear into the [[humanoids]] in his marauding band.

==Possessions==
During the time Bonegnasher was holding the castle of the long-dead [[wizard]] Lord [[Damara (wizard)|Damara]], he managed to scavenge some minor [[magical item]]s, most of which he stashed in the castle's sub level, guarded by a hungry [[carrion crawler]]. Among the treasure trove were [[gold]] and [[silver]] coins, a ''[[spellbook]]'' that was taken from [[Taran Goldenstar]], an enchanted ''+1'' [[longsword]], ''+2'' magical [[chainmail]], a masterfully crafted ''+1 [[shield]]'', a ''[[potion of healing]]'', and a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''.

On his person, the ogre had a giant-sized [[club]] which he used in combat, a magical ''+1 [[dagger]]'' and ''+2 [[short sword]]'', some loose [[gem]]stones, and two [[scroll]]s of ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[charm person]]''. His loyal trained [[wolf|wolves]] Crusher and Predator were always around, ready to defend their master.

==History==
During the the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], Bonegnasher stumbled upon knowledge of a powerful [[artifact]], an ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'' hidden somewhere deep inside the long ruined and abandoned castle of a once-powerful do-gooder wizard. The ogre led a group of marauders to take over the castle. They stayed for years searching for the lost artifact and capturing slaves. Bonegnasher's bandit band consisted of several cowardly [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s, several [[hobgoblin]]s, [[orc]]s, [[gnoll]]s,, and a [[lizard man]] [[cleric]] of [[Semuanya]]. At various points in time, the marauders captured villages and travelers and used them as slaves within the castle walls, one of whom was Taran Goldenstar, an apprentice of Freedale's sage.

Capturing Taran ended up being the act that sealed the ogre's fate. The wizard [[Netheril (wizard)|Netheril]] hired a group of local adventurers to find the missing apprentice and help Taran recover the dangerous ''orb''. The heroes were able to defeat the marauders and killed Bonegnasher and his pets. The heroes freed the captured slaves and Taran and recovered the hidden ''orb of dragonkind''.

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors and hearsay obfuscated the history of the Tomb of Damara and Bonegnasher. Some claimed that the ogre and his forces attacked the castle and killed its inhabitants, which was false, as Damara was not killed in battle but mummified and interred. in the ruins looking for the ''orb''.
