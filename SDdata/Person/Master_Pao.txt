'''Master Pao''' was a [[Lesser Immortal]] of the [[Celestial Empire]]. Pao dwelled on [[Mount Yei]] in the [[Spirit World]].<ref group="note">The location of Mount Yei is unknown. It assumed to lie in the Spirit World because of the association with the Celestial Empire.

According to tradition, in ancient times, during the Age of Red Earth, Master Pao crafted the ''[[Ivory Chain of Pao]]''. It was gifted to the [[Nine Immortals|Nine Emperors]] as a symbol of their unity and the harmony of the peoples of the empire they ruled jointly.
