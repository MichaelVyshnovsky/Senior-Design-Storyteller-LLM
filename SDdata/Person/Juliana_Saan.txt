Juliana Saan was a young ranger and tavern owner inhabiting Snowmantle in Daggerdale during the  mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She stood  tall. Many considered her to be an attractive woman.
Juliana was brave but a bit naive.
Circa 1369 DR, Juliana inherited the Singing Dryad tavern when her father was slain by Zhentilar soldiers when they first occupied the town. Slaves under the command of the Zhentarim wizard Ragnoth were assigned to help her run the tavern since it was used as a mess hall by the Zhentilar.
She did her best to smuggle extra food and water to the slaves, but was under the watchful eye of a Banite priest named Noth.
She carried a longsword, dagger, and quarterstaff.
