        "mainbody": "'''Burlen''' was a warrior from [[Vaasa]] that traveled alongside [[Vala Thorsdotter]] and a few others on an important journey to the depths beneath [[Evereska]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Like the other Vaasan warriors that were honored to carry out their mission in the west, Burlen was the proud owner of a ''[[darksword]]''. Each of these blades possessed a unique quirk; Burlen's sword hummed while he was engaged in combat.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Burlen accompanied Vala and others of her company to hold up the bargain of [[Bodvar the Black]]. They traveled all the way from Vaasa to the [[Shaeradim]] in [[Western Heartlands]]. Together they delved into the crypts of [[House Vyshaan]] near the [[Sharn Wall]],\n\nAfter Vala and her new traveling companions entered into the returned [[Netherese enclave|Netherese city]] of [[Thultanthar]] the [[1372 DR|following year]], Burlen and the other Vaasan warriors remained in Evereska. They helped defend the city against the [[phaerimm]], fighting alongside [[Keya Nihmedu]] and the elven [[Company of the Cold Hand]] in skirmishes across the [[Vine Vale]]. \n\nDuring the battle on [[Mirtul 20]], Burlen and his fellow Vaasan warriors suffered grievous wounds. Both he and [[Kuhl]] were reassigned to escort [[Khelben Arunsun]]. Within a few days, Khelben, the Vaasans and the rest of Evereska's defenders were united with [[Laeral Silverhand]] and the [[Army of the North]]. Unfortunately, they were all abandoned and betrayed by the [[Shadovar]]. Burlen himself was somehow compelled to attack Lady Silverhand with his ''[[darksword]]'', severing her arm below the elbow. Fortunately for Laeral, Burlen was knocked out cold by Kuhl and they were all transported to safety."
