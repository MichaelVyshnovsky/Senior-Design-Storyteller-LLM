        "History": "Some time during the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the Moss family farm was attacked by goblins from the [[Foulwater]] tribe and only Millivent and Bo managed to escape. While it was not entirely clear exactly what happened to Haldred and the rest of the children, it appeared as if they were taken captive rather than killed outright."
