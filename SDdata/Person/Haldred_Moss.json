        "mainbody": "aldred Moss was a peat farmer that lived on a farm in the Twilight Marsh of the Moonsea North during the late 15 century DR.\nHe was married to his intrepid wife named Millivent, and together they had four children daughters Alleena and Kithian, sons Quayle and Volland, and an infant named Bo.\nSome time during the 1480s DR, the Moss family farm was attacked by goblins from the Foulwater tribe and only Millivent and Bo managed to escape. While it was not entirely clear exactly what happened to Haldred and the rest of the children, it appeared as if they were taken captive rather than killed outright."
