'''Zilvreen''' was one of the [[Wearers of Purple]] in the [[Cult of the Dragon]], their master thief member of the council of their [[Sembia]]n cell. He usually resided in [[Saerloon]].

==Relationships==
Zilvreen trusted [[Maenoth Silversword]] as much as he trusted anyone.{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|57}} [[Malark Himbruel]] seemed to resent and mistrust him.

==History==
Zilvreen was one of the leaders who ordered the hunt for [[Shandril Shessair]] in [[1357 DR]]. He was later in favor of abandoning the search for spellfire.The scene is ommited from the 2005 rewrite.

By {{yearlink|1368}}, Zilvreen may have suspected Maenoth's true allegiance and taken steps to rid himself of the [[Harper]].{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|116}}
