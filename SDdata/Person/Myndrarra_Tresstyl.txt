Myndrarra Tresstyl was a famous dancer, prostitute, and mystic in the 14 century DR.
Originally working as a tavern dancer and prostitute, Myndrarras life changed when she wrote Swordstar, a book purported to contain mystical guidance and fortune-telling secrets. This turned to widespread fame when various churches attempted to suppress her work, only resulting in it becoming a hotly desired piece of mysticism that quickly became widespread across Faer√ªn. She continued to work as a prostitute in her old age, as customers came to her to hear her gasp out cryptic phrases that revealed secret truths about their lives ahead.
