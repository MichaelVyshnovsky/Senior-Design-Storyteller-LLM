Ramarthant Horaerays was a mage of the late 15 century DR and the Magister during the turn of the century.
He was quiet and thoughtful.
Ramarthant had mastered his trove of enchanted devices sufficiently to become a powerhouse of magic. One unique spell of his allowed him to transport beholders from elsewhere to other places as he pleased.
Ramarthant had acquired a significant cache of Netherese enchanted devices.
Before becoming the Magister, Valargrim Hond had been an adventurer for three decades, through which he had amassed a small hoard of enchanted items. In the , with Mystras blessing, Azuth offered the office of Magister to Ramarthant Horaerays upon the death of Valargrim Hond.
Upon receiving the mantle of office, he was immediately set upon by sixteen liches sent by Szass Tam, and defeated all of them. He then retaliated by magically sending several Zhentarim beholders straight into Thaymount, where they caused great chaos. No further attempts from Szass Tam were known.
He since disappeared into a number of lairs across Faer√ªn. Of note, hed defeated a young arcanist from Thultanthar whod tried to seize the Magisters cache to grow mightier.
Ramarthant had not faced many challenges, because he was difficult to find. He spent most of his time modifying magic and devices he owned, to better defend himself with.
