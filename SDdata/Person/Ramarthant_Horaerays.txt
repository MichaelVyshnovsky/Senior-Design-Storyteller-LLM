'''Ramarthant Horaerays''' was a mage of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and the [[Magister]] during the turn of the century.

==Personality==
He was quiet and thoughtful.

==Abilities==
Ramarthant had mastered his trove of enchanted devices sufficiently to become a powerhouse of magic. One unique spell of his allowed him to transport [[beholder]]s from elsewhere to other places as he pleased.

==Possessions==
Ramarthant had acquired a significant cache of [[Netherese]] [[enchanted]] devices.

==History==
Before becoming the Magister, Valargrim Hond had been an [[adventurer]] for three decades, through which he had amassed a small hoard of enchanted items. In the {{yearlinkName|1496}}, with [[Mystra]]'s blessing, [[Azuth]] offered the office of Magister to Ramarthant Horaerays upon the death of [[Valargrim Hond]].

Upon receiving the mantle of office, he was immediately set upon by sixteen [[lich]]es sent by [[Szass Tam]], and defeated all of them. He then retaliated by magically sending several [[Zhentarim]] beholders straight into [[Thaymount]], where they caused great chaos. No further attempts from Szass Tam were known.

He since disappeared into a number of lairs across [[Faer√ªn]]. Of note, he'd defeated a young arcanist from [[Thultanthar]] who'd tried to seize the Magister's cache to grow mightier.

==Activities==
Ramarthant had not faced many challenges, because he was difficult to find. He spent most of his time modifying magic and devices he owned, to better defend himself with.
