'''Cassra Brandywine ''' was the head scribe of [[Mantor's Library]] in [[Phlan]] in [[1489 DR]].

==Personality==
Cassra was a young but very smart woman. She was very busy and had no time for socializing. Thus Cassra became clumsy and socially awkward, often stammering when in front of more than two people.

==Activities==
Cassra was the Scribe Master of Mantor's Library, the second-in-command of the [[Lord Sage of Phlan]]. 

==History==
In 1489 DR, she was involved in a case of stolen books, as one of the books was originally from the Library.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|8}}
