'''Ottolenszillasla''', or '''Otto''' for short, was a violet [[faerie dragon]] living in [[Maddgoth's Castle]] in [[Undermountain]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
Around [[1483 DR]], Otto was drawn into Undermountain by [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s magic, together with a [[stone giant]] clan. He enjoyed his new home, especially Maddgoth's Castle, whose magic did not affect the dragon. So Otto decided to settle there playing with the stone giants.

By [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Otto was growing tired of the presence of [[Maddgoth]]'s [[homunculus]] and started make plans to remove it.

==Personality==
Otto was a typical faerie dragon.

==Activities==
When bored, Otto played pranks on the nearby stone giants or fought with Maddgoth's homunculus as it annoyed him.
