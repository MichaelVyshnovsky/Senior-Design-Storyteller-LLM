He took the throne in the [[802 DR|Year of the Patchworked Peace]].\n\nLegends say that when King Strohm V died, he changed into an oak tree. Since he had no sons, the [[Strohm Dynasty]] was ended. [[Tibor Mallorhen]], the husband of Strohm's oldest daughter became the first ruler of the short-lived [[Mallorhen Dynasty]]. Following the death of the second Mallorhen king, Tethyr would be ruled by four of Strohm V's female descendants, a period of time known as the [[Queens' Dynasty|Queens' Era]]."
