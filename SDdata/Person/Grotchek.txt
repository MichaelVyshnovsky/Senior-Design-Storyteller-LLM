Grotchek was the kobold "king" of a small tribe from Undermountain that raided streets of Waterdeep midâ€“14 century DR.
Grotchek considered himself to be the greatest of the kobolds, but when confronted with creatures bigger and stronger than him, he groveled in submission and fear.
Sometime in early 1370 DR, Grotcheks kobold tribe was forced out of the territory that was their home. Under the "king" Grotcheks leadership, the tribe settled in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. On the 15 of Eleasias of that year, the "king" was contacted by the villainous drow High Priestess of Lolth Azurna that intimidated Grotchek into servitude. Under the drow orders, the kobolds were forced to venture into the streets of Waterdeep.  Under the cover of the night, kobolds raided and thieved from the Lords of Waterdeep. Azurna ordered the stolen goods to be exchanged for food for the tribe via the grey orc trader Horazak that was allied with the drow. Another function that Grotcheks tribe was to serve - gatekeeping of the entrance to Undermountain from the Yavninv Portal, killing and capturing anyone who descended into the dungeon, and sending runner messengers to the drow in case the Lords agents were to enter the dungeon.
Of course, the kobold activities attracted the City of Splendors authorities  attention. Khelben Arunsun tasked a capable adventurer with the investigation of the kobold activity that, in his opinion, originated from the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. The hero was able to defeat many members of Grotcheks tribe. Once the hero reached the kobold "king"s throne room in the ancient flooded sewers, Grotchek groveled and begged for his life, promising to cease the raids and letting the hero have Azurnas letter to shift the blame from himself to the drow.
