'''Reevor''' was a guard in [[Candlekeep]] who watched over the store-houses during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was aided in his duties by a small army of ever-vigilant cats.

==History==
Reevor occasionally enlisted [[Gorion's Ward]] to assist with clearing the storage rooms of rats, especially when the feline soldiers of Candlekeep were not up to the duty.
