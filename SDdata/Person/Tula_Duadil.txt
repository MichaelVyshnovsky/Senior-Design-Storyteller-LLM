Tula Duadil was an aquatic elf thief in Myth Nantar.
Tula, a cousin of the ruler of Naramyr, went to the city in order to become a dukar but was rejected for her power-hungry attitude. Tula wanted revenge, so attempted to insinuate herself into the circles surrounding the Nantarn Council.
Tula was a spoiled girl who ruthlessly searched for power.
