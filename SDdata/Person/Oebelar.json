        "mainbody": "he Oebelar was formerly a mage in the city of Scornubel.\nOne night around 1338 DR, his tower was struck by blue-white cold fire and destroyed, but the next night, one of his eyeballs and a blackened forearm appeared. Thereafter, they wandered the city either together or independently. The hand was both able to write and make gestures. Ballads were written about the remnants of the Oebelar, and more than one adventuring band has chosen the name the Eye and the Hand. Most citizens hated the floating eye and forearm but even the most powerful magic seemed to have no effect on them. They could, however, be harmed by regular weapons."
