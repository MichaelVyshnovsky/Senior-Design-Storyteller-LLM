        "mainbody": "'''Mroarild Sarvarada''' was a traveling merchant, performer, gemcutter, [[hedge wizard]], and the adoptive mother of [[Taline Telgara]] around the turn of the 10{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "As a merchant, she sold minor articles of clothing and jewelry; his routine performanced included juggling, dancing, acrobatics, and short comedy stints with her husband. They adopted [[Taline Telgara]], an orphan from near [[Everlund]], whose family had been killed in an [[orc]]ish raid; she soon joined their performances. By Taline's second season as a performer, both Nanath and her husband were adamant they only perform as a family, never alone. She was a hedge wizard in addition to her other talents, and she taught Taline what little magic she knew early on. Eventually Nanath retired from the road, and became a gemcutter for a coster based in [[Athkatla]], together with her husband, [[Mroarild Sarvarada]]."
