        "History": "He spent some time in the town of [[Sambryntyn]] in [[Turmish]], disguised as a female [[human]] barmaid named \"Liliatha,\" and working at [[The Adept's Choice]] tavern. When called into the service of Azuth, Adamarondor left town, but not before informing the tavern's patrons about a key that would lead them to his hoard. Though they initially dismissed it as a tall tale, several townspeople unsuccessfully searched for the hoard. Unfortunately, the key ended up lost in a stream following a fight."
