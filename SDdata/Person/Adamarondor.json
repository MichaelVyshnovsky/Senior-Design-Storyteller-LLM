        "mainbody": "Adamarondor was an ancient gold dragon who served as the steed and messenger of the Magister at Azuths behest.\nHe spent some time in the town of Sambryntyn in Turmish, disguised as a female human barmaid named \"Liliatha,\" and working at The Adepts Choice tavern. When called into the service of Azuth, Adamarondor left town, but not before informing the taverns patrons about a key that would lead them to his hoard. Though they initially dismissed it as a tall tale, several townspeople unsuccessfully searched for the hoard. Unfortunately, the key ended up lost in a stream following a fight."
