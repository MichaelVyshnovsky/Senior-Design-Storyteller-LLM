        "History": "By [[1479 DR]], Storborn Stonefist was known for his mulish work ethics and confidence in his way of crafting [[armor]]. None could change Storborn's mind or opinion. However, the fact that he was not bad at his job was a major redeeming quality. He made a living by selling his armorer services to the [[adventurer]]s and defenders of [[Neverwinter]]."
