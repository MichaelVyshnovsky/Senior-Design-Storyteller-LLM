        "mainbody": "torborn Stonefist was a stubborn dwarvish armorer-for-hire from the city of Neverwinter, active in the late 15 century DR.\nBy 1479 DR, Storborn Stonefist was known for his mulish work ethics and confidence in his way of crafting armor. None could change Storborns mind or opinion. However, the fact that he was not bad at his job was a major redeeming quality. He made a living by selling his armorer services to the adventurers and defenders of Neverwinter."
