'''Alastar Bol''' ({{Pronounce|AL|a|star|_|BOWL|refs={{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|3}}}}) was the highest-ranked member of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] stationed at [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|33}}{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|48}} He was known as '''the Fat Knight'''{{Cite adventurers league/A Lesson in Love|4}} and he also styled himself "the Scourge of the Unliving in Chult".{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|33}}

==Description==
Alastar wore fine clothes and was balding. While in Chult, Alastar had gained a significant amount of weight and a tan. He also sweated profusely. 

He had once been a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]]{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|15}}

==Personality==
{{Fq
| text = Fetch me that pitcher of cool water, please.
| source =  Alastar Bol
}}
Alastar was very intelligent and wise. He frequently gave advice and expected it to be followed, else he grew irritated.{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|4}}

He was ill-suited to the Chultan climate and hated his posting there, which he found to be hot and boring, and so he often complained and wanted to receive a promotion with a posting to a different location. He had a habit of over-eating, especially out of boredom.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|21}} He enjoyed sweets, and would use them instead of miniatures when planning tactics on his [[map]]s.

==Activities==
Alastar had been sent to Port Nyanzaru by the Order of the Gauntlet but he rarely left his luxurious and well-guarded villa in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]], which was close to the [[Hall of Gold]] at the top of [[Mount Sibasa]], overlooking the [[fish market (Port Nyanzaru)|fish market]] to the southwest. He was known to host lavish feasts. 

Virtually everything he did was with the hope that it would make a good enough impression on his superiors to allow him to leave Chult. To aid in the fight against the [[undead]] that rampaged through the jungle, we was known to distribute ''[[holy water]]'' to Order agents heading into the jungle.

He was known to bet on [[dinosaur]] races in Port Nyanzaru, and his favorite racer was [[Mountain Thunder]]. On especially hot days, he did not bother to attend races in person, and instead sent his agents to place bets on his behalf.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|3}}

==Relationships==
Alastor had a number of subordinates, which included [[Derio]], [[Radwan Goldlust]], and [[Gordo|Gordo the Just]].

He occasionally cooperated with representatives from other factions within Port Nyanzaru, such as when several of them elected to hire the mercenary [[Pozzanna Lordeaux]] to secure a stronghold within the Chultan jungle{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|4}} or when they rallied behind [[Hawkdriver Mazugulak]] to drive back an undead attack on the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Rotting Roots|3}} 

He was an ally to the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]]s, notably [[Ekene-Afa]]{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|24}} and [[Kwayothé]].

==History==
{{Fq
| text = The Order of the Gauntlet has tried many times to establish a base in this land. Our first attempt failed at Camp Righteous. Our second attempt at Camp Vengeance is barely surviving. In both cases, the undead presence has been too great.

Alastar was sent to Chult not by his own request, but by the machinations of one of his enemies within the Order of the Gauntlet. As of the events of the [[death curse]] around {{Yearlink|1490}},{{ToA-time}} he was in his late 30s, had retired from the [[church of Waukeen]], and had already witnessed the Order's efforts to establish itself in Chult flounder, first at [[Camp Righteous]] and increasingly at [[Camp Vengeance]]. During this time, he sent Derio to investigate disappearances in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]] connected to [[Viplo]]'s [[necromantic]] scheming while he was under the power of a piece of the ''[[Dreamer's Amulet]]''.

When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the [[fiend]]ish forces of [[Idrianne Smoke]], Alastar saw the crisis as yet another opportunity to prove his worthiness of being transferred somewhere cooler than Chult. The merchant prince [[Kwayothé]] enlisted his and the Order's assistance during the siege.

Following the end of the death curse, Alastar brought together several factions within Port Nyanzaru in order to send [[adventurer]]s to investigate undead forces stemming from the ancient city of [[Matolo]].{{Cite adventurers league/Putting the Dead to Rest|5}}

After someone used [[magic]] to impersonate him and gain access to Order resources, Alastar sought agents who could help unmask whoever it had been. Given [[Radwan Goldlust|the culprit's]] apparent familiarity with the Order's inner workings, he suspected it to be a traitor within his faction.
