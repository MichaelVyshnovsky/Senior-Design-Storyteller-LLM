'''Sylkress Auvryndar''' was a [[drow]] member of [[House Auvryndar (Menzoberranzan)|House Auvryndar]] in the drow settlement in the [[Sargauth Level]] in [[Undermountain]] in the early 1490s [[DR]].

==Personality==
If in fear for her life, Sylkress could divulge precious information to her assailants.

==History==
Sylkress was a priestess of [[Lolth]] and a daughter of Matron Mother [[Vlonwelv Auvryndar]].

In [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Sylkress believed her lover [[Narizmar Do'ett]] had betrayed her by swearing loyalty to another female and decided to torture him to find out who. (In truth, it was Narizmar himself who had spread the rumor to prove his loyalty to Sylkress under torture.)

==Relationship==
Sylkress was in love with Narizmar. She had a twin sister, [[Melith Auvryndar]], currently in the [[Twisted Caverns]].

==Activities==
Sylkress kept herself busy with the water torture of her former lover Narizmar. The two of them enjoyed this.
