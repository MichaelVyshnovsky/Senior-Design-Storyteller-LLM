Sylkress Auvryndar was a drow member of House Auvryndar in the drow settlement in the Sargauth Level in Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
If in fear for her life, Sylkress could divulge precious information to her assailants.
Sylkress was a priestess of Lolth and a daughter of Matron Mother Vlonwelv Auvryndar.
In 1492 DR, Sylkress believed her lover Narizmar Doett had betrayed her by swearing loyalty to another female and decided to torture him to find out who. (In truth, it was Narizmar himself who had spread the rumor to prove his loyalty to Sylkress under torture.)
Sylkress was in love with Narizmar. She had a twin sister, Melith Auvryndar, currently in the Twisted Caverns.
Sylkress kept herself busy with the water torture of her former lover Narizmar. The two of them enjoyed this.
