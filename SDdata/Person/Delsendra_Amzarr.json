        "History": "Icespire Hold, a well-protected stone fortress on [[Icespire Peak]], was built by Delsendra Amzarr. She lived there for many years and kept the orcs of the Sword Mountains at bay. Eventually, a very harsh winter ended her reign. The extreme weather cut off the supply chains and Delsendra and her soldiers were trapped in the fortress and were starving. In their desperation, some of her followers rebelled against her. Delsendra was able to quell the uprising but with no chance of survival, she then committed suicide by drinking [[poison]].",
        "Emblem": "Delsendra Amzarr's emblem was a shield-shaped crest with a black tower being struck by a golden bolt of lightning."
