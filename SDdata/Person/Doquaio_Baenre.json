        "mainbody": "'''Doquaio Baenre''' was the second-boy of [[Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] at the time of [[Jarlaxle Baenre]]'s birth.",
        "History": "When Doquaio's younger brother [[Jarlaxle]] was born, he was set to be killed in a ritual because he was the third-born son. During the ritual, [[Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]] continually stabbed at Jarlaxle but failed to break his skin. Doquaio was ordered to assist, but as he grabbed the infant, all of the kinetic energy of the attempted sacrifice was reflected on to him through the [[psionic]] power of the matron mother of [[House Oblodra]], [[K'yorl Odran]]. Doquaio was killed, but Jarlaxle's life was spared.",
        "Relationships": "Doquaio was the son of Yvonnel Baenre and the older brother of Jarlaxle."
