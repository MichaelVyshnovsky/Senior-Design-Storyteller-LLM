        "mainbody": "'''Newander''' was a [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] at the [[Edificant Library]] in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] of [[Erlkazar]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Newander had blond hair.",
        "Personality": "The druid was a shy man who loved nature yet yearned for civilization at the same time, which aroused contradictory feelings in him regarding his faith.<ref> As a druid, he viewed the forest with love and wished to be as powerful as his friends, who had the ability to shape-change into various animals—an ability he had not yet developed.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1361}}, when the Edificant Library was assaulted by agents of [[Castle Trinity]], Newander joined his friends [[Danica Maupoissant]] and [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] in battle against the [[cleric]] [[Barjin]]. Newander and Cadderly were the only ones not affected by Barjin's [[Chaos Curse]]—potent magic that enhanced one's desires even until self-destruction. Newander resisted the curse to a high degree because his desires were contradictory and unclear even to the druid himself.\n\nIn the final battle with Barjin, the druid finally achieved the ability to shape-change into a great [[wolverine]] and sprayed Barjin with his musk. The musk disintegrated the mage's enchanted robes and thus weakened his defenses to a point where Newander's friends could overcome the cleric. But before Newander could get away, Barjin killed him with his enchanted mace, the [[Screaming Maiden]]."
