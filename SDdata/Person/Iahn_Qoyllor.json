He dressed with hide leggins the color of volcanic stone, and his leather vambraces were blood red from elbow to wrist.{{cite book/Darkvision|5-6}} Per a courtesan from [[Vaelan]], his arms were described as sinewy, and his skin as pale and exotic.{{cite book/Darkvision|107}}",
        "Abilities": "Iahn was an imaskari vengeance taker. He carried one of the 21 [[Damos]] of Deep Imaskar, which was the source of some of his supernatural abilities.{{cite book/Darkvision|89}} He most often used it to gain unique insights.{{cite book/Darkvision|7-9}}\n\nHe was also able to use some spells, likely ''[[blur]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'',{{cite book/Darkvision|45}} and ''[[invisibility]]''.{{cite book/Darkvision|226}} Disguises fashioned by Iahn included some components of illusion magic.{{cite book/Darkvision|110-111}} He was sensitive to flows of magic.{{cite book/Darkvision|112}} One of his daily protective spells warned him when under unseen observation.{{cite book/Darkvision|116}}\n\nDespite the diminished martial instruction available in Deep Imaskar,{{cite book/Underdark|139}} Iahn was an excellent fighter even by the standards of other races.\nHe wielded a repeating crossbow and a dagger that split between a stiletto and a butterfly knife.",

Shortly after, the two of them encountered [[Datharathi#Eined Datharathi|Eined Datharathi]]. She wanted their help stopping the production of Datharathi crystal; they accepted, though they only intended to seek an entrance to the Celestial Nadir.\nThe three of them chartered a ship towards Adama's Tooth, where they were confronted by [[Datharathi#Shaddon Datharathi|Shaddon Datharathi]].{{cite book/Darkvision|219}}\nThe wizard slew Eined,{{cite book/Darkvision|223}} and the two deep imaskari fought him; unable to slay him, they fled for an entrance to the Celestial Nadir.{{cite book/Darkvision|228-229}}\n\nIn the demiplane, they encountered [[Datharathi#Warian Datharathi|Warian Datharathi]] and [[Datharathi#Zeltaebar Datharathi|Zeltaebar Datharathi]].{{cite book/Darkvision|251}}\nFinding a path into the Palace of the Purple Emperor, they were briefly detained by a trap.{{cite book/Darkvision|275}}\n[[Prince Monolith]] and [[Kiril Duskmourn]] rescued them from it; after they joined, the six of them headed for the Imperial Weapons Cache.{{cite book/Darkvision|282-284}}\nThere, Iahn would fight the forces of Pandorym, using a crossbow he liberated from the very cache.{{cite book/Darkvision|299-300}}"
