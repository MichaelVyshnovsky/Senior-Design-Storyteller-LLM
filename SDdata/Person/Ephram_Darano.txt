Ephram Darano was a halfling wererat wizard near Spellgard in 1479 DR.
Ephram was the patriarch of the Darano, a halfling clan cursed with lycanthropy. In 1478 DR, he led his fellows to Spellgard, seeking Lady Saharels counsel with the hopes of finding a cure. However, during the full moon, an argument broke out and many Darano transformed and killed their fellow family members in a blood-fueled frenzy. Horrified by their actions, Ephram and his surviving fellows abandoned their quest and started living in one of the ruins, preying upon the seekers.
