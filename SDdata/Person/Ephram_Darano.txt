'''Ephram Darano''' was a [[halfling]] [[wererat]] wizard near [[Spellgard]] in [[1479 DR]].

==History==
Ephram was the patriarch of the [[Darano]], a halfling clan cursed with [[lycanthropy]]. In [[1478 DR]], he led his fellows to [[Spellgard]], seeking Lady [[Saharel]]'s counsel with the hopes of finding a cure. However, during the full moon, an argument broke out and many Darano transformed and killed their fellow family members in a blood-fueled frenzy. Horrified by their actions, Ephram and his surviving fellows abandoned their quest and started living in one of the ruins, preying upon the seekers.
