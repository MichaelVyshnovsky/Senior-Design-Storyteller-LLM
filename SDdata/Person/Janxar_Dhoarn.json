He was the richest mercenary captain in the city and a senior member of the Moonstars in 1370 DR.\nJanxar was an always-smiling broad-shouldered giant of a man.\nJanxar was well known for his honesty and integrity, which made him stand out in a land like Turmish, where disloyalty seemed commonplace.\nHe could gather an army at once if needed by Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun for the Moonstars. One of his primary jobs for the Moonstars was to train new agents in fighting techniques."
