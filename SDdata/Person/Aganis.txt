'''Aganis''' was a [[human]] man from the village of [[Pengallen]] in the [[Silver Marches]]. He was a barkeep of the local [[inn]].

==Personality==
Aganis was a large man, barrel-bodied, with a thick beard. He was often smiling, but was naturally rather nervous to have a [[drow]] in his bar.

==History==
In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1357}},<ref> Aganis was surprised and terrified to have a drow [[elf]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], walk into his bar. The leader of the village, [[Rico Pengallen]], had offered to pay for Drrizt's meal and Aganis gave him generous serves. He was nervous through the drow's stay, and worried that [[Jak Timberline]] would offend him.
