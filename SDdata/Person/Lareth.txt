'''Lareth''' was a [[gold dragon|gold]] great wyrm and the [[King of Justice]] until he was killed in [[1373 DR]].

==Personality==
Lareth was quiet and calm with a thoughtful manner and an incredibly dignity and sense of power. He was known for his ability to pull valuable wisdom from even the most trivial statements or writings. He liked to remain in his gold dragon form most of the time, but when needed to change into another form, he preferred that of an [[elf]].

==Allies==
Lareth was the most trusted comrade of the gold dragon [[Protanther]]. and [[Tamarand]], considering the latter to be his brother.

==Lair==
Nobody knew exactly where Lareth's lair was located, but it was believed that it was somewhere in the [[Great Desert]], or in the [[Elven Woods]] near [[Myth Drannor]], or on a magically concealed island in the [[Dragonmere]]. Only gold dragons knew for sure, but they didn't reveal this information to non-gold dragons.

==History==
At some point prior [[1357 DR]],

In the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Lareth was corrupted by [[Rage of Dragons|the Rage]] while trying to protect other [[metallic dragon]]s followers of [[Bahamut]] from the effects of the [[Dracorage]].

Some believed that Lareth's spirit lingered on in [[Faer√ªn]] after his death.

==Legacy==
After Lareth's death, magical daggers were made from his fangs. Called a ''[[dragontooth of Lareth]]'', these daggers were given to elite members of the [[Talons of Justice]], and were supposed to contain a part of the wisdom of the former King of Justice.
