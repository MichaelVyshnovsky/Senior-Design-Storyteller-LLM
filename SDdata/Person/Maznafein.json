        "mainbody": "'''Maznafein''' was a [[drow]] [[wizard]], turned [[drider]], who lived in the [[Underdark]] far below [[Icewind Dale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "The drider was once a powerful drow wizard living in [[Menzoberranzan]]. However, he detested the ways of [[Lolth]] and was subsequently transformed into a drider by a [[priestess]] of Lolth. \n\nSurprisingly, he still retained some of his spirit in his new form, and did not attack a band of adventurers. He requested that the companions search out a merchant of the name [[Ssar Tarell]], so that she might turn him back to his original drow form. He trusted in the companions' honor and, in return, gave them a Scroll of Spider Shape, to move across an otherwise impassable chasm.\n\nIt was later found out by the companions that the bulk of his spirit was kept captive by the throne of [[House Baenre]]. The spirit could be set free, turning Maznafein into his drow form, where he returned to Ssar Tarell's side. If the companions again sought him out, he informed them that their village's prisoners were being held in the commoner's room of [[House Do'Urden]]."
