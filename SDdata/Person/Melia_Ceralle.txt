'''Melia Ceralle''' was a female [[human]] operating on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Melia was a member of the [[Neverwinter Nine]]. After the lords were slaughtered, Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] sent her to watch over Lord [[Cyran Tavorick]].

===Gameplay===
When the [[Kalach-Cha]] and companions entered Tavorick's mansion, they would see Tavorick sending Melia away to the [[Moonstone Mask]]. When the Kalach-Cha and companions arrived at the Moonstone Mask, they saw Melia and her female soldiers being slain by [[Ammon Jerro|the warlock]], who took her shard away.
