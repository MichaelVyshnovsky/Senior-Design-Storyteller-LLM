Jamilah was a human barbarian who lived in Chult in the late years of the 15 century DR.
She was keen to partake in competitions of strength.
In her youth, Jamilah was involved in a shipwreck in which her parents were assumed to have perished. She was found by the sea near Chult and was adopted by the community as a daughter of the island. However, she wished to leave and as she grew—both in height and confidence—she finally left the island to roam free.
