        "mainbody": "Hrabbaz () was a bodyguard of House Gralhund in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR.\nHrabbaz protected both Yalah Gralhund and her husband Orond Gralhund.\nIn 1492 DR, the Gralhunds were involved in the search for the lost gold of Dagult Neverember under the promise of getting their fair share of the treasure. The Zhents led by Urstul Floxin used Gralhund Villa as their headquarters during their search for the Stone of Golorr.\nWhen a fight started between her guards and the Zhentarim, Hrabbaz was at his mistress Yalahs side and hid with her in her master bedroom. He was with her when she gave the Stone to her nimblewright servant with orders as to where to take it.\nHrabbaz always showed good manners and his clothes were immaculate.\nHrabbaz truly respected Yalah but would like to see Orond humbled."
