Feenoch the Five-Fingered was an infamous rogue and adventurer of the 1350s DR.
In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR, Feenoch was a member of a band of adventurers that rediscovered the fabled Barrochs Hold in the Glacier of the White Worm. However, they soon ran into a number of strange creatures, and were separated or killed. Feenoch, together with Yostur Ulhmond, made it to Orm to tell their story, though they would not be drawn on the matter of treasure. By the end of the year, it was said in Hillsfar they were trying to muster a larger group of adventurers, bearing sledges, perhaps intending to return.
