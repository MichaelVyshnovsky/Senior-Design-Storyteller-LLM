Louenghris died while on patrol within the ancestral crypts of House Vyshaan, after Galaeron and the shadow mage Melegaunt Tanthul inadvertently released the phaerimm from behind the Sharn Wall. Ironically, it was Lord Imesfor that originally made the appeal for Galaeron to gain admittance into the Tomb Guard.\nLord Imesfor was held in high esteem by his fellow gold elves within the city.\nWhen the Sharn Wall was breached beneath the Greycloak Hills in the , Lord Imesfor was among the high mages that attempted to repair the damage done and prevent the released phaerimm from overwhelming the Evereska Vale. While he was distraught over Louenghris death, In time he was rescued by Galaeron, Melegaunt, and the mages Vaasan followers. As the group fled the phaerimm through the Shadow Fringe, Melegaunt set Imesfor up as a decoy so the sorcerer and his followers could get away safely. Fortunatley, Lord Imesfor was able to teleport himself to Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep, the home of his comrade Khelben Arunsun, just as a mind flayer descended upon him.\nImesfor was tended to by his friend Khelben and Angharad Odaeyns, an elven healer dispatched from Evermeet. He relayed to them both the story of what had taken place and convinced Khelben and Lady Laeral Silverhand to aid in Evereskas defense.\nOn Tarsakh 24 of the following , Lord Imesfor served as Evereskas representative on the council that hosted Prince Aglarel Tanthul of Thultanthar, to discuss the tenuous alliance formed between the Shadovar and the realms of the Heartlands. The following month in Mirtul, he oversaw the defense of the Vine Vale alongside Evereskas ally Laeral Silverhand and Prince Lamorak Tanthul, Aglarels brother.\nIn the , Lord Imesfor traveled to Evermeet to ask their help to stop the Feyri invasion of Evereska."
