        "mainbody": "Lord '''Gervas Imesfor''' was a respected [[elven high mage]] that lived in the city of [[Evereska]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "He had one known son [[Louenghris Imesfor|Louenghris]], who served as a member of the [[Tomb Guard]] under patrol leader [[Galaeron Nihmedu]]. Louenghris died while on patrol within the ancestral crypts of [[House Vyshaan]], after Galaeron and the [[shadow mage]] [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] inadvertently released the [[phaerimm]] from behind the [[Sharn Wall]]. Ironically, it was Lord Imesfor that originally made the appeal for Galaeron to gain admittance into the Tomb Guard.\n\nLord Imesfor was held in high esteem by his fellow [[gold elves]] within the city.",
        "History": "When the Sharn Wall was breached beneath the [[Greycloak Hills]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Lord Imesfor was among the high mages that attempted to repair the damage done and prevent the released [[phaerimm]] from overwhelming the [[Evereska Vale]]. While he was distraught over Louenghris' death, In time he was rescued by Galaeron, Melegaunt, and the mage's Vaasan followers. As the group fled the phaerimm through the [[Shadow Fringe]], Melegaunt set Imesfor up as a decoy so the sorcerer and his followers could get away safely. Fortunatley, Lord Imesfor was able to ''[[teleport]]'' himself to [[Blackstaff Tower]] in [[Waterdeep]], the home of his comrade [[Khelben Arunsun]], just as a [[mind flayer]] descended upon him.\n\nImesfor was tended to by his friend Khelben and [[Angharad Odaeyns]], an elven healer dispatched from [[Evermeet]]. He relayed to them both the story of what had taken place and convinced Khelben and Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] to aid in Evereska's defense.\n\nOn [[Tarsakh 24]] of the following {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Lord Imesfor served as Evereska's representative on the council that hosted [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Aglarel Tanthul]] of [[Thultanthar]], to discuss the tenuous alliance formed between the [[Shadovar]] and the realms of the [[Heartlands]]. The following month in [[Mirtul]], he oversaw the defense of the [[Vine Vale]] alongside Evereska's ally [[Laeral Silverhand]] and Prince [[Lamorak Tanthul]], Aglarel's brother.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Lord Imesfor traveled to Evermeet to ask their help to stop the [[Fey'ri]] invasion of Evereska."
