Elyse was an orphaned homeless girl in Ravens Bluff in the late 1350s DR. She had a gift for prophecy.
Appearing to be aged 7 or 8, Elyse had blonde hair and wide blue eyes with an alert expression. Although homeless, she managed to find cleaner, better clothes than others in her situation.
She was polite and giggly.
Elyse begged for copper pieces and food from passersby, but sometimes related a cryptic prophecy or hidden truth for them.
Elyse didnt know the whereabouts of her parents, but hoped theyd come back for her soon.
She had a pet cat named Merrylson.
While local Ravenians knew Elyse well and liked her, they were uncomfortable with her because of her habit of saying things theyd rather keep hidden.
She had been an orphan for years. While Ravenian courts and temples tried to place her with a foster family, she kept running away.
In the , Elyse may have begged for money from a group of adventures, and told them a prophecy.
Elyse had a natural but rudimentary talent for psionics, being capable of empathy and precognition, as well as the mind thrust attack mode and the mind blank and thought shield defense modes. However, she couldnt control these, and only manifested them instinctively.
