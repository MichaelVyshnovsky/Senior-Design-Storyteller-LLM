'''Elyse''' was an orphaned homeless girl in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 1350s [[DR]]. She had a gift for prophecy.

|Excuse me, but could you please spare me a few coppers for food? I haven't eaten since yesterday and I'm really very hungry.
|Elyse
}}

==Description==
Appearing to be aged 7 or 8, Elyse had blonde hair and wide blue eyes with an alert expression. Although homeless, she managed to find cleaner, better clothes than others in her situation.

==Personality==
She was polite and giggly.

==Activities==
{{fq
| text   = How come your father was so mean to everybody? Was it because he looked funny?
| source = Elyse's awkward question for a [[half-drow]].
| float  = 
| width  = 
}}
Elyse begged for [[copper piece]]s and food from passersby, but sometimes related a cryptic prophecy or hidden truth for them.

==Relationships==
Elyse didn't know the whereabouts of her parents, but hoped they'd come back for her soon.

She had a pet cat named [[Merrylson]].

While local Ravenians knew Elyse well and liked her, they were uncomfortable with her because of her habit of saying things they'd rather keep hidden.

==History==
{{fq
| text   = You must accept a magical item you want and can't keep to have a chance to find a magical item you can't use but can keep.
| source = Elyse's prophecy for an adventurer.
| float  = 
| width  = 
}}
She had been an orphan for years. While Ravenian courts and temples tried to place her with a foster family, she kept running away.

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Elyse may have begged for money from a group of adventures, and told them a prophecy.

==Abilities==
Elyse had a natural but rudimentary talent for [[psionics]], being capable of ''[[empathy (psionic)|empathy]]'' and ''[[precognition]]'', as well as the ''[[mind thrust]]'' attack mode and the ''[[mind blank (psionic)|mind blank]]'' and ''[[thought shield]]'' defense modes. However, she couldn't control these, and only manifested them instinctively.
