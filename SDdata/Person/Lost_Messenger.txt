The Lost Messenger was a ghost that could be found wandering the Battle of Bones.
The Lost Messenger appeared as a transparent young boy.
Each night at the three oclock hour, the Lost Messenger wandered both sides of the battlefield for five minutes before disappearing, almost as if he was still trying to deliver his fateful message.
Though his real name remained unknown, the Lost Messenger served as a messenger between commanders of the human army during the actual Battle of Bones in 1090 DR. Minutes before the initial clash of forces, the young boy became lost in the darkness and wavered in front of the assembled mass of Izac Uthors horde of goblins and orcs. Claiming first blood of a battle was very important to the goblinkind. The boy was run down as Uthors army surged forward.
The Lost Messenger appeared on occasion in the court of King Azoun IV of Cormyr. Vangerdahast was confused by these seemingly random visits, but the priests of Tyr believed the Messenger appeared seeking to blame Artur Blevin, or one of his living ancestors, for his death.
