'''Beowen''' was a [[half-elven]] "[[Harper]]" agent who worked for a man named [[Teygan]] against the [[Zhentarim]]'s grab for power on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Beowen had medium-length blonde hair, delicate elven features, and a strong human body. He wore brown clothes and armor along with a [[cloak]].

==History==
[[Miyandra]] and Beowen both used false Harper identities when they accompanied Teygan—or the infamous [[Sememmon]], the enemy of [[Fzoul Chembryl]] of the Zhentarim—to a cave base outside the city of [[Daggerford]]. The three briefly aided the [[Hero of Daggerford]] in discovering the Black Network's plans for Daggerford. Once "Teygan" delivered invaluable hints and advice to the Hero, all three "Harpers" abandoned the cave base, happy with their involvement in the foiling of Fzoul's plans.
