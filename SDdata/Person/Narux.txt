Narux was a half-orc worshiper of Talos and a member of the anchorites of Talos in the late 15 century DR. Along with fellow anchorites Flenz and Yargath, he was responsible for overseeing rituals dedicated to Talos, god of storms, at the Circle of Thunder in southern Neverwinter Wood.
As an anchorite of Talos, Narux was a shapechanger&mdashable to adopt the form of a boar&mdashand a divine spellcaster able to invoke his gods power to cast lightning bolt.
Narux lived in a cave on the northeast side of the Circle of Thunder, and had few possessions save for those his fellow anchorites also shared, such as a pet boar. However, at some point he managed to acquire an enchanted shield, which he hid inside his cave by burying it beneath the floor.
Narux and his fellow anchorites conducted rituals at the Circle of Thunder in order to please Talos and to create storms. They also revered and would attempt to summon Gorthok the Thunder Boar, a primal spirit in service to Talos. These rituals often entailed blood sacrifices of animals or humanoids, followed by dancing around the victims corpse while wearing a rotted boars head as a mask.
