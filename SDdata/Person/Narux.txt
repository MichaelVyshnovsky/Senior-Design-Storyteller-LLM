'''Narux''' was a [[half-orc]] worshiper of [[Talos]] and a member of the [[anchorites of Talos]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Along with fellow anchorites [[Flenz]] and [[Yargath]], he was responsible for overseeing rituals dedicated to [[Talos]], god of storms, at the [[Circle of Thunder]] in southern [[Neverwinter Wood]].

==Abilities==
As an anchorite of Talos, Narux was a [[shapechanger]]&mdash;able to adopt the form of a [[boar]]&mdash;and a [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcaster able to invoke his god's power to cast ''[[lightning bolt]]''.

==Possessions==
Narux lived in a cave on the northeast side of the Circle of Thunder, and had few possessions save for those his fellow anchorites also shared, such as a pet boar. However, at some point he managed to acquire an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[shield]], which he hid inside his cave by burying it beneath the floor.

==Activities==
Narux and his fellow anchorites conducted rituals at the Circle of Thunder in order to please Talos and to create storms. They also revered and would attempt to summon [[Gorthok|Gorthok the Thunder Boar]], a [[primal spirit]] in service to Talos. These rituals often entailed blood sacrifices of [[animal]]s or [[humanoid]]s, followed by dancing around the victim's corpse while wearing a rotted boar's head as a mask.
