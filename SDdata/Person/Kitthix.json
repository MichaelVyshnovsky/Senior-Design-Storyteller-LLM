        "mainbody": "'''Kitthix''' was a semi-intelligent [[Cosmology|extra-planar]] [[huge spider|spider]] that could be summoned to the [[Prime Material Plane]] by means of a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]''.\n\nIt was unknown exactly which [[plane of existence]] from which Kitthix originated.",
        "Abilities": "Once every eight hours, Kitthix could be summoned by the unique ''black spider figurine''.\n\nLike most spiders, Kitthix had a toxic bite and could entangle foes within a form of magical webbing. This webbing ''[[paralyze]]d'' any creature caught within, but could be readily ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]''.\n\nIt also had a ''[[teleport]]ation'' ability that resembled those found amongst [[phase spider]]s.",
        "History": "As of the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, Kitthix's figurine was in the possession of [[Pai'Na]], the [[half-drow]] [[druid]] that dwelled within the catacombs beneath [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]] of [[Athkatla]]."
