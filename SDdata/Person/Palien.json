        "mainbody": "Palien was a warrior and a hero, who was celebrated for fending off several groups of monsters during the founding of Thundertree.\nPalien of Neverwinter set out to Thundertree to strike back at the monsters who attacked those in the area. The warrior fought many approaching monsters valiantly in Neverwinter Wood, with spear and shield, to the relief of the locals. In the honor of Palien, they erected a  wooden statue of the hero in the center of Thundertrees town square.\nSeveral years later, circa 1491 DR, the statue was still standing, despite the eruption of Mount Hotenow. It was, however, quite weathered and lent to one side."
