        "mainbody": "'''Palien''' was a warrior and a hero, who was celebrated for fending off several groups of monsters during the founding of [[Thundertree]].",
        "History": "Palien of [[Neverwinter]] set out to Thundertree to strike back at the monsters who attacked those in the area. The warrior fought many approaching monsters valiantly in [[Neverwinter Wood]], with [[spear]] and [[shield]], to the relief of the locals. In the honor of Palien, they erected a {{SI|10|ft}} wooden statue of the hero in the center of Thundertree's town square.\n\nSeveral years later, ''circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the statue was still standing, despite the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]]. It was, however, quite weathered and lent to one side."
