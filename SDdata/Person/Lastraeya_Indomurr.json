        "mainbody": "Lastraeya Indomurr was a human woman of Chessenta who moved to the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast. In the mid–14th century DR, she held the civic official position of the Regent of City Works and the heraldic office of The Ravencoat.\nLastraeya Indomurr hailed from Chessenta before relocating to Ravens Bluff in the Vast. She was once a tavern dancer before she worked in Ravens Bluffs Regency of City Works, in quite a low-ranking and little-known position by 1370 DR.\nThis changed when the then-current Regent of City Works, Bundrigo Dalastarra, was murdered in the summer of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. Scandal erupted as Bundrigos crimes were uncovered—he had operated a huge and well-oiled system of bribery, kickbacks, and informers, the greatest ever known in Ravens Bluff. He paid his hardworking officials well, though some believed the money ultimately came from pirates. Lord Chancellor Arvin Kothonos had a difficult time finding anyone in the Regency with any experience who wasnt tainted by Bundrigos web of corruption.\nAt last, Kothonos discovered Lastraeya Indomurr, finding her highly capable and free of corruption, and appointed her as Acting Regent. Lastraeya quickly proved herself, overhauled the Regency, and left not even a whiff of corruption. She so impressed Lord Chancellor Kothonos and Lady Mayor Amber Lynn Thoden that they confirmed her appointment later in 1370 DR.\nAs Regent, Lastraeya was entirely fair-minded and honest, and supremely capable, hardworking, and swift. She was apparently the most industrious person in Ravens Bluff, and it was said her tongue never slept.\nLastraeya had dusky-hued skin.\nCategoryFighters\nCategoryHumans\nCategoryOfficials\nCategoryDancers\nCategoryMembers of the Heralds\nCategoryInhabitants of Chessenta\nCategoryInhabitants of the Old Empires\nCategoryInhabitants of East Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Ravens Bluff\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\n2kc5h35vt4k941udqm2os0dcrmatnvl"
