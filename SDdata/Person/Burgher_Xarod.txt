'''Burgher Xarod''' was the original boss of the land that later became the [[Xiousing]] district in [[Marsember]].

==History==
Xarod controlled some of the neighborhoods around Xiousing and when the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] retreated, he assumed control of the newly exposed land. In [[1419 DR]], King [[Azoun V]] granted the [[Shou]] [[Duc-Sum Li]] regency over the Xiousing district, which infuriated Xarod. Even in his extreme old age, he plotted to regain the land he believed to be rightfully his.{{Cite dungeon/195/Backdrop: Xiousing}}
