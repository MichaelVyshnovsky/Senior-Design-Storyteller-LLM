        "mainbody": "Vyldara was a banshee bound to the ruins of Axeholm as of the late 15 century DR.\nAs a banshee, Vyldara appeared as a floating, spectral female elf clothed in tattered rags and with thin, wispy hair tangled around her face.\nWhen she was alive, Vyldara was manipulative and violent. In death, she was delusional and extremely quick to anger. Any attempt to speak with or reason with her was met with the full force of her terrifying power.\nIn life, Vyldara was a moon elf ambassador from her people to the dwarves of Axeholm. For unknown motives, she began trying to foment civil unrest amongst the dwarves, but her plan failed and she was imprisoned. The dwarves sent missives to the elves to demand that they come and personally remove her from their home, but as they waited for a reply, Vyldara attempted to escape. She killed two guards, but then was herself slain. Unfortunately for the dwarves, she then rose from the dead as a banshee. As her wails echoed through the halls, those who succumbed to her power rose as ghouls to feast on their kin. Axeholm was swiftly abandoned, and the entrance was sealed.\nMany years later, Axeholm had fallen into disrepair, and Vyldara came to see the ruin, and specifically the once magnificent guest room in which she had stayed as ambassador, as her \"house.\""
