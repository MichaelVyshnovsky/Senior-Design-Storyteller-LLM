        "Relationships": "Tornilee was a trusted comrade-at-arms of [[Yemandra Starbrow]], a monster-slayer of the [[Roadwarden Guard]].",
        "History": "In the early [[1360 DR|1360s DR]], when Arderiel was just 22 winters old, [[Arelin Starbrow]], the heroic [[Roadwarden]], perished in a treacherous monster ambush on the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]]. Her set of [[enchanted]] arms—the symbol of the office—were lost to the monsters. Subsequently, Yemandra Starbrow was tasked by her father with recovering the ''[[Lance]] of the Roadwarden''. In her stead, Yemandra sent Tornilee, who was to join a group of caravan guards in the arms' recovery. Together the group headed to a cavern claimed by [[hill giant]]s who, along with other creatures, slew the Roadwarden. Tornilee battled through hordes of giants, and eventually they faced the true leader of the monsters: a gluttonous [[blue dragon]] nicknamed [[Draconnis]]. After the wyrm was defeated, Tornilee and the adventurers retrieved the ''Lance of the Roadwarden'' from the dragon's hoard."
