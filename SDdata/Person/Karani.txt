Karani was a halfling priestess of Zaltec in Maztica.
She wore a brown tunic with red and blue details, with matching trousers. She was barefooted, and had a blue bandana wrapped around her head. Karani had blonde hair and light skin.
As was appropriate for the priestess of a war god, Karani was fierce in battle.
Karani owned an obsidian knife, a magical sling, a very powerful ring of protection, and two Quaals feather tokens (bird and tree).
She maintained a good friendship with the paladin Taxa, and the two shared many adventures.
