Jymahna was a renowned human concubine in Calimport,
In undeath she typically adorned herself in golden gowns and wrappings, as well as a magical silver funerary mask. The exact properties of this mask were unknown to others, as it was a secret coveted by Jymahna and Shangalar, but a wide array of speculation surrounded it (see below).
Jumahna had ties with various caravans, making her an important reservoir of news from distant lands.
A wide variety of speculation and tales told in taverns surrounded Jymahna and her mysterious mask. Some speculated that the silver mask Jymahna wore gave her the power to cast suggestion at will, charm person three times per day, and that it constantly exuded the friends spell in a  area around her. Other suggested that Jymahna lived on within the mask itself and that she would possess anyone that adorned. Still others believed that Jymahna wore the mask because bearing witness to her face would drive a person to madness, though such people hotly debated whether this madness was out of fear or infatuation with her beauty.
