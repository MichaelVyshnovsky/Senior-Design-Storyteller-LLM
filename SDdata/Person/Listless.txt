==Description==
Listless was a fair-skinned [[human]] man with sharp features, brown hair, and blue eyes. He wore dockworker's commoner clothes and a [[skullcap]] while aboard his vessel.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Listless was a lowly sailor and laborer who worked alongside [[wood elf]] [[Kadugan]] under Bosun [[Sharley]], who worked her crew hard. Kadugan was tasked with unloading the boat but lamented the fact that Bosun did not land under one of the docks' unloading cranes, making unloading that much harder for Kadugan and Listless, while Listless complained about cargo as heavy as [[lead]] and his [[lumbago]] issues.
