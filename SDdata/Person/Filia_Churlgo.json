        "mainbody": "'''Filia Churlgo''' was one of many children of [[Millie Churlgo]] who produced the infamous [[Churlgo Cheese]] in the [[Eastern Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\n{{quote|The best cheese is a stinky cheese! This one could use a little more stink.|Filia Churlgo}}",
        "Description": "Filia was one of the older Churlgo siblings. She had long brown hair and pale milky complexion. Her clothes where covered in strands of old melted [[cheese]].",
        "History": "Filia worked inside the farm building, rarely venturing outside. Her main role was seasoning of the huge cheese vats before it was portioned, solidified, and [[wax]]ed.\n\nFilia, along with the rest of her family, moved their farm from the [[Dalelands]] to [[Daggerford]] following a nasty extortion business with the [[Iron Throne]]. In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably not lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing."
