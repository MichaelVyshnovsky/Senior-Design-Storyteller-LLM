        "mainbody": "'''Taluku''' was a [[hunting spider katanga]] who served the [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] as her bodyguard within the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Abilities": "Taluku was an experienced warrior. He preferred to fight in bipedal form while starting combat by throwing ranged weapons at the enemy.",
        "Possessions": "The katanga was armed with a large [[enchanted]] wooden [[shield]] and carried five [[halfspear]]s into battle. Like other spider katanga, Morizuku could freely crawl across any surface, and his bite was a deadly venomous weapon.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Wise Ones]] tribe became aware of the leader of evil [[spider katanga]], the Mother of a Thousand Young, being ready to birth a thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly [[poison]]s into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. [[Morizuku]], along with Taluku, was tasked with guarding the venomous Mother at the center of her bones-riddled nest. Both katanga fought defensively when a band of heroes from the Living Jungles reached the Mother of a Thousand Young in an attempt to end the poisoning and the spawning.\n\nTaluku's fate remained unknown; however, his death was almost unavoidable as he and Morizuku fought until their dying breath to defend the Mother."
