Pharom Ildacer was the oldest surviving aquatic elf High Mage in Myth Nantar and a member of the Nantarn Council in the mid–14 century DR.
Pharom was promoted to High Mage in 1341 DR after his masters, the High Mages Taranath Reefglamor and Yrlimn Tidark, accepted new students.
On Flamerule 5, 1369 DR, he met with Loreweaver Pacys to help the bard in understanding the Prophecy of Thurlathiirn. In Marpenoth, the High Mages and Pacys went to Myth Nantar, where, to the High Mages surprise, Pacys easily opened the barrier surrounding the city, opening the Twelfth Serôs War. On Uktar 11, Pharom and his fellows cast magic that sent Iakhovas to the Outer Planes, ending the war, but only Pharom remained alive.
On Hammer 8, 1370 DR, Pharom permitted the malenti to settle in Myth Nantar.
Pharom endured the bad attitude of his cousin Morgan Ildacer but he knew too well the need for diplomacy. He had always been fascinated by the dukars magic and had started an exchange of spells with Lashyrr Maerdrymm in order to increase their respective knowledge.
He was also the one that designed the temple of Deep Sashelas in Myth Nantar, and helped shape the magic that would push the coral to grow in graceful spiraling towers and minarets.
