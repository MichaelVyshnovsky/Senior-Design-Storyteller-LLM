'''Pharom Ildacer''' was the oldest surviving [[aquatic elf]] [[Elven high mage|High Mage]] in [[Myth Nantar]] and a member of the [[Nantarn Council]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Pharom was promoted to High Mage in [[1341 DR]] after his masters, the High Mages [[Taranath Reefglamor]] and [[Yrlimn Tidark]], accepted new students.

On [[Flamerule 5]], [[1369 DR]], he met with Loreweaver [[Pacys]] to help the bard in understanding the [[Prophecy of Thurlathiirn]]. In [[Marpenoth]], the High Mages and Pacys went to Myth Nantar, where, to the High Mages' surprise, Pacys easily opened the barrier surrounding the city, opening the [[Twelfth Serôs War]]. On [[Uktar 11]], Pharom and his fellows cast magic that sent [[Iakhovas]] to the [[Outer Planes]], ending the war, but only Pharom remained alive.

On [[Hammer 8]], [[1370 DR]], Pharom permitted the [[malenti]] to settle in Myth Nantar.

==Activities==
Pharom endured the bad attitude of his cousin [[Morgan Ildacer]] but he knew too well the need for diplomacy. He had always been fascinated by the [[dukar]]s' magic and had started an exchange of [[spell]]s with [[Lashyrr Maerdrymm]] in order to increase their respective knowledge.

He was also the one that designed the temple of [[Deep Sashelas]] in Myth Nantar, and helped shape the magic that would push the coral to grow in graceful spiraling towers and minarets.
