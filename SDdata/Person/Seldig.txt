Seldig was a deep gnome fighter/illusionist from Blingdenstone.
Around  1357 DR, Seldigâ€™s svirfneblin patrol encountered Catti-brie disguised as a drow female, with the help of Agathas mask. In 1338 DR , Seldig and fellow gnome, Pumkato, played with Drizzt DoUrdens panther, Guenhwyvar, and they recognized the powerful beast as a friend, so they stopped the attack on Catti-brie.
In 1362 DR, the deep gnome finally, like his longtime friend Pumkato, become a burrow warden.
