Obsidian and marble were his materials of choice, though he used gems to enhances his projects.\nIf Jera was not completely satisfied with his work at any point during its construction, he would smash the object to bits and begin again.\nHe charged 500 dinars for a life-sized sculpture, and 100 for smaller ones. His piece depicting the Grand Caliph even adorned the Palace of the Enlightened Throne.\nHe outright refused to take an order for a piece depicting any kind of genie.\nUnbeknownst to the population of Huzuz, Jera was actually a markeen masquerading as a Zakharan. It was unknown what happened to the original Jera."
