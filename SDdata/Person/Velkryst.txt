}}'''Velkryst''' was the house patron of [[House Baenre]] and the mate of [[matron mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] circa [[1484 DR]].

==History==
The [[drow]] [[wizard]] was a former member of [[House Xorlarrin]]. Circa [[1400 DR]], Quenthel chose him as her patron despite his family's objections. Over the years, they had five daughters and two sons but around 1484 DR, Velkryst feared for his life as Quenthel grew bored of his affections.
