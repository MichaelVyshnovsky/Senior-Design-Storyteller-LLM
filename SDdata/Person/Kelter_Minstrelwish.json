        "mainbody": "Kelter Minstrelwish was an apprentice brewmaster at the Moon Mountain Brewery on the Unicorn Run in northwest Faer√ªn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nAs a young halfling, Kelter was more curious and daring than most of the inhabitants of the brewery.\nKelter was learning about all aspects of the business of running a brewery, being an apprentice of the two most senior members of the staff, Nurvala Minstrelwish and Yarimmur Borulglar. He was also quite good at spying and eavesdropping.\nNurvala and Yarimmur took Kelter under their wing when they found out that he had been spying on them and discovered their smuggling operation. The three halflings were the only ones at the brewery who knew that the human merchant named Tarth Brallowgath was also their contact in the Black Network. They smuggled coded messages and small, valuable objects inside barrels of ale, rum, and hard cider to recipients designated by Brallowgath."
