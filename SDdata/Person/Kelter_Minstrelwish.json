        "Relationships": "Nurvala and Yarimmur took Kelter under their wing when they found out that he had been spying on them and discovered their smuggling operation. The three halflings were the only ones at the brewery who knew that the [[human]] merchant named [[Tarth Brallowgath]] was also their contact in the [[Black Network]]. They smuggled coded messages and small, valuable objects inside barrels of [[ale]], rum, and hard [[cider]] to recipients designated by Brallowgath."
