'''Tansia''' was a woman from [[Fullpoint]]. She was stern-looking, and dark-haired. After Fullpoint was attacked by [[blightspawned]] [[volodni]] in the spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, the newly arrived cleric [[Marrec]] saved the village; as thanks, she agreed to lead him to [[Hemish]]'s home.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|17-18|2}}
