Yusten Karas was a drow assassin and sword master in the Moonsea in 1489 DR.
At one point, he was captured in Phlan and put in prison. With Vorgansharaxs coup in 1489 DR, he managed to escape.
However, soon after, near Twilight Marsh, he was again captured by the black dragon Throstulgrael and brainwashed to work for him. The Order of the Gauntlet desperately wanted him back alive, so eventually he was subdued by an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragons lair.
