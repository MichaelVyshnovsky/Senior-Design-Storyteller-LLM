'''Yusten Karas''' was a [[drow]] assassin and sword master in the [[Moonsea]] in [[1489 DR]].

==History==
At one point, he was captured in [[Phlan]] and put in prison. With [[Vorgansharax]]'s coup in 1489 DR, he managed to escape.{{Cite adventurers league/Raiders of the Twilight Marsh|6}}

However, soon after, near [[Twilight Marsh]], he was again captured by the [[black dragon]] [[Throstulgrael]] and brainwashed to work for him. The [[Order of the Gauntlet]] desperately wanted him back alive, so eventually he was subdued by an adventuring party sent to recover some items from the dragon's lair.
