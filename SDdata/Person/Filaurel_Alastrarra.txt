'''Filaurel Alastrarra''' was an inhabitant of [[Myth Drannor]] in the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==Appearance==
Of exquisite beauty, she had wild blue-black hair. During the evening in which [[Elminster Aumar]] came to her house, she wore a nightshift made of a collar holding up a sheer strip of thin, gauzy blue-green [[silk]]. It definitely covered her front, maybe not her back. To Elminster, when holding her, he found her sleek and soft.

==History==
At some point, Filaurel had a horrible nightmare about her brother, [[Iymbryl Alastrarra]], dying. In the {{YearlinkName|241}}, Elminster Aumar, guided by the ''[[kiira]]'' of Iymbryl and wearing his appearance, entered the [[Alastrarra]] residence; while he tried to sneak away after slaying [[Riluaneth]], she came across Elminster, and thinking him her brother, leapt to his neck, hugging him. When the forces of the house caught up with the disguised mage, Elminster used Filaurel as cover.

However, once the situation was cleared up, Filaurel was not upset with Elminster.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|103-108|5}}
