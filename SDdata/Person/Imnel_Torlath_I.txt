King '''Imnel Torlath I''', originally '''Jhurik Torlath''', was the second [[Torlath]] ruler of [[Amn]], and a famous general who participated in many battles.

==Relationships==
Imnel was the grandson of King [[Esmel Torlath I|Esmel I]], and the father of [[Rhadik Torlath I|Rhadik I]] His younger brother was Prince [[Amnur Torlath|Amnur]], also a legendary general.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|479}}, Prince Imnel led the armies of Amn against the [[ogre]]s of the [[Small Teeth]] in order to open up the roads between [[Murann]] and [[Crimmor]], called the [[Ogre Wars]]. During the great battle of [[Imnel's Scar]], his forces discovered the [[Armory of Nedeheim]], a cache of powerful magical giant-made weapons. He had the weapons removed to [[Athkatla]] for storage, and recorded the events in his journal, ''[[Imnel's Scar: A Personal History of the Ogre Wars]]''.

During the second year of his reign in [[512 DR]], the city of [[Esmeltaran]] finished construction and the capital was transferred there. The Armory of Nedeheim was also transferred to secure storage in the royal vaults.

King Imnel was finally slain in battle with the forces of [[Cortryn]] in [[520 DR]].
