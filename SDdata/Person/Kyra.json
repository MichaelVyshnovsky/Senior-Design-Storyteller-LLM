        "Personality": "Kyra was a laconic individual with great combat and survival skills. She did not agree at all with Florio's style of command.",
        "Relationships": "Kyra was a [[human]] ranger who, with her friends the [[Turami]] warrior [[Florio]], [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[cleric]] [[Rorik Ironheart]], and [[elf|elven]] [[druid]] [[Nualion Galanodel]], decided to form an adventuring party in [[Selgaunt]].",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], they went to Mulmaster with the intention of exploring some dwarven ruins in the [[Earthspur Mountains]], but the city watch sergeant, [[Audra Maskyr]], hired them to explore the city's sewers instead. During the exploration, they fought some large [[rat]]s and lost Rorik Ironheart in a flood. At that point, Kyra and the others met another adventuring party sent by Sergeant Maskyr, and, with their help, Kyra and her companions exited from the sewers."
