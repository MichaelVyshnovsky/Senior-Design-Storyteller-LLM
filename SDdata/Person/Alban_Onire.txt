Alban Onire, the Holy Knight of Duty, was a legendary warrior loyal to Torm.
The knight was a handsome man who wore shining plate mail similar to that of his deity, the Loyal Fury. His armor straps and belt smelled of fresh oil, and he owned a gem-covered scabbard. Apparently, he possessed the magical steel sword known as Titanslayer, and when wielded, he could not be harmed by giants.
Alban lived centuries prior to the 14 century DR, where he was known to be the bane of both dragons and giants. In his years, he performed many great deeds.
As of the 14 century DR, the stories of Albans might and heroism were known to many, including Torm himself, as well as his followers, such as Gwydion the Quick.
When Gwydion journeyed to Thar to fight Thrym, he came upon the rest place of Onire. Torm commanded him to take up Onires burden and use his sword in battle. As Gwydion did this, the body of the warrior disappeared. However, when Gwydion used the sword, the powers of Titanslayer did not hold, as if they never did. The warrior was slain by Thrym.
Upon being sent back to the Material Plane after death, Gwydion took up Albans sword once again. Here he used it to attack Dendar the Night Serpent.
