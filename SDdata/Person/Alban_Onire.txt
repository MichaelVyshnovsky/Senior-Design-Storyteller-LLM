'''Alban Onire''', the Holy Knight of Duty, was a legendary [[warrior]] loyal to [[Torm]].

==Description==
The knight was a handsome man who wore shining [[plate mail]] similar to that of his deity, the Loyal Fury. His [[armor]] straps and belt smelled of fresh [[oil]], and he owned a [[gem]]-covered [[scabbard]]. Apparently, he possessed the [[magical]] [[steel]] [[sword]] known as ''[[Titanslayer]]'', and when wielded, he could not be harmed by [[giant]]s.

==History==
===Life===
Alban lived centuries prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], where he was known to be the bane of both [[dragon]]s and giants. In his years, he performed many great deeds.

===Legacy===
As of the 14{{th}} century DR, the stories of Alban's might and heroism were known to many, including Torm himself, as well as his followers, such as [[Gwydion]] the Quick.

{{Quote
|Then behold the final resting place of Alban Onire, Holy Knight of Duty, known in his day as a foe of all evil giants.
|Torm to Gwydion the Quick
}}

When Gwydion journeyed to [[Thar]] to fight [[Thrym]], he came upon the rest place of Onire. Torm commanded him to take up Onire's burden and use his sword in battle. As Gwydion did this, the body of the warrior disappeared. However, when Gwydion used the sword, the powers of ''Titanslayer'' did not hold, as if they never did. The warrior was slain by Thrym.

Upon being sent back to the [[Material Plane]] after death, Gwydion took up Alban's sword once again. Here he used it to attack [[Dendar]] the Night Serpent.
