'''Arlond Stormserpent''' was a nobleman of House [[Stormserpent]] sometime prior to the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
A statuette of Arlond Stormserpent was kept in [[Stormserpent Towers]]. The statue was known as "Arlond Stormserpent Slaying a Dragon", and was used by [[Mirt]] as a projectile against the young Lord [[Broryn Windstag]], after the latter turned on him, alongside [[Marlin Stormserpent]], having released Mirt from an enchanted axe and realized that Mirt wasn't a [[blueflame ghost]] that he could command.
