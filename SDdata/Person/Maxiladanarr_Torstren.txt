'''Maxiladanarr Torstren''' was the [[Magister]] from {{yearlink|1322}} to {{yearlink|1328}}.

==Appearance==
Of average height, Maxiladanarr's hair was always unruly. He had a weathered face and sharp eyes.

==Personality==
He viewed wizards' duels as wasteful.

==History==
Maxiladanarr had explored much of Faer√ªn by both expedition and through magical scrying. He became the Magister after slaying two [[Red Wizards]] who summoned monsters to savage [[Ulraen]] of [[Eltabbar]], after he slew [[Veldribold]] of [[Calimport]], who had slain the previous Magister. His first act was to blast apart his own tower; he always hid both his magic and himself afterwards, making many believe he was actually dead. He traveled often by gates, and did not take a home again, working against the clock in expectation that some young upstart would catch up to him and take the mantle away. His main project was the breeding of a number of clans, akin to the project of another previous archmage, [[Olohmber Starnardyn]].

Maxiladanarr covertly manipulated them into arranged marriages, and let a profusion of magical scrolls find their way to these new clan members. He ultimately perished in an avalanche.
