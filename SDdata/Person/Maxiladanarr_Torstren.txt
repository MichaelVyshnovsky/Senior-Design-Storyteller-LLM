Maxiladanarr Torstren was the Magister from  to .
Of average height, Maxiladanarrs hair was always unruly. He had a weathered face and sharp eyes.
He viewed wizards duels as wasteful.
Maxiladanarr had explored much of Faer√ªn by both expedition and through magical scrying. He became the Magister after slaying two Red Wizards who summoned monsters to savage Ulraen of Eltabbar, after he slew Veldribold of Calimport, who had slain the previous Magister. His first act was to blast apart his own tower he always hid both his magic and himself afterwards, making many believe he was actually dead. He traveled often by gates, and did not take a home again, working against the clock in expectation that some young upstart would catch up to him and take the mantle away. His main project was the breeding of a number of clans, akin to the project of another previous archmage, Olohmber Starnardyn.
Maxiladanarr covertly manipulated them into arranged marriages, and let a profusion of magical scrolls find their way to these new clan members. He ultimately perished in an avalanche.
