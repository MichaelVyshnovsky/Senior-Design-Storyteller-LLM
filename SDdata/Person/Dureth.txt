Lord '''Dureth''' was a member of the [[Swords of Evereska]] that bravely defended his home city during a crisis that broke out in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
He was a longtime friend of Blademajor [[Aubric Nihmedu]], a famed [[bladesinger]], instructor at the Evereskan [[Academy of Arms]] and fellow Sword of Evereska.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Dureth joined his fellow Swords Aubric Nihmedu and [[Rhydwych Bourmay]] in battle against the [[phaerimm]] at the old fortress of [[Rocnest]]. During the fierceness of combat, Lord Dureth was able to share a few final words with his friend Aubric before the latter [[elf]]'s untimely death.
