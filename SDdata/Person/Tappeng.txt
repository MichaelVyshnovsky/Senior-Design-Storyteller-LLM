Tappeng was a chieftain in Bawa in 1357 DR.
Tappeng was the chieftain of the Kabundusil tribe, one of the most savage Bawani tribes. Other tribes lived in fear of those times when Tappeng led a party on a headhunting raid or decided to pillage others rice fields and burn their dwellings.
Tappeng was greatly concerned about the Bavanese and despised the subtle merchants who in his eyes truly ran the civilized kingdom. He promoted inter-tribal fighting because he believed it necessary to keep fit.
