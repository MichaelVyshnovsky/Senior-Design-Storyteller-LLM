One day, Mantides was sent to by Lady Sunrise Tylanna of the Morningstar Haven to the Sword Lane. Rumors had it that the Night Masks claimed one of abandoned warehouses there as heir warehouse. He quickly confirmed that the warehouse was indeed occupied by the Night Masks. Instead of returning to Tylanna, Mantides became consumed by vengeance. In his zeal, he viciously killed eight young Night Mask members with one escaping, the event called the Sword Lane massacre of the , and for this he was expelled from the church of Lathander, leaving him a broken man, often drowning his sorrows in ale.\nAround the , Mantides was said to had joined an adventurer who just recently arrived to Westgate to fighting the Night Masks. The adventurer witnessed Mantides being harassed by Screeb and other drunken ruffians in the Black Eye tavern in Westgate harbor. The drunkards accused Mantides of being a washed out drunk, insinuated he host his holy sword and that the church took his manhood when it stripped Mantides of paladinhood. Despite harassment, Mantides did not stoop to violence.\nMantides did not recognize the adventurer but their other companion, a woman named Rinara, looked familiar.
