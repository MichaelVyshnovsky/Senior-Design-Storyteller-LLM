        "mainbody": "Starmara Dagohnlar was a wealthy merchants wife in the late 14 century DR.\nStarmara was no longer attracted to her husband, the merchant Durexter Dagohnlar, and at times considered his death. She had a broad network of contacts, good enough that she already knew on sight that Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar, two importers and underworld figures, were working with Harnrim Starangh. She didnt trust her servants one bit.\nStarmara took Westgate as a place of safety, and had visited it at least once, a house-of-baths being familiar to her.\nOne night in the early spring of the , Starmara and her husband were taken captive by Malakar Surth and Aumun Tholant Bezrar.\nDespite Starmaras pleadings, however, they were not rescued, and finally resorted to gnawing away at their bindings. Bezrar escaped shortly after by dawn, the two Dagohnlars were still cowering, almost certainly still bound, but Malakar also chose to flee rather than slay them.\nThey were later found by the Guard while giving a statement, she was rather displeased with her husbands caginess."
