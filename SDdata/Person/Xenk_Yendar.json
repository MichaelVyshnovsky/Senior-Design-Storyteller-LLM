        "mainbody": "enk Yendar  but was renowned as a holy warrior, healer, and hero in his own right.\nA handsome and muscular man, he had an altogether striking appearance.With a similar design to Dralass seen at his hairline, Xenk most likely has more tattoos on his scalp that are covered by his hair, which he may have grown to conceal them.\nHe wore ornate half-plate armor trimmed and emblazoned with gold designs, over blue-green attire and under a fine cloak.\nthumb|left|250px|The rod up his backside is his spine.\nThe very image of the knight in shining armor, of the resolute paladin, Xenk embodied what it meant to be a heroic divine warrior against all the odds. He had sworn an Oath of Devotion to help the innocent and uphold justice and he had a reputation for kindliness, honor, and integrity. His longevity gave him a farther perspective and more experience than most, yet it could also be a burden upon him. Xenk regretted that as a boy he had taken fright and ran and not been able to save his parents from becoming zombies in service to Szass Tam.\nHe endeavored to inspire goodness in his companions. He was always ready to share his knowledge and wisdom with others, but all too often, those others were not willing or patient enough to listen.Its unknown which deity Xenk follows as a paladin Ilmater, god of martyrdom and suffering, or Torm, god of duty and loyalty, seem the best matches. Leaks from earlier versions of the Honor Among Thieves script mention the Triadic Knights (followers of the Triad of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr, god of justice), suggesting this aspect was lost in rewrites.\nXenk dealt with every issue with complete dedication and conviction, which made him seem too serious to others.\nthumb|right|350px|Well, its no holy avenger, but its close.\nXenk had an aura about him that helped protect those near him from harm. With his cleansing touch, he could not only heal a fellow creatures wounds but also cure what ailed them as with lesser restoration. He was capable of other divine magic and had great prowess as a warrior, and could cause his blades to strike with a radiant energy. He could sense the presence of evil by smelling it.\nDespite his holiness, Xenks close brush with undeath left him aging slower than a human otherwise should. This gave him great longevity—he grew to be more than a century old. He also possessed darkvision.\nthumb|right|350px|At least this way throwing his sword doesnt leave him unarmed.\nHe wielded a unique daggersword, a longsword that could come apart into both a dagger and a shortsword, making him a very versatile warrior. With this, he could fight with the longsword&mdashwhich he would imbue with radiant power&mdashor he could dual-wield both shortsword and dagger to pick apart his opponents defenses. Furthermore, he could launch its blade like a spear at an opponent with enough force to skewer a target and knock them down, and still leave him with armed with the dagger. Shortly after, the blades would magically reattach. On its blade was inscribed, in the Celestial language, the legend \"Neither Virtue Nor Blade Shall Break,\" ironically enough.\nHe wore half plate armor.\nXenk spent his days traveling the realms of Faerûn in search of villainy to oppose, innocents to protect, and good deeds to do.\nHe was athletic and insightful, and was learned in history and skilled in survival, and also had keen hearing.\nHe was an old enemy of the undead Thayan assassin Dralas.Notably, Xenk and Dralas display the same Thayan tattoo at their hairline, hinting at a stronger connection, but this is not explored.\nXenk grew up in the land of Thay,Honor Among Thieves only says \"the capital\" of Thay, which at the time should be Eltabbar. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tams tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead. His parents were downtrodden subjects of the Red Wizards of Thay. \nAs Xenk would recall, when he was a boy in the mid-1370s DR, Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of Thaymount, Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on the eve of the summer solstice. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.Honor Among Thieves mentions only the eve of the solstice due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god Amaunator has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass demanded all Thayans abandon their mortality and serve him in undeath. Then Szass used the horn of beckoning death to invoke a terrible red smoke that consumed their souls, thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain or trapped within by the Red Wizards.It is difficult to reconcile Xenks account and the scenes in Honor Among Thieves with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tams betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in The Crimson Gold in 1373 DR the meeting of the Council of Zulkirs in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tams takeover of Thay in Unclean in 1375 DR and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenks childhood memories, its presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization.\nEscaping the lich-ruled nation of Thay, Xenk was forced to live in exile as a wanderer of the Realms for the next century. In his time, he performed many great and heroic deeds.\nthumb|right|350px|Xenk being entrusted with the helmet of disjunction by the dying Ven Salafin.\nCirca 1400 DR,The battle is undated but is \"a century ago\" from the date of Honor Among Thieves, which is itself undated but assumed to be the late 1490s DR. The , is a likely candidate. Xenk arrived amidst the Battle of the Evermoors as it raged between the Uthgardt Elk tribe and the Cult of the Dragon, together with their black dragon master, Rakor. Hoping to save lives, Xenk ran into the fray and found a dying warrior with a vital mission—Ven Salafin, who was struggling to get the helmet of disjunction away from the cultists. Xenk inspected his wounds and found he could not help him, but promised to keep the helmet of disjunction safe. Believing him, Ven gave up the helm and expired. In the end, all he could save was the helmet.\nHaving inherited this quest, Xenk hastened to Waterdeep, where he found the mage Mordenkainen from the world of Oerth. Though he had first crafted the helmet of disjunction, he wanted nothing to do with \"the accursed thing\" and sent Xenk away. Xenk later clashed with the Cult of the Dragon and a dracolich who sought again to claim the helm from him.\nLooking for some deep dark place to hide the helmet of disjunction, Xenk ventured underground, into the Underdark itself. There, he was soon assaulted by a mind flayer, which wished to give the helm to his master, the elder brain Zuphelithid. Though it tried to eat his brain, and got as close as sucking on his head, in order to liberate their people from the mind flayers thralldom. Soon enough, Xenk caught up with them and heard their plight, but he didnt think it wise for them to risk using the helm. So the sisters demanded he liberate their family from the mind flayers instead, but Xenk hardly needed to be asked.\nthumb|right|250px|right|Brains versus brave.\nXenk found and confronted the illithid overseers, demanding their surrender, but was surprised by the elder brain Zuphelithid and a pack of intellect devourers. He battled through the walking brains and resisted the psychic assault that reawakened his old regrets about not saving him family, until a mind flayer enthralled Trick and took her the helmet of disjunction both. Xenk got Trap to safety before she could be caught too. They healed up and created a new and ingenious plan. This time, Xenk challenged Zuphelithid to a compelled duel to the death. But it was a ruse, and Xenk fought and kept the elder brain in place long enough for Trap to drive a drill-headed mining machine into it, and Xenk split it in twain with his sword. The remaining illithids escaped and the svirfnebli were liberated.\nAfterward, the deep gnomes thanked Xenk and wished to repay him. He asked only that they conceal the helmet of disjunction within the ruins of the hanging city of Dolblunde. They fashioned a mechanical locked vault inside a statue, and declared it to be \"the last place anyone who values their life would go.\" Trick and Trap and all the deep gnomes waved Xenk farewell. He departed them and emerged from the Underdark in the region of Neverwinter.\nOn one occasion, Xenk worked with the Emerald Enclave, an order of guardians of nature, to thwart the destructive schemes of the church of Talos, the Storm Lord.\nOn another, he fought battles in the desert of Anauroch beside a warrior of the Elk tribe this man, a cousin of Holga, vouched for him as a good man.\nOnce, Xenk even held back a beholder with nothing more than a sharpened gourd, or something else sharp, at least according to Simons uncle.\nthumb|left|300px|When you realize that, once again, youre the only one who read the lore.\nBy the late 1490s DR, Xenk was operating out of the village of Mornbryns Shield on the River Surbrin, Edgin was scornful, thinking all Thayans were killers corrupted by the evil Red Wizards of Thay and disgusted by Xenks righteousness. Nevertheless, the others gained Xenks interest by speaking of their desire to rob and bring down the corrupt and tyrannical Lord Forge Fitzwilliam of Neverwinter and of his connection to a Red Wizard, Sofina.\nXenk led the party into the Kryptgarden Forest, where an entrance to the Underdark lay, in a deep hole that he termed \"the orifice\". On the way, he asked about Edgins past, why he had left the Harpers and Zias death, whilst warning that Zia may not be willing to be resurrected. He also tried to improve Edgins views of Thayans by sharing his own tragic past.\nthumb|right|350px|Even fearless paladins have \"Oh, naeth!\" moments.\nAfter venturing down into the Underdark, the party passed uninterested intellect devourers and arrived at the ruins of Dolblunde, wherein Xenk had hidden the helmet of disjunction long ago. After negotiating the trapped collapsing bridges, that is triggering and collapsing them before Xenk could finish explaining the intricately complicated technique needed to cross them, Simon noticed that Marlamins walking stick was in fact a Hither-Thither Staff, and they used it to cross into the city. Finding and opening the gnomish mechanical box, Xenk retrieved the helm. But that was when a band of undead Thayan assassins led by Dralas showed up, having been sent by Sofina to find and kill the thieves. Xenk and Dralas taunted one another it was not the first time theyd clashed. They fought valiantly, with Xenk handily taking down the whole squad of assassins and impressing the others, as his companions provided a little aid\nthumb|right|300px|A parting of the ways.\nSome time later, with the helmet of disjunction in their possession, they emerged in the Sea of Swords and swam to shore, where they rested on the rocky beach. There, Xenk said his farewells though they asked him to stay and assist them, he preferred to let Edgin, Holga and the others use what they had and rise to the occasion themselves rather than for him to keep carrying them himself. He departed down the beach, heading off for adventures anew.\nIn time, Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric would save Neverwinter, and Edgin even kept his oath to Xenk about distributing the wealth among the people of the city. Afterward, Xenk encountered the fugitive Forge Fitzwilliam in a forest one night and returned him to face justice he was incarcerated in Revels End."
