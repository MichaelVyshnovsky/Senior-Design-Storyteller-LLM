'''Illsenstaad''' ({{Pronounce|ILL|shun|stodd|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|25}}}}) was a [[stone giant]] and the second son of [[Obadai]].

==History==
Illsenstaad spent much of his life creating the many friezes within [[Hotun-Shûl]], having been charged by his father Obadai with documenting both the tangible and religious history of the [[giant]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|17}}

Around the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], 400 years prior to [[1366 DR]]{{Giantcraft date}}, Illsenstaad was killed in his living quarters by one of the many [[earth elemental]]s unleashed by [[grimlock]]s assaulting Hotun-Shûl.

Instead of passing on to the afterlife, Illsenstaad lingered in the temple as a [[ghost]], his spirit tormented by the fact that he never got to finish carving the friezes for a room{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|20}}

He would spend the following centuries working tirelessly to carve runes into the large statue that laid in Hotun-Shûl's central rotunda, eventually transforming it into a [[rune-forged guardian]] to protect the temple.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|22}}
