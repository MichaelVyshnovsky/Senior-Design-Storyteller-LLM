Illsenstaad () was a stone giant and the second son of Obadai.
Illsenstaad spent much of his life creating the many friezes within Hotun-Shûl, having been charged by his father Obadai with documenting both the tangible and religious history of the giants.
Around the 10 century DR, 400 years prior to 1366 DR, Illsenstaad was killed in his living quarters by one of the many earth elementals unleashed by grimlocks assaulting Hotun-Shûl.
Instead of passing on to the afterlife, Illsenstaad lingered in the temple as a ghost, his spirit tormented by the fact that he never got to finish carving the friezes for a room
He would spend the following centuries working tirelessly to carve runes into the large statue that laid in Hotun-Shûls central rotunda, eventually transforming it into a rune-forged guardian to protect the temple.
