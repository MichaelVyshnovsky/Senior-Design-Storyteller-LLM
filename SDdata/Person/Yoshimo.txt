'''Yoshimo''' was the roguish [[bounty hunter]] from [[Shou Lung]] who operated in the city of [[Athkatla]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{Quote|''"I can dance on the head of a pin as well."''|Yoshimo}}

==Description==
In addition to his prowess as a thief, Yoshimo was skilled at sewing and hemming.

Despite his duplicitous nature, Yoshimo venerated the god of suffering, [[Ilmater]]. At the end of his life he hoped to find favor with the Crying God.

==Personality==
Yoshimo was quite good-natured and often lavished others with excessive compliments. He went on like this to the point where it was seen as disingenuous by others.

==Possessions==
He owned a unique, ''[[Yoshimo's katana|enchanted katana]]'' that could be wielded only by him.

==Activities==
Yoshimo worked as an freelance thief in Athkatla, removed from the activities of the [[Shadow Thieves]].

==History==
Not much is known about Yoshimo's origins save for the fact he came from the empire of [[Shou Lung]].In the [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn (novel)|Shadows of Amn novel]], Yoshimo is said to be from [[Kozakura]].

At some point he had come into the debt of [[Renal Bloodscalp]] for infringing upon their operations.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Yoshimo was in the service of the [[mage]] [[Jon Irenicus]], compelled to do his bidding under pain of a ''[[geas]]''.

When the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]] escaped from Irenicus' imprisonment in [[Mirtul]] of that year, Yoshimo posed as a fellow escaped prisoner to gain his trust and track his movements in the city of [[Athkatla]]. 

Some time later the hero broke into the asylum of [[Spellhold]] to confront Irenicus and rescue their sibling [[Imoen]]. Yoshimo revealed his treachery and raised his weapon against him, seeking to die in battle rather than by the agony of a broken ''geas''.<ref group="note">In the novel Yoshimo is slain by [[Imoen]] when is transformed into the [[Slayer]].
