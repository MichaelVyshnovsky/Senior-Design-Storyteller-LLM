        "mainbody": "'''Bazoril Gimlode''' was a [[dwarven]] merchant that operated on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Possessions": "Bazoril sold a variety of goods including [[potion]]s of [[Potion of healing|healing]] and [[potion of rejuvenation|rejuvenation]], medical supplies, and various kits that allowed [[adventurer]]s to better utilize their skills out in the world.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Bazoril and his caravan were traveling along the [[High Road]] near [[Raven Cliff Beach]] when they were ambushed by [[Blackdagger Bandits]]. While the caravan was halted the group managed to make camp, receiving stalwart protection from [[Yates|\"Dusty\" Yates]], the sergeant of the caravan guard. They remained pinned down without supplies for a time, unable to send runners for aid due to the tracking skills of the Blackdagger [[gnoll]] trackers. Fortunately, [[Melkhor Goldseeker]] sought aid from a [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge|local adventurer]] that worked with Sergeant Yates to reverse their fates."
