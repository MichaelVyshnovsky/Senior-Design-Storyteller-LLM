'''Placidor''' was a [[dwarf]] and the hero of the [[Battle of Twelvesuns]].

Descendants of Placidor could call themselves "Blood of Placidor" under the traditional dwarven naming system. However, in the mid–14th century [[DR]], one such descendent declined as an act of rebellion, naming himself "[[Onyx the Invincible]]" instead.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye|25}}
