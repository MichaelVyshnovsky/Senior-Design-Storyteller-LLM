Placidor was a dwarf and the hero of the Battle of Twelvesuns.
Descendants of Placidor could call themselves "Blood of Placidor" under the traditional dwarven naming system. However, in the mid–14th century DR, one such descendent declined as an act of rebellion, naming himself "Onyx the Invincible" instead.
