'''Eravien Haund''' was a [[half-elf]] and a noble member of the [[Lords' Alliance]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Eravien was of both [[moon elf]] and [[Tethyrian]] descent, but lived in [[Waterdeep]].

Around [[1486 DR]],<ref>, Eravien was the Lords' Alliance delegate to King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] of [[Gauntlgrym]] to discuss the madness spreading in the [[Underdark]], despite not believing personally in the threat. He also knew that a deep-cover agent of the Lords' Alliance in the Underdark, [[Khelessa Draga]], had recently gone silent.

==Personality==
The half-elf was a charming and sly courtier, able to be immediately size up any social situation. However, he focused too much on socializing, distracting him from important information.
