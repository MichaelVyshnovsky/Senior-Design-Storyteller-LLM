Marsara Storntil was a law enforcement officer in the town of Voonlar sometime during the term of Bron Buorstag Hlammythyl, i.e., from about 1355 DR until at least 1372 DR.
Marsara was the only female deputy in Voonlar during this time and was very protective of her privacy. She did not tolerate public speculation about her love life.
Marsara was a specialist with the battleaxe.
She wore chain mail
Marsara started her military life in Zhentil Keep but was traveling through Voonlar when she received a sign. Being a devout follower of Cyric, she believed it was from the Dark Sun and meant that she should stay in Voonlar. She kept the details of her religious experience to herself.
About every two tendays or once a month, a female Zhent wizard named Tamelia came to visit Marsara and this led to hushed gossip about her love life. A drunken farmhand who fancied himself a suitor of Marsara did not take rejection quietly and repeated the gossip to her face. She beat him severely and that was the last anything was heard in public about the matter.
