==Personality==
Marsara was the only female deputy in Voonlar during this time and was very protective of her privacy. She did not tolerate public speculation about her love life.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|6}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 4: Justice and the Law}}

==Abilities==
Marsara was a specialist with the [[battleaxe]].

==Possessions==
She wore [[chain mail]]{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|3}}

==History==
Marsara started her military life in [[Zhentil Keep]] but was traveling through Voonlar when she received a sign. Being a devout follower of [[Cyric]], she believed it was from the Dark Sun and meant that she should stay in Voonlar. She kept the details of her religious experience to herself.

About every two [[tenday]]s or once a month, a female Zhent [[wizard]] named [[Tamelia]] came to visit Marsara and this led to hushed gossip about her love life. A drunken farmhand who fancied himself a suitor of Marsara did not take rejection quietly and repeated the gossip to her face. She beat him severely and that was the last anything was heard in public about the matter.
