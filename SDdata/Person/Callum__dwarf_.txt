'''Callum''' was a male [[dwarf]] and a member of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

==History==
Callum was one of the members of the Neverwinter Nine. When Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] issued an order to open a route to [[Yartar]], he sent Callum to [[Old Owl Well]] to attack the [[orc]]s there.

Callum may have issued the [[Kalach-Cha]] with an order to find [[Issani]], the messenger from [[Waterdeep]], who did not arrive, as well as to contact [[Casavir|someone]] who was attacking the orcs. Once the orcs' leaders, [[Yaisog]] and [[Logram]], were defeated, Callum congratulated them and Casavir (the latter being his friend) then rewarded them.

During the Kalach-Cha's trial, Callum may have told of the victory at the Old Owl Well, as the fact Kalach-Cha helped him. [[Torio Claven|Torio]] then asked if he knew that the Kalach-Cha's lawyer, [[Sand (individual)|Sand]], was from Luskan. The Kalach-Cha then had to persuade Callum that Sand being from Luskan had no bearing on the trial. If successful, Callum would then ignore Torio.

Later, Callum appeared fighting a [[shadow reaver]] and his [[blade golem]]s. Before dying, Callum warned the Kalach-Cha that [[Highcliff]] had fallen to the enemy.
