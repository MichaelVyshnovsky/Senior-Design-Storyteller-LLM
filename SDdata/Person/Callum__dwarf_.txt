Callum was a male dwarf and a member of the Neverwinter Nine on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR.
Callum was one of the members of the Neverwinter Nine. When Lord Nasher Alagondar issued an order to open a route to Yartar, he sent Callum to Old Owl Well to attack the orcs there.
Callum may have issued the Kalach-Cha with an order to find Issani, the messenger from Waterdeep, who did not arrive, as well as to contact someone who was attacking the orcs. Once the orcs leaders, Yaisog and Logram, were defeated, Callum congratulated them and Casavir (the latter being his friend) then rewarded them.
During the Kalach-Chas trial, Callum may have told of the victory at the Old Owl Well, as the fact Kalach-Cha helped him. Torio then asked if he knew that the Kalach-Chas lawyer, Sand, was from Luskan. The Kalach-Cha then had to persuade Callum that Sand being from Luskan had no bearing on the trial. If successful, Callum would then ignore Torio.
Later, Callum appeared fighting a shadow reaver and his blade golems. Before dying, Callum warned the Kalach-Cha that Highcliff had fallen to the enemy.
