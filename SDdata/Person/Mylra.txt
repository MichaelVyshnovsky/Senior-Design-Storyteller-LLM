Mylra was a priestess of Loviatar active in the Thayan city of Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
She was the High Priestess of Loviatars Manor, the largest temple to her goddess in not only Thay but perhaps all of Faer√ªn.
She was known to be active in all forms of "worship" that transpired within the Manors walls.
She was said to be especially "skilled" with a whip.
