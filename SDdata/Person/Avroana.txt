Avroana was a Sharran high priestess at the House of Holy Night in the midâ€“8 century DR.
She wore a mantle of deepest purple, a horned black headdress, and was the tallest priestess at the temple. She didnt smile much, and she had a sharp voice. Her boots had knife-bladed toes.
She carried a lash for ritual purposes.
Dread Brother Elryn was always wary she might be scrying.
During the Chaos of the Art in the , she could cast a spell that teleported several people. Another of her abilities allowed her to puppeteer a corpse from a distance, and cast flames from their mouth, but appeared to open her to backlash if the corpse was harmed.
In the spring of the , Avroana received a sending from Shar herself that Dread Brother High Narlkond was striving for something that would bring them great power and opportunity. He then explained that he had trapped Queen Dasumia, an avatar of Mystra, and could siphon her power freely to cast arcane spells through continued human sacrifice.
Upon hearing of a Chosen of Mystra somewhere near Westgate, Avroana sent Dread Brother Elryn, a fellow Sharran, and five Dreadspells with him.
After Klalaerla found Elryn fleeing Azuth, who was fully manifested at Karsus Keep, and herded his team back towards the ruins, their team came under attack by Umbregard and Starsunder, two meddling mages. During the fight, Dreadspell Daluth attacked and slew Klalaera. Darklady Avroanas voice came out of the corpses lips, and she killed him back the corpse was then struck by a sphere of purple flame cast forth by Tenthar Taerhamoos. There was a backlash upon Darklady Avroana, who caught fire with the same purple flames while on fire, she stumbled accidentally into the midst of an ongoing human sacrifice, getting a knife through the sternum from her own faithful.
