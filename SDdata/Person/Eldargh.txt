'''Eldargh''' was a [[malaugrym]] in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
In 1358 DR, during the hunt for [[Elminster Aumar]], Eldargh was among the many malaugrym that suddenly attacked El en masse. However, when the [[Simbul]] revealed herself to be disguised among them, and started killing his fellows, Eldargh confronted her. This gave most of his brethren time to go back to the [[Castle of Shadows]] but at the price of Eldargh's life.
