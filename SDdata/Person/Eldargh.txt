Eldargh was a malaugrym in 1358 DR.
In 1358 DR, during the hunt for Elminster Aumar, Eldargh was among the many malaugrym that suddenly attacked El en masse. However, when the Simbul revealed herself to be disguised among them, and started killing his fellows, Eldargh confronted her. This gave most of his brethren time to go back to the Castle of Shadows but at the price of Eldarghs life.
