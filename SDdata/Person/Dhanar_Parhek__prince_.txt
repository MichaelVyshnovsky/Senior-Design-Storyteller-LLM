Prince '''Dhanar Parhek''' "the Younger" was an unfortunate [[Amn]]ian son of the [[Parhek]] dynasty.

==Relationships==
Dhanar was the eldest son of King [[Dhanar Parhek]]. He was the twin brother of Princess [[Rasa Parhek|Rasa]], and the older brother of Prince [[Malek Parhek (prince)|Malek the Coinmage]].

==History==
Dhanar the Younger was kept in the royal court of [[Tethyr]] after his father was killed and Amn fell into civil war. Unfortunately, in the {{YearlinkName|1277}}, he suffered an unfortunate "hunting accident" at the same time as King [[Errilam I]] (actually the work of [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] assassins).
