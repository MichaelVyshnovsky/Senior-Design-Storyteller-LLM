'''Ulma''' was the leader of [[Gur]] monster hunters that traveled along the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Western Heartlands]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Chieftain Ulma was an aging [[human]] woman with tanned skin and hair whitened by time. He was armored in a quality [[breastplate]], plate armor gauntlets, and a pauldron while carrying an [[enchanted]] [[greataxe]] she called ''[[The Undead Bane]]'' strapped to her back.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ulma's monster hunter tribe found itself targeted by the [[vampire]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute]] crisis when the Gurs camped in the [[Rivington]] district of the city, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict. To the Gurs' horror, the tribe's children were abducted by [[Astarion Ancunín]] under orders from [[Cazador Szarr]]. Ulma ordered the [[vampire spawn]] to be found and interrogated with [[Gandrel]] being among the hunters who were to scour the [[Western Heartlands]].

When the [[True Soul]] heroes reached Baldur's Gate in their quest to end the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Astarion Ancunín was among these adventures. Ulma realized that the strange vampire was unaffected by the sun and not under Lord Szarr's control. She asked for an audience with the heroes and the vampire spawn right after Ulma performed a funeral pyre ceremony for the tribe's dead. The funeral was for those who perished in the Gur attack on Cazador Szarr's lair in a failed attempt to rescue the children. Ulma pleaded with Astarion and his comrades to infiltrate the spawn's old master's manse and save the Gur children from damnation.

The outcome of Astarion's infiltration and the fate of the Gur children remained unknown, and with them – Ulma's hunter tribe's fate.
