Lord '''Donovan Lightfinger''' was a wealthy aristocrat in [[Waterdeep]] and the original patriarch of the wealthy [[Lightfinger (family)|Lightfinger family]].

==Personality==
Donovan was said to have been a [[rogue]] who delighted in tricks and traps.

==History==
Donovan amassed his great wealth through a long career as an [[adventurer]] that took him all over [[Faer√ªn]]. Many of his greatest and most lucrative victories were won against [[fiend]]s and their cultists, with one of his earliest and most notable triumphs occurring in a duel against the [[rakshasa]] known as [[Jurrgal]]. While he reaped the benefits of these battles in his lifetime, he did not always finish his fights, and amassed many enemies who went on to seek vengeance against his family.

He eventually settled into an uneasy retirement in Waterdeep at the head of his newly wealthy family. His descendants would go on to squander his spoils and eventually begin dealing with the same kinds of fiends that he had fought against.
