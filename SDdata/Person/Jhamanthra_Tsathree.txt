==Activities==
Sometime around the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Jhamanthra invented a new scented facial wash she named [[Waterfall Kiss]] and began selling it in her shop. Unbeknownst to her (she claimed), her secret formula caused skin to glow a bright green color hours after certain cosmetics were applied to the same area.
