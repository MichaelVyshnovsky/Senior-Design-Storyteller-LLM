        "History": "Originally a courtier in [[Procalith]], after the previous Magister and crown princess, [[Nasana Melnuthquel]], died of [[heartstop]] as soon as she had slain the queen, Sabral set the body alight with a spell and proclaimed himself the Magister. Immediately, he slew the king, too, declaring himself king of Procalith.\n\nAs king, he quickly had all his rivals, and many powerful warriors, slain in front of him. Then he had a number of magelings rounded up; five were brought to him, while one committed suicide rather than be at his mercy. He quickly sought to ingratiate himself with the five, explaining that his bloody coup was necessary in order to gain the populace's obedience, and naming them his Council. He claimed he meant to become the Magister, and leave it to them to rule Procalith, concerning himself only with preventing them from acting against one other.\n\nHe was found dead days later, with a [[harpoon]] driven through both him and the throne, most likely through the use of a spell. Lady [[Mimr√©]] of the Council thought to claim the mantle of Magister from him, but nothing happened. His Council were all found dead within a tenday."
