'''Nadrathen''', usually know as '''The Rebel Chosen''', was a powerful male [[wizard]]. He was once one of the [[Chosen of Mystra]] but he decided to follow only his will against his goddess and for this he was destroyed by [[Elminster Aumar]].

==History==
Nadrathen, under the name '''Ilgrist''', became the Court Wizard of King [[Baerimgrim]] of [[Galadorna]]. On the king's death in [[764 DR]], faced with the feuds between the kingdom's barons, he nominated himself king. However, he was soon after destroyed by Elminster and [[Mystra|Dasumia]].
