'''Blancheflor''' was one of the Squires of the [[Order of Tye]], an elite organization dedicated to guarding the members of the [[Lords' Alliance]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Squire Blancheflor was a young woman of a notable straightforward demeanor that often made her a natural leader. Even though she lived by the principle that "a knight should face danger with a stout heart and a sturdy shield," her youth and lack of experienced could leave her shaken after facing an overwhelming danger.

When Blancheflor was outfitted for battle, she wore a [[gold]]-tinted [[heavy armor]] and a heavy [[greatsword]].

==History==
By 1372 DR, Squire Blancheflor was a member of the Order of Tye, a knightly order from the city of [[Waterdeep]]. Close to the end of her training, she, along with her fellow Squire [[Launfal]] and Squire [[Camelon]] was sent on the final test - the Knight's Trial, that, if successful, was to elevate the trio to full knighthood. Such trials were rigorous and sometimes suicidal. The trio was sent to slay the vilest and feared creature that laired in the [[Lonely Barrens]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] - the [[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]]. When the squires entered the beast's lair, the sentient [[rat]] lured them deep into the "dining room" inside its cavern and sent a swarm of its kin to devour the young knights.

The squires of the Order of Tye managed to escape the cave. However, the experience left them traumatized, terrified, and panicked. Blancheflor's stoic demeanor was reduced to stuttering, quivering mess. This was when a traveling hero and their allies stumbled across the trio. The [[Hero of Daggerford]] agreed to help Blancheflor slay the horrific creature and eventually successfully ridding the land of MRCD's ferocious swarm. The Hero, however, did not slay the rat. Instead, the creature was convinced to surrender itself to the squires and be taken to Waterdeep as a prisoner.

Squire Blancheflor thanked the Hero, and the trio departed the Lonely Barrens in anticipation of being knighted and treated as valiant heroes.
