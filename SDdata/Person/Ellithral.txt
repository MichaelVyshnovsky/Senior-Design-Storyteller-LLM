'''Ellithral the Golden''' was a [[bard]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1375 DR]].

==Activities==
Usually Ellithral lived inside the [[Yawning Portal]] inn, telling the adventurers all kinds of tales about [[Undermountain]] for a small fee.

==History==
In 1375 DR, Elithral was [[Charm|''charmed'']] by [[Errya Eltorchul]], who ordered him to direct all the adventurers attracted by the dying message of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] to a particular spot in the dungeon with the promise of a map of Undermountain.

==Personality==
Ellithral gained his nickname both for his charisma and his heritage.
