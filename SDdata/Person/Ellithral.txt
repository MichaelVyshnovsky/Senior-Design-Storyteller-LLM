Ellithral the Golden was a bard in Waterdeep in 1375 DR.
Usually Ellithral lived inside the Yawning Portal inn, telling the adventurers all kinds of tales about Undermountain for a small fee.
In 1375 DR, Elithral was charmed by Errya Eltorchul, who ordered him to direct all the adventurers attracted by the dying message of Halaster Blackcloak to a particular spot in the dungeon with the promise of a map of Undermountain.
Ellithral gained his nickname both for his charisma and his heritage.
