Mulcaster Emmarask was a noble in Cormyr and a lord of the Emmarask noble family in the late 15 century DR.
He was "leather-lunged", probably implying the man could surely scream.
He was the head of the Emmarask family.
Around 1479 DR, at the start of the Council of the Dragon, Mulcaster proposed a plan for an eleven-person council, comprised entirely of members of old families like the Illances and the Emmarasks, and notably missing the Obarskyr, Crownsilver, or Truesilver families. He said it was once the will of Alusair Obarskyr, Filfaeril Obarskyr, and Caladnei. However, the ghost of Alusair arrived and, in overt outrage, proclaimed his claim to be false. He accused her of being a fake sent by the War Wizards, instead she responded predictably, by chilling him with her ghostly power. Then things got violent all around.
After the massacre at council, there was a listening spell on him, strongly implying he lived.
Hed been rumored to be plotting to take power with the Goldfeather family, rather than the Illance, and that his chosen king would strip all other families of their titles of nobility, and properties, and then exiled.
