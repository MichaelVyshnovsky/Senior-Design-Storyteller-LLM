'''Mulcaster Emmarask''' was a noble in [[Cormyr]] and a lord of the [[Emmarask]] noble family in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Appearance==
He was "leather-lunged", probably implying the man could surely scream.

==Relationships==
He was the head of the [[Emmarask]] family.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], at the start of the [[Council of the Dragon]], Mulcaster proposed a plan for an eleven-person council, comprised entirely of members of old families like the [[Illance]]s and the Emmarasks, and notably missing the [[Obarskyr]], [[Crownsilver]], or [[Truesilver]] families. He said it was once the will of [[Alusair Obarskyr]], [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]], and [[Caladnei]]. However, the [[ghost]] of Alusair arrived and, in overt outrage, proclaimed his claim to be false. He accused her of being a fake sent by the [[War Wizards]], instead; she responded predictably, by chilling him with her ghostly power. Then things got violent all around.

After the massacre at council, there was a listening spell on him, strongly implying he lived.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|147|16}}

==Rumors==
He'd been rumored to be plotting to take power with the [[Goldfeather]] family, rather than the Illance, and that his chosen king would strip all other families of their titles of nobility, and properties, and then exiled.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|73|8}}
