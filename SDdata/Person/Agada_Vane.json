She had a successful shop that sold metalwork for the home and dry goods. Agada organized weekly tea-parties in order to gossip. Secretly, she was also a personal spy of the Open Lord Dagult Neverember in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.\nAgada was respected by the lords, merchant community, and by the guilds.\nIn 1479 DR, Lord Neverember ordered Agada to keep an eye on Sanfin Lotte, whom the lord distrusted.
