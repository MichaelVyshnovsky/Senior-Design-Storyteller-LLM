'''Callaway''' was a hard-working older [[human]] farmer who lived in [[Gillian's Hill]], a small hamlet along the [[Trade Way]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
Callaway was a hardy worker who spent most of his life under the sun, evidently from his tanned skin. He had a weather-beaten face, gray hair, and bushy sideburns. He tended to talk in a caustic manner as he preferred to work, leaving little time for oratory practice. He also was very superstitious, refusing to talk about strange goings-on or even diseases that plagued the town in 1372 DR. He swished anyone who asked about such things to protect the young ones from such "evil talk."

==History==
''Circa'' 1372 DR, Callaway could be found tending vegetable fiends and [[cow]]s just outside [[Torleth's Treasures]]. He often told strangers off, assuming them to be traveling salesmen.

During the time Gillian's Hill was affected by a strange [[vampirism]]-like plague, the [[Hero of Daggerford]] was asked to investigate the disease. When the adventurers arrived in the hamlet, they met Callaway, asking him about [[Mabda]], a local mad hermit who was thought to have some information on the plague's origins. Callaway thought the old healer woman to be a complete loon, nevertheless helped the heroes to her tent on the edge of Gillian's Hill.
