'''Erron of Candlekeep''' was a traveling researcher and scholar who cataloged magical artifice from across [[Faerûn]] during his travels in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|In my far-ranging travels across the girth of Faerûn, I've come across many locales that claimed to have had some proprietary hold on "the best" [[adventurer]]s and magical artifice. Few cities have had so many facts to back up this type of claim as [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]].|Erron of [[Candlekeep]]}}

==History==
Erron's educational background laid in the sprawling halls of the library-fortress of Candlekeep located on the [[Sword Coast]]. He studied lore and legends of great heroes and fantastic magics for over a decade before embarking on research that led him across numerous locales all over Faerûn. One work of note that came from under Erron's [[quill]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR was a collection of some of the most interesting and alluring [[enchanted]] items used and abused in the city of Ravens Bluff. Erron was in awe, bewildered, and terrified by the recent rich history of the City of Ravens: the war against a mysterious warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]], discovery and destruction of two immensely powerful [[artifact]]s (the ''[[Heart of Bane]]'' and the ''[[orb of protection]]''), and the impressive influx of magic that could rival the land of mages – [[Halruaa]].
