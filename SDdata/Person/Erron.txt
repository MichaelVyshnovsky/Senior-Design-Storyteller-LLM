Erron of Candlekeep was a traveling researcher and scholar who cataloged magical artifice from across Faerûn during his travels in the 14 century DR.
Errons educational background laid in the sprawling halls of the library-fortress of Candlekeep located on the Sword Coast. He studied lore and legends of great heroes and fantastic magics for over a decade before embarking on research that led him across numerous locales all over Faerûn. One work of note that came from under Errons quill in the late 14 century DR was a collection of some of the most interesting and alluring enchanted items used and abused in the city of Ravens Bluff. Erron was in awe, bewildered, and terrified by the recent rich history of the City of Ravens the war against a mysterious warlord Myrkyssa Jelan, discovery and destruction of two immensely powerful artifacts (the Heart of Bane and the orb of protection), and the impressive influx of magic that could rival the land of mages – Halruaa.
