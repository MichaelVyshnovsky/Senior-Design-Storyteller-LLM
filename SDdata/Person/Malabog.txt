'''Malabog''' was the king of the [[fomorian]] giants in the [[Feywild]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. He ruled over his own [[Realm of Malabog|personal domain]] from a [[Malabog's Castle|castle]] that once belonged to the plane's benevolent [[fey]] creatures.

==Possessions==
During his campaign of conquest, Malabog came into possession of an ''[[orb of dragonkind]]'', a powerful item that granted him dominion over the [[blue dragon]] [[Fulminorax]].

Malabog wielded a powerful [[sword]] that was shattered after his defeat, the remains of which were scattered within his castle. The weapon fragments were believed to still hold lingering fomorian magic and could be used to forge powerful weapons.

==Relationships==
The fomorian giant-king commanded an army of [[dark fey]] that wholly committed themselves to his goals. It comprised hordes of [[redcap]]s and [[quickling]]s along with groups of powerful [[cyclops]] warriors. The dark fey army was led by fomorian generals, aided by dark magic provided by a coven of fomorian witches, and their leader [[Magra Curse-Eye]].

Malabog's greatest ally was his black knight and head general, the disgraced elven sentinel [[Celadaine]]. Celadaine once stood as a stalwart foe of the [[Gloaming Court]] before his mind was perverted with dark fomorian magic.

==History==
Malabog was a powerful fomorian giant in the Feywild who at some point became the king of his race. He established his court in a fallen [[fey]] castle, served by a cadre of loyal fomorian warriors and started to expand his dominion.

Malabog decided to enslave the [[elves]] of [[New Sharandar]] and take over the ''[[Fey Crossing]]'' portal to launch an invasion on the [[Prime Material Plane]]. With this objective in mind, Malabog allied himself with the [[lich]] [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] of [[Toril]].

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Iliyanbruen]] elves recruited [[adventurer]]s from [[Neverwinter]] to stop the foul fomorian king. The [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] defeated the fomorian army and sieged Malabog's Castle, putting a stop to Malabog's campaign and slaying the giant king.
