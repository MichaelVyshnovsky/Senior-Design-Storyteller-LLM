The Dwarf domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers useful to dwarves.
For a spellcaster with this domain, their bodys fortitude increased.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the magic weapon, endurance, and glyph of warding spells. Clerics of some experience could cast greater magic weapon, fabricate, and stone tell. Those that were masters of this domain had access to dictum, protection from spells, and earth elemental swarm.
