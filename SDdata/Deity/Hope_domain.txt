The Hope domain was a divine domain that granted hope-themed powers to a divine caster.
The hopes of people took many different forms, like the hope that a current problem would be smoothly resolved for the best the hope that the efforts of the current generation would bear fruit for the future or the hope that a child would grow up and demonstrate wisdom and kindness.
These hopes were reflected in the deities who granted this domain.The "Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms" article in Dragon #378 says that four deities in the Realms offer the 4th-edition Hope domain, but lists only three. This is presumed to be in error. However, the fourth may be Bahamut from the core sourcebook Divine Power, who does have a presence in the Realms.
Angharradh and Chauntea both had hope in the birth of animals and the planting of seeds, viewing new life as full of majesty and potential. Although Chauntea disliked seeing destruction of the natural world, she nevertheless anticipated its regrowth and renewal.
Ilmaters teachings focused on hope, in encouraging his followers to help the suffering, to stand up against tyranny, and to possess enormous spiritual faith. Ilmater persevered and endured, overcoming pain to be a beacon of hope to others.
Bahamut had hope that righteous behavior, upholding honor and justice, would hold back soul-corrupting darkness. His faith was in the soul and in the spirit.
A divine caster with the Hope domain would become more diplomatic. In addition, if they successfully used one of the avenging light, leading strike, righteous brand, or valiant strike prayers, depending on their path, then a nearby ally would have their next strike become more accurate.
Furthermore, one who could channel divinity could employ it when they or a fallen ally were revived after being knocked out. Powered by hope, they briefly became harder to hit and harder to hurt, and more accurate in attack.
