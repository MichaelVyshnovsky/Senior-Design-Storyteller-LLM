        "mainbody": "lebrin Liothiel, called the Celestial Gardener, was a pastoral elven deity of orchards, gardens, nature, and the harvest. He represented the abundance of nature and its ability to provide for those who lived in harmony with it. He was believed to watch over not only elven communities, but the gardens, orchards, and groves that grew near them ornamental gardens and other decorative plantings were also within his purview. He was said to ensure bountiful harvests for those who planted and tended in harmony with nature.\nElebrin typically appeared as a young male elf, wearing a tunic and pants of muted golden shades and cloak the color of spring-green leaves, embroidered with trailing vines. He wore a circlet of leafy vines atop his head and carried a sturdy rowan-wood staff.\nElebrin was a member of the Seldarine, and presumably shared in the rest of that pantheons alliances and enmities.\nHe was known to be served by half-celestial nymphs, half-celestial treants, and celestial chargers.\nThe Celestial Gardener was worshiped by most good elves. His clerics spent their time tending to communal gardens and orchards in elven settlements older clerics would also plan gardens, catalogue new plants, and train plants into decorative shapes. They also studied how to grow crops in harmony, rather than in competition, with native plants.\nMore adventurous followers of Elebrin Liothiel were known to undertake quests involving the restoration of blighted areas, the acquisition of seeds or cuttings from new plants, or helping to feed other elven communities. Some would even help human communities that were stricken with famine or some other misfortune.\nShrines to Elebrin were normally a simple platform built in a tall tree, or a one-room domed or peaked building of saelas wood. All had a simple dirt floor on which neatly tended plants grew. Prayers to the Celestial Gardener normally involved the health of forests and other plants, and requests for sun, rain, or other needed weather conditions. Offerings took the form of a piece of saelas or a live plant.\nClerics had simple rituals they delivered at the occasions of new plantings, harvests from both domestic and wild plants, and forests wherein a new elven community was to be built.\nElebrin Liothiel was said to have created the saelas (wildwood) tree as a gift to the elves."
