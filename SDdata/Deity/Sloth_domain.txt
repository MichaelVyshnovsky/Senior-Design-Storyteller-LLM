The '''Sloth domain''' was a [[deity]] domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and powers related to laziness and indolence. Those with the Sloth domain felt close to their deities when they were relaxing or simply lazing around.{{Cite dragon/323/Seven Deadly Domains|64}}

==Powers==
Priests with the Sloth domain were just as difficult to hit when they were lying on the ground as when they were standing and ready for combat.

==Spells==
Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[touch of fatigue]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', and ''[[deep slumber]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[slow]]'', ''[[symbol of sleep]]'', and ''[[waves of fatigue]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[shadow walk]]'', ''[[waves of exhaustion]]'', and ''[[astral projection]]''.
