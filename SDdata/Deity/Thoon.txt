'''Thoon''' was perhaps a deity or some other entity which was venerated by a specific group of [[mind flayer]]s, or it could have been a guiding philosophy just as well.

==Worshipers==
The mind flayers traveled the [[Underdark]], where they spread the philosophy of Thoon. Along the way, they search for a mysterious substance they call [[quintessence]] which could be found in creatures as well as in raw materials. [[Thoon disciple]]s had access to the [[Evil domain|evil]] and [[War domain|war]] domains and wielded [[heavy flail]]s.

Other "worshipers" of Thoon were the various oddities created by its original followers: [[shadow flayer]]s, [[Thoon infiltrator]]s, [[Thoon thrall]]s, [[madcrafter]]s, all lead by the [[Thoon elder brain]].<ref>

==History==
Not long after the last arrival of an avatar of [[Ilsensine]] in [[Oryndoll]], some mind flayers of the [[Loretaker Creed]] went on a [[pilgrim]]age to the Cavern of Thought in the [[Deep Caverns]]. There was no record if they arrived there or went to some other place, such as the [[Far Realm]]. When they came back to Oryndoll, they proclaimed the belief in Thoon - a doctrine for which they were outcast by the clergy of Ilsensine.
