She was one of the eight Great Gods of the Land of Fate and encouraged hard work and diligent planning in order to harvest the riches of the world. Jisans symbol was a rain cloud, a relic of her long-gone origins as a storm-goddess who provided the monsoon rains necessary for the fertility of the land.\nThere were no tales in which Jisan took any physical form. Like other Zakharan gods, she was above such concerns as alignment, as hard work may be put into an honest life or aimed to subjugate others for personal gain.\nJisans faith was present in all parts of society, but was most prevalent among merchants. She was not worshiped in the Cities of the Pantheon, where her role was taken by the local goddess Jauhar.\nJisan was said to sometimes bestow a great artifact, the Coin of Jisan the Bountiful, to a worshiper of noble intent.\nMain article CategoryTemples to Jisan"
