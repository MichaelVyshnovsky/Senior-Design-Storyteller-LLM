        "mainbody": "The Avarice domain was a suite of spells that were granted by deities whose portfolios concerned covetous greed and unbridled desire for knowledge, wealth, or possessions. Clerics of the Avarice domain gained the ability to sense the most valuable thing in the monetary sense, or at least its direction when they had no visual contact to it, within 30 feet (9 meters) of themselves.\nDuring the latter part of the Era of Upheaval, priests who chose this domain had access to the following spells as they grew stronger. Novice spellcasters were able to use the sticky fingers, treasure scent, and locate object spells. Clerics of some experience could cast shrink item, telekinesis, and Leomunds secret chest. Those that were masters in this domain had access to sequester, discern location, and antipathy."
