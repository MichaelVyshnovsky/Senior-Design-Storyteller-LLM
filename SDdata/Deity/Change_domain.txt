The change domain was a deity domain that was associated with any sort of change, such as evolution or the passing of time.
The goddesses Selûne and Tymora were both part of the change domain, but both had a different view of change. In the eyes of the goddess of the cycles of the moon, Selûne, everything that changed would some day revert. She looked upon change as an ongoing process essential to the world and life itself. Tymora believed everyone should accept the changes that occurred throughout their lifetimes, even minor changes. She also encouraged them to seek out experiences that may change their perspective of the world and the outcome of such change. Lady Luck believed that random change allowed people to grow.
Any divine caster that worshiped a deity who claimed the change domain may have chosen to channel the deitys domain-specific powers. When the caster chose the domain, they became more skilled in thievery. When they used a power that is within the domain, they became more accurate with their attacks shortly after casting.
The powers of this domain were bolstering strike, divine bolts, overwhelming strike, and recovery strike.
Channelling the power of a change domain deity allowed the clerics to transfer effects from themselves to a target, or vice versa.
