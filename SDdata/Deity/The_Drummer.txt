'''The Drummer''' was a [[Zakharan pantheon|savage god]] of [[Zakhara]] worshiped among the isolated islands of the [[Crowded Sea]].

Worshipers of the Drummer called their god by beating large drums made from hollow logs.

==Description==
The Drummer had no physical form and flew through the air when called.

==Abilities==
Unbelievers were at great risk when the Drummer appeared for he could pass into their bodies and gnaw the flesh from their bones.
