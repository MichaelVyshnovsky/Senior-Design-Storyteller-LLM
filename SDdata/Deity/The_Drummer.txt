The Drummer was a savage god of Zakhara worshiped among the isolated islands of the Crowded Sea.
Worshipers of the Drummer called their god by beating large drums made from hollow logs.
The Drummer had no physical form and flew through the air when called.
Unbelievers were at great risk when the Drummer appeared for he could pass into their bodies and gnaw the flesh from their bones.
