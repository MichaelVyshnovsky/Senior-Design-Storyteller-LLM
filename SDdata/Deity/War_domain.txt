The '''War domain''' was a suite of spells that were granted to [[cleric]]s of war deities. The gods were those of chivalry, conquest, destruction, domination, honor, pillage, and war itself. The clerics' abilities and spells focused on battles. These abilities enhanced the combat abilities of the cleric and others. The clerics' repertoire of spells was expanded to include the ones listed below.
