'''Soma''' was an interloper [[deity]] of moons, plants, and prophecies in the [[Vedic pantheon]].<ref group="note" name="reason">There were no known worshipers of Soma in the Realms, particularly [[Malatra]] where some other Vedic powers were worshiped. However, Soma is detailed on this wiki because of her relations with the Faerûnian power Selûne, as detailed in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' and ''[[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|Planes of Chaos]]''.

==Avatar==
The [[avatar]] of Soma generally took the form of a [[giant]] with silver-skin, though at other times he was known to manifest as a bird or [[bull]]. His true form was said to be that of a moon.

==Personality==
This deity was generally a charitable and kind person, but they were also rather proud and vain.

==Abilities==
Rather than calling upon the [[Divine magic|divine spells]] of his [[sphere]]s, the avatar of Soma typically utilized [[arcane spell]]s from the [[:Category:phantasm spells|phantasm]]s sub-school of [[Illusion]].

==Possessions==
Soma carried an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] that caused those struck by it to momentarily become convinced that they were struck dead.

==Realm==
Soma resided on the [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]] layer (or "Asgard") of the [[plane]] of [[Ysgard]], where he shared the [[divine realm]] known as the [[Gates of the Moon]] with [[Selûne]], the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] goddess of [[Selûne (moon)|the moon]] of [[Realmspace]].

==Activities==
With Selune's blessing, the [[petitioner]]s of Soma distilled a juice from special flowers that were dotted around the Gates of the Moon. This juice was rumored to provide insight into the future. Soma also devoted a portion of his time to amassing a collection of beautiful things, for the deity believed that the horde of items reflected well upon his person.

==Relationship==
Much like Selune, Soma was served by both [[lillendi]] and [[lycanthrope]]s. However, unlike Selune, he also commanded a legion of [[asura]]s. These servants of his were rarely seen outside the Gates of the Moon and were unrecognizable to most petitioners in Ysgard.

==Worshipers==
In addition to divine spells from Soma's spheres, his [[priest]]s were provided the spells ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', and ''[[programmed illusion]]''.
