The Community domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers themed around community.
The priest gained the ability to use calm emotions innately once a day, and they also gained a knack for diplomacy.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the bless, status, and prayer spells. Clerics of some experience could cast Rarys telepathic bond, greater status, and heroes feast. Those that were masters of this domain had access to refuge, sympathy, and mass heal.
