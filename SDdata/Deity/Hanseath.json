        "mainbody": "'''Hanseath''' was the [[dwarven]] [[deity]] of carousing, brewery, and singing, representing the more festive side of the Stout Folk. '''The Bearded One''' was also a war god, beloved by berserkers and whose followers were always seemingly off on some kind of crusade.",
        "Description": "Hanseath was known as \"the Bearded One\" for the thick hair that obscured most of his face.",
        "Activities": "Hanseath often ordered his followers to wage war against traditional dwarvish foes, such as [[drow]], [[giants]], [[goblinoids]], or [[orcs]] .",
        "Relationships": "Hanseath's herald was a [[celestial creature|celestial]] dwarf, this servant also being an unimaginably powerful [[barbarian]]. Among his allies were [[death slaad|death]] and [[green slaad]]i, as well as [[howler]]s.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Rituals": "Prayers to Hanseath were, in short, drinking songs; they were often chanted or sung, and many had simple rhyming schemes and frequent, repetitive choruses. His rituals were abundant with food and drink, often appearing to be great feasts, and most were raucous events performed before battle or after victory. The sole exception to this was the Ritual of the Cleft Shield, a rite notable in dwarven culture for being particularly, heartbreakingly solemn. It was performed by followers of Hanseath for a particularly beloved comrade that fell in battle.",
            "Temples": "Hanseath's shrines were great [[festhall]]s, most of which had extensive kitchens and pantries attached, dominated by long tables for worshipers to feast at and raise their goblets to the glory of the Bearded One."
