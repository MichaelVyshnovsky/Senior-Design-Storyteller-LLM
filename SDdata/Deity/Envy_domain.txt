The Envy domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers themed around improving oneself and sabotaging another.
The spellcaster could learn to be a skilled liar and deceiver. Their spells that degraded other peoples abilities or even sapped their vitality were enhanced.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the disguise self, ray of enfeeblement, and touch of idiocy spells. Clerics of some experience could cast vampiric touch, crushing despair, and magic jar. Those that were masters of this domain had access to limited wish, simulacrum, and wish.
