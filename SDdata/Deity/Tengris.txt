'''Tengris''' was a [[Tuigan]] [[deity]] of [[the Sun]].

==History==
According to legends told by the Tuigan, Tengris was pursued by [[Sel√ªne (moon)|the moon]] goddess [[Becal]] after she scorned her nine suitors.

==Worshipers==
It was a custom among the nomadic people of the [[Hordelands]] to not dry clothes in the sun, believing that doing so would offend Tengris.<ref group="note" name="identity">In this passage the authors of ''[[The Horde]]'' only refer vaguely to a "sun god" without providing any name. As we know of no other major sun deities worshipped by the Tuigan, this can be assumed to be Tengris.
