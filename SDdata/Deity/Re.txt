'''Re''' was the former head of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]. As an ancient deity active in multiple [[crystal sphere]]s he was known as '''Ra''', while his manifestation sent to the Realms took the name Re.

==History==
Re died due to injuries he received during the [[Battle of the Gods]] by the [[orc]] deity [[Gruumsh]] during the [[Orcgate Wars]]. As Re died he transferred his power to Horus, who was from then known as [[Horus-Re]].

During the [[Second Sundering]], Re and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of [[demigod]]s and led the [[Mulhorand]]i uprising against the [[Imaskari]], in a manner similar to how the [[Chosen]] manifested in other regions. As of [[1489 DR]], Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people.
