Re was the former head of the Mulhorandi pantheon. As an ancient deity active in multiple crystal spheres he was known as Ra, while his manifestation sent to the Realms took the name Re.
Re died due to injuries he received during the Battle of the Gods by the orc deity Gruumsh during the Orcgate Wars. As Re died he transferred his power to Horus, who was from then known as Horus-Re.
During the Second Sundering, Re and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of demigods and led the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari, in a manner similar to how the Chosen manifested in other regions. As of 1489 DR, Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people.
