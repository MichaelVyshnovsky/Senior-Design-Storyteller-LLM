'''Arvoreen''' ({{Pronounce|ARR|voh|reen|refs=

==Description==
The avatar of Arvoreen appeared as a handsome young muscular halfling dressed in light clothing and chain mail. His weapons of choice ranged from two [[short sword]]s to a short sword and shield. He was always accompanied by a Keeper, and he sometimes appeared to go on patrol with his worshipers.

==Personality==
Arvoreen was strict and preached aggressive watchfulness but only to react to aggression. He didn't support starting conflicts unless it was done to stop evil practices.{{Cite dragon/59/The halfling point of view|53}}

==Relationships==
[[File:YondallasChildren.jpg|thumb|left|Arvoreen (far left) and the halfling pantheon.]]
The Defender's enemies were evil deities such as [[Bane]], [[Cyric]], the [[Deities of Fury]], and the [[goblinoid pantheon]]. His closest allies were the rest of the hin pantheon, especially [[Yondalla]], [[Cyrrollalee]], and [[Urogalan]], but he disapproved of the behavior of [[Brandobaris]].

==Worshipers==
[[File:Arvoreen_symbol.jpg|thumb|left|Holy symbol of Arvoreen.]]
The faith of Arvoreen was strong in like-minded [[strongheart halfling]]s and some isolationist halflings. Devotees followed procedures of military drills, training regimens, and building [[trap]]s, signal beacons, and fortifications. Their temples were specially built keeps. This mix, along with the ideal that the enemies to the hin community mostly came from mixing with other cultures, made them less popular with [[Lightfoot halfling|lightfoots]], who stayed away except in times of war.

The followers of Arvoreen also taught blade-work to the young, especially the deity's favored weapon, the [[short sword]]. The clergy prayed before dawn, before going on patrol. If able, they would also pray before battle with the [[Battle Hymn of the Keepers]], an oral depiction of halfling military victory dating back centuries.

The vestments of the priesthood were silver-colored [[chain mail]] and [[helmet]], along with dark blue [[wikipedia:en:Tabard|tabard]]s with his holy symbol. They also wore an amulet of a small silver buckler.

===Specialist priest and worshipers===
[[File:Demihuman_Deities_-_D&D_2_-_Priest_of_Arvoreen.png|thumb|A priest of Arvoreen.|444x444px]]
Novices of the church were called "Shieldbearers" and the ranks in order of ascent were: Shieldbearer, Warder, Guardian, Defender, Protector, Magistrate, Sheriff, Marshal (full priest), and High Marshal.
* [[Truesword]]s: Specialized priests skilled in fighting with short swords, engineering, and reading and writing.
* [[Keepers (Arvoreen)|Keepers]]: Elite halfing warriors who'd fallen in battle and patrolled the [[Green Fields]] in the [[afterlife]].
* [[Arvoreen's Warders]]: A militaristic branch of the religion with less spellcasting ability, who made up for this drawback with tenacity and skills.{{Cite dragon/321/Faiths of Faerun: Arvoreen's Keepers}}

===Holy Days===
* [[Ceremony of Remembrance]]: This took place during [[Feast of the Moon]], where they remembered those who fell in the defense of the halfling community.

===Affiliated Orders===
* [[Arvoreen's Marchers]]: Known for keeping anarchy from spreading during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]], they then became a recognized knightly order. During this time, they were active in the [[Purple Hills]] under the leadership of [[Estermal Talltankard]]. They gained a chapter-house near [[Barrowsmorn]], called [[Keeperstone]], and they patrolled the [[Purple Marches]].
