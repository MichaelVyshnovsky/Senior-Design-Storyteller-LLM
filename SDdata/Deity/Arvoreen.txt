Arvoreen (
thumb|left|Arvoreen (far left) and the halfling pantheon.
The Defenders enemies were evil deities such as Bane, Cyric, the Deities of Fury, and the goblinoid pantheon. His closest allies were the rest of the hin pantheon, especially Yondalla, Cyrrollalee, and Urogalan, but he disapproved of the behavior of Brandobaris.

The faith of Arvoreen was strong in like-minded strongheart halflings and some isolationist halflings. Devotees followed procedures of military drills, training regimens, and building traps, signal beacons, and fortifications. Their temples were specially built keeps. This mix, along with the ideal that the enemies to the hin community mostly came from mixing with other cultures, made them less popular with lightfoots, who stayed away except in times of war.
The followers of Arvoreen also taught blade-work to the young, especially the deitys favored weapon, the short sword. The clergy prayed before dawn, before going on patrol. If able, they would also pray before battle with the Battle Hymn of the Keepers, an oral depiction of halfling military victory dating back centuries.
The vestments of the priesthood were silver-colored chain mail and helmet, along with dark blue tabards with his holy symbol. They also wore an amulet of a small silver buckler.

* Trueswords Specialized priests skilled in fighting with short swords, engineering, and reading and writing.
* Keepers Elite halfing warriors whod fallen in battle and patrolled the Green Fields in the afterlife.
* Arvoreens Warders A militaristic branch of the religion with less spellcasting ability, who made up for this drawback with tenacity and skills.
* Ceremony of Remembrance This took place during Feast of the Moon, where they remembered those who fell in the defense of the halfling community.
* Arvoreens Marchers Known for keeping anarchy from spreading during the Tethyrian Interregnum, they then became a recognized knightly order. During this time, they were active in the Purple Hills under the leadership of Estermal Talltankard. They gained a chapter-house near Barrowsmorn, called Keeperstone, and they patrolled the Purple Marches.
