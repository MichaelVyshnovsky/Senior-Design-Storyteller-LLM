        "mainbody": "arrrga was a savage god worshiped by the non-Enlightened natives of Jazayir al-Sartan in Zakharas Crowded Seaâ€”human and non-human alike.\nIts special servants, also called its children, were the monstrous sartani, which appeared just like their god a giant humanoid with the head of a crab.\nThe lagoon called Batihat al-Saji in the center of the island group was sacred to Karrrga. Here offerings were placed by his followers, while trespassing non-believers were said to be destroyed. The truth of the matter was that at the bottom of the lagoon a vortex could open to Pandemonium, where the crab god resided."
