'''Malphagor''' was a [[Tanar'ri Prince]] and an upstart deity of the [[undead]] worshiped in the [[Underdark]] region underneath the [[Vast]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Shot in the Dark, Part I|3}}{{Cite organized play/LC/A Shot in the Dark, Part I|10}} and the necromancy portfolio from [[Velsharoon]].

==Description==
Followers of the deity believed that raising the undead was giving them the "Blessing of Malphagor" and the dead individual souls were gifts to the god who, in exchange, gives them eternal unlife. The center of Malphagorian worship was located on the far side of the [[Sea of Endless Darkness]] in relation to [[Ravens Bluff]], about a month's time travel.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Shot in the Dark, Part I|11}}

==History==
Malphagor's cult became a common knowledge after the expedition from [[Ravens Bluff]] descended into the Underdark and established the [[Ravens Deep]] settlement in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}.{{Cite polyhedron/140/Underdark Campaign Journal: Gateway to Ravens Deep|22}} Expedition members ran into several powerful cultists of Malphagor near the [[Watch Post Cavern]], led by [[Filas]], a ranking [[human]] [[lich]] [[priest]] of the upstart deity. The war band under Filas's, leadership consisted of [[Angor]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[death knight]] and its eight dwarven [[skeleton warrior]]s, [[Dannon]], a [[dwarf vampire]], and two of his thralls. The group set out to fight and kill a best of [[beholder]]s and ''[[raise]]'' them as more of the undead followers of Malphagor. Despite their undead existence, the Malphagorians sought no trouble with the living Ravenaar and only wanted a passage to their secret mark. Only if the living were to promise their "destiny" to Malphagor would Filas reveal the group's true goals.{{Cite organized play/LC/On Guard|9-10}}{{Cite organized play/LC/On Guard|3}}

By the late 14{{th}} century DR, relatively recently before 1370 DR, the island town of [[Tradesport]] in the Sea of Endless Darkness faced an undead incursion. Several of the city's Trading Houses used undead workers, who rebelled when an ancient hidden crypt, part of the ancient temple of [[Set]], opened, unleashing its shambling guardians. The unquiet dead began slaughtering everyone in their way, and only with the arrival of Malphagor's priests the undead were pacified and forced under the priests' control. The clergy of Malphagor demanded a section of the city to be given to them as payment. Since then, Malphagor's followers had been an integral part of the city's commerce, trading in the undead servants created from the slaves exported out of [[Thay]]. Inhabitants of Tradesport showed no love for the deity's clergy nor for the god's undead servants.{{Cite organized play/LC/Isle of the End|9-10}} The ''[[Wail of the Banshee]]'', a [[necromancer]]'s ship made of bone, operated out of Tradesport with its master, a [[drow]] necromancer named [[Mezzalcat]] serving Malphagor.{{Cite organized play/LC/Isle of the End|14-16}}

''Circa'' 1370 DR, the [[Cult of the Dragon]], namely [[Shalimarra Daradusk]] of Ravens Bluff, allied with the clergy of Malphagor in the Vast, using the god's priest to help them raise [[white dragon]]s as undead.{{Cite organized play/LC/Rage|13-14}} During the same period of time, powerful priests of Malphagor visited the site of a great battle between drow and [[duergar]] in the Lower Sarbreen to collect bodies of the dead to be risen as servants of their deity. The human lich priest, [[Velcrest]], showed no desire to fight adventurers from Ravens Bluff who came across the grim scavenging and, if left unprovoked, was happy to share information about his patron deity.
