'''Gond''' ({{Pronounce|GAHND|refs=}} {{Pronounce|GOND|alt=yes|audio=Gond.ogg|refs=}}) and as '''Zionil''' in the [[Shining Lands]], was the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[god]] of craft, smithing, and inventiveness. The '''Lord of All Smiths''' had many forms and names, and under all of them pushed for innovation and imaginativeness, sometimes to a dangerous degree, as a result of his short-sighted desire to create.

Gond was also known as '''Nebelun''' ({{Pronounce|NEHB|eh|luhn|refs= The Six Secret Names of Gond were (in appropriate order): '''Aranlaerus''', '''Balateng''', '''Daerosdaeros''', '''Klannauda''', '''Mrangor''', and  '''Tattaba'''.

|Gond
}}

==Description==
[[Avatar]]s of Gond took several forms, including that of a brawny, red-hued smith, a short, slight man with straw-blond hair, or a [[gnome]]. No matter his form, Gond had a forge-scarred face with dark (but nonetheless sharp and bright) eyes and a constantly attentive and inquisitive expression. He wore ordinary leathers under his scorched smith smock, though he could also summon a set of [[glassteel]] [[plate armor]] over himself (hovering close to his body piece by piece rather than actually encasing him) at will.

Gond's manifestations included a forge hammer wrapped with wisps of black smoke, or striking eyes set within dark clouds with the ringing sounds of hammers on [[anvil]]s.

==Personality==
The divine personality of the Wonderbringer was as varied as his desire to innovate was intense. He would at times act wholly disciplined and methodical, while at others become easily distracted. He was just as often insightful and accommodating as he was sardonic or condescending.

Gond remained ever-concerned with making real any theoretical concept or schematic, and held little concern for any complications or problems that arose therefrom. He would readily accept commissions from any unscrupulous patron, so long as compensation was substantial and he was given opportunity to create novel and innovative devices.

Gond was not anti-magic as some may think, but viewed magic as simply another means by which to craft new inventions.

==Abilities==
The god of invention posses immense strength and immunity to any [[firearm]]s, or any weapon that had been crafting by means of smithing, forging or otherwise worked with tools made of [[metal]]. In fact any mundane metal weapon that struck Gond's form, immediately ''[[disintegrate]]d''.

At will, Gond could ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction|disjunct]]'' any nearby [[item enchantment|magical items]].

==Possessions==
Gond possessed a mighty ''[[Hammer of Thunderbolts]]'' called ''[[Craftmaster]]'', that he used both as a tool at his divine forge and (if needed) as a weapon.

==Divine Realm==
Gond's [[divine realm]] was the plane of [[Wonderhome]], which manifested as a grand library in the [[House of Knowledge]] within the [[Outlands]].

==Relationships==
===Deities===

|I thank you again for your assistance, Wonderbringer. You prove there are things better left to the [[hammer]]s of your smiths than the [[spell]]s of my faithful.

Along with [[Milil]], [[Deneir]], and [[Oghma]], Gond was one of the [[Deities of Knowledge and Invention]]. He was on relatively good terms with Oghma, though sometimes their relationship could be tense, due to Gond's tendency to push new inventions being rapidly introduced across Faerûn without thinking of the consequences. Beyond the Deities of Knowledge and Invention, Gond was known to have a friendly rivalry with [[Chauntea]], the Goddess of Bounty, and amiable relationships with [[Lathander]], [[Waukeen]],

He was a friend and ally to many other gods of craftsmanship and invention. He shared bonds with [[Cyrrollalee]] of the [[Yondalla's Children|halfling pantheon]], along with several of the [[Morndinsamman]], including [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], [[Dumathoin]], [[Vergadain]], and even [[Moradin]] the All-Father. Gond shared an especially strong connection to the [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnomish deity]] of smithing, [[Flandal Steelskin]], who maintained a ''[[portal]]'' to Gond's divine realm.

Gond had one major foe among the Faerûnian deities, [[Talos]] the Destroyer.

===Followers===
While Gond was wholly devoted to his mortal followers, he remained too busy at times to answer their prayers in a timely manner. To many this was seen as an appropriate means for Gondar priests to demonstrate their worthiness of his blessing.

At times, he would dispatch [[golem]]s, [[lightning mephit]]s, [[baku]] holy ones, [[einheriar]], [[marut]]s, and even [[steel dragon|steel]] or [[crystal dragon]]s to serve as guides to aid his devotees, or demonstrate his blessing to mortals.

==Activities==
The Wonderbringer constantly worked on new inventions. Gond was credited in legends for the creation of a number of [[artifact]]s. These included the [[Shadowstar]] and the unbreakable leash that bound [[Kezef|Kezef the Chaos Hound]].<ref name="SCAG-p139>

He often spent time sparking inspiration in his most devout followers, or offering them new insights for how existing technology could be otherwise utilized.

Up until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the primary center of Gond worship in the realms was the island nation of [[Lantan]].

The faith of Gond spread far and wide beyond the Sword Coast, to inland cities such as [[Tilverton]] in [[Cormyr]], [[Essembra]] in the [[Dalelands]],{{cite book/The Dalelands|17}} and [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[Vesperin]]. and among a community of gnomes that dwelled within a [[Great Spire of the Ice Sea|solitary isle]] within the [[Yal Tengri]] sea.

Gond was accepted among the gnomish pantheon as Nebelun the Meddler, though a few small groups believed that Nebelun was a separate deity. Though the latter was correct, Nebelun was only active in other [[crystal sphere]]s, leaving the Faerûnian Lord of All Smiths free to take his place in the Realms.<ref>

===Notable Worshipers===
* [[Nadul DaRoni]], a gnome hermit and inventor whose creations were regularly featured for sale in [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].
* [[Torlin Silvershield]], High Artificer of Gond in Baldur's Gate during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Uthlan Abardreth]], the patriarch of Gond in [[Chessenta]].
* [[Zelphar Thann]], Count of Rivershire and Estate Chancellor of [[Tethyr]].

===Temples===
''Main article: [[:Category:Temples to Gond]]''
Gond had various temples throughout Faerûn, such as the grand High House of Wonders in Baldur's Gate. Many temples to Gond were not just ordinary places of worship, but within, machines such as [[internal combustion engine]]s were displayed,{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-06-17 - Internal Combustion Engine}} and vehicles such as [[gondroller]]s were sold.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-05-20 - Gondroller}}

Notable temples to Gond included:
* [[High House of Wonders]], the [[Baldurian]] holy house of Gond that served as an expansive testing grounds and laboratory for the city's Gondar priests.
* [[High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration]], a monastery in [[Illul]] on the isle of Lantan run by the High Artificer [[Danactar]], Most Holy Servant of Gond.
* [[House of Inspired Hands]], one of the largest temples in [[Waterdeep]] led by High Seeker [[Jhoadil Zulthind]].
* [[Turning Wheel|The Turning Wheel]], a prosperous temple to the Wonderbringer found in [[Ravens Bluff]].

==History==
Worship of Gond as Zionel―among practitioners of the [[Adama]]―emerged several years pre-[[Dalereckoning]], in the {{YearlinkName|-256}}.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon were cast down to the mortal realms of [[Toril]] by the Overgod [[Ao]]. Gond's avatar took the form of a [[gnome]] who washed up on the shores of Lantan in the [[Trackless Sea]]. His divinity was quickly recognized by the Lantanna people and Gond was revered for the duration his avatar remained in the Realms.

In recognition and gratitude for their supplication, Gond bestowed upon the people of Lantan the secret for making [[smokepowder]]. This allowed the Lantanna to rapidly begin formulation of firearms, which were continually shipped off to purchasers across the western coast of Faerûn. While worship of Gond grew swiftly in the years that followed, the introduction of these new weapons was viewed as a foreboding change in warfare by leads from across Faerûn.

A mere decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Gond was commissioned by the recently-arisen god [[Cyric]] to commission powerful suits of armor to carry out his own schemes. Cyric armed his inquisitors with these horrific weapons of war and initiated the [[Second Banedeath]] in cities across the [[Heartlands]].
