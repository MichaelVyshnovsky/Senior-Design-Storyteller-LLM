}} was the drow [[demigod|god]] of warriors and battle prowess. His church basically consisted of a military sub-division of [[Lolth]]'s church, In fact, the name associated with those followers of the Spider that Waits—[[Selvetargtlin]]—could be applied without problems to his entire clergy.

==Description==
When sending his [[avatar]], Selvetarm appeared as a large spider, sometimes with the head of a male [[drow]]. He was known to wield a [[heavy mace]], ''[[Venomace]]'',  his favored weapon, in his right hand, and a [[longsword]], ''[[Thalack'velve]]'', in his left hand. He could cast spells from any sphere.

Selvetarm's manifestations were rare because he either ignored pleas or simply sent an avatar. Rare manifestations consisted of tiny sphere of utter darkness, that gradually grew to explode into a ''[[blade barrier]]''. Selvetarm expressed his pleasure through the finding of [[rogue stone]]s, dried [[silverbark]] or [[webstone]]s. His servants included [[myrlochar]]s, [[retriever]]s and other [[spider]]s.

==Personality==
Selvetarm was a ruthless and violent deity, whose only interests consisted of war and spreading destruction. He couldn't find beauty in anything but lethal and efficient combat styles.

He hated everything, including [[Lolth]], to whom he was practically enslaved. Despite this hatred, he was quite dutiful, as well as his freedom to protect her life.

Despite his aggressive traits, he had the capability to be patient to conduct functional ambushes, but frontal wild clashes were his clear preference over anything that required planning and restraint.

He had once a rather uncertain personality, and embraced neither evil nor good. When he met his aunt, [[Eilistraee]], he learned to appreciate her teachings, thus embracing goodness and beauty, but in the end Lolth's trickery turned him into his war-crazed self.(see History)

==Relationships==
===Lolth===
Selvetarm hated [[Lolth]] like everything else. He was bound to her will, Selvetarm himself felt quite comfortable in his subservient role.

Drow scholars speculated Selvetarm was a [[tanar'ri]] lord who was elevated to the position of champion of Lolth during the Time of Troubles, in an attempt to draw male followers from the flocks of Ghaunadaur and Vhaeraun. Other scholars thought Selvetarm might merely be an aspect of Lolth.{{Cite polyhedron/112/Forgotten Deities: Selvetarm|4}}

===Vhaeraun===
He was [[Vhaeraun]]'s and [[Zandilar the Dancer]]'s son but he spurned both his parents, for his mind at that time was too uncertain to commit himself to one direction.

After he became Lolth's servant, father and son became enemies. For example, when Vhaeraun tried to bring the [[draegloth]]s under his faith, Selvetarm's reaction was to compete with the Masked Lord in that regard, with the goal to subsequently give his draegloths followers to Lolth, because he wanted to hinder his father's goal to unseat his grandmother.{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|261-268}} and his submissiveness was a source of rage for the Masked Lord.{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|227-243}}

According to rumors Vhaeraun was the one who granted spells to the priests who worshiped Selvetarm in his own right instead of Selvetarm or Lolth with the goal of instilling in them a sense of independence.

===Other===
He was known to protect [[Garagos]], who was thought to be opting to steal his powers.

He was also an ally of [[Kiaransalee]], who was also in a subservient position to Lolth, in her case out of fear from the Spider Queen's power.

He was also an enemy of [[Sharess]], the goddess who absorbed [[Zandilar the Dancer]], and thus was in a sense, his mother.

After he was found by [[Eilistraee]], they grew close to each other, until he turned into a bloodthirsty monster under Lolth's command and her enemy.

==Worshipers==
[[File:Selvetarm priest.jpg|thumb|250px|''A priest of Selvetarm in the church's ceremonial garb.'']]
His followers consisted of drow and [[aranea]].

Among the [[drow]], as mentioned before, Selvetarm was practically forgotten, and his faith was essentially part of Lolth's church armed wing. His followers in his main center of worship—[[Eryndlyn]]—weren't even allowed to worship him as a [[deity|god]] on his own (rather than Lolth's servant), as the church of Lolth persecuted anyone who did as a heretic. As a general rule, Selvetargtlins trained in martial combat. Practicing Selvetarm's beliefs was somewhat of a career-killer in drow society, for these beliefs didn't put any meaningful emphasis on the intellectual part of combat (like strategy), and thus followers of Selvetarm were rarely put into commanding positions. The drow branch had a gender ratio of about 10:1 in favor of male drow.

His [[aranea]] followers were a different deal. When they talked about Selvetarm, they however referred to his aspect [[Zanassu]]. They put emphasis on craftiness, patience and subtlety.

==History==
===Birth===
Selvetarm was the child of [[Vhaeraun]] and [[Zandilar|Zandilar the Dancer]]. The latter was a [[demigod]]dess of the [[elf|elves]] in [[Yuirwood]]. When Lolth's forces attacked the Yuirwood, Zandilar tried to seduce Vhaeraun into helping her, but was instead imprisoned to be drained of her strength. [[Bast]] saved Zandilar, who willingly merged with her savior (originating a new goddess: [[Sharess]]), giving birth to Selvetarm during the process.

===Becoming Lolth's Servant===
Selvetarm rejected both parents for he was too uncertain to commit himself to one or the other philosophical direction. He wandered for a number of centuries, until he met [[Eilistraee]] and learnt to appreciate her goodness and to admire the Dark Dancer herself. Eilistraee's teachings made him start to embrace the ways of good, and the she hoped that his redemption could improve the relationships between the [[drow]] and the [[Seldarine]] and their followers.

During that time, [[Lolth]] had two problems. She saw a rival in the [[demon lord]] [[Zanassu]], for he challeged her dominion over [[spider]]s, and she was not pleased with Eilistraee getting a friend within the [[Dark Seldarine]]. In order to solve her issues, she approached Selvetarm and tricked him into believing that killing Zanassu would have won him the gratitude of Eilistraee.

That promise was enough to lead Selvetarm to kill Zanassu, but he also absorbed the defeated demon lord's essence in the process. That influence proved too strong for his personality, corrupting him and weakening him enough for Lolth to bind him to her will. The Spider Queen was therefore successful in her plan, and in creating a new enemy for her daughter.

===Time of Troubles===
During the [[Time of Troubles]], Selvetarm's avatar appeared in [[Eryndlyn]]. The avatar raged through the city and was driven back by a coalition of drow who didn't follow Lolth there, while the church of the Spider Queen hailed him as the swordarm of their goddess. This action gave him a small following in the city, but mostly as a military order belonging.

===War of the Spider Queen===
[[File:Vhaeraun and Selvetarm Do Battle.jpg|thumb|left|216px|''Selvetarm and his father, [[Vhaeraun]], duel.'']]

In the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], Lolth went into a state of hibernation, a period called the [[Silence of Lolth]], for about a year. The goal was to transform herself into a [[greater deity]] and turn the [[Demonweb Pits]] into a realm independent from the [[Abyss]].

Selvetarm took the duty of protecting her while she was vulnerable: while Vhaeraun nearly managed to kill his mother, the Champion of Lolth managed to save her life. The battle between the two gods caused some planar turmoils, as the edges of the various planes started to fray and bleed together.

During the Silence, [[Vhaeraun]] also brought a number of [[draegloth]]s under to his [[church of Vhaeraun|church]]. Selvetarm tried to get the draegloths himself to give them to Lolth.

After Lolth's awakening, Selvetarm took part to the ongoing conflict between Lolth and Eilistraee as the Spider Queen's champion, ordering his [[Drow Judicator|Judicators]] to initiate a series of attacks against shrines and communities faithful to Eilistraee.

On [[Nightal 20]], the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Selvetarm tried to strike at the heart of his aunt's forces, as his followers attacked the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]]. However, his attempts ultimately failed: on [[Nightal 20]] of the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]], the defenders of the Promenade bested the assailants, This event later caused his church to be completely absorbed into Lolth's. The Spider Queen claimed that Selvetarm's loss was part of her plan, and Eilistraee too was led to believe it.

===Second Sundering and Rebirth ===
During the 1480s DR, the Overgod [[Ao]] separated the twin worlds [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]] once again and rewrote the [[Tablets of Fate]] (an artifact which contained the name of every deity of the pantheon and their portfolio), in an event known as ''the [[Second Sundering]]''. Because of that, many deities of Toril who were considered dead or lost managed to return to life, Selvetarm among them.

==Relics==
The ''[[Sword of Selvetarm]]'' was a holy sword, which Selvetarm created for his [[Selvetargtlin|followers]].
