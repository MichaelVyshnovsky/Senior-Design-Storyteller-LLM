==Powers==
They also gained the ability to rebuke and command [[ooze]]s much as an evil [[cleric]] could rebuke and command [[undead]].

==Spells==
Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[grease]]'', ''[[melf's acid arrow]]'', and ''[[poison (spell)|poison]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[rusting grasp]]'', ''[[evard's black tentacles]]'', and ''[[transmute rock to mud]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[destruction]]'', ''[[power word, blind]]'', and ''[[implosion]]''.
