'''Selan''' was the goddess of beauty of [[Zakhara]]. She was one of the [[Zakharan pantheon|eight Great Gods]] of the Land of Fate and stood for the beauty that lay in everything. Selan's symbol was a moon within a ring.

The goddess was described as a flawless maiden cloaked in white. Old tales linked her with the moon, which was said to be her [[chariot]]. Like other Zakharan gods she was above such concerns as [[alignment]], as beauty may be craved and valued by [[good]] and [[evil]] folk alike. 

Selan's followers placed much stock in appearances, but also valued inner beauty. They tried to treat everyone with care and to emphasize that which was positive in themselves and others. Many gardeners and artisans were among Selan's worshipers. The bulk of her priesthood consisted of [[ethoist]]s with a mainly traditional outlook. Her most important center of worship was the [[Great Mosque of the Moon]] in [[Medina al-Afyal]].

The [[Faer没nian pantheon|Faer没nian deity]] [[Sel没ne]] was a moon goddess that shared a similar name and outlook with Selan, but had a somewhat different portfolio.<ref> Thus the connection between the two remained a mystery.
