'''Malyk''' was an aspect of [[Talos]] created in the wake of the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] to take advantage of areas of [[wild magic]], created after [[Mystra]]'s death at the hands of [[Helm]]. and embodied rebellion and chaos. He was particularly associated with the rebellion prompted by an uncovered [[wild mage]] given no recourse but to openly attack, and the chaos that then ensued.

==Description==
It was thought by some that Malyk sometimes manifested in the form of the hooded apparitions known as [[wizshade]]s. The incorporeal creatures were created when a spellcaster was caught in their own magical backlash, and since the Dark Mage's appearance had appeared with increasing frequency in the Underdark.

==Realm==
Malyk's realm was located in [[Pandemonium]].

==Relationships==
Lolth obviously resented drow mages being drawn away from her service by Malyk and, knowing that many harbored rebellious thoughts anyway, decided to grant those living in [[Menzoberranzan]] new and powerful arcane spells in an attempt to keep them loyal.

Malyk, attempting to elevate himself at the expense of the [[Seldarine]], had chosen the nearly-forgotten goddess [[Alathrien Druanna]], a goddess of [[conjuration]] and [[runic magic]], as his first target. Unbeknownst to him, the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] god of [[necromancy]] [[Velsharoon]] had done the same, with neither aware that they sought the same quarry. Their efforts had always failed however, only suceeding in rousing the Seldarine and their further protection of the Rune Mistress.{{Cite dragon/251/Magic of the Seldarine|33-35}}

Malyk had also likely paid unwelcomed attention to the elven god [[Darahl Firecloak]], who had been trying to sway more [[neutral]]-aligned members of [[Underdark]] races to his service, and whose even-styled approach to magic conflicted with his own.

==Worshipers==
Malyk had no priests ''per se''; instead, he granted a few divine spells to a few select and powerful [[wild mage]]s. Such "wild priests" advanced as typical wild mages, but could pray for a relatively limited range of priestly spells. It was believed that he granted a kind of ''[[quest]]'' spell to his elite clergy that allowed them to create new [[wild magic zones]] and rumored that on occassion he granted the ability to create [[dead-magic zone]]s.

Wild mages of various races were known to take up the worship of Malyk, ranging from the mad [[dwarven]] offshoots known as the [[derro]] to the renegade arcane [[mind flayers]] called [[alhoon]]. Most of his cultists however were drawn from young drow spellcasters who had been experimenting with wild magic. The drow knew of the Dark Mage's existence through the appearance of wild mages among them, individuals with seemingly random sorcerous powers. 

Unfortunately such individuals were often seen as threats to the established order, and most other drow competed to receive Lolth's blessing by capturing the wild mage. Most who were discovered would be put to death unless they could escape and survive as outcasts; for such a wild mage to survive they would have to defeat or elude their assailants and somehow find a party that could be threatened or bribed into providing sanctuary. 

Drow of low position, especially males, made sacrifices in secret to attract Malyk's attention, but even some house matrons and others steeped in the Lolthite faith made prayers to him for power even as they attempted to purge his worship from their society. Among those wild mages who were found out, a rare few managed to rise to positions of status, declaring their allegiance to Lolth even if they were simply pretending.

===Orders===
The Cult of Malyk around the borders of [[Sshamath]], a drow city where wizards were in power and priests of Lolth held a minor role, had been deemed terrorists by the ruling authorities. The Conclave of Sshamath had long banned wild magic, with wild magic practitioners chafing under their rule since. Several years after Malyk's ascension the Cult attempted a coup using an artifact known as the ''[[Guardian's Tear]]'', an item of raw magic from which bubbles of wild and dead magic spun off. It was for this act that the Conclave, in a rare move of concordance, banished Malyk's cultists along with their venerated artifact. Even so the effects of their plan to ruin the city's economy could still be felt there as wild and dead magic zones drifted undetected and sometimes ruined years of research and effort.<ref>

The Cult of Malyk was known to be led by a mysterious and incredibly powerful male drow, a wild mage known only as the Wildstorm. At least seventeen clergy members were known to have been part of the sect.

Malyk was also known to be worshiped by the drow of the [[Undermountain]].

===Temples===
The Shrine of the Weavetear could be found anywhere around Sshamath, whether in the city or without, for it was located wherever the Guardian's tear spun.

==History==
Malyk was originally an aged and powerful drow lich (said by the Cult of Malyk to have been a Sshamatharan) who lived in the Underdark beneath the [[Dalelands]]. During the Time of Troubles― in the short period after Mystra's death but before [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]]'s apotheosis―he happened across a powerful region of wild magic beneath [[Castle Crag]] and somehow managed to steal a part of Mystra's divine essence from the zone. Unfortunately for the recently ascended Malyk, he was destroyed by [[Tempus]] (who hoped to take some of Mystra's power for himself) before he could consolidate his power, and Talos would later use him as an aspect.

For a time, the mysterious and mostly unknown following of Malyk were believed to be working towards the destabilization of [[Lolth]]-controlled settlements. Priestesses of Lolth who deigned to acknowledge the existence of the Dark Mage expected his swift demise at the Spider Queen's hand, as he was expending his divine power at a reckless rate.

===The Second Sundering===
Malyk was noted to have been reemerged after the [[Second Sundering]], after [[Ao]] reinstated a large number of deities. It was unclear if Malyk was still simply an aspect of Talos or had become an independent divinity again.

==Rumors & Legends==
Malyk and [[Zinzerena]] were in some ways reflections of each other; each for example was a god of [[arcane magic]], but while Malyk was the patron of wild magic, Zinzerena was the goddess of [[illusionist]]s and allowed for magical study. Interpretations of ancient legends suggested that the two were either lovers or siblings.
