The Winter domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers inspired by winter.
During the winter season, the caster was blessed with insight in their skills.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the snowsight, snow walk, and winters embrace spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ice storm, blizzard, and death hail. Those that were masters of this domain had access to control weather, summon giants (frost giants only), and fimbulwinter.
