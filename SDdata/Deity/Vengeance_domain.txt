==Powers==
After the [[Spellplague]], a divine caster with the Vengeance domain would become more intimidating. In addition, when they used certain offensive powers and hit a target enemy, they suffered damage if they subsequently struck the caster or their ally. These powers were ''[[astral seal]]'' (for [[cleric]]s), ''[[avenging light]]'' (for [[Divine soul|invokers]]), ''[[holy strike]]'' (for [[paladin]]s), and ''[[radiant vengeance]]'' (for [[avenger]]s).

==Channel Divinity==
After the Spellplague, the divine caster could [[channel divinity]] to use ''[[small vengeance]]''. If they were badly wounded, they could channel their deity's essence and return the pain to their enemy, injuring them.
