        "Cult": "Vaerae's cult was popular in northern rural [[Calimshan]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]], having been brought to those areas by nomadic tribes that were normally found on the [[Shining Plains]]. These cults held that no snake should ever be injured; the punishment for harming a snake was maiming, and the punishment for killing a snake was being killed in return.",
        "History": "Vaerae was first worshiped during the [[Fifth Age of Calimsham]] in a beast cult amongst nomadic humans; there was also some evidence in the North, found in the [[Farsea Marshes]] and the [[Vast Swamp]], that he was worshiped under the name Repra as well during that time.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], however, Vaerae was severely weakened and subsequently was slain by Sseth, who saw the new aspect as a way to expand his influence and acquire more power in Toril. He granted new powers to Vaerae's priests, and sent [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s from the [[Chultan Peninsula]] to infiltrate and assume control of the cults. The cults proved capable of providing valuable support to yuan-ti agents in the area, and the yuan-ti in turn spread the cult's influence.\n\nOne group of cultists traveled further north in search of [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]]. However, they were all turned into [[ophidian]]s after they accidentally unleashed an artifact that was originally created by [[House Orogoth]]."
