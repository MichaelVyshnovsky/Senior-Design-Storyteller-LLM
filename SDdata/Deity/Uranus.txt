Uranus was a greater power of skies, the progenitor of the greater titans, and the grandfather of the first Olympians. He was widely believed to be a dead power, though there wasnt concrete evidence that he perished.In the context of the Great Wheel cosmology, a lack of evidence as to his demise could mean that there is no presence of his body in the Astral Plane, the graveyard of the gods. There was no evidence of worship for him in the Realms.There were no known worshipers of Uranus in the Realms. However, Uranus is mentioned in the opening pages of the Living City module No Time to Lose. For this reason, Uranus is documented in this article.The source Legends & Lore first presents the idea that Uranus is not truly dead as he was in the ancient myths. The later publication On Hallowed Ground runs with this premise, but makes it more of an indefinite and mystery as to whether or not he is truly still alive. As the former is a generic source and the latter a Planescape source, On Hallowed Ground is given precedence and thus some information from Legends and Lore is presented in this article as indefinite speculation.
Avatars of Uranus took the old and grizzled warriors, with dark eyes that burnt with a desire for revenge.
The disposition of Uranus was marked by cruelty, jealousy, and if still alive as some claimed, he was quite bitter over being overthrown.
The avatars of Uranus had a strong regenerative ability and were impervious to harm from non-magical attacks.
Avatars of Uranus wielded a special sword that could cut through any non-magical material as though it were mere cloth.
According to those that believed Uranus was still alive, he sought to cause harm to his former wife and to spoil any plans of the Olympian powers. His avatar also allegedly would appear to hinder any attempts to free the greater titans or attempts to reach the site where they were imprisoned.
According to the Olympians understanding of how the multiverse came to be, as documented in their the tome the Great Theogony, before everything began there was nothing but an indescribable roiling mass of chaos. From this chaos arose various aspects of nature, During this time, Uranus was created by Gaea and soon after married her.
From their union a powerful race of beings known as the greater titans were created, who by some accounts numbered eleven or twelve in total. Uranus favored the titans above all other children he would come to have with Gaea, giving them special treatment. Some of the children that followed were fair in appearance like the titans, whilst others were far more monstrous, such as the cyclopses and the hecatoncheires. Horrified by their hideousness, to the point that he hated to look upon them, Uranus hid his monstrous progeny away far from the eyes and minds of mortals.
Some accounts told of Uranus locking his progeny up inside Gaeas own earthen depths, causing her pain. Others told of him imprisoning them in the plane of Tartarus. Regardless of where they were imprisoned, his act angered Gaea and over time she grew sickened by the imprisoned state of her children. Gaea convinced one of her children, the greater titan Cronus, to overthrow his father and thus avenge her mistreatment.
Cronus, accepting the goading of his mother, did battle with Uranus and critically wounded him. Blood fell from his wounds upon Gaea, which fertilized her once more and caused the creation of the Furies and the gigantes. The wounded Uranus fled from the battle to the farthest reaches of the multiverse. From there on, it was unclear as to what his fate ultimately was.
Some believed Uranus had died, unable to heal from the injuries inflicted upon him, and became one of the first dead powers in the Astral Plane. However, numerous attempts to search for his body in the Astral came up empty. Because of this, there was fearful speculation among both the greater titans and their progeny, the Olympian powers. Speculation that Uranus may have survived the battle with his oldest son and went into hiding, plotting his eventual return and amassing an army that neither could hope to stand against.
Whatever priests that Uranus had left in the multiverse lived in secrecy, regularly hiring themselves out as fighters whilst using their clerical powers to further the goals of their god. They were proficient in all manner of weaponry and had access to spells from the spheres of astral, combat, divination, healing, protection. Most notably, unlike other clerics, those of Uranus were capable of casting their spells without the use of material, somatic, or verbal components.
