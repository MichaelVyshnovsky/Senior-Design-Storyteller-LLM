'''Jisan''' was the goddess of fruitfulness of [[Zakhara]], who stood for fertility and productivity. She was one of the [[Zakharan pantheon|eight Great Gods]] of the Land of Fate and encouraged hard work and diligent planning in order to harvest the riches of the world. Jisan's symbol was a rain cloud, a relic of her long-gone origins as a storm-goddess who provided the monsoon rains necessary for the fertility of the land.<ref>

There were no tales in which Jisan took any physical form. Like other Zakharan gods, she was above such concerns as alignment, as hard work may be put into an honest life or aimed to subjugate others for personal gain.

Jisan's faith was present in all parts of society, but was most prevalent among merchants. She was not worshiped in the [[Cities of the Pantheon]], where her role was taken by the local goddess [[Jauhar]].

Jisan was said to sometimes bestow a great [[artifact]], the ''[[Coin of Jisan the Bountiful]]'', to a worshiper of noble intent.<ref>
