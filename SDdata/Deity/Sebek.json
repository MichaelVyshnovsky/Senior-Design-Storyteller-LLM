The Lord of Crocodiles was a member of low-standing, yet rivaled only by [[Set]] in his wickedness.",
        "Description": "Sebek usually appeared in one of two forms. The first, known as the \"Lord of Crocodiles\", was that of a [[Mulan]] man possessing the head of a [[crocodile]]. This form typically wore a horned and plumed headdress. The second form, known as the \"Smiling Death\", was that of a giant crocodile. The appearance of a giant crocodile's smile was used a sign of favor and disfavor.",
        "Personality": "Sebek delighted in devouring humans, but could be convinced not to through obsequious begging and offerings of even greater meals.",
        "Powers": "Sebek was able to summon and control crocodiles at will, and has been known to swallow boats and living creatures whole.",
        "Activities": "Before the [[Spellplague]], Sebek rarely manifested in the material world, usually sending his avatar to hunt.",
        "Relationships": "Sebek was an outcast in the eyes of the rest of the Mulhorandi pantheon, though he was known for occasionally being ally of his father, Set.",

Upon the city's destruction, the clergy relocated to the [[Adder Swamp]] of Chessenta. No temples dedicated to the \"Smiling Death\" were known to exist as of [[1358 DR]].",
            "Orders": "All werecrocodiles followed Sebek, though no organizations were known to be sponsored by the church.",
            "Celebrations": "Monthly offerings of meat were dedicated to Sebek in order to ward off crocodile attacks.\n\nPriests of Sebek had to kill a sentient creature monthly, as well as create at least one new werecrocodile from among the humans living in Mulhorand each year."

        "History": "Sebek was the son of an ancient manifestation of the Mulhorandi [[god]] [[Set]] and a bestial [[archfey]] of the [[Feywild]] known as [[Mornach]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1183}}, the largest sect of Sebek's worshipers were expelled from [[Mulhorand]] by the [[Brotherhood of Those Who Smile in the Face of Death]]. They resettled in [[Chessenta]].\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], Sebek battled Malar's avatar in the Adder Swamp in a titanic struggle that destroyed large areas of the region.This source states that Malar slew Sebek and assumed control of his cult. However, sourcebooks including ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' and ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'' directly contradict the claim that Sebek was killed or replaced.\n\nIn the late years of the 15th century [[DR]], some rumors said that Sebek was living in the [[Adder Swamp]]{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|72}}"
