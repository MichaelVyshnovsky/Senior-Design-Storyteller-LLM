As the embodiment of the great Nogaro, Shajar represented both its benevolent, life-giving qualities and the destructive character present during the river's recurring floods. Thus the deity was called upon at births and deaths.<br/>\n\nThe greatest [[relic]] of his [[Cult of Shajar|cult]] was the [[Talisman of Shajar]]."
