        "mainbody": "ung Chiang (, in order to protect the beautiful nature of the Shao Mountains, Nung Chiang threatened the construction of a highway and caused the volcano of Mount Tengkorak to erupt, destroying the city of Tempat Larang, a colony of Anok-Imaskar.The Grand History of the Realms page 33 says Kujawa died in combat with \"the celestial dragon Tien Lung\". However, a \"tien lung\" is a generic type of oriental dragon with a name meaning \"celestial dragon\" this name may be in error. Ronin Challenge tells that Nung Chiang opposed the empires expansion into Tempat Larang, even triggering the Mount Tengkorak eruption. Furthermore, Nung Chiang manifests as a tien lung in the module, and is mentioned to also appear as a spirit dragon. Page 67 presents a story by Awagi Nukichi retelling the fall of Emperor Tan Chin (there called Joon Tsao Choo) at Kuo Meilan to an unnamed \"spirit dragon\" and appends a disaster striking Tempat Larang (presumably the volcano in the same book) a few years afterward. However, Grand History later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawas death 170 years later, and Tan Chins empire centuries after that, with Tan Chin defeated by Chih Shih as normal. Thus, in-universe, Awagis story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and its not clear what it might say about Kujawa and Anok-Imaskar, and who killed Kujawa. While it is possible that Nung Chiang is Tien Lung, no source confirms that Nung Chiang killed any emperor. Page 33 of The Grand History of the Realms also notes that Chan Cheng was the first of the Nine Immortals, suggesting Nung Chiang wasnt an Immortal previously.\nAfterward, he always watched over the ruined city, which was full of dark spirits. In 1358 DR, he noticed first Governor Kawabi and later General Goyat Nagumo trying to use the power of Tempat Larangs stone spirits. So Nung Chiang manipulated and helped an adventuring party to stop the menace. As a back-up plan, he was ready to activate Mount Tengkorak again, despite the fact his fellow Immortals would severely punish him for intervening in mortal business.\nAs one of the Nine Immortals, Nung Chiang had two forms one was as a vast dragon, the other was a man, always dressed as a farmer and wearing worn sandals and carrying a long pole loaded with goods for market.\nAs one of the Nine Immortals, Nung Chiang served the Celestial Emperor directly, and stood beside his throne, ready to serve his will.\nAs one of the Nine Great Dragons, Nung Chiang helped hold up the world, and could move all things with his mind.\nIn the Emperors name, the Nine Immortals administered and directed all the Lesser Immortals of the Celestial Empire. In particular, Nung Chiang commanded the Rice Spirits, who had the duties of causing rice to grow, animals to have their young, and women to bear babies, and decided if a family should have children.\nNung Chiang personally answered to people that prayed to him at special golden shrines with jade altars that he had spread across the land.\nHe had always paid special attention to the Shao Mountains.\nNung Chiang was venerated by almost all peasants, especially farmers, of Shou Lung at all the rural shrines of the country. They prayed to him in order to have good harvests and fair weather.\nNung Chiang was the patron of the White Tiger Monastery.\nA holy day in the month of Chuang was dedicated to the god of land and grain.\nHe had a small realm in the Spirit World of the Celestial Bureaucracy.\nNung Chiang also had a refuge in the material plane in the Shao Mountains at the Sumitra Tower on the road that split the Kumandang Valley. There, he was harassed by the requests of local inhabitants who asked for his help for all kinds of misfortunes."
