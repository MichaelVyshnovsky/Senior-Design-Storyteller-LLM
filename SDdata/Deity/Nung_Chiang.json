        "History": {
            "The immortal": "According to the legendary history of [[Kara-Tur]], shortly after the beginning of the world and [[human]]kind, the Celestial Emperor sent his great emissaries among the people, with each to teach one aspect of the True Path of Enlightenment. Nung Chiang was one of these emissaries.\n\nIn the legend, nine tired travelers stopped at a poor remote inn in the dead of winter, and the innkeeper lamented he had no more food to spare. So, despite their tiredness, four went to hunt for game, four went to forage, and the last cooked a meal for the travelers, the innkeeper, and his family. Afterward, they preserved the remainder of the food to see the folk through the rest of winter. Overjoyed, the innkeeper made a gift, and a revelation—he was no mortal but the last of the old gods of the land, and he gave the land to the nine to rule. Afterward, these Nine Travelers became the Nine Great Sovereigns, and they ruled Shou Lung for thirty cycles of years. They became the first emperors of Shou Lung, and were recorded in legend as the \"Nine Immortals\".\n\nFinally, the Nine Great Sovereigns, dressed as ordinary travelers, returned to the site of the inn, but found only a simple peasant's hut. The peasant, [[Nung Fu]], welcomed them in and fed them freely, though it was the depths of winter and he had little to spare. Afterward, these Nine Travelers offered a gift in exchange for this hospitality, and presented Nung Fu with the [[Emblems of Authority]]. They took him to their courts, investing him as emperor of Shou Lung. This marked the start of the [[Third Age of Shou Lung]], the beginning of the calendar in [[-1250 DR|Shou Year 0 (−1250 DR)]].\n\nThe Nine Great Sovereigns were then the Nine Travelers once more. The tales disagree as to what became of them after that. According to some, they simply faded away. To others, they went with the gods into the heavens. More told that the Nine Travelers still wandered Shou Lung to ensure that rulers respected the memory of Nung Fu, and that innkeepers took good care of their guests.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-2113}}, in order to protect the beautiful nature of the [[Shao Mountains]], Nung Chiang threatened the construction of a highway and caused the volcano of [[Mount Tengkorak]] to erupt, destroying the city of [[Tempat Larang]], a colony of [[Anok-Imaskar]].<ref group=\"note\">''The Grand History of the Realms'' page 33 says Kujawa died in combat with \"the celestial dragon [[T'ien Lung (individual)|T'ien Lung]]\". However, a \"[[t'ien lung]]\" is a generic type of [[oriental dragon]] with a name meaning \"celestial dragon\"; this name may be in error. ''Ronin Challenge'' tells that Nung Chiang opposed the empire's expansion into Tempat Larang, even triggering the Mount Tengkorak eruption. Furthermore, Nung Chiang manifests as a t'ien lung in the module, and is mentioned to also appear as a [[shen lung|spirit dragon]]. Page 67 presents a story by [[Awagi Nukichi]] retelling the fall of Emperor [[Tan Chin]] (there called [[Joon Tsao Choo]]) at [[Kuo Meilan]] to an unnamed \"spirit dragon\" and appends a disaster striking Tempat Larang (presumably the volcano in the same book) a few years afterward. However, ''Grand History'' later retconned this, inventing the much-earlier Anok-Imaskar, placing the settlement and destruction of Tempat Larang within its time, Kujawa's death 170 years later, and Tan Chin's empire centuries after that, with Tan Chin defeated by [[Chih Shih]] as normal. Thus, in-universe, Awagi's story appears to be a mistaken conflation of the falls of both empires and it's not clear what it might say about Kujawa and Anok-Imaskar, and who killed Kujawa. While it is possible that Nung Chiang ''is'' T'ien Lung, no source confirms that Nung Chiang killed any emperor. Page 33 of ''The Grand History of the Realms'' also notes that [[Chan Cheng]] was the first of the Nine Immortals, suggesting Nung Chiang wasn't an Immortal previously.\n\nAfterward, he always watched over the ruined city, which was full of dark spirits. In [[1358 DR]], he noticed first Governor [[Kawabi]] and later General [[Goyat Nagumo]] trying to use the power of Tempat Larang's [[stone spirit]]s. So Nung Chiang manipulated and helped an adventuring party to stop the menace. As a back-up plan, he was ready to activate Mount Tengkorak again, despite the fact his fellow Immortals would severely punish him for intervening in mortal business."

In particular, Nung Chiang commanded the [[Rice Spirits]], who had the duties of causing rice to grow, animals to have their young, and women to bear babies, and decided if a family should have children.\n\nNung Chiang personally answered to people that prayed to him at special golden shrines with [[jade]] altars that he had spread across the land.\n\nHe had always paid special attention to the [[Shao Mountains]].",
