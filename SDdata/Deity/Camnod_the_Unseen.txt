Camnod the Unseen was one of seven [[demipower]]s who were defeated by or submitted to the god [[Bane]], the Black Lord, in ancient times, among [[Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud]]; [[Maram of the Great Spear]]; [[Haask, Voice of Hargut]]; [[Tyranthraxus|Tyranthraxus the Flamed One]]; and two more whose names were lost to history. In ''[[Urgund's Description of Darkness]]'', an account by [[Urgund]] of his imprisonment in the [[lower planes]], these five entities were "those who fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane" and later sat in his Hall of Minor Courtiers as [[lesser power]]s.
