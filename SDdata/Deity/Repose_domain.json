        "mainbody": "'''Repose domain''' was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with death-related [[spell]]s and powers. It was similar to the [[Death domain]], but existed for those good-aligned deities of death who could not give their clerics access to evil spells.",

        "Powers": "Once a day, the spellcaster could kill a target instantly with but a touch, though the difficulty was affected by both the skill of the user and the strength of the target.",
        "Spells": "Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[deathwatch]]'', ''[[gentle repose]]'', and ''[[speak with dead]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[death ward (spell)|death ward]]'', ''[[slay living]]'', and ''[[undeath to death]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[destruction]]'', ''[[surelife]]'', and ''[[wail of the banshee]]''."
