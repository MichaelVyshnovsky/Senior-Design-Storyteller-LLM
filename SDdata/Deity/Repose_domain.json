        "mainbody": "he Repose domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with death-related spells and powers. It was similar to the Death domain, but existed for those good-aligned deities of death who could not give their clerics access to evil spells.\nOnce a day, the spellcaster could kill a target instantly with but a touch, though the difficulty was affected by both the skill of the user and the strength of the target.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the deathwatch, gentle repose, and speak with dead spells. Clerics of some experience could cast death ward, slay living, and undeath to death. Those that were masters of this domain had access to destruction, surelife, and wail of the banshee."
