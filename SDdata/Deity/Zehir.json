        "History": "Zehir was [[Set]], a member of another pantheon<ref> who managed to join the Faer√ªnian one under a different name.\n\n[[Dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]] believed that Zehir had part in [[Asgorath]]'s death during the [[Dawn War]]. Those who believed that myth, said that Zehir wanted to control the [[Dragon domain]] that was Asgorath's [[portfolio]], and betrayed him to the primordial [[Erek-Hus]] in order to obtain it. His plan failed when the gods [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]] rose up from the [[dragon]] god's corpse, and claimed Asgorath's power over dragonkind.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], Zehir, commanding the [[yuan-ti]] [[House Se'Sehen]], planned to take control of the [[Chultan Peninsula]] and the [[Sword Coast North]]. Adventurers working with [[House Sauringar]]'s leader [[Sa'Sani]] defeated his herald, a powerfully built giant [[yuan-ti abomination]] wearing a headdress, and then got the chance to converse with the deity, appearing as two huge, red floating eyes set in scaly sockets and with feathery eyebrows. The voice that issued forth from this apparition was calm and confident. Despite the fact that his plan was ruined, he revealed that it was but one of many schemes that he was sponsoring all over the world. The [[aasimar]] [[Shadow Thieves|Shadow Thief]] [[Belueth the Calm]], who had traveled with the adventuring party that defeated the herald, took to hunting and killing his [[Snaketongue cult]]ists following these events."
