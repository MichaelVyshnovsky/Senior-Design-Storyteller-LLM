The Humility domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with humility-related spells and powers. All divination-school spells that they could cast were more effective, as if they had much more experience with casting such spells.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the reduce person, hold person, and bestow curse spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ray of exhaustion, enervation, and waves of fatigue. Those that were masters of this domain had access to symbol of weakness, spell turning, and energy drain.
