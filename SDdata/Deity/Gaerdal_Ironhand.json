As such, he was honored in some manner by nearly all [[good]]-[[alignment|aligned]] [[gnome]]s, and one or two [[crusader]]s of his could be found in most sizable settlements. His symbol was an iron band, usually worn on the upper left arm, and his preferred weapon was the [[warhammer]] [[Hammersong]].",
        "Personality": "Gaerdal was the sternest and most serious of gnome deities.",
        "Realm": "Gaerdal resided in the [[Golden Hills]], inside [[Dothion]], which was found in [[Bytopia]] (''also known as the [[Twin Paradises]]'').",
        "Relationships": "Gaerdal Ironhand had good relations with most of the other gnomish gods with the exception of [[Urdlen]].  He disliked [[Baervan Wildwanderer]] because of his tendency to pull pranks. He was hostile toward the [[kobold]] and [[goblin]] pantheons.",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:Gaerdal Ironhand cleric.png|thumb|''A cleric of [[Gaerdal Ironhand]].'']]\nGaerdal's church was organized as a strict military hierarchy. Although temples of Gaerdal Ironhand were rare, [[cleric]]s built statues of Gaerdal at the entrance of gnomish settlements.\n\nPriests of Gaerdal prayed at dawn. They called [[tenday]]s \"Tenhammers\", after a custom of striking a metal [[shield]] with a large [[hammer]] at the end of each day and because ten days was a typical duration of guard duty for followers of Gaerdal. After ten Tenhammers, the final day was considered a holy day known as a Great Clang and believers would assemble to sing hymns and chants."
