        "Description": "He appeared as a powerful warrior clad in golden armor, wielding sword or spear and mounted upon a demonic steed. He wore his armor at all times in order to ward off warfare.",
        "Activities": "He was known to look after his followers in times of war.",
        "Personality": "His favorite scent was [[lemon]] blossoms.",
        "Legends": "When the [[samurai]] general [[Kuma-shi]] prayed to the Wide Hearing for relief after his troops were slaughtered by a [[Shou Lung]] invasion force, Bishamon directed him to fire an arrow into a rock. He did so, and a fountain gushed forth, bringing water to the thirsty and weary soldiers. Invigorated, Kuma-shi finally pushed back the invaders. The fountain continued to flow, and those who drunk from it were believed to receive miracles from Bishamon.\n\nIn front of the Shining Temple of Bishamon stood a soaring [[apple]] tree whose fruit were said to bestow immortality on the deserving, and death to the wicked, but only Bishamon could pick them.",
        "Notable Shrines & Temples": "* The [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] in [[Aru]]. The center of the faith and favored by commoners and peasants, people made pilgrimages here from across the country.\n* The [[Great Temple of Bishamon]] in [[Kurahito]]. The favored temple of the nobility and upper classes and site of the Fountain of Kuma-shi.\n* [[Ojichizu]]: A {{SIAdj|75|ft|long=yes|adj=high}} [[granite]] statue of Bishamon was buried to its neck in solid rock after the [[Mount Matazan]] eruption."
