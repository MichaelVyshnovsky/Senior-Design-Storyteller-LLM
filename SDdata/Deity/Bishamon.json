        "mainbody": "Bishamon, the Wide Hearing, was a spirit who was guardian of northern Wa and the most loved by the Wanese people. He was a god of happiness through good cheer. He was one of the Eight Million Gods.\nHe appeared as a powerful warrior clad in golden armor, wielding sword or spear and mounted upon a demonic steed. He wore his armor at all times in order to ward off warfare.\nHe was known to look after his followers in times of war.\nHis favorite scent was lemon blossoms.\nWhen the samurai general Kuma-shi prayed to the Wide Hearing for relief after his troops were slaughtered by a Shou Lung invasion force, Bishamon directed him to fire an arrow into a rock. He did so, and a fountain gushed forth, bringing water to the thirsty and weary soldiers. Invigorated, Kuma-shi finally pushed back the invaders. The fountain continued to flow, and those who drunk from it were believed to receive miracles from Bishamon.\nIn front of the Shining Temple of Bishamon stood a soaring apple tree whose fruit were said to bestow immortality on the deserving, and death to the wicked, but only Bishamon could pick them.\n* The Shining Temple of Bishamon in Aru. The center of the faith and favored by commoners and peasants, people made pilgrimages here from across the country.\n* The Great Temple of Bishamon in Kurahito. The favored temple of the nobility and upper classes and site of the Fountain of Kuma-shi.\n* Ojichizu A  granite statue of Bishamon was buried to its neck in solid rock after the Mount Matazan eruption."
