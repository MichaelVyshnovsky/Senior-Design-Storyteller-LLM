The Dream domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics access to dream- and mind-related spells and powers.
Because they were experienced in analyzing dreams and nightmares, priests with this domain were immune to fear.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the sleep, augury, and deep slumber spells. Clerics of some experience could cast phantasmal killer, nightmare, and dream sight. Those that were masters of this domain had access to greater scrying, power word, stun, and weird.
