        "mainbody": "She who forever walks (by the people of Hafoka)\nCheeah was a demigoddess worshiped by the saru of the Malatran Plateau, considered by them to be their matron mother and teacher.\nCheeah held concern for the well-being of the jungles of the Plateau in general.\nCheeah made her home on the Prime Material. She roamed the jungles of the Malatran Plateau,\nThe priesthood of Cheeah was small in number and made up entirely of saru women. Whenever a saru woman felt the \"calling,\" as they put it, she would leave her clan and seek out their deity. It was said that those who managed to find Cheeah would return to their clan, having been bestowed clerical powers, though very few ever actually saw her in person. Shamans of Cheeah also became rather reclusive and private individuals.\nThose who did see Cheeah in person could become \"Touched\", a state that attracted hundreds of nature spirits to them. The spirits would clamor around the shaman, demanding attention and offering all kinds of boons for a period averaging around two to eight days, and those who didnt know how to handle this clamor would eventually go mad. Additionally, being visited by the goddess was sometimes considered an omen that a great sacrifice was to be needed.\nOutside of the saru, Cheeah was little known of by the other races that inhabited the Malatran Plateau. One exception to this were the jungle giants of Hafoka, who claim that the founders of their village made peace with She-Who-Walks."
