        "mainbody": "he Mentalism domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers based around mentalism.\nA priest with this domain could use abjuration magic to temporarily ward their mind or the mind of another against external effects, giving them the will to resist. It lasted one hour and could be done once a day.\nAs they advanced, a priest with this domain could cause a foe to act randomly with lesser confusion, to read minds with detect thoughts, to see or hear from afar with clairaudience/clairvoyance, to modify memory, to distract others with a mind fog, to communicate with allies via a Rarys telepathic bond, to repel creatures with antipathy, to shield a mind with mind blank, and finally to voyage to the Astral Plane using astral projection."
