        "mainbody": "he Renewal domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to renewal.\nThe first time in a day that a spellcaster with this domain was knocked unconscious and dying through injury, he or she partially regenerated health, possibly enough to regain consciousness.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the charm person, lesser restoration, and remove disease spells. Clerics of some experience could cast reincarnate, atonement, and heroes feast. Those that were masters of this domain had access to greater restoration, polymorph any object, and freedom."
