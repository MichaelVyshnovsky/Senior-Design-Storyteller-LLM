        "mainbody": "The Great White Bear was a totem spirit worshiped by the Ice Hunters.\nIt was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped him to eat polar bear meat or fat, wear anything made from polar bear, or otherwise harm a polar bear. However, those shamans that worshiped him could call upon polar fury once each day, summon polar bears to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a polar bear twice each tenday.\nAdditionally, iceguardians who revered the Great White Bear alongside Ulutiu also could call upon polar fury once each day."
