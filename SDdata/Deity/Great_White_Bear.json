        "mainbody": "The '''Great White Bear''' was a totem spirit worshiped by the [[Ice Hunters]].\n\nIt was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped him to eat [[polar bear]] meat or fat, wear anything made from polar bear, or otherwise harm a polar bear. However, those shamans that worshiped him could call upon ''[[polar fury]]'' once each day, summon polar bears to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a polar bear twice each tenday.\n\nAdditionally, [[iceguardian]]s who revered the Great White Bear alongside [[Ulutiu]] also could call upon ''polar fury'' once each day."
