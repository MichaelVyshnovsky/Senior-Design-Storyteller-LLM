        "mainbody": "Clever Oomio the Grey Seal was a totem spirit worshiped by the Ice Hunters.\nIt was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped him to eat seal meat or fat, wear anything made from seal, or otherwise harm a seal. However, those shamans that worshiped him could call upon selkie form once each day, summon seals to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a seal twice each tenday.\nAdditionally, iceguardians who revered Clever Oomio alongside Ulutiu also could call upon selkie form once each day."
