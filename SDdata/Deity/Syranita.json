        "Abilities": "In avatar form, Syranita could see perfectly within a range of {{SI|4|mi|k|long=yes}}. She was very watchful and skilled at spying.\n\nThe opal necklace she wore protected her from evil.

        "Relationships": "Syranita tried to be friends with as many gods as possible, including [[human]] sky gods like [[Akadi]]. She was also an ally of [[Deep Sashelas]] and other members of the asathalfinare as she sought to create friendship for her relatively weak race.<ref>"
