On a favored worshiper, the radiance could provide the benefits of spells such as barkskin, locate animals or plants, pass without trace, plant door, or speak with plants. It could also animate a tree as a treant for around an hour, function as some version of spike growth, entangle, and plant growth, or coalesce into a handful of goodberries. \nBaervan was known to deliver omens in the form of a whispering wind in the trees. He conveyed his favor by permitting his faithful to discover acorns, bits of amber, emeralds, oak leaves or the sudden growth of plants in a peculiar place along a well-trodden trail. Conversely, his displeasure was shown by causing a tree branch to gently strike the target of his disaffection or by causing small animals to behave oddly (like pelting a gnome with acorns).\nBaervan was a gentle guardian of the wild with a passion for oak trees and a love for all forest animals. He was a carefree deity. and lacking his dedication or finesse. He too was a mischievous but amiable god with a strong penchant for good-natured pranks and jests, Despite his practical joking, it was difficult to dislike Baervan, and unlike typical gnomish shenanigans they were often designed to serve a purpose.\nBaervan lived in the gnomish realm of the Golden Hills.\nthumb|Holy Symbol of Baervan Wildwanderer.thumb|Baervan and Chikktika (left) acompanied by left\nBaervans closest friend was Chiktikka Fastpaws, a sentient giant raccoon. His superior was Garl Glittergold. Baervan considered Segojan Earthcaller, Brandobaris, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Gwaeron Windstrom and other good nature deities among his allies.  Urdlen and Malar were particularly hated enemies.\nBaervans clerics wore wood-brown cloths and green caps. They worshiped Baervan in forest clearings while sacrificing treasure items to him monthly.\nHis sacred animal was the raccoon and his holy days were on the full moon."
