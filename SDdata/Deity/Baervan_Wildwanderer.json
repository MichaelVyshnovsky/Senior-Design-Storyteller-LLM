            "Manifestations": "Baervan might manifest as an amber radiance that settles over a worshiper or plant and induces a magical effect. On a favored worshiper, the radiance could provide the benefits of spells such as ''[[barkskin]]'', ''[[locate animals or plants]]'', ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[plant door]]'', or ''[[speak with plants]]''. It could also ''[[animate tree|animate a tree]]'' as a [[treant]] for around an hour, function as some version of ''[[spike growth]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', and ''[[plant growth]]'', or coalesce into a handful of [[Goodberry|goodberries]]. \n\nBaervan was known to deliver omens in the form of a whispering wind in the trees. He conveyed his favor by permitting his faithful to discover acorns, bits of [[amber]], [[emerald]]s, oak leaves or the sudden growth of plants in a peculiar place along a well-trodden trail. Conversely, his displeasure was shown by causing a tree branch to gently strike the target of his disaffection or by causing small animals to behave oddly (like pelting a gnome with acorns)."
        },
        "Personality": "Baervan was a gentle guardian of the wild with a passion for oak trees and a love for all forest animals. He was a carefree deity. and lacking his dedication or finesse. He too was a mischievous but amiable god with a strong penchant for good-natured pranks and jests,{{Cite dragon/61/Gods of the Gnomes|31-33}} Despite his practical joking, it was difficult to dislike Baervan, and unlike typical gnomish shenanigans they were often designed to serve a purpose.",
        "Realm": "Baervan lived in the gnomish realm of the [[Golden Hills]].",

His superior was [[Garl Glittergold]]. Baervan considered [[Segojan Earthcaller]], [[Brandobaris]], [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], [[Gwaeron Windstrom]] and other good nature deities among his allies.  [[Urdlen]] and [[Malar]] were particularly hated enemies.",
