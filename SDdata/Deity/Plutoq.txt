'''Plutoq''' was the Maztican god of stone and mountains.

==Appearance==
Plutoq appeared as a towering pillar of soil and stone some forty or fifty feet tall. He had green jade for eyes and spikes of obsidian for teeth.
==History==
Plutoq was the youngest son of [[Kukul]] and [[Maztica (goddess)|Maztica]]. Like his brothers Azul and Tezca, he sided with [[Zaltec]] against [[Qotal]].
==Worship==
Plutoq was less popular than other gods in Maztica. He was only prayed to when fields were barren and prayers to [[Watil]] had failed, or when safe passage over the mountain areas above the tree line was sought. He had few priests, who dedicated themselves to working with stone, clay, or gems. Sacrifices to him took the form of shattering pottery or even jewelry on the ground.
