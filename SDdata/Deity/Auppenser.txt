'''Auppenser'''<ref group="note">Auppenser was created by Ed Bonny for ''[[Lost Empires of Faer√ªn]]'', but little was said about him in the official publication. Ed did, however, provide additional fluff and crunch over at the Candlekeep forums found [http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3690&whichpage=2&SearchTerms=Auppenser here]. was a stoic god, and the precepts of his worship included moderation, inner balance, self-reflection, and reason.

==Relationships==
His church reached its heights in [[Jhaamdath]] - primarily in the [[Twelve Cities of Swords]] - before its imperial expansion. At this time in Jhaamdath, the Twelve Cities were ruled by a psiocracy of [[bladelord]]s ([[cleric]] [[psion]]s) who considered the perfection of both mind and body of the highest importance.

==History==
The [[Elven High Magic]] that destroyed Jhaamdath, also severely injured Auppenser by wiping out the vast majority of his worshipers, and his faith simply fell into obscurity over the next few hundred years. Only a few devotees of Auppenser remained as of 1374 DR.
