        "mainbody": "'''Cronus''', was a [[greater titan]] and [[deity]] of sinister ambition who was the progenitor of the first generation of [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian gods]]. His progeny went on to usurp him, banishing Cronus and his siblings to the depths of [[Carceri]], the [[plane]] of imprisonment.\n\nThe exact extent of Cronus's deific power following his imprisonment was uncertain.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|16}} Some claimed that he was a [[greater deity|greater power]], others believed he and the other Greater Titans were all [[intermediate deities]],<ref>\nand others considered him to be some sort of near-deity,Notably, ''[[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|Deities & Demigods]]'' does not list a power level for Kronos or any of the other Greater Titans. similar to the [[Lady of Pain]].",
        "Description": "Cronus had a handsome visage, with dark gleaming eyes, and stood over a {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} tall.",
        "Personality": "Anger simmered beneath the surface for Cronus over his eons of imprisonment, liable to boil up at any moment and cause him to unexpectedly lash out at people. He was also quite paranoid.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|26}}",
        "Abilities": "Cronus possessed a great deal of powers, especially over all that occurred within his [[divine realm]], being able to innateily will nearly anything into effect and these divine effects couldn't be stopped by mortal [[magic]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17}} These included being able to ''[[shape change]]'' at will,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17}} It was nearly impossible for mortals to harm him unless he willed it.\n\nSome claimed Cronus was omnipotent,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|10}} though in actuality he was actualy only near-omnipotent. And he was incapable of sending omens or portents due to his imprisoned state.",
        "Possessions": "He wielded a [[sickle]] made of [[adamant]], carrying a ''+5'' [[enchantment]] and the ability to cut through nearly any material it touched.",
        "Activities": "Cronus ruled as a tyrant over his fellow Greater Titans and kept a close eye on them all, for he was constantly paranoid of them plotting against him.\n\nWhen not bothering his fellow Titans, Cronus sat alone brooding upon his throne, plotting ways for him and his siblings to escape their imprisonment. To that end he frequently sent out messengers to scour for secret ways of escaping the prison plane. \n\nCronus humored the occasional visit from [[baatezu]] and [[tanar'ri]] seeking to petition the Titans to lend their might against the other side in their eternal [[Blood War]], hoping that they might one day offer him some sort of secret means of escaping Carceri. He would not grant aid for anything less than his freedom, for he had no desire to raise the combined ire of [[Hades (deity)|Hades]], [[Anthraxus]], and the other [[yugoloth]]s.",
        "History": {
            "History with Toril": "In the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] defended the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] in the [[Astral Plane]] from a tanar'ri incursion. The [[wizard]] [[Simon Regulus]] then appeared before them and asked them to provide aid to the githyanki known as [[Aâ€™rinthorm]], who was studying a captured [[githyanki]] device known as the ''[[Great Machine]]''. The machine had opened a mysterious portal and was flashing with a glyph of a black-and-white [[chain]]. He implored them to enter the portal and bring back to him the meaning behind the symbol.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9}}\n\nWhen the adventurers stepped through the portal they found themselves transported to the plane of Carceri and met the fallen [[paladin]] [[Elendil]]. At his urging they sought out Mount Othrys and its ruler Cronus for a way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|11}} \n\nWhen the group eventually arrived to Mount Othrys and got their audience with Cronus they found him deep in the midst of some kind of [[Cosmic Game]] with the [[marilith]] [[Cucathne]], the latter of whom was entertaining the titan with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17,32}} Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.\n\nAs part of this \"game of the gods\" the adventurers each had their bodies and minds temporarily merged with a powerful fiend somewhere in the [[multiverse]], then were placed in a combat arena.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|32}} There they did battle with bronze golems and a weak child of the [[hecatoncheire]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17-18}} unintentionally slighting Cronus as they were creatures of his own realm.\n\nFollowing the Cosmic Game, a jovial Cronus told Elendil that his friend Uri had died at the hands of the visiting tanar'ri and then gifted the adventurers the items that he had won from Cucathne, knowing they would one day use the items in battle against the fiends and took pleasure in that knowledge. Then, having learned of what they were seeking from his mind probing, Cronus explained to them that the black-and-white chain was a physical representation of the power of Carceri. Finally, he revealed Ellendil's deceptions and why he was thus trapped on the plane before opening a portal for the adventurers, yelling at them to leave before he could change his mind.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|18}}"

        "Realm": "The divine realm of Cronus was [[Mount Othrys]], the primary home of the Greater Titans following their imprisonment in Carceri. There within a crumbling palace of [[marble]], brought with them down into Othrys and looking like a twisted echo of the edifices found on [[Olympus]], Cronus resided at the center in a throne room measuring a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} wide. All who visited Mount Othrys were encouraged to meet with him, for with his near-omnipotence he knew of all visitors and so in retaliation would declare for some nasty form of doom to befall them. Once in the throne room, Cronus would examine the thoughts of his visitors so as to ensure that they hadn't been sent by the Olympians or his fellow Titans on some evil plot to discredit him.",
        "Relationships": "The [[Norse pantheon|Norse]] trickster god [[Loki]] was counted by Cronus as one of his allies. And among his notable progeny was the [[centaur]]-like being [[Chiron]].",
        "Worship": "Cronus wasn't actively worshiped by mortals following his imprisonment in Carceri, for the Olympians discouraged mortals from showing the Greater Titans any reverence."
