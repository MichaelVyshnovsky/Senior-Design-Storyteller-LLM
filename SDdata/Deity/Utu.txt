Utu was the Untheric god of the sun. His manifestation on Toril was killed during the Orcgate Wars. His symbol was a sun disc.
Utu manifested as a human male bathed in dazzling golden light that destroyed undead. Any non-indestructible object that touched his body would melt. Contact with any heat above 100 degrees Fahrenheit would instantly heal all of his wounds. He had the power to transform living matter into soil. In battle, he flung bits of the sun at his opponents, up to two miles away.
Utu presumably came to Toril with the other Untheric deities aboard the Galley of the Gods. He was killed by one of the orcish gods in , and his body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in Unther.
