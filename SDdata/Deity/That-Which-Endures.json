        "mainbody": "'''That-Which-Endures''' was a mysterious, faceless, and nameless entity whose power ranged between that of a [[primordial]] and that of an [[overgod]]. It represented the power of entropy, the inexorable change from order into [[chaos]].",
        "Personality": "The entity was amoral and uncaring. Some sages who studied That-Which-Endures claimed that it was [[evil]] and destructive, while others maintained that it merely represented part of a cycle of death and rebirth. That-Which-Endures itself, in fact, did not care about what others thought of it.",
        "Activities": "It was believed that That-Which-Endures was responsible for the entire concept of entropy and destruction, not only as an agent of chaos, but also presiding over the process by which matter decayed into its component parts, as a precursor to the rebuilding of all things.",
        "History": "Sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], That-Which-Endures cast its shadow on a clan of [[goblin]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s in the [[Underdark]]. The raw chaos power transformed the entire clan into a new race known as the [[verdan]].\n\nA shrine dedicated to That-Which-Endures existed within a system of tunnels located beneath [[Waterdeep]]. In [[1496 DR]],{{AI-time}} the shrine, which was rumored to be capable of destroying even powerful [[magic item]]s, was responsible for an earthquake that spread through the city when the [[dwarf]] [[Caerhan Coalsmith]] activated the shrine in an attempt to destroy the ''[[Orrery of the Wanderer]]''."
