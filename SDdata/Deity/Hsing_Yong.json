        "mainbody": "'''Hsing Yong''' ({{Pronounce|hiss|ing|_|yoong|refs=}}) was one of the [[Nine Immortals]] the served the [[Celestial Emperor]] in the [[Celestial Empire]], the dominant religion of [[Kara-Tur]], particularly [[Shou Lung]]. He was a god of fortune and prosperity.",
        "Description": "As one of the Nine Immortals, Hsing Yong had two aspects: one as a vast [[dragon]], the other a man who was a barefoot peasant in tattered robes typical of a scholar. A jug of [[wine]] was always being carried in his hand and his disposition was never known to be anything but cheerful.",
        "History": "According to the legendary history of Kara-Tur, shortly after the beginning of the world and [[human]]kind, the Celestial Emperor sent his great emissaries among the people, with each to teach one aspect of the True Path of Enlightenment. Hsing Yong was one of these emissaries.\nIn the legend, nine tired travelers stopped at a poor remote inn in the dead of winter, and the innkeeper lamented he had no more food to spare. So, despite their tiredness, four went to hunt for game, four went to forage, and the last cooked a meal for the travelers, the innkeeper, and his family. Afterward, they preserved the remainder of the food to see the folk through the rest of winter. Overjoyed, the innkeeper made a gift, and a revelation—he was no mortal but the last of the old gods of the land, and he gave the land to the nine to rule. Afterward, these Nine Travelers became the Nine Great Sovereigns, and they ruled Shou Lung for thirty cycles of years. They became the first emperors of Shou Lung, and were recorded in legend as the \"Nine Immortals\".\n\nFinally, the Nine Great Sovereigns, dressed as ordinary travelers, returned to the site of the inn, but found only a simple peasant's hut. The peasant, [[Nung Fu]], welcomed them in and fed them freely, though it was the depths of winter and he had little to spare. Afterward, these Nine Travelers offered a gift in exchange for this hospitality, and presented Nung Fu with the [[Emblems of Authority]]. They took him to their courts, investing him as emperor of Shou Lung. This marked the start of the Third Age of Shou Lung, the beginning of the calendar in [[-1250 DR|Shou Year 0 (−1250 DR)]].\n\nThe Nine Great Sovereigns were then the Nine Travelers once more. The tales disagree as to what became of them after that. According to some, they simply faded away. To others, they went with the gods into the heavens. More tell that the Nine Travelers still wander Shou Lung to ensure that rulers respect the memory of Nung Fu, and that innkeepers take good care of their guests.",
        "Worshipers": "Hsing Yong was a patron of both gamblers and travelers, who he delighted in causing fair or foul luck for during unfortunate moments. Many merchants also considered him to be their patron, though they mistrusted him due to his prosperity typically being very fickle.\n\nHis greatest followers would congregate in a major temple in the port city of [[Karatin]], that had been built by an ancient pirate to gain Hsing Yong's favor for his risky ventures. Ever since its completion, gambling and other games of chance were carried out within the temple."
