Gaerdal Ironhand (), was a lawful good deity of the Lords of the Golden Hills and the patron of warriors and protectors of gnomish communities. As such, he was honored in some manner by nearly all good-aligned gnomes, and one or two crusaders of his could be found in most sizable settlements. His symbol was an iron band, usually worn on the upper left arm, and his preferred weapon was the warhammer Hammersong. 
Gaerdal was the sternest and most serious of gnome deities.
Gaerdal resided in the Golden Hills, inside Dothion, which was found in Bytopia (also known as the Twin Paradises).
Gaerdal Ironhand had good relations with most of the other gnomish gods with the exception of Urdlen.  He disliked Baervan Wildwanderer because of his tendency to pull pranks. He was hostile toward the kobold and goblin pantheons.

Gaerdals church was organized as a strict military hierarchy. Although temples of Gaerdal Ironhand were rare, clerics built statues of Gaerdal at the entrance of gnomish settlements.
Priests of Gaerdal prayed at dawn. They called tendays "Tenhammers", after a custom of striking a metal shield with a large hammer at the end of each day and because ten days was a typical duration of guard duty for followers of Gaerdal. After ten Tenhammers, the final day was considered a holy day known as a Great Clang and believers would assemble to sing hymns and chants.
