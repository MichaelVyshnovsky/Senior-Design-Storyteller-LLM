The Balance domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters such as clerics with spells and powers related to the concept of balance. They could, once a day, use their wisdom to aid their defense.
Novice spellcasters could cast make whole, calm emotions, and clarity of mind. Those of some experience were able to use the dismissal, mass sanctuary, and banishment. Only the most versed clerics of this domain had access to word of balance, protection from spells, and weighed in the balance.
