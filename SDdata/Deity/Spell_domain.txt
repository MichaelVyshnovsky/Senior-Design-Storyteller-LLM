The Spell domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to the arcane and other spells.
Clerics with this domain had improved concentration and greater mastery over spellcasting.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the mage armor, silence, and anyspell spells. Clerics of some experience could cast Rarys mnemonic enhancer, break enchantment, and greater anyspell. Those that were masters this domain had access to limited wish, antimagic field, and Mordenkainens disjunction.
