'''Aseroth''', called the '''Winter Warlock''', was a [[demon lord]] associated with ice and cold.

<!--==Description==
==Personality==
==Abilities==
==Possessions==-->
==Realm==
Aseroth ruled the 566{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], a vast realm of glacial ice and snow called [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 566: Soulfreeze|Soulfreeze]]. So bitterly cold and malevolent was Soulfreeze, that a creature's thoughts and emotions could be frozen and drawn out of their heart and mind to drift on the wind as ice crystals. Aseroth ruled his realm from a deep fissure in the ice sheet called the Crystal Caverns. [[Demon]]s, [[remorhaz]]es, and [[ice archon]]s all lived and served there.

He also had an iron fortress where he left his body while astrally traveling. The fortress contained no treasures and was guarded by 10 [[marilith]]s who simply warned possible intruders to go away. If the fortress was attacked, however, Aseroth would return to his physical form immediately.<ref>

There was a portal between Soulfreeze and the [[Frostfell (plane)|Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]].<ref>
<!--==Activities==
==Relationships==-->
==History==
Aseroth was said to have once been an elemental prince of evil who became a demon lord.
