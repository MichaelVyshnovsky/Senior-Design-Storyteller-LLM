Callarduran Smoothhands (), also known as the Deep Brother, was a neutral gnome deity. He was primarily venerated as the patron of the Underdark-dwelling gnome subrace, the svirfneblin.

The church of Callarduran was highly organized, so that clans could share information and coordinate against the dangers of the Underdark, such as the drow.
Callarduran was a distant ally of the other non-evil deities of the gnome pantheon. He was also loosely linked to the other patrons of non-evil Underdark deities, such as Eilistraee, Shevarash, Dumathoin, and Geb. His foes were the Dark Seldarine and the other evil Underdark deities.
