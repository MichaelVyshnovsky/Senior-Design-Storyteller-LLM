        "mainbody": "'''Melira Taralen''' was a minor [[elf|elven]] [[deity|goddess]] of [[bards]], the fine arts, and [[song magic]]. Like many of her mortal contemporaries, she too had a benefactor, the leader of the [[elven pantheon]] [[Corellon]].",
        "Description": "Melira appeared as a pretty, {{SI|5.5|ft|long=yes}} tall elven female with flaxen hair and brilliant blue eyes garbed in an equally bright blue robe.",
        "Personality": "Melira was a vivacious goddess",
        "Powers": "Aside from being a skilled artist an performer and in addition to her normal spellcasting abilities, Melira could cast ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter|uncontrollable hideous laughter]]'', ''[[rainbow pattern]]'', ''[[lamentable belabourment]]'', ''[[permanent illusion]]'', and ''[[Otto's irresistible dance|irresistable dance]]'', each once every minute. Every three minutes she could cast ''[[animate objects]]'' with the power of the greatest [[cleric]]s. She was immune to [[illusion]]s, [[psionics]], movement-restricting spells, and all sound-based powers.",
        "Possessions": "At all times, Melira carried a special [[lute]] with an uncountable number of powers possessed by various other magical bardic instruments and a ''+3'' [[longsword]] which was twice as potent against evil beings (like [[harpies]] or wicked bards) that used illusion or sound to deceive or harm other beings.",
        "Realm": "[[File:MeliraSymbol.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The holy symbol of Melira.]]\nThe closest thing Melira had to her own [[divine realm]] was the [[Evergold]], the sacred [[Arborea]]n fountain of youth closely tied to (among other goddesses) her mother.",
        "Activities": "Melira was most often at the Evergold, singing and playing as her mother relaxed.",
        "Relationships": "Melira's mother was [[Hanali Celanil]], the elven goddess of beauty and love. Melira was technically a servant of her mother rather than Corellon himself, but given that he was Hanali's superior she did so by extension, even leaving aside his status as her artistic patron.\n\nMelira had no true foes of her own, though as a member of the Seldarine she opposed the [[Dark Seldarine|drow]] and [[Goblinoid pantheon|goblinoid]] deities. If she could be said to have any personal rivalry, it would be her friendly rivalry with the god [[Milil]], as their similar portfolios made her feel he might be \"poaching\" her worship. Even so, she counted him and his superior [[Oghma]] as an ally, and the two deities of song sometimes duetted.\n\nUnbeknownst to anyone except Corellon and Milil, and suspected only by [[Labelas Enoreth]], Hanali Celanil, [[Erevan Ilesere]], and [[Sehanine Moonbow]], Melira was in fact the daughter of Milil. The Lord of Song had also spent some time in a female form called Taralenarra, who acted as a mysterious mother figure during Melira's childhood.<ref>{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-10-09/Melira Taralen}}",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:Elfpriests.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A priestess of Melira (second to the right).]]\nMelira had worshipers of all alignments, though her worshiper base tended towards non-[[evil]] elves and her clergy specifically away from [[lawful]] tendencies. Her faithful were usually musically-inclined or appreciative of music, as she not only favored the musicians themselves but also their patrons, allegedly gifting boons upon those who treated their artists well. Notably, her clergy was absent of regular [[cleric]]s, as she only sought those with proven musical talent to comprise it. About 70% of the clergy were [[specialty priest]]s called [[Brystar]]s, the rest a motley of [[half-elf]] bards, elf [[minstrel]]s, [[mystic]]s, and other sorts.\n\nThere were few temples solely dedicated to Melira; her places of worship were often groves (especially where festivals were being held) and she otherwise had shrines within guildhalls or temples of Hanali. Rather than happening on set dates, holy days were simply declared just before a festival, with the vestaments of bright blue robes being worn at such times. On such days they celebrated by singing, dancing, and reciting poetry. The clergy had few duties or goals save for perfecting their individual musical skill and helping to train and hone others in their singing, strumming, and songwriting.",
        "History": "It was rumored that Hanali Celanil sent Melira to Corellon so she might be his apprentice, and that she proved so skilled that the Coronal of [[Arvandor]] \"set a place in the stars for her\"."
