        "mainbody": "Trishina, , was the goddess of the dolphins and consort of Deep Sashelas. She was the reason why aquatic elves had such a bond with dolphins. She was part of the asathalfinare pantheon, an alliance of good-aligned gods of aquatic races.\nTrishina could appear as either a female dolphin or young, attractive, femaleÂ sea elf and instantly switch forms at will. Humanoid depictions of the goddess bore similarities to the sleek-skinned shalarin.\nTrishina was a benevolent, peaceful goddess, optimistic that, with love and kindness, much of evil could find redemption. She was inclined to help anyone in trouble, whether from the waters or the land,\nHer clergy were pacifists but devoted themselves utterly to protecting the young of any race they encountered and saving as many lives as they could.\nShe was seen by many as the mother goddess of the shalarin. Since the shalarin were a transplanted culture, they adopted her as their main deity, naming her as Ridaatrisha."
