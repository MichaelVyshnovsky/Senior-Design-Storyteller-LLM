Ghaunadaur was old even before [[Ao]]'s time. The god of slime comes and goes as he will. I neither command nor compel him.''|[[Lolth]] to her daughter [[Eilistraee]]}}",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Although he was usually represented with an eye engraved in a purple disk, older manifestations could take shape in the form of a ''\"Y\"''. This symbol could appear as a demonstration of favor or could be found in ancient spaces devoted to the Lord of Slime."
        },
        "Personality": "Ghaunadaur was an unpredictable deity. False worshipers were sometimes rewarded by it, occasionally even with permanent magical boons, but they might just as well have been devoured by the Elder Eye without a second thought. Ghaunadaur enjoyed watching large horrible monsters as they hunted and devoured their prey, causing much suffering. When Ghaunadaur left the [[Inner Planes]] he was always silent, but some old records mention a gibbering and bestial language being spoken in the god's court. When communicating, Ghaunadaur used [[telepathy]] and kept its conversations blunt and simple.",
        "Relationships": "Ghaunadaur was thought to have no allies,\n\nConversely, Ghaunadaur's list of foes was extensive. He was an enemy of nearly every god associated with the [[Underdark]] as well as the entire [[Seldarine]] (for being a member of the [[Dark Seldarine]]), [[Malar]], and [[Gargauth]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Rituals": "Ghaunadaur's clergy prayed for their spells once per day at any time the local cult deemed important. The Elder Eye expected each prayer to be coupled with a sacrifice. It preferred living offerings, but when that was impossible it also accepted bones and food that were burned in oil while braziers of perfumed incense were burned as well. If the worshiper could not deliver any offerings to the deity, they were required to perform their prayer while holding one unprotected hand in an open flame.\n\nGhaunadans went on the Gathering, which consisted of incursions meant to kidnap and abduct sentient beings for the sacrificial altar of Ghaunadaur. These individuals were drugged and held under [[compulsion]] and pushed to walk up to the altar, where the leading cleric would pray and turn into slime. The slime then enveloped the victim and consumed them. This process could be repeated several times depending on the number of available subjects.\n\nThe prayers and rituals the Ghaunadans directed to the Lord of Slime were as ill-defined and amorphous as their god. Each cleric manifested prayers in the manner they saw fit and no cleric would suspect a worshiper of treachery or blasphemy for uttering nonsense or unintelligible gibberish."
        },
        "History": "According to [[Lolth]], \"Ghaunadaur was old even before [[Ao]]'s time.\" He was a very ancient deity, rumored to have emerged from the primordial ooze itself. In that age, it was worshiped by the largest of slimes and other crawling creatures, many of which contained an alien intelligence. In a rage over some unknown transgression, however, Ghaunadaur struck most of them mad and took their intellects. As an unforeseen result, many of these worshipers ceased to exist, which caused the Elder Eye's power to collapse.\n\nOnly in later aeons did some evil beings turn to Ghaunadaur, looking for an alternative to the established deities.\n\nGhaunadaur was worshiped by some of the dark elves of [[Ilythiir]] beginning in the age of [[First Flowering]] and continuing through the [[Crown Wars]]. Later, Ghaunadaur became a member of the drow pantheon because of worship by drow disaffected with Lolth.\n\nIn [[1379 DR]], Ghaunadaur, finally fed up with Lolth, left the [[Demonweb Pits]] and created a new realm in the [[Deep Caverns]]."
