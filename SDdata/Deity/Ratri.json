        "mainbody": "'''Ratri''' was a [[deity]] of darkness and night in the [[Vedic pantheon]],<ref group=\"note\" name=\"reason\">There were no known worshipers of Ratri in the Realms, particularly in [[Malatra]] where some other Vedic powers were worshiped. However, Ratri is detailed on this wiki because of her relations with the Faerûnian powers Mask and Shar, as detailed in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]''.",
        "Description": "The [[avatar]] of Ratri typically took the form of a beautiful, well-proportioned woman. It bore a swarthy complexion, along with hair and eyes of a black hue. Beyond her avatar, Ratri never sent omens to her followers, though she sometimes manifested through her [[favored animal]], the [[monkey]].\n\nThe goddess's true form was merely a silhouette, one of a voluptuous woman covered by innumerable stars that acted as her eyes.",
        "Personality": "Ratri was a fickle and chaotic individual, who would not hesitate to punish worshipers that offended her even slightly by spotlighting them in bright, revealing light until they either made amends or were caught by authorities. She did not consider herself to be a personification of darkness, but rather a shepherd over it, and was more than capable of appreciating light.",
        "Abilities": "Ratri's avatar possessed a number of unique innate abilities. She could inflict blindness upon anyone that crossed her shadow or inflict harm upon someone just with a look of anger from her eyes. She could create or dispel darkness within a {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} radius area at will. And she could perceive anything that occurred under the cover of night.\n\nIn regards to [[spell]]s, Ratri's avatar could cast from any [[school of magic]]. She particularly liked to cast ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]''.",
        "Possessions": "Ratri wore a magical [[cloak]] that could cause any person or object that touched it to be cast into the [[Ethereal Plane]]. She always carried a [[gold]]en sitar, that could [[charm]] any creature by being played. And she wielded a ''+2 [[sword]]'' that could inflict blindness upon those struck by it.",
        "Realm": "She lived on the [[plane]] of Grey Waste, and as a [[demigod]]dess had no [[divine realm]] of her own. Instead Ratri traveled throughout the three layers of the Grey Waste, stealing whatever she could from [[Greater Power]]s. Most often she made herself an unwelcomed guest in the halls of the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] power [[Hades (deity)|Hades]] and the [[Norse pantheon|Norse]] power [[Hel]].\n\nAfter becoming a [[lesser power]], Ratri settled a divine realm in the layer of [[Niflheim]],{{Cite dragon/113/Welcome to Hades|11-12}} known as '''the Dark of Night'''. With her being a [[chaotic neutral]] deity, the reason for her divine realm residing on this plane of [[neutral evil]] was a matter of debate among planar scholars. Uniquely, her realm was free of the life draining that affected much of the Gray Wastes, making it a sort of safe haven for those few travelers who managed to find it.\n\nThe exact location of the Dark of Night within the Gray Wastes was unknown, for as befitting her chaotic nature Ratri had it moved whenever she pleased. When this occurred her [[petitioner]]s would be left behind, but their [[spirit]]s would feel drawn towards its direction. And on occasion, this moving stole a bit of ground away from the divine realms of other deities in the Wastes.",
        "Relationships": "Among her fellow Vedic powers, Ushas was good friends with Savitri and [[Ushas]], deities of day and dawn respectively. However, she had some sort of rivalry with Surya, the Vedic god of light. Among the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] she maintained cordial relations with [[Mask]] and [[Shar]], though she was by no means allied with them. According to rumors she kept Mask at an arm's length, due to the interest he showed in her power.\n\nDuring her days as a wandering demigoddess, Ratri often used her abilities to dominate the various [[demodand]]s and [[yugoloth]]s she encountered in her travels. Whatever [[proxies]] she had were widely unknown, as their skills in stealth kept them anonymous.",
        "Worshipers": "Ratri was worshiped by a number of robbers, thieves, murderers, and other sorts of scoundrels. However, she was not primarily a patron of such behavior and did not value thieves over others. Those who prayed and performed the proper sacrifices might receive aid from her in having their activities concealed, but she was equally feared as much as she was venerated due to her fickle nature.\n\nBeing a goddess of the night, the [[priest]]s of Ratri conducted their activities during that time and slept during the day. They typically wielded [[dagger]]s, [[sling]]s, and [[sword]]s. They kept their heads bald and they wore dark grey [[robe]]s as part of their priestly vestments. Priests had access to spells from the [[All sphere|all]], [[Astral sphere|astral]], [[Divination sphere|divination]], [[Guardian sphere|guardian]], [[Healing sphere|healing]], [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]], [[Protection sphere|protection]], [[Summoning sphere|summoning]] [[sphere]]s. They particularly were gifted the spells ''darkness, 15' radius'' and ''[[light]]''. Additionally, they were gifted with the ability to [[infravision|see in total darkness]].\n\nIn the [[Domains of Dread]], Ratri was once worshiped in the domain of [[Sri Raji]].<ref>"
