        "mainbody": "'''Inanna''' was one of two [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric goddesses]] of love and war (the other was her \"daughter\", [[Ishtar]]). Her manifestation on [[Toril]] was killed during the [[Orcgate Wars]]. Her symbol was a shepherd's staff.",
        "Description": "Inanna manifested as a beautiful [[human]] female. She wielded a small double-bladed brass axe that caused any armor it hit to crumble into dust. Her breast plates negated any damage against heat, cold, fangs, or claws. She drove a [[chariot]] pulled by seven flying [[lion]]s in battle.",
        "Divine Realm": "Inanna's realm, known as the Jealous Heart, existed in [[Phlegethos]], the 4{{th}} layer of the [[Nine Hells]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. before the magic goddess moved it to the 3{{rd}} layer [[Minauros]]. Within her realm there were planar conduits to reach the worlds where she was venerated.\n\nThe Jealous Heart was a great field covered in crimson dust, crisscrossed by rivers of blood that nourished the sweet fruits of the trees, and tinted with reddish light that danced through the air. Though the physical land was not fiery, it might look that way and certainly felt that way.\n\nInanna's was the passion known in the caress of steel or flesh, and any who entered her realm succumbed to a desire for one or other other within a day, although by the end of the next the feelings would swing back to the other extreme. These feelings, while not cold, were rational, with everyone still having goals and plans on how to achieve them. The main city, Eridan, was a place where the lovers of the realm took defense against the warriors one day and tried to cut their way out of the city while the warriors fought their way in the next.",
        "Relationships": "Inanna was once the wife of [[Enlil]], but he set her aside, leaving her to seethe under his rule.\n\nThe goddess [[Ishtar]] was born from Inanna. Once they were the same being, but as Inanna's people grew more civilized, her pantheon split in two, with new aspects of the older gods becoming entities in their own right.",
        "History": "Inanna presumably came to [[Toril]] with the other Untheric deities aboard the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]''. She was killed by one of the [[orc pantheon|Orcish gods]] in {{Yearlink|-1071}}, and her body was laid to rest in a [[God-Tomb]] in [[Unther]]."
