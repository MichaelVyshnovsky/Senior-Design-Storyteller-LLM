'''Eagle''' was a deity and [[animal spirit]] worshiped by the [[Wild elf|green elves]] of [[Evermeet]].

==Description==
His role was to bestow good fortune but also to bring omens of impending catastrophes. The spirit appeared as a giant black [[eagle]], and sometimes as a giant warrior visible in the clouds. His gaze could be lightning and his voice thunder.

==Relationships==
Like the other nature spirits venerated by the Sy-tel-quessir, Eagle served the pantheon of the [[Seldarine]], and specifically [[Rillifane Rallathil]] to the degree that he was considered an [[aspect]] of the Leaflord.<ref>

==Priesthood==
Eagle's priests worked for the common good and tried to achieve good fortune for their community.

==Worshipers==
Next to the green elves of [[Toril]], this powerful spirit was also worshiped under the name of '''Thunder''' by the [[Wikipedia:Native American|Native American]] peoples of [[Earth]].
