        "mainbody": "Spheres''', also known as the '''Winds of the Gods''' or '''Winds''' in ancient [[Netheril]], referred to \"spheres of influence\" within the entirety of [[divine magic]]. Each deity had a set of spheres of influence in which they were interested and which they embodied. Priests of a deity had access to the spells in that deity's spheres. Some deities provided only limited access (called ''minor access'') to certain spheres and full access (called ''major access'') to others.",
        "Variations": "In the age of ancient Netheril, there were nine winds: [[Buffering]], [[Perpetual]], [[Predictable]], [[Prevailing]], [[Sporadic]], [[Terrestrial]], [[Transcendent]], [[Wandering]], and [[Zephyrous]].\n\nOriginally, there were sixteen spheres: [[All sphere|All]], [[Animal sphere|Animal]], [[Astral sphere|Astral]], [[Charm sphere|Charm]], [[Combat sphere|Combat]], [[Creation sphere|Creation]], [[Divination sphere|Divination]], [[Elemental sphere|Elemental]], [[Guardian sphere|Guardian]], [[Healing sphere|Healing]], [[Necromantic sphere|Necromantic]], [[Plant sphere|Plant]], [[Protection sphere|Protection]], [[Summoning sphere|Summoning]], [[Sun sphere|Sun]], and [[Weather sphere|Weather]]. \n\nThe Elemental sphere was subdivided into Elemental [[Elemental air sphere|Air]], [[Elemental earth sphere|Earth]], [[Elemental fire sphere|Fire]], and [[Elemental water sphere|Water]] spheres. The \"All\" sphere was available to every faith.\n\n[[Maztica]]n deities granted access to two unique spheres called [[hishna]] and [[pluma]], but in return never gave their followers the Necromantic and Summoning spheres.<ref><ref>\n<!-- {{Deity spheres}} TODO -->"
