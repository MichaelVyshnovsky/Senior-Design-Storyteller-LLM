        "mainbody": "Spheres, also known as the Winds of the Gods or Winds in ancient Netheril, referred to \"spheres of influence\" within the entirety of divine magic. Each deity had a set of spheres of influence in which they were interested and which they embodied. Priests of a deity had access to the spells in that deitys spheres. Some deities provided only limited access (called minor access) to certain spheres and full access (called major access) to others. \nIn the age of ancient Netheril, there were nine winds Buffering, Perpetual, Predictable, Prevailing, Sporadic, Terrestrial, Transcendent, Wandering, and Zephyrous.\nOriginally, there were sixteen spheres All, Animal, Astral, Charm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Elemental, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, Plant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and Weather. \nThe Elemental sphere was subdivided into Elemental Air, Earth, Fire, and Water spheres. The \"All\" sphere was available to every faith.\nMaztican deities granted access to two unique spheres called hishna and pluma, but in return never gave their followers the Necromantic and Summoning spheres."
