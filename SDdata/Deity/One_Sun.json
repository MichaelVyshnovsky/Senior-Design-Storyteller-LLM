        "mainbody": "he One Sun was a sun deity worshiped by the Calishites under several dynasties during the Second and Third Ages of Calimshan.\nThe One Sun was worshiped as the supreme head of all other gods and goddesses. The One Sun was worshiped in many guises, as a deity of light, health, war, knowledge, and the arts.\nWhile most modern scholars of Calishite history believed, correctly, that the One Sun was an alias for many gods and goddesses collectively worshiped at that time in history, a minority held the view that the One Sun was a unique entity.\nMany temples to the One Sun were constructed during the Vahlen Dynasty, and at least one temple to the One Sun was found in the city of Calimport.\nRecognition of the One Sun as a deity seems to have been present as early as the reign of Erehnir bakkal Nakkar IV, who had one of the famous Eight Erehnirs of Volothamp carved in the image of a sun deity. For the most part, however, it was the Vahlen Dynasty that added the worship of the sun and sky with that of the worship of genies begun by the Erehnirs.\n400 years after the fall of the Vahlens, worship of the One Sun was taken up again by the Cajaan Dynasty\nWhen the Alimir Hive conquered Calimshan in , the last Cajaan ruler, syl-pasha Violir IX famously called on the One Sun to blind the beholders and their minions with the power of light. Instead, Pasha Violir was petrified on the steps of the One Suns temple, and Calimport and the Cajaar dynasty fell."
