The Charm domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with charm-related spells and powers.
Once a day, they could become more charismatic for a minute.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the charm person, calm emotions, and suggestion spells. Clerics of some experience could cast emotion, charm monster, and geas/quest. Those that were masters of this domain had access to insanity, demand, and dominate monster.
