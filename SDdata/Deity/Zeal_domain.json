        "mainbody": "he Zeal domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters zeal-related spell powers. Once per day, they could perform a skill at the very best of their ability without having to take the extra time and care normally needed to do so.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the bless, consecrate, and helping hand spells. Clerics of some experience could cast dismissal, commune, and greater dispel magic. Those that were masters in this domain had access to holy word, holy aura, and miracle."
