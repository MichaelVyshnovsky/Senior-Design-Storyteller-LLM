        "mainbody": "omoku, the Wide Gazing, was a spirit who was guardian of western Wa. He was one of the Eight Million Gods.\nHe appeared as a powerful warrior clad in golden armor, wielding sword or spear and mounted upon a demonic steed.\nKomoku ordered that a long silver cord be stretched across the Sea of Blossoms, with one end tied to a tree on top of Mount Fo on Tsukishima and other end tied to a similar tree on top of Mount Chusa on Shidekima. This was to prevent the whole island of Shidekima from drifting away. Naturally enough, the trees were closely guarded.\nKomoku the Wide Gazing was venerated at the Shrine of the West Wind in Aru. The   statue of Komoku was made of wood and covered in a thin layer of beaten gold. Worshipers made offerings of flowers and origami."
