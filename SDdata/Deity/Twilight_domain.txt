The '''Twilight domain''' was a divine domain for [[cleric]]s of [[deities]] whose portfolio involved the transition from light to darkness, rest, and protection. [[Cleric]]s who chose this domain were granted free access to these spellsâ€”they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance.
