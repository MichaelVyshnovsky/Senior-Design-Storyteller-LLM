Relkath of the Infinite Branches was  deity in the Yuir elven pantheon. There are some elves who believe that Relkath was merely an aspect of Rillifane Rallathil. Relkath, aspect or discrete entity, was thought to cease to exist with the downfall of the Yuir elves.
Relkath was a chaotic and unpredictable god. Whilst he was known to defend the Yuir elves, he also took action against some of them, turning priests into trees and villages into forests.
According to the half-elf Rizcarn, who himself claimed to be Relkaths messenger, butternut trees were Relkaths favorite due to their spreading branches.
Forests were said to sprout wherever Relkath touched the ground.
The small city of Relkaths Foot in Aglarond was named after the ancient god. Legends said that the four trees at the heart of the city sprang from his foot, which lay buried below the city.
