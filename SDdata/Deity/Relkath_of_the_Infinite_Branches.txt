'''Relkath of the Infinite Branches''' was  deity in the [[Yuir]] elven pantheon. There are some elves who believe that Relkath was merely an aspect of [[Rillifane Rallathil]]. Relkath, aspect or discrete entity, was thought to cease to exist with the downfall of the Yuir elves.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|12}}

==Personality==
Relkath was a chaotic and unpredictable god. Whilst he was known to defend the Yuir elves, he also took action against some of them, turning priests into trees and villages into forests.

According to the [[half-elf]] [[Rizcarn]], who himself claimed to be Relkath's messenger, [[butternut]] trees were Relkath's favorite due to their spreading branches.<ref>

==Powers==
Forests were said to sprout wherever Relkath touched the ground.

==Rumors and Legends==
The small city of [[Relkath's Foot]] in [[Aglarond]] was named after the ancient god. Legends said that the four trees at the heart of the city sprang from his foot, which lay buried below the city.
