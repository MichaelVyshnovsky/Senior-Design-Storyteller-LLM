Sssthasiness, the Lord of Venom was one of the many deities that split off from the World Serpent.
Sssthasiness appeared to his followers as a writhing swarm of serpents coiled into a roughly humanoid shape, and spoke through the mouths of the countless snakes in the swarm. His symbol, similarly, was a swarm of snakes.
Sssthasiness was worshiped by some yuan-ti and dark nagas.
Sssthasiness was originally an aspect of the World Serpent that became a true deity when the World Serpent shattered however, he was later destroyed by an elf god before the Crown Wars, and Talona subsumed what remained of him as an aspect.
