When pleased, Isis might appear as a peaceful rain. When angry, she would take the form of a storm. Isis might appear in a flow of running water to make her wisdom known or visit and bless two lovers. Isis might appear as a tree that grew and disappeared in the length of a single day, signaling the start of the growing season. She might appear before a warrior facing great odds in her service, bestowing upon the man a single kiss."

        "Realm": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] Isis was said to have two [[divine realm]]s, one in [[Amoria]] known as [[Quietude]] and one in [[Heliopolis]] known as [[Gizekhtet]],\n\nTo those who believed in the Great Wheel cosmology, Isis was said to only come to Quietude during the spring season in Mulhorand, in order to overseer the course of that nation's rivers and its conditions for planting. Towards the end of summer, she would return to her spouse in Heliopolis.",
        "Relationships": "Isis was the daughter of [[Geb]] and [[Nut (deity)|Nut]]. She was the sister of [[Thoth]] and wife of Osiris, as well as the mother of Horus (later [[Horus-Re]]). Isis and Nephthys were twins.\n\nThe non-evil members of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] were allies of Isis, as was [[Sharess]]. The Bountiful Lady considered [[Chauntea]] a confidant and friend.\n\nDue to their similar portfolios and differing alignments, Isis often found herself in conflict with [[Sebek]].\n\nOutside of the Mulhorandi deities, she was on mildly good terms with [[Mystra]] and in opposition to the goddess [[Shar]], being opposed to all usage of the [[Shadow Weave]].",

            "Celebrations": "The clergy of the church of Isis celebrate a number of rituals on a daily basis.\n*[[Greengrass]]: Followers of Isis celebrated the completion of sowing the fields.\n*[[Highharvestide]]: Celebrants thanked Isis and Osiris for a successful harvest."

        "History": "[[File:Resurrection of Osiris.jpg|thumb|right|''The resurrection of Osiris.'']]\nIsis, with the assistance of [[Nephthys]], resurrected [[Osiris]] when he was murdered by [[Set]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]], Isis and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of [[demigod]]s and led the [[Mulhorand]]i uprising against the [[Imaskari]], in a manner similar to how the [[Chosen]] manifested in other regions. As of [[1489 DR]], Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people."
