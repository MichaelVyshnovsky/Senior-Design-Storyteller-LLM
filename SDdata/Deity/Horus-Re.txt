Horus-Re, () known as Helcaliant in Thay and Hokatep in Unther, was the leader of the Mulhorandi pantheon. Once the change-promoting deity simply known as Horus, the young god received the powers and personality of his slain father Re, becoming a more staunch traditionalist.

Horus was originally a young deity that often sided with Anhur in pressing change to his father, Re.
During the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari, it was Horus that slew Lord Artificer Yuvaraj in . When Re was defeated by Gruumsh during the Orcgate Wars, the failing deity passed his powers and domain to Horus before passing on. Upon gaining this power Horus became Horus-Re, and began exhibiting the personality traits and beliefs of his dead father.
During the Second Sundering, Horus returned as a separate entity from Re along with other deities from the pantheon in the form of demigods and led the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari, in a manner similar to how the Chosen manifested in other regions. As of 1489 DR, Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people.
