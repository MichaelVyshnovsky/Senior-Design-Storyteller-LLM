She dwelled on the island of Evermeet.\nYathaghera appeared as a magnificent pegasus with a silver mane and rainbow-colored wings.\nYathaghera was the daughter of the winged unicorn god Eachthighern, and the younger sister of Lurue.\nAnother story claimed that Yathaghera was simply the name and appearance under which Lurue was worshiped among the elves.\nYathaghera was queen of the pegasi and unicorns of Evermeet, but her subjects actually worshiped her father, Eachthighern, rather than her. The chaotic unicorns rarely even paid attention to her."
