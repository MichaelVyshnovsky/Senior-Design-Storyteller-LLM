The Joy domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with joyous-themed spells and powers.
Priests with this domain had a blessed skill at diplomacy.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the vision of heaven, elation, and distilled joy spells. Clerics of some experience could cast good hope, Lliiras laugh, and greater heroism. Those that were masters of this domain had access to starmantle, sympathy, and Ottos irresistible dance.
