        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Milil often appeared on Toril as haunting music or as a beautiful disembodied male voice that resonated within woodland clearings. He enjoyed planting beneficial visions in the minds of performers and artists that pleased him, which included locations of treasure or the whereabouts of long-lost loved ones. Another favored manifestation of Milil was that of a shimmering radiance, emanating from a bard, poet or other performer who was in the throes of inspiration in the pinnacle of a performance. The sight of this brilliant aura could move audiences to tears, bring them to give generous donations and offerings or act in blindfold obedience of the performing artist.\n\nTo signify his approval of artistic work, whether it be a song, epic poem, theatrical performance or the like, Milil would conjure a golden-lined image of two dancing [[hollyphant]]s. This appeared out of thin air or, if on parchment, as what seemed like glowing yellow [[ink]]."
        },
        "Personality": "Milil was a consummate performer and possessed a confident, constantly inspired personality. He possessed an impeccable memory as well as a broad knowledge of lore from across [[Toril]] that served to bolster the facile improvisations of which he was more-than-capable. However, Milil was also quite egotistical and adored being the center of attention, and was easily bored when this wasn't the case. He was also extremely flirtatious, with both mortals and other deities alike.",
        "Powers": "Along with his vast knowledge of many magical [[spell]]s, particular those from the [[charm]] [[school of magic]], Milil's singing voice could destroy any magical ''[[Silence|silencing]]'' effects and pacify any beings within his vicinity. He could masterfully play any instrument and had perfect memory of any song heard by him or any priest in his service. Milil was immune to any spells or effects of a vocal or musical manifestation and, by touch, could cause or confer ''[[deafness]]'' or the specific knowledge of a song, including exact tune and lyrics so that it may never be forgotten by the recipient.",
        "Possessions": "Milil's favored weapon was ''[[Sharptongue]]'', a magical [[rapier]] he would, on occasion, lend to mortals performing great quests in his honor. He could also conjure a [[harp]] of magical flames, which was a favored display to demonstrate his divinity.",
        "Relationships": "As a deity, Milil, along with [[Deneir]] and [[Gond]], served the greater power of [[Oghma]]. Despite this shared service, Milil had little in common with Gond, and they had a slightly strained relationship.\n\nMilil maintained very good relations with a number of powerful gods, including [[Mystra]], [[Sune]], and [[Lliira]], as well as with the gods of the [[Seldarine|elven pantheon]]. He felt that [[Finder Wyvernspur]] showed some promise, but Finder did not feel the same about Milil.\n\nAfter Milil made a mocking ballad about Cyric and his insanity, the Prince of Lies became an enemy of the Lord of Song.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Orders": "*[[Harmonious Order]]: This group of personable and swaggering paladins encouraged bards to accompany them to create ballads based on their exploits taken in Milil's name."
        },
        "History": "{{sectstub}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Ayryn Farlight]] held a ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' session for select members of the [[Society of Sensation]], using her sorcerous gift to observe various deities of [[Toril]]. When she attempted to ''scry'' [[Tymora]], her magic sight was redirected by the goddess to observing [[Jasmine]] and [[Joel]] of Finder Wyvernspur's Band. Eventually, her sight was focused on Milil who was delighted to have an audience. The deity used magic to affix the scrying and performed the following songs: ''[[The Baker's Daughter]]''; a jaunty [[hin]] tune known as ''[[Pipeweed Dreams]]''; a lengthy ballad called ''[[the Seven Sisters (ballad)|The Seven Sisters]]''; ''[[Three Thayvian Roses]]''; ''[[the Purple Dragons of Cormyr (ballad)|The Purple Dragons of Cormyr]]''; and a number of Faerûnian folk songs about such mundane things as milking [[cow]]s, weather, and crops. Eventually, the Sensates started getting bored of the performance and Milil responded by starting to sing an [[opera]]—''[[the Fall of Myth Drannor (opera)|The Fall of Myth Drannor]]''. The long and torturous performance was a punishment for trying to spy on a god.\n\nDuring the [[Era of Upheaval]], Milil was simply an [[exarch]] of [[Oghma]].\n\nSoon after making a mocking ballad about [[Cyric]], Milil was ejected from the pantheon and banished to the [[Fugue Plane]]. As a result, musical prayers went out of fashion among bards. Some time before the late {{YearlinkName|1400}}, Lord of Song was rescued by a mysterious being called [[Withers]], who pulled him out of the Fugue Plane. However, as payment, Milil had to \"honor the worthy\", whenever Withers asked him to, a favour he was eternally invoking."
