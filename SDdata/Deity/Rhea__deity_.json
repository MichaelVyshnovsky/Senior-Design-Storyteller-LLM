        "mainbody": "Rhea was a greater power of fertility and life, one of the Greater Titans, and mother of the first Olympians.There were no known worshipers of Rhea in the Realms. However, Rhea is mentioned in the opening pages of the Living City module No Time to Lose. For this reason, Rhea is documented in this article.\nThe avatars of Rhea typically took the form of young, incredibly beautiful women with voluptuous figures that were immodestly dressed.\nAvatars of Rhea were unable to be harmed by weapons made of unforged natural materials, such as stone or wood, and animals were unwilling to bring harm to them.\nRhea ocassionally answered mortal appeals concerning fertility or motherhood, but generally did not interfer as she had given her responibilities over to the other Olympians. She acted as a great advisor to the pantheon, for whom members sought out whenever they couldnt turn to each other for advice.\nRhea lacked a divine realm of her own, but lived with the Olympians in the shared divine realm of Olympus and resided in her own grand palace.\nRhea was born as one of the many Greater Titans of the primeval deities Gaea and Uranus. However, Cronus had went back on a promise he had made to their mother Gaea to free their monstrous siblings, the hecatoncheires, from their imprisonment by Uranus. Furious, Gaea laid a curse upon Cronus, proclaiming that one day his own children would usurp him, as they were born. These first five children were Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia, and Poseidon. With each child sacrificed Rhea grew more and more anguished.\nBy their sixth child, one who would later be known as Zeus, Rhea had grown furious and would not allow Cronus to takeaway another of her children. She tricked Cronus into instead swallowing a stone in swaddling clothes. This gave their mother Gaea the chance to smuggle the child away and leave him in the care of nymphs on a remote island. When he reached adulthood, Zeus returned disguised as one of Cronuss cupbearers and gave him a potion that induced him into vomiting up his five other children.\nZeus and his siblings, the newly formed Olympian pantheon, then usurped Cronus. She yielded much of her power and responsibilities to her children, who in turn gifted her a palace in Olympus that far exceeded the one she once shared with Cronus.\nShe had no religion of her own, nor proxies, though Rhea drew veneration from the entirety of the Olympian pantheon and thus inadvertently received veneration from mortals all across the Prime Material."
