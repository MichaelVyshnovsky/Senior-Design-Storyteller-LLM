        "mainbody": "'''Ushas''' was an interloper [[deity]] of light and dawn in the [[Vedic pantheon]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"reason\">There were no known worshipers of Ushas in the Realms, particularly in [[Malatra]] where some other Vedic powers were worshiped. However, Ushas is detailed on this wiki because of her relations with the Faerûnian power Lathander, as detailed in ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' and ''[[Planes of Conflict (boxed set)|Planes of Conflict]]''.",
        "Avatar": "The [[avatar]] of Ushas generally took the form of a beautiful woman, garbed in red and gold robes.",
        "Personality": "Ushas had a benevolent and beneficent demeanor to her, desiring to protect [[human]]s from [[evil]] [[spirit]]s, especially those associated with the night. She devoted herself to fighting against the forces of darkness.",
        "Abilities": "The avatar of Ushas was said to be so beautiful that it could ''[[charm]]'' others. She could ''[[reincarnate]]'' other living creatures, [[Awakening (divine)|instantly awaken]] all nearby [[good]] creatures, and dispel [[spell]]s of both charm and [[enchantment]]. Her avatar was also capable of casting [[divine magic|divine spells]] from the [[sphere]]s of [[All sphere|All]], [[Charm sphere|Charm]], [[Healing sphere|Healing]], [[Protection sphere|Protection]], and [[Sun sphere|Sun]].",
        "Possessions": "Ushas carried an [[enchanted]] staff that could fire a ray of golden light out to a distance of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. She rode on a one-wheeled [[chariot]] that was made from a piece of a sun and pulled by seven red, incorporeal [[horse]]s that could not be affected by [[magic]]. Whenever it was in a battle with [[fiend]]s, the chariot would shed an intense damaging light that would only hurt such creatures.",
        "Realm": "Ushas resided on the [[Eronia]] layer of the [[plane]] of [[Elysium]], where she shared the [[divine realm]] of [[Morninglory]] with the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] god of light, [[Lathander]].",
        "Activities": "Ushas was said to spend her nights driving away evil spirits in preparation for the dawn. She was also one of many deities that purportedly oversaw the passage of the sun across the sky. In later years, she was said to be working closely alongside Lathander in these duties.\n\nWhen not doing her godly duties, Ushas often visited the divine realm of [[Goldfire]] on [[Mount Celestia]].<ref>",
        "Relationships": "Among her fellow Vedic powers, Ushas was good friends with [[Ratri]], Savitri, and Surya.",
        "Worshipers": "In order to be a [[priest]] of Ushas, it was required that one be female. Her priestesses were expected to greet each day with songs and music. They were also expected to never retreat from evil and had the unique power to [[petrify]] evil beings within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of them.\n\nShe was notably worshiped by some [[quesar]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Quesar}}",
        "Notable Worshipers": "* The leading [[proxy]] of Ushas and the [[cleric]] in charge of her temple in Morninglory was a woman by the name of [[Allain Crimson]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Among those who saw fit to portray the powers as having human-like emotions, it was often insisted that Ushas and Lathander were falling in love with each other. Additionally, some claimed the two powers had discovered a way to open [[portal|gates]] to the realms of deities of darkness and were shedding light into them."
