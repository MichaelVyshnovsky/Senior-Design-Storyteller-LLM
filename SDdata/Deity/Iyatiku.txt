Iyatiku, who was also called the Corn Mother, was a great spirit of the folklore and myth of the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin of northern Maztica.
The Corn Mother was called into being by the song of Sussistinako, the Spider Woman. As a spirit of creation, Iyatiku helped make all of the flowers, animals, and other life forms prevalent within the Pasocada Basin.
