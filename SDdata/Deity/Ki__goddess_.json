        "mainbody": "Ki was the Untheric goddess of nature. Her manifestation on Toril was killed during the Orcgate Wars. Her symbol was the iris.\nKi manifested as a beautiful, petite woman with delicate features. She could not be touched by anything thrown through the air at her, and at will she could change her shape into any non-monstrous form. She could summon up to one hundred of any creature of the beast type, though only one species at a time and no species could be summoned more than once per week. She took half damage from any attack.\nKi helped maintain relationships between the other Untheric powers and between such gods of earth as Silvanus and Mielikki.\nKis priests were druids.\nKi came to Toril with the other Untheric deities aboard the Galley of the Gods. She was killed by one of the orcish gods in , and her body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in Unther."
