The Strength domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters strength-enhancing spell powers.
They gained the ability to call upon their deity for supernatural strength once a day.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the enlarge person, bulls strength, and magic vestment spells. Clerics of some experience could cast spell immunity, righteous might, and stoneskin. Those that were masters this domain had access to Bigbys grasping hand, Bigbys clenched fist, and Bigbys crushing hand.
