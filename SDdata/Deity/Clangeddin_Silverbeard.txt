Clangeddin Silverbeard, (|audio=Clangeddin.ogg ) was the primary dwarven god of war, a deity of battle and honour in warfare. The Lord of the Twin Axes, as attested by his holy symbol, embodied the warrior spirit that made dwarven armies so formidable, and the Father of Battles lived, breathed, and in some ways died for warfare.
Clangeddin appeared as a burly,  or  tall dwarf in rusty chainmail. He was bald but had a titularly silver beard, constantly darting eyes and an ever-present smile.
Clangeddin was a dauntless and resolute god with a strict sense of ethics. He never backed down from a challenge, refusing to surrender even when all was lost, and was known for often clutching victory from seemingly impossible situations.
Despite these severe aspects of his personality, Clangeddin was also impetuous and merry in battle, often singing both stirring ballads of battle and taunting, unnerving ditties in the middle of his fights. He shouted his appreciation of bravery and feats of skill, even when directed against himself, and most admired those who helped themselves.
Despite his hatred of deceit, Clangeddin was a cunning strategist who extended his roaring approval to shrewd strategies. He was a master of turning the tables against enemy armies by anticipating their movements on the battlefield and then hiding hints, cues, and warnings in the lyrics of his songs, which dwarves had learned to listen to. Furthermore, it was possible to talk him out of pursuing a given feud and even to win him over, so long as one could speak faster than he swung his axe.
Clangeddins clerics, known as alaghor ("Those who demonstrate valor in battle") taught and learnt the art of forging armour and weapons, and practiced military training each day. Though they sought to make their dwarven brethren stronger on the battlefield through their teachings, followers of Clangeddin were often viewed as little more than bloodthirsty barbarians among other races.
Clangeddins priests wore silver war helms and chain mail. He was worshiped before and during battle and weapons were sacrificed to him in honor.
Clangeddin and his followers hated giants and trained their fellow dwarves in special ways to fight them.
