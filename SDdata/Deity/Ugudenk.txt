'''Ugudenk''', called '''the Squirming King''', was an [[obyrith]] [[demon lord]] that burrowed through the Abyss.

==Description==
Ugudenk had the form of an impossibly large worm-like creature; in fact, no one could claim to have seen the end of its body. Its jaw was a complex structure of multiple jaws and hooked tentacles made of muscle, the whole of which opened like some horrifying carnivorous flower when it hungered.

==Abilities==
Ugudenk's primary defense was its sheer size: even abilities that would normally destroy the entirety of a creature only managed to destroy the first {{SI|100|ft}} or so of its body, and any spell or other ability that relied on creatures being under a certain size simply failed to effect it at all. That said, only the end of Ugudenk, with its mouth, was capable of actually attacking. Ugudenk was known to be able to spew a {{SIAdj|600|ft}} line of acid out of its mouth, and was able to replicate the effects of the spells ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[fly]]'' at will, ''[[creeping doom]]'' and ''[[insanity]]'' thrice per day, and ''[[imprisonment]]'' and ''[[earthquake]]'' once per day.

Additionally, akin to other obyriths, any creature that saw Ugudenk was at significant risk of going mad- from the realization that Ugudenk could erupt from the ground at any time. This particular form of insanity hampered creatures ability to do anything while standing on the ground; and it could only be cured by the spells ''[[heal]]'', ''[[greater restoration]]'', ''[[miracle]]'', or ''[[wish]]''. Even creatures normally immune to fear were vulnerable to this madness, though they could shake it off after only an hour. In fact, only [[demon]]s and other chaotic evil outsiders were known to be immune.

Even if an enemy succeeded in destroying Ugudenk's mouth, the demon lord would simply pull the rest of its body back into the Writhing Realm, where it eventually regenerated the missing body part. Some believed that killing Ugudenk was impossible so long as the Writhing Realm existed; others postulated that, based on its sheer size, Ugudenk was actually an extension of an as-yet-undiscovered Abyssal layer..

==Realm==
Ugudenk "ruled" over the 177{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], an burrow-riddled underground land called the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 90: Writhing Realm|Writhing Realm]]. It was not uncommon for travelers there to encounter Ugudenk's body blocking caverns and tunnels there.

==Activities==

Ugudenk had no apparent goals or plans, spending most of its time contentedly burrowing through the Writhing Realm. It did have an odd attraction to the neighboring layer of [[Hollow's Heart]], though most considered that to be because a permanent portal existed between the two layers; the Spiral of Ugudenk on the other end was notable for being one of the few immutable parts of that realm. Hollow's Heart's ruling demon lord [[Fraz-Urb'luu]]'s consistent and consistently failed attempts to remove Ugudenk from his realm led to other demon lords joking about his "infestation problem".

At other times, Ugudenk would burst into other layers of the Abyss and, more rarely, the Material plane, where it devoured things as varied as castles, lakes, artifacts, and titans. Most saw no pattern or schedule to these anomalies, but stories were told of scholars who, after studying the nature of its seemingly random feasts, went insane and took their own lives- almost always by allowing immense monsters to devour them.

==Worshipers==
Ugudenk had no organized cult, just a few isolated maniacs who sought to draw the Squirming King's attention to people or places that they felt had wronged them.

Likewise, Ugudenk had no true servitors, though wormlike monsters and invertebrate-like obyriths were common in regions it appeared in, and the sudden appearances of such creatures always presaged its arrival, but such followers seemed more to be opportunistic scavengers following the demon lord to eat leftover scraps.
