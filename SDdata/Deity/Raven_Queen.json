        "mainbody": "The Raven Queen was an interloper goddess of death, fate, and winter from the world of Nerath. She was also a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell who was revered by the shadar-kai.\nThe Raven Queen did not possess or manifest a physical form, instead appearing as a miscellany of symbols, perceptions, and images.\nThe Raven Queen was obsessed with collecting and observing mementos and fragments of memories and essences.\nThe Raven Queen was held as an important deity within the Dawn War, and Exandrian pantheons. She was worshiped by the shadar-kai as well as by people who worship her as a goddess of fate and appeal to her to alter their fortunes.\nOne of the Raven Queens divine realms in the Shadowfell was a castle known as the Fortress of Memories. It was a place of overwhelming sorrow, overflowing with memories taken from mortals and fragments of dead deities, material objects collected by the shadar-kai and brought to her as gifts, and apparitions of creatures and places associated with strongly emotional stories. Swarms of ravens occasionally flew out of the fortress, taking her cryptic messages to the far reaches of the multiverse and acting as the Queens eyes and ears while away.\nthumb|left|300px|The Fortress of Memories, realm of the Raven Queen in the Shadowfell.\nThe Raven Queen was also said to claim a domain in the Shadowfell known as Letherna, a fortress of black ice within a frozen forest through which the souls of the deceased had to pass before reaching the afterlife, according to some versions of the World Axis cosmology.\nOn Nerath, the Raven Queen held dominion over the domains of death, fate, and winter.\nThe whole existence of the Raven Queen was focused on collecting memories and strong emotions, typically associated with loss and tragedy. To that end, she dispatched shadar-kai to the far confines of the multiverse to wait for such an event to unfold, as scouted by her ravens. Then they collected mementos, such as trinkets, memories from the living and sometimes the souls of the dead, and brought them back to her.\nThe Raven Queen also claimed domain of the souls of all shadar-kai, which always returned to her after their deaths.\nShe was said to have forged the first weapons infused with shadow magic. These sentient blades, such as the Blackrazor, were found in many locations throughout the multiverse and were capable of binding with their wielders. For that reason, the Raven Queen was a popular hexblade patron among warlocks.\nOne of the Raven Queens greatest enemies was the demon lord Orcus, who constantly sought control of the Shadowfell. He  hoped to find a weakness in her domain by discovering her true name.\nAnother devout enemy of the Raven Queen was the Oerthian lesser deity Vecna, who envied her for her unique abilities to tap into the flow of souls and to harvest knowledge. One of his goals was to overthrow the Queen and rule the entire Shadowfell from her Fortress of Memories. Vecnas servants constantly battled with the Raven Queens shadar-kai followers.\nOther wizards and necromancers craved the Raven Queens knowledge and domain over souls. Attempts at conquering the Fortress of Memories were constant, but were always thwarted by her more fanatical shadar-kai defenders.\nThe Prince of Frost hated the Raven Queen for her role in the loss of his beloved, Sharaea. The powerful fey woman had fallen in love with a mortal hero, causing him to grow jealous, and she feared for the safety of her mortal lover if she tried to deny him. She struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to cast her soul into the future, hoping that time would allow the former Sun Prince to heal, only for him to grow bitter and sorrowful, eventually turning into the Prince of Frost. The Prince delighted in usurping some of the Raven Queens power through his association with freezing death and darkness. On her part, however, the Raven Queen desired him as an exarch or even a consort.\nthumb|The symbol of the Raven Queen.\nAlthough a complete account of the Raven Queens motivations and origins was not generally known, it was believed that she was originally a much beloved elf queen from the Feywild who witnessed the conflict between Corellon and Lolth. Worried that the dispute might tear the Seldarine asunder, she rallied her followers to perform a powerful ritual in order to become a deity, so she could have the leverage to appeal to the deities senses. The ritual involved the offering of the queens followers souls and magic to add to her own power, enabling her to reach Arvandor. The followers, who called themselves shadar-kai, firmly believed that their queen was capable of reunifying the elven pantheon and the sundered elves.\nHowever, evil wizards among the queens followers attempted to divert some of the energy from the ritual to amplify their own powers. Moments before completing the ritual and reaching Arvandor, the queen reacted by punishing the wizards with a burst of divine fury. This curse corrupted the ritual into a siphon that dragged the queen and her followers into the Shadowfell, where she was instantly killed. However, thanks to her recently acquired divine powers, the queen rose from the ashes and, in her growing madness and grief, transformed the wizards into wretched avian forms known as nagpas, and banished them forever to wander the planes.\nThe queen herself was still further transformed by the corrupted ritual, her form dissolving into disconnected sensory perceptions. Moreover, both Corellon and Lolth considered her actions to be treason, so they erased the memory of her existence from all elves. In order to avoid disappearing entirely, she drew memories of her existence from the Shadowfell itself in order to sustain her identity. Over time, the subjective remains of the queen and the loose darkened memories gave rise to the entity that became known as the Raven Queen.\nAnother account of the Raven Queens origin from the world of Nerath stated that she was originally a mortal queen, a powerful warrior or sorceress who died as a victim of the plagues sent to the mortal world by an ambitious [https//www.greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Nerull god of death]. The god of death fell in love with the queen when he saw her powerful soul, and elevated her to be his consort. He renamed her \"Nera\", her true name forever lost. Nera eventually learned the secrets to gain power from the souls of mortals, and she led a rebellion against the god of death in Pluton, killing the god and usurping his throne and divinity. In order to prevent her from becoming a tyrant in the same fashion as the defeated god, other deities elevated her to the status of goddess of death, but with no power over the dead themselves. Soon after her ascension, Nera expunged her true name from the knowledge of all creatures of the cosmos and began to calling herself the Raven Queen.\nThese accounts also state that the Raven Queen helped Corellon in his fight against Lolth, by lending Corellon her army of sorrowsworn. Lolth forfeited her claim over the fate domain after being defeated, leaving it available for the Raven Queen to assume as reward for her assistance."
