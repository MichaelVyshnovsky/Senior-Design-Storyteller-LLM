        "Divine Realm": "One of the Raven Queen's [[divine realm]]s in the Shadowfell was a castle known as the [[Fortress of Memories]]. It was a place of overwhelming sorrow, overflowing with memories taken from mortals and fragments of dead deities, material objects collected by the shadar-kai and brought to her as gifts, and apparitions of creatures and places associated with strongly emotional stories. Swarms of [[raven]]s occasionally flew out of the fortress, taking her cryptic messages to the far reaches of the [[multiverse]] and acting as the Queen's eyes and ears while away.\n\n[[File:Fortress of memories-5e.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The Fortress of Memories, realm of the Raven Queen in the Shadowfell.'']]\nThe Raven Queen was also said to claim a domain in the Shadowfell known as Letherna, a fortress of black ice within a frozen forest through which the souls of the deceased had to pass before reaching the [[afterlife]], according to some versions of the [[World Axis cosmology]].",

        "Activities": "The whole existence of the Raven Queen was focused on collecting memories and strong emotions, typically associated with loss and tragedy. To that end, she dispatched shadar-kai to the far confines of the multiverse to wait for such an event to unfold, as scouted by her ravens. Then they collected mementos, such as trinkets, memories from the living and sometimes the souls of the dead, and brought them back to her.\n\nThe Raven Queen also claimed domain of the souls of all shadar-kai, which always returned to her after their deaths.\n\nShe was said to have forged the first [[weapon]]s infused with [[shadow magic]]. These sentient blades, such as the ''[[Blackrazor]]'', were found in many locations throughout the multiverse and were capable of binding with their wielders. For that reason, the Raven Queen was a popular [[hexblade patron]] among [[warlock]]s.",
        "Relationships": "One of the Raven Queen's greatest enemies was the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]], who constantly sought control of the Shadowfell. He  hoped to find a weakness in her domain by discovering her true name.\n\nAnother devout enemy of the Raven Queen was the [[Oerth]]ian [[lesser deity]] [[Vecna]], who envied her for her unique abilities to tap into the flow of souls and to harvest knowledge. One of his goals was to overthrow the Queen and rule the entire Shadowfell from her Fortress of Memories. Vecna's servants constantly battled with the Raven Queen's shadar-kai followers.\n\nOther wizards and [[necromancer]]s craved the Raven Queen's knowledge and domain over souls. Attempts at conquering the Fortress of Memories were constant, but were always thwarted by her more fanatical shadar-kai defenders.\n\nThe [[Prince of Frost]] hated the Raven Queen for her role in the loss of his beloved, [[Sharaea]]. The powerful fey woman had fallen in love with a mortal hero, causing him to grow jealous, and she feared for the safety of her mortal lover if she tried to deny him. She struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to cast her soul into the future, hoping that time would allow the former Sun Prince to heal, only for him to grow bitter and sorrowful, eventually turning into the Prince of Frost. The Prince delighted in usurping some of the Raven Queen's power through his association with freezing death and darkness. On her part, however, the Raven Queen desired him as an exarch or even a consort.{{Cite dragon/374/Court of Stars: The Prince of Frost|53-64}}",
        "History": "[[File:Raven queen-4e.jpg|thumb|''The [[Holy symbol|symbol]] of the Raven Queen.'']]\nAlthough a complete account of the Raven Queen's motivations and origins was not generally known, it was believed that she was originally a much beloved [[elf]] queen from the [[Feywild]] who witnessed the conflict between [[Corellon]] and [[Lolth]]. Worried that the dispute might tear the [[Seldarine]] asunder, she rallied her followers to perform a powerful ritual in order to become a deity, so she could have the leverage to appeal to the deities' senses. The ritual involved the offering of the queen's followers' souls and [[magic]] to add to her own power, enabling her to reach [[Arvandor]]. The followers, who called themselves shadar-kai, firmly believed that their queen was capable of reunifying the elven pantheon and the sundered elves.\n\nHowever, evil [[wizard]]s among the queen's followers attempted to divert some of the energy from the ritual to amplify their own powers. Moments before completing the ritual and reaching Arvandor, the queen reacted by punishing the wizards with a burst of divine fury. This curse corrupted the ritual into a siphon that dragged the queen and her followers into the Shadowfell, where she was instantly killed. However, thanks to her recently acquired divine powers, the queen rose from the ashes and, in her growing madness and grief, transformed the wizards into wretched avian forms known as [[nagpa]]s, and banished them forever to wander the [[planes]].\n\nThe queen herself was still further transformed by the corrupted ritual, her form dissolving into disconnected sensory perceptions. Moreover, both Corellon and Lolth considered her actions to be treason, so they erased the memory of her existence from all elves. In order to avoid disappearing entirely, she drew memories of her existence from the Shadowfell itself in order to sustain her identity. Over time, the subjective remains of the queen and the loose darkened memories gave rise to the entity that became known as the Raven Queen.\n\nAnother account of the Raven Queen's origin from the world of Nerath stated that she was originally a mortal queen, a powerful warrior or [[sorceress]] who died as a victim of the plagues sent to the mortal world by an ambitious [https://www.greyhawkonline.com/greyhawkwiki/Nerull god of death]. The god of death fell in love with the queen when he saw her powerful soul, and elevated her to be his consort. He renamed her \"Nera\", her true name forever lost. Nera eventually learned the secrets to gain power from the souls of mortals, and she led a rebellion against the god of death in [[Pluton]], killing the god and usurping his throne and divinity. In order to prevent her from becoming a tyrant in the same fashion as the defeated god, other deities elevated her to the status of goddess of death, but with no power over the dead themselves. Soon after her ascension, Nera expunged her true name from the knowledge of all creatures of the cosmos and began to calling herself the Raven Queen.\n\nThese accounts also state that the Raven Queen helped Corellon in his fight against Lolth, by lending Corellon her army of [[sorrowsworn]]. Lolth forfeited her claim over the fate domain after being defeated, leaving it available for the Raven Queen to assume as reward for her assistance."
