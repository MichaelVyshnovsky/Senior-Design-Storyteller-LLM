        "mainbody": "The '''Red Knight''' was the [[Faerûnian]] [[deity]] of strategy and battle tactics and an [[exarch]] of [[Tempus]], Lord of Battle. \n\n{{Quote|Before her time as an exarch of Tempus and goddess of Strategy, the Red Knight was a [[paladin]] most devout. She toured armies the world over as both student and teacher, and thus was she elevated by Tempus to her current status.|An excerpt from ''[[The Red Knight's Final Strategem]]''}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Red Knight 3e.png|thumb|''Red Knight's armored avatar.'']]\nThe Red Knight always appeared in blood-red [[plate mail]], her presence commanding attention and respect. Her long braids of dark hair streamed out behind her while her eyes gleamed like ruby stars.",
        "Personality": "The Red Knight was possessed of a calm and logical bearing, rarely raising her voice and unafraid of sending her worshipers to their death if necessary for her plans. She disliked fickleness and did not appreciate those that switched allegiance constantly or capriciously. She was not a heartless goddess however, displaying a great wealth of compassion and said to love a good joke, responding with a throaty laugh.",
        "Relationships": "The Red Knight looked to [[Tempus]] as a father figure and spent a great amount of time with him. Most often they were busy visiting ongoing battles in Faerun or reviewing those of the past, but they were also known to simply hunt together or share stories in his feasting hall. and only him who knew her true name.\n\nThe Red Knight saw [[Valkur]], the god of sailors, as her best ally in the disposition of naval conflicts, and had tried to persuade him into taking more interest in doing so. Valkur meanwhile felt his primary duty was the protection of sailors, and she sometimes expected him to show more than his demonstrated willingness to commit to anything besides this (although he did become an [[exarch]] of Tempus as she did during the [[Spellplague]]).\n\nAnother ally of the Red Knight was [[Torm]], who had begun forging a close relationship with the Red Knight at the urging of his superior [[Tyr]] in the hopes of tempering her lust for war with an appreciation of justice.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|162-165}} The two were similar in disposition, had interests (namely fighting and the duties of warriors) that coincided well, and she was known to be fond of him. Whether they were simply close friends or actually in love was a matter they kept to themselves.\n\nThe Red Knight reserved her greatest animosity for [[Cyric]]; even if she didn't despise him as the utmost of traitors and deceivers, the Lady of Strategy would still deem him a poor planner. Though she disliked [[Garagos]], the Red Knight had not personally come to blows with him. Her distaste for Garagos was based in what Tempus had told her of him, and some speculated that Tempus granted the Red Knight her divinity so that she could serve as his natural counterbalance.",
        "Worshipers": "{{Main|Church of the Red Knight}}The Red Knight was worshiped by generals, tacticians, lawful-minded [[warriors]] and [[paladins]] alike. Her symbol was a red knight [[Chess (game)|chess]] piece with stars for eyes.",
        "Rituals": {
            "The Retreat": "On Midwinter Day the Red Fellowship observed the Retreat. This solemn ceremony consisted of an assembly wherein the clergy discussed the previous year's campaigns. Strategies were discussed, battles analyzed, and the accumulated lore integrated into the church's teachings.",
            "The Queen's Gambit": "On the 1st of [[Tarsakh]], the clergy of the Red Knight held an annual festival called the Queen's Gambit. During this day-long extravaganza, the Red Fellowship unwound with feasting and gaming. Day-long tournaments of chess (also known as lanceboard, hence the Red Knight's second title, \"Grandmaster of the Lanceboard\") were held, with the tournament victors receiving recognition, titles of merit, promotions, and occasionally a gift from the temple armory."
        },
        "History": "[[Image:Red-Knight_symbol.jpg|thumb|250px|''The [[holy symbol]] of the Red Knight.'']]\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], the Red Knight's avatar possessed Lady [[Kaitlin Tindall Bloodhawk]]. While possessed, she and her adventuring band traveled to [[Tethyr]] and successfully repelled a large army of monsters, earning the nation's gratitude. However, she returned to her clan's stronghold to find it destroyed. She reconstructed the fort and declared it a temple to the Red Lady, and from then on it was known as the [[Citadel of Strategic Militancy]]. In time, it became the center of worship for the Church of the Red Knight. Bloodhawk continued to lead the [[Order of the Red Falcon]], a small knightly order worshiping the Red Knight that trained officers and others in tactics and military history.\n\nThe Red Knight, or the Red Lady as she was known locally, was the patron of the ruling family of [[Ankhapur]] and her clergy trusted with the care of the Cup and Knife - the traditional symbols of the King's authority. This patronage ended in [[1366 DR]], when [[Janol Famisso]] took the throne and chose to favor [[Lathander]]. Of note is that in Ankhapur, the Red Knight was venerated by some as the Red Lord, a male deity, as opposed to elsewhere where she is exclusively considered female."
