Kalzareinad was the dragon demigod of dragon magic, in particular the selfish, uncaring, or evil application of it. 
Before his death, Kalzareinad was on somewhat friendly terms with Null.
Kalzareinad is said to have aided Sammaster in creating the first dracolich. 
In 1358 DR, the dragon goddess Kereska subsumed the entirety of his portfolio and worshipers. Kalzreinads corpse appeared on the Astral Plane shortly thereafter.
