        "mainbody": "'''Khurgorbaeyag''', also known as '''Kuro''' to the [[Batiri]], was the [[goblin]] [[god]] of oppression and social order, and the last remaining member of the [[goblin pantheon]] after [[Maglubiyet]] destroyed all the others. Known as The Overseer due to his supervisory role, he was responsible for the goblin penchant for taking slaves.",
        "Description": "Khurgorbaeyag appeared as a muscular, {{SI|9|ft}} tall goblin with flame-red skin flecked with orange and yellow scales, always wielding his signature [[whip]] and wearing [[scale mail]] armor. He was also known to appear to [[batiri|jungle goblins]] as a powerful [[ankylosaurus]].",
        "Personality": "Khurgorbaeyag was a cruel taskmaster",
        "Powers": "Khurgobaeyag's supernatural abilities centered around subjugation, as he charmed and dominated masses of enemies to submit to his will. He himself was immune to spells meant to demoralize or enthrall him. He was known to be of great physical prowess.",
        "Possessions": "Khurgobaeyag's only weapon was his great whip, which he used to \"motivate\" good performance from his goblins in both civilian and war duties. The whip had all the powers of a ''[[rope of entanglement]]'' was three times as durable, but had the added benefit of producing supersonic snaps when used multiple times in short succession. It's most dangerous, if not deadly, feature, was that those struck by the whip were filled with despair, similarly to how a [[symbol of hopelessness]] worked, compelling them to promptly surrender to the wielder. If the victim couldn't resist, they could stay in a depressed state anywhere between a week and several months, depending on their willpower.\n\nHe was also known to possess small [[copper]] cubes, that could be thrown at his foes and expand into a 10 x 10 x {{SI|10|ft}} [[forcecage]], after which they would be exposed to the effects of a symbol of hopelessness, although the effect could be resisted as well.",
        "Divine Realm": "Khurgorbaeyag dwelt with the rest of the goblin pantheon on the first layer of [[Acheron]], [[Avalas]], on the cube of [[Clangor]], the greatest goblin barracks in the multiverse. He lived in the fortress city of [[Shetring]] which also housed his greatest temple.",
        "Activities": "Given that Maglubiyet was more concerned with warfare and destruction than the welfare of the [[goblinoid]] races, it fell to Khurgorbaeyag to ensure the survival and expansion of the goblin race specifically. Regardless of his task, he had his own agenda that he secretly worked towards.",
        "Relationships": "Khurgorbaeyag was the lowest-ranking goblinoid deity, under the chief deity Maglubiyet, the general [[Nomog-Geaya]], and the peacekeeper [[Bargrivyek]] and lacking the relative freedom of the somewhat independent but still subservient [[bugbear]] deities. Among them, his best relationship was doubtlessly with his immediate superior Bargrivyek, the two of them sharing ideals concerning goblinoid unity and ascendancy. Meanwhile, his rival among the pantheon was Nomog-Geaya, who despite being his superior he wouldn't bow towards, the [[hobgoblin]] god himself regarding Khurgorbeayag with barely restrained disgust. Khurgorbaeyag competed with Nomog-Geaya for Maglubiyet's favor with intent to prove his people more worthy of the Battle Lord's good graces.\n\nThough the paranoid Maglubiyet showed a comparatively high level of trust towards Khurgorbaeyag, this was because the Overseer acted as loyal as possible to his liege, but not out of any sense of true fealty. Khurgorbaeyag obeyed Maglubiyet because he had seen what the Battle Lord did to anyone he perceived as a threat, and being the kind of god he was, Maglubiyet saw threats everywhere. Fear only worked so well as a motivator and Khurgorbaeyag planned to usurp his tyrannical master as soon as he could concoct a flawless plan to do so.\n\nThe bugbear god [[Hruggek]] had something akin to an alliance him since he once aided the Master of Ambush in a battle between the orc gods [[Bahgtru]] and [[Ilneval]], and the two still occasionally worked together to fight lesser [[orc]]ish gods. Khurgorbaeyag was the one goblinoid deity that Hruggek wasn't afraid of watching his actions and he was known to secretly compliment the goblin gods plans from time to time. Despite tolerating him however, the cunning Hruggek talked about how sound his plans, and reversely how uninspired Maglubiyet's were, to encourage division between members of the pantheon to secure more resources for his own bugbears.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Tribes": "Khurgorbaeyag was the most widely worshiped god of the [[Batiri]]. Although many goblin tribes worshiped Khurgorbaeyag, the [[Kuro]] tribe of [[Chult]] were solely dedicated to him, and knew him as Kuro. They believed that he owned the jungle and could take the form of a huge and powerful dinosaur.",
            "Other Gods": "As a result of their mutual understanding, Hruggek and Khurgorbaeyag's shamans were allowed to work together in relative harmony, in other words, cautious cooperation. The two held joint ceremonies at times and bugbear guards could be frequently be found guarding Khurgorbaeyag's temples. Conversely, goblin and hobgoblin shamans of Khurgorbaeyag and Nomog-Geaya respectively, mutually detested each other, goblin shamans referencing Nomog-Geaya's subtle treacheries and hobgoblin shamans making thinly veiled references to their god's barely contained disgust for Khurgorbaeyag. While the Overseer's shamans claimed that goblin [[petitioner]]s had to fight all the harder in the goblin afterlife against the orcs do to the clumsy, lazy hobgoblin petitioners, the General's shamans claimed that hobgoblin petitioners had to do the same as a result of the weak, dishonorable goblin petitioners."
        },
        "History": "Khurgorbaeyag was once part of the goblin pantheon that ruled over the goblins, until the day Maglubiyet slaughtered all the other deities. Maglubiyet left only a single member of the goblin pantheon, Khurgorbaeyag, alive. Maglubiyet made him the cruel overseer of his goblin worshipers, whilst he took the chief position of all the goblinoid deities.\n\nKhurgorbaeyag once managed to trap the [[gnome]] deity of illusion and deception, [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], but they later escaped and got their revenge, beginning their trend of never following the same routine and always wearing a different disguise."
