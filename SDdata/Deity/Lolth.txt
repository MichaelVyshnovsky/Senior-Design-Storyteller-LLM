'''Lolth''' ({{Pronounce|lalth|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}} {{Pronounce|lolth|refs=|alt=yes}}), or '''Lloth''', known as the '''Queen of Spiders''' as well as the '''Queen of the Demonweb Pits''', was the most influential [[deity|goddess]] of the [[drow]], within the pantheon of the [[Dark Seldarine]].
{{Quote
|Station is the way of Lolth, the ambition she bestows to further the chaos, to keep her drow "children" along their appointed course of self imprisonment.
|[[Drizzt Do'Urden]]
}}

==Description==
Lolth could appear either as a {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} diameter, crimson-eyed black widow [[spider]], or a {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall, beautiful female drow often garbed entirely in clinging spiders or sometimes in artful, drow [[chainmail]] dresses or tunics. The form most commonly found in the Abyss however, thought to be her true form, was a combination of the others, a giant spider with the head of a coldly beautiful female drow.

==Personality==
Lolth was a goddess of cold cruelty not out of place in the darkest depths of the endless Abyss, and toying with everyone from her minions to her victims.{{Cite dragon/408/History Check: Corellon and Gruumsh|7}}

Lolth demanded absolute fealty and obedience from all drow,

Despite her demands for loyalty, those who blindly obeyed Lolth's demands would find themselves quickly led to their deaths. In truth, Lolth's capricious nature meant that there were few hard-and-fast rules, and much uncertainty as to her desires. The successful had to pay attention to her ever-changing wants, for her favor was fickle, The Spider Queen was technically capable of displays of kindness and aiding those she fancied, and would always give one chance for the disfavored to redeem themselves, but this usually meant a dangerous mission and in others might just mean silently watching their next move. She could never be relied on and her ultimate motivation was almost always manipulative.

Lolth's promotion of infighting amongst her worshipers led many to believe she was insane, and this assessment was not baseless. Indeed, ever since her fall from grace her sanity had frayed and fractured until she became the petty, conniving monster she was commonly known as. Her will was not merely fluid, but often times contradictory, Ironically, for all her demands for obedience, nothing demanded her attention and admiration more than treachery, even towards herself (if only temporarily). Guile and political ruthlessness were the signs of her favorite servants, and she ultimately admired ambition more than she did loyalty.

==Relationships==
Lolth disdained planar beings less powerful than herself, viewing them as either pawns or foes. At the same time, she held those more powerful than herself in contempt, coveting the status of the most powerful beings and seeking to ascend to their station through deception, betrayal, and murder.

===The Dark Seldarine===
[[File:Dark Seldarine - F&P.jpg|370x370px|thumb|right|The Dark Seldarine, with Lolth in the center.]]
Lolth was the leader of the [[Dark Seldarine]], but was opposed to varying degrees by all other members of it. She was the mother of both [[Eilistraee]] and [[Vhaeraun]], along with [[Vandria Gilmadrith|Vandria]], though the latter never supported the acts of her mother or joined the Dark Seldarine.<ref>

====Vhaeraun====
On one hand, Lolth encouraged her son's rivalry with her, for it appealed to her love of chaos. On the other hand, her son's successes at swaying the drow to his cause of destroying her, her followers, and her version of society, led her to consider him a threat. (the largest on the surface), and was an ever expanding force,{{cite web

}} to the point that Lolth considered Vhaeraun her real enemy and rival.

The two had no common ground: Lolth promoted favoritism towards females, while the Masked Lord urged his followers to cooperate with surface elves; Lolth ordered her followers to keep [[drow]] society stagnant in every regard, while Vhaeraun attracted those who wanted change in their societal progress, economic growth, and territorial expansion; while Vhaeraun encouraged settling the surface.

Vhaeraun's [[masked traitor]]s, clerical spies Lolth had mistakenly believed members of her own clergy, were enough of a problem that she considered their discovery, and warning her clergy of their existence, worthy of her personal attention. Indeed, Lolth, who normally gave worshipers of other drow gods a second chance on being found out, made an exception for Vhaeraun's followers, who were killed right away.

====Other Enemies in the Dark Seldarine====
[[Image:Lolth symbol - Mike Schely.jpg|thumb|383x383px|right|The holy symbol of Lolth, Queen of Spiders.]]
The other members of the Dark Seldarine were generally of minor importance and Lolth's behavior towards them could be described as derisive.

She considered her daughter [[Eilistraee]] to be an inconsequential fool, a moody girl who could be easily manipulated into serving her ends. The epithet used by Eilistraee's followers' to describe Lolth was "the Tyrant Poisoner".

[[Ghaunadaur]] was a different matter. She feared the possibility that he could sway the drow towards his cause, but he did not care enough for drow matters to attract many of them.

====Allies in the Dark Seldarine====
[[Kiaransalee]] and [[Selvetarm]] were her allies (and the only ones in the drow pantheon), who acted as her servants. The latter was Lolth's grandchild and her (self-appointed) champion. Selvetarm was practically enslaved to her, but was quite comfortable under her rule,

===Others===
====The Seldarine====
Lolth was an enemy of the [[Seldarine]], especially of [[Corellon Larethian]], her former husband, [[Sehanine Moonbow]], for the part she played in foiling her scheme to overthrow Corellon, and [[Fenmarel Mestarine]], who was her partner in adultery but ultimately did not join her betrayal. While her hatred was deep, she did not actually put any significant effort into acting on it, preferring to keep the drow engaged in deep infighting, rather than united against those whom she considered her enemies.

====Other Enemies====
She once helped [[Gruumsh]] to attempt to kill [[Corellon Larethian]], but after he failed, they later became enemies. She also was the enemy of a long list of [[Underdark]] deities.

====Other Allies====
Lolth had occasional alliances with [[Loviatar]] and [[Malar]]. Some believed there may have been an ancient pact between Lolth and the [[duergar]] deity [[Laduguer]], due to his race's use of [[steeder]]s and her having never been known to use them as minions.

==Worshipers==

}}
Lolth's follower base was varied. It mainly consisted of [[drow]], She gained a few [[elf|elven]] followers, and tried to gain more worshipers by assuming the aspect of [[Moander]], a [[deity]] of rot.

Lolth drove her worshipers into heavy infighting under the pretense of culling the weak, while her actual goals were to hold absolute control over the [[dark elves]], prevent the rise of alternative faiths or ideas, and avoid complacency (even though she found amusement in the strife that plagued her followers' communities). However, in the long run, her influence proved to be an obstacle to the growth and success of her drow followers, preventing them from unifying against common enemies or for a common cause.

Any attempt by the drow to emulate Lolth was doomed to fail, for unlike other humanoids, their arachnid deity was without their form or psychology. They were ashamed that they could not fully live up to her demands, and in truth, the Spider Queen was one they could never truly please. Any boon she granted to them was only in service to escalating conflict and causing further strife, and in the end, she cared nothing for them.

===Clerics===
{{fq

|text=Ascension to power in drow society is a simple process of assassination. The Spider Queen is a deity of chaos, and she and her high priestesses, the true rulers of the drow world, do not look with ill favor upon ambitious individuals wielding poisoned daggers.
|source=Drizzt Do'Urden
}}
Lolth's [[clerics]] were almost exclusively female (although there were a few males). They represented the rulers of most Lolthite communities, and strictly followed the Spider Queen's will, forcing the drow into extreme subservience to their deity, and into the constant state of conflict that dominated their lives. Each priestess strove for the favor of the Spider Queen and was ready to do anything in order to gain status in her goddess' eyes. Her clergy sacrificed the living and treasure for her glory. Their vestments were normally adorned with spider motifs. Her rituals required them to wear darker clothes or none at all.

===Orders===
;Militant Myrlochar, Order of Soul Spiders
The [[Militant Myrlochar]], sometimes known as the Order of Soul Spiders, was an elite fighting organization composed exclusively of male [[crusader]]s, and found in the dark elven cities where Lolth was worshiped and males were allowed entrance into her priesthood. They directly served the reigning [[Matron Mother]]s of the city and were employed to kill their targets. They were usually used without pause until they got killed.

;Handmaidens of the Spider Queen
The [[Handmaidens of the Spider Queen]] were an order of female crusaders. Also called the "Daughters of the [[Yochlol]]", they had no ties to specific cities, and were used when Lolth wanted an entire city to brought back into line. At least three times in recorded history did the Handmaidens of the Spider Queen destroy entire drow cities to prevent them from straying too far from Lolth. One of their usual tasks was to terrorize merchants who took [[Vhaeraun]] as their patron, as well as settlements run by the [[church of Vhaeraun|followers of Vhaeraun]] or [[Ghaunadaur]]'s (or where those faiths were prominent).

==History==
===Dawn Age===
Before her fall, Lolth was known as Araushnee, the lesser elven [[goddess]] of destiny and artisans. She was consort to Corellon, leader of all the elf deities, Unflinching as the fallen night, she too had played a part in the creation of the earliest elves; her cutting jests brought forth tears of laughter from Corellon from which mortal fey were spawned, as did Sehanine's arcing acrobatics. Sometimes the laughter between the three was dark and mocking, but more often, it was true and heartfelt.

Araushnee would become the main goddess of the dark elves, whose nightly complexion matched her own, as well as a third child, [[Vandria Gilmadrith]].<ref>

====War of the Seldarine====
{{quote|''Yet another sign of Corellon’s weakness. He should have slain the orc when he had the chance. I would have. Or, at the very least, I would have gelded him!''|Lolth commenting on Corellon sparing Gruumsh's life.}}<br/>

The events regarding Lolth's rebellion were lost to time and the timelessness of the [[Feywild]], and too distorted by shadows and echoes for anyone to be sure of her first betrayal. Not even the likes of Sehanine or Corellon could say if she had always thought differently to them, or if there had been some kind of inciting incident. Some divinations suggest the troubles dated back to before [[Arvandor]] was even complete, when the [[orc]] god [[Gruumsh]], Corellon's long-standing rival, tried to destroy it. Though she respected his wish to face Gruumsh alone, she secretly admired his rage, and at some point dallied with him.{{Cite dragon/359/1d20 Villains: D&D's Most Wanted; Preferably Dead|66}}

Whatever the reason or chronology, Araushnee grew jealous of her husband and discontent with her station. Slowly, over the course of her treachery, her connection to the elves would weaken.

During her first attempt, she aided [[Gruumsh]] in trying to kill her husband by imbuing the [[scabbard]] that he had crafted for his sword with magic that would cause the weapon to shatter during the fight. she knew that Araushnee had tampered with the scabbard, because the Weaver had conducted this very first step of her betrayal during the night, when Sehanine's sight could reach her.

Later, Araushnee agitated [[Malar]] into attacking the wounded Corellon
{{fq
|text=I name you, Araushnee, traitor to the Seldarine.
|source=Sehanine Moonbow
}}
Araushnee's next move was to gather a host of gods on hostile footing with the Seldarine, forming an army to assault Arvandor and overthrow Corellon. The army itself was so badly organized, that she was confident that they would fail. Her true plan was to give the cursed scabbard back to Corellon, as during the battle that would later unfold, the item would cause arrows shot by Eilistraee to hit his chest instead. According to Lolth's plan, that would have killed Corellon while turning her daughter into a scapegoat.

Before the attack by the anti-Seldarine faction was ready, Sehanine confronted Araushnee about her betrayal (as mentioned above, she knew Araushnee to be a traitor), Together, they also made sure that Eilistraee would find and deliver the scabbard to Corellon, and that she would be in his vicinity during the battle.

Once the battle started, the Weaver's plan almost went as she expected, supported even further by [[Ghaunadaur]]'s entrance. When an ogre god charged Corellon, who had been immobilized by the Elder Eye, Eilistraee swiftly fired a few arrows to save her father, but the scabbard drew the projectiles towards the Protector instead, nearly slaying him. However her plan ultimately failed due to Sehanine's intervention, as the Lady of Dreams had managed to break out from Vhaeraun's prison, albeit at immense cost to herself.

}}
When the elven lord awakened, a trial was called in. Vhaeraun and Eilistraee became members in exile of the Seldarine — willingly in the case of Eilistraee, as she had foreseen that the dark elves would have needed her light and hope in the future. Araushnee meanwhile was stripped of all but a sliver of her divinity and transformed into a [[tanar'ri]] with the form of a giant spider. Corellon could not bring himself to destroy her, and instead banished her to the Abyss, bidding her to join the [[demons]] she had come to resemble. Furious for her defeat, she made one last attempt on her lover's life, but was thwarted and bested by her husband. Despite all, the Protector still loved her and still could not bring himself to finish her off, allowing her to escape into the opened portal into the realm of demons.

===Aftermath===
After her exile, Araushnee took the name "Lolth". She conquered the 66th layer of the [[Abyss]], the [[Demonweb Pits]], for herself. 

After securing control over her layer, she plotted to exact vengeance against Corellon. Being unable to directly strike at him, she planned to be worshiped as a goddess by the elves, bringing misery to them and therefore to their "father". When the [[moon elf]] [[Kethryllia Amarillis]] came to retrieve her lover in the [[Abyss]] during a battle for the city of [[Sharlarion]], Lolth became interested in the world the elf came from, [[Toril]]. She sensed the presence of [[Vhaeraun]], at that time the major [[deity]] in [[Ilythiir]], and her attention was drawn there. Her fascination grew as she witnessed the Ilythiiri, at the time under [[Ka'Narlist]], preparing for war when Kethryllia had unknowingly revealed their position to them. Lolth admired the old mage's craftiness and he became her first worshiper and consort.

Ilythiir, the southern empire, was much to her liking, as it was richer and more cosmopolitan, but mainly because of the fierceness of its people, of their ambitions, and of their ability to act on those.

===First Flowering===
[[File:Lolth_p82.jpg|300px|thumb|Queen of the Demonweb Pits.]]
Originally, [[Ilythiir]] and the other elven nations were not on openly hostile footing, but Lolth poisoned this relationship by causing wars and strife. This led the elves to decide to create a dark elf-free piece of land. They caused the First Sundering, which split a region of the [[Faerûn|continent]] from the mainland in order to create an island out of it, a process which caused countless victims, a large part of the [[church of Vhaeraun]] among them. Vhaeraun's efforts to remedy this were undermined by the ongoing conflict between him and Eilistraee, granting Lolth and Ghaunadaur the opportunity to fill the void. The Spider Queen then started her machinations that would eventually lead to the Crown Wars.

One legend of the half-elven [[Crinti]] of the [[Shining South]] told a story of the Ilythiiri wizard whose name was lost to time. She was only known as the [[Spider Queen (wizard)|Spider Queen]]. According to the legend, the wizard stumbled across the veil and into the realm of the [[Unseelie Court]] where she learned their dark fey magics by unfortunate firsthand experiences. She was imprisoned and tormented but serendipitously escaped the fey realm. The Spider Queen was believed to have been driven insane by the fell magics but gained unimaginable power, becoming the most powerful spell-caster in Ilythiir. Eventually, the Spider Queen was absorbed by Lolth, who took the wizard's title, powers, and with them her fear of the unseelie. Lolth ended up passing that compulsory fear of the unseelie music onto her drow children and subsequently onto the Crinti half-elves. This lore was preserved within the tomes found in libraries of [[Halruaa]].

===Crown Wars===
For Lolth, the [[Crown Wars]] were an opportunity to gain control over the dark elves and at the same time exact vengeance against the Seldarine.

Lolth's church grew in prominence during the Second Crown War. At that time, [[Aryvandaar]], the [[sun elf]] nation, had started a military campaign against dark elves of [[Miyeritar]] (which would later culminate in the genocidal [[Dark Disaster]]). Both to avenge their Miyearitari cousins, and in fear that Aryvandaar could similarly lay waste on Ilythiir, the Ilythiiri joined the conflict against the elven empire. The Ilythiiri [[coronal]] summoned [[Wendonai]], a [[balor]] in service of Lolth, and bought power from it. Lolth swiftly acted, using this golden opportunity to get the dark elves under her control.

Other noble families of Ilythiir followed their royalty's example, summoning further demonic allies sent by Vhaeraun, Kiaransalee and Ghaunadaur,

At that time, the Ilythiiri were still refining their worship. They knew that Lolth was a spider deity, and that the other five gods and goddesses, who would later become known as the [[Dark Seldarine]], (with the exception of [[Selvetarm]], who was not born yet) These efforts to put the drow deities in this relation in each other were considered so offensive by the depicted, that Lolth, Vhaeraun, Ghaundaur and Kiaransalee killed their high priests for it.

During the Fourth Crown War, the elves' wish for divine salvation, the worship of Lolth who was starting to spread among the Ilythiiri, and the taint of Wendonai which had corrupted their leaders, caused the elves to gather at the Elven Court and summon the power of the Seldarine to curse the dark elves and turn them into [[drow]] (even innocent ones and the followers of Eilistraee, who had already been exterminated by the Aryvandaari). The combined forces of the remaining elven nations then violently chased the newly formed race underground.

===Era of Upheaval===
[[File:Lolth_symbol.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The symbol of Lolth, during the [[Era of Upheaval]].]]
Once in the [[Underdark]], the drow lived in a borderline animal state. With Eilistraee's power nearly collapsed due to the loss of so many of her people, and with Vhaeraun's, Kiaransalee's and Ghaunadaur's power being unable to compete with Lolth's, she became the main drow deity. She gathered them together and urged them into the foundation of their first city, [[Telantiwar]]. It later destroyed itself through infighting, causing the drow to spread throughout the Underdark.

A thorn in her side was a [[demon lord]] called [[Zanassu]], who claimed dominion over spiders. Lolth got rid of him by using Selvetarm, her grandchild who was born from Vhaeraun and [[Zandilar]] when the Spider Queen's followers attacked the [[Yuirwood]]. Lolth convinced Selvetarm that killing the demon would have made Eilistraee, whom had befriended him, and whom he had come to admire, so he fought and defeated Zanassu, but ended up absorbing his power and being bound to Lolth's will in the process. Lolth thus solved two problems: one of her rivals was gone, and her daughter was prevented from getting an ally.

===Time of Troubles===
During the [[Time of Troubles]], apart from appearing in [[Menzoberranzan]] and assuming the aspect of [[Moander]] to attract more surface elves, [[humans]], and [[half-elves]], Lolth spread information on [[Zinzerena]], a [[deity|goddess]] from another world. When she appeared on [[Toril]], Lolth killed her, gaining the portfolios of chaos and assassination, and learning how the distribution and absorption of divine energy worked under [[Ao]]'s new rules.
[[File:Flame sword of lolth.jpg|thumb|''The fabled [[Flame Sword of Lolth]].''|299x299px]]
In [[1369 DR]], Lolth guided one of her High Priestesses, [[Azurna]] in search of the ''[[Flame Sword of Lolth]]'' to establishing a presence in [[Undermountain]]. The ''Flame Sword'' was a powerful artifact created by the Queen of Spiders during the [[War of the Seldarine]]. The sword held immense power and was able to cut through the Planes. Upon her defeat, the elven gods took the sword, and eventually, it was hidden within Undermountain by [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. In [[1370 DR]], Azurna successfully assembled the ''spider statue'' that blocked the vault of the sword, allowing Lolth to manifest her giant drider avatar and tried to reclaim the item. She was confronted by an adventurer agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]], and the avatar was defeated. In the subsequent release of divine energy, ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' disappeared, slipping from the goddess' grasp once again.

===War of the Spider Queen===
The War of the Spider Queen was a period during which Lolth transformed herself into a [[greater deity]], turned the [[Demonweb Pits]] into an independent plane.

====Silence of Lolth====
In [[1372 DR]], Lolth suddenly became silent, starting an event know as "[[Silence of Lolth]]". She became completely inactive and no longer granted spells or communed with her followers.

Vhaeraun took advantage of the situation and tried to assassinate his mother. She was seriously injured, but later saved by Selvetarm.

When she finally awoke in [[1373 DR]], she called for three candidates to become her [[Chosen]]{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|234-241}} and finalize her transformation:{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|217-222}} [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], [[Quenthel Baenre]] and [[Halisstra Melarn]].{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|298-302}} However, in the Demonweb Pits, after being defeated by the other two, Halisstra converted back to Lolth.{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|4001-4029}}

Out of the three, Danifae was chosen to become part of the Spider Queen, Quenthel was sent back home{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|5221-5234}} and Halisstra was made Lolth's Lady Penitent,{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|5278-5281}} her Chosen, whose duty was to hunt and kill followers of Eilistraee and Vhaeraun.

====The Reckoning====
In [[1375 DR]], Lolth convinced Eilistraee to play a game of ''[[sava]]'' with the players' lives (and therefore the very fate of the drow) at stake. Eilistraee accepted, seeing an opportunity to free the drow from Lolth's web once and for all, despite the great risk she'd be taking. Lolth's strategy involved the employment of only two powerful servants of hers: Halisstra Melarn and [[Wendonai]]. Vhaeraun, her son, came up with a new plan to kill her. He wanted to assassinate his sister and unite their churches to increase his power and become strong enough to kill his mother. Halisstra Melarn managed to get her hands on [[Malvag]], the organizer of Vhaeraun's plot. Lolth ordered her Chosen to ensure his survival, and she went as far as reviving him after he was killed by [[Cavatina Xarann]], a priestess of Eilistraee, to ensure that Vhaeraun would have a chance at attacking his sister. When that happened, Eilistraee emerged victorious and took her brother's portfolio and the title of Masked Lady, while Vhaeraun supposedly died.<ref group="note">''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' explicitly says that Vhaeraun's assassination attempt failed and Eilistraee killed him. However, in [http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=19841&whichpage=22#476639 one of his answers], [[Ed Greenwood]] suggests that Eilistraee actually spared her brother's life. The Dark Maiden defeated Vhaeraun with the indirect help of her ally [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], as the [[Weave]] frustrated the Masked Lord's magic while enhancing Eilistraee's. The goddess temporarily took her brother's portfolio, and trapped his sentience in the Weave, where it was enfolded in a dream by Mystra. The ''Lady of Mysteries'' did that to ensure that the two drow siblings would survive the cataclysm that she knew was coming—the [[Spellplague]]—in which she would be "killed" to renew the Weave, and magic would go wild.

Meanwhile, Lolth's Chosen, There the priestess killed Selvetarm with the Crescent Blade. This event later caused his church to be completely absorbed into Lolth's: the Spider Queen claimed that Selvetarm's loss was part of her plan, and Eilistraee too was led to believe it.

When Cavatina returned from the Demonweb, [[Qilué Veladorn]] took possession of the Wendonai-possessed Crescent Blade. Qilué recognized an evil presence in the weapon and planned to banish it, but the demon successfully convinced her to not act on it, for it would have destroyed the blade. Wendonai also let himself seemingly be killed by Cavatina, which put the balor above suspicion of other followers of Eilistraee. He would remain at Qilué's side for the next few years, although the High Priestess of Eilistraee also started to hatch a plan to actually kill the [[balor]] by taking him into herself and using her [[Silver Fire]] to destroy him.

Meanwhile, Kiaransalee joined the game in [[1377 DR]]. The ensuing battle between Eilistraee and the Revenancer resolved in favor of the Dark Maiden:

Ghaunadaur joined the conflict in [[1378 DR]], planning to attack Eilistraee in order to free his avatar trapped under her temple of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden|Promenade]]. Qilué agreed to a risky plan to protect the temple from the followers of Ghaunadaur: and the temple was lost. Through its portal network the slime god's followers managed to kill many members of the church of Eilistraee. Lolth also unleashed Halisstra on her daughter's worshipers, inflicting great losses that culminated in the following year.

In fact, in [[1379 DR]], Eilistraee—while inhabiting the body of Qilué Veladorn—tried to free Halisstra from Lolth's clutches and convince her to kill the Spider Queen. However, Wendonai successfully nudged Halisstra into slaying Qilué and, apparently, the Masked Lady with her.<ref group="note">In the [http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=19841&whichpage=22#476639 same answer] mentioned in the previous note, Ed Greenwood hints that Eilistraee actually managed to survive Halisstra's attempt to kill her, albeit much weakened. When Qilué Veladorn was killed, since the Masked Lady was inhabiting her body, a great part of her power was dragged into the [[Weave]] with the Chosen's soul (the souls of Mystra's chosen often become "Voices in the Weave" after their death, as explained in the novel [[Spellstorm (novel)|''Spellstorm'']], and their memories and experiences are shared by Mystra). After that, for about a century, Eilistraee could only manfest herself as a floating black mask surrounded by moonlight, capable of silently communicating with mortals, but not of answering prayers or granting spells (except by direct touch). After Mystra and the Weave were completely restored in [[1487 DR]], the goddess of magic could finally give Eilistraee her own lost power, and do the same with Vhaeraun, after having awakened him from his dream. Lolth then left Halisstra to die, because she had exhausted her use as a Chosen.

Meanwhile, Q'arlynd Melarn's managed to cast a second [[elven high magic]] spell, which he had been preparing with Qilué Veladorn. The intent was to turn all drow of the church of Eilistraee into [[dark elf|dark elves]], but only few hundreds of the few thousands worshipers of Eilistraee (which she had as a lesser deity) were changed. Corellon took the souls of the transformed ones (and only the transformed ones) under his protection and into his portion of [[Arvandor]] (even though Eilistraee's realm, which continued existing, Corellon's servant [[Solar]]s claimed that, with this act, there was no more need for Eilistraee: to Corellon, all the willing drow had been saved, while the unwilling were cast down and left in Lolth's clutches as a necessary sacrifice.

[[File:Queen_of_the_Demonweb_Pits.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The Spider Queen fights off surface elves.]]
As her final move, Lolth tried to kill Ghaunadaur. The attempt failed, as the ooze god proved to be stronger than expected.

===Post-Spellplague===
In the following century, Lolth enjoyed a position of supremacy among the drow. She did suffer opposition from the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], the [[skulker of Vhaeraun|skulkers of Vhaeraun]]—the term used to describe those members of the [[church of Vhaeraun]] who retained divine magic despite their [[Vhaeraun|god's]] death—and the followers of Ghaunadaur.{{Cite dragon/413/Character Themes: Fringes of Drow Society}} The latter group was however a dying force, at least among drow, for Lolth successfully extinguished the knowledge about that god.

At some point in the years leading up to [[1479 DR]], Lolth ordered her servants to begin collecting [[blueflame ghost|blue fire]] items and relics important to [[Mystra]] in order to use them to craft her own [[Demon Weave]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|2765}} Her ultimate goal was to become the new goddess of magic,{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|3549}} but she ended up failing with the return of Mystra.{{Cite digital book/Archmage/Kindle|4754-4757}} In truth, Lolth's plan was doomed to fail from its conception, because she lacked the competence and understanding to sustain a Weave. In fact, despite her efforts, Lolth wasn't actually creating her own Weave; she was merely leeching off the remaining strands of Mystra's, which acted as a barrier between [[Toril]] and another cataclysm: one of such an immensity that it could have wreaked havoc across the whole planet and its Underdark.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)/Demon Weave}} Lolth's incompetence left the Weave on the verge of total collapse, and forced some of the then active [[Chosen of Mystra]] to sustain Lolth's construct on her behalf, unbeknownst to her, until Mystra recovered and reclaimed the Weave.

===Post-Sundering===
[[File:Lolth MTG detail.jpg|thumb|''Lolth in the process of getting very handsy.''|385x385px]]
After the event known as the [[Second Sundering]], Lolth was no longer unrivaled as the goddess of the drow (even if she still retained her position of dominance), for the dead members of the Dark Seldarine were revived.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum

}} A further disadvantage for the Spider Queen, Eilistraee and Vhaeraun reached a truce and even reciprocal friendship after their return, which allowed them to focus their forces towards their main goal, rather than squandering resources in battling each other (although their followers still skirmished often).{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum

}} Moreover, Zinzerena managed to re-emerge and escape Lolth's grasp, depriving Lolth of the portfolio of assassination. Lolth also lost the portfolio of chaos (that she had stolen from Zinzerena about a century earlier): it went to [[Malyk (demipower)|Malyk]], drow god of rebellion and wild magic.

The wizard [[Mordenkainen]] claimed that, after the Second Sundering, [[Vhaeraun]] had dramatically steered away from his previous stance of rebellion against Lolth's system, and instead assumed a position of subservience to the Spider Queen, even coming to embody the ideal of drow male according to the Lolthite matriarchy: "swift, silent, obedient". According to Mordenkainen, Vhaeraun's faith became tolerable in Lolth-controlled cities, and was often practiced by males who wished for a better lot in life, but that weren't willing to openly oppose Lolth's matriarchy, rather than by drow who strove to demolish the system at its root.
