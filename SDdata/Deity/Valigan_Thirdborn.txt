'''Valigan Thirdborn''' was a lesser [[deity]] of anarchy in ancient [[Jhaamdath]], whose rise to power in the {{YearlinkName|-269}} directly coincided with that of Exarch [[Thelasand IV]], a bloodthirsty advisor who urged the emperor of Jhaamdath into greater conflict with the neighboring [[elves]]. After those same elves brought about Jhaamdath's fall shortly after, the region fell into lawlessness. It was pacified and Valigan was killed during the [[Procession of Justice]] ({{Yearlink|-247}} to {{Yearlink|-238}}).
