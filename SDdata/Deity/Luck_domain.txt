The '''Luck domain''' was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and other powers related to luck.

==Powers==
A priest with the Luck domain received good fortune once a day, potentially altering the outcome of a risky action they'd made.

==Spells==
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could use ''[[entropic shield]]'' to protect against projectile attacks; ''[[aid]]'' to fight better, gain vigor, and withstand fear; and ''[[protection from elements]]'' to resist energies. Furthermore, they could use ''[[freedom of movement]]'' to travel freely whatever the obstacles, ''[[break enchantment]]'' to rid a creature from various magical effects, ''[[mislead]]'' to turn invisible and create an illusory decoy, and ''[[spell turning]]'' to reflect other spells back to their casters. Ultimately, with ''[[moment of prescience]]'' they could gain great insight into an action, even ask their [[deity]] to intercede on their behalf with a ''[[miracle]]''.
