Lolth also lost the portfolio of chaos (that she had stolen from Zinzerena about a century earlier): it went to [[Malyk (demipower)|Malyk]], drow god of rebellion and wild magic.\n\nThe wizard [[Mordenkainen]] claimed that, after the Second Sundering, [[Vhaeraun]] had dramatically steered away from his previous stance of rebellion against Lolth's system, and instead assumed a position of subservience to the Spider Queen, even coming to embody the ideal of drow male according to the Lolthite matriarchy: \"swift, silent, obedient\". According to Mordenkainen, Vhaeraun's faith became tolerable in Lolth-controlled cities, and was often practiced by males who wished for a better lot in life, but that weren't willing to openly oppose Lolth's matriarchy, rather than by drow who strove to demolish the system at its root.",

The form most commonly found in the Abyss however, thought to be her true form, was a combination of the others, a giant spider with the head of a coldly beautiful female drow.",
        "Personality": "Lolth was a goddess of cold cruelty not out of place in the darkest depths of the endless Abyss, and toying with everyone from her minions to her victims.{{Cite dragon/408/History Check: Corellon and Gruumsh|7}}\n\nLolth demanded absolute fealty and obedience from all drow,\n\nDespite her demands for loyalty, those who blindly obeyed Lolth's demands would find themselves quickly led to their deaths. In truth, Lolth's capricious nature meant that there were few hard-and-fast rules, and much uncertainty as to her desires. The successful had to pay attention to her ever-changing wants, for her favor was fickle, The Spider Queen was technically capable of displays of kindness and aiding those she fancied, and would always give one chance for the disfavored to redeem themselves, but this usually meant a dangerous mission and in others might just mean silently watching their next move. She could never be relied on and her ultimate motivation was almost always manipulative.\n\nLolth's promotion of infighting amongst her worshipers led many to believe she was insane, and this assessment was not baseless. Indeed, ever since her fall from grace her sanity had frayed and fractured until she became the petty, conniving monster she was commonly known as. Her will was not merely fluid, but often times contradictory, Ironically, for all her demands for obedience, nothing demanded her attention and admiration more than treachery, even towards herself (if only temporarily). Guile and political ruthlessness were the signs of her favorite servants, and she ultimately admired ambition more than she did loyalty.",

        "History": {
            "Dawn Age": "Before her fall, Lolth was known as Araushnee, the lesser elven [[goddess]] of destiny and artisans. She was consort to Corellon, leader of all the elf deities, Unflinching as the fallen night, she too had played a part in the creation of the earliest elves; her cutting jests brought forth tears of laughter from Corellon from which mortal fey were spawned, as did Sehanine's arcing acrobatics. Sometimes the laughter between the three was dark and mocking, but more often, it was true and heartfelt.\n\nAraushnee would become the main goddess of the dark elves, whose nightly complexion matched her own, as well as a third child, [[Vandria Gilmadrith]].<ref>",
            "Aftermath": "After her exile, Araushnee took the name \"Lolth\". She conquered the 66th layer of the [[Abyss]], the [[Demonweb Pits]], for herself. \n\nAfter securing control over her layer, she plotted to exact vengeance against Corellon. Being unable to directly strike at him, she planned to be worshiped as a goddess by the elves, bringing misery to them and therefore to their \"father\". When the [[moon elf]] [[Kethryllia Amarillis]] came to retrieve her lover in the [[Abyss]] during a battle for the city of [[Sharlarion]], Lolth became interested in the world the elf came from, [[Toril]]. She sensed the presence of [[Vhaeraun]], at that time the major [[deity]] in [[Ilythiir]], and her attention was drawn there. Her fascination grew as she witnessed the Ilythiiri, at the time under [[Ka'Narlist]], preparing for war when Kethryllia had unknowingly revealed their position to them. Lolth admired the old mage's craftiness and he became her first worshiper and consort.\n\nIlythiir, the southern empire, was much to her liking, as it was richer and more cosmopolitan, but mainly because of the fierceness of its people, of their ambitions, and of their ability to act on those.",
            "First Flowering": "[[File:Lolth_p82.jpg|300px|thumb|Queen of the Demonweb Pits.]]\nOriginally, [[Ilythiir]] and the other elven nations were not on openly hostile footing, but Lolth poisoned this relationship by causing wars and strife. This led the elves to decide to create a dark elf-free piece of land. They caused the First Sundering, which split a region of the [[Faerûn|continent]] from the mainland in order to create an island out of it, a process which caused countless victims, a large part of the [[church of Vhaeraun]] among them. Vhaeraun's efforts to remedy this were undermined by the ongoing conflict between him and Eilistraee, granting Lolth and Ghaunadaur the opportunity to fill the void. The Spider Queen then started her machinations that would eventually lead to the Crown Wars.\n\nOne legend of the half-elven [[Crinti]] of the [[Shining South]] told a story of the Ilythiiri wizard whose name was lost to time. She was only known as the [[Spider Queen (wizard)|Spider Queen]]. According to the legend, the wizard stumbled across the veil and into the realm of the [[Unseelie Court]] where she learned their dark fey magics by unfortunate firsthand experiences. She was imprisoned and tormented but serendipitously escaped the fey realm. The Spider Queen was believed to have been driven insane by the fell magics but gained unimaginable power, becoming the most powerful spell-caster in Ilythiir. Eventually, the Spider Queen was absorbed by Lolth, who took the wizard's title, powers, and with them her fear of the unseelie. Lolth ended up passing that compulsory fear of the unseelie music onto her drow children and subsequently onto the Crinti half-elves. This lore was preserved within the tomes found in libraries of [[Halruaa]].",
            "Crown Wars": "For Lolth, the [[Crown Wars]] were an opportunity to gain control over the dark elves and at the same time exact vengeance against the Seldarine.\n\nLolth's church grew in prominence during the Second Crown War. At that time, [[Aryvandaar]], the [[sun elf]] nation, had started a military campaign against dark elves of [[Miyeritar]] (which would later culminate in the genocidal [[Dark Disaster]]). Both to avenge their Miyearitari cousins, and in fear that Aryvandaar could similarly lay waste on Ilythiir, the Ilythiiri joined the conflict against the elven empire. The Ilythiiri [[coronal]] summoned [[Wendonai]], a [[balor]] in service of Lolth, and bought power from it. Lolth swiftly acted, using this golden opportunity to get the dark elves under her control.\n\nOther noble families of Ilythiir followed their royalty's example, summoning further demonic allies sent by Vhaeraun, Kiaransalee and Ghaunadaur,\n\nAt that time, the Ilythiiri were still refining their worship. They knew that Lolth was a spider deity, and that the other five gods and goddesses, who would later become known as the [[Dark Seldarine]], (with the exception of [[Selvetarm]], who was not born yet) These efforts to put the drow deities in this relation in each other were considered so offensive by the depicted, that Lolth, Vhaeraun, Ghaundaur and Kiaransalee killed their high priests for it.\n\nDuring the Fourth Crown War, the elves' wish for divine salvation, the worship of Lolth who was starting to spread among the Ilythiiri, and the taint of Wendonai which had corrupted their leaders, caused the elves to gather at the Elven Court and summon the power of the Seldarine to curse the dark elves and turn them into [[drow]] (even innocent ones and the followers of Eilistraee, who had already been exterminated by the Aryvandaari). The combined forces of the remaining elven nations then violently chased the newly formed race underground.",
            "Era of Upheaval": "[[File:Lolth_symbol.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The symbol of Lolth, during the [[Era of Upheaval]].]]\nOnce in the [[Underdark]], the drow lived in a borderline animal state. With Eilistraee's power nearly collapsed due to the loss of so many of her people, and with Vhaeraun's, Kiaransalee's and Ghaunadaur's power being unable to compete with Lolth's, she became the main drow deity. She gathered them together and urged them into the foundation of their first city, [[Telantiwar]]. It later destroyed itself through infighting, causing the drow to spread throughout the Underdark.\n\nA thorn in her side was a [[demon lord]] called [[Zanassu]], who claimed dominion over spiders. Lolth got rid of him by using Selvetarm, her grandchild who was born from Vhaeraun and [[Zandilar]] when the Spider Queen's followers attacked the [[Yuirwood]]. Lolth convinced Selvetarm that killing the demon would have made Eilistraee, whom had befriended him, and whom he had come to admire, so he fought and defeated Zanassu, but ended up absorbing his power and being bound to Lolth's will in the process. Lolth thus solved two problems: one of her rivals was gone, and her daughter was prevented from getting an ally.",
            "Time of Troubles": "During the [[Time of Troubles]], apart from appearing in [[Menzoberranzan]] and assuming the aspect of [[Moander]] to attract more surface elves, [[humans]], and [[half-elves]], Lolth spread information on [[Zinzerena]], a [[deity|goddess]] from another world. When she appeared on [[Toril]], Lolth killed her, gaining the portfolios of chaos and assassination, and learning how the distribution and absorption of divine energy worked under [[Ao]]'s new rules.\n[[File:Flame sword of lolth.jpg|thumb|''The fabled [[Flame Sword of Lolth]].''|299x299px]]\nIn [[1369 DR]], Lolth guided one of her High Priestesses, [[Azurna]] in search of the ''[[Flame Sword of Lolth]]'' to establishing a presence in [[Undermountain]]. The ''Flame Sword'' was a powerful artifact created by the Queen of Spiders during the [[War of the Seldarine]]. The sword held immense power and was able to cut through the Planes. Upon her defeat, the elven gods took the sword, and eventually, it was hidden within Undermountain by [[Halaster Blackcloak]]. In [[1370 DR]], Azurna successfully assembled the ''spider statue'' that blocked the vault of the sword, allowing Lolth to manifest her giant drider avatar and tried to reclaim the item. She was confronted by an adventurer agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]], and the avatar was defeated. In the subsequent release of divine energy, ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' disappeared, slipping from the goddess' grasp once again.",
            "War of the Spider Queen": "The War of the Spider Queen was a period during which Lolth transformed herself into a [[greater deity]], turned the [[Demonweb Pits]] into an independent plane.",
            "Post-Spellplague": "In the following century, Lolth enjoyed a position of supremacy among the drow. She did suffer opposition from the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], the [[skulker of Vhaeraun|skulkers of Vhaeraun]]—the term used to describe those members of the [[church of Vhaeraun]] who retained divine magic despite their [[Vhaeraun|god's]] death—and the followers of Ghaunadaur.{{Cite dragon/413/Character Themes: Fringes of Drow Society}} The latter group was however a dying force, at least among drow, for Lolth successfully extinguished the knowledge about that god.\n\nAt some point in the years leading up to [[1479 DR]], Lolth ordered her servants to begin collecting [[blueflame ghost|blue fire]] items and relics important to [[Mystra]] in order to use them to craft her own [[Demon Weave]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|2765}} Her ultimate goal was to become the new goddess of magic,{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|3549}} but she ended up failing with the return of Mystra.{{Cite digital book/Archmage/Kindle|4754-4757}} In truth, Lolth's plan was doomed to fail from its conception, because she lacked the competence and understanding to sustain a Weave. In fact, despite her efforts, Lolth wasn't actually creating her own Weave; she was merely leeching off the remaining strands of Mystra's, which acted as a barrier between [[Toril]] and another cataclysm: one of such an immensity that it could have wreaked havoc across the whole planet and its Underdark.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)/Demon Weave}} Lolth's incompetence left the Weave on the verge of total collapse, and forced some of the then active [[Chosen of Mystra]] to sustain Lolth's construct on her behalf, unbeknownst to her, until Mystra recovered and reclaimed the Weave.",
            "Post-Sundering": "[[File:Lolth MTG detail.jpg|thumb|''Lolth in the process of getting very handsy.''|385x385px]]\nAfter the event known as the [[Second Sundering]], Lolth was no longer unrivaled as the goddess of the drow (even if she still retained her position of dominance), for the dead members of the Dark Seldarine were revived.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 19841\n| postid     = 468322\n| whichpage  = 13\n| date       = 2015-04-17\n| accessdate = \n}} A further disadvantage for the Spider Queen, Eilistraee and Vhaeraun reached a truce and even reciprocal friendship after their return, which allowed them to focus their forces towards their main goal, rather than squandering resources in battling each other (although their followers still skirmished often).{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 19841\n| postid     = 476469\n| whichpage  = 21\n| date       = 2015-11-11\n| accessdate = \n}} Moreover, Zinzerena managed to re-emerge and escape Lolth's grasp, depriving Lolth of the portfolio of assassination.
