Maram of the Great Spear was an ancient primordial of the Elemental Chaos. It was also said to be one of the "Seven Lost Gods" and one of the elder evils.
In the , the Netherese haphazardly summoned Maram and other primordials to serve as participants in the Seven Sigils War, but Maram escaped after the conflict ended. 
For fourteen years it terrorized the peoples of north Faerun, until in the , three mortals who one day would become known as the Dark Three led a large coalition against the primordial they succeeded in banishing it, but at a very heavy cost.
Thereafter, Maram was one of seven demipowers whod been defeated by or submitted to the god Bane, the Black Lord, in ancient times, among Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud Camnod the Unseen Haask, Voice of Hargut Tyranthraxus the Flamed One and two more whose names were lost to history. In Urgunds Description of Darkness, an account by Urgund of his imprisonment in the lower planes, these five entities were "those who fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane" and later sat in his Hall of Minor Courtiers as lesser powers.
In the , the Herald of Maram, the primordial Prince Pyricus managed to gain access to the Monument of the Ancients and began to weaken the dimensional barriers again. This attempt to reintroduce Maram back into Toril was foiled thanks to a heroic band of adventurers.
