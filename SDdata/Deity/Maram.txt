==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|-489}}, the [[Netherese]] haphazardly summoned Maram and other primordials to serve as participants in the [[Seven Sigils War]], but Maram escaped after the conflict ended.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48-49}} 

For fourteen years it terrorized the peoples of [[north Faerun]], until in the {{YearlinkName|-357}}, three mortals who one day would become known as the [[Dark Three]] led a large coalition against the primordial; they succeeded in banishing it, but at a very heavy cost.

Thereafter, Maram was one of seven [[demipower]]s who'd been defeated by or submitted to the god [[Bane]], the Black Lord, in ancient times, among [[Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud]]; [[Camnod the Unseen]]; [[Haask, Voice of Hargut]]; [[Tyranthraxus|Tyranthraxus the Flamed One]]; and two more whose names were lost to history. In ''[[Urgund's Description of Darkness]]'', an account by [[Urgund]] of his imprisonment in the [[lower planes]], these five entities were "those who fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane" and later sat in his Hall of Minor Courtiers as [[lesser power]]s.

In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, the Herald of Maram, the primordial Prince [[Pyricus]]{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|64}} managed to gain access to the [[Monument of the Ancients]] and began to weaken the dimensional barriers again. This attempt to reintroduce Maram back into Toril was foiled thanks to a heroic band of adventurers.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|47-82}}
