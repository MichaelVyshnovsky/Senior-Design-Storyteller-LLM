        "mainbody": "The Justice domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers pertaining to justice.\nAfter the Spellplague, a divine caster with the Justice domain would become more insightful. In addition, when they used certain offensive powers and hit a target enemy, all wounded allies nearby would attack more accurately. These powers were bond of censure (for avengers), mantle of the infidel (for invokers), righteous brand (for clerics), and virtuous strike (for paladins).\nAfter the Spellplague, the divine caster could channel divinity to use immediate justice, which was meant to enforce balance. They fired a flare of divine energy at an enemy who had brought an ally to the point of passing out or worse, lancing them with radiant energies."
