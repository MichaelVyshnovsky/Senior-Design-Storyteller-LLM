The Wrath domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to anger. One was based around righteous outrage, the other just rage.
Less-noble priests often had a quick temper, never forgot a slight, and exuded an air of righteousness that was often undeserved.
For the righteous, the priest gained the ability to immediately strike back at foes that struck them first.
For the others, the priest gained the ability to increase his or her strength as they flew into a rage for a short time. They could perform feats of tremendous strength or do great damage, but their wrath severely clouded their reason during that time.
For the righteous, novice spellcasters were able to use the doom, energize potion, and affliction spells. Clerics of some experience could cast radiant shield, righteous might, and vengeance halo. Those that were masters of this domain had access to righteous smite, last judgment, and storm of vengeance.
For the others, novice spellcasters were able to use the rhinos rush, bulls strength, and rage spells. Clerics of some experience could cast shout, righteous might, and song of discord. Those that were masters of this domain had access to Tensers transformation, greater shout, and storm of vengeance.
