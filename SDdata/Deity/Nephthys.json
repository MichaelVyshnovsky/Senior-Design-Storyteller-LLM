The face of Nephthys might appear to forces hostile to her, and a golden mist might appear to ward off grave robbers. A single gold coin might lead to great treasure, and an individual who pleased the Guardian of Wealth and Commerce might experience a shower of such coins."
        },
        "Powers": "Nephthys could stun enemies with her mere presence, and kill with a simple gaze. She had the ability to raise the [[undead]] into her service, and could increase wealth with a touch of her hand.",
        "Relationships": "Nephthys was the daughter of [[Geb]] and [[Nut (deity)|Nut]]. She was the twin sister of Isis and was once married to Seth, who she left after his murder of Osiris.\n\nNephthys had few true allies. [[Waukeen]] closely monitored the growth of the church of the Devoted Lady.\n\nNephthys openly opposed [[Mask]] and the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Church of Nephthys": "[[File:Priest of Nephthys.jpg|right|thumb|A priestess of Nephthys]]\nThe clergy of the church of Nephthys was composed entirely of women of Mulan descent. These [[cleric|priestesses]] must be married or widowed.\n\nClerics of Nephythis administered the economy of [[Mulhorand]], as well as served in the funeral preparations of those in the upper classes.\n\nTemples dedicated to Nephthys were defensible structures designed to display great wealth. These buildings often served as banks for the Mulhorandi people. The center of the church of Nephthys was the [[Vault of Golden Commerce]], located in the city of [[Neldorild]].\n\nThe church of Nephthys had spread throughout Unther, and had even begun to push beyond this border.\n\nClerics of Nephthys usually wore white [[linen]] skirts and [[robe]]s or linen dresses. They wore wigs on their shaved heads as well as [[sandal]]s. Three blue circles were painted on a priestess' forehead, a mark of her divine calling.\n\nWhen preparing themselves for combat, the clergy of Nephthys selected the most expensive equipment they could afford.\n\nClerics of Nephthys prayed for spells at noon.",
            "Orders": "The clergy of Nephthys took up arms to protect the wealth of their nation.\n\nThe [[Order of the Golden Coin]] served as guardians for hire to the people of Mulhorand.",
            "Celebrations": "The clergy of Nephthys performed rituals over the deceased in preparation for burial.\n\nOn the [[Feast of the Silver Coin]] (known as the [[Feast of the Moon]] throughout the rest of [[Faer√ªn]]), Nephthys was thanked for the wealth accumulated over the past year.\n\nDuring [[Passage Onward]], protective wards, spells, and [[trap]]s were set to protect the tombs of the recently deceased."
        },
        "History": "[[File:Resurrection of Osiris.jpg|thumb|left|Nephthys and Isis at the resurrection of Osiris.]]\nNephthys assisted [[Isis]] in resurrecting [[Osiris]], who had been murdered by [[Set]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]], Nephthys and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of [[demigod]]s and led the [[Mulhorand]]i uprising against the [[Imaskari]], in a manner similar to how the [[Chosen]] manifested in other regions. As of [[1489 DR]], Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people."
