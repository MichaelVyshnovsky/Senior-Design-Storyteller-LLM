        "mainbody": "Nephthys, (Pronounce|NEF|thiss|refs=\nNephthys typically appeared as a Mulan woman in royal dress. She often wore numerous pieces of gold jewelry as well.\nNephthys will was sometimes communicated through golems or hoarding animals, such as rats. The face of Nephthys might appear to forces hostile to her, and a golden mist might appear to ward off grave robbers. A single gold coin might lead to great treasure, and an individual who pleased the Guardian of Wealth and Commerce might experience a shower of such coins.\nNephthys could stun enemies with her mere presence, and kill with a simple gaze. She had the ability to raise the undead into her service, and could increase wealth with a touch of her hand.\nNephthys was the daughter of Geb and Nut. She was the twin sister of Isis and was once married to Seth, who she left after his murder of Osiris.\nNephthys had few true allies. Waukeen closely monitored the growth of the church of the Devoted Lady.\nNephthys openly opposed Mask and the Red Wizards of Thay.\nleft|thumb|Holy Symbol of Nephthys\nNephthys urged her followers to accumulate wealth, but had little patience for true greed. Worship of the Devoted Lady was most common among nobles and housewives.\nright|thumb|A priestess of Nephthys\nThe clergy of the church of Nephthys was composed entirely of women of Mulan descent. These priestesses must be married or widowed.\nClerics of Nephythis administered the economy of Mulhorand, as well as served in the funeral preparations of those in the upper classes.\nTemples dedicated to Nephthys were defensible structures designed to display great wealth. These buildings often served as banks for the Mulhorandi people. The center of the church of Nephthys was the Vault of Golden Commerce, located in the city of Neldorild.\nThe church of Nephthys had spread throughout Unther, and had even begun to push beyond this border.\nClerics of Nephthys usually wore white linen skirts and robes or linen dresses. They wore wigs on their shaved heads as well as sandals. Three blue circles were painted on a priestess forehead, a mark of her divine calling.\nWhen preparing themselves for combat, the clergy of Nephthys selected the most expensive equipment they could afford.\nClerics of Nephthys prayed for spells at noon.\nThe clergy of Nephthys took up arms to protect the wealth of their nation.\nThe Order of the Golden Coin served as guardians for hire to the people of Mulhorand.\nThe clergy of Nephthys performed rituals over the deceased in preparation for burial.\nOn the Feast of the Silver Coin (known as the Feast of the Moon throughout the rest of Faer√ªn), Nephthys was thanked for the wealth accumulated over the past year.\nDuring Passage Onward, protective wards, spells, and traps were set to protect the tombs of the recently deceased.\nthumb|left|Nephthys and Isis at the resurrection of Osiris.\nNephthys assisted Isis in resurrecting Osiris, who had been murdered by Set.\nDuring the Second Sundering, Nephthys and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of demigods and led the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari, in a manner similar to how the Chosen manifested in other regions. As of 1489 DR, Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people."
