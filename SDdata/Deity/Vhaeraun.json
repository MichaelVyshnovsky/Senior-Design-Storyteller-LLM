More to read here: http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=19841&whichpage=21#476469\n\nThe wizard [[Mordenkainen]] claimed that, after the Second Sundering, Vhaeraun had dramatically steered away from his previous stance of rebellion against Lolth's system, and instead assumed a position of subservience to the Spider Queen, even coming to embody the ideal of drow male according to the Lolthite matriarchy: \"swift, silent, obedient\". According to Mordenkainen, Vhaeraun's faith even became tolerable in Lolth-controlled cities.",
        "Description": "As an avatar, Vhaeraun appeared as a normal male drow, and appeared either with a height of 16 feet (4.9 meters) His body was surrounded by shadow that did not just randomly lighten and darken but his body seemingly disappeared when this shadow went over him. By allowing it to swallow him completely, Vhaeraun could conduct a rapid form of teleportation.{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|204-210}}\n\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 250px\n| source = [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] to [[Leliana Vrinn]] \n| text   = <nowiki>[He]</nowiki> looks just like a regular drow, except for his eyes. They change color, you see, to reflect his moods. Red when the god is angry, blue when he's pleased, green when… he's puzzled….\n}}\nIt was thought that he never used armor,) mask and a long cloak of the same hue. His eyes and/or hair could change color to reflect his emotions (red for anger, gold for triumph, blue for amusement, green for puzzlement and curiosity).{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|187-192}}\n\nWhen he appeared to [[Inthracis]] in [[1373 DR]], he was missing a hand, though at a later time, he was reported to be holding two weapons, one in each hand.\n\nA legend told among drow, to crush the idea of rebellion against the matriarchy, was that Vhaeraun wore his mask to hide scars inflicted by Lolth for his arrogance. A similar legend was one that told Vhaeraun to be mute because he lost his tongue to Lolth for questioning her. The Masked Lord was seen talking with his mouth though the veracity of the latter legend was unknown.{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|187-229}}",
        "Personality": "Vhaeraun was an arrogant (at times vain) god and shared the vindictive trait of all [[drow]] [[Dark Seldarine|deities]]. His arrogance made him believe the drow to be above other races. He also urged every single drow to believe she or he was above other drow. His followers derived the idea of gender equality from this belief of his. He believed that all other races should be subjugated by the drow.\n\nWhile he was willing to use underhandedness to reach his goals, he didn't tolerate the same being used against him or his people.\n\nDespite these harsh traits, he was also willing to cooperate when it came to undermining and fighting his mother, [[Lolth]], and tried to unite the other [[Dark Seldarine|drow gods]] against her.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 250px\n| source = Vhaeraun to [[Inthracis]], in response to being asked, \"And for me, Masked Lord?\"\n| text   =  For you? …For you this: my gratitude, something that is beyond price.\n}}\nVhaeraun was actively involved in the lives of his followers. Vhaeraun was indeed one who didn't distance himself from the concerns of his followers and answered their pleas about fifteen percent of the time, and the means to avert self-sacrifice to those working for him.\n\nHe and his followers shared a realistic understanding regarding his strength. He knew that he was too weak to fight his mother directly, so he worked against her in secretive ways, starting with passive resistance by teaching ideas that contradicted Lolth's dogma\n\nLike [[Kiaransalee]], [[Lolth]], and [[Zinzerena]], Vhaeraun was prayed to on practically every world inhabited by drow&mdash;for example, on [[Oerth]]&mdash;and had a unique aspect for each world. These aspects were usually different from each other in slight ways, but the one from [[Toril]] drastically differed from the other aspects. To be precise, the other aspects were all of a [[neutral evil]] god, while the aspect from Toril was [[chaotic evil]].",
        "Powers": "{{Main|Lesser deity}}Vhaeraun was a [[lesser deity]]. He granted spells to his divine spellcasters and gave his clerics access to the abilities and spells of the [[Chaos domain|Chaos]], [[Drow domain|Drow]], [[Evil domain|Evil]], [[Travel domain|Travel]], and [[Trickery domain|Trickery]] [[domain]]s and could inherently cast the spells from these domains. After the [[Second Sundering]], he granted the new Trickery and [[War domain]] to his clerics.\n\nHe could look into people's minds. He combined his sensing abilities to be constantly on the look out for dissidents, rebels, and generally dissatisfied people with the potential to work for him against the Spider Queen in Lolth-ruled cities where he had already at least some worshipers working against his mother, like [[Menzoberranzan]], [[Tlethtyrr]], or [[Waerglarn]]. Once someone was deemed compatible, the individual was approached by a manifestation of Vhaeraun or sent clerics of his to have a one-on-one inducement interview. (See [[#Manifestations|Manifestations]].)\n\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 250px\n| source = Vhaeraun to [[Malvag]] when asked, \"Why won't you help me?\"\n| text   = You lack the skill.\n}}\nVhaeraun could speak and read any language, including nonverbal languages, but seemed to have a preference for [[Drow language|High Drow]]. He could transfer information directly into the brains of people with whom he was conversing. This method ensured that the information was transferred without risk of misunderstandings but was very painful for the recipient.\n\nVhaeraun could levitate. Out of all his movement abilities, teleportation seemed to come most naturally to him. He was seen casually teleporting around walking distance during his business negotiation with [[Inthracis]]. For all these movement abilities, he had his limits. For example, he couldn't ignore Lolth's ban on entering her domain during the [[Silence of Lolth]] and needed outside help to do so.\n\nVhaeraun had the ability to turn his body parts incorporeal and touch corporeal things inside a corporeal container while remaining incorporeal. For example, he could grab inside a body and crush its internal organs. It is not clear whether it was his ability to cast ''polymorph any object'', but he once changed a cage with [[Sehanine Moonbow]] inside into portable size and dumped her through a ''gate'' that he created.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 250px\n| source = Vhaeraun, talking to [[Shakti Hunzrin]] by telepathy\n| text   = These spells are but the first of my gifts. With them you can swear to Lolth&hellip; yet maintain first loyalty to me.\n}}\nApart from always moving as though under ''[[pass without trace]]'', and turning invisible was a part of his fighting style. What made his abilities at stealth truly special though wasn't the abilities themselves but his skills at them. An entire percent of his clergy in his [[church of Vhaeraun|church]] consisted of clerical double spies, called [[masked traitor]]s, clerics whom Lolth believed were under her employment but were in truth [[specialty priest]]s of her son. This was possible because of his aforementioned skill. Lolth, who was more powerful than him, simply couldn't compete with him on the field of stealth and trickery.\n\nVhaeraun could change his and his equipment's size It was impossible to hit him with mundane weapons. the [[drow]] demigod of battle prowess, and was driven away, effectively losing against his own son.\n\nVhaeraun possessed all the immunities and protections of a lesser deity. In addition, Vhaeraun was immune to all kind of [[illusion]]s&mdash;except those created by more powerful divine beings&mdash;and to being charmed. when it came to his immunity against charms, he was under no such restrictions.\n\nVhaeraun was thought to be unable to cast spells by himself;{{Cite digital book/Resurrection/Kindle|192-200}} He was able to duplicate any divine or arcane spell used by his followers within 180 feet (55 meters) and could cast them while fighting physically at the same time. He was capable of generating heat, both in the form of magma and by converting blasts of shadowstuff into fire, the latter being hot enough to cause agony to deities. He could also cause a ''[[bladebend]]'' effect once every six minutes.",
        "Possessions": "Normally, deities didn't use magic items, but Vhaeraun could and did wield any magic item provided by his followers, as long as they could be used by evil individuals, (See [[#Manifestations|Manifestations]].)\n\nIn battle, he wielded two swords, ''[[Nightshadow]]'' and ''[[Shadowflash]]''. The former was a black ''[[longsword of quickness]]'', which he could make appear out of nowhere in his hands and that was invisible while in darkness.\n\nShadowflash was a [[short sword]] made of silver, which could emit a flash of eerie light, capable of blinding those who looked at it.\n\nThe Masked Lord's cloak was able to absorb seven spells of any strength each day, including magic that could affect a whole area, (therefore protecting both the deity and those who stood near him,) and could make the wearer transparent to those who looked through it. If stolen, or when the avatar of its owner was destroyed, the cloak would melt into nothing.",
        "Divine Realm": "''Main article: [[Ellaniath]]''\n\nVhaeraun’s home realm was called [[Ellaniath]], the whereabouts of which were unknown as the Masked Lord wiped the memories of any visitor.",
        "Manifestations": {
            "Calling": ";Avatar\nVhaeraun was capable of creating avatars and preferred to appear in his avatar form when possible. (See [[#Description|Description]].) A ritual needed to be completed for such an event,\n\nThe ritual consisted of the casting of a ''[[gate]]'' spell and could be done reliably and without the need to offer a magic item when the Masked Lord's personal goals were involved, if the calling of an avatar as done by [[Tzirik Jaelre]] was taken as a standard.\n\n;Servitors\nIt was relatively easy to convince Vhaeraun to send one of his servitors for help, provided the proper rituals were conducted in situations of real need.",
            "Tangible Effects": "Apart from direct help, Vhaeraun had other means by which he could provide his followers with tangible help.\n\n;Flitting Black Shadow\nWhen Vhaeraun wanted to directly help an individual who hadn't conducted the ritual to call his avatar, he could send a flitting black shadow. It acted as a half-mask for a chosen individual for about nine minutes.\n\nDuring that time, the recipient received a blessing in the form of minor healing, the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell, ability to wound creatures immune to mundane weapons, moving silently while under the ''[[pass without trace]]'' spell, and success at keeping one's footing under all circumstances. A single creature could only be blessed like this once per day.\n\n;Half-mask of Shadow\nAnother manifestation consisted of a floating insubstantial half-mask, made of shadow. It could pass through ''any'' obstacle, magical or not and including divine boundaries, to reach the enemy of his people. The mask then (twice per appearance) laughed mockingly and chillingly, inducing terror in those who heard it, as though with the ''[[fear]]'' spell.\n\n;Interview\nVhaeraun could see into other people's minds, he used this ability to discern compatibility with his philosophy. Once a person with the proper mindset was found, a shadowy black face mask appeared before the individual. Via telepathy, a one-on-one inducement talk was conducted. If such a private meeting was discovered, the mask used a number spells to kill the intruders. After proving that his cause was based on power and had chances to succeed, the mask left to come back later for another talk.",
            "Information": "Vhaeraun could, apart from the standard manifestations (see infobox), convey information by sharing concrete information with several people at once through shared dreams.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|2}}"
        },
        "Activities": "Vhaeraun's goal was to put the [[Ilythiir]]i, or [[drow]], back into the position of power that they once held. He detested seeing his people wither because of the pointless infighting and division that Lolth promoted. His plan towards his goal was to undo the Spider Queen and her idea of \"society\", replacing it with one where the drow would be united and both genders treated with equality. He saw that as the only way to lead the drow to reclaim their power and place on the surface, called the Night Above, to rule over all the others. [[Elves]] represented an exception, as it was Vhaeraun's belief that all the [[elf|Tel'Quessir]] needed to work together for common progress.\n[[File:Vhaeraun 2e.PNG|thumb|250px|right|''Vhaeraun spying on his enemies.'']]\nThe Masked Lord taught subtle opposition against the priestesses of Lolth and their ideals. He incited his followers to rebel and sow rebellion&mdash;especially among male drow&mdash;against the Spider Queen's matriarchy, by any means available, going as far as to personally teach methods and skills of resistance.\n\nAccording to the [[Mordenkainen]], however, after the Second Sundering, Vhaeraun changed his stance, and his faith became mostly practiced by males who wished for a better lot in life, but that weren't willing to rebel against Lolth's matriarchy.\n\nOn the surface, Vhaeraun taught his followers to increase drow power and influence based on real assets, by trade and association with other creatures, but also by criminal means,&mdash;that the two deities were confused with each other among non-drow there.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 19841\n| postid     = 476688\n| whichpage  = 22\n| date       = 2015-11-14\n| accessdate = \n}}\n\nThe Shadow also gathered any particularly effective poisons, spells, and tactics devised by his clerics, in order to share such tools with the rest, and also trained the otherwise defenseless male drow in the skills of a [[rogue]].",

He vowed to kill Vhaeraun if he ever tried to hurt his sister.\n\nInterestingly, the one type of magic that the Protector considered too corrupt for elves and thus suitable for [[drow]], the usage of the [[Shadow Weave]], was the niche Vhaeraun filled in his role as the patron of [[shadow magic]].\n\n;Sehanine Moonbow\nVhaeraun hated [[Sehanine Moonbow]] for escaping his prison during the [[War of the Seldarine]].\n\n;Shevarash\n[[Shevarash]] dedicated his life to killing drow.

(See below.)\n\n;Lolth\nVhaeraun and Lolth's relationship started as mother and son.

Lolth promoted favoritism towards females; Vhaeraun promoted gender equality. the Masked Lord urged his followers to cooperate with surface elves.

If [[Ka'Narlist]] was taken as a measure, followers of Ghaunadaur considered Vhaeraun an upstart who was not attractive to those who were looking for life force as a power source. There was also an overlap in their follower base. A meaningful part of Ghaunadaur's followers were philosophically closer to Vhaeraun than Ghaunadaur and followed the latter only because they didn't know about the god of thievery or his agenda.{{cite web\n| url            = http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=fr/pg20021127x\n| title          = Dark Elf Portals\n| accessdate     = 2016-12-29\n| author         = Ramon Arjona\n| date           = 2002-11-06\n| work           = \n| publisher      = Wizards of the Coast\n| pages = \n}}\nFollowers of Ghaunadaur and Vhaeraun seemed to work together based on individual projects.

At some point in time, though, the two managed to set aside their differences enough for radical Selvetargtlin and Vhaeraunites to cooperate, such that being raised by Selvetargtlin was not something to bat an eye at.\n\nIt was heavily suspected that the reason why the attack on the Promenade of the Dark Maiden and Vhaeraun's assassination attempt on the Dark Maiden were on the same day was because the two gods were in league with each other.",
            "Enemies": ";Underdark Deities\nA large number of [[Underdark]] deities were also his enemies.

Still, the Lady of Poison and the Masked Lord maintained a functional working relationship.",
            "Followers": "Generally speaking, the evil drow deities had a strange relationship with their followers. In some cases, followers were referred to in terms of belonging to one or the other deity like possessions.. That seemed to be meant in the literal sense for Lolth and Kiaransalee, who were capable of using their followers' fate as a wager in their game for their own gain.While [[Eilistraee]] took part in those events, she didn't do so for personal gain but with the purpose of freeing the drow from Lolth's poison once and for all, endangering herself for that goal (''[[Sacrifice of the Widow]]'', p. 3). The Dark Maiden didn't see her followers as possessions; she strove to never forcefully intervene in their lives and to instead help them find their own path (''[[Demihuman Deities]]'', p. 12). While Vhaeraun meddled in this game, he didn't wager his followers like the others.\n\nThe drow gods also had dogmas that were generally concerned with describing how to live a life that pleased them, whereas Vhaeraun's dogma was unique in that it was used to outline the goal of his organization and the steps towards it. He considered himself the leader of this endeavor.\n\nThe relationship between him and his followers was based on a deal&mdash;the followers' obedience in exchange for divine support,{{cite web\n| url            = http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rp/20030101a\n| title          = Alak Abaeir, Drow Assassin\n| accessdate     = 2016-07-17\n| author         = Ramon Arjona\n| date           = 2002-01-01\n| work           = Realms Personalities\n| publisher      = Wizards of the Coast\n}} to completely personal reasons like the desire for revenge, simple madness, or because they thought that Vhaeraun's support was a tool strong enough for the follower's social advancement to justify the risk of exposure.\n\nVhaeraun primarily valued his followers for their action; what was excluded from evaluation were their intentions, private desires, and thoughts, including rebellious ones. He was capable of punishing his followers for bad performance&mdash;a good track record wasn't considered an excuse for it. He also punished for transgressions, such as impersonating him, even with punishments that virtually meant death, as happened to [[Tellik Melarn]]. He held people in high standing for their actions, despite any rebellious thoughts against him.",
            "Mortals": "His goal was to lead the drow back to their former position of power. He saw a general need for advancement for elves and encouraged cooperation, including intermarriage among the elven races. The goal included the subjugation of other races. Intermarrying also had an ulterior motive in the form of increasing drow numbers on the surface by taking advantage of the drow's genetic dominance and the psychological quirk of children to favor their drow parent. Despite this, cooperation with other races was possible. He had an unexplained dislike against [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s and forbade his followers from associating with these races, but they did so anyway.

Vhaeraun was the one who hid Corellon's sheath, so that Eilistraee would find it, The sheath was cursed to direct her arrows to the bearer, Corellon, and retrieving it and giving it back to him guaranteed that she would be in his vicinity when the battle ensued. Vhaeraun's other role was to imprison Sehanine Moonbow. She needed to be imprisoned because his mother Lolth conducted the very first step of the betrayal in plain sight of the moon goddess, thus revealing it to her. The moon goddess eventually managed to escape her prison, albeit at high cost to herself. During the war, Vhaeraun protected Araushnee.

Among them, Vhaeraun became the mainstream deity. in the first elven state [[Ilythiir]].\n\nHe, and to a lesser degree Ghaunadaur, helped their people to carefully but successfully expand their territory throughout southern [[Faerûn]] and power, to a level that kept them independent from the dragons.

Seldarine-following elves came up with the idea to create a dark elf-free piece of land for those weary of the difficulties on the continent. They used [[elven high magic]], and while they succeeded at creating their island, [[Evermeet]], they damaged the [[Faerun|continent]], with accompanying casualties, among them many citizens of Ilythiir, as collateral damage. Lolth then became the hegemonic deity in Ilythiir, allowing her to start her machinations to corrupt and destroy all elves, which culminated in the [[Crown Wars]].",

[[Geirildin Sethomiir]], the ''[[coronal]]'' of Ilythiir, read even earlier those intentions in the actions of Aryvandaar. The coming battles were viewed and treated as battles for survival, so he made a pact with Lolth by proxy of [[Wendonai]], around {{Yearlink|-11500}}, to gain the power needed to save his people. This act made Lolth the most important deity in Ilythiir.\n\nNobles of Ilythiir followed the example of their ''coronal'' and made their own pacts, and Vhaeraun, no longer the main deity, supported the dark elves of Ilythiir with servants and other support during the battles, alongside Ghaunadaur and Kiaransalee.\n\nIt is not very clear what kind of role Vhaeraun filled during the Crown Wars, though it was known that it was not one as a warmonger; that role fell to Lolth and Ghaunadaur.\n\nThe Ilythiiri, who were still refining their worship of the Dark Seldarine, used to portray their gods as spider deities, and high priests were killed by the offended gods for promoting this kind of iconography. Vhaeraun, for example, was depicted as a Masked Spider.\n\nThe Crown Wars destroyed most elven realms, including Ilythiir. By the end of this era, Vhaeraun and Lolth were enemies. (See [[#Dark Seldarine|Relationships]].)\n\nVhaeraun and Eilistraee joined Lolth in forming the new drow pantheon.

            "War of the Spider Queen": "{{See also|War of the Spider Queen}}\n;Silence of Lolth\nIn the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the goddess Lolth went into a state of hibernation, a period called the [[Silence of Lolth]], with Selvetarm protecting her, as part of a plan to increase her power and separate her divine realm, the [[Demonweb Pits]], from the [[Abyss]]. Vhaeraun gained influence through unfurling his plans during this opportunity. His followers took over power by both legal{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Campaigns|9-10}} and violent means,\n[[File:Vhaeraun and Selvetarm Do Battle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Vhaeraun and his son, [[Selvetarm]], dueling.'']]\nIn that same year, the drow of Menzoberranzan, through [[Triel Baenre]], sent a group of powerful adventurers, led by [[Quenthel Baenre]], to discover the cause of Lolth's silence (or, as was then suspected, disfavor). During [[Uktar]], Quenthel's company finally managed to gain the collaboration of a cleric of Vhaeraun, After Vhaeraun grievously wounded her, Selvetarm appeared to battle Vhaeraun, but both fell off the web and plummeted into the darkness below. This battle caused significant damage to the fabric of the multiverse. Among other things, it caused a part of the Nine Hells to seep into Toril. Tzirik tried to create another ''gate'' but, luckily for Lolth, failed because [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] managed to cast a ''[[sending]]'' spell across the planes&mdash;something that didn't always work&mdash;and managed to order [[Jeggred Baenre]] to kill the Vhaeraunite priest.\n\nAnother attempt at Lolth's life was made through a bargain Vhaeraun made with the [[yugoloth]] [[Inthracis]]. He couldn't act personally because of Lolth's ban against divine creatures entering her realm. The bargain consisted of the yugoloth and his army killing the potential candidates for the position of Lolth's [[Chosen]], the vital component for her successful rebirth. In exchange, Vhaeraun was to assassinate Inthracis' superior, [[Kexxon]], the [[Oinoloth]], thus enabling the yugoloth's promotion, as payment on confirmation of success. The attempt, however, failed.\n\n;After the Silence\nAfter the Silence of Lolth, Eilistraee and Lolth started a divine game of [[sava]] over the destiny of the drow, Vhaeraun meddled with this game, though without wagering his life and those of his followers. Nevertheless, he and his followers did plot another attempt against Lolth's life to end her reign. The idea was to open a gate between Ellaniath, Vhaeraun’s realm, and Eilistraee's portion of [[Arvandor]], using elven high magic, so that the god could pass through and assassinate his sister. Then, the surface drow would be united under a single banner, increasing the number of Vhaeraun's followers and giving him the necessary power boost to kill his mother.\n\nHowever, such magic was very taxing and would have required the sacrifice of the souls of the casters. Because of this, the followers of the Masked Lord started to kill various priestesses of Eilistraee and collect their souls in their masks, using a spell called ''[[soultheft]]'', to use the souls as a fuel for the ritual.\n\nOn [[Nightal 20]] of the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]], Vhaeraun managed to enter his sister Eilistraee's realm and attempted to assassinate her. The plan failed because of the machinations of Lolth, as conducted by [[Halisstra Melarn]]. She captured [[Malvag]], the organizer of the undertaking and led [[Cavatina Xarann]] to him so he'd be killed and the soul in the mask freed by her. Halisstra then raised Malvag, so he could continue his undertaking. The [[church of Eilistraee]] had a program to revive every dead priestess because they were otherwise too small in number. Thus, the priestess whose soul was captured was revived; she conveyed her information, and The Dark Maiden was warned by [[Qilue Veladorn]]. With the warning, his secure success chance as an assassin was forfeit, and he lost the fight. No mortal actually witnessed the battle that ensued, so what happened remains largely unknown. However, Eilistraee emerged from the battle alive, suggesting that Vhaeraun had failed and perished at the hand of his sister. Eilistraee was changed after the event; she now held both her brother's and her own portfolios, and gained the title of \"Masked Lady\".<ref group=\"note\">''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' explicitly says that Vhaeraun's assassination attempt failed and Eilistraee killed him. However, [[Ed Greenwood]] [http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=19841&whichpage=22#476639 suggests] that Eilistraee didn't actually kill her brother. The Dark Maiden defeated Vhaeraun with the indirect help of her ally [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], as the [[Weave]] frustrated the Masked Lord's magic while enhancing Eilistraee's. The goddess temporarily took her brother's portfolio, and trapped his sentience in the Weave, where it was enfolded in a dream by Mystra. The Lady of Mysteries did this to ensure that the two drow siblings would survive the cataclysm that she knew was coming&mdash;the [[Spellplague]]&mdash;in which she would be \"killed\" to renew the Weave and magic would go wild. After Mystra and the Weave were completely restored in [[1487 DR]], the goddess of magic could finally give Eilistraee her own lost power and do the same with Vhaeraun, after having awakened him from his dream.''\n\nThe influence that Vhaeraun's portfolios had on Eilistraee manifested through outward changes, like her starting to wear clothes that hid her features, but also through a change in morale in her church. Her Chosen began spreading lies for propaganda's sake; engaging in bribery or ordering assassinations to ensure the silence of those who knew the truth became acceptable to her. Eilistraee didn't have control over Vhaeraun's followers, and didn't seem to be fully capable of using his powers. To begin with, Vhaeraun's petitioners were capable of rejecting her. His former clerics, even those who had actively worked against Eilistraee, were still able to receive spells, though not their strongest ones. She also seemed unable to detect the betrayal of former clerics of Vhaeraun, whom she accepted as hers, when they joined forces with Ghaunadaur's to bring the doom of the Promenade of the Dark Maiden.\n\nSome of Vhaeraun's followers joined Eilistraee; others refused to have anything to do with Eilistraee and joined gods like Shar; still others stayed with their old faith and/or never became aware that their god died, later forming the [[Skulker of Vhaeraun|Skulkers of Vhaeraun]].{{Cite dragon/413/Character Themes: Fringes of Drow Society}}",

They were called Skulkers of Vhaeraun and mostly consisted of disgruntled drow males but also included a few females.
