        "mainbody": "ikanuti was a powerful entity that had a cordial relationship with Haku, a Zakharan deity known as the Master of the Desert Wind. Throughout the multiverse, she was the patron deity of the bhuka, a race of desert-dwelling goblinoids.The bhuka exist throughout different parts of the multiverse. Bhuka of the Realms (known to explore the Pyramid of Amun-Re of the Raurin desert) may worship Kikanuti, though this entity does not appear in any Realms material.\nBhuka came from the underground to the surface of their worlds in an event called The Emergence. Before this, they would dwell underground in caves referred to as the Womb of Kikanuti, where she nurtured them until they were mature and ready to emerge to the world above, regarded as Kikanutis Hearth.\nAfter the Emergence, some bhuka explored parts of the Raurin desert, particularly the Pyramid of Amun-Re.\nKikanuti was the sworn enemy of Maglubiyet, who she saw as a slaver of his followers, keeping them beneath the earth and blind to the joys of life. Maglubiyet coveted Kikanutis power over the fertility of the earth, and sought to take it for his own to expand his dominion.\nKikanuti had a cordial relationship with Haku, a Zakharan deity who embodied aspects of the migration that had scattered the bhuka across the wastes.\nKikanuti was principally worshiped by the bhuka, and she held desert life together for the goblinoid people. Bhuka villages were led by a Grandmother, a powerful druid who both oversaw the village council and served as the villages link to Kikanuti. These villages kept a relic of the Emergence, and when all of these relics were assembled properly, they formed a map to the Womb of Kikanuti, from which the bhuka emerged.\nBhuka villages contained ceremonial pits, dug into a courtyard or sacred cave and covered with a lid made of painted animal hides. These pits, with walls inscribed with traditional symbols depicting The Emergence, was where a number of solemn rituals were held to recall back to the dark world below from which their people emerged. Outsiders were forbidden to enter these sacred pits.\nBhuka throughout the multiverse believed Kikanuti guided them by sending her \"spirit children\" to dwell among them. These spirits were represented by special spirit masks donned by clan elders during special festival dances. The spirits then possessed the elders and were honored through the offering of feast and prayer.\nSpiritual leaders of the bhuka who had a close connection with Kikanuti were known as Lords of Tides. This connection to her power allowed these lords to better survive the harsh elements of the desert, as well as find water and resources for the clan.\nLords of Tides were the spiritual centers of their tribes, usually leading groups of shamans. They held responsibility for seasonal ceremonies, weather magics and the initiation of new members of the clan. Though important members of the clans, Lords of Tides still answered to the Grandmothers, who held final authority over the clans. Though usually of the bhuka people, an outsider may have been blessed and granted training to become a Lord of Tides, though this was a rare and singular honor in some places throughout the multiverse."
