'''Graz'zt''' was the [[demon lord|demon prince]] of pleasure, decadence, and unlimited self-indulgence, as well as the patron of corrupt authorities and tyrants who would rule by force. He ruled the 45{{th}}, 46{{th}}, and 47{{th}} layers of the [[Abyss]], known as [[Azzagrat]] or the Triple Realm. his existence a warning that not all that was beautiful was also good. All things were but playthings in the eyes of the '''Prince of Pleasure''', he simply hadn't claimed them yet.

==Description==
[[File:Graz'zt - Jeremy Jarvis.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Graz'zt in all his handsome glory.'']]
Standing {{SI|9|feet|long=yes}} tall, Graz'zt appeared as a lithe, muscular large [[humanoid]]. His skin shone like polished [[obsidian]] and his eyes glittered with malevolent green light. He had yellowed fangs, pointed ears, and six slender fingers decorating each hand. He was sometimes described as having six small black horns half-hidden amid his thick black hair. These [[fiend]]ish traits were apparent, regardless of whatever form Graz'zt chose to take. He was considered the comeliest [[demon]] in the Abyss, and dressed in the most expensive and elegant finery on the entire plane.

==Personality==
[[File:Iggwilv summoning Graz'zt.jpg|right|thumb|''Graz'zt and Iggwilv.'']]
Wielding an [[acid]]-drenched [[greatsword]] in one hand and a profane [[tower shield]] in the other, the Dark Prince was a veritable killing machine when loosed upon the hordes of the Abyss. What's more, he had a vast repertoire of magical abilities at his disposal, making him a deadly magical opponent. Graz'zt's greatest weapons, however, were his mastery of seduction and guile. He entertained the notion that he was the most cunning and intelligent creature in the [[Abyss]]; indeed, there were few who could possibly contest such a claim.

==Relationships==
===The Material Plane===

Although he had not yet achieved divine status, Graz'zt was worshiped on the [[Material Plane]] by many monstrous races, most notably the [[lamia]]s. Many of his high priests, known as the Chosen, were female, and the rituals they performed were violent and involved themes of darkness and betrayal.

The Dark Prince was a deeply sexual, erotic being. He was known on many worlds only in legend, as a dark figure who visited [[witch]]es and sorcerers, granting them sexual favors as well as magical powers.

In the {{YearlinkName|-666}}, Graz'zt and [[Ayanna Orgolath]] had twin half-fiendish sons, named [[Ulthas Orgolath|Ulthas]] and [[Ulthar Orgolath|Ulthar]]. They would overthrow the [[lich]]-king of [[Narfell]], [[Belevan Crell|Belevan the Unliving]], and give rise to the [[Orgolath Dynasty]].

[[File:Graz'zt and Iggwilv - Wayne Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Graz'zt and Iggwilv.'']]
For a time, Graz'zt was trapped on the Material Plane world of [[Oerth]] by the witch-queen [[Iggwilv]], who used his insight to elevate her own power. Eventually, however, she succumbed to the Dark Prince's charms. Graz'zt ultimately returned to the Abyss, but rumors abounded that he did, in fact, fall in love with his captor. A son, Iuz, was born of their union.

Some sources claimed that Graz'zt was the creator of the Vasharans, a breed of vilely evil [[human]]s. Deemed cruel and soulless by the gods who created him, the Vasharans' ancestor was destroyed... but Graz'zt breathed new life into the corpse, long before he attained his present status. It was a terrifying legacy, for the Vasharans were obsessed with deicide, and destroying all gods became the reason for their existence.

===The Abyss===
Graz'zt was always attended by six powerful lamias, and his [[marilith]] escorts, [[Unhath]] and [[Reluhantis]], were never far from his side. [[Bodak]]s and similar horrors were found in his [[Argent Palace]].

Technically, every demon living within Graz'zt's world-spanning empire was considered one of his loyal servants; those who proved otherwise were fed to the carnivorous plants in his perfumed hanging gardens. Noteworthy minions included a hulking [[goristro]] named [[Orwantz]], who acted as Graz'zt's personal border control for Azzagrat, and [[Rule-of-Three]], a [[cambion]] who met secretly with other fiends of the [[Lower Planes]], to strategize an attack against the celestials.

Graz'zt's most powerful servant was a mysterious, hyper-intelligent demon named Verin. Like Graz'zt, Verin appeared almost human, but his skin was deathly pale, and he constantly oozed spiritual slime. Verin could change his form at will, and often created a black-skinned mirror image of himself, known as Ztefano. He served as the Dark Prince's majordomo and chief ambassador to the other demon lords.

The god [[Raxivort]] was once a servant of the Dark Prince.

===Enemies===
[[File:WaukeenAndGraz'zt.jpg|thumb|250px|''Graz'zt "hosting" Waukeen in the Abyss.'']]
Through his own schemings and mischief, Graz'zt became the chief enemy of [[Waukeen]], a goddess of wealth and merchantry. During the [[Time of Troubles]], the deity bargained for safe passage across Zelatar with information regarding a secret horde of treasure. Graz'zt readily accepted the offer, but betrayed Waukeen as soon as she arrived in the Abyss. Imprisoned in the Argent Palace, the goddess was forced to witness profane celebrations held in her honor.{{Cite dragon/355/Volo's Guide: Demon Cults of the Realms|71}}

Graz'zt warred with many other lords of the Abyss as well, including [[Baphomet]] and [[Yeenoghu]]. Thanks to the efforts of his son Athux, he overthrew the demon prince [[Adimarchus]], who ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 507: Occipitus|Occipitus]], the 507{{th}} layer of the Abyss.{{Cite dungeon/116/Asylum|61-62}}

[[File:Tasha & Graz'zt.png|left|thumb|''Graz'zt and Tasha.'']]
One of Graz'zt's most confusing enemies was the witch queen [[Iggwilv|Iggwilv (a.k.a. Tasha)]]. The two had been both lovers and bitter enemies over many years.{{Cite dragon/414/History Check: The Iggwilv-Graz'zt Affair}}

Two of Graz'zt's other greatest enemies were [[Malcanthet]], Queen of the [[Succubi]], and [[Gwynharwyf]], champion of the [[Celestial eladrin|eladrin]].{{Cite dungeon/149/Enemies of My Enemy|42}} His conflict with the former ended up involving [[Kostchtchie]], the Prince of Wrath, who swore revenge against Graz'zt for humiliating him, although Graz'zt himself did not consider the upstart demon lord as much of a threat.{{Cite dragon/345/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Kostchtchie: Prince of Wrath|25}}

==History==
[[File:Graz'zt vs heroes.png|thumb|''Graz'zt facing valiant heroes in the Abyss.'']]
There were several competing, often contradictory theories as to Graz'zt's origin, some of which claimed that he was not a native to the Abyss, but was once an [[archdevil]] who served [[Asmodeus]]. In one of these theories, Graz'zt was chosen to lead an invasion of the Abyss as part of the [[Blood War]]&mdash;and conquered three layers of the Abyss&mdash;but became corrupted by the chaotic forces he had been sent to destroy and renounced his allegiance to the devils.

Yet another theory suggested that Graz'zt was one of several demonic children of [[Pale Night]], sired after the fall of the [[obyrith]]s; this would make him the brother of several other demons, including [[Lupercio]], [[Vucarik]], [[Rhyxali]], and [[Zivorgian]]. Those who subscribed to this theory believed that Pale Night must have drawn some great evil entity to herself to father her children; suggestions for what this entity could have been included an evil god such as [[Set]], a [[baernoloth]], the patriarch of a race of immortal warriors from another reality, an Outer God of Crawling Chaos, and even a sentient portion of the Abyss itself. Some maintained that Asmodeus was drawn from the Nine Hells to mate with Pale Night, implying that there may be truth in both theories.{{Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince|10-11}}

During the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, on 15 Nightal, Graz'zt was summoned to the [[Deep Wastes|Underdark]] below the [[Earthfast Mountains]] near the [[Master's Library]], due to a ritual performed by [[Gromph Baenre]] that was originally meant to summon and bind [[Demogorgon]], but which failed and instead summoned several Demon Lords in various locations throughout the Underdark.<ref> In this location, he subdued a force of [[Zhentarim]].
