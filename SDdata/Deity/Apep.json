        "Description": "Apep's body measured roughly {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} in length.",
        "Personality": "Apep was said by both his enemies and worshipers to have no creed but destruction. Particularly the destruction of the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic gods]], their temples, their [[cleric]]s, and their worshipers.",
        "Abilities": "Apep's [[avatar]] form had a [[poison]]ous bite, could [[dragon breath|breath fire]], and had a scaly hide that only ''[[item enchantment|+3 or greater]]'' weapons could injure. Non-magical weaponry would shatter if it struck his hide.\n\nHe was capable of creating any [[potion]], [[scroll]], or [[wand]] containing a [[spell]] from the [[Fire domain]]. As well as weapons with the [[weapon quality|enchantments]] ''[[flaming]]'' or ''[[flaming burst]]''. But such items could not exceed a value of 4,500 [[gold piece]]s.\n\nSome of the many spells Apep's avatar form was capable of casting included the following, with spells related to animals affecting only snakes and other reptiles:\n: ''[[animal growth]]'', ''[[animal shapes]]'', ''[[animal trance]]'', ''[[blasphemy]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[create undead]]'', ''[[creeping doom]]'', ''[[desecrate]]'', ''[[dispel good]]'', ''[[elemental swarm]]'' (fire only), ''[[eyebite]]'', ''[[fire seeds]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', ''[[fire storm]]'', ''[[greater magic fang]]'', ''[[incendiary cloud]]'', ''[[magic circle against good]]'', '''[[magic fang]]'', [[poison (spell)|''poison'']], ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[protection from good]]'', ''[[resist elements]]'' (fire or ice only), ''[[shapechange]]'', ''[[summon monster IX]]'' (as evil spell only), ''[[unholy aura]]'', ''[[unholy blight]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''.",
        "Realm": "Apep dwelled in the [[Abyss]],<ref group=\"note\" name=\"clarify\">Though this was done by the worshipers of the Pharaonic gods, there is nothing to indicate the practice was similarly carried out by worshipers of the Mulhorandi gods.",
        "Relationships": "Apep was served by hordes of [[demon]]s, most of them sharing fiery or serpentine qualities. He was also served by numerous [[flame snake]]s, a species of serpent that were related to him.<ref>\n\nHe was chiefly an enemy of Pharaonic pantheon, the group of gods that would one day become the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]. He was once a servant of the Pharaonic god [[Set]], fighting the goddess [[Bast]] on a daily basis in an effort to destroy the [[Matet|solar barge]] of [[Re]], but Set eventually allied with the rest of the Pharaonic gods against him.\n\nHis greatest enemies among the Pharaonic deities were [[Osiris]] and Bast.<ref>",
        "Worshipers": "The worshipers of Apep were typically deranged, corrupt, or otherwise evil beings. Worship of him was more cultic than a proper structured religion &mdash; his worshipers carried no [[holy symbol]]s, wore no priestly vestments, and met their fellow cultists only in secrecy. This was all because if any of the Pharaonic gods were to notice their worship of Apep, they would have wrath brought down upon them.\n\nApep's followers believed that his only creed was destruction and thus the ultimate goal they strove towards was an end to existence.\n\nMost of his worshipers were [[human]]s and intelligent snakes, especially the latter under his aspect Repra. A few evil creatures served him as clerics, particularly serpentine creatures, such as dragons, [[naga]]s, and [[yuan-ti]]. Though worship by yuan-ti occurred on worlds other than Toril.<ref> Among openly evil creatures these clerics flaunted their position and power, often constructing elaborate temples to Apep in secluded mountains or deep in deserts. These typically featured multitudes of snakes and serpentine motifs.\n\nIn the [[Domains of Dread]], Apep was worshiped in the [[w:c:ravenloft:Island of Terror|Island of Terror]] known as [[w:c:ravenloft:Sebua|Sebua]] under the alias Apophis. There a manifestation of Apep stood within a temple dedicated to him, guarding the heart of the domain's darklord."
