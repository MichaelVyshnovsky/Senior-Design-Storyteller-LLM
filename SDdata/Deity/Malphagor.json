        "mainbody": "alphagor was a Tanarri Prince and an upstart deity of the undead worshiped in the Underdark region underneath the Vast, and the necromancy portfolio from Velsharoon.\nFollowers of the deity believed that raising the undead was giving them the \"Blessing of Malphagor\" and the dead individual souls were gifts to the god who, in exchange, gives them eternal unlife. The center of Malphagorian worship was located on the far side of the Sea of Endless Darkness in relation to Ravens Bluff, about a months time travel.\nMalphagors cult became a common knowledge after the expedition from Ravens Bluff descended into the Underdark and established the Ravens Deep settlement in the . Expedition members ran into several powerful cultists of Malphagor near the Watch Post Cavern, led by Filas, a ranking human lich priest of the upstart deity. The war band under Filass, leadership consisted of Angor, a dwarven death knight and its eight dwarven skeleton warriors, Dannon, a dwarf vampire, and two of his thralls. The group set out to fight and kill a best of beholders and raise them as more of the undead followers of Malphagor. Despite their undead existence, the Malphagorians sought no trouble with the living Ravenaar and only wanted a passage to their secret mark. Only if the living were to promise their \"destiny\" to Malphagor would Filas reveal the groups true goals.\nBy the late 14 century DR, relatively recently before 1370 DR, the island town of Tradesport in the Sea of Endless Darkness faced an undead incursion. Several of the citys Trading Houses used undead workers, who rebelled when an ancient hidden crypt, part of the ancient temple of Set, opened, unleashing its shambling guardians. The unquiet dead began slaughtering everyone in their way, and only with the arrival of Malphagors priests the undead were pacified and forced under the priests control. The clergy of Malphagor demanded a section of the city to be given to them as payment. Since then, Malphagors followers had been an integral part of the citys commerce, trading in the undead servants created from the slaves exported out of Thay. Inhabitants of Tradesport showed no love for the deitys clergy nor for the gods undead servants. The Wail of the Banshee, a necromancers ship made of bone, operated out of Tradesport with its master, a drow necromancer named Mezzalcat serving Malphagor.\nCirca 1370 DR, the Cult of the Dragon, namely Shalimarra Daradusk of Ravens Bluff, allied with the clergy of Malphagor in the Vast, using the gods priest to help them raise white dragons as undead. During the same period of time, powerful priests of Malphagor visited the site of a great battle between drow and duergar in the Lower Sarbreen to collect bodies of the dead to be risen as servants of their deity. The human lich priest, Velcrest, showed no desire to fight adventurers from Ravens Bluff who came across the grim scavenging and, if left unprovoked, was happy to share information about his patron deity."
