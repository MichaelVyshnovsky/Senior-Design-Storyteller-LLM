We lay our hope in Pelor's hands.|''A blessing of Pelor.''}}",
        "Description": "Pelor most often appeared as an elderly man with untamed golden hair and a bushy beard, dressed in white garb.\n\nHis [[avatar]]s appeared either in his own form, or that of young children of either sex.\n\nThe [[holy symbol]] of Pelor's faith was a circle with six points that radiated outwards.",

He and his clergy were not pacifists however, and the the Shining One brought down terrible wrath upon the forces of darkness in the [[multiverse]].",
        "Abilities": "On [[Oerth]], Pelor held dominion over the [[domain]]s of [[life domain|life]] and [[light domain|light]]. [[Good domain|goodness]], [[healing domain|healing]], [[Strength domain|strength]], and [[sun domain|the sun]].",
        "Possessions": "Pelor wielded a ''+5 [[flaming]] [[disruption]] [[heavy mace]]'' called ''Sunscepter''.\n\nHis ''[[Weapon of the deity|deific weapon]]'' was a ''+1 flaming heavy mace.''",
        "Divine Realm": "According to the [[World Tree cosmology|World Tree cosmological model]], Pelor resided within [[Thalasia]], the 4{{th}} layer of [[Elysium]], while the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis model]] stated he dwelled in the [[w:c:D&D4e:Hestavar|Bright City of Hestavar]] in the [[Astral Plane]], along with [[w:c:D&D4e:Erathis|Erathis]] and [[Ioun (deity)|Ioun]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Places of Worship": "Temples to Pelor were typically built from pure white materials and were kept immaculately clean. They were constructed to accommodate wide open spaces, or built to include numerous windows, in order for ample sunlight to shine within. They often housed functioning hospitals where Pelor's faithful could tend to the sick and wounded.\n\nA cult of Pelor in the [[Shadowfell]] believed that he and the [[Raven Queen]] were two reflections of a single entity, and sought to unite the two divine beings.\n\nThere was at least one known shrine to Pelor in [[Sigil]], the City of Doors.",
            "Notable Worshipers": "* [[Hector]], who posed as an innocent townsperson but was an [[oni night haunter]] in service of the [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] [[Thoran]].\n* [[Pentival]], a [[half-dragon]] [[paladin]] that ventured into the [[Tomb of Horrors]] long before the era of the [[Second Sundering]]."

        "Dogma": "Pelor's doctrine taught that strength was best exemplified with generosity and penitence. Those with true power never had to demonstrate it to others.",
        "Activities": "To some scholars, Pelor was known as the \"keeper of time\".",
        "Relationships": "Pelor was considered a hated foe of another interloper deity, the Midnight Serpent [[Zehir]].{{Cite dragon/415/Channel Divinty: Zehir, the Midnight Serpent|5}}\n\nLike other goodly deities, Pelor was served by a number of celestial [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]].",
        "History": "In the time before the [[Dawn War]], Pelor and the deities [[Tharizdun]] and Ioun discovered the [[Living Gate]] that separated the [[Far Realm]] from the [[Astral Sea]]. The three gods peered through it, learning terrible secrets that changed them forever. Corruptive energy from the Far Realm seeped out into the [[multiverse]], which in turn led to the formation of [[psionics|psionic power]]. Some time later, Pelor and the god Ioun managed to seal the barrier once again.\n\nThat latent psionic power permeated the world of [[Toril]] and affected the development of numerous civilizations, including the ancient empire of [[Jhaamdath]] and the wilds of the [[Vilhon Reach]]."
