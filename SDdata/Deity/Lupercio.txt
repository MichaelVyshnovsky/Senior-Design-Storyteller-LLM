Lupercio was a tanarri demon lord called The Baron of Sloth who was associated with sloth and darkness. Lupercio was most often lazy and ignored both his realm and the creatures that surrounded him, only occasionally moving manically and without form before falling again into apathy. Lupercio extinguished all light within a  radius of himself and, as a result, shadow demons often fed on the shadows he produced.
Darkness constantly wrapped around Lupercios body, rendering him impossible to see. But there were said to be three (or possibly four) signs of his presence first, a demonic smile of sharp teeth glittering in the darkness second, a basso, tittering laugh aweful enough to chill the blood of slaadi and thirdly, his immense strength. The fourth sign, if there was one, was unknown.
Lupercio ruled the 128 layer of the Abyss, Slugbed.
Lupercioâ€™s mother was Pale Night. He had multiple siblings amongst the demon lords, including Vucarik, the Consort of Chains Zivorgian, the Lady of Ripe Carrion Lady Rhyxali, the Demon Princess of Shadow and potentially Grazzt, the Dark Prince.
