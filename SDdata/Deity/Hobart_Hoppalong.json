        "mainbody": "'''Hobart Hoppalong''' was a mortal who achieved apotheosis in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], becoming a [[quasi-deity]] protector of children and patron of humor, pranks, and insanity.",
        "Possessions": "Hobart Hoppalong was surrounded by an aura of [[wild magic]] caused by the ''[[amulet of anarchy]]'' that he wore around his neck. The amulet contained pieces of both [[Limbo]] and [[Pandemonium]] within. The ''wild magic'' extended {{SI|600|yard|long=yes}} in all directions with Hobart being in the \"eye of the storm\", allowing his own spells to function normally.{{Cite organized play/LC/Fool's Luck|5}}",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Hobart reached the fabled [[Valley of the Gods]] and, through that act, he was elevated to the status of a quasi-deity. However, his newfound divinity was not well-received, and the other gods cursed the fledgling deity, binding him to the [[Prime Material plane]]. However, Hobart Hoppalong was not the kind of man to despair. He hatched a scheme to absorb as much [[magic]] from [[enchanted]] items as he could in hopes of accumulating enough power to reach the [[planes]] and create a [[divine realm]] there to lord over.\n\nWhilst locked into a prime-bound existence, Hobart Hoppalong traveled the Realms and worked as a musician to entertain himself. On one work trip, Hobart ended up on the road to [[Ravens Bluff]], where he met a group of travelers led by [[Donavil Grapevine]], all soaked in curious magic from the [[half-elf]]'s magic [[staff]]. His interest peaked, Hoppalong decided to tag along as their entertainer. The band ended up stealing a shipment of [[wine]]s intended for a wedding in the Living City. Hobart used his magic and mischievous nature to briefly ''[[teleport]]'' back to the Bluff in order to find a group of [[adventurer]]s to retrieve the wine and Hoppalong himself, delivering them to Ravens Bluff, just in time for the godling's hired performance.\n\nHobart took on the guise of [[Victor Vango]] of [[B&V Security Agency]] and contracted a group of adventurers to perform the retrieval. Ironically enough, no illusion or lie was needed as the real Victor intended to do just that himself regardless as the wine and Hobart's performance was intended for his twin sister [[Victoria Vango]]'s wedding.{{Cite organized play/LC/Fool's Luck|3}} Following the recruitment, Hobart guided the adventures to Donavil's hideout via prank contraptions and an animated doll named [[Wood E. Barkley]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Fool's Luck|4}}\n\nSubsequently, Hobart Hoppalong consumed the powerful magic [[staff]] after Donavil was defeated, revealing his deception to the adventurers, who escorted the godling to Ravens Bluff. Hobart gave gifts from his magic hat to every child they met along the way.{{Cite organized play/LC/Fool's Luck|9}}"
