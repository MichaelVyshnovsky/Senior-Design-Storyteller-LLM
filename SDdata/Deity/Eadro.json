        "mainbody": "Eadro () was the creator of the locathah and merfolk and was worshiped exclusively by those two races, though each worshiped him differently. He was part of theÂ asathalfinare pantheon, an alliance of good-aligned gods of aquatic races.\nThe merfolk worshiped Eadro with passion, making their supplications open to non-merfolk so that they might hear songs devoted to him. The songs and swimming dances they used in prayer changed with every season as well as during their numerous holidays. They were accepting of the differences in the locathahs beliefs, but these beliefs were confusing to the merfolk.\nThe locathah worshiped him as the Deliverer. Only males were allowed in the clergy and their religious practices were kept secret from all others. They used prayer as a form of redemption from the punishment they believed was bestowed upon their race for improper worship, pointing to the frequent enslavement of the locathah by others and their scaly bodies as opposed to the merfolks smoother ones. They aimed to use their prayer to be redeemed and transformed into merfolk.\nAfter 500 years of this type of worship, some locathah began to worship other sea deities at Myth Nantar, preaching acceptance of the bodies and abilities Eadro gave them."
