        "Description": "Kagyar had the appearance of a savage, hairy and bearded savage man with deep-set, somewhat beady eyes. Dressed in a set of plain gray [[robe]]s and hood.",
        "Personality": "Kagyar's view on life revolved entirely around artistic pursuits, caring very little about what was going on around him and whether non-creative mortals lived or died.",
        "Activities": "Normally, Kagyar only interacted with mortals when he wanted to persuade them to save some endangered work of art. But sometimes, he would provide struggling artists the inspiration, motivation, or spiritual help they needed to achieve the great potential they had.\n\nBeyond his home world of Mystara, Kagyar engaged in activities on a variety of [[plane]]s across the [[multiverse]].<ref>",
        "Possessions": "Kagyar carried a [[hammer]] and [[chisel]] with him wherever he went, having them double as weapons. These had a ''+4'' and ''+3 [[item enchantment|enchantment]]'' respectively.",
        "History": "Kagyar began life on Mystara as Ka-Gar, a member of a mortal race of [[neanderthal]]-like [[humanoid]]s. In this life he lived as a cave painter and rock carver. At some point, Kagyar obtained immortality.\n\nSome time in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Kagyar reached beyond his native world and contacted a dwarf on Toril by the name of [[Norin Bonebreaker]]. He granted the man a limited list of [[cleric]]al [[spell]]s and tasked him with helping the unfortunate, but only in secrecy.{{Cite polyhedron/59/The Living City: The Two Brothers' Butchery|9}}"
