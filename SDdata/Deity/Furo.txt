'''Furo''' was the [[Padhrasattva]] of Knowledge within the [[Padhran religion]]. He was the patron god of the [[Red Mountain Sect]] and the [[Red Mountain Temple]] of [[Khazari]]. He was known as '''Furo the Mighty'''.

==Doctrine==
The Red Mountain priests could describe Furo as a divine agent of the [[Enlightened One]]. Faithful therefore followed the Enlightened One's teachings, yet prayed to Furo. His followers meditated and taught others to spread his belief. They did not summon their god to do their bidding, but rather served him. Nevertheless, they described Furo as "both wondrous and terrible".

Furo's teachings took the form of a number of [[sutra]]s. In keeping with the teachings of the Enlightened One, they endeavored for purity in body and mind to seek Furo. For example, the Red Mountain Sect were celibate and they were commanded to refrain from strong alcoholic drinks and eating meat.

==History==
Furo once fought the evil spirit [[Cham Loc]].

In the Red Mountain Temple, scrolls depicted the mighty Furo in battle with ugly, blue-skinned [[ogre magi]].

The [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] was a follower of Furo. In his book, ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]'', in [[1362 DR]] he wished to quote a verse of the ''[[Yanitsava]]'' to invoke Furo's blessing.

==Activities==
It was said by the [[Red Mountain Sect]] that thunderstorms were battles between Furo and the evil spirits of the earth.

==Magic==
Koja once prayed to the Ten-Thousand Protective Images of Furo, whilst preparing for a tense confrontation between [[Yamun Khahan]] and [[Bayalun]] and [[Chanar Ong Kho]].
