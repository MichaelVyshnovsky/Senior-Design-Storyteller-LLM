Furo was the Padhrasattva of Knowledge within the Padhran religion. He was the patron god of the Red Mountain Sect and the Red Mountain Temple of Khazari. He was known as Furo the Mighty.
The Red Mountain priests could describe Furo as a divine agent of the Enlightened One. Faithful therefore followed the Enlightened Ones teachings, yet prayed to Furo. His followers meditated and taught others to spread his belief. They did not summon their god to do their bidding, but rather served him. Nevertheless, they described Furo as "both wondrous and terrible".
Furos teachings took the form of a number of sutras. In keeping with the teachings of the Enlightened One, they endeavored for purity in body and mind to seek Furo. For example, the Red Mountain Sect were celibate and they were commanded to refrain from strong alcoholic drinks and eating meat.
Furo once fought the evil spirit Cham Loc.
In the Red Mountain Temple, scrolls depicted the mighty Furo in battle with ugly, blue-skinned ogre magi.
The lama Koja of Khazari was a follower of Furo. In his book, A History of the Tuigan, in 1362 DR he wished to quote a verse of the Yanitsava to invoke Furos blessing.
It was said by the Red Mountain Sect that thunderstorms were battles between Furo and the evil spirits of the earth.
Koja once prayed to the Ten-Thousand Protective Images of Furo, whilst preparing for a tense confrontation between Yamun Khahan and Bayalun and Chanar Ong Kho.
