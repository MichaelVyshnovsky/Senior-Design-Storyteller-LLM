The Fate domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers inspired by fate.
Their ability to evade surprise attacks improved.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the true strike, augury, and bestow curse spells. Clerics of some experience could cast status, mark of justice, and geas/quest. Those that were masters of this domain had access to vision, mind blank, and foresight.
