        "mainbody": "__NOTOC__\n'''Jauhar''' was the goddess of wealth of [[Zakhara]]. She was technically only a [[Zakharan pantheon|local goddess]], but probably the most influential of those, as she was worshiped in a number of cities. In the [[Cities of the Pantheon]], she was seen as a [[Zakharan pantheon|Great Goddess]] and took the place of [[Jisan]] there. \n\nShe preached the importance of hard work to acquire riches. As such Jauhar was above such concerns as alignment, as wealth could be acquired to feed the hungry or to oppress the poor. Jauhar's symbol was a gold dinar.\n \nOld images showed the goddess as a beautiful dancer adorned with coins, but efforts had been made by her pantheist worshipers to destroy all such pictures as blasphemous. They instead describe her garbed in a chador, a garment covering a woman from head to foot, but with a gold [[dinar]] on her forehead.\n\nJauhar had many worshipers among merchants and craftsmen and filled a similar role in the Land of Fate as [[Waukeen]] did in [[Faer√ªn]]."
