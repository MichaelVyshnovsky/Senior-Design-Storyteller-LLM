        "Description": "The [[avatar]] of Anubis typically took the form of a man with the head of a [[jackal]]",
        "Personality": "Anubis held a great enmity towards [[thieves]], especially tomb robbers, as well as those who tried to raise the worshipers of Pharaonic deities from the dead.",
        "Powers": {
            "Spells": "The avatar of Anubis was capable of casting a variety of spells, though he particularly liked biting at foes with his canine head. The spells his avatar was capable of casting included the following:\n\n:''[[antimagic field]]'', ''[[calm emotions]]'', ''charm monster'', ''[[deathwatch]]'', ''[[death ward]]'', ''[[destruction]]'', ''[[dictum]]'', ''[[dispel chaos]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[gentle repose]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[identify]]'', ''[[imbue with spell ability]]'', ''[[magic circle against chaos]]'', ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'', ''[[Nystul's undetectable aura]]'', ''[[order's wrath]]'', ''[[protection from chaos]]'', ''[[protection from spells]]'', ''[[shield of law]]'', ''[[slay living]]'', ''[[speak with dead]]'', ''[[spell resistance]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', ''[[summon monster IX]]'' (law domain), ''[[surelife]]'', ''[[undeath to death]]'', and ''[[wail of the banshee]]''."
        },
        "Possessions": "The avatar of Anubis typically carried a scepter, a ''+5 [[disruption]] [[heavy mace]]'', and an [[ankh]]. This ankh was {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length, weighed {{SI|12|lb|k|long=yes}}, and made of bright blue stone. It could enact a ''[[true resurrection]]'' upon the corpse of any creature by making physical contact with it. And any non-divine being that tried to touch it would be afflicted by ''[[horrid wilting]]''.",
        "Realm": "Anubis made his home on the [[Astral Plane]] and was the sole deity in the [[multiverse]] to do so.",
        "Activities": "On very rare occasions, if a tomb held an image of Anubis within it and was being robbed, he would send his avatar to kill the tomb robbers.\n\nA slightly more common activity of Anubis, though still quite rare, was forcing people to go on some quest with the purpose of increasing the power of his local Church if they had dared to raise a worshiper of Pharaonic deities from the dead.",
        "Relationships": "Anubis was the son of the Pharaonic deities Nephthys and [[Osiris]].<ref> He was served by [[hound archon]]s that had the heads of jackals.",
        "Worshipers": "Compared to the other Pharaonic deities, Anubis had few [[cleric]]s and they were often unpopular due to their close associations with cemeteries and funerals, the latter of which they often officiated. In preparation for the afterlife, his worshipers practiced rigorous disciplines in order to hone both their minds and [[spirit]]s.\n\nThe temple layouts and priestly vestments of the Anubis faith were typical of Pharaonic deities. His temples were always located next to cemeteries and acted as embalming centers, funeral chapels, and guarded repositories of both [[magic]]al and sacred knowledge.",
        "History": "When the Pharaonic deities that would become the Mulhorandi pantheon traveled to Toril, Anubis sent with the goddess Nephthys a cadre of his hound archons to serve her, among them one who was known as [[Thah Rahalar]].\n\nSome time after this, it was believed by many planar travelers that Anubis had distanced himself from the Pharaonic pantheon and became a guard of the [[dead power]]s that floated in the Astral Plane, becoming known as the \"Guardian of the Dead Gods\".{{Cite dragon/359/Forgotten Faiths|121-122}} However, there never ceased to be an Anubis in the Pharaonic pantheon. Some believers of the former tried to rationalize this by claiming Anubis was replaced by a deity of the same name or that he had split his divinity into an [[aspect]]."
