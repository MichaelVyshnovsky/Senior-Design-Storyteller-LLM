The '''Portal domain''' was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and powers related to magic ''[[portal]]s''. They gained the ability to sense nearby portals, regardless of said ''portals<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' activity.

==Powers==
A priest with this domain could identify a ''portal'', whether or active or inactive, the same way others would find a secret door.

==Spells==
Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[summon monster I]]'', ''[[analyze portal]]'', and ''[[dimensional anchor]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', and ''[[banishment]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[etherealness]]'', ''[[dimensional lock]]'', and ''[[gate]]''.Originally giving ''[[maze]]'', this was exchanged for ''dimensional lock'' in ''Player's Guide to Faer√ªn'' for v.3.5.

A priest of the [[Underdark]] with this domain had an alternative suite of spells. 
Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[portal stabilization]]'', ''analyze portal'', and ''[[portal view]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''dimension door'', ''[[portal barricade]]'', and ''[[portal-to-portal redirect]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[etherealness]]'', ''[[portal reformat]]'', and ''[[gate]]''.
