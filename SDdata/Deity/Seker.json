        "mainbody": "Seker was a god of light and the afterlife in the Pharaonic pantheon, a group of deities that eventually became the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nSekers avatar had the appearance of an ordinary human man.\nthumb|338x338px|Seker fires a ray of light from his palm to destroy a ghoul, ghost, and mummy.\nSeker could shapechange at will and was able to shoot beams of light from his hands out to  that would destroy any undead that they hit.\nSeker typically fought with either a halberd or a +3 mace with an effect similar to the disintegrate spell.\nIn the kingdom of Bakar, a survivor state of the Imaskar Empire, Seker was viewed by the people as a purifier of undead and restless spirits. In times of great need he would bestow upon the people a magic item known as the harness of Seker.\nBy the 14 century DR, there were still some nomads in the Raurin Desert that showed reverence for Seker.\nThis deity relentlessly fought to destroy all evil and undead, much like the Faer√ªnian power Lathander. Believing that all undead were merely dead spirits that had not yet realized their true state.\nSeker dwelled within the divine domain of Ro Stau, which stood in the plane of Elysium but alternated between the layers of Amoria and Thalasia.\nSeker was a cousin of the deity Shu\nA bariaur by the name of Imhotep served Seker as a proxy.\nSeker was typically worshiped by those who worshiped light and by some quesar. Worshipers were known to make sacrifices to him in the form of jewelry. Sekers priests typically wore white tunics and feathered helmets as part of their priestly vestments."
