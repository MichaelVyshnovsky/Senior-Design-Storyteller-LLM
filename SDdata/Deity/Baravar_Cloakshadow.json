        "mainbody": "Baravar Cloakshadow (), known as the Sly One, was the neutral good gnome deity of illusion and deception. His dogma primarily concerned the protection of the gnome race through the art of illusion.\nBaravar was closely allied with the other non-evil members of the gnome pantheon. His other allies were Azuth, Brandobaris, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Erevan Ilesere, Mystra, Sehanine Moonbow, Tymora, and Vergadain.  His chief enemies were the deities of the goblin and kobold races. Other foes were Cyric (for killing his one-time ally, Leira), Abbathor, Mask, and Urdlen.\nClerics of Baravar were generally sneaky, smart gnomes, who served their communities by instructing them in disguise and camouflage. They prayed for their spells at dusk, and venerated Baravar in a monthly ritual known as \"the Cloaking\". The Cloaking was most often held in public places under the new moon, and it was considered a point of honor that outsiders never realized what was happening.\nIn the Outlands a sprawling, richly decorated and well-staffed temple of Baravar stood within The Ladys Ward of the city of Sigil.\n* Ompahr Daergech, extremely old high priest of the Warrens beneath Waterdeep."
