}}The '''World Serpent''' was an ancient, enigmatic entity worshiped by the [[sarrukh]] during the [[Days of Thunder]]. Some believe the World Serpent was one of the enigmatic [[primal spirit]]s.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|61}}

==Background==
It was believed by some scholars that the World Serpent was an archetype of a complex concept: that of the multiplicity of being. Because of that, it was believed that some of the ancient deities of other scaly races, such as [[Asgorath]], [[Shekinester]] and [[Jazirian]], who had or represented multiple [[alignment]]s, were aspects of the World Serpent.

==History==
According to some sarrukh myths and legends, the World Serpent led the elder [[god]]s against the [[primordial]]s in the [[Dawn War]], during the [[Shadow Epoch]].

Myth taught that the World Serpent approached the sarrukh while they were still a race of savages, and offered to teach them the secrets behind civilized life, how to claim power, and the [[magic|art of magic]]. In return for these divine boons, the World Serpent required worship and sacrifices from the sarrukh, to which they agreed.

During the height of the sarrukh empire, around {{Yearlink|-35000}}, the World Serpent was universally worshiped among the sarrukh, as well as forced upon their servitor and enslaved races. This was soon followed by several additional aspects, and by the time of the fall of the sarrukh empires, around {{Yearlink|-33500}}, the worship of the World Serpent directly had almost completely ceased, though it still granted powers through its several aspects.

In the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], the worship of the primal spirits became a common thing in places such as the [[Moonshae Isles]], where the World Serpent was venerated among other primal beings. Its worshipers considered it one of the mightiest incarnations of nature's power, and it was the best known of the elder spirits.
