        "mainbody": "Besides sailors, he was venerated by many along the coasts who made their living from the sea, ranging from rich merchants to simple fisherfolk.\n\nIn the past, [[Northlander]]s only honored Valkur occassionally as a result of the unreliability of his protection. In more recent times, he had become their unique god, the mighty deity they revered and honored above all others. In him they saw embodied and exemplified the traits that they, particularly their warriors, most admired and treasured: strength, courage, ferocity, guile, and sailing skill. To question, let alone insult this veneration was not advisable.\n\nValkur was venerated by the humans and general [[half-elf]] populance of [[Aglarond]]. He was a favored deity in [[Impiltur]], [[Tharsult]],{{Cite web/Player's Guide to Faerûn Errata|1}} and [[Wizard's Reach]], appeased and beseeched by sea traders in [[Amn]], and significiant in areas where [[Illuskan]]s and [[Tethyrian]]s lived together.\n\n[[Water genasi]] tended towards deities of water, including Valkur. Those who revered him were respected by common sailors and welcomed aboard by captains, as even those without a taste for adventure loved working on boats. Clerics among [[air genasi]] were also known to choose Valkur as a patron.\n===Dogma===\nValkur's doctrine placed emphasis on the importance of defying the odds and daring the impossible. This exploratory spirit was seen as both necessary to spread the reach of humanity and for the thrill in and of itself. It was a philosophy of carpe diem that embraced risk and viewed life on a ship, feeling and fighting the elements themselves, as the greatest, most invigorating feeling in the world. Notably, his dogma encouraged self-sufficiency and independence from his followers and placed himself third in their list of priorities, their loyalties going first to their crew and second to their ship.\n\n===Rituals===\nClerics of Valkur prayed for their spells around dawn, upon the stirring of the first breeze. Valkur's church celebrated only one holy day known as the Shattering. The exact date of the festival varied but it was always celebrated in the spring. The purpose of the festival was to celebrate the breaking up of ice floes in the north, which marked the beginning of the sailing season.\n\nValkur's name was spoken to bless the spirits of dead sailors and lost ships.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Valkur often manifested as an aurora borealis or aurora australis and sailors swore he appeared to becalmed ships at sea as a ghostly wind in which his image could be faintly glimpsed. Sometimes he manifested as a ghostly ship on the horizon, which always sailed to the nearest port but never seemed to get closer or farther away.\n\nValkur was served by many intelligent and benevolent animals, including [[dolphin]]s, [[whale]]s (especially [[narwhal]]s), and sea birds. He used the latter to indicate his mood, manifesting as a silver [[albatross]] or [[gull]] drifting on the wind currents to indicate his favor and as a night black [[raven]] to convey his displeasure."
        },
        "Personality": "Valkur was usually jolly and never held a grudge. He was a figure of endless luck and great boldness, emphasizing his points by shaking his fist in the air and never backing away from a challenge. his moods as mercurial as the weather, but he was always extremely loyal to his crew and did in fact feel his primary responsibility was protecting sailors. Though still unreliable, he had become more responsive to his faithful's petitions after the [[Time of Troubles]].",
        "Powers": "Valkur could pilot any sailing craft in any conditions, and no ship on which he stood would ever sink regardless of its condition or the surrounding weather. He was specialized in the use of [[cutlass]]es, [[harpoon]]s, and [[trident]]s, and proficient in the use of all melee weapons and naval armaments, as well as the [[arquebus]]. He favored [[conjuration]], [[divination]], and [[evocation]] spells, as well as those from the [[sphere]]s of [[Divination sphere|divination]], [[Elemental air sphere|air]], [[elemental water sphere|water]], and [[weather sphere|weather]].\n\nThe Captain of the Waves could function just as well in water as he could above it and stride knee-deep through water of any depth using a form of modified ''[[water walk]]ing'', hence his ability to seemingly wade through the ocean. Each hour he could call 2-5 whales to come to his aid, usually a pod of narwhals or [[orca]]s, but on rare occasions (about 1 in 20 times) a single [[leviathan (creature)|leviathan]] would answer his summons.\n\nValkur could change the weather within a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} radius of himself, calming stormy seas simply by placing his hand on the water's surface or stirring up storms by swirling his hand within it. He could breathe a ''[[gust of wind]]'' every minute and breathe water as air. In addition to being undrownable, he was immune to [[elemental water]] [[spell]]s, [[water elemental]]s and related creatures, and electricity and lightning. He could bestow all these immunities, and the ability to swim, to anyone he touched, a blessing known as the \"shield of Valkur\" which lasted for a day.",
        "Possessions": "Valkur wielded the ''[[Captain's Cutlass]]'', a ''+3'' weapon able to cast a weather-related spell every minute, its power varying based on the aptitude of the wielder. Though normally a cutlass, it could transform into a trident or harpoon with an unbreakable [[rope]] tether attached to the wielder's wrist that could extend as required by the user. The weapon was sized for Valkur, had increased range in his hand, and (so long as the line was attached to him) left him unable to be knocked over or toppled from a deck he stood upon. Sometimes he loaned it to the faithful or those on special missions for him, but in anyone else's hands it was normal sized and had normal range.\n\nValkur also possessed a great [[shield]] with which he turned back the worst that nature had to throw at him. In some religious images he was at the helm of the great [[galleon]] ''[[Windjammer]]'', a ship able to not only sail across any sea, but even through the heavens.",
        "Realm": "Valkur's realm was located in either [[Ysgard]] in the [[Great Wheel Cosmology]], His domain stood apart from the others, primarily due to the terrain but also for its relative calm. [[Safe Harbor]], as it was called, was a placid range of saltwater between two warzones, a desert battlefield and a larger watery expanse of raging naval battles.",
        "Activites": "Valkur often used the tether ability of the Captain's Cutlass to tow ships to shore, hauling them in hand-over-hand, and there was at least one occurrence where he harpooned a sea monster and used it for tow. Some claimed to have seen him stride through the waves dragging a small boat to sailors who went overboard, feeding them with the [[sea biscuit]]s and [[cask]]s of water contained within.",
        "Relationships": "Valkur looked to [[Selune]] for guidance across the oceans of Faerun, the two sharing such a friendship that the moon goddess passed on a minor blessing to Valkur's faithful in the form of improved navigational abilities. and [[Istishia]], the elemental god of water, had ties to Valkur even if he was uninterested in his sailors (or Umberlee's storms for that matter).\n\nThe [[Red Knight]], and by extension [[Tempus]], attempted to persuade Valkur in taking a greater interest in the area of naval conflict. but she still saw him as her best ally in that field even despite his unreliability. Tempus himself was casually friendly with Valkur, as he was at least somewhat martially-inclined, and at one point the sailor's god become an [[exarch]] of his.\n\nValkur was the sworn foe of the Gods of Fury, as the Captain of the Waves protected ships from the destruction wrought by their leader [[Talos]], invoked as he was by sailors to intercede with favorable winds. His true nemesis among them however was the Sea Queen Umberlee, whose cruel whimsy he defended sailors against. She might yet try to destroy the upstart for daring to challenge her dominion, but as far as could be discerned he continued to defy her without significant retribution.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Valkur's doctrine placed emphasis on the importance of defying the odds and daring the impossible. This exploratory spirit was seen as both necessary to spread the reach of humanity and for the thrill in and of itself.

        },
        "History": "Valkur's worship originated in [[North Faerûn]] centuries before the 13{{th}} century. He seemed tied to the story of a legendary captain from [[Mintarn]], a mortal sailor (possibly himself) who challenged Umberlee and emerged victorious against all odds. From there his faith spread quickly to Tethyr and Amn, where it became centered,\n\nValkur's activities during the [[Time of Troubles]] were unclear.{{cite web/The Avatar Trilogy: The Gods Walk Toril}} Since then, he had worked on his unresponsiveness, which resulted in northern sailors trying to placate the Gods of Fury rather than seek his unreliable protection. Although his help still could not be relied upon, he had become more attentive to entreaties from his faithful. In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], his focus had notably recentered to the North to the point he was considered a deity of Northlander sailors.",
        "Trivia": "The sight of a species of spined-fish named [[Valkur's fish]], so called for the belief that Valkur left the dark, eye-like spot on their side with his thumb, was considered good luck.\n\nIn the Valkuryte faith, the northern tropic was called [[Trethen]] and the southern tropic [[Lonthen]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n     | title      = Questions For Ed Greenwood\n     | author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n     | topicid    = \n     | postid     = \n     | whichpage  = \n     | date       = \n     | accessdate = 2022-09-30}}"
