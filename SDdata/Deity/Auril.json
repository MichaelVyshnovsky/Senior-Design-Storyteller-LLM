In fact, she became so powerless that she could be slain by mortal creatures, which could force her to be banished until the next winter solstice.",
        "Description": "Auril was known to take several distinct forms. The first was a furious figure of action known as '''The Frostmaiden''', the most frequently seen [[avatar]] in all but south and east Faerun. The Frostmaiden appeared as a lithe, attractive [[human]] woman with blue skin and a body made from ice and snow, her free-flowing hair long and white. She wore a fine, thickly furred gown and frost swirled around her.\n\nAuril's other form was the '''Icedawn''', an impassive apparition of icy hauteur that silently glided through the air. The Icedawn wore an ornate crown and hooked, spurred armor of opaque and light blue ice.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century, Auril had another three new avatars; the '''Cold Crone''' appeared as a {{SI|7|feet|long=yes}} tall, hunched bipedal creature with a snowy [[owl]]'s head topped by a pair of curled ram's horns. She had cloven hooves, arms ending in sharp, black talons, and grayish-white wolf fur covering her from the neck down.\n\nAuril's second form was the '''Brittle Maiden''' or '''Lady Icekiss''', a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall figure of fearsome feminine aspect with a thin cloak of mist surrounding her and eyes that burned with a cold, blue light. Made entirely of ice and frost, her body crackled while she moved, with icy blades growing from her form at odd angles and breaking off after growing too long.\n\nAuril's third form was called '''Winter's Womb''' (or the '''Queen of Frozen Tears''' by her most devoted). It was a {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} in diameter diamond of ice with facets and a sharp point at the bottom. Hovering in the air, the diamond contained her divine spark and radiated intense cold in every direction, her voice seeming to emanate from its heart.",
        "Personality": "Arrogant and vain,\n\nDespite being capricious, fickle and unpredictable,",
        "Divine Realm": "Auril had a [[divine realm]] called [[Winter's Hall]] in [[Pandesmos]], the topmost layer of [[Pandemonium]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. [[Norse pantheon|Norse]] god [[Wikipedia:Loki|Loki]] also made Winter's Hall his abode, a place to hide away whenever he fell out of grace with the other [[Norse pantheon|Aesir]].<ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]], Auril's realm was located within the [[Astral dominion|Astral Dominion]] of the [[Deep Wilds]] and was known as the [[Land Under Eternal Ice]].",
        "Relationships": "In earlier centuries, Auril was a member of the Deities of Fury, along with [[Malar]], [[Umberlee]], and [[Talos]], and used their combined destructive powers to inspire much reverent fear and tribute. Meanwhile she and Malar mutually hated each other. Umberlee was the only one she cooperated with to some degree of confidence, but eventually the wrathful sea goddess came to despise her enduring cold and the motionless sheets of ice her roiling seas were turned into, forming an alliance with the other Gods of Fury against the Frostmaiden.\n\nFollowing the Spellplague, Auril gained significant power by siphoning the faiths of [[Ulutiu]], [[Aerdrie Faenya]], and [[Gruumsh]]/[[Talos]] into her own. In addition to her classic portfolio of cold and winter, the Frostmaiden claimed dominion over wind and storms, bringing her into direct conflict with the ancient primordial power [[Akadi]].{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|61}}\n\nAuril and [[Chauntea]] were mortal enemies, constantly battling each other. [[Sune]] opposed Auril, as she blamed her for the destruction of much that was beautiful.<ref> [[Uthgar]] despised Auril because the [[Elk tribe]] abandoned him for her faith.<ref> [[Rellavar Danuvien]], a minor [[elf|elven]] [[deity|god]] of cold, sought to interfere in the plans of Auril whenever he could.{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited|16}}\n\nAt one stage, Auril was in a relationship with [[Thrym]], god of the frost giants. During that time she became the mother to the [[empyrean]] daughter [[Nalkara]].",

            "Holy Days": "* Midwinter (Night), [[Hammer 30]] to [[Alturiak 1]]. This was the most holy night of the year for the clergy, a festival of ice-dancing that lasted all night. [[Druid]]s were also known to pay respect to the Frostmaiden on this date.\n* The [[Coming Storm]] and the [[Last Storm]], informal but enthusiastically celebrated rituals where the priests gathered and called howling ice storms down on a region to mark the onset and end of winter.\n* [[Auril's Blesstide]], or Auril's Day, was a holiday (of sorts) held annually in the city of [[Waterdeep]] on the first day of new frost in the year. It was not so much a holiday as a way to seek to appease the Frostmaiden in hopes of a mild winter.",
