        "History": "Ramman led [[Unther]] to its first victories as a strong and fair champion. He led Unther in battle against the [[Imaskari]] and defended Unther during the [[Orcgate Wars]]. Later, around the 400's [[DR]], Ramman joined [[Gilgeam]] in Unther and drove out the rival storm deity [[Assuran]].{{Cite web/Books/The Alabaster Staff: A History of Unther}}\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], Assuran appeared on [[Toril]] in [[Akanax]], taking the body of King [[Hippartes]] of [[Chessenta]] as his avatar. He would lead an army into Unther, As their forces fought and their avatars went toe-to-toe, Ramman sent out a thunderous lightning attack on Assuran. With a powerful [[spell]] Assuran sent the lightning rebounding back to the storm god. Before Assuran could seize his portfolio from the dying god, Ramman passed it on to [[Anhur]], the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi god]] of warfare.\n\nIn the midst of his death, thirteen of Ramman's scouts were drenched in his blood and absorbed some of his power, becoming [[spellthief|spellthieves]]. They later came together and formed an organization known as [[Fallen Justice]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Factotums and Spellthieves}}"
