        "mainbody": "ssylliss was a demigod of the lizardfolk with dominion over their race, but he was nearly forgotten by them. Essylliss was considered an aspect of the World Serpent.\nFollowing the creation of the lizardfolk race by the sarrukh, the World Serpent worried they would be distracted by the call of the many other gods and that they needed a deity of their own. Thus he created a fragment of himself in the semblance of a lizardman, Essylliss.\nWorship of Essylliss survived the decline of sarrukh rule in Mhairshaulk for some two millennia, until around . However, the divided factions of lizardfolk eventually began to worship Semuanya, another fragment of the World Serpent representing the instinct to survive.\nBy the 14th century DR, almost no trace of Essylliss survived and only a small number of lizardfolk continued to worship him.\nEssyllisss favored weapon was the club. Clerics of Essylliss who cast weapon of the deity received a +1 impact club."
