        "mainbody": "The Ruby DragonPrince of Neutral Dragons\nSardior () was the dragon god of night, psionics, and secrets, and he was also the Master of gem dragons.\nSardior was said to be a unique ruby dragon. In his natural form, he had a long and sinewy body covered with deep ruby red scales. At a distance, he was often mistaken for an ancient red dragon.\nDespite appearing as a red dragon at first glance, Sardiors playful demeanor soon betrayed his true self. He was reputed to be a great conversationalist, and many who met him were unprepared for his sharp wit.\nSardiors demesne was a huge floating castle named the Ruby Palace, which orbited the world and always lay in the shadows from the sun. On the nights it was seen, viewers often mistook it for a small red moon.\nPeriodically, Sardior moved his fortress through the planes, visiting the djinni Citadel of Ice and Steel, and Uroboros, the realm of Jazirian.\nThroughout the history of Toril, Sardior worked covertly against the Phaerimm, any human rulers who sought to imprison or make use of psionicists, and any giants who sought hostile actions against dragons. These actions included seeking out dragons to slay them, destroy their eggs, or to conquer their lairs.\nOne of Sardiors greatest ongoing machinations on Toril was \"breeding\" more psionicists into the world by manipulating unions between sentient races. He felt this was necessary in order to balance out the worlds prevalence of arcane and divine magic users.\nSardior kept a court of five thanes, one for each of the various breeds of gem dragons. They were Aleithilithos, an amethyst dragon, Hrodel, a crystal dragon, Smargad, an emerald dragon, Charisma, a sapphire dragon, and Tithonnas, a topaz dragon. Sardior once had a sixth thane&mdashSeradess, an obsidian dragon&mdashbut he destroyed her and banished the obsidian dragons from his court. Even his own clergy didnt know the exact reason behind this decision.\nSardior was worshiped by neutral dragons, psions, and psychic warriors. He didnt require much from his followers, and didnt try to guide their decisions. Gem dragons, in return, viewed him as an ideal and strove to be more like him.\nSardior was always happy when he granted spells and special abilities to his followers. \nSardior had very few clerics. They usually dressed in the appropriate fashion for the area in which they resided, and then embellished the look with an abundance of jewelry in their everyday wear.\nMany sought out his clerics as sources of knowledge, as most of his followers were considered sages on various subjects. The temples gained their wealth by charging for these services. The prominent members of his temples also had social functions. They were personable, knowledgeable, and great storytellers. They showed little interest in politics, which made those around them less concerned with the information they revealed to the clergy.\nSardiors clergy was welcomed everywhere much as bards were. A small group of his clergy, known as the ruby disciples, trained to be a martial arm of the church, serving not only as a defense but also as a show of force.\nAs he wasnt as old as the other members of the draconic pantheon, having ascended to the status of lesser deity in relatively modern times, temples to Sardior were fewer than even his clerics. Temples dedicated to the Ruby Dragon were usually located in high areas that allowed clear views of the night sky but were close to a community of some sort. \nMost gem dragons kept a ruby on a small pedestal in their lairs as a shrine to him.\nAccording to the ancient draconic myth Elegy for the First World, Sardior was the first creation of the primordial dragons, Bahamut and Tiamat. He helped them to create the first metallic and chromatic dragons. When the gods of the Outer Planes invaded the Material plane, Sardior hid in the \"heart of creation\", and it is believed he died when the \"First World\" was destroyed. However, some sages believe that Sardiors consciousness survived, scattered and fused with all the worlds of the Material Plane. Its also said that the gem dragons were born from the remains of Sardiors consciousness."
