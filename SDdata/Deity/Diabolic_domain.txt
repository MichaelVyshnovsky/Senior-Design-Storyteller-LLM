The '''Diabolic domain''' was a suite of spells granted by entities, not necessarily of divine nature, who were of infernal nature. It granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and other powers related to [[devil]]s, the [[Hells]], and the [[planes]].

==Powers==
A priest with the Diabolic domain was capable of supernaturally becoming more persuasive, deceptive, intimidating, or better at seeing through people. However, they could only empower  one of these interpersonal skills once a day.

==Spells==
Two almost identical sets of spells were known.

As they advanced, a priest with this domain could acquire the traits and prowess of a devil, such as gaining a battle-ready tail with ''[[devil's tail]]'' (the later version replaced this with a simple ''[[protection from good]]''), seeing through even magical darkness with ''[[devil's eye]]'', and gaining a devil's charisma and otherworldly nature with ''[[devil's ego]]''. They could also command [[hellfire]], creating explosions of brimstone with ''[[Hellfire (spell)|hellfire]]'' and ''[[hellfire storm]]''. Finally, they could issue a ''[[demand]]'' over a distance and summon and bind [[outsider]]s with ''[[lesser planar binding|lesser]]'' and regular ''[[planar binding]]''. At the pinnacle, they could travel between planes directly with ''[[gate]]'' or gain the powers of a [[pit fiend]] with ''[[investiture of the pit fiend]]''.
