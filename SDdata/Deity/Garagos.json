        "mainbody": "'Garagos''' ({{Pronounce|GAH|rah|gohs|refs=}}), known as '''Targus''' in the times of ancient [[Netheril]], was a [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[demigod]] of war and [[exarch]] of [[Tempus]], '''Targus''' was the former [[Netherese pantheon|Netherese]] god of war and victory over beasts, especially [[Dragon|dragons]]. Seemingly existing only to destroy, '''The Reaver''' was a whirlwind of slaughter linked to the savage bloodlust that led to horrific carnage.{{Cite polyhedron/105/Forgotten Deities: Garagos|4}}",
        "Description": "Garagos preferred to appear as a scarred, rugged, {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} tall humanoid; he could grow arms out of his massive shoulders at will, never having fewer than five but unable to keep more than ten. He wielded a different weapon in each of his hands, from which streamed out a cloud of bloody mist. This mist surrounded him, and within it could be heard a faint, continuous wailing, said by his priests to be \"the lament of the lost as their essences flow out of them into the blood sea of battle.\" Garagos was usually half-naked and shunned the use of armor, though portrayed in religious art wearing a scarlet cloak said to be made from the blood of his enemies.",
        "Personality": "Garagos was a bloodthirsty and single-minded god with a love for violence and admiration for those that gave into merciless battle frenzy, destroying everything standing in their way. He himself was a practically elemental force of destruction, his mindless rage uncontrolled by nature, and in contrast to his short temper, he would take a long time to cool down from an emotional boil. While he shunned the use of armor, he did not prohibit his believers from wearing them. In older times, Garagos was more composed and less likely to burst into violence, but his loss at the hands of Tempus saw his fuse shorten and his new self was utterly devoid of the craftiness he once had.\n\nJust as Garagos had lost his wiliness, so too had he lost any sense of lenience of restraint when he was caught up in the heat of battle. While still [[chaotic neutral]], the debased and insane deity teetered on the brink of evil. Some claimed that his heart had hardened because he had lost all hope for attaining his secret love, but this idea was dismissed by others who themselves speculated that this was just the logical conclusion of the course he was on, and that he was finally going over the edge to outright evil he had long been standing on the brink of.",
        "Activities": "When Garagos manifested his avatar, legends said he wandered [[Godswalk Keep]] in the [[Barony of Great Oak]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]], killing every creature he could find. There, he railed against the manifestations of [[Jergal]] and [[Sharess]], whom he could not harm. His vehement frustration during these times, known to sages as the [[Meeting of the Three]], spawned a different name for the event: the Howling.<ref name=P111-7\">{{Cite polyhedron/111/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Black Saddle, Great Oak, and Bedorn, and then a break|7}}",
        "Relationships": "Garagos was the only enemy of [[Tempus]] whom the latter actually acknowledged. When he was merely a young [[demigod]], Tempus managed to defeat Garagos, purportedly winning a century long battle by using the Reaver's own berserker fury against him and taking the position of the god of war as the spoils from their duel. Garagos still harbored deep resentment towards Tempus over this, but unless his destructive abilities could someday surpass his tactical weakness, he would suffer if they met on the battlefield.\n\nFor some reason Garagos was still tolerated by Tempus and allowed to dwell in [[Warrior's Rest]] despite being hostile to everyone else there. Some sages speculated that Tempus kept Garagos around to act as bait, preferring to let the Bloodreaver lure out potential challengers. Others, meanwhile, suggested that there was one aspect of war that even Tempus found personally distasteful, the rabid rage of a mindless, murderous frenzy, and that he deliberately left it behind with Garagos when he became Faerun's main god of war.\n\nThe [[Red Knight]] disliked Garagos based on what Tempus had told her of him, but the two never personally came to blows. Garagos had resentment against her, the catspaw of Tempus. Some said that Tempus had uplifted the pragmatic and strategic goddess so that she could to act as his natural counterbalance.\n\nDuring the age of [[Netheril]], '''The Reaver''' as Targus the god of war had allied with [[Shar]] and was an enemy to [[Moander]].",
        "Symbol": "The symbol of '''The Reaver''', a counterclockwise circle of five arms clutching swords or a pinwheel of five blacken snaky arms spinning counterclockwise with each arm ending in an identical sword, was known as the [[Tentacus]] amongst his followers. It was also realized as a piercing, sharp [[:Category:Thrown weapons|thrown weapon]]. Garagathans may have belt buckles or cloak pins fashioned in the shape of the tentacus or even bear daggerlike belt weapons sporting a basket hilt in the shape of a whirlwind of five blades. Most clergy of '''Garagos''' carried a tentacus as a symbol of their faith and were skilled in its use as a weapon.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Orders": "* [[Bloodreaver|Bloodreavers]]: Specialty [[Cleric|priests]] of Garagos. Both weapons masters and clerics in one Garagathan, they were immune to ''[[command]]'' and [[Enchantment|enchantments]]. They also could fight like a [[berserker]] and even fight against the faithful of Tempus.\n* [[Brothers of Blood]]: [[Crusader|Crusaders]] of Garagos. They were dedicated to crushing '''The Reaver's''' enemies and have a tendency to fight the faithful of Tempus, both leading to short and bloody lives.\n* [[Brothers of Steel and Honor]]: Military units who served Garagos as a collective alliance, when '''The Reaver''' was Targus."

        "History": "During the age of [[Myth Drannor]], the war god was worshipped in [[Westgate]] and the [[Vilhon Reach|Vilhon]]. During the age of [[Netheril: Empire of Magic|Netheril]], Garagos, known then as Targus, was the [[Netherese pantheon]] god of war and victory over beasts, especially [[Dragon|dragons]]. His largest Netherese temple was the [[Temple of Targus]] in [[Akintaer]], an [[Netherese enclave]] devoted to Targan worship. Some time around or shortly after the fall of Netheril, the interloper deity Tempus managed to slay Garagos. Survived by die-hard followers in several regions surrounding the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and a church in [[Westgate]], Garagos mysteriously and unexpectedly reappeared in Westgate's harbor during the [[Time of Troubles]]. Much quicker to anger and slower to show mercy than he was before his death, Garagos found most of his followers in brigands, bandits, and priests of the [[Deities of Fury]] who paid him lip service in battle.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Garagos appeared personally to slay a [[marilith]] named [[Glackzana]] who was building a temple to herself in his guise in [[Gosra]], located in the Fields of Nun of central [[Chondath]]. He ordered this temple to be reconstructed in a more grand manner and rededicated to his worship. The Spellplague forced him to become an [[Exarch]] of Tempus to survive. He also changed [[alignment]] from [[Chaotic neutral|Chaotic Neutral]] to [[Chaotic evil|Chaotic Evil]].",
        "Rumors and Legends": "In legend, '''Garagos''' was the primary god of war across western [[Faerûn]] during the age of Netheril."
