==Powers==
After the [[Spellplague]], a divine caster with the Justice domain would become more insightful. In addition, when they used certain offensive powers and hit a target enemy, all wounded allies nearby would attack more accurately. These powers were ''[[bond of censure]]'' (for [[avenger]]s), ''[[mantle of the infidel]]'' (for [[Divine soul|invokers]]), ''[[righteous brand]]'' (for [[cleric]]s), and ''[[virtuous strike]]'' (for [[paladin]]s).

==Channel Divinity==
After the Spellplague, the divine caster could [[channel divinity]] to use ''[[immediate justice]]'', which was meant to enforce balance. They fired a flare of divine energy at an enemy who had brought an ally to the point of passing out or worse, lancing them with radiant energies.
