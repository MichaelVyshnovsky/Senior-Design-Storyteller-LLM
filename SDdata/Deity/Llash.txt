Llash was an obscure snake deity of poisons worshiped on Toril.
The deity was worshiped by serpentine creatures like nagas.
Idols of Llash were made out of black marble and resembled a cubic snake with three heads and crowned with a top-heavy cube. Each side of the cube had a carved ophidian face.
Llash was known of by some paladins of the Realms, such as Corran DArcey, a paladin of Tyr.
In 1369 DR, a group of dark naga worshipers of Llash infested and desecrated the ruined shrine of Mystra in the City of Song, Myth Drannor. The spine was under the protection of Anorrweyn Evensong, a follower of the Lady of Mystery who perished in the Weeping War but returned as a ghost, serving her goddess in death as she did in life. The nagas covered the holy symbol of Mystra with the image of their snake god, drawn in crude black paint. The nagas—Kog, Skerndli and Gorgat—were powered by one of pool of radiances spawn pools that fed on their evil worship. The nagas were slain by the heroes known as the Veiled Ones. With their death and the destruction of the idol, Llashs name and symbols that were painted over the shrine dissolved, freeing the ghost from the gods dark influence.
