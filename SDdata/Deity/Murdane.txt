'''Murdane''' was a deceased [[lesser deity]] of pragmatism and reason.

==Description==
Images of the goddess showed her with a long ponytail of rich reddish-black hair.

==Symbol==
Murdane's [[holy symbol]] was a collection of three gears with interlocked teeth, viewed side-on and colored black over a golden field. The uppermost wheel was largest, the middle wheel was medium-sized, and the bottom wheel was smallest, forming an overall chevron-like shape.

In addition, a lock of hair of the same red-black hue was commonly used as a touchstone or keepsake for worship of Murdane or as an aid when working on a problem.

==Relationships==
She was the lover of [[Helm]] the Watcher, god of guardians.

==History==
During the divine event known as the [[Dawn Cataclysm]], [[Lathander]] the Morninglord set into motion events that indirectly led to the death of Murdane.

This event was linked to the destruction of the empire of [[Jhaamdath]] beneath an enormous tsunami in the [[-255 DR|Year of Furious Waves, â€“255 DR]]. However, cause and effect were unclear; whether Jhaamdath's flooding led to or was caused by Murdane's drowning was unknown.This suggests that Murdane was heavily worshiped in Jhaamdath, and perhaps even a member of the [[Jhaamdathan pantheon]]. However, [[Auppenser]], who is heavily linked to and worshiped in Jhaamdath, is called the Lord of Reason. This suggests some overlap or close relationship between Murdane and Auppenser.

This caused Helm the Vigilant One to view Lathander with ill will thereafter.

==Worshipers==
Even as late as the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some sages still venerated Murdane, considering her the greatest practitioner of logic and deduction, able to learn everything about a person from the minutest clues.{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-12-24 - Murdane}}
