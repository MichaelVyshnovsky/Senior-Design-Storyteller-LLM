        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Moander appeared to his worshipers in an intangible image of a red-eyed giant rotting male [[humanoid]] head that sprouted {{SI|20'|'\"|long=yes}} long tendrils instead of hair and had a maw filled with fangs. This manifestation allowed Moander to communicate, manipulate objects with the tendrils, and create a mental link with the individuals the deity touched with the tentacles. The link remained even after the contact was broken, and the dark god continued whispering in the individuals' minds until the effects were negated via ''[[remove curse]]'' or ''[[remove disease]]'' spells.\n\nAs the god of decay, Moander could manifest through any type of rot. The deity created long tentacles of rotting matter that sprouted from the spots of decay. Each tendril was {{SI|20'|'\"|long=yes}} long and could freely manifest and move from one stop of rot to the next, within reach. These putrid tentacles could slam at the god's enemies and implant immobilized or sleeping creatures with the ''[[seed of Moander]].'' These tendrils could feed on decaying matter, and after devouring enough, they sprouted a bulb that matured into another independent tendril. These manifestations died and disintegrated when left without food after one-to-eight months."
        },
        "Personality": "The Darkbringer was a cruel deity who reveled in controlling its subjects. The tyrant delighted in the torment and destruction of lesser beings; it sought to force mortals' hands to ruin those they held dear. Moander sought to corrupt anyone who refused to bow down to it. The Jawed God used lies and half-truths to cause emotional distress to those it tortured.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Moander's pseudopods.png|thumb|''Moander's pseudopods spilling out of an [[Abyss]]al [[dimensional door]].''|313x313px]]\nIn his Abomination avatar shape, Moander was unable to cast spells. However, that was compensated by the sheer power and resilience of the creature. The rotting hulk could freely move across vertical surfaces or float on water. The entirety of its putrid mass could sprout tendrils, eyes, or mouths to communicate or to land devastating attacks on its enemies. Despite being an easy target, the Abomination of Moander had thick natural defenses, absorbing most attacks into its rotting mass. The Abomination had to be created by the hands of its servants, and the decaying mass that became the vessel of the Jawed God had to be at least {{SI|30'|'\"|long=yes}} in diameter. The Abomination needed to continuously absorb organic matter in order to grow or simply exist. If left without access to new matter, the Abomination eventually rotted away within one to four months and turned to dust and foul slime. The Abomination's main mode of attack was via tendril slams and sprouting a massive fanged maw that devoured all who stood in front of the avatar. Moander's rotting body also often used huge tree trunks as [[spear]]-like projectiles or ''[[entangle]]d'' its enemies. The avatar could also implant the ''seed of Moander'' into captured living creatures, taking full control over them.\n\nThose who were unlucky enough to be swallowed by the Abomination were crushed as endless tendrils rotted away their equipment and clothes, eventually killing them and adding the carcasses to Moander's avatar. Some who survived within the creature could be infected with the ''seed of Moander''. The deity gained knowledge of all those \"blessed\" with the ''seed''. That connection worked both ways, granting the victims a brief look into the god's mind. Moander could cast any spells it knew through any of the ''seeded'' victims. Each enslaved victim shared their mind with the deity, making the Abomination permanently smarter and wiser.\n\nThis avatar was vulnerable to fire due to flammable gasses and fumes that the giant carcass constantly produced. Smaller sources of magical or mundane flames could damage the creature very little and were quickly snuffed out by the Abomination's wet oozing body. Bigger sources of flame, such as dragon's breath, could detonate the Abomination, instantly destroying the avatar in a colossal blaze. The cold was harmful to it, damaging it and halting the rotting.\n\nMoander's core could move between piles of filth of big enough size through exuding a relatively small flying egg-shaped pod. These pods contained the essence of Moander and allowed it to possess another rotting body, creating a new Abomination. Given enough putrefied matter, the Jawed God's avatar could vomit a shambling mound twice per day and a gibbering mouther once every three days. These spawns were under the god's control for the one-to-twelve following days. After that, the creatures were granted autonomy and they wandered away from the creator. Lastly, the Abomination could open a ''[[gate]]'' at will, sacrificing about a month's worth of rot that sustained it.\n\nDuring cold months, the Abomination of Moander retreated to warm lands or into lava-filled hot cavers of the [[Underdark]], where it was fed and guarded by the dread god's clergy.",
        "Divine Realm": "Moander's [[divine realm]]–[[Offalmound]], was located in [[Rarandreth]], the 223{{rd}} [[abyss]]al layer, both in the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]] and the [[World Tree cosmology]]. Adherents of the latter worldview speculated that with the deity's demise his realm was either pushed outside the [[Astral Plane#Astral Plane in the World Tree Model|Astral Plane]] without any connections remaining or collapsed altogether.",
        "Relationships": "Moander especially reveled in corrupting, enslaving, and rotting [[beholder]]s and similar creatures. Sages thought that to be tied to ancient rivalry with fellow god [[Bane]], Another ancient enemy of Moander's was [[Tyranthraxus]] the Possessing Spirit, who, in the days of antiquity, attempted to take over the Jawed God's hold in the Realms.\n\nAmong gods, Moander had several allies and significantly more foes. Unlike [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Lolth]] was an enemy of Moander who lusted after its portfolio. Many of the [[elf|elven]] pantheon opposed dark gods, putting them at odds with Moander. This included [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Hanali Celanil]] [[Rillifane Rallathil]], and [[Solonor Thelandira]]. The [[halfling]] deities [[Arvoreen]] and [[Sheela Peryroyl]] considered Moander their deadly foe.\n\nThe Darkbringer gained many bitter rivals among the gods of Netheril, the feuds that lasted for millennia. These ancient foes included [[Jannath]]–an aspect of [[Chauntea]], [[Jergal]], [[Mystryl]]–the goddess of magic,, [[Selûne]], [[Targus]]–aspect of [[Garagos]], and the goddess of luck [[Tyche]], who eventually fell by the Darkbringer's scheme. However, Moander made allies of [[Kozah]]–ancient aspect of [[Talos]], with whom, Moander sought to destroy anything that Mystryl had a hand in creating.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Non-Human Worshipers": "Moander was served by and could manifest itself as several intelligent non-human creatures, such as [[algoid]]s, [[dark tree]]s, gibbering mouthers, shambling mounds, and [[vegepygmies]] created by [[russet mold]]. for their nefarious purposes, and the deity summoned its loyal [[Black dragon|black]] or [[green dragon]]s to serve the [[Mouth of Moander]]. The Jawed God's hate of beholders led to the deity transforming dead enslaved aberrations into rotting [[death tyrant]]s, fully subservient to it. In the late-14{{th}} century DR, Moander received worship from some of [[wild elves]] who stood in fear of encroaching civilization. These elves believed that the god of decay could protect them from farmers, ranchers, and loggers.",
            "Places of Worship": "Typical temples of the Rotting God were constructed as sprawling underground complexes or atop sharp hills away from prying eyes in the secluded wilderness. The temples were marked by circled of sharp fang-shaped rocks arranged in the shape of Moander's open jaws, surrounding an altar. The underground temples could be found in places with rot, waste, and decaying sewage. The temple complexes' walls were carved with delicate images of elves frowning [[tree]]s, tortured [[humanoid]]s, and people being melted by dragons' [[acid]].\n\nThe oldest place of Moanderite worship in [[Faerûn]] was an underground temple known as the [[Abyss of the Abomination]], in the city of [[Yûlash]] in the [[Moonsea]] region. The temple complex was over 1,000 years old by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. More obscure places of worship were mere rumors to most. The forests outside of [[Ylraphon]] were rumored to shelter shrines of several evil powers, including the worship site called the [[House of Moander]]. Another temple of Moander could be found proudly standing in the City of a Thousand Temples–[[Bezantur]] in [[Thay]]. Following the Jawed God's death during the [[Time of Troubles]], the main well-hidden active place of worship was the [[Hidden Glades]] temple by the town of [[Torsch]] in [[Chondalwood]]. The faith was led by the Mouth of Moander [[Dalchatha Maereegh]]. She ran a wide spy network and guided cultists to capture, slay, and rot enemies of the church, turning them into new bodies for Moander to turn into Abominations.",
            "Holy Days": "Cultists of Moander were expected to perform a daily ceremonial kill of a creature or gather vegetation to spread rot and decay. [[Balefire]] was one of the very few celebrations of the god's worshipers. It took place on the first of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] when Moanderites constructed huge bonfires in the name of the god of rot to hold back the cold."

        "History": {
            "Supposed Death": "Moander attempted a return to power in the Realms in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. The deity tracked down the [[saurial]] tribe Dragonbait hailed from and transported them as his slaves into a remote location within the [[Dalelands]] – [[Tarkhaldale]]. The demipower implanted the ''seed of Moander'' into [[Coral (saurial)|Coral]], an old flame and mate of Dragonbait's, turning her into the Mouth of Moander, the High Priest of the Rotting God. Reestablished on the [[Prime Material plane]], Moander infected a powerful [[beholder]] [[Xaran]], a [[Harper]] agent [[Kyre]], and an army of [[treant]]s. The Darkbringer's slave saurials were tasked with growing a pile of rot to become a new Abomination, defiling all living things in the Lost Vale, and adding their own eggs to the dreaded god's body. In the advent of the [[Time of Troubles]], Alias, Dragonbait, [[Finder Wyvernspur]]– Alias's creator and father, confronted the saurial colony and Moander. Dragonbait was forced to kill his old love Coral as there was nothing left of her but rotting vines on the inside. Finder Wyvernspur and Akabar Bel Akash followed the god into the [[Abyss]] and sacrificed their lives, destroying the Darkbringer with a shard of [[para-elemental ice]] that powered ''[[Finder's Stone]]''. Finder inherited Moander's divinity, with sponsorship from Moander's enemies, goddess of luck [[Tymora]] and the [[House Wyvernspur]] patron goddess [[Selûne]], and became a demigod in his own right.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|6}}\n\n[[File:Moander dead.jpg|thumb|''One of the shards of The Jawed God, floating in the [[Astral Sea]].''|360x360px]]\nSages debated how true was Moander's destruction. His avatars were gone, and his existence in the Abyss was cut short by a mortal with heat from the divine. Some claimed to have encountered Moander's body floating in the [[Astral Plane]], and there was evidence of a fraction of the Darkbringer's essence growing in power in the planes. This was met with different degrees of success. Clerics of [[Cyric]] ventured there to relish the dark energy there while [[drow]] following [[Vhaeraun]] wanted to have nothing to do with the place.\n\nMeanwhile, the worship of Moander became splintered between cultists who followed the Jawed God and those who embraced a new religion dedicated to rot and corruption. The [[drow]] deity [[Lolth]] felt vulnerable after the [[Godswar]] and quickly seized the opportunity to claim Moander's name as her aspect in the surface world and the Rotting God's hegemony, unclaimed by Finder. Under Moander's guise, Lolth attracted surface humans, elves, and [[half-elves]] who found rot and corruption more appealing and comprehensible than Lolth's dogma among the drow.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, strange fog started appearing in the [[High Forest]]. All living beings who found themselves within the roaming clouds were turned into rotting [[mummies]] adorned with Moander's ''holy symbol.'' During the same period of time, a band of Moanderite cultists uncovered ancient, powerful Netherese magics and attempted to use them to rob Finder Wyvernspur of his divine spark in order to return Moander to Toril. The attempt, evidently, was unsuccessful.",
            "Return to Toril": "{{fq\n| text = Question not the words of Moander, lest you be stricken by the Eating From Within. Go forth and possess beings of power and influence for me.

        "Rumors & Legends": "*[[Brindul Alley]] in [[Waterdeep]] was haunted by a strange ''[[Hand That Sings|flying hand]]'' that greatly resembled the ''holy symbol'' of Moander. There were many theories of the hand's origin. However, none were confirmed.\n*[[Citadel of Fungi]] in the vicinity of Moander's Road was known for copious amounts of yellow-green mold and fungus in the 15{{th}} century DR. The ancient citadel's treasures remained un-plundered as locals whispered of Moander's influence spreading from the long-killed Abomination, rotting underneath a hill.\n*Many rumors about gods circulated among mortals. The most salacious were stories of Mystra's divine lovers. There have been claims of [[Azuth]], [[Helm]], [[Shar]], [[Bane]], Moander, or the nearest rock to consort with the goddess of magic.
