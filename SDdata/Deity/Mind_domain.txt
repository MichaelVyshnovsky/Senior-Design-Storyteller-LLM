Not to be confused with the Mentalism domain, the Mind domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers involving the mind.
The priest gained skill in diplomacy, deception, and in sensing the motives and deception of others.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the comprehend languages, detect thoughts, and lesser telepathic bond spells. Clerics of some experience could cast discern lies, telepathic bond, and probe thoughts. Those that were masters of this domain had access to brain spider, mind blank, and weird.
