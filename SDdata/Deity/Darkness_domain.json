        "mainbody": "'''Darkness domain''' was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and other powers related to darkness.",
        "Deities": "{{ListDeitiesByDomain|{{PAGENAME}}}}",
        "Powers": "A priest with the Darkness domain could move and fight with relative ease while blind or in utter darkness, and could defend themselves normally against those who attacked from concealment.",
        "Spells": "Two suites of spells were known in this domain.\n\nIn one, as they advanced, a priest could shroud an area in ''[[obscuring mist]]'' or ''[[blacklight]]''. They could protect themselves with ''[[armor of darkness]]'' or damage a foe from afar with ''[[darkbolt]]s''. To scout around, they could summon floating ''[[prying eyes]]''. They could also strike a victim with ''[[blindness or deafness]]'' or a ''[[Nightmare (spell)|nightmare]]'', and even utter a word of power to outright ''[[Power word, blind|blind]]'' or ''[[Power word, kill|kill]]'' them.\n\nIn the other, a priest could instead shroud an area in ''[[deeper darkness]]'', a ''[[damning darkness]]'' that harmed those within, and ultimately a great ''[[Utterdark (spell)|utterdark]]'' that the evil could see through and a ''[[screen]]'' against sight and [[Scry|scrying]]. Lesser priests could use ''[[Darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]'' to see in the dark and they could also fire ''darkbolts''. Later, they could conjure ''[[Evard's black tentacles|black tentacles]]'' to grasp at foes and an opaque black ''[[wall of force]]'' to block movement. Such a priest could also travel great distances with ''[[shadow walk]]''."
