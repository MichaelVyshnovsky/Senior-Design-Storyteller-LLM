        "mainbody": "alibela, also known as St. Lalibela, was a minor goddessAlthough said to be a \"demigoddess of the nixies\" in The Mines of Bloodstone, the description and power of Lalibela there is closer to that of a nymph. In The Throne of Bloodstone, she is renamed \"St. Lalibela\". Like St. Dionysus and St. Sollars, also introduced in the Bloodstone Pass series, it may be that she is a saint of Ilmater. This also fits with Gareth being a paladin of Ilmater.\nLalibela possessed incredible beauty and went naked.\nThe very sight of Lalibela unclothed could strike a mortal male dead except those she chose. And, unfortunately for everyone else, she didnt wear clothes.\nAnyone who attacked her would suffer the blow themselves.\nThe sword Crusader could be used to commune with Lalibela.\nIn the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, at a small, crystal-clear subterranean lake in the Deepearth region of the Underdark beneath Damara, Lalibela appeared to the paladin Gareth Dragonsbane, believing him to be of pure heart. Via telepathy, she bade him set aside his armor, weapons, and equipment, and walk across the lake. Rising out of the lake, she granted him the magic sword Crusader but spirited away his other weapons and tools before she sank back beneath the water. The weapon would be a great boon in his battles against demons, but if its wielder ever showed cowardice against them, it would return to Lalibela.The \"Lady of the Lake\" scene in The Mines of Bloodstone (based on the Lady of the Lake character of Arthurian myth) is an optional event for paladins. Later adventures and The Bloodstone Lands give Gareth Crusader, implying this event happened the same way for him."
