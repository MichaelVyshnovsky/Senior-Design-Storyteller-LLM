''The Book of Chaos'' within the ''[[Planes of Chaos (boxed set)|Planes of Chaos]]'' boxed set even states that Hod the Blind had been exiled from Asgard because of the Norns foreseeing his killing of Balder. In ''Desert of Desolation'' the story of Balder's death is discussed as though it had long since already occurred, though it also refers to the Norns as standing to protect his fate and features an enigmatic figure claiming to be Balder.",
        "Description": "Balder was renowned for his otherworldly beauty, with the other Norse powers believing it rivaled that of all the other known deities of beauty, even that of the goddess [[Sune]], though it wasn't certain how honest this opinion was. Fittingly, the [[avatar]]s of Balder took the form of handsome [[fighter]]s, often accompanied by an entourage of one or more hundred women.",
        "Personality": "Balder was said by some to have wisdom that matched his beauty, that he would never fail to fulfill obligations from his pantheon, or wasn't vain, with some noting that he practiced very exacting standards when it came to who among the [[petitioner]]s he allowed to reside within his divine hall.",
        "Abilities": "Balder was a warrior of considerable skill he had dreams that were prophetic to some degree, Only weapons that had mistletoe within them could do any harm to his body.\n\nHis senses of hearing, sight, smell, and touch extended out as far as {{SI|14|mile|long=yes}}. Like other deities he could perceive anything occurring within {{SI|15|mile}} of his worshipers, objects and sites sacred to him, or any location where his name or one of his many titles had been spoken within the prior hour. He could divide his senses between up to ten such places at a time. And being a god of beauty, he could also sense anything involving objects of beauty and discussions about beauty or comparing the beauty of things, the instant it occurred and could retain that information for up fourteen weeks.\n\nBalder was also skilled in appraisal and crafting. He could create magical [[instruments]] and magical versions of the tools and supplies used by artists. The market value of such items never exceeded 200,000 [[gold piece]]s.\n\nBalder had a wide variety of spell-like abilities that his avatar form could cast, derived from his [[divine domain]]s. These included the following:\n: ''[[aid]]'', ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance]]'', ''[[cure critical wounds]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[detect secret doors]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[discern location]]'', ''[[dispel evil]]'', ''[[divination]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[foresight]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[healing circle]]'', ''[[holy aura]]'', ''[[holy smite]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', ''[[magic circle against evil]]'', ''[[mass heal]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[regenerate]]'', ''[[summon monster IX]]'' (as [[good]] only), ''[[true resurrection]]'', and ''[[true seeing]]''..\n\nHis avatars also had access to a wide variety of bardic spells. These included the following:\n: ''[[blindness/deafness]]'', ''[[blink]]'', ''[[break enchantment]]'', ''[[bull's strength]]'', ''[[cat's grace]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[daze]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[dismissal]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[dream]]'', ''[[expeditious retreat]]'', ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[greater dispelling]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[healing circle]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', ''[[mage armor]]'', ''[[mass haste]]'', ''[[mirage arcana]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[modify memory]]'', ''[[persistent image]]'', ''[[prestidigitation]]'', ''[[project image]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'', ''[[sculpt sound]]'', and ''[[shatter]]''.<ref>",
        "Possessions": "The avatars of Balder carried some sort of [[sword]], typically a ''+5 [[greatsword]]'' that carried the [[weapon qualities]] ''[[Bane (property)|bane]]'' (against [[evil]] [[outsider]]s), ''[[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]]'', and ''[[keen]]''.",
        "History": "Balder was born to the Norse gods [[Frigga]] and [[Odin]], alongside a blind twin brother that was named [[Hod]]. He led a relatively idyllic young life, being dotted upon by his parents, until one night he started being plagued by ominous dreams of his death yet to come and confided in those dreams to his mother. Frigga, who normally tried to not intervene in the future,<ref> either of her own volition or at the urgings of the rest of her concerned pantheon, went out and beseeched all things in creation, both animate and inanimate, to pledge that they would never harm him. Frigga was rather successful in this undertaking, though overlooked the plant known as mistletoe, believing it was far too weak to ever pose a threat to Balder. From then on Balder's body was impervious to harm and the Norse gods greatly delighted in his newfound power, often hosting contests where they would try bouncing weapons off his chest to amuse themselves, such as [[axe]]s or [[spear]]s.\n\nEventually he married a goddess by the name of Nanna and with her produced a son that they named Forseti.\n\nTo Balder's misfortune, there was one among the Norse gods who did not delight in him, but rather sought to take his life Undeterred by this, Loki continued plotting Balder's death, still focused on the idea of a spear of mistletoe.\n\nAccording to some sources, Balder's prophesied death could not be prevented, as Loki ultimately managed to achieve his goals  by having Hod the Blind throw a different weapon made out of mistletoe. Depending upon the source, this weapon was either a sharpened [[dart]] or a [[wand]], and Loki had guided Hod's hands so that it would land squarely in Balder's heart.\n\nSome centuries prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], in the kingdom of [[Bakar]], a survivor state of the [[Imaskar Empire]],<ref> a mighty city known as [[Medinat Muskawoon]] housed temples to gods of faiths that the populace's ancestors brought over from their original worlds. Among these temples was one dedicated to Balder, known simply as the [[Temple of Balder]], though those who worshiped him in the city believed Balder to possibly be dead, slain by a wand of mistletoe. In front of his temple stood a semi-circle of stones, a shrine dedicated to the Norns. It was magically warded to keep out all wooden objects, especially mistletoe, and was meant to act as protection for Balder against fate and all who would seek to do him harm. \n\nWhen a group of [[adventurer]]s explored the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, the Norns appeared before them at their shrine and asked the adventurers a set of three questions  &ndash; \"What is your family?\", \"What do you seek in this city?\", and \"What do you wish from us?\"  The adventurers answered them swiftly and truthfully, confessing that they were there in search of the ''[[Star of Mo-Pelar]]''. Satisfied, the Norns provided them information and allowed them to pass. Inside the temple they found a rather handsome human male seated on a black stone tablet, dressed in simple [[boots]], [[tunic]], and [[trouser]]s. Standing up to address them, he proclaimed himself to be the \"unlucky Balder, friend to all he knows. Those of you who would weep for him, hold forth your hand.\" Those who did found a tear-drop of [[amber]] appear in their palms before the mysterious figure vanished.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"N2\">As ''Desert of Desolation'' was adapted to the Realms using [[Ed Greenwood]]'s first materials sent over to [[TSR]], it is taken to predate the rest of the 1{{st}} edition products, which were set in [[1357 DR]], but to be set close enough in time that those would remain valid. Thus, the date of 1356 DR is chosen.",
        "Realm": "Balder lived alongside his wife Nanna in the realm of [[Asgard]], within his own hall known as [[Breidablik]], or \"Broad Splendor\". It was believed by many to be one of the most beautiful godly halls in all of Asgard, comparable to the [[Civic Festhall|Gilded Hall]] of the [[Sensates]], though far more rowdier. Balder himself spent little time within the hall, often busying himself elsewhere. The hall was governed in his stead by three individuals, known as the Wise Councilors of Baldur, who each represented one of his core aspects &ndash; that of a handsome man, a warrior, and a sage.\n\nAs befitting Balder's holy symbol, the goblets in Breidablik were all encrusted with jewels. Usually these were gems of a lesser sort, such as [[agate]]s, [[mica]], or [[pyrite]].\n\nOnly the most beautiful of his petitioners were found here, with all others turned away. Like other Norse [[petitioner]]s they were prone to feats of valor, just as fast and strong as any other. Unlike their god, Balder's petitioners  were noted as being far more vain than other Norse petitioners. They also were the only militia in all of Ysgard to wear unmatching uniforms and they placed greater importance on battle magic, the latter of which was praised by the bards among them as making them more dangerous than other Norse petitioners. They commonly wore bright cloaks with [[gold]] stitching and wielded weapons that had gold inlays, the most common being blazing spears.",
        "Activities": "Balder spent much of his time away from the halls of Breidablik, attempting to woo other beautiful gods and bestowing gifts unto those who worshiped him. He was particularly known for rewarding unsightly individuals, who had demonstrated their worth through some sort of great self-sacrificial deed, by blessing them to be more charismatic. He also was known for to lend his [[horse]]s out on a whim to his champions when they went on quests.",
        "Relationships": "Balder was devoutly loyal to his father Odin and the rest of the [[Aesir]]. He in turn was greatly beloved by nearly all members of the Norse pantheon, with the exception of Loki. Many sought him as a traveling companion on their adventures and they paid close attention to what he told about his dreams. Outside of the Norse pantheon, most gods that met Balder were endeared towards him, with even those who normally weren't friendly towards [[human]]s managing to have good words to say about him. About the only powers that truly disliked him were those that represented hatred and plague.\n\nIn addition to being the twin brother of Hod, Balder was a sibling of Hermod and [[Tyr]].<ref> He was married to a member of the Aesir by the name of Nanna and with her had a son that they named Forseti.\n\nUnlike many deities, Baldur was served by no [[proxies]], as he felt he had no need for them.",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:Balder Symbol.jpg|thumb|273px|''The holy symbol of Balder, a gem-encrusted silver chalice.'']]\nBalder was honored on a number of worlds by bards \n\nThough a disproportionate number of those in his clergy were very beautiful or handsome individuals, it was not an actual requirement to become a priest. The clergy dressed rather simply, often wearing [[silver]] [[helmet]]s and [[chainmail]] for their priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the [[sphere]]s of [[All sphere|all]], [[charm sphere|charm]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[protection sphere|protection]], and [[summoning sphere|summoning]], as well as the [[domain]]s of [[good domain|good]], [[healing domain|healing]], and [[knowledge domain|knowledge]]. They also possessed a unique ability to ''charm'' members of the opposite [[Gender and sex|sex]] that gazed upon them.\n\nThe cult of Balder was divided into two facets, though like other faiths focused on Norse gods it preached acceptance of fate, though more so than others tried to laugh it off, and all clergy were expected to treat the less fortunate with both compassion and kindness. One sect of the cult focused on teaching others to grow closer to the gods by creating objects of beauty, claiming that doing so would help one to achieve a higher emotional and mental state of being.  This sect also believed the gods to be source of artistic inspiration and thus deserving of gratitude and respect. The other side of the cult of Balder was more focused on tragedy and rebirth, preaching that new opportunities and hope for the future always arose from adversity.\n\nLike most Norse temples, those dedicated to Balder were sturdy forts, though they were said to be the most beautiful and well-designed out of all Norse temples, being designed with each particular environment or location in mind. Each typically sported a small armory and a workshop or studio where the clergy could receive Balder's divine inspiration. They were often found in areas with high populations of gnomes, who adorned the temples with their gnomish artistry. The temples were also adorned in great carvings and paintings. Due to the circumstances of Balder's death, his temples banned all manner of weapons and wooden tools.\n\nSacrifices to Balder traditionally took place once a month and in the form of a crafted item. His holy days fell on full moons."
