        "mainbody": "Selvetarm (), known also as The Spider that Waits, Champion of Lolth or, despite being Vhaerauns son and thus her grandson, was the drow god of warriors and battle prowess. His church basically consisted of a military sub-division of Lolths church, In fact, the name associated with those followers of the Spider that Waits—Selvetargtlin—could be applied without problems to his entire clergy.\nWhen sending his avatar, Selvetarm appeared as a large spider, sometimes with the head of a male drow. He was known to wield a heavy mace, Venomace,  his favored weapon, in his right hand, and a longsword, Thalackvelve, in his left hand. He could cast spells from any sphere.\nSelvetarms manifestations were rare because he either ignored pleas or simply sent an avatar. Rare manifestations consisted of tiny sphere of utter darkness, that gradually grew to explode into a blade barrier. Selvetarm expressed his pleasure through the finding of rogue stones, dried silverbark or webstones. His servants included myrlochars, retrievers and other spiders.\nSelvetarm was a ruthless and violent deity, whose only interests consisted of war and spreading destruction. He couldnt find beauty in anything but lethal and efficient combat styles.\nHe hated everything, including Lolth, to whom he was practically enslaved. Despite this hatred, he was quite dutiful, as well as his freedom to protect her life.\nDespite his aggressive traits, he had the capability to be patient to conduct functional ambushes, but frontal wild clashes were his clear preference over anything that required planning and restraint.\nHe had once a rather uncertain personality, and embraced neither evil nor good. When he met his aunt, Eilistraee, he learned to appreciate her teachings, thus embracing goodness and beauty, but in the end Lolths trickery turned him into his war-crazed self.(see History)\nSelvetarm hated Lolth like everything else. He was bound to her will, Selvetarm himself felt quite comfortable in his subservient role.\nDrow scholars speculated Selvetarm was a tanarri lord who was elevated to the position of champion of Lolth during the Time of Troubles, in an attempt to draw male followers from the flocks of Ghaunadaur and Vhaeraun. Other scholars thought Selvetarm might merely be an aspect of Lolth.\nHe was Vhaerauns and Zandilar the Dancers son but he spurned both his parents, for his mind at that time was too uncertain to commit himself to one direction.\nAfter he became Lolths servant, father and son became enemies. For example, when Vhaeraun tried to bring the draegloths under his faith, Selvetarms reaction was to compete with the Masked Lord in that regard, with the goal to subsequently give his draegloths followers to Lolth, because he wanted to hinder his fathers goal to unseat his grandmother. and his submissiveness was a source of rage for the Masked Lord.\nAccording to rumors Vhaeraun was the one who granted spells to the priests who worshiped Selvetarm in his own right instead of Selvetarm or Lolth with the goal of instilling in them a sense of independence.\nHe was known to protect Garagos, who was thought to be opting to steal his powers.\nHe was also an ally of Kiaransalee, who was also in a subservient position to Lolth, in her case out of fear from the Spider Queens power.\nHe was also an enemy of Sharess, the goddess who absorbed Zandilar the Dancer, and thus was in a sense, his mother.\nAfter he was found by Eilistraee, they grew close to each other, until he turned into a bloodthirsty monster under Lolths command and her enemy.\nthumb|250px|A priest of Selvetarm in the churchs ceremonial garb.\nHis followers consisted of drow and aranea.\nAmong the drow, as mentioned before, Selvetarm was practically forgotten, and his faith was essentially part of Lolths church armed wing. His followers in his main center of worship—Eryndlyn—werent even allowed to worship him as a god on his own (rather than Lolths servant), as the church of Lolth persecuted anyone who did as a heretic. As a general rule, Selvetargtlins trained in martial combat. Practicing Selvetarms beliefs was somewhat of a career-killer in drow society, for these beliefs didnt put any meaningful emphasis on the intellectual part of combat (like strategy), and thus followers of Selvetarm were rarely put into commanding positions. The drow branch had a gender ratio of about 101 in favor of male drow.\nHis aranea followers were a different deal. When they talked about Selvetarm, they however referred to his aspect Zanassu. They put emphasis on craftiness, patience and subtlety.\nSelvetarm was the child of Vhaeraun and Zandilar the Dancer. The latter was a demigoddess of the elves in Yuirwood. When Lolths forces attacked the Yuirwood, Zandilar tried to seduce Vhaeraun into helping her, but was instead imprisoned to be drained of her strength. Bast saved Zandilar, who willingly merged with her savior (originating a new goddess Sharess), giving birth to Selvetarm during the process.\nSelvetarm rejected both parents for he was too uncertain to commit himself to one or the other philosophical direction. He wandered for a number of centuries, until he met Eilistraee and learnt to appreciate her goodness and to admire the Dark Dancer herself. Eilistraees teachings made him start to embrace the ways of good, and the she hoped that his redemption could improve the relationships between the drow and the Seldarine and their followers.\nDuring that time, Lolth had two problems. She saw a rival in the demon lord Zanassu, for he challeged her dominion over spiders, and she was not pleased with Eilistraee getting a friend within the Dark Seldarine. In order to solve her issues, she approached Selvetarm and tricked him into believing that killing Zanassu would have won him the gratitude of Eilistraee.\nThat promise was enough to lead Selvetarm to kill Zanassu, but he also absorbed the defeated demon lords essence in the process. That influence proved too strong for his personality, corrupting him and weakening him enough for Lolth to bind him to her will. The Spider Queen was therefore successful in her plan, and in creating a new enemy for her daughter.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Selvetarms avatar appeared in Eryndlyn. The avatar raged through the city and was driven back by a coalition of drow who didnt follow Lolth there, while the church of the Spider Queen hailed him as the swordarm of their goddess. This action gave him a small following in the city, but mostly as a military order belonging.\nthumb|left|216px|Selvetarm and his father, Vhaeraun, duel.\nIn the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, Lolth went into a state of hibernation, a period called the Silence of Lolth, for about a year. The goal was to transform herself into a greater deity and turn the Demonweb Pits into a realm independent from the Abyss.\nSelvetarm took the duty of protecting her while she was vulnerable while Vhaeraun nearly managed to kill his mother, the Champion of Lolth managed to save her life. The battle between the two gods caused some planar turmoils, as the edges of the various planes started to fray and bleed together.\nDuring the Silence, Vhaeraun also brought a number of draegloths under to his church. Selvetarm tried to get the draegloths himself to give them to Lolth.\nAfter Lolths awakening, Selvetarm took part to the ongoing conflict between Lolth and Eilistraee as the Spider Queens champion, ordering his Judicators to initiate a series of attacks against shrines and communities faithful to Eilistraee.\nOn Nightal 20, the , Selvetarm tried to strike at the heart of his aunts forces, as his followers attacked the Promenade of the Dark Maiden. However, his attempts ultimately failed on Nightal 20 of the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR, the defenders of the Promenade bested the assailants, This event later caused his church to be completely absorbed into Lolths. The Spider Queen claimed that Selvetarms loss was part of her plan, and Eilistraee too was led to believe it.\nDuring the 1480s DR, the Overgod Ao separated the twin worlds Abeir and Toril once again and rewrote the Tablets of Fate (an artifact which contained the name of every deity of the pantheon and their portfolio), in an event known as the Second Sundering. Because of that, many deities of Toril who were considered dead or lost managed to return to life, Selvetarm among them.\nThe Sword of Selvetarm was a holy sword, which Selvetarm created for his followers."
