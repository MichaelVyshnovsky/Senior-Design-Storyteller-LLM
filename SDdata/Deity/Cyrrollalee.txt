Cyrrollalee (Pronounce|SEER|oh|LAH|lee|refs=
Cyrrollalees avatar appeared as a brown-haired female halfling.
The Hearthkeeper was a caring deity who represented the home-life of halflings. As such, she was interested in hospitality and generosity, and frowned upon those who treated guests poorly. She particularly disdained those who burgled homes or betrayed the trust of hosts.
Cyrrollalees avatar was a skilled cleric, wizard, and paladin. She favored casting spells that aided others, such as those from the healing, guardian, and protection spheres.
Cyrrollalee  wielded a magical quarterstaff.
The Hand of Fellowship, as she was known, maintained several good relations with gods of both the halfling pantheon and others. However, she did not get along with evil deities, such as Abbathor, Cyric, and Urdlen. Her superior deity was Yondalla.

Cyrrollalee was worshiped by ordinary halflings, but especially homeowners and those interested in crafts such as textiles. Her worshipers were not evil, though if they were not goodly, they would still be lawful. Most of her worshipers were female clerics and mystics.
