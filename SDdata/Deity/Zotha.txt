'''Zotha''' was a godlike being who, according to the ''[[Book of the World]]'', existed at the beginning of time. 

==Description==
According to the few surviving accounts about Zotha, he was a huge [[manta ray]]-like being with a long tail.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-25 - Zotha Lore}}

==History==
According to the surviving tales about Zotha, he was one of the earlier creator [[god|deities]] that existed at the beginning of time. Unlike these other deities, Zotha was a strong-willed being who believed that not only his own creations but also the creations of all gods where his to play with and then devour.

Historically, according to [[sarrukh]] records, Asgorath actually cast down an "ice moon" or a comet to the surface of [[Abeir-Toril]] in an event known as the [[Tearfall]], wiping out the [[batrachi]] civilization and creating the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Some scholars from [[Candlekeep]] had the theory that this ice moon was one of the [[Tears of Sel√ªne]].

However, other tales passed down by elder [[dragon]]s, the priesthoods of other gods and the records of many sages, said that Asgorath attacked Zotha when he tried to devour Toril. Asgorath destroyed Zotha, rending him into small fragments that fell into Toril. Asgorath then ate some of these fragments so Zotha could not be reborn never again, but the rest of Zotha's fragments reached the [[Underdark]], where they became the predecessors of the [[mind flayer]]s, [[beholder]]s and similar races.
