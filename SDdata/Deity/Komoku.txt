'''Komoku''', the Wide Gazing, was a [[spirit]] who was guardian of western [[Wa]]. He was one of the [[Eight Million Gods]].{{Speculation}}

==Description==
He appeared as a powerful warrior clad in golden armor, wielding sword or spear and mounted upon a demonic steed.

==History==
Komoku ordered that a long silver cord be stretched across the [[Sea of Blossoms]], with one end tied to a tree on top of [[Mount Fo]] on [[Tsukishima]] and other end tied to a similar tree on top of [[Mount Chusa]] on [[Shidekima]]. This was to prevent the whole island of Shidekima from drifting away. Naturally enough, the trees were closely guarded.

==Shrines==
Komoku the Wide Gazing was venerated at the [[Shrine of the West Wind]] in [[Aru]]. The  {{SIAdj|25|ft|long=yes|adj=high}} statue of Komoku was made of wood and covered in a thin layer of beaten [[gold]]. Worshipers made offerings of flowers and origami.<ref>
