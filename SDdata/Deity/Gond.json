        "mainbody": "Gond ( ) and as Zionil in the Shining Lands, was the Faerûnian god of craft, smithing, and inventiveness. The Lord of All Smiths had many forms and names, and under all of them pushed for innovation and imaginativeness, sometimes to a dangerous degree, as a result of his short-sighted desire to create.\nGond was also known as Nebelun (\nAvatars of Gond took several forms, including that of a brawny, red-hued smith, a short, slight man with straw-blond hair, or a gnome. No matter his form, Gond had a forge-scarred face with dark (but nonetheless sharp and bright) eyes and a constantly attentive and inquisitive expression. He wore ordinary leathers under his scorched smith smock, though he could also summon a set of glassteel plate armor over himself (hovering close to his body piece by piece rather than actually encasing him) at will.\nGonds manifestations included a forge hammer wrapped with wisps of black smoke, or striking eyes set within dark clouds with the ringing sounds of hammers on anvils.\nThe divine personality of the Wonderbringer was as varied as his desire to innovate was intense. He would at times act wholly disciplined and methodical, while at others become easily distracted. He was just as often insightful and accommodating as he was sardonic or condescending.\nGond remained ever-concerned with making real any theoretical concept or schematic, and held little concern for any complications or problems that arose therefrom. He would readily accept commissions from any unscrupulous patron, so long as compensation was substantial and he was given opportunity to create novel and innovative devices.\nGond was not anti-magic as some may think, but viewed magic as simply another means by which to craft new inventions.\nThe god of invention posses immense strength and immunity to any firearms, or any weapon that had been crafting by means of smithing, forging or otherwise worked with tools made of metal. In fact any mundane metal weapon that struck Gonds form, immediately disintegrated.\nAt will, Gond could disjunct any nearby magical items.\nGond possessed a mighty Hammer of Thunderbolts called Craftmaster, that he used both as a tool at his divine forge and (if needed) as a weapon.\nGonds divine realm was the plane of Wonderhome, which manifested as a grand library in the House of Knowledge within the Outlands.\nAlong with Milil, Deneir, and Oghma, Gond was one of the Deities of Knowledge and Invention. He was on relatively good terms with Oghma, though sometimes their relationship could be tense, due to Gonds tendency to push new inventions being rapidly introduced across Faerûn without thinking of the consequences. Beyond the Deities of Knowledge and Invention, Gond was known to have a friendly rivalry with Chauntea, the Goddess of Bounty, and amiable relationships with Lathander, Waukeen,\nHe was a friend and ally to many other gods of craftsmanship and invention. He shared bonds with Cyrrollalee of the halfling pantheon, along with several of the Morndinsamman, including Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Vergadain, and even Moradin the All-Father. Gond shared an especially strong connection to the gnomish deity of smithing, Flandal Steelskin, who maintained a portal to Gonds divine realm.\nGond had one major foe among the Faerûnian deities, Talos the Destroyer.\nWhile Gond was wholly devoted to his mortal followers, he remained too busy at times to answer their prayers in a timely manner. To many this was seen as an appropriate means for Gondar priests to demonstrate their worthiness of his blessing.\nAt times, he would dispatch golems, lightning mephits, baku holy ones, einheriar, maruts, and even steel or crystal dragons to serve as guides to aid his devotees, or demonstrate his blessing to mortals.\nThe Wonderbringer constantly worked on new inventions. Gond was credited in legends for the creation of a number of artifacts. These included the Shadowstar and the unbreakable leash that bound Kezef the Chaos Hound.\nHe often spent time sparking inspiration in his most devout followers, or offering them new insights for how existing technology could be otherwise utilized.\nImageGondsymbol.png|The 15th century holy symbol of Gond (5e).\nImageGond symbol.jpg|The late-14th holy symbol of Gond (3e).\nUp until the late 14 century DR, the primary center of Gond worship in the realms was the island nation of Lantan.\nThe faith of Gond spread far and wide beyond the Sword Coast, to inland cities such as Tilverton in Cormyr, Essembra in the Dalelands, and Ravens Bluff in Vesperin. and among a community of gnomes that dwelled within a solitary isle within the Yal Tengri sea.\nGond was accepted among the gnomish pantheon as Nebelun the Meddler, though a few small groups believed that Nebelun was a separate deity. Though the latter was correct, Nebelun was only active in other crystal spheres, leaving the Faerûnian Lord of All Smiths free to take his place in the Realms.\n* Nadul DaRoni, a gnome hermit and inventor whose creations were regularly featured for sale in Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\n* Torlin Silvershield, High Artificer of Gond in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR.\n* Uthlan Abardreth, the patriarch of Gond in Chessenta.\n* Zelphar Thann, Count of Rivershire and Estate Chancellor of Tethyr.\nMain article CategoryTemples to Gond\nGond had various temples throughout Faerûn, such as the grand High House of Wonders in Baldurs Gate. Many temples to Gond were not just ordinary places of worship, but within, machines such as internal combustion engines were displayed, and vehicles such as gondrollers were sold.\nNotable temples to Gond included\n* High House of Wonders, the Baldurian holy house of Gond that served as an expansive testing grounds and laboratory for the citys Gondar priests.\n* High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration, a monastery in Illul on the isle of Lantan run by the High Artificer Danactar, Most Holy Servant of Gond.\n* House of Inspired Hands, one of the largest temples in Waterdeep led by High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind.\n* The Turning Wheel, a prosperous temple to the Wonderbringer found in Ravens Bluff.\nWorship of Gond as Zionel―among practitioners of the Adama―emerged several years pre-Dalereckoning, in the .\nDuring the Time of Troubles, in the , the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon were cast down to the mortal realms of Toril by the Overgod Ao. Gonds avatar took the form of a gnome who washed up on the shores of Lantan in the Trackless Sea. His divinity was quickly recognized by the Lantanna people and Gond was revered for the duration his avatar remained in the Realms.\nIn recognition and gratitude for their supplication, Gond bestowed upon the people of Lantan the secret for making smokepowder. This allowed the Lantanna to rapidly begin formulation of firearms, which were continually shipped off to purchasers across the western coast of Faerûn. While worship of Gond grew swiftly in the years that followed, the introduction of these new weapons was viewed as a foreboding change in warfare by leads from across Faerûn.\nA mere decade later, in the , Gond was commissioned by the recently-arisen god Cyric to commission powerful suits of armor to carry out his own schemes. Cyric armed his inquisitors with these horrific weapons of war and initiated the Second Banedeath in cities across the Heartlands."
