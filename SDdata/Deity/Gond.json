        "Personality": "The divine personality of the Wonderbringer was as varied as his desire to innovate was intense.

He would readily accept commissions from any unscrupulous patron, so long as compensation was substantial and he was given opportunity to create novel and innovative devices.\n\nGond was not anti-magic as some may think, but viewed magic as simply another means by which to craft new inventions.",

        "History": "Worship of Gond as Zionel―among practitioners of the [[Adama]]―emerged several years pre-[[Dalereckoning]], in the {{YearlinkName|-256}}.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon were cast down to the mortal realms of [[Toril]] by the Overgod [[Ao]]. Gond's avatar took the form of a [[gnome]] who washed up on the shores of Lantan in the [[Trackless Sea]]. His divinity was quickly recognized by the Lantanna people and Gond was revered for the duration his avatar remained in the Realms.\n\nIn recognition and gratitude for their supplication, Gond bestowed upon the people of Lantan the secret for making [[smokepowder]]. This allowed the Lantanna to rapidly begin formulation of firearms, which were continually shipped off to purchasers across the western coast of Faerûn. While worship of Gond grew swiftly in the years that followed, the introduction of these new weapons was viewed as a foreboding change in warfare by leads from across Faerûn.\n\nA mere decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Gond was commissioned by the recently-arisen god [[Cyric]] to commission powerful suits of armor to carry out his own schemes. Cyric armed his inquisitors with these horrific weapons of war and initiated the [[Second Banedeath]] in cities across the [[Heartlands]]."
