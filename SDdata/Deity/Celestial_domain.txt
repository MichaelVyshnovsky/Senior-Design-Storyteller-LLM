The Celestial domain was a clerical domain that granted celestial spells and powers.
* Domiel
* Pistis Sophia
The cleric gained the ability to smite evildoers once per day, as a paladin could.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the vision of heaven, consecrate, and blessed sight spells. Clerics of some experience could cast lesser planar ally, heavenly lightning, and call faithful servants. Those that were masters in this domain had access to heavenly lightning storm, holy aura, and gate.
