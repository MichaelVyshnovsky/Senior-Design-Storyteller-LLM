        "Personality": "Lynkhab experienced both desire and despair at the same time. She sought to die, but as an entity of pure will she could not die.",
        "Divine Realm": "She reigned over the 297{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 297: The Sighing Cliffs|the Sighing Cliffs]]. However, she also wandered the Abyss without fear because she could not die.",
        "Activities": "Lynkhab could and would forget herself for a time to force herself out of existence, but since she embodied desire she always returned after a few days. She was also known to seek out mortal adventurers in the Abyss in attempts to kill herself, but would kill the adventurers if they failed.",
