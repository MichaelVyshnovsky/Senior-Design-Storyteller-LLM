        "mainbody": "ynkhab was a tanarri demon lord titled the Lady of Regret who was associated with both desire and depression. She was a patron of the self-destructive.\nLynkhab was technically an entity of pure will, who continually reformed herself as to be the embodiment of desire. Most recently, she preferred to take the form of a voluptuous elf with fire-colored hair and eyes like burning ice. However, she also could see what a creature found desirable and change to match.\nLynkhab experienced both desire and despair at the same time. She sought to die, but as an entity of pure will she could not die.\nShe reigned over the 297 layer of the Abyss, the Sighing Cliffs. However, she also wandered the Abyss without fear because she could not die.\nLynkhab could and would forget herself for a time to force herself out of existence, but since she embodied desire she always returned after a few days. She was also known to seek out mortal adventurers in the Abyss in attempts to kill herself, but would kill the adventurers if they failed.\nLynkhab was once a major rival of Malcanthet, Shami-Amourae, and Xinivrae.\nLynkhab was one of the contenders for the title Queen of the Succubi, but lost to Malcanthet, Somehow, she came to express the idea of desire so completely that she became a disembodied creature, too incohesive to continue to gain power and change.\nAfter Shami-Amouraes release from the Wells of Darkness, she sought an alliance with both Lynkhab and Xinivrae, and there was some possibility that their combined forces could seriously threaten Malcanthet."
