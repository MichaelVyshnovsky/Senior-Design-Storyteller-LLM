        "mainbody": "engris was a Tuigan deity of the Sun.\nAccording to legends told by the Tuigan, Tengris was pursued by the moon goddess Becal after she scorned her nine suitors.\nIt was a custom among the nomadic people of the Hordelands to not dry clothes in the sun, believing that doing so would offend Tengris.In this passage the authors of The Horde only refer vaguely to a \"sun god\" without providing any name. As we know of no other major sun deities worshipped by the Tuigan, this can be assumed to be Tengris."
