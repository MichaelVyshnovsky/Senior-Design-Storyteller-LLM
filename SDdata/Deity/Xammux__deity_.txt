Xammux, also known as The Xammux or The Many,
The Xammux was said to be a composite of at least six separate beings.
Xammux was represented by a pair of shining and very sharp steel [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calipers calipers], and its shrines were likewise constructed of polished steel. The Xammux was said to favor a "long knife", which was also used by its worshipers.
Followers and clerics of Xammux were fascinated by knowledge and were entirely cold and uncaring in their pursuit of it. They were said to torture living creatures merely to see how much pain these test subjects could endure, or to dissect them merely to satisfy a simple curiosity about biology. Temples to the Xammux tended to be spartan stone structures decorated only in white plaster, with sacrificial altars that looked like steel examination tables. These buildings were also said to be protected with numerous ingenious locks and traps.
As of the late 15 century DR, cultists attempting to make contact with The Xammux were drawn to a flooded cave complex known as Xammux located between the High Forest and the Nether Mountains. There, they inscribed "Xammux" and "The Many" on the stone door at the dungeons entrance, and their activities attracted the attention of the locals. In truth, this locations name was not a reference to the Xammux,  but was a corruption of the ancient Netherese name "Tarchamus", although this was unknown even to the cultists.While references to The Xammux are indirect in both the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide and Lesser Evils, author of the latter Erin M. Evans confirmed in a [https//web.archive.org/web/20220502032053/https//twitter.com/erinmevans/status/1520966433429069824 tweet] that the cultists mentioned in the book are indeed followers of Xammux "[Xammux] was a location indicated on a 4e map as a site frequented by cultists of Xammux. I figured the mistranslation of Tarchamus led them to use the cavern and whether they successfully contacted any elder evils is someone elseâ€™s story."
