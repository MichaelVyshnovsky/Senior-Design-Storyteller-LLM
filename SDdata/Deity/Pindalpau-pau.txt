Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother was a totem spirit worshiped by the Ice Hunters.
It was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped her to eat reindeer meat or fat, wear anything made from reindeer, or otherwise harm a reindeer. However, those shamans that worshiped her could call upon the horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves once each day, summon reindeer to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a reindeer twice each tenday.
Additionally, iceguardians who revered the Reindeer Mother alongside Ulutiu also could call upon the horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves once each day.
