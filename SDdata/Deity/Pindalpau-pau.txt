'''Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother''' was a totem spirit worshiped by the [[Ice Hunters]].

It was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped her to eat [[reindeer]] meat or fat, wear anything made from reindeer, or otherwise harm a reindeer. However, those shamans that worshiped her could call upon the ''[[horns of wisdom]]'' or ''[[reindeer hooves]]'' once each day, summon [[reindeer]] to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a reindeer twice each tenday.

Additionally, [[iceguardian]]s who revered the Reindeer Mother alongside [[Ulutiu]] also could call upon the ''horns of wisdom'' or ''reindeer hooves'' once each day.
