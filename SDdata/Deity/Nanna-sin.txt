'''Nanna-Sin''' was the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric god]] of the moon. His manifestation on [[Toril]] was killed during the [[Orcgate Wars]]. His symbol was a black axe over a moon. He was resurrected as a non-god immortal by [[Asmodeus]] in [[1487 DR]]. 


==Description==
Nanna-Sin manifested as a [[human]] male bathed in blue light that ''beguiled'' all who came within ten feet of it. At will, he could negate any heat, cold, electricity, light, or darkness effects. In battle he wielded the [[Black Axe of the Moon's Champion]], a jet-black axe. 

== History  ==
Nanna-Sin presumedly came to [[Toril]] with the other Untheric deities aboard the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]''. He was killed by one of the [[orc pantheon|orcish gods]] in {{Yearlink|-1071}}, and his body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in [[Unther]].

In {{YearlinkName|1370}}, in an event known as [[the Vanishing]], the majority of the citizens of [[Shussel]] were magically and mysteriously carried away in a fog. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, these citizens returned as [[aasimar]] and called themselves the [[Legion of Nanna-Sin]]. They claimed that Nanna-Sin&mdash;perhaps acting as an [[aspect]] of [[Sel没ne]]&mdash;had taken them to Zigguraxus and transformed and trained them to be his army against the invading [[Mulhorand]]i army.

His tomb was destroyed by the fall of a [[dragonborn]] ''djerad'' during the [[Spellplague]]. The dragonborn [[Kepeshkmolik Thymara|Thymara]], one of the survivors of the catastrophe, was guided to Nanna-Sin's tomb by the goddess [[Sel没ne]], where she laid her eggs in safety. After the dragonborn constructed [[Djerad Thymar]] with the ruins of their ''djerad'' and the God-Tomb, they claimed Nanna-Sin as clan-kin to all the [[Thymari]] clans, and buried him in a specially build tomb in the lowest section of the [[Catacombs (Djerad Thymar)|Catacombs]]. 

On [[Hammer 10]] of 1487 DR, [[Enlil]] agreed to give Nanna-Sin's divine spark to Asmodeus, and in exchange Asmodeus agreed to revive Nanna-Sin as an immortal. After Nanna-Sin was resurrected, he took the form of a giant [[dragon turtle]], to destroy the [[Unther]]ite navy and lift the siege of [[Djerad Kethendi]].
