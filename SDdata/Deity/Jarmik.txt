Jarmik, the Thirsty Janni, was a local god of Zakhara.
The symbol of Jarmik was a janni sitting on his knees near a well.
Worshipers of Jarmik valued generosity and sharing.
The sacred well located at the Mosque of the Thirsty Jann was said to be the very spot where Jarmik left Zakhara to be with the gods.
