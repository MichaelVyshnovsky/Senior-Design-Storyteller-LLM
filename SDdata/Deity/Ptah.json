        "mainbody": "Ptah was a god who was a master of planar travel and could teleport anywhere in the multiverse with accuracy.\nPtah was summoned by Lord Ao and asked to carry a message to the deities on the home world of the Mulan, inviting them to create powerful avatars that could accompany Ptah to Realmspace where their people had been taken, bypassing the barriers put up by the Imaskari. Most of them agreed to make the sacrifice and the journey, so Ptah led the way using an artifact known as the Beacon of Light. Thus the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons came to Toril, landing on what was later called the Godswatch Mountains.\nIn the Outlands a sprawling, richly decorated and well-staffed temple of Ptah stood within The Ladys Ward of the city Sigil.\nSome legends claimed that Ptahs existence predated that of the Mulhorandi deity Ra, but he stepped down to let him take on his role."
