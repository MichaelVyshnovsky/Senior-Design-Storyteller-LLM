        "mainbody": "Piminasi was the Padhrasattva of Abundance within the Padhran religion.\nStatues depicted Piminasi as an immensely fat person with a cherubic expression.\nIn the Potala in Saikhoi, Ra-Khati, there was a small room containing a massive statue of Piminasi, staring out over a balcony at the eastern mountains. Once a month, when the light of the sun and the moon both fell upon the statues eyes (that is, when the full moon hung over the eastern horizon at sunrise), a secret door opened in the statues belly, leading to the Secret Vault of the Morning Moon, where treasures were kept."
