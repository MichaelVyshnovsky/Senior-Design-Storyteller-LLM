        "mainbody": "The Gluttony domain was a suite of spells that were granted by deities whose portfolios concerned the selfish desire for pleasure, experiences, and indulging every appetite.\nDuring the latter part of the Era of Upheaval, priests who chose this domain had access to the following spells as they grew stronger.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the goodberry, death knell, and create food and water spells. Clerics of some experience could cast vampiric touch, baleful polymorph, and heroes feast. Those that were masters in this domain had access to stone to flesh, bite of the king or swallow, and trap the soul.\nIn addition, clerics of the Gluttony domain gained the ability to receive the effects of the enlarge person spell."
