'''Watery Death''' was a prestige [[divine domain|domain]] granted to certain very experienced divine spellcasters, such as [[kuo-toa]]n [[sea mother whip]]s of [[Blibdoolpoolp]]. It bestowed the power to ''[[smite]]'' any non-aquatic creature once per day, and a range of killing water-themed spells.
