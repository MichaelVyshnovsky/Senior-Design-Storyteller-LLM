'''The Simbul''' was, in ancient times, the title given to a [[Yuir pantheon|Yuir power]] whom some described as the goddess of "the edge and the moment of choice."
{{quote
|I am the edge, [[Alassra Shentrantra]]. When the hunter facing the charging beast has to decide whether to throw his spear, whether to dodge, and the moment to do either, I am that moment. I was. When the hunted comes to two paths and, knowing neither, must still choose between them, I am that moment of choice. I am the edge of the cliff, the bending branch, the moment when you must jump. When you decide, without knowing why, without knowing anything at all, at that moment I am with you.
|The Simbul to the witch-queen who was her namesake.

==History==
The Simbul, like all the Yuir powers, was worshiped first by primitive [[human]]s who dwelled in the [[Yuirwood]], then by the Yuir [[elves]] that came to live there, and was later forgotten.

However, around midnight on [[Eleasis 25]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the queen of [[Aglarond]] who had become her better-known namesake, the [[Simbul]], had a conversation with her even as a battle raged in the [[Sunglade]].
