        "mainbody": "Lesser deity\nMurdane was a deceased lesser deity of pragmatism and reason.\nImages of the goddess showed her with a long ponytail of rich reddish-black hair.\nMurdanes holy symbol was a collection of three gears with interlocked teeth, viewed side-on and colored black over a golden field. The uppermost wheel was largest, the middle wheel was medium-sized, and the bottom wheel was smallest, forming an overall chevron-like shape.\nIn addition, a lock of hair of the same red-black hue was commonly used as a touchstone or keepsake for worship of Murdane or as an aid when working on a problem.\nShe was the lover of Helm the Watcher, god of guardians.\nDuring the divine event known as the Dawn Cataclysm, Lathander the Morninglord set into motion events that indirectly led to the death of Murdane.\nThis event was linked to the destruction of the empire of Jhaamdath beneath an enormous tsunami in the Year of Furious Waves, â€“255 DR. However, cause and effect were unclear whether Jhaamdaths flooding led to or was caused by Murdanes drowning was unknown.This suggests that Murdane was heavily worshiped in Jhaamdath, and perhaps even a member of the Jhaamdathan pantheon. However, Auppenser, who is heavily linked to and worshiped in Jhaamdath, is called the Lord of Reason. This suggests some overlap or close relationship between Murdane and Auppenser.\nThis caused Helm the Vigilant One to view Lathander with ill will thereafter.\nEven as late as the 15 century DR, some sages still venerated Murdane, considering her the greatest practitioner of logic and deduction, able to learn everything about a person from the minutest clues."
