'''Essylliss''' was a [[demigod]] of the [[lizardfolk]] with dominion over their race, but he was nearly forgotten by them. Essylliss was considered an aspect of the [[World Serpent]].

==History==
Following the creation of the lizardfolk race by the [[sarrukh]], the World Serpent worried they would be distracted by the call of the many other gods and that they needed a deity of their own. Thus he created a fragment of himself in the semblance of a lizardman, Essylliss.

Worship of Essylliss survived the decline of sarrukh rule in [[Mhairshaulk]] for some two millennia, until around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. However, the divided factions of lizardfolk eventually began to worship [[Semuanya]], another fragment of the World Serpent representing the instinct to survive.

By the 14th century [[DR]], almost no trace of Essylliss survived and only a small number of lizardfolk continued to worship him.

==Worshipers==
Essylliss's favored weapon was the [[club]]. [[Cleric]]s of Essylliss who cast ''[[weapon of the deity]]'' received a ''+1 [[impact]] club.''
