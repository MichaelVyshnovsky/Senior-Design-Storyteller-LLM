        "mainbody": "Dendar the Night Serpent was an elder evil\nDendar was a colossal serpent who spent her time devouring the nightmares and fears of both mortals and immortals in hopes of bringing about the end of the world. She was some  long with blue-black scales, yellow eyes, and a huge maw filled with four fangs, spittle, and the bones of some of her former victims.\nThe Night Serpent was able to use her enormous size to crush victims below her bulk or to swallow them whole. Her forked tongue could be used to trip and entangle victims whom she could then inject with a sleep poison so she could absorb their nightmares.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum was an Ubtao-worshiping cult in the jungles of Chult, who called her \"Eater of the World.\" They believed she lived beneath the Peaks of Flame and would one day emerge through a gigantic, iron door to devour the sun if Ubtao failed his duty when the end times came. They also believed it was their sacred duty to battle her. Another group of Kelemvor worshipers saw it as their sacred duty to take the battle to her on the Fugue Plane in order to siphon off the nightmares she had devoured thus keeping her power in check and earning a certain, if well-earned, death.\nCults to worship or battle Dendar existed almost as long as she did. Those who worshiped her often kidnapped victims and fed them poisons to cause them to dream. The most notable of these cults, known as the Sacred Order of Akabar, existed in Calimport, where she was dubbed the \"Serpent Mother\" and thought to have brought about the Night Parade.\nDendar was thought to have been created when the first mortal dream occurred, and she devoured the nightmares of the living ever since. Even the gods were not immune to her ravenous appetite for their dreams.\nIt was the Night Serpent who was thought to bring about the end of the Blue Age and usher in the Shadow Epoch by devouring the sun and plunging Toril into darkness and freezing temperatures.\nWhen a revolt against Cyric was underway in the City of Strife, Gwydion the Quick challenged Dendar and managed to injure her with a legendary blade that had belonged to Alban Onire. In concession to this defeat, she unleashed the night-terrors of the Bone Castles residents and thereby allowed the revolutionaries to storm the structure."
