During the Time of Troubles, the Red Knights avatar possessed Lady Kaitlin Tindall Bloodhawk. While possessed, she and her adventuring band traveled to Tethyr and successfully repelled a large army of monsters, earning the nations gratitude. However, she returned to her clans stronghold to find it destroyed. She reconstructed the fort and declared it a temple to the Red Lady, and from then on it was known as the Citadel of Strategic Militancy. In time, it became the center of worship for the Church of the Red Knight. Bloodhawk continued to lead the Order of the Red Falcon, a small knightly order worshiping the Red Knight that trained officers and others in tactics and military history.
The Red Knight, or the Red Lady as she was known locally, was the patron of the ruling family of Ankhapur and her clergy trusted with the care of the Cup and Knife - the traditional symbols of the Kings authority. This patronage ended in 1366 DR, when Janol Famisso took the throne and chose to favor Lathander. Of note is that in Ankhapur, the Red Knight was venerated by some as the Red Lord, a male deity, as opposed to elsewhere where she is exclusively considered female.
