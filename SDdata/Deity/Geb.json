Though once more curious and quick-tempered, he had mellowed since his birth to become a more cautious and even-tempered deity, slow to display emotion but appreciative of humor of all varieties.",
        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "Geb's will was often communicated through the acts of earth creatures such as [[stone golem]]s and [[rust monster]]s, or those of animals such as [[bear]]s and [[badger]]s.\n\nThose who displeased Lord Earth might experience an earthquake, while those who performed Geb's will might discover a cache of [[gem]]stones. Followers who planned to mine in unsafe regions might witness cracks forming in the ground and rock of the area to warn them.\n\nA follower of Geb might recognize the appearance of a dead canary to indicate unsafe air conditions, and the appearance of a fleeing rat as a sign that a mine or cave system might be unstable."
        },
        "Powers": "Geb could summon [[earth elemental]]s to his side, and could exert control over certain denizens of the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]].",
        "Possessions": "The avatars of Geb wielded an enchanted quarterstaff,",
        "Relationships": "Geb was the father of [[Isis]], [[Set]], [[Osiris]], and [[Nephthys]]. Other than Set, he remained on good terms with all his children. He also counted [[Flandal Steelskin]], [[Grumbar]], and [[Moradin]] as friends.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Church of Geb": "[[File:Priest of Geb.jpg|right|150px|thumb|''A priest of Geb.'']]\nThe position of a priest in the church of Geb was hereditary; members belonged to the [[House of Gebthant]] and who could claim at least one divine incarnation of Geb among their ancestors were viable. Geb's clergy was largely composed of humans native to [[Mulhorand]], but both [[dwarves]] and [[gnomes]] would occasionally follow the teachings of the King of the Riches Under the Earth.\n\nTemples dedicated to Geb utilized natural geographic formations in their construction as much as possible. Most of these sites were built underground to better facilitate this decision. At least one temple existed in each mountain range within the range of influence of the nation of Mulhorand.",
            "Affiliated Organizations": "* [[Fellowship of the Mithril Mountain]]: Charged with discovering the location of large [[mithril]] deposits, this order was composed primarily of traveling clerics of Geb.\n* [[Brotherhood of the Pick]]: The members of this order served as a representatives of the miners and craftsmen of Mulhorand, presenting their needs and wants to the nobility.\n\nThe church of Geb supported no known combat-oriented organizations.",
            "Celebrations & Festivals": "* Hidden Gift and Bountiful Joy: Clerics of Geb had to bury a precious stone or mineral each evening, which was then unearthed the following morning. These acts commemorated Geb's gifts to the earth and their eventual discovery.\n* The Unwrapping: Begun on the [[Mirtul 1|first of Mirtul]], the Unwrapping celebrated nature's tendency to uncover the secrets of the earth on its own.\n* Day of Drawing Down: In memory of those that died within the earth over the past year, one or more abandoned mines were collapsed on the [[Nightal 30|last day of Nightal]]."
        },
        "History": "Geb was the first child of the deities [[Shu (deity)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]]. He wed his sister, [[Nut (deity)|Nut]], and they had four children. The two were forcibly separated when Geb was ordered to join the Mulhorandi pantheon on [[Toril]].\n\nDuring the First Empire, Geb was considered an [[intermediate deity]] and his church flourished. However, due in part to inaction on the part of his clergy, Geb received little respect by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nGeb led his most faithful followers in building the [[Golden Forge]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]]. This temple served to prevent the eruption of a volcano that would devastate much of Unther's coastal regions."
