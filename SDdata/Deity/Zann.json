        "mainbody": "'''Zann''' was the scholarly [[deity]] of learning and intelligence of [[Zakhara]]. He was one of the [[Zakharan pantheon|eight Great Gods]] of the [[Land of Fate]] and preached the value of studying and understanding, of seeking new and preserving old knowledge. Zann's symbol was a fountain's jet.\n\nZann was portrayed as a man in city dress with all the paraphernalia of a scribe. Like other [[Zakharan]] gods he was above such concerns as [[alignment]], as knowledge and intelligence could be used to build a peaceful society or to subvert it. <br/>Zann's priests kept the greatest universities and libraries of Zakhara.",
