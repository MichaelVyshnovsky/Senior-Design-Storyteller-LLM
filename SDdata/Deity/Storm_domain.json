        "mainbody": "he Storm domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with storm-related spells and powers.\nThey gained a measure of resistance to electricity.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the entropic shield, gust of wind, and call lightning spells. Clerics of some experience could cast sleet storm, ice storm, and summon monster vi. Those that were masters of this domain had access to control weather, whirlwind, and storm of vengeance."
