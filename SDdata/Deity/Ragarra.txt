__NOTOC__
Ragarra was a Zakharan goddess who represented the jungle and its violent nature. She wanted to destroy any civilization that wanted to tame the wilderness around it and was therefore considered a savage goddess, i.e., a deity opposed to the culture of Enlightenment predominant in the Land of Fate.
Ragarras symbols included a cyclone, a green three-fingered claw and a baby crocodile biting its own tail. The deity, sometimes also called Raggara, was depicted as a crocodile-headed female with the wings of a bat. Her mate was Shajar, god of the Nogaro River. She filled a similar role in the Land of Fate as the god Malar did in Faer√ªn.
Her cult was driven underground long ago because of its anarchical nature, but became stronger in the years preceding 1367 DR, cowing parts of the local population with acts of violence. Most of her worshipers resided in or around the cities of Dihliz, Rogosto, and Kadarasto, where they had secret lairs.
Before its decline the empire of Kadar outlawed worship of Ragarra and destroyed all temples associated with the goddess, littering the jungle with ruins.
