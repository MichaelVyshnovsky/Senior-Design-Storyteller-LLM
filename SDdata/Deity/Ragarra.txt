}}__NOTOC__
'''Ragarra''' was a [[Zakhara]]n goddess who represented the jungle and its violent nature. She wanted to destroy any civilization that wanted to tame the wilderness around it and was therefore considered a [[Zakharan pantheon#Savage gods|savage goddess]], ''i.e.'', a deity opposed to the culture of Enlightenment predominant in the Land of Fate.

{{quote|''Great is Ragarra, goddess of the jungle. Great is the goddess of the typhoon. Great is the goddess of revenge. Blessed are you that you have been chosen Blessed are you, a sacrifice to the goddess of revenge. Feel the blessing.''|A ''[[magic mouth]]'' message of Ragarra's temple{{Cite organized play/AG/Where the Teak Snakes Slither|9}}}}<br/>

Ragarra's symbols included a cyclone, a green three-fingered claw and a baby [[crocodile]] biting its own tail. The deity, sometimes also called Raggara, was depicted as a crocodile-headed female with the wings of a bat. Her mate was [[Shajar]], god of the [[Nogaro River]]. She filled a similar role in the Land of Fate as the god [[Malar]] did in [[Faer√ªn]].

Her [[Cult of Ragarra|cult]] was driven underground long ago because of its anarchical nature, but became stronger in the years preceding [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} cowing parts of the local population with acts of violence. Most of her worshipers resided in or around the cities of [[Dihliz]], [[Rog'osto]], and [[Kadarasto]], where they had secret lairs.{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|12-13}}

==History==
Before its decline the empire of [[Kadar]] outlawed worship of Ragarra and destroyed all temples associated with the goddess, littering the jungle with ruins.
