        "Activities": "Tharmekhûl's interests were fairly narrow. He might task his followers with the kindling of new forges with [[elemental fire]], or with retrieving relics from ancient dwarven forges.",

            "Rituals": "Liturgy for Tharmekhûl was chocked with fire imagery, representing, for example, external dangers that tempered the dwarf race as a whole. Rites honoring him all involved tending to an actual forge, preparing it for use, stoking the flames, and then damping them. The Tender of the Forge didn't have his own temples, his clerics instead offering prayers as they tended to the forge in the heart of Moradin's temples."
