        "mainbody": "'''Siamorphe''' ({{Pronounce|SY|a|morf|refs=}} {{Pronounce|SEE|a|morf|refs=|alt=yes}}) was a [[demipower]] of nobles and nobles' divine right to rule. She encouraged them to rule well and wisely for the more common classes beneath them. Her worship was most common among the nobility and their councilors, especially among those who sought reasons to explain why they were in charge.\n\n'''The Divine Right''' was the vessel of a semi-divine power that was passed down to a successor when the successor was dying. At any one time, the current Siamorphe was the latest in that lineage. By preference, the successor was a direct descendant of the previous power's mortal form, but anyone of noble blood would suffice. In the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries, the present Siamorphe was one Lady Siamorphe of [[Waterdeep]], chosen when she was killed in a riot in the {{yearlinkName|1256}}, inheriting the role from the former Siamorphe, who was a nobleman of [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "Description": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, Siamorphe usually appeared as an older lady of the nobility, her hair touched with grey but well kept, and her iron-gray eyes missing nothing. Her clothing showed the jeweled purple of the true nobility, with a [[silver]] chalice and [[adamantine]] scepter in her hands, and a tiara carved from a single [[diamond]] on her brow.",
        "Relationships": "Though she dwelled in the [[House of the Triad]], she had no true allies or superiors among the gods.\n\nShe opposed those who fostered tyranny and corruption, most especially [[Bane]], [[Cyric]], and [[Gargauth]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "The faith argued that nobles were given a divine right to rule, provided they ruled responsibly and well. The nobility had an obligation to rule with the best interest of their subjects in mind, even when those obligations interfered with their personal desires.\n\nThe benefits of nobility were provided to them so that they could rule well. Their wisdom and charisma were inherited from their noble ancestors, and the leisure that their station provided was theirs so that they might be educated to properly perform their duties.",
            "Temples": "Most of Siamorphe's temples were small family shrines in the houses of the nobility of Waterdeep, and recently in Tethyr. Her only true remaining temple was the [[Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right]] in Waterdeep. The relatively small house of worship was within the walls of the [[Assumbar]] family's villa, and was the central building of the three that bordered the Street of the Singing Dolphin."
