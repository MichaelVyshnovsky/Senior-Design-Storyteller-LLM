Haaashastaak was a demigod of lizardkind who was worshiped on Toril by beast cults.
Haaashastaak was primarily worshiped by intelligent reptiles, though some humanoids also showed it reverence.
Some sages in the Realms speculated that Haaashastaak was nothing more than an aspect of Sebek, the Untheric god of crocodiles, though a more popular theory among sages was that the Master of all Lizardkind was an aspect of the Chultan deity Ubtao.
