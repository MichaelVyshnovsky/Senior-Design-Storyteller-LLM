'''Bimasara''' was the [[Padhrasattva]] of Barter within the [[Padhran religion]].

==Description==
In statuary, Bimasara was depicted as a man with a pleasant smile, with one hand holding a sheath of [[barley]] and the other held up with palm up to receive payment.

==History==
Before the city was destroyed, [[Kushk]] in [[Ra-Khati]] held a large collection of Bimasara's followers. They dwelled in the trade city's third district, where they acted as go-betweens and agents so Ra-Khatian and foreign merchants never met, and thus were viewed as "unclean". However, they skimmed a very small percentage of every sale, and so in time grew wealthy. With this money, they built their temple, called the [[Holy Mountain of Kus]].

==Practices==
Followers of Bimasara undertook a series of tests within the bowels of [[Mount Kus]]. Only the wisest of them were able to make it to the [[Tower of Harmony]] that sat atop the mountain.

==Notable Followers==
[[Ambuchar Devayam]] was once one of the most effective monks of Bimasara.
