        "mainbody": "Lendys (Pronounce|LEN|dis|refs=\nIn his natural form, Lendys was a huge, wingless platinum dragon with tarnished scales, and his eyes gleamed with brilliant beams of light so no one could hide from his gaze. Some say that he cared more about judging others than himself.\nLendys had a lair in the plane of Nirvana.\nLendys was worshiped mostly by lawful dragons, but they usually tried to balance his implacability with mercy of their own. \nLendyss clergy served as judges among dragonkind. In some cases, towns even asked a cleric of Lendys to parse out justice.\nThere were few temples to the dragon god of Justice. Most dragons often had small shrines to him in their lairs. Other races had a small shrine engraved with his holy symbol set up in a courtroom or courthouse.\nLendys was justice personified. As such, he represented the principle that every action had a reaction and that everything had to be balanced at the end. It was Lendys who ensured that those who did evil acts were rewarded with evil, that those who did good received good, and those who lived by the sword died by the sword. He had no mercy in his soul, nor forgiveness, and gave no second chances.\nAs arbiter of dragonkind, Lendys served as judge, jury, and executioner. When a dragon committed an injustice against all dragons, Lendys or one of his great wyrm followers went to dispatch appropriate justice. Punishments were severe and no one heard of anyone appealing to his mercy.\nSome of his dragon adepts followed the Ptarian Code, a draconic code of honor created by the gold dragon Ptaris in the ancient past. Originally intended as a guide to conduct for the lords who attended the King of Justice, the Ptarian Code eventually was adopted by many gold and silver dragons.\nThe Ptarian Code was similar to the codes of chivalry adopted by knightly orders of humanity. It included paying homage to Lendys, as well to the draconic deities Bahamut and Tamara. The major precepts were\nJustice and Good above all.\nHonor and Fealty to the King.\nHonor and Respect to Righteous Innocence. \nHonor and Duty to the Balancer (Lendys), to Her Mercy (Tamara), and to the Justicemaker (Bahamut). \nHonor and Protection to the Lesser Races. \nHonor and Correction to the Enemies of Justice and Good. \nHonor and Forbearance for oneself.\nAny trial for justice counted as a rite to Lendys. The duty of finding the truth in a trial was taken seriously by his clergy. Although the god often focused his judgement exclusively on dragons, other races who worshiped him usually generalized any act of justice as an honor."
