        "Divine Realm": "Merrshaulk's divine realm was called [[Smaragd]] and was the 74th layer of the [[Abyss]]. The [[bullywug]] god [[Ramenos]] also slumbered on this layer.<ref>",
        "Worshipers": "Although once the primary deity of the yuan-ti, Merrshaulk came to only be worshiped by the outcasts of that species. These outcasts believed that worshiping Sseth was foolish and decadent.<ref> Merrshaulk was also the god worshiped by the [[asabi]] of [[Oreme]], as he was the deity of their sarrukh masters.<ref>\n\nMerrshaulk was a multiversal power, still actively worshiped by the yuan-ti of other worlds.<ref><ref>",
        "History": "Merrshaulk was one of the divine fragments that split off from the [[World Serpent]]. As the World Serpent ceased being actively worshiped by scalykind in favor of its aspects during the [[Days of Thunder]], it was primarily the yuan-ti who took up the worship of Merrshaulk.\n\nWhen some of the sarrukh of [[Okoth]] were transformed into [[couatl]]s by [[Jazirian]], they warred with their former kin. Despite being outnumbered, the couatls battled the sarrukh to a stalemate, but then Merrshaulk personally fought against Jazirian and killed his fellow World Serpent fragment, causing the couatls to flee.<ref>{{cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|55}}\n\nMerrshaulk eventually entered a period of somnolence and failed to consistently answer the prayers of his priests. He was eventually awakened by the sarrukh emperor [[Pil'it'ith]]. Merrshaulk thanked Pil'it'ith for his service to scalykind and directed him to create a new sarrukh homeland, promising to once more watch over the sarrukh and making Pil'it'ith his [[Chosen]]. Later, in the {{YearlinkName|-304}}, a charismatic winged snake calling itself [[Sseth]] appeared to the yuan-ti, declaring itself Merrshaulk reborn. Sseth then became the primary deity of the yuan-ti and Pil'it'ith's subjects, with only a few holdouts of Merrshaulk's faith, stubbornly clinging to the old ways.\n\nAfter Sseth's ascendancy, Merrshaulk became an [[aspect]] of Sseth for those who did not know of or refused to worship Merrshaulk's 'replacement' and as a result, when [[Set]] had Sseth imprisoned during the [[Time of Troubles]], Set also took on the guise of Merrshaulk.\n\n''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], a monstrous aspect of Merrshaulk, identified as \"the Eternal Hunger,\" was defeated by the [[adventurer]]s [[Rannek]], [[Zhai]], and [[Illius]] at a yuan-ti temple in [[Chult]].<ref>"
