His clerics were known as vrael olo (meaning favored ones). His symbol was a cobras head.\nMerrshaulks divine realm was called Smaragd and was the 74th layer of the Abyss. The bullywug god Ramenos also slumbered on this layer.\nAlthough once the primary deity of the yuan-ti, Merrshaulk came to only be worshiped by the outcasts of that species. These outcasts believed that worshiping Sseth was foolish and decadent. Merrshaulk was also the god worshiped by the asabi of Oreme, as he was the deity of their sarrukh masters.\nMerrshaulk was a multiversal power, still actively worshiped by the yuan-ti of other worlds.\nMerrshaulk was one of the divine fragments that split off from the World Serpent. As the World Serpent ceased being actively worshiped by scalykind in favor of its aspects during the Days of Thunder, it was primarily the yuan-ti who took up the worship of Merrshaulk.\nWhen some of the sarrukh of Okoth were transformed into couatls by Jazirian, they warred with their former kin. Despite being outnumbered, the couatls battled the sarrukh to a stalemate, but then Merrshaulk personally fought against Jazirian and killed his fellow World Serpent fragment, causing the couatls to flee.\nMerrshaulk eventually entered a period of somnolence and failed to consistently answer the prayers of his priests. He was eventually awakened by the sarrukh emperor Pilitith. Merrshaulk thanked Pilitith for his service to scalykind and directed him to create a new sarrukh homeland, promising to once more watch over the sarrukh and making Pilitith his Chosen. Later, in the , a charismatic winged snake calling itself Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti, declaring itself Merrshaulk reborn. Sseth then became the primary deity of the yuan-ti and Pilitiths subjects, with only a few holdouts of Merrshaulks faith, stubbornly clinging to the old ways.\nAfter Sseths ascendancy, Merrshaulk became an aspect of Sseth for those who did not know of or refused to worship Merrshaulks replacement and as a result, when Set had Sseth imprisoned during the Time of Troubles, Set also took on the guise of Merrshaulk.\nCirca 1373 DR, a monstrous aspect of Merrshaulk, identified as \"the Eternal Hunger,\" was defeated by the adventurers Rannek, Zhai, and Illius at a yuan-ti temple in Chult."
