The Demonic domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to demons.
The unarmed blows and natural weapons of a priest with the Demonic domain became divinely empowered.
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could protect their body with demonflesh or even fly with demon wings, or acquire their profane knowledge with demoncall. Later, they could see in darkness, invisible things, and the trace of goodness with fiendish clarity and create great darkness that only only evil beings could see through with utterdark. They could also summon and bind outsiders with lesser and regular planar binding, prevent extradimensional travel with dimensional anchor, and ultimately travel between planes directly with gate.
