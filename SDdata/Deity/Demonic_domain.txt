==Powers==
The unarmed blows and natural weapons of a priest with the Demonic domain became divinely empowered.

==Spells==
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could protect their body with ''[[demonflesh]]'' or even fly with ''[[demon wings]]'', or acquire their profane knowledge with ''[[demoncall]]''. Later, they could see in darkness, invisible things, and the trace of goodness with ''[[fiendish clarity]]'' and create great darkness that only only evil beings could see through with ''[[Utterdark (spell)|utterdark]]''. They could also summon and bind [[outsider]]s with ''[[lesser planar binding|lesser]]'' and regular ''[[planar binding]]'', prevent extradimensional travel with ''[[dimensional anchor]]'', and ultimately travel between [[planes]] directly with ''[[gate]]''.
