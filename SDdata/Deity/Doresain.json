        "Description": "[[File:Doresain2e.png|273px|thumb|right|A form of Doresain on the Prime Material Plane.]]\nDoresain took the appearance of a ghoul whose eyes glowed with vile green energy. He had hoof-like feet and wore an elegant coat over [[leather armor]], which was adorned with skulls.\n\nHe was known for creating hordes of ghouls, as well as [[maurezhi]], which he made to lead legions of ghouls and [[ghast]]s to the [[Prime Material Plane]].",
        "History": {
            "Early history": "Doresain was once a mortal [[elf]] and a worshiper of Orcus. In order to honor his deity, he feasted on the flesh of his fellow elves. Impressed by the raw and savage act, Orcus turned Doresain into the very first ghoul.{{Cite dragon/252/The Ecology of the Ghoul|94,98}}The corresponding [[Dungeon magazine|''Dungeon'' magazine]] adventure has Doresain as a king of ghouls of Oerth's Underdark in 586 CY ([[1366 DR]]). It is likely that this was the avatar form of Doresain, instead of his actual mortal form. This is because ''[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]]'' states that conquering the divine realm of Doresain was one of Yeenoghu's \"earliest\" triumphs, which most likely happened far before 1366 DR.",
            "Rise to Divinity": "Doresain became a servitor to Orcus in the [[Abyss]].",
            "Conquered": "Despite his devotion, Doresain would not stay subservient to Orcus, though not by choice. [[Yeenoghu]] staged an invasion of Doresain's layer (421st layer of the Abyss), which was right next to the Gnoll Lord's own layer (422nd layer of the Abyss). Orcus did not intervene, leaving Doresain to became a vassal of Yeenoghu. Instead of serving Yeenoghu, Doresain instead turned to the [[Seldarine]]. They took pity on the demigod, who was then able to escape the Gnoll Lord's tyranny in return for granting [[elves]] immunity to the paralytic touch of his minions. Yeenoghu later lost the ability to fully control Doresain.",
            "Return to Orcus": "As of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Doresain retained the shard of divinity originally given to him by Orcus. He returned to Orcus' side, this time as his [[exarch]], as well as his servitor. No longer holding his original layer, the White Kingdom, Doresain settled into the layer owned by Orcus, [[Thanatos (layer)|Thanatos]], the 113{{th}} layer of the Abyss. Here, Doresain began to rule over part of Thanatos known as [[White Kingdom (Thanatos)|White Kingdom]], which had the same name as his former home."
        },
        "Worshipers": "[[File:DoresainSymbol.png|273px|thumb|right|The [[holy symbol]] of Doresain.]]\nDoresain had several followers, particularly [[undead]] and especially ghouls. He was known to venture to the [[Negative Energy plane]] and seek out necromancers that were meddling there with the goal of turning them into ghouls. Doresain's holy symbol was the skull of a single ghoul, and though many ghouls did not know of or worship deities, those that did were known to pay homage to Doresain. \n\nThe [[Temple of Filth]], in the [[Shadowfell]]'s version of [[Neverwinter]], was once a shrine to [[Bhaal]] and [[Myrkul]]. It later became dedicated to Orcus and Doresain.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The [[undead]] of [[Evernight]] believed that the [[Demon Pit]] led to the White Kingdom in Thanatos."
