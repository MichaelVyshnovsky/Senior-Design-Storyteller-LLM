The Rune domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with rune-related spells and powers.
They gained the ability to write magical scrolls.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the erase, secret page, and glyph of warding spells. Clerics of some experience could cast explosive runes, lesser planar binding, and greater glyph of warding. Those that were masters of this domain had access to drawmijs instant summons, symbol, and teleportation circle.
