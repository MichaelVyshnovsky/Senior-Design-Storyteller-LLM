'''Lalibela''', also known as '''St. Lalibela''', was a minor [[goddess]]Although said to be a "demigoddess of the nixies" in ''[[The Mines of Bloodstone]]'', the description and power of Lalibela there is closer to that of a [[nymph]]. In ''[[The Throne of Bloodstone]]'', she is renamed "St. Lalibela". Like [[St. Dionysus]] and [[St. Sollars]], also introduced in the [[Bloodstone Pass series]], it may be that she is a saint of [[Ilmater]]. This also fits with Gareth being a paladin of Ilmater.

==Description==
Lalibela possessed incredible beauty and went naked.

==Powers==
The very sight of Lalibela unclothed could strike a mortal male dead except those she chose. And, unfortunately for everyone else, she didn't wear clothes.

Anyone who attacked her would suffer the blow themselves.

==Possessions==
The sword ''[[Crusader (sword)|Crusader]]'' could be used to [[commune]] with Lalibela.

==History==

In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], at a small, crystal-clear subterranean lake in the [[Deepearth]] region of the [[Underdark]] beneath [[Damara]], Lalibela appeared to the [[paladin]] [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], believing him to be of pure heart. Via ''[[telepathy]]'', she bade him set aside his armor, weapons, and equipment, and walk across the lake. Rising out of the lake, she granted him the magic sword ''Crusader'' but spirited away his other weapons and tools before she sank back beneath the water. The weapon would be a great boon in his battles against [[demon]]s, but if its wielder ever showed cowardice against them, it would return to Lalibela.The "Lady of the Lake" scene in ''The Mines of Bloodstone'' (based on the [[Wikipedia:Lady of the Lake|Lady of the Lake]] character of Arthurian myth) is an optional event for paladins. Later adventures and ''[[The Bloodstone Lands (sourcebook)|The Bloodstone Lands]]'' give Gareth ''Crusader'', implying this event happened the same way for him.
