        "mainbody": "Soma was an interloper deity of moons, plants, and prophecies in the Vedic pantheon.There were no known worshipers of Soma in the Realms, particularly Malatra where some other Vedic powers were worshiped. However, Soma is detailed on this wiki because of her relations with the Faer没nian power Sel没ne, as detailed in On Hallowed Ground and Planes of Chaos.\nThe avatar of Soma generally took the form of a giant with silver-skin, though at other times he was known to manifest as a bird or bull. His true form was said to be that of a moon.\nThis deity was generally a charitable and kind person, but they were also rather proud and vain.\nRather than calling upon the divine spells of his spheres, the avatar of Soma typically utilized arcane spells from the phantasms sub-school of Illusion.\nSoma carried an enchanted dagger that caused those struck by it to momentarily become convinced that they were struck dead.\nSoma resided on the Ysgard layer (or \"Asgard\") of the plane of Ysgard, where he shared the divine realm known as the Gates of the Moon with Sel没ne, the Faer没nian goddess of the moon of Realmspace.\nWith Selunes blessing, the petitioners of Soma distilled a juice from special flowers that were dotted around the Gates of the Moon. This juice was rumored to provide insight into the future. Soma also devoted a portion of his time to amassing a collection of beautiful things, for the deity believed that the horde of items reflected well upon his person.\nMuch like Selune, Soma was served by both lillendi and lycanthropes. However, unlike Selune, he also commanded a legion of asuras. These servants of his were rarely seen outside the Gates of the Moon and were unrecognizable to most petitioners in Ysgard.\nIn addition to divine spells from Somas spheres, his priests were provided the spells find the path, plant growth, and programmed illusion."
