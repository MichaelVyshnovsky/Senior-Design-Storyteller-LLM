'''Siragle''' was a [[demon lord]] referred to as '''The Ineffable''' who ruled over the 493{{rd}} layer of the [[Abyss]] known as [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 493: The Steeping Isle|The Steeping Isle]]. Siragle was the patron of secret oaths.

==Description==
Siragle was a humanoid reptilian creature about {{SI|8.5|ft|long=yes}}, with a muscular humanoid body fully {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} wide and a {{SIAdj|5|ft|adj=long}} tail. His head was that of a [[crocodile]] with blood-red eyes and soot-black teeth, crowned with sharp black antlers. His tail ended in a yellowed ivory stinger, and his hands ended in vicious claws. Siragle's leathery skin was blackish-green in color.{{Cite dungeon/28/Sleepless|26, 28}}

==Abilities==
Like most demon lords, Siragle had a number of spell-like abilities he could use at will, including ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[darkness 10' radius]]'', ''[[infravision]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[fly]]'', and ''[[dispel magic]]''; thrice each day he could use ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[shout]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[planeshift]]'', ''[[teleport]]''; once per day ''[[chaos]]'' and ''[[gate]]'' to summon 2-4 [[chasme]]s; once per week he could use ''[[mass charm]]'' and ''[[forcecage]]''.

Additionally, when Siragle hit a creature with his tail, he could potentially drain health from that creature and use it to heal himself.

==History==
Siragle was one of the few entities to have escaped from the [[Wells of Darkness]].<ref>
