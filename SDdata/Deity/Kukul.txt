Kukul was one of the two elder deities in the Maztican pantheon, and was considered the father of the gods.
Kukuls appearance was unrecorded, but he was speculated to have been a being of pure gold, with a humanoid form it was also believed that he had been mountain-sized.
It was also said that the stars that rotated predictably and the unpredictable shooting stars were Kukuls memory.
Kukul was the husband of the goddess Maztica. With her he was the father of the gods Qotal, Zaltec, Azul, Tezca, and Plutoq, and the goddesses Kiltzi, Watil, and Nula. Later, after his children repeatedly failed to make people, he made the first humans by cutting off some of his fingers, which fell to the ground and became humans. After Zaltec assaulted Maztica, he fell into despair and later vanished.
Kukul did not have any priests, and did not grant any spells. He was mostly worshiped by sages and scholars as a god of knowledge and stars.
The priests of the younger gods remembered Kukul favorably, for his possible death of grief and shame was seen as honorable, though they always blamed a god not the one they worshiped for causing it (priests of Qotal blamed Zaltec and vice versa).
