        "mainbody": "Azharul was a dragon god who lived in Dragon Eyrie, reputed for his mastery of magic.\nHis natural form was that of a fearsome, bad-tempered old dragon with many long, sharp projecting body-barbs.\nAzharuls realm was known as the Dragonspawn Pits, located in the Dragon Eyries lowest region, the dark roots.\nAzharul was an old rival of Tiamat in the draconic pantheon. For that reason, after Tiamats realm in Heliopolis was discovered to be a hoax by members of the Twisted Rune, in 1371 DR, she mind controlled those members and with their aid killed Azharul on his realm. She subsumed his divine essence, taking his body and divine realm, completely unbeknownst to anyone but herself."
