Byubo was the Padhrasattva of Nyum within the Padhran religion. "Nyum" was a Ra-Khatian concept combining spirit, courage, and audaciousness, most similar to chutzpah.
In life, Byubo was a follower of the Padhra and one of those who achieved "eaum", or a state of enlightenment. He ascended to join the Padhra and become a padhrasttva.
Byubo was often depicted in statuary as a man of comical proportions, with short stubby legs and long gangly arms, displaying a wide and loutish grin.
The Order of Rainbow Monks at the Rainbow Monastery worshiped Byubo. In exchange for donations to the order, they helped pilgrims and travelers passing through the Gogrus Chasm region of the Katakoro Shan range in Ra-Khati. They operated hospices for travelers and transported cargo up the chasm wall.
Byubos Lamp of Audacity, held by the statue of Byubo in the Purple Priory of the Rainbow Monastery, was a potent magical item for those of the Padhran faith.
