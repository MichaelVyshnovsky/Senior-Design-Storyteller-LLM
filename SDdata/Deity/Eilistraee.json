She was tall (9 feet/2.7 meters in height) and lithe, with graceful, strong limbs and a glossy, obsidian-dark skin. She usually appeared unclad, cloaked only by her ankle-length hair that shone with a bright silvery hue, and by motes of moonlight that were ever-dancing about her body.\n\nHer face bore a certain similarity to that of her mother, [[Lolth]], as it possessed delicately sculpted features and shape, but her eyes were large, with irises that held the shifting hint of blue of a moonstone, and expressive of her mood or emotions.\n\nWhen Eilistraee spoke, her voice always carried a soft musicality that made mortals instinctively drawn to it. Such attraction didn't cloud their minds, nor was of magical origin—it was as simple as the sound of a beautiful song.\n\nOverall, the Dark Maiden's appearance inspired utter awe and astonishment, as well as emotions so deep to move mortals to tears.",
        "Personality": "{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 300px\n| source = [[Lolth|Araushnee]], on Eilistraee.\n| text   = One moment she was a carefree child dancing like a moonbeam or running like a silver wolf through the forest; the next moment, she was either as seductive as a siren or as serious as a dwarven god.\n}}Due to a history of grief and losses, and to the suffering of her people, melancholy and sadness were deeply rooted in Eilistraee's heart. It was a hard battle to endure, one that could weigh her down. However, it had also taught her to search for and nurture beauty everywhere, even in places like the Underdark, where it didn't seem to belong. Eilistraee fought her melancholy by striving to bring hope and joy where there was sorrow, so that no moment was lost to gloom, and to make life flourish wherever she went. She learned to find happiness in peace and arts, especially music and dance; in simple things like seeing artists composing and performing, craftsmen at their work, and people doing acts of kindness. She especially took delight in helping the needy in various practical ways, with a soft spot for outcasts, and in blessing artists with sudden bursts of creativity and inspiration. and seeing lovers during tender moments made her happy.\n\nAs a young goddess, Eilistraee was a free spirit with an unpredictable temper. Even as she matured, these traits never really left her: she had a fiery streak and was prone to wild action, especially in protection of her faithful when they were harmed. The evil that was inflicted upon—and perpetuated by—most drow caused a burning anger within her, one that could cause her to lash out, but she was comforted that some worked their way free of the [[Lolth|Spider Queen's]] web.\n\nThe Dark Maiden was particularly close to her people. Aside from providing practical help in their everyday life, she was known to offer comfort and support in various ways, including listening to them as they let out or vented their personal emotions and experiences (see [[Eilistraee#Activities|Activities]]).[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rz42XOUhvI Ed Greenwood on YouTube: The Court of the Dance]\n\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 250px\n| source = [[Lords of Waterdeep (board game)|''Lords of Waterdeep'']]\n| text   = The Dark Lady smiles on those who see the deeper beauty within.\n}}\n\nThough focused on the drow, Eilistraee accepted folk of all races who danced along her path, who delighted in life and in the free-form expression of it in all its forms. She fought so that all races could live peacefully together, helping and accepting each other despite their differences,",

            "Manifestations": "[[File:Eilistraeeans - Drow of the Underdark.jpg|thumb|left|Eilistraee watches over a gathering of her faithful.]]\nHer most common sign was a silvery radiance (sometimes accompanied by a snatch of song or a few echoing notes of a harp) that could also take the form of a handful of dancing moonbeams or moon-motes. Eilistraee used this light to assist her people: she was known to use it as a beacon guiding those lost in the woods, to shine a light on something dropped in the dark, to illuminate a dark place where women gave birth, or to generally guide those who saw the manifestation. She also used it to bless a worshiper in various ways. Swords enveloped by the silvery light could not be broken or damaged and struck with maximum force. Living creatures would always react first in battle, could better evade or withstand blows, could strike more accurately, and could wound even creatures that needed magic to be harmed.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 5812\n| postid     = 159791\n| whichpage  = 56\n| date       = 2006-11-06\n| accessdate = \n}}\n\nHer song was another iconic manifestation, and the Dark Maiden's way of calling the drow to her, luring them towards a different life. However and whenever the goddess appeared, her song was heard. It was a tune of unearthly beauty, moving many to tears At times, Eilistraee would appear in person, to show her favor, give a blessing, or hearten her followers. Mortals lucky enough to see her would always hear her tune, but usually only glimpsed her from afar, balanced atop a distant hillock or battlement, with her silver hair flowing behind her. At times, she could also appear during celebrations dedicated to her, leaping inside the flames of bonfires, or manifest herself by night, cloaked and cowled and with her radiance dimmed, to travelers in the woodlands, usually to test their kindness.\n\nSometimes, Eilistraee would use her radiance to bless the faithful or even non-faithful who decided to honor her with a solitary dance, turning the creature's hair into a mane of silvery, dancing flames. This could last as long as a month, or even be permanent. She would also very often<ref group=\"note\">About 68% of the time. manifest when one of her priests led a new convert to her faith in prayer, which was itself an offering to Eilistraee.\n\nOn rare occasions, she could decide to grant a lay follower who nevertheless did her work with the temporary ability to manifest her [[Eilistraee's moonfire|''moonfire'']]. This could be to show her blessing or support, or simply to provide some light. However, the bearer had no control over the ''moonfire''&#39;s duration, intensity, or location—such things were solely up to the goddess.\n\nThe sound of a high and distant hunting horn was another sign associated to the Dark Maiden. She was known to conjure it to rally or hearten her followers, or to scare off bandits or [[orc]] raiders, who would believe reinforcements were coming for those harassed. When there were no enemies about, worshipers took the sound of the horn to mean there was someone close by they needed to aid.\n\nEilistraee demonstrated her favor and happiness through the discovery of particular minerals or gems (like [[mithral]], [[moonbar]]s, [[moonstone]]s, and [[silver]]) or with a sudden inspiration to write a beautiful song or poem, or to craft a magnificent sword for those who had the ability.\n\nHowever, the Dark Dancer could also let her displeasure be known, and did so by making a cold breeze rise, by making the disfavored ones feel a chill in their hands or feet, through a sudden lack of inspiration or talent in any form of art, or through the failure to catch anything while hunting.",
            "Abilities": "Eilistraee's identity as a nurturing and artistic goddess showed in her magic and skills. Despite having access to all kinds of magic, she focused on powers related to nature, life, creation, and enchantment. She was also an excellent crafter and weaponsmith, and could freely create almost any magical item pertaining to beauty, music, moonlight, hunting, or swordwork..\n\nFurthermore, before being a warrior or a huntress, Eilistraee was first and foremost a bard and an artist. She was a sublime dancer and singer, a terrific acrobat, and a brilliant musician. Her art had the power to elicit intense emotions in her allies and foes alike (to the point of sometimes leaving them stunned), or to inspire courage, dispel uncertainty and hopelessness, and enhance her allies' focus. She delighted in performing, and such was the beauty she created, that it could even move beings who were normally incapable of feeling emotions, or that could shrug them off due to training, magic, or nature.\n\nMusic and song held a particular meaning, as they were the intimate nature of Eilistraee's iconic magic, the Spellsong. Its melody was capable of physically healing, creating, and protecting, and allowed its practitioners to travel to places far away and see the world.<ref> Through the Spellsong, Eilistraee taught to listen to the songs of distant lands, the melody that a place and its people \"sung\" when lit by the moon, and to travel to such places along beams of moonlight, summoned by singing and dancing to its rhythm.<ref>\n\nThat said, while her warrior skills came second to her bardic magic and artistic abilities, Eilistraee could indeed fight. She was a protectress to her people, who wielded her bastard sword combining the agility of her dance with the lethality of her swordplay. Her hunting skills and precision as an archer (though she abandoned the bow after she was tricked into nearly slaying her father with it) were also undeniable, like her knowledge in matters of magic, nature, and faith.\n\nFinally, along with all the standard powers and godly senses of a deity of her rank, the Dark Dancer could instantly become aware of threats posed to good-aligned drow, to her followers, or to drow thinking of rejecting the faith of the deities of the Dark Seldarine, but only if their number was equal to or greater than five hundred.",
            "Eilistraee's Avatar": "[[File:Eilistraee - DD.jpg|thumb|right|Eilistraee's avatar was often seen dancing against the full moon.]]Eilistraee's avatar appeared as the goddess herself, described above.\n\nShe could use any kind of spell from any school or [[sphere]] of magic, but preferred those from the [[Animal sphere|animal]], [[Plant sphere|plant]], [[Healing sphere|healing]], [[Creation sphere|creation]], and [[Charm sphere|charm/enchantment]] spheres. She had continuous ''[[true seeing]]'', enabling her to see all things as they truly were, whether invisible, disguise, blurred, or hidden. She could instantly, at will, unleash nine silvery ''[[magic missile]]s'' (more potent against evil) or [[spell turning|turn spells]] back against their casters; could ''[[levitate]]'' at will; and quickly regenerate wounds or even lost limbs. Also at will, she could conjure a silvery ''[[light]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', or [[Eilistraee's moonfire|''moonfire'']] and make the sounds of flutes, harps, or horns. Her music had the power to [[repulsion|repel]] [[evil]] beings and [[undead]], briefly stun a creature, and unlock things as a ''[[knock]]'' spell.\n\nIn battle, she could wield either two identical ''[[singing sword]]s of [[Sword of dancing|dancing]] +3'', or a single blade, the ''[[Moonsword]]'', a ''+5 [[Sword of dancing|dancing]] [[keen]] [[bastard sword]]''. Only enchanted weapons could harm her.\n\nWhen she wished to appear clothed, Eilistraee's avatar could manifest wearing deep brown leather boots that allowed her to move in total silence and without leaving any trace at will. It combined the powers of the ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', ''[[boots of varied tracks]]'', and ''[[boots of the north]]''. She could also wear a dappled green cloak that shifted its color according to the surrounding environment (combining a ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]'' and a ''[[ring of chameleon power]]'', rendering the goddess' avatar invisible in natural areas)."

        "Realm": "Under the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Eilistraee had her home in [[Svartalfheim]], the drow domain of [[Nidavellir]], the third layer of the plane of [[Ysgard]]. Svartalfheim was an underground realm of tunnels heated by hot springs, characterized by precious or semiprecious minerals and subterranean forests that only needed heat to live.\n\nUnder the [[World Tree cosmology]], Eilistraee had her home in [[Arvandor]], a plane of natural beauty, with the elven gods of the Seldarine. Within its borders, the night was perpetual, with the moon ever-shining in the deep blue sky. Faith was more potent here than in the rest of Arvandor, and all followers of the other drow gods of the Dark Seldarine suffered minor impediments. Her realm here was small, however, as she split her divine energy between it and another small domain within the [[Demonweb Pits]], home of the other drow gods of the Dark Seldarine. This place was almost abandoned, however.<ref>\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] and the introduction of the [[World Axis cosmology]], Eilistraee's realm within Arvandor continued existing, even with the goddess' disappearance.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], which saw Eilistraee's return (''circa'' the 1480s DR),",

She aided them in hunting, swordcraft, and other practical matters of their everyday lives, in immediately useful ways.\n\nEilistraee's help could come in the form of direct action—and she was not unwilling to retaliate in protection of her followers, if the situation called for it Her hunting horn sounded to hearten her faithful and scare away dangerous creatures which threatened them. Her song, or her silvery radiance and silvery moths, guided drow who were lost in the darkness or in the Underdark to a safe place, or yet lightened childbirths that occurred in the dark, and hers was the force that brought a stag within the reach of hungry drow.\n\nLikewise, Eilistraee intervened when her people needed visible confort or emotional help. She could make them know that they were not alone, and that someone was watching over them, when they felt lost (usually through her own light, She could provide them with insight and inspiration to reach an important goal, or even lend her magic, if needed, to break any shackle preventing them from freely embracing the path they wanted to walk, or so that they didn't have to give themselves to Lolth in exchange for help when they felt overwhelmed (an example was the situation that saw her helping [[Liriel Baenre]] to heal her companion, [[Fyodor]], from a fatal wound). Furthermore, in the daily ritual known as the [[Church of Eilistraee#Evensong and Flamesong|Evensong]], Eilistraee would \"listen\" to the (usually) wordless messages of her followers as they let out the emotions, experiences, and reflections gathered during the day. After the Second Sundering, unlike many other deities. Eilistraee kept routinely interacting with mortals. She welcomed all who sought her help and had no ill intentions in her Court of the Dance in Svartalfheim. There, she listened to them and gave them advice, comfort, or material help such as healing, depending on what was required in the situation. She could even be persuaded to temporarily boost a person's abilities and prowess through her magic, but only if she deemed it an actual necessity and if she didn't think there could be negative consequences to it. Moreover, after having been betrayed and deceived in her past, she had become wary and careful in choosing of whom to gift with power.\n\nThe Dark Maiden sang her call to all dark elves—from the highest matron mother to the lowest male slave—sending them dreams or visions, showing them a different, better life, and the beauty of the world (especially when they were close to the surface). Lolth was powerless to stop these visions, as too much interference from two goddesses could easily bring a mortal's mind to insanity, and despite her continued efforts to suppress any knowledge of her daughter, the drow definitely came to \"feel\" the Dark Dancer at some point in their lives, with varying reactions. \n\nWhile many would either not understand their dreams and emotions, or chose to ignore, disbelieve, or reject them, many others secretly yearned for the goddess and all that she wished for them. In fact, it was not unusual for them—if they thought they could get away with it, without the knowledge of a priestess of Lolth—to choose to spare the life of a worshiper of Eilistraee, decline to tell other drow what they'd seen of their activities, or linger to watch one of their dances rather than breaking it up. That said, despite those feelings, not many drow could find the strength and resources to make the final step and leave their past behind to cleave to Eilistraee on their own.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 5812\n| postid     = 159733\n| whichpage  = 56\n| date       = 2006-11-05\n| accessdate = \n}} Furthermore, the Dark Maiden's efforts were opposed by the power of Lolth and the other evil drow gods, and what she could do was very limited.\n\nDespite her focus on the drow, Eilistraee took to heart the cause of aiding the needy wherever and whenever possible, no matter their race, gender, or strength. She believed in offering kindness, shelter, and acceptance to anyone not working evil, especially if outcasts. She and her church also worked to spread joy and merriment, and to bring confort and hope to those who were taken by sorrow. Finally, the Dark Maiden was, among the other things, a goddess of beauty; as such, she was known for her efforts to nurture and spread enthusiasm for arts—especially music and dance—and for blessing artists and bards with bursts of creativity and inspiration.",

Reynolds (October 2002), Drow social relationships, Wizards of the Coast]to thrive on the surface world, In fact, the clerics of Eilistraee, commonly known as [[Sword Dancer of Eilistraee|Sword Dancers]], acted as an extension of Eilistraee's own motherhood of the drow, and took the role of teachers, protectresses, and diplomats. The priestesses aided their people to learn to live and forge their own path in a hostile world, and to rediscover a sense of belonging and community. They also protected their people from danger, and built a place for them to live by establishing friendships and relationships with other races. The Eilistraeans were also known to offer aid and shelter to those who came asking them (no matter the race), and even to actively travel to other places in order to bring food, cures, arts, and practical help where there was need of it and to those met along the way.\n\nMany followers of Eilistraee, and especially her clerics, strove to learn and promote arts—with a soft spot for music and dance—as well as teaching them and passing along the knowledge of particular pieces, songs, or dances learned during travels or created by them. They would also take care of broken musical instruments, or craft new ones. Those who didn't know an art, were instead known to support bards by hiring them when they could afford it. This was part of their way to promote joy and merriment in their communities and during their travels.\n\nThat said, despite their efforts, the faithful of Eilistraee, were little known and poorly understood by inhabitants of both the Realms Above and the Underdark. Her worshipers were figures of myth and superstition and were targets of prejudice and wild mistruths. Some surface dwellers believed they were the disguised vanguard of the Spider Goddess's plan to take over the surface, while those drow who followed Lolth or other evil deities suspected them of being surface elf spies and saboteurs posing as drow as a prelude to invasion. Most non-elves could not comprehend the existence of a good drow deity, while surface elves were uncomfortable considering it, finding Eilistraee a threat to their doctrine that the dark elves were wholly to blame for the Crown Wars and other ancient tragedies.\n\nEilistraee was commonly worshiped in [[Cormanthor]] among the drow there, in the [[Dalelands]] among the [[half-elves]],<ref> in Waterdeep and [[Skullport]], She also had followers (mostly [[human]]s, elves, and half-elves) living in [[Silverymoon]] and its surroundings.

However, a more elaborate variant that entered common usage from [[1372 DR]] depicted a nude female drow with long hair, bearing a silver sword and dancing before the full moon. This symbol was still in use in the 1480s DR, after Eilistraee's return with the Second Sundering.",
        "History": {
            "Exile": "The commonly accepted version of the story or myth of how Eilistraee came to her role in the [[Dark Seldarine]] ran as follows.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-30000}}, ambitious and traitorous, envious of the authority that her consort Corellon had over the elven people, Araushnee (with the cooperation of her son, Vhaeraun) gathered a host of deities who were opposed to the Seldarine, tricking them into assaulting [[Arvandor]] in an attempt to overthrow Corellon.\n\nThe only deity of Arvandor who took steps to stop Araushnee's plan before it could unfold was [[Sehanine Moonbow]]. Through her connection to moonlight, she had in fact witnessed the Weaver crafting a [[scabbard]] meant for Corellon, imbued with cursed magic devised to bring defeat in battle to its owner. The item had been crafted by Araushnee before a meeting between Corellon and [[Gruumsh]] that was supposedly meant to establish the terms of a truce, but that in truth she had orchestrated with the orc god with the purpose of slaying her lover. This attempt was however a failure, and the sheath was lost in the battle, only to be later retrieved by Sehanine. The Lady of Dreams—-aware of Araushnee's betrayal, but knowing how important her love was to Corellon—tried to dissuade her from such madness, but the Weaver reacted violently, defeating and imprisoning the moon goddess with the aid of Vhaeraun. With the only meaningful obstacle out of their way, Araushnee and Vhaeraun proceeded with their plan, working to lead Eilistraee to find the cursed item. They exploited the Dark Maiden's adoration for her father, knowing that she would have been more than eager to search for the sheath, and overjoyed to return such a prized possession to him, making her the perfect scapegoat.\n\nWhen the attack began, Eilistraee (whose skills in archery, scouting, and hunting were widely known among the [[Seldarine]]) was the first to spot the threat, allowing her father and the other elven deities to prepare a defense. The Dark Maiden took part in the battle, enthusiastic and proud to be able to fight by her father's side in defense of their home. In the heat of the battle that ensued, when [[Ghaunadaur]] made its entrance, Corellon painfully realized that the threat had to have come from within the Seldarine itself, as a being like Ghaunadaur could only enter Arvandor if a true evil already lurked within the plane. His sorrow grew even more intense when he realized that his lover, Araushnee, was behind it, as she stood observing the battle in triumph. Seeing the distraction and shock of the elven lord, an [[ogre]] god took advantage of the situation and charged towards his position: he almost managed to end his life, but Eilistraee acted swiftly to defend her father, loosing an arrow at the charging ogre-god. The young goddess didn't know, however, that the scabbard that Araushnee had crafted for Corellon's sword was imbued with a curse which magically drew the shaft of the arrow, changing its path to instead pierce his chest. Seeing the scene from the skies, [[Aerdrie Faenya]], unaware of the deception, struck the still-shocked Eilistraee down, incapacitating her. Despite Corellon being almost fatally wounded, the battle was ultimately won by the forces of the Seldarine and, as soon as the last invader was driven from Arvandor, the elven deities—still unbelieving that the Dark Maiden could act against her father—gathered around the unconscious elven lord, trying to aid him and save his life.\n\nIt was then that Araushnee, faking grief, put in motion the second part of her plan (as she had intended for the invaders to be defeated). Pretending to do her best to save her lover, she tried to use a concoction of poisonous [[herb]]s, prepared by Eilistraee for the arrows of the mortal dark elves, to finish Corellon, passing it for a healing elixir made up of water from [[Elysium]] and healing herbs. She hoped that if her treachery was uncovered, she could still blame Eilistraee, as the potion had been her work. This plan didn't go well: [[Sehanine Moonbow]] had in fact managed to free herself, and intervened in time to save Corellon (together with Aerdrie Faenya and [[Hanali Celanil]], in the form of the triune goddess [[Angharradh]]) and free Eilistraee from guilt.\n\nAfter the elven lord regained consciousness and the truth was made clear, he had to take the painful decision to banish all the dark elven deities for their roles in the war against the Seldarine. Eilistraee was cleared from any wrongdoing, considered only an unwitting participant, but regardless she insisted upon this punishment: she foresaw that the dark elves would need a beacon of good within their reach and her help and support in the times to come. Reluctant yet proud, Corellon conceded her wish. \n\nAfter very nearly slaying her own father with a misplaced arrow, Eilistraee swore never to use ranged weaponry again, lest her missile go astray. Thereafter, the sword was the only weapon for her.",
            "Wandering": "After her exile, the Dark Maiden wandered [[Toril]], the same world that the elves had chosen as their home. For centuries, she fought Vhaeraun's corruption of the [[Ilythiiri]], thwarting his efforts to gain influence over all the dark elves of the south. Eilistraee had in fact foreseen that the influence of Vhaeraun (and of her mother, whom she knew would later come to Toril), would have led the [[elf|Tel'Quessir]] to war against each other, and she worked to prevent that.\n\nWhen Sharlario and Cornaith Moonflower traveled towards Ilythiir as representatives of the elves, to establish diplomatic ties with the dark elves there, Eilistraee personally appeared to both of them. The Dark Dancer came to seek friends in the two elves, and to warn them of the danger represented by Vhaeraun and his followers, and of the strife and conflict that they (and even darker deities) would have brought to the [[elf|People]]. Both elves offered to become her followers, to support the goddess in her struggle, but—although honored—Eilistraee kindly refused, as she only wanted the elves to be aware, and as she feared that soon her own people would become exiles like she was.\n\nEilistraee eventually managed to gain some followers in Ilythiir, Lolth's attention turned to the dark elves of Toril only later, when the moon elf [[Kethryllia Amarillis]] intruded into the [[Demonweb Pits]], reminding the Spider Queen of a way to regain more of her divinity by having the surface elves worship her again. Her power started to rise after the [[First Sundering]] and the death of many Vhaeraunites in the destruction of [[Atorrnash]],\n\nAfter dark and green elven refugees from [[Aryvandaar]] founded [[Miyeritar]] in {{Yearlink|-18800}}, the Dark Maiden's faith concentrated there, as the goddess became a major patroness of the nation, However, the following centuries inflicted blow after blow to Eilistraee and her followers. During the [[Crown Wars]] ({{Yearlink|-12000}} to {{Yearlink|-9000}}), she could only mitigate the growing control Lolth, Vhaeraun, and Ghaunadaur had over the dark elves. In {{Yearlink|-10500}}, the [[Dark Disaster]]—a magical cataclysm unleashed by the elves of [[Aryvandaar]]—caused the death of many of her people in [[Miyeritar]], severely weakening the goddess' power. Meanwhile, Lolth and Ghaunadaur gained great influence among the dark elves, culminating in {{Yearlink|-10000}}, when the Seldarine and the elves gathered at the [[Elven Court]] cursed and exiled all dark elves (including Eilistraee's followers), turning them into drow. This harsh punishment was motivated by the corruption that Lolth and the [[balor]] [[Wendonai]] were spreading among the noble houses of Ilythiir, and by the worship of Lolth that had begun to spread among the Ilythiiri. Ultimately, Eilistraee could not rival Lolth's power, and the Spider Queen became the major deity of the dark elves. After this event, Lolth's and Ghaunadaur's persecution of worshipers of rival deities further marginalized the influence of the Lady of the Dance for millennia.\n\nEilistraee found an unlikely protégé in her nephew-god, [[Selvetarm]]. He was the son of Vhaeraun and [[Zandilar the Dancer]] (who would later become one with [[Bast]], forming [[Sharess]]), but had spurned both his parents and walked alone for centuries, neither good nor evil. After Eilistraee found and befriended him, Selvetarm came to admire her goodness and appreciate her teachings, and the two grew close to each other. A hope was sparked in the Dark Maiden's heart: that her nephew could become an exemplar, and aid her in healing the rift between the dark elves and the Seldarine. However, said hope and friendship ended in the late 3rd century after [[Dalereckoning]], when Lolth tricked Selvetarm into slaying [[Zanassu]] (a [[demon lord]] whom Lolth considered her rival, as he claimed to have power over spiders), by promising him that doing so would gain him the admiration of the Dark Maiden. But Selvetarm was overwhelmed by the demonic essence and he fell wholly to evil, ending up as Lolth's champion. Spiteful Lolth did this to prevent her daughter gaining an ally among the Dark Seldarine.\n\nDespite all these setbacks, Eilistraee kept fighting to bring her hope to the drow and lead them back to their rightful place in the light. It was only in the centuries after [[Dalereckoning]] that her faith regained a degree of prominence in Faerûn.",
            "The Time of Troubles": "In [[1358 DR]], when all the deities of the various pantheons were forced to walk [[Toril]] in their mortal [[avatar]] forms by [[Ao]]'s decree (an event known as the [[Time of Troubles]], or the \"Avatar Crisis\"), Eilistraee too was affected. She appeared to mortals at least once during the Time of Troubles. The Lady of Dance manifested in the [[High Forest]], in the location that became known as [[Darkmaiden's Leap]], a site of pilgrimage sacred to her. The goddess ventured there to rescue a group of drow refugees and lead them to the safety of the temple of the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden|Promenade]].",
            "Post-Avatar Crisis": "During the 1360s DR, Eilistraee took to heart the young drow [[Liriel Baenre]] and her travels on the surface. While Lolth constantly tried to claim Liriel as her own chosen, Eilistraee kept subtly singing her call to the girl, guiding her and letting her channel her magic on multiple occasions, in order to help her find her own path.<ref> For example, the emotion of Eilistraee's dance, and that of her moon magic, helped Liriel to envision and create her personal rune to carve in the [[Yggdrasil's Child]]—the goal of her quest, that would have allowed her to preserve her drow magic (and therefore, to her, identity) on the surface, and [[Thorn]]—Eilistraee's own champion—assisted her in her travel to [[Rashemen]].<ref> All in all, Eilistraee spoke to Liriel's emotional side, providing her a sense of sisterhood, and reminding her of the beauty and joy that could be found in life.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Elaine Cunningham &lsqb;II&rsqb;\n| author     = [[Elaine Cunningham]]\n| topicid    = 13887\n| postid     = 497528\n| whichpage  = 31\n| date       = 2017-07-16\n| accessdate = \n}}\n\nAt the beginning of the 1370s DR, the cosmology rearranged under the [[World Tree]] model. After her millennia-long exile, Eilistraee was allowed to move her divine realm, and the souls of all her followers (including drow), back to [[Arvandor]]. She kept a small realm in the [[Demonweb Pits]], but it remained mostly empty, and Eilistraee herself very rarely visited it. It wasn't known whether moving from [[Ysgard]] to Arvandor happened out of material necessity, or was the first sign of her efforts towards reconciliation bearing results.{{speculation}}",
            "War of the Spider Queen": "In the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the goddess Lolth went into a state of hibernation, a period called the [[Silence of Lolth]], with [[Selvetarm]] protecting her, as part of a plan to increase her power and separate her divine realm, the [[Demonweb Pits]], from the [[Abyss]]. For about one year, she stopped granting spells to her followers and became effectively inactive. During this time, Lolth's absence led a considerable number of her followers to seek alternatives in the other deities of the [[Dark Seldarine]] and this resulted in Eilistraee gaining followers and influence. She chose one of her new converts, [[Halisstra Melarn]], to wield the artifact known as the ''[[Crescent Blade]]'', which could be used to kill Lolth before her awakening (in [[1373 DR]]). Halisstra went on a mission to the Demonweb Pits, leading two fellow priestesses of the Dark Maiden, [[Uluyara]] and [[Feliane]]. However, after being defeated at the hand of [[Quenthel Baenre]], Halisstra ultimately decided to betray Eilistraee and convert back to the awakened Lolth. The Spider Queen punished her former heresy by turning her into the ''Lady Penitent'', whose duty was to hunt drow who tried to turn to other faiths. The ''Crescent Blade'' was left broken, lying in the Demonweb Pits.<ref><ref><ref>\n\nEven after Lolth emerged from her Silence, the deities of the Dark Seldarine continued battling for supremacy over the drow or, in Eilistraee's case, to free them from Lolth's renewed grasp.\n\nLolth convinced Eilistraee to play a divine game of ''[[sava]]'', with the stakes being the players' lives and therefore the very fate of the drow. The Dark Maiden accepted, seeing an opportunity to finally end the torment that Lolth had been inflicting on the drow for millennia and to set her people free, and put herself on the line for them. After the end of the Silence, working on the Spider Queen's side, Selvetarm ordered his [[Drow Judicator|Judicators]] to initiate a series of attacks against the shrines and temples of Eilistraee. At the same time, [[Vhaeraun]] was plotting against his sister and working to devise a method to slay her. As a result, his worshipers planned to cast a [[Elven High Magic|High Magic]] spell to allow Vhaeraun to enter his sister's realm and assassinate her. However, that kind of magic was very taxing, and would have required the sacrifice of the souls of the casters. Because of that, the followers of the Masked Lord started to kill various priestesses of Eilistraee and collect their souls in their masks (a technique which they called \"soultheft\"), in order to use them as a fuel for the ritual.\n\nEventually, [[Qilué Veladorn]], leader of the [[church of Eilistraee]], managed to learn about their plan and started working to disrupt it, alongside the drow mage [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] (who had turned to the faith of Eilistraee). Q'arlynd's task was to take the place of one of the Vhaerunites and try to disrupt their ritual. Meanwhile, Eilistraee sought to recover the lost ''Crescent Blade''; to that purpose, [[Cavatina Xarann]], a [[Darksong Knight]] serving the Dark Dancer, went on a mission into the Demonweb Pits, where the sword was seen last.\n\nWith the Dark Maiden and her followers struggling against multiple fronts, Selvetarm made another move, trying to strike at the heart of his aunt's forces, as his followers attacked the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]]. However, his attempts ultimately failed: on [[Nightal 20]] of the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]], the defenders of the Promenade (led by Qilué) bested the assailants,\n\nOn the same date, Q'arlynd failed to accomplish his mission and Vhaeraun managed to enter his sister Eilistraee's realm and attempted to assassinate her. Despite that, the Dark Maiden did not receive her brother unprepared, as she had been warned by her priestesses about his intentions. No mortal actually witnessed the battle that ensued, so what happened remained largely unknown. However, Eilistraee emerged from the battle alive, suggesting that Vhaeraun had failed and perished at the hand of his sister. Chaos and despair spread among the followers of the Masked Lord, but some thought that their god was still alive, and that the twins had a plan and agreed to merge and work together against their mother for a time. Others were convinced that Vhaeraun had succeeded and was disguised as Eilistraee. Either way, it was certain that after the event, Eilistraee was changed: she held both her brother's and her own portfolios, she gained the title of \"Masked Lady\", and caused her followers and Vhaeraun's to cooperate, albeit uneasily.''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' explicitly says that Vhaeraun's assassination attempt failed and Eilistraee killed him. However, in [http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=19841&whichpage=22#476639 one of his answers], [[Ed Greenwood]] suggests that Eilistraee actually spared her brother's life. The Dark Maiden defeated Vhaeraun with the indirect help of her ally [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], as the [[Weave]] frustrated the Masked Lord's magic while enhancing Eilistraee's. The goddess temporarily took her brother's portfolio, and trapped his sentience in the Weave, where it was enfolded in a dream by Mystra. The Lady of Mysteries did that to ensure that the two drow siblings would survive the cataclysm that she knew was coming—the [[Spellplague]]—in which she would be \"killed\" to renew the Weave, and magic would go wild.\n\nIn the [[1377 DR|Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR]], [[Kiaransalee]] and her cultists initiated hostilities against the Masked Lady and her followers. Furthermore, the church of the Revenancer tried to call an army of [[undead]] from [[Death Heart]], a city on the [[Negative Energy Plane]], by feeding the ''[[faerzress]]'' with [[negative energy]]. As a byproduct, this increased the drow's urge to go back to the [[Underdark]], which clashed with the Dark Maiden's goal of leading her people back to the surface. Eilistraee answered to that through a High Magic ritual performed by Q'arlynd Melarn, which erased the demigoddess' name from the minds of every Torillian being, including Kiaransalee herself, leading to her disappearance. Her temple was also destroyed, and her followers' plan thwarted.\n\nFollowing those events, by Eilistraee's will, Qilué began helping Q'arlynd Melarn prepare a High Magic spell meant to sever the link between the faerzress and the drow who didn't worship Lolth, and make it easier to lead them away from the Underdark and to the surface. Meanwhile, Qilué also took possession of the Wendonai-possessed ''Crescent Blade'', and hatched a plan to kill the demon (whom Lolth had originally used to corrupt the drow into following her) by taking its essence into her and destroying it with Mystra's ''[[silver fire]]'' in the place where he had been summoned for the first time. If successful, she would have freed the drow from him, but in the time that it took her to prepare for the plan, his presence would affect and influence her.\n\nIn 1379 DR, [[Ghaunadaur]] joined the conflict between Lolth and Eilistraee, focusing his attention on the latter (who, through her chosen, had previously banished The Elder Eye's avatar from Toril). As a result, with the help of some traitors among the former Vhaeraunites who had joined the Masked Lady, his cultists managed to attack the Promenade. Their goal was to destroy the prison—guarded by the followers of Eilistraee—that prevented their god from creeping into Toril. The attempt failed, but the inhabitants of the temple, and the followers of the goddess who used the [[Church of Eilistraee#Portal Magic|Moonspring portals]] to aid them, suffered heavy losses.\n\nIn [[Flamerule]] of the [[1379 DR|Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR]], the High Magic spell that Q'arlynd Melarn and Qilué had prepared was cast with the intervention of Eilistraee (although the goddess would withdraw her presence early during the ritual). Qilué was supposed to be the main caster, but she had realized that she couldn't have taken part in the spell, for Wendonai's influence would have compromised it, and had assigned her role to Q'arlynd instead. Despite being meant to sever the link between the faerzress and the drow, the ritual also transformed hundreds among the followers of Eilistraee (who, as [[lesser deity]], had at least a few thousands of worshipers) and those drow who were not tainted by [[Wendonai]]'s blood, back to their original [[dark elf|dark elven]] form.<ref group=\"note\">Considering Eilistraee's ideals of acceptance, that—in over 10,000 years—Eilistraee never once acted or suggested the idea of such a change; and that her main goal was always to help the drow rediscover the kind of life that they had lost, and to establish them as rightful, non-evil citizens of the surface world, it could be that the goddess herself was opposed to the forceful transformation of her people. This would be further supported by her belief that the drow needed to find their own path in life, and her gentle and never direct approach in helping them in such endeavour (''[[Demihuman Deities]] p. 12 and 14''). It could explain why the spell—which saw her intervention—only affected a minority of her people and why, after the goddess' return, both she and her followers are still drow\n\nAt the same time, in order to enact the plan to destroy Wendonai, Qilué and her sister [[Laeral Silverhand]] traveled to the only place where such a task could be accomplished: the royal court of ancient [[Ilythiir]], where the balor had been summoned for the first time. Fearing that Qilué would lose her life in the ritual, Laeral froze her in time and went to seek help, but in the meantime the drow priestess was found by the Lady Penitent, who took hold of the ''Crescent Blade''. Eilistraee inhabited the body of her chosen to try to save her, free Halisstra's from Lolth's influence, and offer relief from torment. However, Wendonai tricked the Lady Penitent into killing Qilué and the goddess before that could happen, making her believe that the chosen and her deity were actually Lolth.<ref group=\"note\">In the [http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=19841&whichpage=22#476639 same answer] mentioned in the previous note, Ed Greenwood hints that Eilistraee actually managed to survive Halisstra's attempt to kill her, albeit much weakened. When Qilué Veladorn was killed, since the Masked Lady was inhabiting her body, a great part of her power was dragged into the [[Weave]] with the Chosen's soul (the souls of Mystra's chosen often become \"Voices in the Weave\" after their death, as explained in the novel [[Spellstorm (novel)|''Spellstorm'']], and their memories and experiences are shared by Mystra). After that, for about a century, Eilistraee could only manfest herself only as a floating black mask surrounded by moonlight, capable of silently communicating with mortals, but not of answering prayers or granting spells (except by direct touch). After Mystra and the Weave were completely restored in [[1487 DR]], the goddess of magic could finally give Eilistraee her own lost power, and do the same with Vhaeraun, after having awakened him from his dream. After that, the souls of the newly transformed [[dark elves]] among the faithful of Eilistraee were allowed by Corellon Larethian to enter [[Arvandor]] (even though Eilistraee's realm, which continued existing, had already been moved to Arvandor almost a decade before, alongside the souls of her followers within it). Despite Corellon's decision, Qilué's soul didn't go to his realm in Arvandor, and became a [[Weaveghost]] instead.{{cite web\n| url            = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1235039364763115522\n| title          = Ed Greenwood on Twitter\n| accessdate     = 2020-03-04\n| author         = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date           = 2020-03-04\n}}",

Furthermore, while Eilistraee's and Mystra's shared chosen, Qilué, remained a [[Weaveghost]], Eilistraee didn't want to give up on her, and made sure that her priestess had full access to her divine realm."
