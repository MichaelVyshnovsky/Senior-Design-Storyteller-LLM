'''Mahavidi''' was the [[Padhrasattva]] of Erudition within the [[Padhran religion]]. Mahavidi was considered to be the highest of the [[Padhra]]'s incarnations and was the personal Padhrasattva of the [[Dalai Lama]] of Ra-Khati.

==Holy Sites==
An enormous statue of Mahavidi made from pure [[gold]] and weighing over 30 tons (27 metric tons) was located within the [[Room of a Hundred and Three Pillars]] in the [[Potala]] of [[Saikhoi]].

==History==
In life, Mahavidi was a follower of the [[Padhra]] and one of those who achieved "eaum", or a state of enlightenment. He ascended to join the Padhra and become a padhrasttva.

The monks of the Potala believed Mahavidi had sent the spirited and aggressive [[horse]] [[Sandiraksiva]], the [[Black Courser]], to serve as a test of the Dalai Lama's wisdom and patience.
