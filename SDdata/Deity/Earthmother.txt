The Earthmother&mdashalso known as the Goddess&mdashwas a primal spirit venerated by the druids and Ffolks of the Moonshae Isles, who regarded her as the soul of the land and the guiding force in their lives.
The Earthmother was an aspect of Chauntea, although some of her worshipers refused to acknowledge it.
The Earthmothers life essence was directly connected to the Moonwell and the Moonshae isles. When Bhaal corrupted the Moonwell, turning it into the Darkwell and began to corrupt the isles, the Earthmothers strength began to fade. The God of Murder continued to suck at the warm life of the Moonshae isles until her spirit was completely extinguished, ending her reign on the isles.
The Earthmother directed several mortal servants, known as her "children". She granted them with powers far beyond the usual for their kindred.
* The Leviathan, a huge black-skinned whale.
* Kamerynn, an awakened Unicorn.
* The Pack, a gathering of all the wolves of the Isles led by the moorhound Canthus.
* The Torque of the Goddess were silver bands worn around the neck by worshipers of the Earthmother, which granted several benefits such as a protection against Lycanthropy.
* Moonwells were considered sacred by the Earthmother and her druids, and she could use them to observe the world.
