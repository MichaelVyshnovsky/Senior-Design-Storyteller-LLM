The '''Earthmother'''&mdash;also known as '''the Goddess'''&mdash;was a [[primal spirit]] venerated by the [[druid]]s and [[Ffolk]]s of the [[Moonshae Isles]], who regarded her as the [[soul]] of the land and the guiding force in their lives.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|59-61}}

The Earthmother was an [[aspect]] of [[Chauntea]],{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}} although some of her worshipers refused to acknowledge it.

The Earthmother's life essence was directly connected to the [[Moonwell]] and the Moonshae isles. When [[Bhaal]] corrupted the Moonwell, turning it into the Darkwell and began to corrupt the isles, the Earthmother's strength began to fade. The God of Murder continued to suck at the warm life of the Moonshae isles until her spirit was completely extinguished, ending her reign on the isles.

===Children===
The Earthmother directed several mortal servants, known as her "children". She granted them with powers far beyond the usual for their kindred.

* The [[Leviathan]], a huge black-skinned [[whale]].
* [[Kamerynn]], an awakened [[Unicorn]].
* [[The Pack]], a gathering of all the [[wolves]] of the Isles led by the [[moorhound]] [[Canthus]].

===Relics & Holy Places===
* The [[Torque of the Goddess]] were silver bands worn around the neck by worshipers of the Earthmother, which granted several benefits such as a protection against [[Lycanthropy]].

* [[Moonwell]]s were considered sacred by the Earthmother and her druids, and she could use them to observe the world.
