        "mainbody": "orthok the Thunder Boar was a primal spirit in service of the god Talos. It preferred to take the form of a massive giant boar.\nGorthok often appeared as a boar the size of an elephant with crackling electricity leaping between its tusks.\nGorthok was fearless and vicious. Although it honored the commands of any Talos faithful who summoned it, Gorthok cared about little other than destruction,\nIn its boar form, Gorthok was a tough and relentless beast whose tusks were charged with lightning and whose hooves roared with thunder. It was very hearty, taking a great deal of effort to subdue. Compounding this, it was resistant to most physical blows and was entirely immune to the effects of lightning and thunder.

During stormy weather, Taloss faithful could summon Gorthok to do their bidding. The anchorites of Talos based in Neverwinter Wood revered Gorthok and made use of its might.\nIn the late 15 century DR, three anchorites of Talos plotted to summon Gorthok at the Circle of Thunder"
