Once a day they could immediately cast a healing spell of the conjuration type at maximum effect.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the deathwatch, shield other, and detect thoughts spells. Clerics of some experience could cast discern lies, true seeing, and prying eyes. Those that were masters in this domain had access to guards and wards, teleport object, and foresight."
