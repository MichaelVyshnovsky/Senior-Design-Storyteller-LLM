        "mainbody": "lutoq was the Maztican god of stone and mountains.\nPlutoq appeared as a towering pillar of soil and stone some forty or fifty feet tall. He had green jade for eyes and spikes of obsidian for teeth.\nPlutoq was the youngest son of Kukul and Maztica. Like his brothers Azul and Tezca, he sided with Zaltec against Qotal.\nPlutoq was less popular than other gods in Maztica. He was only prayed to when fields were barren and prayers to Watil had failed, or when safe passage over the mountain areas above the tree line was sought. He had few priests, who dedicated themselves to working with stone, clay, or gems. Sacrifices to him took the form of shattering pottery or even jewelry on the ground."
