He was one of the [[Zakharan pantheon|eight Great Gods]] of the Land of Fate and preached the value of personal independence and self-reliance.\n\nHaku's symbol was a stylized gust of wind.\n\nIn tales he was described as a proud nomad garbed in flowing desert clothing, wearing a gleaming scimitar. Like other Zakharan gods he was above such concerns as alignment, as a noble [[desert rider]] may value independence as highly as a dark-hearted [[assassin]].",
