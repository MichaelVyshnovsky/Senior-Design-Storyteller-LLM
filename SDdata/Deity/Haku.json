He was one of the eight Great Gods of the Land of Fate and preached the value of personal independence and self-reliance.\nHakus symbol was a stylized gust of wind.\nIn tales he was described as a proud nomad garbed in flowing desert clothing, wearing a gleaming scimitar. Like other Zakharan gods he was above such concerns as alignment, as a noble desert rider may value independence as highly as a dark-hearted assassin.\nFree Haku had many worshipers among Al-Badia, the desert nomads of Zakhara. In the Cities of the Pantheon, however, his faith was persecuted.\nMain article CategoryTemples to Haku"
