'''Kiputytto''' was a demigoddess of disease and sister to [[Loviatar]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-07 - Loviatar & Talona}} She was slain by [[Talona]].

==Description==
Kiputytto was described as a black skinned, twisted old crone with a scarred face.

==Relationships==
For a time, Kiputytto was the lover of the god [[Bane]]. Their romance ended however when she realized he attempted to steal her divine power during their daliances.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-07-07/Kiputytto and Bane}}

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-33}} Kiputytto attacked Talona, a deity who shared a portfolio with hers. Their chosen battleground was city of [[Asram]], one of the four remaining cities of [[Netheril]]. Talona gained the upper hand by plaguing the city, forcing the inhabitants to pray to her. Kiputytto struck back with similar method, however her plagues overcame the curative resources of the city and left the population dead in less than a month. In the aftermath, Talona slew Kiputytto.

In the wake of the [[Second Sundering]], dead gods and forgotten pantheons sparked into the existence once again. Kiputytto was among those deities returned to life with the return of [[Mystra]], the Mother of All Magic. However, Kiputytto's new life was cut short as [[Moander]], the ancient deity of rot and corruption, devoured the goddess along with several other resurrected deities.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-14 - Moander vs Kiputytto}}
