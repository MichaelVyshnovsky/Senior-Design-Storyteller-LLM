The '''Mother Guardian of Groves''' was a mysterious deity that acted as a protector of copses and watersheds. The voice of the '''Green Goddess''' was heard in every babbling brook, her presence felt wherever there was calm.\n\n{{quote|''Who is Eldath? Eldath is a goddess. They call her the Quiet One. She's a healer, and she serves Silvanus and helps the druids of the Emerald Enclave.''|[[Cerril]]}}",
        "Description": "Eldath normally appeared in a {{SI|10|ft}} tall female form, but the details varied. Depictions in religious art and known appearances had her as a [[human]], [[wild elf]], [[sea elf]], [[dryad]], and [[nereid]]. She was tall, thin, graceful, beautiful, and her form was always translucent enough to be seen through at all times. Sometimes she was said to have dark hair while at others her hair was colorless like water, and seemed more like spun glass or flowing ice; as a dryad or wild elf, her hair was blue and green. Her eyes were a deep shade of green.\n\nEldath's feet were bare and her green, silken, shimmering garments clung to her form as they flowed, yet her appearance soothed rather than aroused lustful feelings.",
        "Personality": "Eldath was a pacifist who avoided hostile action, even if threatened. Although shy, quiet, and enigmatic, the Green Goddess was possessed of unknown depths of character and unexpressed resolve that could not be broken. Eldath protected rivers, streams, and druids' groves.",
        "Divine Realm": "Eldath's [[divine realm]] was called [[True Grove]]. In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], it was located in [[Eronia]], in the second layer of [[Elysium]].",
        "Powers": "The Mother of the Waters was regarded as a goddess of serenity, comfort, and healing. Any waters blessed by her were known to cure sickness and madness. They could also calm the dying giving them peace and a natural passing.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Gods of Nature.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A gathering of the gods of nature: [[Mielikki]] and her unicorn, [[Chauntea]], Eldath, and [[Silvanus]].'']]\nEldath considered [[Mielikki]] a sister and together with her she served [[Silvanus]] loyally, even if she did find him at times intimidating. She had close relationships with [[Chauntea]], [[Selûne]], and [[Lathander]], as they shared some common interests.\n\nAlthough Eldath was diametrically opposed to [[Tempus]], the Lord of Battles, they were not enemies.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Eldath's dogma was pacifistic, and her followers only resorted to violence in defense of themselves, of their friends and loved ones, and of pools and groves.",
            "Rituals": "[[Druid]]s of Eldath prayed for their [[evocation]]s once per day at a time selected after great personal reflection. The only [[Calendar of Harptos|calendar-related]] holy day of the church was the [[Greening]], a gathering and festival celebrated at [[Greengrass]]. It was preceded by [[Firstflow]], a festival held at varying times when the ice broke up and began to flow at the conclusion of winter.\n\nOfferings to Eldath were typically weapons broken so they could never be used again, or an item that caused an argument and so had to be discarded to promote peace.",
            "Temples": "''Main article: [[:Category:Temples to Eldath]]''\n\nMany rural communities had a designated pond or glade which served as a holy site for local parishioners. These places were traditionally used as places to reflect and meditate. Usually a body of water (either the pond itself or a stream near those glades considered holy sites) served as a repository for offerings to Eldath in connection with these holy places. If no water was nearby, a special tree or bush was designated as a repository on which offerings were tied to the branches."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to Bedine legend, the sun goddess [[At'ar]] was jealous of Eldath's beauty and imprisoned her at the oasis of [[Elah'zad]] in the [[Anauroch]] desert."
