He was also concerned with the skills of gnomes working as artisans and craftsmen of all kinds.",
        "Powers": "Flandal was physically strong, and no stranger to battle.",
        "Possessions": "Flandal had a [[Sentient item|sentient]] [[warhammer]] named ''[[Rhondang]]'' that,  among its many other abilities, could speak with all [[fire]]-using creatures.",
        "Activities": "Flandal would, rarely, send an [[avatar]] to instruct gnomes in some very tricky smithing process, or to guide them to untapped metal ores. He might also send an avatar to deal with any disputes between gnomes and fire-dwelling creatures.",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:Steelskin symbol.jpg|thumb|''The symbol of Flandal Steelskin.'']]\nFlandel Steelskin's church was organized similarly to a [[guild]] serving mostly as a forum to enable gnomes to improve their skills as craftsmen.  Most [[cleric|clergy]] were master smiths and were known for producing exceptional [[armor]] and weapons.  His priests prayed for spells at noon when the forge of the world was hottest.\n\nFlandel Steelskin's holy day was the High Forge celebrated on Midsummer day when the faithful gathered to sacrifice weapons and sing percussive hymns.\n\n[[Specialty priest]]s of Flandal were known as pyrosmiths.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Baervan Chikktika Flandal Segojan.jpg|thumb|''From left to right: [[Baervan Wildwanderer|Baervan]] and Chikktika, Flandal Steelskin, and [[Segojan Earthcaller]]''.|left]]\nHe helped forge [[Arumdina]], the intelligent [[battleaxe]] of [[Garl Glittergold]], so Flandal often had the pantheon leaders' ear as needed.\n\nFlandel was on good terms with the other gnomish deities with the exception of [[Urdlen]].  He also counted [[Gond]] and the [[good]] [[Alignment|aligned]] gods of the [[dwarven pantheon]] as allies.  He was opposed to the [[kobold]] pantheon as well as other humanoid deities."
