The Metal domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with metal-related spell powers.
They gained proficiency with a chosen kind of hammer weapon.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the magic weapon, heat metal, and keen edge spells. Clerics of some experience could cast rusting grasp, wall of iron, and blade barrier. Those that were masters of this domain had access to transmute metal to wood, iron body, and repel metal or stone.
