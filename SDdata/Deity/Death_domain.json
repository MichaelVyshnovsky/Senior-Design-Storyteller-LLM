        "mainbody": "'''Death domain''' was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with death-related [[spell]]s and powers.\n\n{{Quote|Death is too powerful a force for even a single god to contain. It is a duty that has been passed from hand to hand, splintered into smaller pieces - disease, war, funeral rites - but there must always be an overseer of the cycle as life falls away. For countless aeons, it was Jergal. The Lord of the End of Everything presided over mortality with his unblinking stare, until even he grew weary. Young Bhaal, Bane, and Myrkul must have thought themselves conquerors when they came for the god of death, yet he used their ambitions to free himself. Myrkul claimed primacy over death from Jergal's bargain, but even he does not rule death alone. What is murder if not the most violent of deaths, seized by Bhaal in his incessant greed? What need would there be for noble Kelemvor to judge passing souls, if one deity could hold the process entire? Even gods can die, after all. Those who worship death should remember that above all else.|''[[Death & Divinity: A Godly Guide]]'' that described the deities of death.}}",

        "Powers": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]], they gained the ability to kill a target instantly once per day, though the odds of success depend on both the strength of the cleric and the target.",
        "Spells": "Prior to the Spellplague, novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[death knell]]'', and ''[[animate dead]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[death ward (spell)|death ward]]'', ''[[slay living]]'', and ''[[create undead]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[destruction]]'', ''[[create greater undead]]'', and ''[[wail of the banshee]]''.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], clerics who chose this domain were granted free access to the following spells (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance). Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[false life]]'', ''[[ray of sickness]]'', ''[[blindness/deafness]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', and ''[[vampiric touch]]'' spells. Powerful clerics could cast ''[[blight]]'', ''[[death ward (spell)|death ward]]'' and ''[[antilife shell]]'', ''[[cloudkill]]''. In addition, Death domain clerics gained access to ''[[touch of death]]''."
