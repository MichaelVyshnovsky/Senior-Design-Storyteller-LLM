'''Ishtar''' was one of two [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric goddesses]] of love and war (the other was her progenitor, [[Inanna]]). She departed the world of [[Toril]] soon after [[Enlil]] did. In her place, she left her portfolio and the right to use her name and appearance to the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi goddess]] [[Isis]]. Her holy symbol was a female hand clutching a rod of blue crystal.

==Description==
Ishtar was portrayed as a beautiful [[human]] female with blond hair and blue eyes.

==Relationships==
Ishtar was born from the goddess [[Inanna]]. Once they were the same being, but as Inanna's people grew more civilized, her pantheon split in two, with new aspects of the older gods becoming entities in their own right.

==Realm==
Ishtar dwelled in the City of the Star on the first layer of [[Elysium]]. It was a star-shaped city filled with love, beauty, life, and joy made from white marble. It was said to be one of the most beautiful places in the multiverse.

==Dogma==
By merely existing, Ishtar brought life into being. Although she was a goddess of war, she advocated violence only when it furthered life.

Ishtar's followers were charged to aid the farmers of Unther and other common folk.

==History==
Ishtar presumedly came to [[Toril]] with the other Untheric deities aboard the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]''. She survived the [[Orcgate Wars]], but left Toril to rejoin her greater self in the cosmology from which she came shortly after Enlil did in {{Yearlink|-734}}. Isis continued to use her name and aspect after that date.
