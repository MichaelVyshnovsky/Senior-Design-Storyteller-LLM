Camazotz was a chaotic evil lesser deity of bats
Camazotz manifested as an enormous bat, and was never sighted without a thousand natural bats flocking about him.
An aspect of Zotzilaha took the form of a humanoid creature with the head and membranous wings of a monstrous bat, covered in coal-black fur. It had sharp fangs and wickedly hooked claws. Its eyes glowed orange and its body bore an aura of great heat.
If summoned, Camazotz might come if given an offering of countless insects for himself and his bat followers to feed on. This could be achieved with an insect plague spell. As Zotzilaha, he would often send his aspect to his shrines as a demonstration of his might and wrath.
Camazoz was capable of the psionic power id insinuation.
An aspect of Zotzilaha could see clearly in any kind of darkness, even magical deeper darkness, and could speak with all bats and bat-like creatures. It could summon up to a dozen dire bats once a day. One infused with volcanic heat could breath a gout of unholy flame, burn those it clawed and those who touched it. It was immune to fire, as well as to paralysis, poison, and sonic energy, but vulnerable to cold. It could also summon fire bats instead.
Camazotz fought with his claws and fangs, and both inflicted a paralyzing venom. No weapon would harm him while he was in darkness.
Similarly, an aspect of Zotzilaha inflicted feverish tremors on those it harmed with its claws or bite. Its long arms gave it shocking long reach in battle.
