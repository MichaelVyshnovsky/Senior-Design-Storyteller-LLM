She was infinitely loyal to anyone she took into her trust, never abandoning a worshiper in need, and when no choice remained but to fight she proved an intractable and ruthless opponent.{{Cite dragon/307/Prestige Classes for Cultists of Good Monsters|76}} and those who took risk to save a unicorn might receive a boon from her.<ref> Nothing brought her more sorrow than the existence of [[black unicorn]]s, creations of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] using [[fiend]]ish blood, and she sought a method of redeeming their corrupted souls.",

        "Realm": "Lurue was a goddess of the [[Material Plane]]<ref> and freely wandered Faer没n, often in the region around [[Silverymoon]]. She also freely roamed [[Karasuthra]], the 1{{st}} layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], and the [[House of Nature]] of the [[World Tree cosmology]] despite having no realms there. There was some indication that, at least for a time, she was preparing a realm beyond the Material Plane in order to move relatively closer to Nobanion.",
        "Activities": "Lurue was said to dance above the motes of the [[Moonbridge]] in Silverymoon (but only if there was no more than one observer) and occasionally appeared in a sacred grove known as the [[Place of the Unicorn]] northeast of [[Leilon]].\n\nLurue led the Silver Herd on spirited runs as well as thunderous stampedes in defense of her devout worshipers. Normally a ghostly charge was enough to scare antagonists off, but the herd would fight until the enemy was driven away. Were the entire herd to be dispatched, each member immediately evaporating into morning dew, Lurue did not surrender or leave the worshiper, instead calling upon the other nature deities for aid before soldifying and fighting with no quarter.",
        "Relationships": "Lurue, like her colleagues [[Gwaeron Windstrom]] and [[Shiallia]], both of whom she worked closely with, was allied to and a servant of Mielikki, and thus by extension a servant of [[Silvanus]], She was more than a mere mount upon which Mielikki rode when needed (such as into battle), but a close and perhaps lifelong friend.\n\nIt was said that Silverymoon's mother was [[Sel没ne]], the Faer没nian goddess of the moon itself, but her father was often debated. Some believed she was related to [[Kamerynn]] the Unicorn, one of [[Chauntea]]'s children of the [[Moonshaes]]. Those from other [[crystal sphere]]s meanwhile attempted to link her to [[Eachthighern]], a male [[power]] of unicorns and pegasi not usually worshiped on Toril if at all, citing him as the father of Lurue and her younger sister Yathaghera.<ref> Lurue herself claimed no relation Eachthighern, reacting only with confusion to his name, although notably some scholars believed Kamerynn to simply be an avatar of Eachthighern. Lurue was believed to have at least one direct descendent in the form of the particularly noble stallion that led the Silver Herd.\n\nLurue counted on the help of other nature deities in times of crisis. who she considered a friend, She had a similarly positive relationship with the elven moon goddess [[Sehanine]] and the like-minded [[Aerdrie]].<ref> Lurue was also an ally and close friend of [[Nobanion]], their deep bond having lasted for centuries, such to the point that she was the one the Lion King counted on most when he needed an outside perspective or comfort in times of stress and sadness.\n\nLurue's only personal foe was the Beastlord [[Malar]], whom she detested and opposed at every opportunity. She blamed him for secretly contributing to the creation of the abominable black unicorns which brought her such sadness, while Malar considered her a prized quarry and would be more than happy to rip her apart.",
        "Worshipers": {

        "History": {
            "The Silver Pool": "[[File:Katerina Ladon-Corrupted Avatar of Lurue 5E.png|thumb|right|250px|A corrupted [[avatar]] of Lurue.]]\nIn [[374 DR]], before the region that would later become Silverymoon was settled, a hallowed site associated with Lurue known as the [[Pool of Eternal Spring]] was being corrupted by the forces of Malar. The Beast Lord sought dominance over the forest, particularly the area around the pool, and his agents had been brutally slaughering animals as tribute and casting the bodies into its waters. The climax of this desecration was to summon a corrupted avatar of Lurue to serve Malar's ends in his new domain, an act he believed would demonstrate his dominion like no other.\n\nTainted by Malar's influence, the summoned avatar was wicked and sought to carry out his will by killing anything that dared to come upon it. Necrotic energy danced at the tip of its black horn as it rampaged against those who came to stop it and even those that created it. This all ended when a jagged stroke of white lightning from the moon itself struck the unicorn, an act of divine intervention speculated to be a courtesy of Selune, who was waiting until the peak of Malar's plan to foil it and so show him the utter futility of trying to claim the forest. Lurue's avatar thus purified, she gave a thankful nod to those who fought to help her before setting to work.\n\nHer horn now cleansed of corruption, the avatar dipped it into the pool, which was restored to its original, pure and silvery state. The cleansing continued down an outlet stream to remove any trace of corruption that may have escaped into the current. Her work finished, Lurue galloped through the night, freed from Malar's threat, and as a way to show her gratitude and ensure Malar would never try this again she allowed the silvery spring flow to continue. The pool became the [[Pool of Eternal Silver]], and its waters would be forever protected by her grace. Silverymoon would later be named as such in honor of this tale.",
            "Humanoid Attention": "Lurue's faith was personal and direct, and it was only when she began attracting human followers that her nature and religion were recorded, or even broadly noticed.\n\nIt was in the year [[627 DR]] that [[Ecamane Truesilver]] and his nine apprentices arrived in Silverymoon, claiming five goddesses, one of which was Lurue, drew them there.  Later he would pen the [[Lore of Lurue]] at the goddess's behest, an enchanted storybook telling of the origins of Silverymoon that eventually made its way to [[Candlekeep]] after his death in [[712 DR]].\n\nLurue's location during the [[Time of Troubles]] was unclear, although it might be able to be deduced.{{cite web/The Avatar Trilogy: The Gods Walk Toril}} In [[1368 DR]], a divine entity with an unclear connection to Lurue was sent to the [[Great Dale]] to combat the influence of the [[Rotting Man]]."

        "Rumors and Legends": "It was said that were Lurue ever to lose her Argent Alicorn then all Faer没n would perish, [[Ches 19|spring]] lost forever to an eternal [[Nightal 20|winter]].\n\nIt was rumored that [[Alustriel Silverhand]] planned to raise a [[mythal]] over Silverymoon, which was conceptually called \"Myth Lurue\".{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 5}}"
