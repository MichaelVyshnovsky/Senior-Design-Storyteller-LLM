The '''Queen of Air and Darkness''' was a powerful [[archfey]] who ruled over the [[Unseelie Court]].

==Description==
The Queen of Air and Darkness had no physical form; her presence was merely felt in the Unseelie Court. If magic was used to see her, however, she appeared as a beautiful but terrible female faerie with angular features, bone-white skin, all-black eyes, and long black hair.

<!--==Personality==
==Abilities==-->
==Possessions==
The [[Black Diamond]], sometimes called the Night Diamond, was an [[artifact]] of immense power and evil of unknown origin. It sat atop her throne in the Unseelie Court.

==Divine Realm==
The Queen of Air and Darkness ruled over the [[Unseelie Court]], the divine realm of the fey pantheon of the same name, which accounts variously placed as being either in [[Phlegethon]] in [[Pandemonium]] or in the [[Feywild|Plane of Faerie]].

<!--==Activities==-->
==Relationships==
The Queen of Air and Darkness reigned over the Unseelie Court, the foes of the [[Seelie Court]]. She was opposed by the elven deities of [[Seldarine]], namely [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]], [[Solonor Thelandira]], and [[Angharradh]]. To them, she personified the corruption that could grow even in those of fey lineage.<ref>

[[Auril]] the Frostmaiden was believed to be synonymous with the Queen of Air and Darkness by some communities of fey, such as those of the Shiverpine Forest in the [[Deep Wilds]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|60}}<ref group="note">In this [https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1228370295649599488 tweet], [[Ed Greenwood]] agrees that the Queen of Air and Darkness was impersonating Auril, with Auril's support, to gain more followers on Toril.

==Worshipers==
She was served by unseelie fey, including [[bramble]]s, [[quickling]]s, She was also known to have a fondness for [[yeth hound]]s and [[hell hound]]s.

The [[gloura]]s, fey beings of the [[Underdark]], had ties to the Queen of Air and Darkness and the Unseelie Court.

==History==
Once, the Queen of Air and Darkness was the sister of Queen [[Titania]], ruler of the fey, in the land of [[Ladinion]]. But one day a group of [[dwarves]], who had been mining in a mountain to the south, brought to the Seelie Court a great, ten-faceted black [[diamond]] they had found as a gift for the fey queen. However, Titania was away swimming that day so her sister accepted the gift. This diamond began to corrupt her, transforming her nature, and one day she took the diamond and other magical treasures and left in a chariot of smoke and fire that was said to have appeared out of the sky. Some time later the mountain that the dwarves were mining exploded, slaying the dwarves and causing sickening smoke to cover the land.<ref name=MM(2)">
