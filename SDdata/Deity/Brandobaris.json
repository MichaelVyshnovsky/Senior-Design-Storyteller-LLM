        "mainbody": "'''Brandobaris''' ({{Pronounce|BRAN|do|BAIR|iss|refs=|primary stress=3}}) was the [[halfling]] [[deity]] of [[rogue|thievery]] and an [[exarch]] of [[Sheela Peryroyl]] in the late 1400s DR. He was the misapprehensions of halflings held by most races in divine form. He was constantly scheming and meddling, as he was curious and with a short attention span. Where the tall races would put more interest in one's purse than his character, Brandobaris cared for character more.",
        "Relationships": "Brandobaris had a good relationship with [[Tymora]], which was likely the reason for his luck. Brandobaris also got on well with the rest of his pantheon. The other way around, however, was not the case. [[Garl Glittergold]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], Tymora, and Brandobaris formed an informal group of mischief, which sometimes worked on the nerves of more serious gods, such as [[Helm]]. [[Vergadain]], [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], and [[Quorlinn]] enjoyed his friendship as well.\n\nBrandobaris had few enemies, as his charm and wits allowed him to escape from trouble.",
        "Worshipers": "Brandobaris' worshipers were usually [[lightfoot halfling]]s who shared his curiosity. His stories were often adored by children who were raised with the stories of his exploits. [[Strongheart halfling]] communities often discouraged his worship as it was associated with an undisciplined lifestyle and thievery. [[Ghostwise halfling]]s saw him as a perversion of civilized society.",
        "History": "Brandobaris played a role in the creation of [[Luiren]], the halfling realm. Stories go that he tricked an [[ogre]] in a series of challenges after which he won the land for the halfling race.\n\nFurthermore, there are stories about him tricking [[dragon]]s and escaping from hordes of [[devil]]s with bags of their treasure. His greatest tale would likely be how he snuck into [[Myrkul]]'s Bone Citadel to save thousands of innocents and left a vase of flowers in return and some erotically shaped chocolate candies."
