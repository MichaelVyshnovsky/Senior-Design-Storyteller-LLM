        "mainbody": "The Water domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with water-related spells and powers.\nThe spellcaster gained the ability to turn away and destroy fire creatures the way a good cleric turned undead, and to rebuke, command, and strengthen water creatures the way an evil cleric rebuked undead.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the obscuring mist, fog cloud, and water breathing spells. Clerics of some experience could cast control water, ice storm, and cone of cold. Those that were masters of this domain had access to acid fog, horrid wilting, and elemental swarm (but for water elementals only)."
