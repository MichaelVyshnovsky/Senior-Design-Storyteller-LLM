Jikoku was a spirit who was guardian of eastern Wa. He was one of the Eight Million Gods.
He appeared as a powerful warrior clad in golden armor, wielding sword or spear and mounted upon a demonic steed.
The sacred Summer Temple of Jikoku once stood in the coastal village of Dyogo, a residential suburb of Uwaji. However, on a holy day for Jikoku in Wa Year 1676 (1258 DR), when over a hundred priests and acolytes gathered in the temple with their valuable offerings, the Great Earthquake struck Wa and the whole of Dyogo sunk into the sea, the Summer Temple with it.
