Shu was the god of wind in the Pharaonic pantheon.
The Upholder appeared as a strong and handsome male human with slightly blueish skin, with winds blowing about him all the time. He was in complete control of air and everything related to that element.
Shus divine realm named Desert Wind was located in the Elemental Plane of Air not far from the border towards the Paraelemental Plane of Smoke. It was a region of warm winds smelling of cinnamon and sand, crossed by beams of sunlight and glittering motes, all of which were Shus petitioners manifest. Intruders trying to enter the realm against the will of its master were kept out by scalding heat.
Shu was the loyal son of Ra, and fathered Geb (the earth) and Nut (the sky) with his sister-wife Tefnut. As the embodiment of the atmosphere, he held his two children apart by the command of Ra to prevent them from having more offspring after the birth of Isis, Set, Osiris, and Nephthys.
When the Pharaonic deities were asked by Ao through the intervention of Ptah to assist their worshipers who had been abducted by the Imaskari to Toril, Shu stayed behind together with Tefnut, Nut, at the command of Ra.
Shu was a cousin of the deity Seker.
