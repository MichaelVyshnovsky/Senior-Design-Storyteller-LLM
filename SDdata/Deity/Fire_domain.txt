The Fire domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with fire-related spells and powers.
The spellcaster gained the ability to turn away and destroy water creatures the way a good cleric turned undead, and to rebuke, command, and strengthen fire creatures the way an evil cleric rebuked undead.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the burning hands, produce flame, and resist energy spells. Clerics of some experience could cast wall of fire, fire shield, and fire seeds. Those that were masters of this domain had access to fire storm, incendiary cloud, and elemental swarm.
