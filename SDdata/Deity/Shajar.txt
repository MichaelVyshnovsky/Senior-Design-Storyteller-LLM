Shajar was the savage god of the Nogaro River in east Zakhara, depicted with the head of a hippopotamus, and was the consort of Ragarra.
Largely forgotten after the fall of the ancient kingdom of Nog and the rise of Enlightenment, his worship was continued by secret cults scattered throughout the Cities of the Ancients area. As the embodiment of the great Nogaro, Shajar represented both its benevolent, life-giving qualities and the destructive character present during the rivers recurring floods. Thus the deity was called upon at births and deaths.
The greatest relic of his cult was the Talisman of Shajar.
