His monstrous features however did little if any to detract from his aura of civility and overall mesmerizing physique.<ref name= \"FAII\"/>",
        "Personality": "Greatly confident, mesmerizing in personality,<ref name= \"FAII\"/> and said to be incredibly vain, Belial delighted in the use of manipulation and domination.<ref name= \"FAII\"/> He was a profane being of great lust with an insatiable hunger for physical pleasure and pain, as fond of killing and the feeling of hot blood against his skin as he was in traditional debauchery and gratification.\n\nDespite his deep passions, Belial was also intelligent and experienced, not so rash as to become so caught up in his amusements that he didn't take proper precautions and prepare contingencies. The old devil was of shrewd judgement and cunning political prowess which, along with his good looks, aided him in his ambitious, diabolical machinations. He was also of glib tongue, always coming off as civil even despite the threatening, underlying messages that could be found in some of his words.",
        "Powers": "Several of Belial's abilities were as archetypically infernal as his appearance and personality; his magic could [[produce flame]]s and create [[wall of fire|walls of fire]] as well as [[beguile]] and make his enemies prone to [[suggestion]]. His more powerful abilities allowed him to mentally [[dominate monster|dominate]] his foes, instill [[fear]] with his gaze or in an aura around himself, and create [[Symbol of pain|symbols of pain]] and [[symbol of insanity|insanity]], and he used these abilities to scatter his enemies and turn them on each other.\n\nHe was far more patient than Fierna when it came to combat, always casting spells such as [[magic circle]] and [[see invisibility]] before the fight began. He could summon baatezu ranging in power from [[spinagon]]s, [[black abishai]], [[barbazu]]s, [[hamatula]]s, and [[cornugon]]s, all the way up to summoning a [[pit fiend]]. Only once his summon or summons, typically a pit fiend, were distracting his opponents and only when his opposition was disorganized, weak, and quarreling would he move in and allow the pleasure of melee blood-spilling begin.",
        "Possessions": "Belial's ransuer, or [[military fork]], was his favored, iconic weapon, and wasn't any regular [[polearm]]. It was a minor artifact that filled those it struck with wracking pain, slowing them down as their bodies and minds dealt with the agony and said to be powerful enough that a [[heal]] or [[break enchantment]] spell was needed to fully recover from the crippling torment.",
        "Realm": {
            "Society": "Belial ruled his realm and its inhabitants from the city of [[Abriymoch]], the Mount of Leaping Flames, a fortress city built on the interior walls of a volcano reported to be in varying stages of activity. Abriymoch was the strongest stronghold in the middle hells, protected by [[legion devil]]s, fearsome [[osyluth]] policers and thousands of hamatulas. It was constructed of [[obsidian]] and crystalline rocks, basalt towers crowning the lips of the crater. The rest consisted of several tiered chambers that each opened up to the central shaft of the volcano like balconies and were connected to each other via stairs, shafts, and the giant spiral path that winded through the inside.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|26}} Wealth from transactions was also stored there but Belial's personal wealth was kept in his personal chambers high on the volcano's rim.\n\nAbryimoch was something of a paradox, although an excellent parallel to the rest of Hell regardless. On one hand, it was something of a pleasure palace, a carnival of dark desires filled with infernal reflections of casinos, theaters, taverns and other similar establishments where devils on break could enjoy themselves. On the other hand, it was extremely well-policed, the laws allowing for fiendish fun rather than strict regimentation but order nonetheless being strongly enforced. After all, it was the home of the Court Infernal or Diabolic Courts, an impossibly complex labyrinth of confusing precedents, ancient codes, intricate laws and plentiful loopholes presided over by a circle of pit fiend judges. Belial himself didn't actually live in Abriymoch, instead spending most of his time in a serpentine spiral of crystal typically referred to as his daughter's palace."
        },
        "Activities": "In more recent times, Belial focused on the duties as the lord of Phlegethos, specifically overseeing the judicial system of the Diabolical Court. Though independent judges loyal to Asmodeus were in charge of the institution, responsible for overseeing contract disputes, accusations of battlefield cowardice and dereliction of duty, and other criminal charges, Belial still supervised the system. He and his underlings were also the ones that administered promotion and demotion rituals for devils, a procedure that could leave the subject in wretched torment or in the throes of ecstasy. Aside from that, Belial's personal concerns revolved around his own scheming to overtake Stygia and indulging in his lusts. Though Fierna had a greater reputation for thoughtlessly going through men, Belial was no better, frequently sating his needs with captives, slaves or other devils.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Archdevils": "[[File:Belial and Fierna.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Belial alongside Fierna'']]\nBelial's daughter was, for some time, the nominal ruler of Phlegethos, the Lord of Pain and Suffering having stepped down after the Reckoning to avoid punishment while putting his daughter in his place.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|4-5}} Some believed that Fierna was simply a puppet ruler that Belial manipulated while ruling from the shadows{{Cite dragon/360/Infernal Aristocracy: The Dukes of Hell|46-48}} while others thought Belial was soon to fade into obscurity as his kin replaced him, and both were wrong.\n\nFierna was just as capable a politician as her father and the two commonly discussed strategies, it was just that she had little interest in taking part in the convoluted web that was the Baatorian government. She perpetuated the rumor that she was simply Belial's mouthpiece out of convenience, but both ruled Phlegethos together, bound as they were by blood and politics, even before it was officially allowed by Asmodeus. Belial was capable of focusing her fiery rage and acted as her guide in the \"arts of love and pain\" from within the Hall of One Thousand Sighs and Screams in her palace.\n\nAs for the other archdevils, Belial wasn't particularly liked by most of his peers. He had a strong hatred of the archdevils above and below him, [[Mammon]]'s machinations restricting his mobility and [[Geryon]] being his mostly fiercely despised nemesis, although [[Moloch]] was a close second in terms of loathing. In this respect, the Reckoning worked out fairly well for him, ridding him of both Geryon and Moloch and leaving Mammon cursed with a serpent form he despised. The most disappointing aspect of the Reckoning for him was that [[Levistus]], another old devil and a worthy opponent, was put in place of Geryon, though he had little fear of the [[Hag Countess]].\n\nThis was before Glasya replaced Malagard, uprooting all his plans and forcing him to wait due to his daughter's own positive relations with her and her status as Asmodeus's daughter. Belial's only notable ally besides Fierna was [[Baalzebul]], an alliance that managed to survive the Reckoning even if it was more of a secret. Belial would come to Baalzebul's aid if needed and vice versa, assuming the Lord of the Flies could find some advantage in doing so, although doing so would likely provoke [[Mephistopheles]]. The Lord of Hellfire would probably try to use Belial's daughter against him, preferably as an ally and failing that as a hostage, although Baalzebul was more concerned with her as a threat to him and Belial's alliance given her relationship with Glasya.",
            "Dukes": "Fierna's mother and Belial's consort was the late [[Naome]], an astute and well-liked devil with a light sense of humor, appreciated for her level-headedness and ability to bargain. Like the rest of her family she enjoyed a good fight, battling with both spells and a long [[scimitar]].\n\nAfter Belial stepped down and put Fierna in his place, his court was heavily divided as to where to put their loyalties. The Black Duke [[Bathym]], so called due to his jet-black armor, foreswore his former master in favor of Fierna along with the powerful pit fiend [[Zapan]]. Meanwhile, other devils stayed loyal, the most obvious example being the boisterous [[Balan]]. A reckless devil with tactics like that of a [[demon]], Balan's [[law]]fulness as explained by himself was to bring the absolute order found in death. He was cruel, lustful, violent and belligerent, only avoiding fights if facing a superior foe, although despite this behavior and being seldom appreciated by anyone around him, he was still given command over forty companies of barbazus, having stayed with the lord who had long helped him sate his terrible desires.\n\nAlso still loyal to his master was [[Gaziel]], an osyluth-like fiend given command over eleven companies of the same devil type. Cold and mechanical, though strangely savage when a particular fight caught his interest, Gaziel was in most respects a perfect general for his master. Belial's legate was Chamo, a polite and calm but nonetheless abrupt devil said to know every hiding spot in Phlegethos. Even before the Reckoning [[Chamo]] was reported to have plans to overtake Belial and he showed specific loyalty to neither him nor Fierna. His deputy was the pit fiend [[Zaebos]], who was also Belial's lieutenant and given permission to speak to the Lord of the Fourth's vassals on his behalf. Also of note was the pit fiend [[Gazra]], leader of the Abriymoch patrol force and Fierna's aide despite technically being more beholden to Belial. The pit fiend held a hateful jealousy towards Belial and desired affection from his daugther, but managed to keep such feelings hidden."

        "Worshipers": {
            "Aspects": "Aspects of Belial loved to participate in the finer things in life; they enjoyed fine fortresses and mansions even more than fiery surroundings and surrounded themselves with beautiful servitors, devilish or otherwise, to sate their rampant lusts. They wore elegant and expensive garments and kept gold to pay mortals when needed, not that they weren't willing to simply steal what they wanted given Belial's recent losses. Any society that offered extreme pleasures, whether in the Hells or on the [[Material Plane]], attracted them, and they were known to throw wild parties that resulted in the corruption and death of the young and wealthy. Though they tried to avoid melee, they had no other method of self-defense, and resorted to focusing on one enemy with their ranseur once forced to fight.<ref name= \"FAII\"/>\n\nOccasionally he sent aspects to Faerun, typically doing so in the past to keep track of Fierna's fledgling cults while fostering new cults of his own.<ref name= \"FAII\"/>"
        },
        "History": "Belial had long been the ruler of Phlegethos, although his exact age was debatable. He was old enough to regard Levistus, who himself rivaled the likes of the ancient Dispater in age, as a worthy adversary given that he was a \"devil of the old school\". Despite his hatred for Moloch, he allied with Baalzebul during the Reckoning, and was in fact the devil who officially kickstarted it. Though he had made moves to broker peace, it was ultimately under his orders that the Lord of the First moved against that of the Second. \n\nFollowing the Reckoning, Belial was demoted while Fierna took up the mantle of rulership, although it was he himself who suggested this. Though this could be seen as a cowardly move, and indeed it was a ploy to sate Asmodeus's wrath and get him to target other archdevils, Fierna was fine with the situation, at least until [[Glasya]]'s ascension to rulership of [[Malbolge]].\n\nBelial had been met with a series of setbacks ever since the Reckoning. His plans to take [[Stygia]] from the new lord of the Fifth were stymied after Levistus was put in charge and his Gazra-led legions were swiftly decimated. He focused on trying to outmaneuver the Frozen Prince politically for a time before once again attempting to assemble armies against him, confident that he would be able to defeat him and then perhaps the Hag Countess shortly afterwards.\n\nBut it was Glasya's surprising rise to power that proved, if not the most detrimental, the most life-altering for him. Fierna saw a kindred spirit in Glasya and the Princess of Hell could be considered her \"best friend\", at least as much as devils could have them. At Glasya's urging and in imitation of her close companion, she had begun growing interested in ruling Phlegethos in more than name, calling herself an archduchess, creating her own cults and devil networks, and introducing new initiatives to her father.\n\nAs much as he would try to hide it, his daughter's newfound ambition struck sweaty terror in the old Lord of the Fourth, for even as Fierna claimed she simply wanted knowledge on rulership if something happened to him, he was firmly of the mind that any untimely death would be at her command. Belial, for his part, attempted to keep tabs on his daughter's behavior without provoking her to greater autonomy, even putting many of his schemes against [[Levistus]] on hold while considering various actions against Glasya to make her a less appealing role model for Fierna. He was fully aware that the line he trod was thin, however, as any obvious strikes against Asmodeus's daughter could not only inspire his own progeny to rebellion, but be construed as moves against Asmodeus himself.\n\nIf Glasya was attempting to drive father and daughter apart to force some final confrontation between them however, the results were debatably successful. The two had managed to reconcile their differences and completely rework their family dynamic publicly ruling Phlegethos as a team. Fierna participated in the \"family business\", by managing their soul quota, something she proved to be far superior to her father in, while Belial handled the administration and other \"work\" to which Fierna was apathetic. Calling the two partners wasn't exactly accurate however, as they showed a confusing combination of hate, respect, rivalry and companionship all at the same time. They constantly made moves against each other, although not so much as to be a dangerously exploitable weakness, Belial's greater experience countering Fierna's superior glibness.",
        "Rumors and Legends": {
            "Naome": "The death of Naome was another point of contention in diabolical gossip circles. Although it was once reported that Asmodeus destroyed Naome as punishment for the Reckoning, another theory put forth that she died before it had truly begun. Naome had never been particularly fond of Glasya and had potentially called out her nefarious scheme to start the Reckoning. She wisely suggested to Belial to ease the tensions between groups, but before the archdevils could be united by their common foe in the [[Abyss]], Glasya, according to the rumors, assassinated her, prompting incensed Belial to begin the civil war for Hell."
