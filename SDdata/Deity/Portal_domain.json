        "mainbody": "The Portal domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to magic portals. They gained the ability to sense nearby portals, regardless of said portals activity.\nA priest with this domain could identify a portal, whether or active or inactive, the same way others would find a secret door.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the summon monster I, analyze portal, and dimensional anchor spells. Clerics of some experience could cast dimension door, teleport, and banishment. Those that were masters of this domain had access to etherealness, dimensional lock, and gate.Originally giving maze, this was exchanged for dimensional lock in Players Guide to Faer√ªn for v.3.5.\nA priest of the Underdark with this domain had an alternative suite of spells. \nNovice spellcasters were able to use the portal stabilization, analyze portal, and portal view spells. Clerics of some experience could cast dimension door, portal barricade, and portal-to-portal redirect. Those that were masters of this domain had access to etherealness, portal reformat, and gate."
