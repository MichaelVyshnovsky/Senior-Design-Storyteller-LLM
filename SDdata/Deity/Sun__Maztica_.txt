The Sun was a great spirit of the folklore and myth of the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin of northern Maztica.
The Sun, along with Sussistinako, was one of the original spirits. It was believed by the Azuposi that each of these beings was somehow the parent of the other. The pair created the land that would become the Pasocada Basin out of the primeval ocean.
