The '''Sun''' was a great [[spirit]] of the folklore and myth of the [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]] of northern [[Maztica]].

==History==
The Sun, along with [[Sus'sistinako]], was one of the original spirits. It was believed by the Azuposi that each of these beings was somehow the parent of the other. The pair created the land that would become the Pasocada Basin out of the primeval ocean.
