        "Description": {
            "Manifestations": "The will of Thoth was often communicated through the actions and appearance of constructs, [[golem]]s, and animals such as monkeys or water birds. He often drew the attention of his followers to important information through the call of an ibis or visual illumination. Engineering marvels in [[Mulhorand]] were marked by the holy symbol of Thoth in some part of their construction, signifying that the King of Knowledge was pleased by such work."
        },
        "Powers": "Thoth used [[arcane]] and [[divine]] spells with equal ease, and always cast spells deftly and efficiently. Thoth possessed the ability to fly at will and could negate magical effects as he chose. He could control any [[construct]]s in his vicinity.",
        "Possessions": "His quarterstaff was almost always close at hand. Thoth's ''Staff of Office'' was both a powerful artifact and a repository of ancient magic Thoth could draw upon. Those struck by his staff faced instant death.",
        "Relationships": "Thoth was an elder member of the Mulhorandi pantheon, and considered [[Horus-Re]], [[Isis]], and [[Osiris]] to be close allies. He also forged favorable relationships with [[Azuth]], [[Deneir]], [[Gond]], Oghma, [[Mystra]], and [[Savras]]. Only [[Set]] and his followers were seen as true enemies of Thoth, though he was known to intervene in the actions of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] as well.\n\nThoth felt indifference towards the rest of [[Faerun]]'s deities of magic. Unlike Isis he held no strong feelings towards the [[Shadow Weave]], viewing it simply as a foreign tool for magic and nothing more.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Church of Thoth": "[[Image:Priest of Thoth.jpg|right|150px|thumb|A [[cleric|priestess]] of '''Thoth'''.<ref>]]Clergy in the church of Thoth were typically Mulan belonging to the [[House of Tholaunt]], a house composed of mortal descendants of incarnations of Thoth himself. These individuals devoted much of their time to continual research and study, as well as spreading the knowledge obtained in this way to the people of Mulhorand.\n\nThe center of the church of Thoth was the [[Arcanum of Magic]], located in the city of [[Gheldaneth]]. Temples dedicated to Thoth typically served as the libraries and centers of learning of Mulhorand. These structures often incorporated and showcased grand feats of engineering and foreign knowledge in their design.",
            "Orders": {
                "[[Order of the Ibis Feather]]": "These elite scribes directly served the [[pharaoh]] of Mulhorand.",
                "[[Brothers and Sisters of the Quill]]": "These priests and wizards were charged with retrieving and protecting the secrets of their nation in the lands beyond Mulhorand's border."
            },
            "Celebrations": {
                "Ceremony of Introspection": "To symbolize their dedication to pure understanding, the clergy of Thoth fasted and bathed in cold water on the days of the summer and winter solstices."
            }
        },
        "History": "Thoth and [[Oghma]] were engaged in friendly competition to determine who could gain the most followers in the nation of Unther.\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]], Thoth and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of [[demigod]]s and led the [[Mulhorand]]i uprising against the [[Imaskari]], in a manner similar to how the [[Chosen]] manifested in other regions. As of [[1489 DR]], Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people."
