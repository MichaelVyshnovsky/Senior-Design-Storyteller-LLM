        "Personality": "Nangnang was greedy, selfish, and cruel, She refused to share with others.",
        "Abilities": "She was only weakly able to grant miracles to her [[cleric]]s, forcing her to cull her clergy and demand sacrifices to grant her power.\n\nHer spirit could inhabit and share the body of another individual, allowing her to speak to her host and imparting parts of her personality and power to them. The host gained the ability to climb across vertical and even upside-down surfaces with ease.",
        "Relationships": "Among her fellow trickster gods, Nangnang was enemies with [[Shagambi]].\n\nShe hated [[Acererak]] for killing and imprisoning her, and was eager to take revenge against him.",

She was venerated with the construction of shrines, the conducting of great rituals, and the killing of live sacrifices.",
            "As a Death Goddess": "Somewhere in a clearing along the [[River Tiryki]], a chamber with walls lined with skulls was constructed belowground and dedicated to the veneration of a grim and heavily altered aspect of Nangnang. This version of her was a goddess of cruelty and death, and was depicted with a distended belly and a skull for a head. Followers at this site crafted idols of her from [[onyx]] inset with [[rubies]],{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|8}}"

        "History": "Nangnang and the other eight trickster spirits came to be worshiped in Omu sometime in the 13{{th}} century DR, and for nine decades, she was a cruel and divisive deity.\n\nWith the arrival of Acererak in Omu in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Nangnang and her fellow trickster gods were killed and their spirits were entombed within Acererak's [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. Her spirit was bound into a ''[[pearl of power]]'' shaped like a petrified grung [[egg]], and she could possess any creature that touched this object. The ''pearl'' was placed in an [[urn]] alongside Nangnang's physical bones, which was in turn placed inside a [[sarcophagus]] on the second level of the Tomb that was guarded by an [[Invisibility|invisible]] [[gray slaad]].\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, she was still worshiped by grungs across Chult, including in the village of [[Dungrunglung]] and in a colony that dwelt on the roof of her shrine in Omu. Concurrent with the events of the [[Death Curse]], Dungrunglung's king&mdash;[[Groak]]&mdash;aspired to summon Nangnang via a great ritual, in which he hoped to wed her. He commanded his followers to erect a {{SIAdj|60|foot|long=yes|adj=tall}} statue of her out of painted mudbrick, and made it clear that heads would roll if the ritual failed. Suspecting that it could not succeed, the priest [[Krr'ook]] hatched a plan to fool the king with the use of ''[[Nolzur's marvelous pigments]]''.\n\nAround the same time, a party of [[Lords' Alliance]] members led by [[Arreni Goldbirth]] discovered the chamber dedicated to Nangnang's death god aspect, and soon fell prey to its undead occupants, transforming into [[wight]]s."
