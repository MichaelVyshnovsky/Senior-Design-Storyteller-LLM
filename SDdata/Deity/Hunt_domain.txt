==Powers==
Clerics of this domain were made as capable as most [[ranger]]s at finding and following tracks.

==Spells==
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could navigate themselves almost anywhere by ''[[commune with nature]]'', ''[[discern location]]'', ''[[locate creature]]'', and ''[[find the path]]''. They could prepare for any predator or prey with ''[[foresight]]'' and ''[[snare]]''. If forced to evade an enemy the priest could always ''[[hide from animals]]'' or ''[[control weather]]''. And if forced to confront their enemy, a priest could give themselves ''[[bear's endurance]]''.
