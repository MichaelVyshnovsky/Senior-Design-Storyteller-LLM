            "Manifestations": "The will of Horus-Re could be communicated through the actions of animals such as hawks or creatures such as [[solar]]s and [[lammasu]]. [[The sun]] represented Horus-Re in the day, and a [[meteor|shooting star]] signified his presence at night. The sky darkened if a follower failed to carry out the will of the Lord of the Sun, while a thunder clap was a sign of Horus-Re's favor. It was said the sun would go dark if Set usurped Horus-Re's position. The eye of Horus-Re was often signified by a circling hawk, and the cry of a hawk signified the fitting punishment of a criminal."

        "Powers": "Horus-Re was able to project a ray of damaging light from his eye.",
        "Possessions": "Horus-Re rode the airborne galley ''[[Matet]]'' (or ''Semktet'') and carried a glowing [[ankh]]. His ankh had the ability to destroy undead, and he wielded the ''[[Sword of Horus]]'' in battle.",
        "Relationships": {
            "Worshipers": "Worship of Horus-Re was most likely among nobles and the elite of Mulhorandi society. Most individuals serving in a government position considered themselves a follower of the Pharaoh of the Gods.\n\nClerics of Horus-Re typically wore white [[linen]] skirts and [[sandal]]s. Some wore wigs over shaved heads, topped by a headdress. Like all priests of Mulhorand, they painted three circles on their forehead to symbolize their divine calling. They might don false beards for official occasions.\n\nWhen the clergy of Horus-Re prepared for combat, they selected equipment practical to the situation. They preferred light armor, and always wore some form of headdress.\n\nClerics of Horus-Re prayed for spells as part of the Zenith Aspirant, when the sun was at its highest point in the sky."

        "History": "Horus was originally a young deity that often sided with [[Anhur]] in pressing change to his father, Re.\n\nDuring the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari, it was Horus that slew [[Yuvaraj|Lord Artificer Yuvaraj]] in {{yearlink|-2488}}.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerun|61}} When Re was defeated by [[Gruumsh]] during the [[Orcgate Wars]], the failing deity passed his powers and domain to Horus before passing on. Upon gaining this power Horus became Horus-Re, and began exhibiting the personality traits and beliefs of his dead father.\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]], Horus returned as a separate entity from Re along with other deities from the pantheon in the form of [[demigod]]s and led the [[Mulhorand]]i uprising against the [[Imaskari]], in a manner similar to how the [[Chosen]] manifested in other regions. As of [[1489 DR]], Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people."
