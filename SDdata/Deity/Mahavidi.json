Mahavidi was considered to be the highest of the Padhras incarnations and was the personal Padhrasattva of the Dalai Lama of Ra-Khati.\nAn enormous statue of Mahavidi made from pure gold and weighing over 30 tons (27 metric tons) was located within the Room of a Hundred and Three Pillars in the Potala of Saikhoi.\nIn life, Mahavidi was a follower of the Padhra and one of those who achieved \"eaum\", or a state of enlightenment. He ascended to join the Padhra and become a padhrasttva.\nThe monks of the Potala believed Mahavidi had sent the spirited and aggressive horse Sandiraksiva, the Black Courser, to serve as a test of the Dalai Lamas wisdom and patience."
