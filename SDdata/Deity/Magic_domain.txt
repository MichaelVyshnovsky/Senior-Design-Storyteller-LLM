The '''Magic  domain''' was a deity domain that granted [[divine]] spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and powers related to [[magic]] itself.

==Powers==
The priest gained the ability to use [[scroll]]s, [[wand]]s, [[rod]]s, and similar [[magic item]]s normally meant for [[wizard]]s, albeit at a lower power.

==Spells==
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could at first alter a magic item's aura with ''[[Nystul's undetectable aura]]'' and study magic items with ''[[identify]]''. Later, they could use ''[[dispel magic]]'' and give spells to another with ''[[imbue with spell ability]]''. At more advanced levels, they could protect against magic with 
''[[spell resistance]]'', ''[[antimagic field]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', and ''[[protection from spells]]''. Finally, the mightiest could use ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'' to both dispel magic and nullify magic items.
