The Magic  domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to magic itself.
The priest gained the ability to use scrolls, wands, rods, and similar magic items normally meant for wizards, albeit at a lower power.
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could at first alter a magic items aura with Nystuls undetectable aura and study magic items with identify. Later, they could use dispel magic and give spells to another with imbue with spell ability. At more advanced levels, they could protect against magic with 
spell resistance, antimagic field, spell turning, and protection from spells. Finally, the mightiest could use Mordenkainens disjunction to both dispel magic and nullify magic items.
