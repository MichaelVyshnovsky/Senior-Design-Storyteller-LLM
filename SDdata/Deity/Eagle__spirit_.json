        "mainbody": "Eagle was a deity and animal spirit worshiped by the green elves of Evermeet.\nHis role was to bestow good fortune but also to bring omens of impending catastrophes. The spirit appeared as a giant black eagle, and sometimes as a giant warrior visible in the clouds. His gaze could be lightning and his voice thunder.\nLike the other nature spirits venerated by the Sy-tel-quessir, Eagle served the pantheon of the Seldarine, and specifically Rillifane Rallathil to the degree that he was considered an aspect of the Leaflord.\nEagles priests worked for the common good and tried to achieve good fortune for their community.\nNext to the green elves of Toril, this powerful spirit was also worshiped under the name of Thunder by the Native American peoples of Earth."
