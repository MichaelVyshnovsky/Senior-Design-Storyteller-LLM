However, those shamans that worshiped her could call upon the horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves once each day, summon reindeer to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a reindeer twice each tenday.\nAdditionally, iceguardians who revered the Reindeer Mother alongside Ulutiu also could call upon the horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves once each day."
