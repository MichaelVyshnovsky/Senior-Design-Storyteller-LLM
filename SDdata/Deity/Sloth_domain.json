        "mainbody": "he Sloth domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers related to laziness and indolence. Those with the Sloth domain felt close to their deities when they were relaxing or simply lazing around.\nPriests with the Sloth domain were just as difficult to hit when they were lying on the ground as when they were standing and ready for combat.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the touch of fatigue, unseen servant, and deep slumber spells. Clerics of some experience could cast slow, symbol of sleep, and waves of fatigue. Those that were masters of this domain had access to shadow walk, waves of exhaustion, and astral projection."
