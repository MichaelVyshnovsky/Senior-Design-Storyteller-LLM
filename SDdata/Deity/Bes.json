        "mainbody": "'''Bes''' was the [[Pharaonic pantheon|Pharaonic]] and [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] deity of luck and chance, as well as protector of women in childbirth. Over time, his presence on [[Toril]] dwindled, and his aspect ended up subsumed by the [[Morndinsamman|dwarven]] deity [[Vergadain]].",
        "Description": "In his natural form, Bes appeared as a {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} tall figure, likened to either a [[shield dwarf]] or a stunted [[human]], with a powerful physique and bowlegs. His face, which was described as so ugly that it could scare evil spirits away, featured a bushy beard. He typically wore a [[panther]] skin with the tail still attached, although some accounts said that he had a tail himself.",
        "Personality": "Bes was a whimsical deity who liked gambling and small children. He didn't take the moral and ethical stances of those he blessed with good fortune into account, and the Short Father was childlike in his enjoyment of his worshipers' tributed offers.",
        "Abilities": "Bes was able to shapeshift and turn invisible.\n\nThe deity also had supernatural senses. He could see, hear, touch, and smell within a {{SI|7|mi|k|long=yes}} radius, and could decide to do the same within a {{SI|6|mi|k|long=yes}} radius around any of his worshipers, holy sites, artifacts, or locales where he was mentioned within the previous hour. He had a particular sensitivity to women in labor, games of chance, and musical performances attended by large crowds, and could sense them even if they fell outside of his normal range of perception.",
        "Possessions": "Bes wielded a ''[[dancing weapon|dancing]] [[luck blade]]'' that never missed.",
        "Activities": "As he had no realm of his own, Bes wandered the [[Outlands]], exerting influence over the laws of fate. He made frequent use of his shapeshifting abilities in order to covertly check in on all manner of creatures, especially those taking part in some sort of gamble. The Short Father was known to grant ''[[stone of good luck|stones of good luck]]'' to and tip the scales in favor of those gambling with particularly high stakes, though those that get too careless typically received no assistance from him.",
        "Relationships": "Bes shared his interests in music and luck with his wife, [[Hathor]].\n\n[[Ptah]] sometimes appeared and acted similarly to Bes, namely as a misshapen dwarf who protected against evil, but there seemed to be no direct relation between the two deities.{{Cite imagine/16/The Mythology of Ancient Egypt|21}}\n\nThe [[human]] [[thief]] Amenemhab acted as a [[proxy]] to Bes.\n\nOutside of the Mulhorandi pantheon, some sages thought that Bes had a close relationship with the [[Outlands]]-based members of the Morndinsamman, particularly Vergadain. His standing with the other deities that governed luck was unclear, though it was widely reckoned that he was mistrustful towards them.",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:Bes symbol.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The holy symbol of Bes.]]Bes was mainly worshiped by those who wished for luck, particularly gamblers, who curse his name just as often as they bless it. [[Adventurer|Adventuring]] [[rogue]]s, [[bard]]s, and [[illusionist]]s also often looked to him as their patron. Despite his dwarven appearance, he was more popular with [[halfling]]s and [[gnome]]s than with the Stout Folk.\n\n[[Cleric]]s devoted to Bes were often considered disreputable tricksters that avoided responsibility. They were not considered to be part of the priestly caste, and thus were not obligated to the dress code common to Pharaonic clerics, and thus generally dressed like the common people. Most of Bes's clergy was male. Their weapon of choice was the [[khopesh]].\n\nBes had no temples dedicated to him and did not have formally outlined rituals of worship. Rather, he was revered at household and roadway shrines, as well as gambling halls and taverns. It was common practice among followers of the Pharaonic pantheon to keep statues in Bes's image to keep bad luck at bay.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Bes's worship in [[Faer√ªn]] had largely become obscure, though he was still invoked by [[human]] merchants from [[Skuld]].\n\nAs a deity of luck, Bes was worshiped by many members of the [[Xaositects]].",
        "History": "Prior to joining the Pharaonic pantheon by marrying Hathor, Bes was part of a different pantheon, with which he subsequently lost all contact.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-2489}}, Bes was part of the group of deities under [[Ra]] who sent ''[[manifestation]]s'' to [[Realmspace]] in order to combat the oppression of the [[Mulan]] in [[Imaskar]], which led to the creation of the Mulhorandi pantheon. Long before the 14{{th}} century DR, however, Bes's diminished Realmsian aspect was subsumed by his close friend, Vergadain.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that, when an infant smiled for no apparent reason, it was actually doing so because only it could see the otherwise invisible Bes pulling faces.",
        "Trivia": "Bes was a common female name among the [[Shaaran]]s. In [[Elvish]] names, the prefix \"bes-\" meant \"oath\"."
