        "mainbody": "Divine domains were a specific areas of interest for deities, particularly to do with the magic and spells granted to their faithful. Clerics of a particular deity choose two of the deitys domains to focus upon, and gained access to extra spells within those domains. A deity could have as many or as few domains as it pleases, although it was usual to have at least four. \nA cleric must conform to the alignments of the Evil and Good, or Chaos and Law domains in order to focus on these domains, even if they belong to their deitys portfolio."
