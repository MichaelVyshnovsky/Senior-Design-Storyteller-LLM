        "mainbody": "Divine domains''' were a specific areas of interest for [[deities]], particularly to do with the magic and spells granted to their faithful. [[Cleric]]s of a particular deity choose two of the deity's domains to focus upon, and gained access to extra spells within those domains. A deity could have as many or as few domains as it pleases, although it was usual to have at least four. \n\nA cleric must conform to the alignments of the [[evil domain|Evil]] and [[good domain|Good]], or [[chaos domain|Chaos]] and [[Law domain]]s in order to focus on these domains, even if they belong to their deity's [[portfolio]]."
