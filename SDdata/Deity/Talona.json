        "Description": "Talona appeared as a gaunt, {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} [[human]] female with long, unkempt hair and reaching, elongated fingers. Her depictions in religious texts portrayed her as a withered crone with a scarred, tattooed face. The bodies of her [[avatar]]s seemed like they had been beautiful and voluptuous at one point, but their frames and charms had been ravaged by the march of time, horrific diseases, and starvation. Even so, Talona's dancing movements were said to be alluring, and her lips were nonetheless inviting and gentle.\n\nTalona was also sometimes depicted as a beautiful and innocent woman.",
        "Personality": "Talona was a strange goddess in terms of personality. She had been compared by sages to a greedy and petulant child, switching between the juvenile desire for attention at any cost to the aloofness of a discarded paramour. Curiously for a deity so closely tied to death, she had no personal taste for violence.",
        "Divine Realm": "Talona's realm was known as the [[Palace of Poison Tears|Palace of Poison Tears.]] Under the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], it was located in the jungle-covered orbs of [[Cathrys]], [[Carceri]]'s second layer, known for its poisonous vegetation.<ref>\n\nUnder the [[World Tree cosmology]], this realm was located in the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]].",
        "Relationships": "Prior to the Time of Troubles, Talona was a servant of [[Bhaal]] and had a heated rivalry with her fellow servant [[Loviatar]]. During that time she was often teased and tormented by her. Mocked for her appearance, the size of her portfolio, and her small number of followers. She would occasionally provide aid to adventurers of good alignments if she viewed their goals as something that would damage Loviatar's reputation.\n\n''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], she developed an alliance with the deity [[Shar]].\n\nShe despised [[Chauntea]], [[Mielikki]], [[Kelemvor]], and [[Tyr]].",

        },
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-33}}, a [[demipower]] named [[Kiputytto]], sister of Loviatar,{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-07 - Loviatar & Talona}} tried to challenge Talona for her [[portfolio]]. The conflict that ensued devastated the nation of [[Asram]] with terrible plagues, forcing its citizens to provide Talona devotional power in hopes that she would lessen the plague's effects. Talona ultimately won the conflict and shortly afterwards murdered Kiputytto. In the years that followed, texts would be written that referred to the latter deity as an alias of hers, further cementing Kiputytto's defeat.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], a formula to the concoction known as the [[Chaos Curse]] was indirectly given to the evil [[wizard]] [[Aballister Bonaduce]] by an avatar of Talona.<ref>[[R.A. Salvatore]] (October 1991). ''[[Canticle]]''. ([[TSR, Inc.]]). ISBN 1-5607-6119-9/0-7869-1604-4."
