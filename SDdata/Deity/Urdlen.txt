'''Urdlen''' ({{Pronounce|URD|len|refs=}}), also known as '''the Crawler Below''', was a [[chaotic evil]] [[gnome]] [[deity]]. It took the form of a white mole, blind, hairless, sexless, but with claws of steel. A mindless force of [[evil]] and destruction, Urdlen was the only evil [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnome deity]]. It was allowed to remain part of that pantheon by its leader [[Garl Glittergold]] as a reminder to all gnomes of the dangers of greed and bloodlust.

==Relationships==
Urdlen hated all the other [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnomish deities]], and they had no particular love for it either. Its actions also earned the wrath of the gods of [[Halfling pantheon|halflings]], [[Morndinsamman|dwarves]], and [[Kurtulmak|kobolds]], as well as [[Grumbar]].

==Worshipers==
[[File:Urdlen symbol.jpg|thumb|''Symbol of Urdlen.'']]
Worship of Urdlen was limited to either secretive cults or a lurking threat on the margins of society. Its [[cleric]]s waged war on the clergy of other gnome deities, or spent their time stealing works of art and other objects of great value and destroying or defacing them.

Some [[tanar'ri]] [[priest]]s were known to pledge themselves to Urdlen's service.

===Dogma===
Urdlen insisted that all living things had to be killed, and that all things created by the living had to be destroyed. It exhorted its followers to hate, covet, ruin, and destroy; to succumb to bloodlust; to revel in orgies of destruction and exult in killing. It claimed the strong would survive and subjugate the weak, and demanded that its followers appease it so it would not come to them.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, nobles of [[Arabel]] found themselves in a conflict with the [[cultists of Urdlen]]. The conflict was stated to had been prolonged according to the reporting on the pages of the ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazette.''
