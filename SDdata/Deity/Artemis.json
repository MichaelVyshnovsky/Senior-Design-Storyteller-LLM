        "mainbody": "'''Artemis''' ({{Pronounce|AR|teh|miss|refs =\n}}) was a multispheric interloper [[deity]] of hunting,There were no known worshipers of Artemis in the Realms. She is featured on this wiki due to her mentions in the adventures ''A Friendly Wager'' and ''Experience Preferred, Part One''.",
        "Description": "The [[avatar]]s of Artemis typically appeared in the form of a slim, or [[dryad]]<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Sizes\">Artemis is detailed in the cited source as being size \"Huge\", which in 3{{rd}} and 3.5 was classified as anything between {{SIrange|16|32|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "The Huntress was wild at heart, favoring the untamed wilds of nature and holding disdain towards civilization and its various trappings. As was common amongst the Olympians, she was also arrogant, refusing to acknowledge a better in her chosen field. And much like her half-sister [[w:c:planescape:Athena|Athena]], Artemis was sworn to eternal chastity. Over the years she rebuffed all attempts to woo her, preferring a life without a lover.",
        "Abilities": "As a deity Artemis possessed a wide array of abilities. These included various divine immunities, being able to cast ''[[animal friendship]]'' fifteen times per day, cast ''[[Command|command]] or rebuke plants'' fifteen times per day, cast ''[[greater turning]]'' fifteen times per day, ''[[plane shift]]'' at will, ''[[teleport without error]]'' at will, ''[[speak with animals]]'' or ''[[speak with plants|plants]]'' at will, and ''[[shape change]]'' or [[wild shape]] into any size of animal, including [[dire animal]]s, and remain in that form for six days. She could also wild shape into an [[elemental]], but only remain in that form for a period of three days. When transformed into an animal, her body was ''[[haste]]d'' as if by the [[spell]] of the same name. Some spoke of more fantastical abilities, claiming her avatar was impervious to harm from spells, or reflected them back at their caster, and having absolute power over all animals of the forest, with the exception of those that were [[magical beast]]s. \n\nUniquely, she was among the few Olympians immune to the lust-inducing powers of the Olympian [[w:c:planescape:Aphrodite|Aphrodite]].<ref><ref>\n\nThe Huntress's senses of hearing, sight, smell, and touch extended out as far as {{SI|15|mile|long=yes}}. Like other deities she could perceive anything occurring within {{SI|15|mile}} of objects and sites sacred to her, worshipers, and any location where her name or one of her many titles had been spoken within the prior hour. Being a goddess of the hunt and wild beasts, she could sense any act of hunting or any act affecting wild beasts, and could retain that sensation for fifteen weeks. She could divide her senses between up to ten places at a time.\n\nThe Huntress was capable of creating magical bows, arrows, [[quiver]]s, and swords. As well as ''[[boots of elvenkind|boots]]'' and ''[[cloak of elvenkind|cloaks of elvenkind]]'', ''[[bracers of archery]]'', ''[[ring of animal friendship|rings of animal friendship]]'', ''[[staff of the woodlands|staves of the woodlands]]'', and ''[[sylvan scimitar]]s''.\n\nArtemis also had a wide variety of spell-like abilities that her avatar form could cast, deriving from the [[sphere]]s of [[all sphere|all]], [[animal sphere|animal]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[elemental sphere|elemental]], [[healing sphere|healing]], [[plant sphere|plant]], and [[weather sphere|weather]]. Some of these spells included the following:\n: ''[[aid]]'', ''[[animal shapes]]'', ''[[antilife shell]]'', ''[[barkskin]]'', ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[calm animals]]'', ''[[changestaff]]'', ''[[command plants]]'', ''[[commune with nature]]'', ''[[control plants]]'', ''[[creeping doom]]'', ''[[dispel evil]]'', ''[[dominate animal]]'', ''[[endure elements]]'' (cold or fire only), ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[fire seeds]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[heat metal]]'', ''[[hold animal]]'', ''[[holy aura]]'', ''[[holy smite]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[magic circle against evil]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[repel vermin]]'', ''[[repel wood]]'', ''[[searing light]]'', ''[[shambler]]'', ''[[shapechange]]'', ''[[summon monster IX]]'' (good only), ''[[sunbeam]]'', ''[[sunburst]]'', and ''[[wall of thorns]]''.",
        "Possessions": "As an expert archer, the avatars of Artemis wielded either an [[enchanted]] ''+3 [[bow]]'' and ''+2 [[arrow]]s'', that she could expertly fire as far as {{SI|1000|yard|long=yes}}, or ''+5 arrows'' and a ''+5 [[composite longbow]]'' with the qualities ''[[mighty]] and ''[[speed]]''. Other weapons included a [[poison]]ed slim ''+3 [[dagger]] and a ''+5 [[keen]] [[short sword]]''.",
        "Activities": "Artemis spent much of her time hunting in Olympus, chasing down all manner of beast. She utilized loud hunting calls, earning her the moniker \"noisy Artemis\", but was otherwise quite stealthy. The Huntress would never engage in the activity for purposeless sport. She always hunted to feed herself or someone else, or to cull animals that were unbalancing their ecosystem by gaining a slight upper hand.",
        "History": "Artemis was born alongside her twin brother [[Apollo]] by the [[Greater Titan]] [[Leto]] and [[Zeus]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/153/The Goals of the Gods|17}}\n\nIn a land that consisted of a [[Wikipedia:Ancient Greece|collection of city-states]],{{Cite dragon/58/Four myths from Greece|21}} the same land that some early planar immigrants to [[Toril]] would later hail from, Artemis alongside her twin brother taught the man known as [[Chiron]] the arts of hunting and medicine, whose fame and skill in those fields became revered by deities and mortals alike over time.\n\nAt some point a group of [[adventurer]]s on Toril came to the island of [[Achea]] and ascended it, bringing them into the plane of Olympus. The Olympian Hermes took notice of them and decided to have a bit of fun, disguising himself as a wizened shepherd and making up a backstory that Artemis sentenced him to forever wander Olympus after he mistended his flock.\n\nAt another point, an adventuring company from Toril called the [[Company of the Swan]] found themselves on Olympus after their [[wizard]] [[Wemick|Wemick the Wise]] botched a casting of ''teleport without error''. After traveling down mountainside for {{SI|4|mile|long=yes}} they came across a cave, with an old hermit mage inside that called out to them using ''[[ventriloquism]]'' to enter. The hermit introduced himself as Jerraman, though much like what occured for the aforementioned group of adventurers, this was in actuality the Olympian god Hermes in disguise. After explaining to him how they got there,{{Cite polyhedron/72/Experience Preferred, Part One|12-13}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Realms\">Although written as a setting-neutral adventure, the [[AD&D_Trading_Cards#1993_series|1993 series of AD&D Trading Cards]] places player characters [[Matilda|Matilda the White Lady]], [[Ada the Unbending]], [[Ratha Rann|Ratha Rann the Eagle-Eyed]], [[Sagrais Bigelow]], [[Henry|Henry the Shadow Master]], and [[Wemick|Wemick the Wise]] in the Forgotten Realms. Jerraman offered the Company of the Swan a [[scroll]] of ''teleport without error'' if they could in return retrieve for him one of the arrows from the quiver of Artemis.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/73/Experience Preferred, Part Two|7}}\n\nDuring their time in Olympus, trecking through the forest of Artemis, the adventurers never encountered the goddess herself. After rescuing a [[dryad]] from six [[minotaur]]s, they were informed by her that the forest they were in was so large that she hadn't seen Artemis in those parts for decades. Desperate for the ''scroll of teleport without error'' that was offered to them, the Company of the Swan sought out a [[medusa]] mage in the woods named [[Gharleee]], who had two arrows of The Huntress in her possession.{{Cite polyhedron/72/Experience Preferred, Part One|14}} Eventually, whether by cooperating with or slaying the medusa, the Company of the Swan retrieved the arrows and earned the scroll that was promised them, allowing them to leave Olympus.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/72/Experience Preferred, Part One|15}}",
        "Realm": "Like the rest of the Olympian pantheon, Artemis lived in the [[divine realm]] of Olympus on the [[Arvandor (layer)|Arvandor]] or \"Olympus\" layer of the [[plane]] of [[Arborea]].<ref> She made her home in a small complex of caves on the side of [[Mount Olympus]], but she considered the wider realm of Olympus to be her home, only ocassionally returning to the caves between her hunts.{{Cite polyhedron/72/Experience Preferred, Part One|13-14}}",
        "Relationships": "Artemis generally preferred the company of her hunting hounds, wild animals, dryads, and [[nymph]]s over the other Olympians. She and her twin brother Apollo were was close companions, being the closest thing to a friend each other had in the pantheon. If either was ever in need of aid, most of the time the other would spring to help them.\n\nShe was typically aloof with mortals. She was less than fond of [[centaur]]s and [[satry]]s, though called upon them just as much as dryads and nymphs to protect the woodlands.\n\nOutside of the Olympians, Artemis was friends with [[Solonor Thelandira]] of the [[Seldarine]] and [[Uller]] of the [[Norse Pantheon]], both of whom she frequently went on hunts with. Of the two, she most preferred the mutual silence and few words of Uller over the more gregarious Solonor. While Uller and her sometimes hunted in the tree-strewn hillsides of Olympus, other times the two stalked the wintry plains of Uller's realm in [[Vanaheim]].",
        "Worshipers": "Artemis was honored by [[ranger]]s and hunters of either [[gender and sex|sex or gender]],<ref> druids, some elves and [[halfling]]s, and [[amazon]]s on some worlds,<ref> such those of the city of [[w:c:planescape:Arkenos|Arkenos]] on Olympus. She was often revered alongside Apollo, sharing temples in many cities. Outside of these civic temples, Artemis had shrines located in sacred groves, glens, or alongside pure streams.\n\nThe clergy of her faith were exclusively female, either [[cleric]]s or [[druid]]s, and accepted both [[human]]s and non-humans alike into their ranks. Bows were her clergy's weapons of choice, as Artemis granted them supernatural aim, and wore deerskin clothing or moss green [[tunic]]s for their priestly vestments. They had access to spells from the all, animal, divination, elemental, healing, plant, and weather spheres, as well as the [[Animal domain|animal]], [[Good domain|good]], [[Plant domain|plant]], and [[Sun domain|sun]] [[domain]]s. They were also said to have absolute control over animals within a {{SI|1000|yard|long=yes}} area.\n\nCelibacy and chastity were the highest requirements for the priestesses of Artemis. Some believed they had to go so far as to avoid men altogether. Any violation of the rules concerning chastity were grounds for Artemis revoking the priestess's standing in the church and her [[divine magic]].  They often retired from civilization to live in the forest, tending to the woodlands and their wild beasts. They spent much of their time around said animals and [[fey]].\n\nThe teachings of her faith stressed importance of nature and its value. It called upon worshipers to protect the untamed land from destruction and reckless use. To that end, her followers were encouraged to never hunt for sport, but instead only to do so when they needing of food.\n\nSacrifices to Artemis traditionally took place under a full moon and in the form of deer. Her holy days fell on  equinoxes."
