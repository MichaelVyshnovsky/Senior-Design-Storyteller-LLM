        "The Earthmother is everything, and her health is our health. She feeds us, clothes us, waters us, and shelters us. No god is greater than her, though many are noisier. No god is more forgiving, more nurturing, or more essential. Truly, Chauntea is All.\n|The creed of the [[Church of Chauntea]]\n}}": "=Description==",
        "mainbody": "auntea, when in her home realms, manifested with the appearance of a giant beautiful [[human]] woman. The Earthmother had long shiny white hair, gathered in a long braid she wrapped around her head. The length of her braid suggested the woman's great age. She had pleasant features and brown skin. Chauntea's body was lean but toned, muscled similarly to a farmer's body, shaped by hard work. She carried herself with strength and femininity. If one was to forget that they observed a deity, they could assume the beautiful woman in front of them was in her middle-age. Some described her appearance as \"a rose in full bloom.\"\n\nChauntea was dressed in an unbleached [[linen]] [[tunic]] and carried a green seed pouch, slung over one shoulder. Even though she was working her divine realm's fields barefoot, with face stained with dirt, her beauty was accentuated by wildflowers and [[ivy]] weaved into the goddess' long hair.

She also wore a [[girdle]] embroidered with images of various fruits.",
        "Personality": "Chauntea was a wise and quiet goddess given to neither pomp nor paegentry. Over the millenia she had learned the virtue of patience, being both slow to anger and not prone to hasty action, although she sometimes took this to the point of being ponderous.\n\nThis was not to be mistaken for passivity however, for the Earthmother was a vibrant and caring goddess who loved the inhabitants of [[Toril]] and enjoyed nothing more than showing them how her world might enrich their lives. The most recent centuries had seen Chauntea become completely enamored with them, especially humans, to the point she focused all her attention on helping them live off the land.\n\nThis relationship was not one-way however, for Chauntea also preached reverence towards nature. She urged the people of civilized lands to repair that which they damage, calling her followers to perform small acts of devotion. Furthermore, while she would prefer diplomacy to open conflict, to bring blight to the natural world would surely evoke the fury of the Earthmother.",
        "Divine Realm": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Chauntea maintained her [[divine realm]] named [[Great Mother's Garden]] on [[Elysium]]'s second layer of [[Eronia]]. She shared it with the otherworldly god of crops Liu from the [[Wikipedia:Chinese mythology|Chinese pantheon]]<ref><ref> and the [[Mystara]]n [[Mystara#Religion|Immortal]] of growth, [[Djaea]].<ref>\n\nChauntea's realm was a representation of her dominion over the Realms. During the annual planting season, the goddess worked her realm's sprawling fields, planting handfuls of seeds in furrows and closing them with her bare feet. The goddess took her duties with intense diligence, knowing that if she was late to plant or the fields were damaged, it caused the fertility of the Realms to suffer. A churned plot of earth in one spot of the field could cause croup failure in [[Halruaa]], in another spot - scorched earth could create famine in [[Amn]]. Her realm's fields were teeming with life: insects bussed about, [[earthworm]]s filled the soil, [[robin]]s flittered about.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Gods of Nature.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A gathering of the gods of nature: [[Mielikki]] and her unicorn, Chauntea, [[Eldath]], and [[Silvanus]].'']]\nShe had strong ties with other deities concerned with nature, such as [[Shiallia]] and [[Mielikki]], and she shared a close relationship with [[Silvanus]], but that diminished over time. She was also known to have romantic affiliations with [[Lathander]].\n\nHer most despised enemy was [[Talona]], the Lady of Pestilence, whose disposition to wreak suffering, disease and decay upon the natural world led her to oppose her with utmost vehemence. She was always in conflict with [[Talos]]. Chauntea battled deities who sought to desecrate and expunge nature; she opposed evil deities such as [[Malar]] and [[Bane]], and viewed the latter's resurgence as portentous.",
        "Worshipers": "{{Main|Church of Chauntea}}\n[[File:Chauntea symbol.jpg|thumb|right|''The holy symbol of Chauntea during the 14th century.'']]\n[[File:Chauntea symbol - Mike Schely.jpg|thumb|right|''A later holy symbol of Chauntea.'']]\nChauntea was seen by [[Faer√ªn]]ians as a critical aspect of the assumed cycle of life. Private land owners and destitute farmers (perhaps as a consequence of an unproductive harvest) visited the clerics of Chauntea for any divine suggestions for aiding the harvest. If at any time plague or drought struck the crops, farmers looked to Chauntea, since they hoped she would save the harvest, due to her love of nature.\n\nChauntea was one of the main deities worshiped in [[Rashemen]], where she was known as Bhalla. In the [[Uthgardt]] tribes, Chauntea was exclusively worshiped by women, and served by female [[shaman]]s. They believed the \"Grandmother\" gave birth to numerous daughters from [[Uthgar]] after his ascension, which became the wives of their beast gods.\n\nChauntea was also worshiped in worlds other than [[Toril]], although under a different name.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Harvest Gods:The Portal of Plenty}}",
        "Aspects": "Before her days as the Great Mother, she was known as Jannath, the Earthmother and in her early days, she frequented places of overgrown nature, wilderness, and packs of animals. In the [[Moonshae Isles]], Chauntea was still worshiped as Jannath.\n\nIn [[Rashemen]], she was worshiped as a member of the triumvirate of goddesses praised there known as [[The Three]] with [[Mielikki]] (Khelliara) and [[Mystra]] (The Hidden One). Here, she was known as \"Bhalla\".\n\nShe was worshiped as Pahluruk in and around the [[Great Glacier]].\n\nIn [[Wa]], she was worshiped as \"Chantea\" but only by an underground sect who were viewed with distrust or outright hostility. Followers of Chantea were immediately put to death upon discovery. The [[Juzimura rebellion]] was noted as the official eradication of her religion in Wa, but there were suspected cells of underground worshipers in isolated areas.",
        "History": "Chauntea was believed to be one of the eldest gods in Faer√ªn&mdash;she was born when Toril was created by the primeval battles between [[Shar]] and [[Sel√ªne]]. Sel√ªne favored her and nurtured her with her light, with the help of [[Mystryl]]."
