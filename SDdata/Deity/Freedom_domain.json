        "mainbody": "'''freedom domain''' was a deity domain associated with the right to act as one wanted and to be free from imprisonment.{{Cite dragon/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms}}",
        "Deities": "{{ListDeitiesByDomain|{{PAGENAME}}}}\n\nThe deities who held influence over the freedom domain were [[Ilmater]], [[Sehanine Moonbow]], and [[Mielikki]]. Ilmater's goal was to keep others from feeling the weight of destitution, pain and being controlled against their wishes. The freedom the Crying God granted came from his own suffering. Mielikki believed that freedom was natural, like the freedom exhibited by animals that roamed through forests. Sehanine believed that mortals should simply do what they felt was right for them.",
        "Powers": "Any divine caster that worshiped a deity who claimed the freedom domain may have chosen to channel the deity's powers. When the caster chose this domain, they came more acrobatic and gained the ability to use ''[[path of freedom]]''. When they used a power that hit an enemy, they or their ally will, for a short time, become more protected against [[magic]] and [[poison]].\n\nThe powers granted to those who chose the freedom domain included ''[[holy strike]]'', ''[[leading strike]]'', ''[[righteous brand]]'', and ''[[vanguard's lightning]]''."
