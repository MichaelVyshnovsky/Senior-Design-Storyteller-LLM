'''The Lord of the Twin Axes''', as attested by his [[holy symbol]], embodied the warrior spirit that made dwarven armies so formidable, and the '''Father of Battles''' lived, breathed, and in some ways died for warfare.\n\n{{quote|War is the finest hour of dwarvenkind.|A common saying of Clangeddin and his priests.}}",
        "Description": "Clangeddin appeared as a burly, {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} or {{SI|17|ft|long=yes}} tall dwarf in rusty [[chainmail]]. He was bald but had a titularly silver beard, constantly darting eyes and an ever-present smile.",
        "Personality": "Clangeddin was a dauntless and resolute god with a strict sense of ethics. He never backed down from a challenge, refusing to surrender even when all was lost, and was known for often clutching victory from seemingly impossible situations.\n\nDespite these severe aspects of his personality, Clangeddin was also impetuous and merry in battle, often singing both stirring ballads of battle and taunting, unnerving ditties in the middle of his fights. He shouted his appreciation of bravery and feats of skill, even when directed against himself, and most admired those who helped themselves.\n\nDespite his hatred of deceit, Clangeddin was a cunning strategist who extended his roaring approval to shrewd strategies. He was a master of turning the tables against enemy armies by anticipating their movements on the battlefield and then hiding hints, cues, and warnings in the lyrics of his songs, which dwarves had learned to listen to. Furthermore, it was possible to talk him out of pursuing a given feud and even to win him over, so long as one could speak faster than he swung his axe.",

The Temple of Clangeddin in Undermountain was briefly under the control of [[Clangeddin's Hearth]] in [[1370 DR]], until it was taken over by [[Morik Stormhand]] and his [[undead]] children."
