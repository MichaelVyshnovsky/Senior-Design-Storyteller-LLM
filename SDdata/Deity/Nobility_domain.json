        "mainbody": "The Nobility domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers themed around nobility.\nThey gained the ability to inspire their allies to greater courage and talent once a day.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the divine favor, enthrall, and magic vestment spells. Clerics of some experience could cast discern lies, greater command, and geas/quest. Those that were masters of this domain had access to repulsion, demand, and storm of vengeance."
