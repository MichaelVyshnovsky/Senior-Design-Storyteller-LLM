It was believed by the Azuposi that each of these beings was somehow the parent of the other. The pair created the land that would become the Pasocada Basin out of the primeval ocean.\nFollowing the creation of the land, Sussistinako used her song to create other spirits of creation including Iyatiku, the Corn Mother, and Alosaka, the Germinator."
