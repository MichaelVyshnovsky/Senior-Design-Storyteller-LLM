        "mainbody": "Hutijin () was an archdevil, the duke of Cania and loyal servant to the Lord of the Eighth, Mephistopheles.\nHutijin looked like a pit fiend with brown skin and longer teeth. He had more triangular wings and a longer tail. Like a pit fiend, his eyes glowed with fire.Based on artists depiction.\nHutijin was short tempered and hated mortals. When summoned by mortals, he often made the deal fast and then promptly killed the summoner for annoying him. He even went to the point of sending out devils to kill those who knew his name so he could not be summoned, though other devils have spread the means to call him around in the hopes of making Mephistopheles more vulnerable. Surprisingly, and in the most undevilish fashion, he remained loyal to Mephistopheles, despite having the military capacity to challenge him.\nHutijin had an array of spells at his disposal like most archdevils. He could also summon storms of lightning around itself. He could magically frighten those who attacked him."
