        "Description": "[[File:Sehanine Moonbow symbol.jpg|thumb|''[[Holy symbol]] of Sehanine Moonbow.'']]\nIn her [[avatar]] form, Sehanine Moonbow looked like a {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} tall youthful, ageless, female elf clad in a diaphanous [[gown]], that looked like it was made of moonbeam and dropped moonbeam drops every 10 minutes, that could be bottled as [[potion of invisibility|''potions of invisibility'']].\n\nAnother depiction of Sehanine was as a male elf. This depiction portrayed the [[Corellon|Protector]] and Sehanine as lovers. Characteristic about Sehanine's willowy male form were his eyes. They showed a sense of melancholy and tenderness when he was depicted with Corellon.",
        "Personality": "[[File:Sehanine Moonbow priestess.png|thumb|''A [[moon elf]] [[priest]] of Sehanine Moonbow.'']]\nThe Lunar Lady was a very protective deity towards elves. She sent omens to keep her people from danger, crafted illusions around elven hideouts like [[Evermeet]], [[Myth Dyraalis]], [[Rucien-Xan]], and [[Synnoria]], and organized the journeys for elves to these lands.\n\nShe hated [[undead]] and her followers made it their duty to destroy these beings.\n\nNonetheless, she was quite an aloof deity and apart from the aforementioned deeds, she kept herself apart from the happenings of [[Toril]].\n\nAs a general rule, she did not speak in a direct manner. Instead, she relied on dreams, visions, etc. to relay information.",
        "Abilities": "Sehanine Moonbow was noted as the most powerful of the female elven [[deity|deities]] but her power was not stable. To be more precise, it fluctuated with the phase of the moon. She was at her most powerful under full moon, and practically powerless during daytime.\n\nShe could cast spells from all spheres and schools but favored those of the [[all sphere|all]], [[astral sphere|astral]], [[charm sphere|charm]], [[divination sphere|divination]], [[guardian sphere|guardian]], [[healing sphere|healing]], [[necromantic sphere|necromantic]], [[protection sphere|protection]], [[summoning sphere|summoning]], [[sun sphere|sun]], and [[travel sphere|travel]].\n\n[[Illusion]] spells cast by the Lunar Lady were hard to resist against and just looking at her could cause a person to sleep for ten to forty minutes. She could cast ''[[sleep]]'' and ''[[false seeing]]'', the former three times per day, the latter once every minute against one creature within 120 ft. (36.58 m) and was particulary hard to resist. While walking, she created a trail of ''[[motes of moonlight]]'' and shot it anywhere she wanted to shoot with it. Once every minute, she could create a ''[[moonbow]]'' and ''[[Moonbridge (spell)|moonbridge]]''. When casting ''[[dream]]'', she did not need to enter a trance.\n\nThe Daughter of the Night Skies was completely immune to illusions and any effect directed at altering her mind. It was impossible to hurt her with a weapon that was less enchanted than a ''+2 weapon''.",
        "Possessions": "Sehanine Moonbow owned the ''[[Moonshaft]]'', a ''+2 quarterstaff'' with the abilities of ''[[staff of the moonglow]]'' and ''[[staff of night]]''. This weapon was her favored weapon, but was not used as often as other items and abilities such as wands, spells, and her innate abilities. Other items of hers were her gown, a ''[[cloak of displacement]]'', a ''[[wand of polymorph]]ing'', and a ''[[wand of paralyzation]]''.",
        "Divine Realm": "Sehanine Moonbow had her realm in [[Arvandor]], which was found on the [[Arvandor (layer)|layer of the same name]] within the plane of [[Arborea]].",
        "Activities": "As mentioned under [[Sehanine Moonbow#Personality|Personality]], Sehanine Moonbow protected her people’s hideouts via illusions. and seek out/excavate magical lore, especially ones concerning [[divination]] and illusion magic.\n\nElves believed in reincarnation and the Mystic Seer, alongside [[Corellon Larethian]], were believed the ones to guide the elves towards an end point of perfection.",
        "Relationships": {
            "[[Seldarine]]": "Sehanine Moonbow was a member of the Seldarine and had good relationships with the other members. She was either the daughter or wife of Corellon Larethian{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited}}\n\nHer personality trait of kindness was such, that she could bring [[Fenmarel Mestarine]], who isolated himself after an affair with Lolth, to Arvandor on occasion, as well as to calm down [[Shevarash]] during his fits of rage.\n\nShe was an aspect of [[Angharradh]] alongside [[Aerdrie Faenya]] and [[Hanali Celanil]]. However, she was the primary aspect and the others merely secondary ones.",
            "[[Dark Seldarine]]": "Sehanine Moonbow was an enemy of the Dark Seldarine. She opposed Lolth and was specifically hated by [[Vhaeraun]] for escaping his prison. The one exception to this rule was [[Eilistraee]], whom she considered an adopted daughter, but had a strained and distant relationship with.",
            "Allies": "Sehanine Moonbow was an ally of [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], [[Cyrrollalee]], [[Dumathoin]], [[Kelemvor]], [[Leira]], [[Lurue]], [[Milil]], [[Mystra]], [[Oberon]], [[Savras]], [[Segojan Earthcaller]], [[Shaundakul]], [[Selûne]], [[Titania]], and [[Urogalan]].",
            "Enemies": "Sehanine Moonbow was an enemy of [[Cyric]], [[Gruumsh]], the [[Gods of Fury]], [[Myrkul]], the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]], [[Shar]], and [[Velsharoon]]."
        },
        "History": "How Sehanine Moonbow came to be was unknown, but one theory posited, that she was Corellon’s daughter. It was believed that the elves originated from a mixture of Corellon’s blood and Sehanine’s tears. \nShe and Araushnee (later known as Lolth) were rivals over the favor of the Protector. She was one of those who participated at the creation of ''[[Sahandrian]]'', Corellon's sword.\n\nWhen Araushnee tampered with the sheath of Corellon, so it would break during Corellon's fight against Gruumsh, she did so under a full moon, not only when Sehanine was at her strongest, but also in plain sight of her. When the sword broke, Sehanine came in to help Corellon prevail against Gruumsh.\n\nSehanine confronted Araushnee during daytime, and got trapped and imprisoned by Vhaeraun. Around the time, when the [[War of the Seldarine]] ended, she came free under heavy but undefined sacrifices and kept Araushnee from poisoning Corellon. She then created Angharradh with Hanali and Aerdrie."
