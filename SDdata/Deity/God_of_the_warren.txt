The god of the warren was a title given to a deity associated with rabbits and hares, known in Kara-Tur.
This god was followed by hare hengeyokai. One was the hero Xax Chung of Koryo in the midâ€“14 century DR, who wore around his neck a brass chain bearing the symbol of the god of the warren, but its meaning was unknown or obscure to those who saw it.
