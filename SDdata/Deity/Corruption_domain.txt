The Corruption domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and other powers related to corruption, attacking the body and mind and polluting the environment.
Once a day, a priest with this domain could strike an object and it would have no resistance to damage.
As they advanced, a priest could strike a victim with blindness or deafness, infect them with a contagion of their choice, and even infect a number of people with a debilitating pox. Or they could fill a foes mind with a sense of doom, turn them to evil via morality undone, deteriorate their intellect with feeblemind, or make them suffer insanity. Finally, the mightiest Corruption priest could befoul a body of water or despoil a wide area, killing vegetation and damaging things.
