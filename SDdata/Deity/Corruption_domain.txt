==Powers==
Once a day, a priest with this domain could strike an object and it would have no resistance to damage.

==Spells==
As they advanced, a priest could strike a victim with ''[[blindness or deafness]]'', infect them with a ''[[contagion]]'' of their choice, and even infect a number of people with a debilitating ''[[pox]]''. Or they could fill a foe's mind with a sense of ''[[doom]]'', turn them to evil via ''[[morality undone]]'', deteriorate their intellect with ''[[feeblemind]]'', or make them suffer ''[[insanity]]''. Finally, the mightiest Corruption priest could ''[[befoul]]'' a body of water or ''[[despoil]]'' a wide area, killing vegetation and damaging things.
