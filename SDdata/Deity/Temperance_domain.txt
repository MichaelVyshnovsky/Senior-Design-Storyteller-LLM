When preparing spells for the day, any domain spell that was unused on the previous day granted the priest healing in proportion to the level of the spell (the more difficult the spell, the more health was restored).

==Spells==
Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[remove fear]]'', ''[[calm emotions]]'', and ''[[dispel magic]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[atonement]]'', and ''[[greater dispel magic]]''. Those that were masters in this domain had access to ''[[symbol of stunning]]'', ''[[shield of law]]'', and ''[[iron body]]''.
