        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a beast cult existed in the [[sewers of Waterdeep]]{{Cite dungeon/30/And a Dozen Eggs|12-13}} that venerated Sneel and whose members deliberately allowed themselves to be afflicted with the [[wererat]] form of [[lycanthropy]]. Sometime in the late 1350's DR, after the [[Mirtul 15|15{{th}} of Mirtul]], a [[cleric]] of the cult by the name of [[Pravus Muridae]] used a [[tanystropheus]] that had escaped into the sewers to lure out those seeking to claim the bounties placed on the [[dinosaur]]. He would rob the [[adventurer]]s and bounty hunters lured out, then use their bodies as either food for his fellow wererats or sacrifices to Sneel.\n\nBy the 15{{th}} century DR, this cult still remained and was secretly popular in the city's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-20 - Sneel the God of Rats}}",
        "Worshipers": "Sneel was primarily worshiped by intelligent rats, though some [[humanoid]]s also showed it reverence, including wererats."
