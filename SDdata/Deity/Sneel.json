        "mainbody": "Sneel was a lesser deity of rats that was worshiped on Toril by beast cults.\nIn the 14 century DR, a beast cult existed in the sewers of Waterdeep that venerated Sneel and whose members deliberately allowed themselves to be afflicted with the wererat form of lycanthropy. Sometime in the late 1350s DR, after the 15 of Mirtul, a cleric of the cult by the name of Pravus Muridae used a tanystropheus that had escaped into the sewers to lure out those seeking to claim the bounties placed on the dinosaur. He would rob the adventurers and bounty hunters lured out, then use their bodies as either food for his fellow wererats or sacrifices to Sneel.\nBy the 15 century DR, this cult still remained and was secretly popular in the citys Dock Ward.\nSneel was primarily worshiped by intelligent rats, though some humanoids also showed it reverence, including wererats."
