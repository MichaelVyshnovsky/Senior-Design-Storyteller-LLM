Velsharoon took his name as an alias, but their relationship is unclear, as they shared some similarities but also differed in many details. was the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerunian]] [[demigod]] of [[necromancy]], the patron of [[lich]]es and those that explored [[undeath]]. Arrogant and obsessed, the '''Archmage of Necromancy''' continued his experiments on the living and the dead as a god, paying no heed to the lesser lives lost in the name of his research and encouraging his disciples to do the same.{{cite book/Magic of Faerûn|7-8}}",

            "Manifestations": "Velsharoon's favored manifestation was a burning skull, wreathed in red, pale blue or blue-green flames. He was fond of using various gemstones to denote his favor or presence of hues including black, purple, maroon, rust-red, gray, and a bright and unnatural green reminiscent of [[green slime]]s. The sudden appearance of a [[bloodrose]] was said to herald him."

        "Personality": "As a god, Velsharoon was canny, yet extremely vain and selfish, concerned overmuch with revenge and experimenting on both living and dead. This was not a great change from the mortal he was.",
        "Possessions": "In his humanoid form, Velsharoon wielded the ''[[Skull Staff of the Necromancer]]''.",
        "Divine Realm": "Velsharoon had his [[divine realm]] called [[Death's Embrace]] on [[Mungoth]], the third mount of [[Gehenna]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]]. In the [[World Tree cosmology]] it lay on the magical plane of [[Dweomerheart]], far underground beneath [[Azuth (realm)|Azuth]] and [[The Eye]].

It is possible the Red Wizards were founded earlier, this is actually a precursor organization, or that Velsharoon became a Red Wizard later and this is a retrospective application of the term.\n\nOnce, Velsharoon had sought the position of [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]], but he feuded with several other Red Wizards, including his chief rival, [[Szass Tam]], who saw him driven out of Thay.{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}} and [[Mempter]].{{Cite polyhedron/93/A Fool's Errand: The Viper Comes To Ravens Bluff|19}} The former four had challenged Velsharoon in his wicked plots. In turn, the arch-necromancer worked to acquire enough power to destroy those who'd opposed him.\n\nIn the [[Plains of Purple Dust]], he had discovered a process to achieve demigodhood through a potion which called for  the blood of adventurers.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|149}} As a god, he was granted [[Cyric]]'s portfolio over necromancy;{{cite web/The Churches and Thieves of Selgaunt}} sages speculated this was to counterbalance [[Kelemvor]]'s dislike for the undead.{{cite book/Magic of Faerûn|2}}\n\nHowever, his service to Talos required him to expend his divine energy far too quickly, and he soon turned his allegiance to [[Azuth]].{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|151}} He later made a secret alliance of convenience with Talos, using his servants' undead servants to spread chaos and destruction; he was not liked by either of his masters, because of this.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|159}}\n\nHe was destroyed by the Simbul in {{yearlink|1425}}, leaving behind his charred body, which was watched in [[Aglarond]] since.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|88}} However, his cult was still alive and had access to divine spells within [[Mulmaster]] after the [[Second Sundering]], indicating he may have been restored by [[Ao]] during the event.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|4}}",
        "Rumors": "His influence was felt in the {{yearlink|1090}}, in the place that would later become the [[Battle of Bones]], where a floating, flame-wreathed skull was seen during the last skirmish in the war, though he wouldn't become a divinity until later. Whether the symbol foretold his ascension or was adopted upon his embrace was not known.{{cite book/Elminster's Ecologies Appendix I/The Battle of Bones|14}}\n\nThe Simbul was said to have sacrificed herself to destroy the god's corpse in the [[Astral Plane]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Player's Guide|77}}",
        "Trivia": "There was a ring belonging to Empress [[Shoon V]] of the late 3{{rd}} century [[DR]] known as the ''[[Dual Ring of Velsharoon's Bindings]]''.{{cite book/Calimport|91}} His relationship to the ring is unknown.<ref group=\"note\">Apart from the name, it is unknown how Velsharoon is linked to the ring and who or what is under bindings. It is possible the ring was associated with Velsharoon after Shoon V's ownership of it."
