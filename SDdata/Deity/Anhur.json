        "mainbody": "Anhur (), also known as Ramathant in Thay and Ramman, Rumathep or Ramatep in Unther, was a wise and peace-loving deity. His role was protecting Mulhorand from evil, a task for which he remained ever-vigilant while still finding the time to appreciate those he defended.\nAnhur typically appeared as a Mulan human with four arms, red skin, and dark eyes. His hair appeared dark, and he usually had a short beard that was often braided.\nAnhurs will was often made known through the actions of animals, such as lions, falcons, and trained war beasts or guard animals, as well as the uncontrolled actions of war chariots.\n Lion Individuals hostile to Mulhorand might witness a large lion watching them on the horizon. No matter the distance traveled toward it, this manifestation always remained unmoving and out of reach.\n Weather A Mulhorandi army on the march may hear a steady rumbling of thunder that serves to restore their endurance while traveling. Anhur might manifest as rolling thunder if one of his followers encounters resistance while attempting to carry out his will. If this warning proves insufficient, the follower may be struck by a bolt of lightning that inflicts no damage but marks the ground. Particularly dangerous enemies of Mulhorand could find themselves accompanied by a dark storm cloud overhead. This manifestation would strike out at the interlopers and continue to follow them until they left the region.\n Ghostly Lance Armies composed of Anhurs followers might encounter a ghostly lance standing upright on a battlefield. This manifestation would boost the morale of his followers, and acted as a rallying point during conflict.\nAnhur had the ability to transform his lance into a falchion, and would sometimes capture an opponents weapon to use against them in his left hands. He was also able to command normal animals, though magical and enchanted creatures might resist his will.\nAnhur carried a powerful lance in his right arms and wore scale or lamellar mail and a headdress sporting three plumes.\nAnhurs views often came into conflict with those of Horus-Re, both of whom sought to guide Mulhorand and its people. His enemies included Set, Sekolah, Hoar, and could come to include Tempus if Mulhorand continued to expand. Anhur and Isis considered each other to be allies despite increased conflicts due to similarities in their portfolios after Anhur absorbed that of Rammans upon his death. He and Nephthys often worked together to thwart threats from nearby Thay, and from time to time he was romantically involved with Sharess.\nright|250px|thumb|The holy symbol of Anhur.\nMartial skills were an important factor in the lives of the clergy and followers of the Church of Anhur. Clerics spent much of their time preparing for battle, as well as training the soldiers of Mulhorand. They focused on executing daring maneuvers and plans in the hopes of increasing the glory of their nation. Divine spell casters devoted to Anhur prayed for their spells at dawn.\nTypical garb for Anhurs clergy includes a breastplate and collar shaped in the figure of a lion for high-ranking priests, as well as a white linen skirt known as a kalasiris and sandals laced to knee height. A headdress and collar were also common. These priests often dyed their skin red to emulate their deity and typically shaved their heads. A set of three blue circles painted on their forehead served as a symbol of their calling. They often tattooed themselves to commemorate personal achievements and victories. The quality of a priests clothing reflected that individuals power and standing. When preparing for combat, followers of Anhur favored scale or  lamellar mail, but would also readily select the best equipment for the situation.\nright|150px|thumb|A priest of Anhur.\nThe position of priest in the church of Anhur was hereditary members belonging to the House of Ramathant who could claim at least one divine incarnation of Anhur among their ancestors were viable. Anhurs clergy was composed entirely of humans native to Mulhorand.\nTemples to Anhur were solidly built structures design to repel invaders. They were continuously stocked with equipment and provisions in the event that they were besieged.\nThe center of power of the church of Anhur was located in Sultim, the location of the Blood Fortress. Worship of the Falcon of War was strongest in Mulhorand, but temples dedicated to Anhur could also be found in Unther and Chessenta.\nInformal organizations were common among the followers of Anhur, especially with those that served in the nations military.\n Guardians of Skuld Formed since the Time of Troubles and led by the church of Anhur, this organization counted followers of Anhur, Isis, and Osiris among its members.\n Order of the Watchful Lion This organization served as Mulhorands first line of defense. Its members often scouted neighboring regions and reported important events, areas, and people to their superiors.\nThe clergy of Anhur often celebrated the anniversaries of the important battles and victories of Mulhorand. These were times of great revelry within the citadels of the Falcon of War, and competitive events testing the participants physical prowess were often held at these times.\n Time of Storms The month of Tarsakh, known as the Time of Storms in Mulhorand, was a month of celebration for the followers of Anhur. The deity was said to patrol the nations border regions at this time, and in celebration of this, Anhurs clergy participated in a nonlethal combat tournament that continued until the month ended. The tournament concluded on Greengrass, and the victor would be awarded the title of Champion of Anhur for the next year.\n Remembrance Ritual A time to remember and reflect upon those warriors that had fallen in service to Mulhorand over the past year, the Remembrance Ritual was celebrated on Highharvestide. The celebration concluded with participants praising Anhur for the recent victories Mulhorand has achieved.\nAnhur and his church were highly esteemed in Mulhorand prior to the Orcgate Wars, but fell out of favor after the death of Re. He had been blamed for most of Mulhorands military failures by the followers of Horus-Re, and the two churches remained rivals far into the future.\nAs the orc hordes surged forward, emboldened by the victory of Gruumsh over Re, Anhur devised a counter assault that eventually led to the end of the Orcgate Wars.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Anhur secured the portfolio of the recently slain Untheric deity Ramman. He forced Hoar, who had slain Ramman, to leave Unther once again, an act that Hoar actively sought revenge for. Anhur also distinguished himself by confronting the sahuagin deity Sekolah during this period of history.\nThe church of Anhur suffered numerous political attacks originating from the clergy of Horus-Re during the Time of Troubles. Anhur regained much of the status he lost during this period through aggressive actions against his foes.\nDuring the Second Sundering, Anhur and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of demigods and led the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari in a manner similar to how the Chosen manifested in other regions. As of 1489 DR, Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people."
