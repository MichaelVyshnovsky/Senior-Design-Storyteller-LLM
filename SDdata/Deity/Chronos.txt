'''Chronos''' was an ancient [[deity]], the god of time, ironically lost to the ages. Religious texts and ancient histories spoke of him in passing. He was known to have been worshiped by the nation of [[Orva]] but it was unknown how he died. Shrines of Chronos still held power millennia later. Offerings would crumble to dust in mere seconds and in return, the offeror received a vision of the past or the future.

Statues of Chronos depicted him as a tall man in a hooded [[robe]] with feathered wings, holding a [[scythe]] and an [[hourglass]].

==History==
Some time after Orva sunk below the [[Vast Swamp]], Chronos became an aspect of [[Labelas Enoreth]].
