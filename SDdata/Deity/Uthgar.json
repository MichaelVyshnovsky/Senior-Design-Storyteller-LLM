        "Description": "Uthgar appeared as a burly {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} tall warrior with piercing blue eyes, a booming voice, and blond hair. He had his long hair in a single braid going down his back and sported a thick, drooping mustache. All he wore was a [[leather]] [[breechcloth]], a battle harness, and furred [[boots]].",
        "Personality": "As a god, Uthgar was known for his competitive nature in combat and tireless ethic for training and tactics. He truly enjoyed everyday pleasures such as coupling, eating, drinking, hunting, or the camaraderie of another warrior.",
        "Divine Realm": "The [[divine realm]] of the Battle Father was called [[Uthgardtheim]]. It was located on the plane of [[Ysgard]], on the [[Ysgard (layer)|first layer, sharing that name]], in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], and on the plane of [[Warrior's Rest]], overseen by Tempus, in the [[World Tree cosmology]]. It generally was a battlefield on a winter-cold wasteland with some table mounts and rocky outcroppings.",
        "Relationships": "Uthgar served as exarch to Tempus, and considered his patron to be his one true ally.\n\nHe disliked several powers for stealing away the faithful from a number of his tribes. [[Helm]] and the members of [[the Triad]] stole away the worship of nearly all of the [[Black Lion tribe]], [[Malar]] all but ruined the [[Blue Bear tribe]], and [[Auril]] corrupted tribesmen of the [[Elk tribe]].",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "The dogma of the Uthgardt religion varied from tribe to tribe, as each beast cult emphasized different barbaric virtues. The clerics of these tribes, along with those who took Uthgar as a [[patron deity]], had to abide by the somewhat broader guidelines of morality and order as those of the beast totems who mediated between Uthgar and his people.\n\nCommon among all the tribes beliefs was strength above all else. Warfare and hunting demonstrated strength, whereas [[arcane magic]] exemplified weakness. The family of the tribe, along with their ancestors were to be held sacred. The Uthgardt totem beasts brought wisdom to all through the fear and respect commanded by the tribesmen."

            "Mortal Life": "'''Uthgar Gardolfsson''' was born to [[Gardolf Beorunna]], famed warrior and Thane of [[Ruathym]]. He took on many of his father's better qualities but also grew to be quite cruel and malicious. When he came of age, Uthgar yearned for true battle and glory. He rallied a great number of followers, amassed a fleet of ships and gained the title of Thane. In the {{YearlinkName|95}}, after a recent victory at [[Bjorn's Hold]], Uthgar's forces assaulted the \"Great Island\" and slew the leaders of the [[magocracy]] of [[Illusk]].\n\nRather than being exalted as a hero and liberator, Uthgar's ships were burned and his \"barbarian\" horde was driven further inland. He continued his conquest throughout the North and offered protection to the villages and citizens who swore fealty to him. When a horde of [[orc]]s swept down from the [[Spine of the World]], in the {{YearlinkName|100}},\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|123}}, Uthgar finally engaged in battle with [[Gurt]], the Lord of the [[Pale Giant]]s. While Uthgar slew the giant leader, he sustained mortal wounds and succumbed to death on the site that would be known as [[Morgur's Mound]]. His followers declared themselves the Uthgardt in his honor, descendants of Uthgar. After his body was interred within the burial mound,",
            "As a God": "After the events of the [[Spellplague]], in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Uthgar became an [[exarch]] of his patron Tempus.\n{{Sectstub}}"
