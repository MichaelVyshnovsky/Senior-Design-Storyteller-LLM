She would later claim the cold vast plains with her son [[Lanaxis]].",

Her sons were [[Lanaxis]], [[Arno and Julian]], [[Masud]], [[Nicias]], [[Obadai]], [[Ottar]], [[Ruk]], [[Vilmos|Vilmos,]] and [[Dunmore]]; the last, while initially believed Annam's son, was later thought to be the product of Othea's affair with the sea god [[Ulutiu]].  She also gave birth to at least five unnamed sons from affairs outside her marriage to Annam that resulted in the ogre races and the four giant-kin races. <ref>[[Ray Winninger]] (September 1995). ''[[Giantcraft]]''. Edited by [[Karen S. Boomgarden]]. ([[TSR, Inc.]]), p. 9. ISBN [[Special:BookSources/0-7869-0163-2|0-7869-0163-2]].",

Before she died, she cursed him, causing him to flee to [[Arborea]]. Her unborn son [[Hartkiller]] managed to survive."
