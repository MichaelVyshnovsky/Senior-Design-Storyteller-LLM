        "Description": "Utu manifested as a [[human]] male bathed in dazzling golden light that destroyed [[undead]]. Any non-indestructible object that touched his body would melt. Contact with any heat above 100 degrees Fahrenheit would instantly heal all of his wounds. He had the power to transform living matter into soil. In battle, he flung bits of the sun at his opponents, up to two miles away.",
        "History": "Utu presumably came to [[Toril]] with the other Untheric deities aboard the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]''. He was killed by one of the [[orc pantheon|orcish gods]] in {{Yearlink|-1071}}, and his body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in [[Unther]]."
