        "mainbody": "Demigod\nKiputytto was a demigoddess of disease and sister to Loviatar. She was slain by Talona.\nKiputytto was described as a black skinned, twisted old crone with a scarred face.\nFor a time, Kiputytto was the lover of the god Bane. Their romance ended however when she realized he attempted to steal her divine power during their daliances.\nIn  Kiputytto attacked Talona, a deity who shared a portfolio with hers. Their chosen battleground was city of Asram, one of the four remaining cities of Netheril. Talona gained the upper hand by plaguing the city, forcing the inhabitants to pray to her. Kiputytto struck back with similar method, however her plagues overcame the curative resources of the city and left the population dead in less than a month. In the aftermath, Talona slew Kiputytto.\nIn the wake of the Second Sundering, dead gods and forgotten pantheons sparked into the existence once again. Kiputytto was among those deities returned to life with the return of Mystra, the Mother of All Magic. However, Kiputyttos new life was cut short as Moander, the ancient deity of rot and corruption, devoured the goddess along with several other resurrected deities."
