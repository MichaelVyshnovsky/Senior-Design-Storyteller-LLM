        "History": "Botu'Astok was believed to be the progenitor of their people by the Astok tribe. His worship spread to many of the citizens of nearby [[Umara]] following the [[Umara Rebellion|rebellion]] that saw the Khan of the Astok tribe assume the position of Caliph in Umara. It was decreed by the new Caliph that Botu'Astok could be worshiped within Umara's mosques just as all of the other Zakharan gods. Many native Umarans viewed Botu'Astok as a god of rebirth and renewal, and worshiped him with the hopes that Umara would be led into an era of new prosperity."
