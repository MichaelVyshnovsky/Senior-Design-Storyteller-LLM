        "Description": "During his numerous visits to the [[Great Mother's Garden]], Lathander appeared as a giant of a man, to match the size of his lover, [[Chauntea]]. His visage radiated bright shine of the morning sun and his hair burned with flaming orange-red fire. Lathander appeared as a handsome young slender muscled [[human]] man. His preferred clothes were a set of colorful [[robe]]s of reds, pinks, and yellows. A red and [[gold]]en [[sash]] embraced the god's waist. He wore golden [[sandal]]s and left scorch marks everywhere his feet touched the ground. Lathander often floated and liked to materialize in a glorious spectacle of dawn sun beams. His radiant face darkened akin to solar eclipse when the god was angered or upset.",
        "Personality": "Despite being among the oldest of [[Faerun]]'s gods, Lathander nonetheless retained the cheery hopefulness of youth. His was an eternal optimist, with a constant willingness to focus on hopes for the future rather than wallow in the failures of the present. He was a doggedly determined god who encouraged proactive altruism and constant reevaluation of the old ways. Exuberant and friendly, his interests laid in vibrant life (regarding both birth and nature), and conversely urged the destruction of the corrupted mockeries of life that he saw the [[undead]] as.\n\nThough liked for his many positive qualities, Lathander also had a reputation for displaying the flaws common to the young, such as zealotry, vanity, and excess. Though enthusiastically altruistic and only slightly vain, it was said by his critics that his aggressive do-gooder mentality often prevented him from taking more sensible courses of action. His headstrong conceit could blind him to the consequences of his actions as in his idealistic crusades he simply attacked directly and hoped for the best, ignoring the ramifications.",
        "Relationships": "Lathander and Chauntea had been romantically connected for centuries and saw each other as kindred spirits. His allies included [[Gond]], [[Tymora]], [[Tyr]], [[Torm]], [[Ilmater]], [[Sune]], [[Selûne]], [[Oghma]], [[Kelemvor]], and [[Mielikki]]. His foes were [[Cyric]], [[Talos]], and [[Shar]]. [[Helm]] held a great deal of resentment for Lathander, as the latter indirectly caused the death of Helm's lover, [[Murdane]].\n\nPrior to Chauntea, Lathander's paramour was [[Tyche]], an ancient goddess of fortune who later split into Tymora and [[Beshaba]]. Tyche and Lathander once observed the birth of a new universe for an entire year while lounging on a [[space whale]]'s back. The couple watched as a [[crystal sphere]] engorged and then split apart, new stars lit inside them. The Morninglord held that memory dear.",

        "History": "Lathander was the central figure in the [[Dawn Cataclysm]], an ill-fated attempt by the Morninglord to reshape the Faerûnian pantheon in his own image. Several deities were killed in the events that followed, including the goddess [[Murdane]], a death for which [[Helm]] never forgave Lathander. The Morninglord believed that his efforts went so wrong because of the interference of agents of [[Shar]], and secretly began working on a second attempt at reforming the pantheon.\n\nThe biggest loss for Lathander, however was [[Tyche]], his lover at the time. She refused to partake in Lathander's grab for power and left him to wander the Realms, leaving him a kiss of misfortune as a parting gift. It was during that time she came across a beautiful [[rose]] high in the mountains of Toril. The flower was so perfect, the goddess thought it to be an apology from her misguided consort. In reality, the flower was a ''[[seed of Moander]]''. Tyche tucked the rose in her hair, from whence the flower corrupted and rotted her from the inside. To save her, [[Selûne]] was forced to split the goddess of luck, birthing [[Tymora]] and [[Beshaba]]. Neither of two women were to Lathander's liking and he missed his lost lover for centuries to come.\n\nIn [[916 DR]], Lathander, enraged with the unchanging, tyrannical, undead-centric philosophy of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], sent an avatar to Cormanthyr to personally do battle with [[Sammaster]] during a [[Harper]] raid. He destroyed Sammaster but was wounded in the battle.\n\nIn [[1345 DR]], Lathander's worshipers, along with those of [[Selûne]], [[Shar]], and [[Tempus]] were involved in religious unrest, culminating in the [[Night of Temple Fires]].\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], Lathander met the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] after they restored one of his sacred statues in [[Myth Drannor]]. He requested that they rid his [[Temple of Lathander (Myth Drannor)|temple]] there of the [[Dark God]] and offered them help in their quest. During the event in which the adventurers recovered the [[Morning Light]], Lathander bestowed to them the magic sword ''[[Dhauzimmer]]''.\n\nLathander, however, returned during the events of [[Second Sundering]] in [[1486 DR]], thanks to the effort of his [[Chosen]] and prophet [[Stedd Whitehorn]]. However, by the year [[1491 DR]], Amaunator and Lathander were once again worshiped as separate beings.<ref> It is unknown if they were actually separate beings by this time or if Lathander was simply granting spells to the followers of Amaunator.{{Speculation}}"
