Clerics who chose this domain were granted free access to these spellsâ€”they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance.\nNovice clerics of this domain could cast animal friendship, speak with animals, barkskin, and spike growth. Those of some experience were able to use the plant growth, wind wall, dominate beast, and grasping vine spells. Master clerics of the Nature domain were skilled enough to cast insect plague and tree stride. In addition, they were able to charm animals and plants."
