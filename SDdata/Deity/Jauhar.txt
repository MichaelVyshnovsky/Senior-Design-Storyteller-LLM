__NOTOC__
Jauhar was the goddess of wealth of Zakhara. She was technically only a local goddess, but probably the most influential of those, as she was worshiped in a number of cities. In the Cities of the Pantheon, she was seen as a Great Goddess and took the place of Jisan there. 
She preached the importance of hard work to acquire riches. As such Jauhar was above such concerns as alignment, as wealth could be acquired to feed the hungry or to oppress the poor. Jauhars symbol was a gold dinar.
Old images showed the goddess as a beautiful dancer adorned with coins, but efforts had been made by her pantheist worshipers to destroy all such pictures as blasphemous. They instead describe her garbed in a chador, a garment covering a woman from head to foot, but with a gold dinar on her forehead.
Jauhar had many worshipers among merchants and craftsmen and filled a similar role in the Land of Fate as Waukeen did in Faer√ªn.
