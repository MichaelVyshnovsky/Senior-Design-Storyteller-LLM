'''Haask, Voice of Hargut''' was said to be one of the [[Seven Lost Gods]] who bowed before [[Bane]] long ago.

==Description==
Hargut was a worm-like abomination with a gargantuan mouth filled with countless rows of teeth. Its skin was a poisonous green covered in red sores, with veins and organs somewhat visible beneath. Haask survived as a [[symbiont]] attached to the outside of Hargut's body.

==History==
Haask, a monstrous greathorn [[minotaur]], conquered [[Ironfang Keep]] in {{Yearlink|-981}}, declaring himself priest-king of the land of [[Grong-Haap]]. He ruled Grong-Haap for six hundred years, expanding it to include the modern lands of [[Thar]], the eastern [[Moonsea]], and northern highlands of [[the Vast]].{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: Ironfang Keep|50-51}}

In the {{YearlinkName|-350}}, Haask summoned an [[elder evil]] to combat a [[goblinoid]] horde: '''Hargut of the Gray Pestilence'''. Hargut slew tens of thousands, consigning their souls to the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]], but three humans, the mortals who would become known as [[Bane]], [[Myrkul]], and [[Bhaal]], took advantage of the distraction to attack and nearly slay Haask, revealing his true form as a [[doppelganger]] of the elder [[batrachi]] race.

As Haask lay dying, the [[Dead Three]] persuaded him to agree to a ritual that would bind him and Hargut together as one entity under the command of the three adventurers. Hargut agreed, and together they became Haask, Voice of Hargut, a fell entity bound to Ironfang Keep and responsible for the creation of numerous abominations and chimerical monstrosities during the centuries that followed.

If freed, Haask, Voice of Hargut, would ally itself with [[Malar]] and [[Ghaunadaur]], and work to exact vengeance on [[Bane]] and his church.
