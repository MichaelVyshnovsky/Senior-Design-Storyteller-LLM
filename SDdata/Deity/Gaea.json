        "mainbody": "Gaea was a greater power of earth, a progenitor of the greater titans, and grandmother of the first Olympians. though the latter was more likely just Olympian boasting.There were no known worshipers of Gaea in the Realms. However, Gaea is mentioned in the opening pages of the Living City module No Time to Lose. For this reason, Gaea is documented in this article.\nIn her true form, Gaea is the earth itself. Her avatar took the form of a beautiful, mature and buxom woman.\nOver time some mischaracterized Gaea as some sort of schemer that jealously craved retaining her deific position and strength in light of the Olympian pantheons rise to power. In actuality she was a very concerned and loving motherly figure. She was also rather aloof, rarely ever meddling in the affairs of mortals, and had a liking for hideous monsters.\nAvatars of Gaea could call upon the spheres of all, animal, charm, elemental, healing, plant, and weather for her spells. In addition, any being that looked uninvited upon her avatar could be petrified or blinded for one to ten days.\nOverall, the power that Gaea had at her disposal far outweighed that possessed by the Olympian deity Zeus.\nThe avatars of Gaea wielded a black sickle that had the power to instantly slay those struck by it.\nGaea sometimes provided aid to mortals in dire need, in return for sacrifices of fruits and animals being made to her. However, she never provided aid in fighting against hideous monsters. She potentially would even provide aid to such monsters brought to her attention.\nAccording to the Olympians understanding of how the multiverse came to be, as documented in their the tome the Great Theogony, before everything began there was nothing but an indescribable roiling mass of chaos. From this chaos arose various aspects of nature, While the Olympians story of creation was steeped in their own egocentric biases, it was true that Gaea was an incredibly old deity.\nGaea would then create and marry the primeval god Uranus. who by some accounts numbered eleven or twelve in total. Gaea then went on to birth more creations. Some were fair in appearance like the Titans, whilst others were far more monstrous, such as the cyclopses and the hecatoncheires. Uranus, proving to be a cruel and jealous man, would keep all of her more monstrous children locked up as he hated to look upon them. Some accounts told of them being locked up inside her earthen depths, causing Gaea pain, while others told of them being locked up in Tarterus. Either way, with time Gaea grew sickened over the imprisoned state of her children.\nGaea convinced one of her children, the greater titan Cronus, to overthrow his father and thus avenge her mistreatment. Cronus did so, severely wounding Uranus. The blood from his wounds fell upon Gaea, fertilizing her once more, causing the creation of the Furies and the gigantes.  The wounded Uranus then fled from the battle to the farthest reaches of the multiverse, leaving his final fate unclear.\nCronus then married the Titan Rhea and assumed command of the Greater Titans, going back on his word to Gaea that he would free her monstrous brood. Furious, Gaea laid a curse upon Cronus, proclaiming that one day his own children would usurp him in turn. Eventually Gaeas curse came to pass and Cronus was usurped by his own son Zeus, who alongside his siblings led the way for the creation of the Olympian pantheon.\nThe newly formed Olympian pantheons first act following this was the casting away of the majority of the Greater Titans into Tarterus. Not wishing for any of her children to be imprisoned, Gaea tried to send the gigantes and a hundred-headed dragon against the Olympians to liberate and avenge the Titans. Her creations brought the Olympians to their knees, but the new generation of gods ultimately held up against them. Despite this and some other early attempts to avenge or liberate her children, Gaea remained an ally of the Olympian pantheon.\nIn the month of Hammer, in the , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff found themselves transported to the plane of Tarterus after defending the githzerai fortress of TahDarr from a tanarri incursion. At the urgings of the fallen paladin Elendil, the adventurers sought out Gaeas child Cronus for a way back to Toril.\nUnlike other deities, Gaea did not need proper direct worshipers, which led some to claim that she wasnt a proper deity. Instead, it was believed that the constant life and movement on the Prime Material worlds was equivalent. Nor did she need require temples or sacrifices, only desiring that those on the Prime treated their worlds with love and respect.\nWhenever Gaea had proper priests, they were always druids. Weapons commonly wielded by them included clubs, quarterstaves, sickles, and various agricultural implements. They had access to spells from the spheres of all, animal, divination, elemental, healing, plant, and weather. Among the spells they always had access to were cure disease and divination. They also were liable to know the spells control weather and control winds.\nThe druids of Gaea oversaw tasks appropriate to her portfolio, such as animal husbandry, planting, and ministering aid to the sick. They also often served as oracles for their communities.\nIn terms of the philosophical planar factions of the multiverse, Gaea was worshiped by some members of the Sign of One."
