        "Description": "Malar had two favored forms when he was prowling the Realms: the Beast and the Master of the Hunt. As the Beast, he was a {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} long, man-high feline creature, sleek and supple in his movements. His ebony fur was matted with blood, which dripped endlessly from his talons and fangs, and he could not speak in this form. The Master of the Hunt meanwhile was humanoid and as tall as the Beast was long, though it too had black fur. Above his red eyes was a large rack of antlers able to melt away and reappear at his will, while below them was a whuffling, flesh-draped hole rather than a nose and mouth. Though able to speak in this form, he only did so in a low, growling undertone or vicious snarl.",
        "Relationships": "Malar was one of the [[Deities of Fury]], led by [[Talos]]. He held a long-standing alliance with [[Lolth]] against the [[Seldarine]], and other dark deities like [[Bane]] and [[Loviatar]]. He fought against deities of peace, civilization, and nature, but held particular hate for [[Nobanion]] for defeating him in a battle during the [[Time of Troubles]].\n{{Fq\n| width  = 250px\n| source = Malar refusing to back down.\n| text   = I hunt wherever I want and ''whomever'' I want.\n}}\n\nAfter the events of the Spellplague, Malar became subject to Silvanus' rule as a resident of the [[Deep Wilds]].

        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Malarites believed that it was an honor to Malar to make one's killing bloody and long. His followers sometimes formed in bands, called \"Hunts\". While forbidden to slay the young or the pregnant, Hunts typically followed his dogma and evoked wanton slaughter in Malar's name.",
            "Holy Days": "[[File:Malar Symbol-5e.png|thumb|right|''Another holy symbol of Malar.'']]\nThe [[High Hunt]] ritual was a vicious hunt in which a captured humanoid was released, and for the next day and night attempted to escape the prowling worshipers of the Beastlord. If they managed to survive, they won their freedom as well as, perhaps, other things.\n\nThe [[Feast of the Stags]] day made Malar's worship more tolerable in certain areas. For this event, all people were invited to partake of the bounty of the hunt, regardless of faith. At this time, priests of Malar chose some widows, orphans, elderly, or infirm citizens and promised to provide meat for their tables for the winter.",
