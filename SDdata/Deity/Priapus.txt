Priapus was a god of fertility worshiped by primitive human tribes on the Isle of Firando in the Outer Isles southwest of Wa in Kara-Tur. He was believed to grant fertility to infertile women. He was one of the Eight Million Gods.
A big temple was erected to Priapus on the island before Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR).
