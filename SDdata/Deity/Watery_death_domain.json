        "mainbody": "atery Death was a prestige domain granted to certain very experienced divine spellcasters, such as kuo-toan sea mother whips of Blibdoolpoolp. It bestowed the power to smite any non-aquatic creature once per day, and a range of killing water-themed spells.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the entangle, mark of the outcast, and control water spells. Clerics of some experience could cast rushing waters, dehydrate, and drown. Those that were masters in this domain had access to contagious fog, horrid wilting, and mass drown."
