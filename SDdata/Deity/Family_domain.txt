The Family domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers inspired by family.
Once a day for a brief period, priests with this domain could protect a limited number of allies who stayed within 10 feet (3 meters), making them more able to avoid attacks.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the bless, shield other, and helping hand spells. Clerics of some experience could cast imbue with spell ability, Rarys telepathic bond, and heroes feast. Those that were masters of this domain had access to refuge, protection from spells, and prismatic sphere.
