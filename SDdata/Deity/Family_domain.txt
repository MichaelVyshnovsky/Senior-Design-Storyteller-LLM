==Powers==
Once a day for a brief period, priests with this domain could protect a limited number of allies who stayed within 10 feet (3 meters), making them more able to avoid attacks.

==Spells==
Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[bless]]'', ''[[shield other]]'', and ''[[helping hand]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[imbue with spell ability]]'', ''[[Rary's telepathic bond]]'', and ''[[heroes' feast]]''. Those that were masters of this domain had access to ''[[Refuge (spell)|refuge]]'', ''[[protection from spells]]'', and ''[[prismatic sphere]]''.
