}}'''Poseidon''' ({{Pronounce|poh|SIDE|uhn|refs = }}) was an interloper [[deity]] of waters worshiped by some in [[Impiltur]] in [[northeast Faer√ªn]]. However, like the sea, he was fickle in nature.

==Description==
Poseidon largely looked like a large, bearded [[human]].

==Personality==
This deity was very volatile, temperamental, and prone to rage. He was known to express his displeasure through extreme acts, such as flattening coastal cities with earthquakes or flooding them.

==Abilities==
Poseidon was able to perceive anything within {{SI|17|mi|k|long=yes}} of worshipers, holy sites, sacred objects, as well as any location where his name or one of his many titles had been spoken in the last hour. He could focus his senses on up to twenty locations.

Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], he was capable of ''[[command]]ing'' most non-divine aquatic creatures, ''[[conjure water elemental]]s'', and create new forms of life.

==Combat==
Poseidon generally fought with his ''+5 [[trident]]''. In addition to this [[item enchantment|enchantment]], his trident could store [[spell]]s as well as had the ''[[thundering]]'' and ''[[returning]]'' [[weapon quality|weapon qualities]].

When faced with combat he often surrounded his body in watery haze, providing him protection comparable to that of a ''+5 [[ring of protection]]''.

==Possessions==
Poseidon typically wore a tunic and carried his aforementioned a trident.

[[File:Poseidon_symbol.jpg|thumb|304x304px|''The holy symbol of Poseidon.'']]
==Realm==
Poseidon resided within [[Aquallor]], the second layer of [[Arborea]], but maintained a seaside shrine on the first layer near [[Mount Olympus]].

==History==
Poseidon was among the first six Olympians, born to the [[Greater Titan]] [[Cronus]]. After a curse was placed on him by his mother, swearing that one day his children would usurp him, Cronus proceeded to swallow Poseidon alongside four of his siblings &mdash; [[Demeter]], [[Hades (deity)|Hades]], [[Hera]], and [[Hestia]]. His sixth sibling, [[Zeus]], would be smuggled away and years later return to free them all from their imprisonment.

After this war concluded, Poseidon drew lots with his brothers Hades and Zeus to determine which of them would govern the [[portfolio]]s of sky, the sea, and death.{{Cite dragon/153/Following in their Footsteps|28}}

Poseidon went on to be the husband of Demeter for a time, eventually parting ways as he took up residence in Aquallor.

At some point Poseidon, for reasons unknown, took all the wealth of a mortal named [[Dunn]] and placed it within a temple to him in [[Sylvania]]. The temple's chief priest lured the man's wife away. And one of his proxies swept the man's daughter away to Arborea. Altogether this instilled a sense of hatred towards deities in Dunn, leading him to eventually found the organization known as [[the Athar]] and vow that one day Poseidon would die.<ref>

In the late 1350s [[DR]], twelve [[cleric]]s of Poseidon served aboard ''[[Rilaunyr's Warship]]'', which was based in [[Sarshel]]. Their duties were to heal the crew, provide supplies, and update Lord [[Rilaunyr]] on the current state of the sea and Poseidon's attitude.

==Rumors & Legends==
* Some claimed that Poseidon had created, or even fathered, the race of [[giant-kin]] known as [[cyclops|cyclopes]]. Other legends claimed that he was responsible for the creation of [[horse]]s.
* On some worlds it was believed that Poseidon had aided the god [[Deep Sashelas]] in banishing [[Panzuriel]].
