'''Kar'r'rga''' was a [[Zakharan pantheon#Savage gods|savage god]] worshiped by the [[Zakharan pantheon|non-Enlightened]] natives of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]] in [[Zakhara]]'s [[Crowded Sea]]â€”[[human]] and non-human alike.<ref>

Its special servants, also called its children, were the monstrous [[sartani]], which appeared just like their god: a giant humanoid with the head of a crab.<ref><br />

The lagoon called [[Batihat al-Saji]] in the center of the island group was sacred to Kar'r'rga. Here offerings were placed by his followers, while trespassing non-believers were said to be destroyed. The truth of the matter was that at the bottom of the lagoon a [[elemental vortices|vortex]] could open to [[Pandemonium]], where the crab god resided.
