        "text": "The skulks who lurk beneath Calimshan far to the south of Waterdeep have been there for millenia - I could not say exactly how long - and it is likely theyve migrated through long-lost gates to many worlds. We’ve determined that these skulks evolved ages ago from human captives of the drow under Calimshan, slaves who remained in the Underdark after being freed from their servitude by a giant lizard (claimed to be an avatar of lbrandul by priests of that deity as if their words could be trusted).",
        "mainbody": "Worship of Ibrandul began in the prehistory of what would later be known as Calimshan, before even the founding of the Shoon Imperium, some time after the defeat of a nomadic human tribe known as the Djen. Abducted from the Calim Desert by drow raiders from Guallidurth, the humans were kept as slaves for centuries, too afraid of the surrounding darkness to flee. Until, that is, a monstrous lizard came out of the dark, drove off the drow, and led the humans into the wild tunnels. Some of the humans returned to the surface while other remained in the Underdark and evolved into the skulks, but both nonetheless carried with them the worship of the Lord of the Dark Depths, even if each developed slightly different beliefs and representations over time.\nOver time, Ibranduls faith on the surface of Calimshan declined and the raiding of the skulks worsened his image. However, the faith of the Skulking God had also quietly spread to many places connected to the Underdark, including the Undermountain beneath Waterdeep.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Ibrandul was seen wandering in the Underdark below Undermountain however, during that period of weakness he was, unknown to his followers, slain by Shar, who took his guise and deceived his followers. She found masquerading as him quite useful, for it allowed her to subvert the worship of Selûne without drawing attention to her own nightcloaks, particularly in Waterdeep. The petrified corpse of his avatar was believed to lie at the bottom of a vast chasm in some lost level of Undermountain.\nShar reveled in the deceit of the entire affair for a time,\nDuring the events of the Second Sundering in 1486 DR, a Chosen of Ibrandul appeared, in the shape of a female drow named Ashdra. She was captured by the Red Wizards of Thay and taken to their so-called Temple of Shadows.\nIt was suspected that Ibrandul had some connection to Syrul, the Oerthan goddess of deceit worshiped by the skulks in Flanaess, although there was no evidence of any such link.\nAfter his death became clear, several beholders claimed to have slain Ibrandul, killing a god being one of the objectives of Vellurith, though these claims were universally dismissed as none were made around the time of his actual death."
