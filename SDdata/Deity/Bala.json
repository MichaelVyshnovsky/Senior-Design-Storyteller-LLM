        "mainbody": "'''Bala''' was a goddess of music in [[Zakhara]] and emphasized the importance of music to lift the spirit and mitigate suffering. She was a [[Zakharan pantheon|local goddess]] who was worshiped in the city of [[Mahabba]], but her faith was outlawed and driven underground by the [[Pantheist League|Pantheists]]. In this persecution her followers spread to other cities. Their sometimes violent resistance against their oppressors brought the goddess the epithet \"of Ill Tidings\".<br/>\n\nBala's symbol was a [[zither]].<br/>\n\nThe goddess has been described as a colorfully but modestly dressed, middle-aged woman who played her zither in a way that enchanted gods and [[genie]]s.\n\n[[Holy slayer]]s of the [[Final Chord]] followed Bala's teachings.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|25-26}}",
