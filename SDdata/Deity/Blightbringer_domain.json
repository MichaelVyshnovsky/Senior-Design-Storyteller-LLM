        "mainbody": "The Blightbringer domain was a prestige domain granted to certain divine spellcasters of Talona. It granted the power to command or rebuke blightspawned creatures, evil animals, and even evil plants, just as some evil priests could order the undead.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the hold animal, Snillocs snowball swarm, and contagion spells. Clerics of some experience could cast fear, cone of cold, and finger of death. Those that were masters of this domain had access to command plants, horrid wilting, and energy drain."
