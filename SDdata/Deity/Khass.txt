Khass was a male deity worshiped by barbarians of the Eastern Shaar.
The deity was a cloud god with multiple limbs, and palm trees were said to be his fingers.
Khass was a frustrating god to worship, because he would ignore his worshipers pleas for rain for months, and then send heavy downpours to drench them for weeks at time.
