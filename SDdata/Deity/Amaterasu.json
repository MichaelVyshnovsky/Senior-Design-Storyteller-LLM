        "mainbody": "'''Amaterasu''', also called '''Amaterasu Omikami''' and '''Light of Heaven''' and titled the '''Great Goddess of the Rising Sun''' and simply the '''Sun Goddess''', was the goddess of light and [[the sun]] (including the dawn{{Cite dungeon/33/Mad Gyoji|71}}",
        "Description": "She appeared as a beautiful [[human]] woman with, of course, a radiant smile.",
        "Personality": "Though considered fragile and to have had a limited upbringing, Amaterasu was curious and forever fascinated by the [[Prime Material Plane]] and by the [[Outer Planes]] as well. She worried about events on the Prime and sought to understand other deities of the sun. She was known to have great pride but also great gentleness.",
        "Activities": "The twin siblings Amaterasu the sun goddess and [[Tsukiyomi]] the moon god sat with their backs to one another, and thus marked the difference between day and night. Amaterasu caused solar eclipses as omens.\n\nAmaterasu weaved robes for her fellow gods to wear.",
        "Abilities": "As goddess of the sun, Amaterasu could illuminate any place in the world, cause plants to grow, and cure diseases, or destroy whatever she desired with her brilliant light. Her [[avatar]] could shoot rays of blinding heat from her eyes. She was naturally immune to fire and heat, as well as to cold, and to the [[spell]]s or ''[[darkness]]'' and ''[[light]]''. She radiated light constantly, similar to ''[[continual light]]''.\n\nShe had the power to change anything into anything else with but a touch; only other divine beings could resist this polymorphing effect. In battle, Amaterasu liked to turn creatures or weaponry that attacked her into small birds. If not, she struck with her fists.\n\nFor her magic, Amaterasu could draw from the [[All sphere|All]], [[Charm sphere|Charm]], [[Creation sphere|Creation]], [[Elemental sphere|Elemental]], and of course [[Sun sphere]]s. She was also capable of the ''[[id insinuation]]'' [[psionic]] attack.",
        "Divine Realm": "She made her home in [[Mercuria]], the second layer of [[Mount Celestia]]. The realm was called Radiant Light, and was a land of eternal soft sunlight with no shadows cast anywhere. It soothing, and sometimes even sleep-inducing, and all secret and illegal activities failed.",
        "Symbols": "[[File:Amaterasu symbol.jpg|thumb|right|''The sun holy symbol of Amaterasu.'']]\nHer [[holy symbol]] was an octagonal mirror or a depiction of a sun.\n\nShe was associated with mirrors, goldfish, and the color gold.",
        "Legends": "After the god [[Nagikami]] returned from meeting [[Namikami]] in the Land of Darkness, he cleaned off the residue of the [[Underworld]], which produced new deities. When he washed his left eye, the sun goddess Amaterasu was born.\n\nHer brother Susano once played a prank on Amaterasu so cruel that she fled into a cave to hide. This act deprived the world of light and led to Susano being sorely punished.\n\nNagikami presented an island in an enchanted lake on [[Shinkoku]] as a gift to Amaterasu. The sun goddess turned it into a beautiful green land for her people to love. Many shrines to the Eight Million Gods were erected there, the greatest of them being the Temple of Amaterasu; for this, it was called [[Miyashima]], meaning \"Temple Island\".\n\nThe Sun Goddess once hurled a flaming coal into the lake of [[Nora-ko]] on the island of Shinkoku. Shortly after, the mysterious island of [[Norijo]] arose.",
        "Relationships": "Amaterasu was the daughter of Nagikami and Namikami, the founders of the pantheon. She was the twin sister of Tsukiyomi, the moon god, and sister to Susano. Amaterasu was the mother of her pantheon, and the greatest of them alongside Susano and Tsukiyomi.While the parent gods are named Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology and core D&D sources, Kara-Tur sources call them Nagikami and Namikami, respectively. Their stories appear too similar to treat them as separate entities, and many other Japanese deities appear under their own names. Therefore, for consistency, this wiki assumes they are the same and adopts the latter names.\n\nShe had a number of children and grandchildren,\n\nThrough her grandchildren, some mortal emperors of the [[Prime Material Plane]] (such as Japan on [[Earth]]) were descendants of Amaterasu and thus took the title \"Son of Light\". In particular, the [[Akimatsu]] emperors of Kozakura were said to be direct descendants of Amaterasu, via the earlier Earth Spirit emperors, and were thus living gods themselves.{{Cite dungeon/33/Mad Gyoji|68}}\n\nBy the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], Amaterasu had established relations with fellow sun deities [[Ra]] and [[Apollo]], while the gods of the [[Lords of Creation]] also began to take an interest in her.",
