The Cold domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with cold-themed spells and powers.
The spellcaster gained the ability to turn away and destroy fire creatures the way a good cleric turned undead, and to rebuke, command, and strengthen cold creatures the way an evil cleric rebuked undead.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the chill touch, chill metal, and sleet storm spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ice storm, wall of ice, and cone of cold. Those that were masters of this domain had access to control weather, polar ray, and obedient avalanche.
