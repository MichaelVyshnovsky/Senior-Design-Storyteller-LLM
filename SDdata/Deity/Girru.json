        "Description": "Girru manifested as a [[human]] male. He could shapeshift at will and teleport himself into nearby flames. It was impossible to approach him without taking damage from his intense heat. He fought with a mace that had an unlimited number of poisoned barbs that broke off in the wounds it made. He also fought with an axe. Any weapon that touched his body would disintegrate, though after causing damage.",
        "History": "Girru presumedly came to [[Toril]] with the other Untheric deities aboard the ''[[Galley of the Gods]]''. He was killed by one of the [[orc pantheon|orcish gods]] in {{Yearlink|-1071}}, and his body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in [[Unther]].",
