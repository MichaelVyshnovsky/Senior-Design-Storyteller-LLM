'''Bright Nydra''' ({{Pronounce|BRIGHT|_|NIGH|dra|refs=}}) was a [[demigod]] and later an aspect of [[Selûne]].

==Description==
Nydra had two [[avatar]]s, one was a pale-skinned [[human]] woman, wrapped from head to toe in a [[toga]] of her own silver hair. Said skin was tinged with blue highlights. Her eyes were noted to have a strange focus about them, as if concentrating on things that were no longer apparent. She is also noted as having a fey-like beauty.

Her other avatar was that of a shaft of bright moonlight run through with silver ''[[faerie fire]]''.

==Personality==
Bright Nydra was noted as being a caring deity, but her emotions changed with the phases of the moon. When she was upset, she would put on a cheery and hopeful facade.

==Divine Realm==
Nydra had no divine realm, as she dwelled bodily upon [[Toril]].

==Activities==
Nydra appeared to those who were depressed and/or lost. She would attempt to cheer them up and lead the lost home. When mortals had earned her favor, she placed tear-shaped diamonds for them to find.

==Relationships==
Bright Nydra was allied with [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]], [[Lathander]], and [[Mielikki]] - all of whom are part of the pantheon of deities led by Nydra who were worshiped by the Marsh Drovers.

She counted [[Auril]] as an enemy.

==History==
Nydra was said to have been the daughter of Selûne and [[Shaundakul]], who fell to [[Faerûn]] from the [[Tears of Selûne]],{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom|51}} supposedly in the 4th century Dalereckoning on a [[midwinter]] night. She appeared as a human woman to refugees fleeing a [[goblinoid]] horde in the [[High Moors]] north of the [[Storm Horns]], leading them west into the [[Farsea Marshes]] where they would became the Marsh Drovers.

At some point after this, Selûne absorbed her divine essence, making Nydra an aspect of herself rather than a separate entity.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], after escaping his imprisonment in [[High Horn (hold)|High Horn]], Nydra is said to have defeated the avatar of [[Bhaal]] and driven him out of the Farsea Marshes while he was pursuing [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]].
