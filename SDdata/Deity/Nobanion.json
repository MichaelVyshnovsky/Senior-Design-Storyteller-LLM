        "adjective": "Nobanionite",
        "mainbody": "'''Nobanion''' ({{Pronounce|no|BAN|yun|refs=<ref>}}) was a [[primal spirit]]{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|61}} sometimes worshiped as a [[deity]] of royalty, [[lion]]s, and other [[Cat|felines]], as well as good beasts. The '''Lion King''' was considered to have originally been an interloper deity on [[Toril]], but since his arrival he has firmly established himself within the [[Faer没nian pantheon]]. Worship of the '''King of Beasts''' was especially strong in [[Gulthmere Forest]] and among the [[wemic]]s of the [[Shining Plains]].",
        "Description": "Nobanion took the form of a great male lion of at least twice their normal size (somewhere between {{SIrange|12|17|ft|long=yes}} long) with a coat that gleamed with the radiance of the sun. His title of \"Lord Firemane\" came from his ability to ignite his thick, luxurious mane in a nimbus of amber and golden fire. He could sprout the wings of a gigantic [[eagle]] at will.\n\nRadiating a powerful, yet gentle presence, Nobanion possessed a majesty and charisma that was overwhelming at times, yet even the smallest of animals that approached him in good faith felt comfortable around him.",
        "Personality": "[[File:Nobanion symbol.jpg|thumb|''The holy symbol of Nobanion.'']]\nLord Firemane led his faithful along a noble path without force or coercion. He genuinely wanted his pride to willingly choose benevolent and good actions over the alternatives by their own accord.\n\nNobanion was a deity of virtue, who would never take the rear in command or ask another to take an action that he himself would not, including the sacrifice of their own life.",
        "Divine Realm": "In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Nobanion made his [[divine realm]] called the [[Pridelands]] in [[Krigala]], the sunlit first layer of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]. After the [[Time of Troubles]], the Lion King established a permanent ''[[portal]]'' from here to the [[Gulthmere Forest]], and from then on prowled both [[Faer没n]] and the Happy Hunting Grounds.",
        "Relationships": "The Lion King has long shared a strong alliance with [[Lurue]], and he counted her as his closest friend. He was on good terms with most of the Faer没nian pantheon's nature deities, particularly [[Mielikki]]; [[Shiallia]]; and [[Silvanus]], as well as some minor powers of the Beastlands, such as [[Balador]]; [[Ferrix]]; [[Tapann]]; and [[Water Lion]]. [[Tyr]] and [[Torm]] saw Nobanion as a cordial acquaintance, but where Nobanion tried to emulate them, and forge a deeper bond, they were just too busy with human affairs to be overly concerned with his feline ones. Nobanion and [[Sharess]] were allied through their shared affinity for cats and their feline natures, but he was frequently annoyed with her lack of focus and constant flirting. [[Gwaeron Windstrom]] was a frequent comrade in opposing [[Malar]], whom Nobanion saw as a perversion of nature.\n\nAll [[lammasu]] on [[Toril]], both greater and lesser, were believed to be his offspring.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "History": "Nobanion was an interloper deity, having only established a presence on Toril around the mid 1000's [[DR]]. Ancient texts referred to him as ''Aslan'', and some legends claimed he entered the Realms through one of the magical pools in the [[Weathercote Wood]]. After wandering Faer没n for a little over a hundred years, he settled in the Gulthmere Forest with a tribe of lammasu. He was responsible for driving most of Malar's worshipers out of the surrounding Vilhon Reach, which earned the promise of vengeance from the Beastlord. Malar did indeed attack Nobanion during the Time of Troubles, in a battle known as the '''Roar of Shadows''' but had to flee from the fury of Firemane and his [[Emerald Enclave]] allies. Afterward, Nobanion traveled to [[Shaar|the Shaar]], where he fostered his own worship among some of the wemic tribes there, particularly the [[Tenpaw]] tribe. After the Godswar ended, Nobanion created his ''portal'' to his divine realm.\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]], Nobanion tried to save a pride of lions in [[Gulthandor]] from oncoming [[blue fire]]. He came in contact with the blue fire, and it mutated him into a dark and bestial lion with a mane of blue flame. In this state, he was held in subjugation by Malar. In [[1486 DR]], he was tasked by Malar to capture [[Stedd Whitehorn]], the boy Chosen of [[Lathander]], but Stedd and his companions healed him of his corruption by blue fire. He returned to his natural state, and introduced himself to Stedd and his companions. In his reinstated form, he was no longer under Malar's control. He guided the young Chosen through the wilds of Gulthandor. They parted ways just before Stedd and company entered Turmish.<ref>"
