The Evil domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with evil spells and powers.
Their evil spells gained potency.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the protection from good, desecrate, and magic circle against good spells. Clerics of some experience could cast unholy blight, dispel good, and create undead. Those that were masters of this domain had access to blasphemy, unholy aura, and summon monster IX.
