Elikarashae was a warrior-deity of the Yuir pantheon.
Elikarashae was said to have wielded three great weapons Shama, a spear that could speak to elven warriors of pure heart and noble mind Ukava, a sling that never missed and Maelat, a club that could only be wielded in the defense of the Yuir.
Elikarashae was worshiped by the Yuir elves, but vanished during the decline of the Yuir.
The Temple of the Yuir Gods featured a wooden statue of Elikarashae.
Elikarashae was said to have once been a mortal elven warrior of the Yuir who fought many of the Yuirs enemies before ascending to Arvandor and becoming a deity.
It was said, as of 1368 DR, that there were stirrings that some said heralded the return of the Yuir gods.
