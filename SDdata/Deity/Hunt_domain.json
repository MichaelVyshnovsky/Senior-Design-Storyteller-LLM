        "mainbody": "The Hunt domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with hunting related spells and powers.\nClerics of this domain were made as capable as most rangers at finding and following tracks.\nAs they advanced, a priest with this domain could navigate themselves almost anywhere by commune with nature, discern location, locate creature, and find the path. They could prepare for any predator or prey with foresight and snare. If forced to evade an enemy the priest could always hide from animals or control weather. And if forced to confront their enemy, a priest could give themselves bears endurance."
