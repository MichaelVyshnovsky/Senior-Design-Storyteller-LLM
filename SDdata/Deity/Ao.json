In that instance, he took the form of a cryptic and incredibly imposing being, towering over {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} tall. Otherwise however, the Overpower's appearance reflected his nature as a being of balance. He was  ageless (neither young nor old), and had a beard and hair of purest white with an absolutely average visage, even and symmetrical, neither pleasant nor unpleasant. He wore a black robe dotted by millions of stars and moons, arranged in a not-quite-perceptible pattern but which had a beautiful and harmonious feel.",
        "Personality": "{{fq\n|text= Ao would see that which sets us all apart from the beasts: the magnificence of deed and achievement, love and friendship and aiding one another-that which soars above mere survival. And so, of course, ye come into the picture.\n|source= Elminster\n| width  = 300px\n}}\n\nAo held himself aloof from most events as an eternal, rarely-interfering observer. and did not care to be challenged on his verdicts.  He did not see every divine role as beneficial to its bearer, and indeed might even grant godhood as a form of penalty. and some theorized that he didn't want to be known by them.\n\nDespite his deliberate indifference, Ao was not emotionless. Even he was known to smile upon exceptional oration, and could be impressed by a great act of self-sacrifice, being known to bring back deities when they died in service to their ethos.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|162-163}} In contrast, he was angered by petty behavior and pointless demands for self-destructive displays from mortals for their own aggrandizement.\n\nIt was unclear if Ao was omniscient, with everything that occurred being according to his grand designs, if his plans merely followed the general trajectory he aimed for, or if he could be outright mistaken, if his plans could do more harm than good and the Overgod would be compelled to change his mind.",
        "Powers": {
            "Weaknesses": "Ao's powers were also limited to the [[crystal sphere|sphere]] of Abeir-Toril, and he could not control or influence something from beyond it.\n\nThough Ao was considered to be more powerful than all the other gods in Toril, able to confine them all to avatar-like forms, Even more pressingly, by some sources, [[Mystra]] was an overgoddess in waiting, and were it in her nature to desire such power, she may have had the capacity to claim such a position.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 13186\n| postid     = \n| whichpage  = 50\n| date       = 2010-06-16\n| accessdate = 2022-12-31\n}}\n\nGiven that overdeities became stronger when more deities were under their dominion, the outright decrease of gods would not be helpful to him. His punishment during the Time of Troubles might have played a part in the Torilian gods seeking to expand into the [[Outer Plane]]s, and it was not uncommon (if incredibly risky) for gods that suffered under despotic overgods to simply abandon their area of control all together."

Ao existed both to ensure the deities within his purview abided by the rules of the cosmos\n\nAnother of his functions was to decide which interloper deities were allowed in the sphere of Abeir-Toril and which mortals could be raised to godhood. If Ao didn't allow it, a being could not ascend to divinity, and an interloper deity could not enter the sphere or affect it in any way, regardless of how powerful it was.\n\nAo established rules concerning the management of the divine.<ref>{{cite web|url=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020625093618/http://www.geocities.com:80/TimesSquare/Castle/2566/eb-pantheons.htm|archivedate=2002-06-25|author=[[Eric L.

The cult was more philosophical than religious in nature.\n\nAmong the known cults of Ao were a [[Cynosure (building)|cult in Waterdeep]], and another in [[Zazesspur]], [[Tethyr]]. This cult was remarkable for the fact that its ministers could cast [[Divine magic|divine]] spells, but in the end it was revealed that those individuals received their divine powers from [[Cyric]] and not from Ao.\n\nThe gods of the established faiths of Faerûn informed their [[priest]]s about the fact that Ao did not interact with mortals. Because of this, members of other faiths neither feared nor spoke out against the cults of Ao.",
        "History": {
            "Creation of the World": "There were no exact accounts on how he created the universe, but nonetheless he was credited for the deed. In other accounts, it was Ao who directly created all that exists, not only Realmspace, but also the worlds and heavenly bodies, and even the [[Astral Sea]], using the raw energy of the [[phlogiston]]. Ao himself claimed to be the creator of the gods, though not of the Realms themselves.",
            "The Tearfall": "During the [[Days of Thunder]], when the [[batrachi]] were losing their war against the [[titan]]s, they performed a powerful summoning [[ritual]] and released several primordials from their ancient prisons. The gods quickly moved against their ancient foes, and those battles caused the worldwide catastrophes that destroyed the batrachi civilization. A primordial known as \"[[Asgorath]] the World-Shaper\", determined to destroy the world if she couldn't control it, threw an ice moon at the planet, creating the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. This event was known as the [[Tearfall]]. \n\nBefore the world was completely destroyed, Lord Ao intervened and sundered the original world of [[Abeir-Toril]] into two twin worlds, Abeir and Toril, giving the former to the primordials and the latter (the original world) to the gods, ending the conflict. The [[Tablets of Fate]] were created by Ao after the Tearfall as a way to maintain the new worlds of Abeir and Toril apart, and to ensure a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, as well as between the gods and the primordials.",
            "The Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons": "When the [[Imaskar]]i captured the ancestors of the [[Mulan]] peoples from another [[Earth|world]] and brought them to Toril, Ao contacted the ancient being [[Ptah]], and invited the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] and [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric]] gods to manifest in Toril. With help and permission from Ao, these deities were able to follow their worshipers and end their servitude.",
            "The Time of Troubles": "{{fq\n|text= I created gods to serve the Balance, not to twist it to your own ends. But this point was lost on you. You saw the tablets as a set of rules by which to play juvenile games of prestige and pomp. Then when the rules became inconvenient, you stole them.\n|source= Ao regarding his stolen tablets.\n| width  = 300px\n}}\n\nIn [[1358 DR]], the gods [[Bane]] and [[Myrkul]] stole the Tablets of Fate from Ao and hid them in Faerûn, wrongly suspecting that some of the Overgod's power was derived from these tablets. When Ao discovered the Tablets of Fate were missing he summoned all the deities and asked for those guilty to hand them over. When no one stood forward to admit to stealing the Tablets of Fate, Ao cast down all the gods from the heavens, taking their divine power in the process. He stated the reason for this was primarily that he was displeased with the gods treating the world as if it was for their own amusement, rather than the purpose they were created, though the theft of the Tablets were part of it. Ao tasked [[Helm]] with guarding the [[Celestial Stairway]]s that would lead the deities back into their divine realms.<ref>\n\n[[Luna]], the [[avatar]] of [[Selûne]], who'd already been dwelling in [[Waterdeep]] as a mortal before the other gods were cast down and had missed these events, believed Ao responsible for the gods' turmoil. She informed her friend [[Kyriani]] of the One Who Is Hidden, but no more than that. Somehow, [[Khelben Arunsun]] knew more about Ao and he explained to Kyriani that Ao had brought order out of chaos so that the world could exist and had assigned the gods their parts in the balance of nature, which were inscribed upon the Tablets of Fate. However, known to few mortals, the gods had come to neglect their duties and fallen out of favor with Ao, leading to dissension and chaos.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|15-16}}\n\nAfter valiant heroes (among them the mortals [[Cyric]], [[Kelemvor]], and [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]]) recovered the Tablets of Fate and returned them to Ao, the Overgod himself destroyed the Tablets of Fate, grinding them into powder. Though the Tablets had been returned, by then, as Ao had seen it, the gods had proven they were indiffirent to their actual duties. This act however, while meant to teach them a lesson, unraveled the laws of Realmspace, beginning the chaotic [[Era of Upheaval]].\n\nMany cults of Ao arose after the Time of Troubles, but disappeared as quickly in the following years. By [[1372 DR]], even written records about Ao had disappeared, and by [[1479 DR]] all the cults of Ao had vanished from Faerûn altogether.",
