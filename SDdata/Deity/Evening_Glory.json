        "mainbody": "Evening Glory, called the Deathless Beauty and the Eternal Lover, was a goddess of love, beauty, and immortality through undeath.\nEvening Glory appeared as an exquisitely preserved, but necrotically chilly, woman with platinum-white, neck-length hair and ice-white, almost translucent, skin. Her eyes, lips, and nails were baby blue in color, and her hands had a bloodless, heart-shaped hole in the palm of each. She wore elaborate backless dresses.\nShe taught that desire, love, was all that mattered, and that the longing for love of another should not be allowed to fail because of age. That those whose love transcended life, should seek to preserve, to freeze, their love through undeath.\nEvening Glory was primarily worshiped by undead those living who worshiped her normally became undead after a short time. Those who sought immortality were drawn to her teachings, and anyone who had loved and lost or who had love and feared losing it were potential worshipers.\nThe clerics of Evening Glory were mostly proselytizers who preached about the continuance of love. Their training was a \"secret cloaked in love and affection.\" Temples to Evening Glory could show up anywhere, but were typically banned once authorities learned of her faiths close association with undead.\nThere were many rites of the Deathless Beauty, but at the least, the simple recitation of a love poem inspired by her was considered a daily obligation of her followers. Prayers to her always extolled her unchanging perfection beauty frozen at its height by undeath.\nEvening Glory normally sent a female lich as her herald, and her planar allies were rather large fire elementals.\nAt some point in the ancient past of Barovia, before it had become a Domain of Dread &mdash in Faer√ªnian terms, sometime before the 11 century DR &mdash Evening Glory was imprisoned in a structure known as the Amber Temple as a vestige within an amber sarcophagus by a secret society of wizards. In the years following Barovias transplantation into the Domains of Dread, Evening Glorys alignment shifted more towards evil and she adopted \"obsessed love\" into her portfolio. She gradually warped the minds of the wizards who had imprisoned her."
