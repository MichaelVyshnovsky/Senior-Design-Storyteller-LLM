'''Ssharstrune''' was a [[deity]] worshiped by [[naga]]s that became an aspect of [[Shekinester]]. He embodied the power-hungry, covetous nature of some nagas,

Ssharstrune was venerated by [[dark naga]]s. His cult was known to be prevalent in [[Najara]].<ref> The ruined city of [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]], once the capital of Najara, was originally built as a temple-city by his cult, but was abandoned after his death. The [[Shrine of Cowled Serpents]], a major temple to the god, layed at its heart.<ref>

==History==
Ssharstrune was originally a facet of the World Serpent that became a deity in his own right when the Great Scaled One fractured. He was, at the time, one of the two deities that the nagas worshiped, the other being the Naga Queen [[Shekinester]]. After the World Serpent fractured and died, he and another facet-turned-deity, [[Jazirian]], began to court Shekinester. When the Naga Queen chose Jazirian over Ssharstrune and became pregnant, Ssharstrune attacked her in a rage, forcing her to swallow him whole.

This inadvertently caused Shekinester to absorb the same destructive power that had torn the World Serpent apart, and she developed five different guises. After she gave birth to her son [[Parrafaire]], however, she expelled Ssharstrune's destructive remains and told Parrafaire to hide it away, lest she truly fracture into five separate deities. He complied, and the two had been the gods of the nagas ever since, Ssharstrune reduced to but another of the Queen's many faces.

===Recent History===
In the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, the lich [[Druth Daern]] used a complex deception to impersonate Ssharstrune after a fashion, in order to take control of the [[Cult of the Dark Naga]]. He guided them to create a small army of [[undead]] nagas and fight the [[devil]]s for control of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] after severely weakening the [[phaerimm]] who had subtly led them there in the first place. It would likely only be a matter of time before they had the magic to discover the deception, though in truth, the revelation that their god was not real would change little but add the lich to their list of beings to destroy.<ref>
