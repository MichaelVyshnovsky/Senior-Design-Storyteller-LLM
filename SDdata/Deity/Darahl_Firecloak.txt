'''Darahl Tilvenar''', also known as '''Darahl Firecloak''', was a minor [[elf|elven]] [[deity|god]] of [[Earth (element)|earth]] and [[fire]] [[magic]].

==Activities==
Darahl spent a good deal of time attempting to regain his lost power and gain more followers. Since he wasn't very picky about converts, he tried to sway more neutrally aligned members of the [[Underdark]] races to him.

==Relationships==
Darahl Firecloak was a member of the [[Seldarine]], but was largely estranged from that pantheon. He remained friends only with [[Tarsellis Meunniduin]] and [[Tethrin Verald√©]].

He was allied with other gods whose portfolios were associated with earth and fire magic, such as the [[Dwarf|dwarven]] god [[Dumathoin]] and several of the [[Gnome pantheon|gnomish powers]].

His various activities also earned him a variety of enemies: as a member of the Seldarine he was opposed to the [[Dark Seldarine|drow]] and [[goblinoid]] deities, but he also earned the ire of [[Laduguer]] and [[Urdlen]], and angered both [[Lolth]] and [[Selvetarm]].

==History==
Darahl Firecloak was once an [[Intermediate deity|intermediate god]] known as '''Tilvenar''', and served the god [[Rillifane Rallathil]]. However, an incident with an ancient artifact caused several of his avatars to go mad, causing them to go on a destructive rampage. Although his avatars were eventually cured, many elves forsook him, and he fell to demipower status.

He eventually left [[Arvandor]] to live in [[Arcadia]] instead, and renamed himself "Darahl Firecloak". In attempts to regain his status as an intermediate power, he forged ties with other deities outside the Seldarine, and sought to convert other peoples besides elves.
