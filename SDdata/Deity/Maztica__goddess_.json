        "mainbody": "aztica () was one of the two elder deities in the Maztican pantheon. She was the mother of the gods, and the goddess of the earth and life itself. Some sages speculated that she was an overgod.\nShe was considered the epitome of fertile womanhood and therefore she was shown as a lush and full woman with a round and always-smiling face. Maztica was also the embodiment of the land itself in a way.\nMaztica was the wife of the god Kukul, and the mother of Qotal, Zaltec, Azul, Tezca, Plutoq, Kiltzi, Watil, and Nula. After Zaltec gave the humans hishna magic, she was saddened at the suffering they brought upon themselves, so she helped her eldest son, Qotal, create pluma magic, which brought peace to the humans. However, Zaltec was furious at her for that and rose up and struck her down with his maca, after which she was not heard from again.\nMazticas priests were much like druids, and were most often found as shamans in small tribes. The city-dwelling Mazticans and priests of other gods tended to ignore her. However, the Dog People in the northern desert worshiped her and her son Tezca more than other deities."
