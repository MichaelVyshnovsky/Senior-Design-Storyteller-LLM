        "Description": "She was considered the epitome of fertile womanhood and therefore she was shown as a lush and full woman with a round and always-smiling face. Maztica was also the embodiment of the land itself in a way.",
        "History": "Maztica was the wife of the god [[Kukul]], and the mother of [[Qotal]], [[Zaltec]], [[Azul]], [[Tezca]], [[Plutoq]], [[Kiltzi]], [[Watil]], and [[Nula]]. After Zaltec gave the humans [[hishna|hishna magic]], she was saddened at the suffering they brought upon themselves, so she helped her eldest son, Qotal, create [[pluma|pluma magic]], which brought peace to the humans. However, Zaltec was furious at her for that and rose up and struck her down with his ''maca'', after which she was not heard from again.",
        "Worship": "Maztica's priests were much like druids, and were most often found as shamans in small tribes. The city-dwelling Mazticans and priests of other gods tended to ignore her. However, the [[Dog People]] in the northern desert worshiped her and her son Tezca more than other deities."
