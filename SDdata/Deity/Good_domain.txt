The Good domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with good spells and powers.
Their good spells gained potency.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the protection from evil, aid, and magic circle against evil spells. Clerics of some experience could cast holy smite, dispel evil, and blade barrier. Those that were masters of this domain had access to holy word, holy aura, and summon monster IX (good only).
