        "mainbody": "Grazzt was the demon prince of pleasure, decadence, and unlimited self-indulgence, as well as the patron of corrupt authorities and tyrants who would rule by force. He ruled the 45, 46, and 47 layers of the Abyss, known as Azzagrat or the Triple Realm. his existence a warning that not all that was beautiful was also good. All things were but playthings in the eyes of the Prince of Pleasure, he simply hadnt claimed them yet.\nthumb|left|250px|Grazzt in all his handsome glory.\nStanding  tall, Grazzt appeared as a lithe, muscular large humanoid. His skin shone like polished obsidian and his eyes glittered with malevolent green light. He had yellowed fangs, pointed ears, and six slender fingers decorating each hand. He was sometimes described as having six small black horns half-hidden amid his thick black hair. These fiendish traits were apparent, regardless of whatever form Grazzt chose to take. He was considered the comeliest demon in the Abyss, and dressed in the most expensive and elegant finery on the entire plane.\nright|thumb|Grazzt and Iggwilv.\nWielding an acid-drenched greatsword in one hand and a profane tower shield in the other, the Dark Prince was a veritable killing machine when loosed upon the hordes of the Abyss. Whats more, he had a vast repertoire of magical abilities at his disposal, making him a deadly magical opponent. Grazzts greatest weapons, however, were his mastery of seduction and guile. He entertained the notion that he was the most cunning and intelligent creature in the Abyss indeed, there were few who could possibly contest such a claim.\nAlthough he had not yet achieved divine status, Grazzt was worshiped on the Material Plane by many monstrous races, most notably the lamias. Many of his high priests, known as the Chosen, were female, and the rituals they performed were violent and involved themes of darkness and betrayal.\nThe Dark Prince was a deeply sexual, erotic being. He was known on many worlds only in legend, as a dark figure who visited witches and sorcerers, granting them sexual favors as well as magical powers.\nIn the , Grazzt and Ayanna Orgolath had twin half-fiendish sons, named Ulthas and Ulthar. They would overthrow the lich-king of Narfell, Belevan the Unliving, and give rise to the Orgolath Dynasty.\nthumb|right|250px|Grazzt and Iggwilv.\nFor a time, Grazzt was trapped on the Material Plane world of Oerth by the witch-queen Iggwilv, who used his insight to elevate her own power. Eventually, however, she succumbed to the Dark Princes charms. Grazzt ultimately returned to the Abyss, but rumors abounded that he did, in fact, fall in love with his captor. A son, Iuz, was born of their union.\nSome sources claimed that Grazzt was the creator of the Vasharans, a breed of vilely evil humans. Deemed cruel and soulless by the gods who created him, the Vasharans ancestor was destroyed... but Grazzt breathed new life into the corpse, long before he attained his present status. It was a terrifying legacy, for the Vasharans were obsessed with deicide, and destroying all gods became the reason for their existence.\nGrazzt was always attended by six powerful lamias, and his marilith escorts, Unhath and Reluhantis, were never far from his side. Bodaks and similar horrors were found in his Argent Palace.\nTechnically, every demon living within Grazzts world-spanning empire was considered one of his loyal servants those who proved otherwise were fed to the carnivorous plants in his perfumed hanging gardens. Noteworthy minions included a hulking goristro named Orwantz, who acted as Grazzts personal border control for Azzagrat, and Rule-of-Three, a cambion who met secretly with other fiends of the Lower Planes, to strategize an attack against the celestials.\nGrazzts most powerful servant was a mysterious, hyper-intelligent demon named Verin. Like Grazzt, Verin appeared almost human, but his skin was deathly pale, and he constantly oozed spiritual slime. Verin could change his form at will, and often created a black-skinned mirror image of himself, known as Ztefano. He served as the Dark Princes majordomo and chief ambassador to the other demon lords.\nThe god Raxivort was once a servant of the Dark Prince.\nthumb|250px|Grazzt \"hosting\" Waukeen in the Abyss.\nThrough his own schemings and mischief, Grazzt became the chief enemy of Waukeen, a goddess of wealth and merchantry. During the Time of Troubles, the deity bargained for safe passage across Zelatar with information regarding a secret horde of treasure. Grazzt readily accepted the offer, but betrayed Waukeen as soon as she arrived in the Abyss. Imprisoned in the Argent Palace, the goddess was forced to witness profane celebrations held in her honor.\nGrazzt warred with many other lords of the Abyss as well, including Baphomet and Yeenoghu. Thanks to the efforts of his son Athux, he overthrew the demon prince Adimarchus, who ruled Occipitus, the 507 layer of the Abyss.\nleft|thumb|Grazzt and Tasha.\nOne of Grazzts most confusing enemies was the witch queen Iggwilv (a.k.a. Tasha). The two had been both lovers and bitter enemies over many years.\nTwo of Grazzts other greatest enemies were Malcanthet, Queen of the Succubi, and Gwynharwyf, champion of the eladrin. His conflict with the former ended up involving Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath, who swore revenge against Grazzt for humiliating him, although Grazzt himself did not consider the upstart demon lord as much of a threat.\nthumb|Grazzt facing valiant heroes in the Abyss.\nThere were several competing, often contradictory theories as to Grazzts origin, some of which claimed that he was not a native to the Abyss, but was once an archdevil who served Asmodeus. In one of these theories, Grazzt was chosen to lead an invasion of the Abyss as part of the Blood War&mdashand conquered three layers of the Abyss&mdashbut became corrupted by the chaotic forces he had been sent to destroy and renounced his allegiance to the devils.\nYet another theory suggested that Grazzt was one of several demonic children of Pale Night, sired after the fall of the obyriths this would make him the brother of several other demons, including Lupercio, Vucarik, Rhyxali, and Zivorgian. Those who subscribed to this theory believed that Pale Night must have drawn some great evil entity to herself to father her children suggestions for what this entity could have been included an evil god such as Set, a baernoloth, the patriarch of a race of immortal warriors from another reality, an Outer God of Crawling Chaos, and even a sentient portion of the Abyss itself. Some maintained that Asmodeus was drawn from the Nine Hells to mate with Pale Night, implying that there may be truth in both theories.\nDuring the , on 15 Nightal, Grazzt was summoned to the Underdark below the Earthfast Mountains near the Masters Library, due to a ritual performed by Gromph Baenre that was originally meant to summon and bind Demogorgon, but which failed and instead summoned several Demon Lords in various locations throughout the Underdark. In this location, he subdued a force of Zhentarim."
