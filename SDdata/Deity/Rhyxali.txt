'''Rhyxali''', called the '''Queen of Shadow Demons''' and the '''Demon Princess of Shadow''', was a [[demon lord]] who claimed to rule over the [[shadow demon]]s. She was also associated with secrets.

==Description==
Rhyxali was normally an incorporeal form, but her true form, which few saw and lived to speak of, was a tall humanoid female with jet-black skin and six fingers on each hand.

==Personality==
Rhyxali preferred to keep a low profile in Abyssal politics, disliking open combat but valuing information, especially secrets. She had little care for mortals, seeing them only as commodities like livestock.

==Divine Realm==
Rhyxali ruled the 49{{th}} layer of the [[Abyss]], [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 49: Shaddanon|Shaddanon]].

==Activities==
According to rumor, Rhyxali was helping Graz'zt prepare the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 48: Skeiqulac, the Ocean of Tears|Nerebdian Vast]], the 48{{th}} layer of the Abyss and the one that separated her realm from Graz'zt triple realm, for him to pull an entire Material world into in and conquer it as a fourth realm.

Otherwise, Rhyxali seemed content to rule Shaddanon alone and increase her power through the trade of souls and secrets.

==Relationships==
Rhyxali was one of the children of [[Pale Night]], making her the sister of [[Graz'zt]], [[Lupercio]], [[Vucarik]], and Zivorgian. Of her siblings, she was a close ally of Graz'zt.{{Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince}}

Rhyxali's second in command was a [[marilith]] sorcerer called [[Viractuth]], who organized all the knowledge and secrets gathered by the shadow demons into her vast, shadowy library, which was full of hand-written tomes only she could read. The library's organization pattern was such that only Viractuth understood it and could find anything in it.

Additionally, Rhyxali was normally accompanied by a large shadow demon bodyguard called [[Kadasha]].

==Worshipers==
Rhyxali did not have a large cult, as she did not seek mortal worship nor notice its absence. Nonetheless, some few ruined temple in remote locales held services in her name. Undead [[shadow]]s were also known to worship her.
