The '''Avarice domain''' was a suite of [[spell]]s that were granted by deities whose portfolios concerned covetous greed and unbridled desire for knowledge, wealth, or possessions. [[Cleric]]s of the Avarice domain gained the ability to sense the most valuable thing in the monetary sense, or at least its direction when they had no visual contact to it, within 30 feet (9 meters) of themselves.{{Cite dragon/323/Seven Deadly Domains|63}}

During the latter part of the [[Era of Upheaval]], priests who chose this domain had access to the following [[spell]]s as they grew stronger. Novice spellcasters were able to use the ''[[sticky fingers]]'', ''[[treasure scent]]'', and ''[[locate object]]'' spells. Clerics of some experience could cast ''[[shrink item]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', and ''[[Leomund's secret chest]]''. Those that were masters in this domain had access to ''[[sequester]]'', ''[[discern location]]'', and ''[[antipathy]]''.
