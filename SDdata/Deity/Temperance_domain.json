        "mainbody": "The Temperance domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with temperance-related spells and powers.\nWhen preparing spells for the day, any domain spell that was unused on the previous day granted the priest healing in proportion to the level of the spell (the more difficult the spell, the more health was restored).\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the remove fear, calm emotions, and dispel magic spells. Clerics of some experience could cast neutralize poison, atonement, and greater dispel magic. Those that were masters in this domain had access to symbol of stunning, shield of law, and iron body."
