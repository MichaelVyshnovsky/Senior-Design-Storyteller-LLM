Watil was the Maztican goddess of plant life and agriculture.
Watil was often portrayed as a human lady of ample womanhood. She wore green leaves as clothing with a belt and sandals of flowers. She was also able to take the form of any kind of plant.
Watil was the second daughter of Kukul and Maztica. She sided with her sisters and Qotal against Zaltec, but later fled to Zaltecs protection after Qotal slept with Kiltzi.
Watil was considered a benign power, but also as a helpless pawn of Azul. She is often praised when fruit is harvested, as that is considered to be her greatest blessing. Her priests bless the fields at planting and harvest time, but no sacrifices are performed in her name. Many of her priests live alone in the jungles and swamps, where they study and care for plants.
