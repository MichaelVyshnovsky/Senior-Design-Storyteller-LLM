Ed did, however, provide additional fluff and crunch over at the Candlekeep forums found [http//forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3690&whichpage=2&SearchTerms=Auppenser here]. was a stoic god, and the precepts of his worship included moderation, inner balance, self-reflection, and reason.\nHis church reached its heights in Jhaamdath - primarily in the Twelve Cities of Swords - before its imperial expansion. At this time in Jhaamdath, the Twelve Cities were ruled by a psiocracy of bladelords (cleric psions) who considered the perfection of both mind and body of the highest importance.\nThe Elven High Magic that destroyed Jhaamdath, also severely injured Auppenser by wiping out the vast majority of his worshipers, and his faith simply fell into obscurity over the next few hundred years. Only a few devotees of Auppenser remained as of 1374 DR."
