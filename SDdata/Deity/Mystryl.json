        "mainbody": "Mystryl (\nLegend has it that at the dawn of time Lord Ao created the universe, and out of the early chaos came twin deities Shar of the darkness and Selûne of the light. Together, these two beings created the spheres in the firmament, one of which was the world of Abeir-Toril and its spirit, Chauntea. Chauntea desired new and more abundant life for her world and asked the sisters for light and warmth in order to nurture it. In this, the two beings could not agree. Selûne eventually acted on her own and gave Toril a sun, which Shar immediately sought to put out, thus beginning the battle between light and darkness that raged for eons.\nAt some point the Dark Goddess got the upper hand and doused many of Selûnes motes of light. In a desperate move, Selûne tore a piece of magical essence from herself and hurled it at her sister. When it hit, Shar also lost a portion of her essence and was cast into the void for centuries. From the blending of dark and light energies, Mystryl was born as a being of pure magic inextricably tied to the Weave. Both of the twins were diminished as a result, with the Moonmaidens wound being more grave. However, Mystryl was ideologically closer to Selûne, and being created from both light and darkness, Mystryl (and later goddesses of magic) acted as a balancing force between Selûne and the Lady of Loss.\nIn  (3520 in Netherese reckoning), the Netherese archwizard Karsus took it upon himself to defeat the phaerimm that were threatening the Netherese empire. He had spent years researching Karsuss avatar, the only 12th-level spell ever created, which was designed to temporarily rob a deity of their power and grant it instead to the spellcaster. Wearing the so-called Crown of Karsus, Karsus chose to rob Mystryl, and when her godly essence poured into him his mind and body were overwhelmed and he found that he was incapable of wielding such power. While Karsus briefly achieved apotheosis, his actions, which came to be known as Karsuss Folly, ended the empire of Netheril in mere moments. In the time it took for the Mother of All Magic to reincarnate herself, most of the floating cities of Netheril crashed to the ground. \nWhen the goddess of magic was reborn&mdashthis time as Mystra&mdashshe used as a vessel a beautiful peasant girl who was just learning cantrips but who had the capability of one day becoming an archwizard. She immediately took control of the Weave and magic returned to Toril. In the aftermath of the Fall of Netheril, the new goddess took a much more lawful view of magic use and laid down some rules, including a decree that the most powerful of spells would fail utterly.\n*It was believed that the newly reincarnated goddess either destroyed Karsuss notes on his ultimate spell, or sent them flying off to the far corners of the multiverse.\n*Ancient Mystrylan tomes spoke of three time gates&mdashpermanent edifices that were imbued with the time conduit spell. One was believed to be buried in a cave in the Spine of the World another was atop Miskens Peak north of Novularond, which was sheared off by the Great Glacier ages ago the last was on Andrus Peak near the city of Cedarsproke in the Vilhon Reach, which has seen many volcanic eruptions over the centuries.\n*There is a legend that states when Mystryl sacrificed herself to defeat Karsus, she gave up her divinity and didnt actually die. She instead became a will o wisp queen of great and unusual power, retaining her sentience and alignment, and exists in this form to this very day. In this form she often \"lures\" or guides mortals she favors by appearing to them as a moving beacon when they are lost or wandering, leading them to refuge, to lost magic, or a desired location or entity. This belief is supported by the dream-visits most recently received by the surviving Mystryl worshipers, in which communication from what they believe is their goddess comes from the form of a will o wisp.Ed Greenwood (2022-02-05) [https//x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1490044311899193346 Mystra Incapacitated] (Tweet).
