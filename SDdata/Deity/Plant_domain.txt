The Plant domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with plant-related spells and powers.
They gained the ability to rebuke or command plant creatures, and they could study knowledge of nature.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the entangle, barkskin, and plant growth spells. Clerics of some experience could cast control plants, wall of thorns, and repel wood. Those that were masters of this domain had access to changestaff, command plants, and shambler.
