        "mainbody": "Bright Nydra () was a demigod and later an aspect of Selûne.\nNydra had two avatars, one was a pale-skinned human woman, wrapped from head to toe in a toga of her own silver hair. Said skin was tinged with blue highlights. Her eyes were noted to have a strange focus about them, as if concentrating on things that were no longer apparent. She is also noted as having a fey-like beauty.\nHer other avatar was that of a shaft of bright moonlight run through with silver faerie fire.\nBright Nydra was noted as being a caring deity, but her emotions changed with the phases of the moon. When she was upset, she would put on a cheery and hopeful facade.\nNydra had no divine realm, as she dwelled bodily upon Toril.\nNydra appeared to those who were depressed and/or lost. She would attempt to cheer them up and lead the lost home. When mortals had earned her favor, she placed tear-shaped diamonds for them to find.\nBright Nydra was allied with Chauntea, Eldath, Lathander, and Mielikki - all of whom are part of the pantheon of deities led by Nydra who were worshiped by the Marsh Drovers.\nShe counted Auril as an enemy.\nNydra was said to have been the daughter of Selûne and Shaundakul, who fell to Faerûn from the Tears of Selûne, supposedly in the 4th century Dalereckoning on a midwinter night. She appeared as a human woman to refugees fleeing a goblinoid horde in the High Moors north of the Storm Horns, leading them west into the Farsea Marshes where they would became the Marsh Drovers.\nAt some point after this, Selûne absorbed her divine essence, making Nydra an aspect of herself rather than a separate entity.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, after escaping his imprisonment in High Horn, Nydra is said to have defeated the avatar of Bhaal and driven him out of the Farsea Marshes while he was pursuing Midnight."
