        "mainbody": "ities could be divided into categories, either by rank, origin, or by living and dead.\n\n===Types by Rank===\n====14th Century DR====\nDeities were ranked in increasing divine power from the so-called quasi deity up to overdeity. The two factors to determine the strength of a deity were numbers and the devotion of its followers. So it was possible for deities with a small follower base to have a higher standing, when the said followers consisted of fanatics.\n:;Quasi-deity  (Rank 0)\n:A quasi-deity, or hero deity, was a creature with divine characteristics, such as immortality. Children of real deities were generally quasi-deities. Unlike normal quasi-deities, who couldn't grant spells to their worshipers, these dragons could do so after the worshiper in question formally swore loyalty to the dragon.\n:;Demigod  (Rank 1-5)\n:A demigod was, contrary to its name, not a half-god but a full deity, though the weakest of these and only capable of the most basic abilities of a god, which were still of superhuman nature. They generally represented one aspect of mortal life and had hundreds, or even thousands, of followers and were capable of granting spells.\n:;Lesser deity  (Rank 6-10)\n:A lesser deity was more powerful than demigods and had more abilities. They generally had thousands, if not tens of thousands, of followers.\n:;Intermediate deity  (Rank 11-15)\n:An intermediate deity was more powerful than lesser ones and had more abilities. They generally had over 100,000 followers.\n:;Greater deity  (Rank 16-20)\n:A greater deity was more powerful than intermediate ones and had more abilities. They generally had millions of followers.\n:;Overdeity (Rank 21+)\n:An overdeity was, as the name suggests, over everything, including mortals' abilities to understand them. They didn't react in any way to anything a mortal could do, and they didn't grant spells. They generally had no followers, if mortals knew of their existence at all. Ao fit such a description.\n\n====15th Century DR====\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]], the deities of the [[Realms]] withdrew most of their direct influence, the divine ranks were redefined, and the number of divine ranks decreased.\n\n:;Quasi-deity\n:A powerful being of divine origin that had potential to acquire true godhood. Types of quasi-deities were [[demigod]]s, [[titan]]s, and [[vestige]]s.\n\n:;Lesser deity\n:A deity that was embodied in the [[planes]], from the [[Material Plane]] to the [[Abyss]], etc. Examples of lesser deities as of the 15{{th}} century DR were [[Lurue]], [[Sekolah]], [[Lolth]], and [[Auril]].\n\n:;Greater deity\n:A deity that was beyond the understanding of mortals, almost always did not directly interfere in mortal affairs, and could not be summoned.\n\n===Types by Origin===\n====Native Deities====\nThe native deities of [[Faerûn]] were those whose worship arose during the creation of [[Abeir-Toril]], or shortly after, and who were only worshiped there. In general, the native deities were worshiped by the native races of Abeir-Toril, those that arose from the primordial chaos at Ao's creation of [[Realmspace]]. [[Human]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[lizardfolk]], [[naga]]s, [[yuan-ti]], [[locathah]], [[doppelganger]]s, and the [[fey]] races were the most common worshipers of native deities.\n\n====Interloper Deities====\nHumans, [[elves]], and other creatures had made their way onto the face of [[Abeir-Toril]] over the millennia. Many of them brought their own divine patrons with them. Those gods who served portfolios where no native Faerûnian power exists seemed to almost automatically achieve divine status. Those whose portfolios conflicted with an existing deity were either absorbed into the existing deity, or may have contested for the power of their worshipers. In the last case, it would be a \"winner take all\" type of event, or the loser would have to accept a smaller portfolio and a subservient position within the pantheon.\n\nThe gods of the [[dwarves]], elves, [[illithid]]s, [[halfling]]s, and [[gnome]]s followed their respective peoples into Abeir-Toril. Later, the gods of the [[orc]]s and other [[goblinoid]] races did the same, following and supporting their worshipers.\n\n===Types by Living Status===\nDeities could be categorized by their living status: alive or dead. This category held because a dead deity wasn't necessarily unable to influence the world.\n\n===Dead Deities===\n{{quote|''I shall never know my maker for they are so long dead there are none that know where they have gone. What is a god when there is no one to think of them?'''|[[Metastakixx]]}}\nDeities, while immortal, were capable of dying. Conflict with other deities, conflict with great mortal heroes, and neglect were the most common causes of a divine demise, though it was also possible for a god to lapse into apathy, drift into sleep on the [[astral plane]], and eventually perish. [[Ulutiu]] was a prime example of this last possibility.<ref>\n\nThough a deity could die, at least a part of them would always remain.

Some, however, remained distinct, such as the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] Additionally, the [[Maztican pantheon]], the [[Zakharan pantheon]], and the [[Celestial Empire]] of [[Kara-Tur]], all remained distinct by virtue of geographic separation. Vanished human pantheons included the [[Talfiric pantheon]], the [[Netherese pantheon]], which was worshiped by the middle and lower classes of Netheril; the [[Jhaamdathan pantheon]], from what would later be called the [[Vilhon Reach]] and the [[Dragon Coast]]; the [[Coramshite pantheon]], based in ancient Coramsham (which became [[Calimshan]]); and the [[Untheric pantheon]], which was of similar source as the Mulhorandi pantheon, but lost all but two of its members during the Time of Troubles.",

The dwarves worshiped the [[Morndinsamman]],> the gnomes favored the [[Lords of the Golden Hills]], and the halflings named their pantheon of deities [[Yondalla's Children]]. The orcs had their own unnamed [[Orc pantheon|pantheon]],{{Cite dragon/62/The Gods of the Orcs}} while the giants had the [[Giant pantheon|Ordning]]. The [[Draconic pantheon|pantheon of the dragons]] was among the most ancient pantheons. And finally, the good-aligned races of [[Serôs]] worshiped a loose pantheon called the [[Asathalfinare]], which was led by the elven god [[Deep Sashelas]].",
            "Other Monstrous Faiths": "Monsters tended not to want to worship the deities of the more civilized races. Many monsters had their own gods, whose portfolios consisted of dominion over the creatures that worship them, such as the [[kobold]] god, [[Kurtulmak]]. Some species however, had a whole pantheon of gods, such as the [[yuan-ti]] pantheon (that had actually been secretly subsumed by [[Set]]).",
            "Fiend Worship": "Some [[fiend]]s had gained enough mortal followers on Faerûn to achieve a divine portfolio. Most of these fiends were [[demon]]s from the [[abyss]], such as [[Yeenoghu]] (a demon prince) and [[Baphomet]] (one of the demon lords), while [[devil]]s, such as [[Gargauth]], had also managed to ascend. [[Asmodeus]] even ascended to join the Faerûnian pantheon when he stole the divinity of Azuth."
