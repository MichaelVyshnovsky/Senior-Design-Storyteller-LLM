        "mainbody": "'''Tefnut''' was the goddess of storms and [[water]] in the [[Pharaonic pantheon]].",
        "Description": "Tefnut's true form was that of a slender, attractive woman with the head of a [[lion]]ess. This was the only form her [[avatar]] was known to take. The air around her always smelled of rain and lightning.",
        "Personality": "As she embodied the moisture of the atmosphere in both its calm and wrathful forms, her mood and disposition was very mercurial. Sometimes she was fierce and full of hostility, while at other times she was gentle and loving. However, she was not cruel and would never destroy without cause. Changed in her mood could typically be sensed reading the weather.",
        "Abilities": "Tefnut possessed a wide array of magical abilities. This included being capable of calling upon wind storms, [[shapechange|shapechanging]] at will, [[speak with the dead|speaking with the dead]], ''[[teleport]]ing'', and [[conjure water elemental|conjuring water elementals]].\n\nHer avatar form had access to spells from the [[sphere]]s [[All sphere|all]], [[animal sphere|animal]], [[Astral sphere|astral]], [[Elemental sphere|elemental]], [[Summoning sphere|summoning]], [[Sun sphere|sun]], and [[Weather sphere|weather]].",
        "Combat": "Tefnut generally fought by striking her foes with ''[[lightning bolt]]''s. If this proved to be ineffective, she would teleport away from the scene of battle.",
        "Possessions": "Tefnut possessed an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[sword]] that she could command to transform into a stroke of lightning. She also had packs of lionesses that accompanied her wherever she went. They obeyed her every command and would defend her without hesitation.",
        "History": "Tefnut was created alongside her twin brother [[Shu (deity)|Shu]] by the deity [[Ra]] and went on to produce numerous offspring with him. The first of these were [[Geb]] (the earth) and [[Nut (deity)|Nut]] (the sky).\n\nWhen her group of deities were asked by [[Ao]] through the intervention of [[Ptah]] to assist their worshipers who had been abducted by the [[Imaskari]] to [[Toril]], Tefnut stayed behind together with Nut and Shu at the command of Ra.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|25}}",
        "Realm": "Tefnut resided within the [[plane]] of [[Bytopia]], in the layer of [[Shurrock]], in a [[divine realm|realm]] known as [[Windwrath]] that sat atop one of Bytopia's many mountains. It was constantly beset by rain and winds that only let up occasionally, which [[petitioner]]s hid from inside of cavern villages. The largest of these was known as [[Ston-khat]] and led by a [[proxy]] named [[Dyalotep the Lame]]. They spent their time serving Tefnut and aiding any passerby's.\n\nBesides that divine realm, she was believed to reside on the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].",
        "Relationships": "Tefnut's brother-husband was very protective of her and would bring vengeance upon any who dared to harm her. Oftentimes [[Horus-Re]] would help him in such endeavors.",
        "Worshipers": "The [[priest]]s of Tefnut were typically known to wear [[scale armor|scale]] [[helmet]]s{{Cite dragon/115/Hammer of Thor, Spear of Zeus|40}} Her priests could predict the weather with absolute accuracy, and had access to the [[spell]]s ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[control weather]]'', and ''[[weather summoning]]''. Her priests were expected to cherish storms, thus it was not uncommon to find them outside during fierce downpours. Their sacrifices to her took the form of animals.\n\nWhile Tefnut was never worshiped by the [[Mulan]] of Toril,"
