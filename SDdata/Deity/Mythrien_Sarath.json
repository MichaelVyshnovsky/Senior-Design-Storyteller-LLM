        "mainbody": "'''Mythrien Sarath''' was one of several [[elf|elven]] [[deity|gods]] of [[magic]] in danger of losing their deific status because of lack of worshipers. As [[Mystra]] once delegated certain aspects of magic to other, lesser deities, so too did [[Corellon Larethian]] before her. Mythrien held dominion over [[Abjuration|protective magic]] and aided [[high mage]]s in the erection of ''[[mythal]]s''.",
        "Relationships": "Mythrien held an enduring hatred towards Malar for his actions during the creation of ''Mythrien's Ring'' and a similar dislike of [[Talos]] and [[Mask]] as he suspected both of aiding Malar's theft of the relic. He also shared the [[Seldarine]]'s enmity towards [[Lolth]] and the [[orc pantheon]].\n\nMythrien answered to [[Sehanine Moonbow]] rather than Corellon within the [[Seldarine]] and could be counted as her ally. Similarly, Mythrien counted Mystra as an ally too.",
        "Worshipers": "Mythrien had no organized church, nor did he have a significant priestly following. He commanded his followers to find and slay followers of Malar, Talos and Mask, leading to [[divine champion]]s outnumbering his priests (known as Seekers) by a ratio of 7:3. On the anniversary of the loss of ''Mythrien's Ring'', his worshipers often started holy wars against the followers of their deity's enemies, as well as against thieves with poor reputations. They would also zealously follow any rumor of the whereabouts of ''Mythrien's Ring'', hoping to use it to free their god's avatar and restore him to his former glory.\n\nMythrien's worshipers celebrated a holy day on [[Ches 12]], \"The Forging and the Loss\", commemorating the anniversary of Malar's attack and theft.",
        "History": "It is unknown exactly how many ''mythals'' Mythrien played a part in creating, though it is known, according to lore kept safe on [[Evermeet]], that he did not help with the one around [[Myth Drannor]]. He poured some of his divine essence into every ''mythal'' that he helped create; unfortunately this had the effect of leading to a decline in his overall power.\n\nIn an attempt to restore himself to his previous power, he began work on creating the [[relic]] known as ''[[Mythrien's Ring]]''. In [[avatar]] form, Mythrien secreted himself in a hidden dungeon (said to be somewhere under what was later the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]]) and began the long, complex process of creating it. During a crucial part of the creation process however, [[Malar]] the Beastlord attacked Mythrien's avatar, causing the process to go awry and trapping the avatar in the dungeon.\n\nAs a result, Malar stole the [[artifact]] and Mythrien's avatar was unable to return to [[Arvandor]]. After that time, Mythrien never left Mythralan, his palace on Arvandor, and could only communicate with his worshipers through visions.\n\nUnable to help create new ''mythals'' or send avatars to [[Toril]], the number of Mythrien's worshipers dwindled to a level that, since the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], placed him in danger of losing his status as a god.\n\nMythrien was still a god of the Seldarine by the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]]."
