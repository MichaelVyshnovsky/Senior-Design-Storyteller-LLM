        "mainbody": "'''Freya''', or '''Freyal''', was an ''ajami'' deity, worshiped by the [[efreet]] of the [[City of Brass]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and a Vanir",
        "Description": "Freya was a goddess of sensual love, fiery passion, magic, human fertility, and she looked after women in labor. In her humanoid form, she appeared to be a beautiful, voluptuous [[elf|elven]] woman of {{SI|6'|'\"|long=yes}}.",
        "Personality": "[[File:Freya holy symbol.jpg|thumb|''A [[holy symbol]] of Freya.'']]\nAs a goddess of love, Freya was a patron of romantic arts, and poetry was the deity's favorite. She spilled tears of [[gold]] in sorrow and sadness every time her husband Odur left Freya on his many voyages.\n\nFreya never hesitated to use the magical waters of ''[[Evergold]]'' to maintain her beauty. Some considered that to be vain; however, Freya cared not for others' opinions and was free to choose her own path. The goddess's fierce intelligence complemented her passionate nature. All these qualities made Freya quite desirable by mortals and divine beings alike, gaining her numerous male allies among various pantheons and not just the Norse.",
        "Abilities": "Freya was a powerful spellcaster who often traveled in the form of a [[falcon]]. She was completely unaffected by flames, and avian creatures could not hurt Freya. She had the ability to control flames and stoke fires of passion in mortals anywhere in her domain. Freya could bless a woman with a child and heal any pain or injury. Any male who gazed on her form had to resist the goddess' magical ''[[charm]]'' or be under her sway.",
        "Possessions": "Freya owned the ''Necklace of the Brisings'', also called ''Brisingamen'', a masterfully crafted piece of precious jewelry made for her by the [[Ysgardian dwarves]]. The necklace glowed when a lie was uttered in its vicinity. The goddess rode a [[chariot]] pulled by two [[lion]]s into battle. She brandished an enchanted ''+3 [[frostbrand]]'' longsword. A majestic cloak of falcon feathers allowed Freya to shapeshift into her falcon form. In her avatar form, she could manifest a flaming ''+4'' dagger that could incinerate targets with a mere cut. The dagger's effect could not be removed unless a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell was used.\n\nAlong with other deities of love and beauty, [[Hanali Celanil]], Aphrodite, and [[Sune]], Freya had access to the divine charisma-enhancing pool of [[enchanted]] waters – ''[[Evergold]]''.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Freya's avatar wielded a powerful ''+5 dancing spell storing longsword''.",
        "Divine Realm": "Freya's realm – the grand hall of Sessrumnir in [[Vanaheim]], received half of the souls slain in battle, as well as all women who fell in combat. Along with her twin brother, Freya lived in the realm of [[Asgard]] to promote peace between Aesir and Vanir. Freya's own realm – Vanaheim, where Sessrumnir stood near the center of Folkvang has a home to most of the goddess petitioners and few [[einheriar]] warrior-spirits. Twice per year, fertility festivals consumed her hall, one celebrating the planting of crops and another – harvest. Sessrumnir was a spacious hall of glowing white [[beech]]wood with hanging rafters and a [[silver]] roof. The hall's pillars were [[tree]]s that grew up through Sessrumnir's ceiling. Half of the trees were living, signifying the fact that Freya spent only half of a year in Sessrumnir. The hall was filled with [[walnut]] tables. The hall of Sessrumnir was a gift from the Aesir and was completely impregnable unless the goddess herself opened the doors. Freya also shared in ''Evergold'', the Fountain of Youth, with other goddess of beauty like [[Hanali Celanil]] and [[Sune]].<ref>",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Dogma": "Freya's worshipers were organized into highly enthusiastic cults that operated in exuberance and revered passions. The faith welcomed diversity, both racial and cultural, and aimed to promote beauty in magic and find magic in beauty. Those who sought to join one of Freya's cults had to demonstrate passion and ardor for the elements of the goddess' portfolio, and their physical appearance or physical beauty mattered not.",
            "Festivals": "The inhabitants of Alfheim, who worshiped Freya and her twin brother, celebrated Freya's Fest, an autumn festival that celebrated the rebirth of land and fertility. The celebration consisted of a feast with wild revelries and dances that lasted through the night."
        },
        "Relationships": "Freya's twin brother was named Frey, and her father – Njord. According to some myths, she taught Aesir the Vanir witchcraft. Freya's husband was Odur."
