'''Gorthok the Thunder Boar''' was a [[primal spirit]] in service of the god [[Talos]]. It preferred to take the form of a massive [[giant boar]].

==Description==
Gorthok often appeared as a [[boar]] the size of an [[elephant]] with crackling electricity leaping between its tusks.
==Personality==
Gorthok was fearless and vicious. Although it honored the commands of any Talos faithful who summoned it, Gorthok cared about little other than destruction,
==Abilities==
In its boar form, Gorthok was a tough and relentless beast whose tusks were charged with lightning and whose hooves roared with thunder. It was very hearty, taking a great deal of effort to subdue. Compounding this, it was resistant to most physical blows and was entirely immune to the effects of lightning and thunder. It could also discharge ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' from its tusks. 

When summoned by followers of Talos, Gorthok would appear in their location suddenly and with a loud clap of thunder to herald its arrival.
==Relationships==
Gorthok was a faithful servant of [[Talos]], the god of storms. During stormy weather, Talos's faithful could summon Gorthok to do their bidding. The [[anchorites of Talos]] based in [[Neverwinter Wood]] revered Gorthok and made use of its might.
==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], three anchorites of Talos plotted to summon Gorthok at the [[Circle of Thunder]]
