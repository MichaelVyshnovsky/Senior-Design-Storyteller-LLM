        "mainbody": "Sune ( but also of deeper connections, of matches destined and forbidden, as well the transformation of ugliness into beauty.\nWhen Sune appeared to the mortals of Faerûn she did so as a human female of unearthly beauty dressed in only a near-transparent gown of silk. She was known for her lustrous, impossibly long red hair, the color of which persisted regardless of any other permutations in her appearance, and which often assumed the appearance of flames. Aside from this, her physical manifestation would change from time to time. Her skin might be golden, mahogany, reddish, or ivory, and her eyes might be sky-blue, forest green, almond-shaped, or of darkest amber or honey, while also possessing ruby red plump lips.\nSune was a benevolent goddess that abhorred the destruction of beauty. She thrived on the tenderest of emotions and truly loved and protected her followers, reserving her deepest love for the mortals who revered her. She was also one of the most vain entities in the cosmos, enjoying attention and sincere flattery while avoiding the horrific and boorish.\nThe sometimes whimsical Princess of Passion alternated between deep passion and casual flirtation with others. When she was truly interested in a person or god, she wholeheartedly believed in these deep-seated feelings, but although she was one of the most passionate beings in existence, her focus lasted only a short time (as long as the subject continued to be enticing) before she lost interest and moved on.\nTo look upon Sunes avatar could very well end a battle before it began. Her looks, if unclothed, could kill if she so desired, a powerful form of death magic difficult to resist. Even when garbed however, she could enrapture anyone she wanted within . Such was her appearance that it was almost impossible to tear ones eyes away after so much as a glance, and none but immortals could resist at least getting a good look. Animals would never attempt to harm her, and upon seeing her no male being of any kind would either, the latter to the point that even thinking to do so was simply impossible.\nSune could cast spells from all arcane schools and divine spheres, but her charm magic (including spells of the charm sphere and school of enchantment which affected emotions, beguiled, enthralled, commanded, persuaded, or otherwise worked similarly to charm person spells) were four times as potent and much harder to resist.\nThe silken sash Sune wore acted as a +5 whip, enchanted with chaotic, defending, keen, and shock properties.\nSune shared a realm with various other goddesses, originally with just Tymora and Lliira, but later expanding the group to include Sharess and Waukeen. That realm was Brightwater, located in the outer plane of Arborea in the Great Wheel cosmology and a plane of its own in the World Axis cosmology. Brightwater was a well-settled realm devoted to beauty, among other things, all of which shined from every face and building constant entertaining activities went on in Brightwater, and it was no less glamorous than Arvandor for its civilization.\nBrightwater was structured like a Material Plane city into wards or sectors, each a divine realm, with Waukeens in the middle and the others arranged around it, and Sunes realm was known as the Heartfire Quarter. Smaller, quieter, and much more private than most of Brightwaters other locales, the Heartfire Quarter consisted of small rooms and hidden courtyards, the night air filled with the aromas of incense and candle-light. The outer reaches were lined with festhalls, matchmaker shops and inns for young couples, and every street was marked with a monument to loves triumphs.\nThough devoted to the ideals of love, it was not without its dangers. Most paths were unexplored and crimes of passion were common, as were rumors (never proven) of succubi and incubi infiltrators. The only ones willing to dare the inner precincts were the stout of heart and petitioners seeking to merge with the goddess, the winding streets near the center said to destroy some forever and merge others into the realm.\nThe Heartfire Quarter stood juxtaposed to Lliiras Quarter of Orange Lanterns, both geographically (being separated by Sharesss realm of Rapture) and philosophically. It was deeper than Lliiras domain of constant celebrations, a realm of beauty inhabited by those wanting more than just a party. It was a place of quiet mysteries whose contemplative denizens, drawn in by Sunes secretive smile, sought something beyond material gratification and even love. It was unclear what awaited those drawn to the center of the realm, often the adventuring sort who came after the delights of the other realms dimmed, but it was known what they sought serenity, bliss, perfection and true passion.\nDuring the Spellplague, Sune moved Brightwater to Selunes realm, the Gates of the Moon. Most of the other goddesses joined her in her romantic city, though Tymora had her own area within the Gates known as the Great Wheel and Waukeens Marketplace Eternal moved to Amaunators realm.\nSune had been romantically linked with many members of the Faerunian pantheon in the many myths of the realms for example she was said to have been smitten with Torm for his actions during the Time of Troubles, and many deities, including Torm himself as well as Amaunator, had become smitten with her in turn. In regards to such matters, the Lady of Love was simultaneously distant and flirtatious.\nSune was served by both Lliira and Sharess and was allies with Milil, Lathander, and Selune, the latter of which was also a servant of Lady Firehair in the past before going her own way, She also gave her aid to Mystra in her struggle against Shar and the Shadow Weave, for she had earned the service of Sharess when she saved the demipower from being subsumed by Shar, and as such was considered an enemy by the Nightbringer. \nBy her nature, it was difficult for any being to be angry at Sune for long, and so the goddess had no true enemies. She also had no love for Talona, goddess of disease, or Tempus, god of battle, on similar grounds, although the latter considered her too flighty and irrelevant to be worth the conflict or even dislike. \nOutside of the Realms, Sune was considered a \"backwater power with delusions of grandeur\" by her deific peers, such as Freya, Aphrodite and Hanali Celanil, but otherwise they got on well together - Sune of course, believing that she was the most beautiful of all of them.\nthumb|left|250px|The holy symbol of Sune.\nSunes clerics sought to bring beauty to the world in many forms, all of which were pleasing to the senses. They created great works of art, became patrons for promising actors, and imported exotic luxuries like satin and fine wines. Her followers also enjoyed looking beautiful, and hearing tales of romance. The stories ranged from star-crossed love, true love overcoming all else, to following ones heart. The negative aspects of love, as would be expected, were downplayed and kept from public view in the interest of making the faith welcoming for all.\nHer temples usually held social salons and displayed mirrors for use by lay parishioners. Some of them even had public baths for the local populace. Her shrines often stood on the corner of busy city streets. They would have a small ornate overhanging roof with a mirror underneath. They were used to check ones appearance while honoring Sune with prayer. Some shrines even held perfume and cosmetic items for those who could not afford such luxuries themselves.\n* Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose A knightly order affiliated with the Church of Sune, made up of bards, fighters, and paladins. Their primary mission was to guard Sunite temples and holy sites, and occasionally accompany clerics doing good works or questing for something important to the Lady of Love. Initiation into the order was done by standing vigil in a temple of Sune for an entire night. If the goddess showed her favor by granting a vision or some other boon, the candidate was accepted into the order.\n* Adon of Sune\n* Histra of the Edificant Library\n* Taegan Nightwind\n* Joelle Emmeline\nthumb|250px|The holy symbol of Sune.\nSunes history was mostly told in myth regarding her various romances and flirtations with other gods. Tales existed of her relationships with practically every god except Talos, Umberlee, Malar, Auril, Tempus, and Talona, whom Sune abhorred for their acts of destruction.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, Sune rescued Sharess from death at the hands of Shar and restored the corrupted deity to her original state before Shars influence affected her.\nDuring the Spellplague, Sunes plane of Brightwater was destroyed, but Selûne invited Sune and her exarchs to join her in the Gates of the Moon. During this period of transition, it was revealed that many lesser powers of love in the Realms, most notably Hanali Celanil, were all aspects of Sune. Sune, along with Tyr and Lathander was one of the triumvirate of deities who declared that Cyric should be imprisoned for the apparent death of Mystra.\nSome speculated that Sune was in fact the same or similar as the goddess Athena of the Olympian pantheon.Although the text says \"Athena\", it is more likely Venus or Aphrodite, as she is a goddess of love and beauty commonly depicted with red hair, while Athena is not. Furthermore, \"Sune\" is the final four letters of \"Venus\" reversed."
