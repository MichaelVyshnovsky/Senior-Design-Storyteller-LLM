        "mainbody": "but also of deeper connections, of matches destined and forbidden, as well the transformation of ugliness into beauty.\n\n{{quote|Beauty is more than skin deep; it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's fair (or foul) face to the world.|A Sunite saying.}}",
        "Description": "When Sune appeared to the mortals of [[Faerûn]] she did so as a human female of unearthly beauty dressed in only a near-transparent [[gown]] of [[silk]]. She was known for her lustrous, impossibly long red hair, the color of which persisted regardless of any other permutations in her appearance, and which often assumed the appearance of flames. Aside from this, her physical manifestation would change from time to time. Her skin might be golden, mahogany, reddish, or ivory, and her eyes might be sky-blue, forest green, almond-shaped, or of darkest amber or honey, while also possessing [[ruby]] red plump lips.",
        "Personality": "Sune was a benevolent goddess that abhorred the destruction of beauty. She thrived on the tenderest of emotions and truly loved and protected her followers, reserving her deepest love for the mortals who revered her. She was also one of the most vain entities in the cosmos, enjoying attention and sincere flattery while avoiding the horrific and boorish.\n\nThe sometimes whimsical Princess of Passion alternated between deep passion and casual flirtation with others. When she was truly interested in a person or god, she wholeheartedly believed in these deep-seated feelings, but although she was one of the most passionate beings in existence, her focus lasted only a short time (as long as the subject continued to be enticing) before she lost interest and moved on.",
        "Powers": "To look upon Sune's avatar could very well end a battle before it began. Her looks, if unclothed, could kill if she so desired, a powerful form of [[death magic]] difficult to resist. Even when garbed however, she could ''[[Rapture|enrapture]]'' anyone she wanted within {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. Such was her appearance that it was almost impossible to tear one's eyes away after so much as a glance, and none but immortals could resist at least getting a good look. Animals would never attempt to harm her, and upon seeing her no male being of any kind would either, the latter to the point that even thinking to do so was simply impossible.\n\nSune could cast [[spell]]s from all [[arcane]] [[Magic#School|school]]s and divine [[sphere]]s, but her charm [[magic]] (including spells of the [[charm sphere]] and school of [[enchantment]] which affected emotions, beguiled, enthralled, [[command]]ed, persuaded, or otherwise worked similarly to ''[[charm person]]'' spells) were four times as potent and much harder to resist.",
        "Possessions": "The [[silk]]en [[sash]] Sune wore acted as a ''+5'' [[whip]], enchanted with ''[[chaotic]]'', ''[[defending]]'', ''[[keen]]'', and ''[[shock]]'' properties.",
        "Realm": "Sune shared a realm with various other goddesses, originally with just [[Tymora]] and [[Lliira]], but later expanding the group to include [[Sharess]] and [[Waukeen]]. That realm was [[Brightwater]], located in the [[outer plane]] of [[Arborea]] in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] and a plane of its own in the [[World Axis cosmology]]. Brightwater was a well-settled realm devoted to beauty, among other things, all of which shined from every face and building; constant entertaining activities went on in Brightwater, and it was no less glamorous than [[Arvandor]] for its civilization.\n\nBrightwater was structured like a [[Material Plane]] city into wards or sectors, each a divine realm, with Waukeen's in the middle and the others arranged around it, and Sune's realm was known as the Heartfire Quarter. Smaller, quieter, and much more private than most of Brightwater's other locales, the Heartfire Quarter consisted of small rooms and hidden courtyards, the night air filled with the aromas of incense and candle-light. The outer reaches were lined with festhalls, matchmaker shops and inns for young couples, and every street was marked with a monument to love's triumphs.\n\nThough devoted to the ideals of love, it was not without its dangers. Most paths were unexplored and crimes of passion were common, as were rumors (never proven) of [[succubi]] and [[incubi]] infiltrators. The only ones willing to dare the inner precincts were the stout of heart and [[petitioner]]s seeking to merge with the goddess, the winding streets near the center said to destroy some forever and merge others into the realm.\n\nThe Heartfire Quarter stood juxtaposed to Lliira's Quarter of Orange Lanterns, both geographically (being separated by Sharess's realm of [[Rapture]]) and philosophically. It was deeper than Lliira's domain of constant celebrations, a realm of beauty inhabited by those wanting more than just a party. It was a place of quiet mysteries whose contemplative denizens, drawn in by Sune's secretive smile, sought something beyond material gratification and even love. It was unclear what awaited those drawn to the center of the realm, often the adventuring sort who came after the delights of the other realms dimmed, but it was known what they sought: serenity, bliss, perfection and true passion.\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]], Sune moved Brightwater to [[Selune]]'s realm, the [[Gates of the Moon]]. Most of the other goddesses joined her in her romantic city, though Tymora had her own area within the Gates known as the [[Tymora#Divine_Realm|Great Wheel]] and Waukeen's [[Marketplace Eternal]] moved to [[Amaunator]]'s realm.",
        "Relationships": "Sune had been romantically linked with many members of the Faerunian pantheon in the many myths of the realms; for example she was said to have been smitten with [[Torm]] for his actions during the [[Time of Troubles]], and many deities, including Torm himself as well as Amaunator, had become smitten with her in turn. In regards to such matters, the Lady of Love was simultaneously distant and flirtatious.\n\nSune was served by both Lliira and Sharess and was allies with [[Milil]], [[Lathander]], and Selune, the latter of which was also a servant of Lady Firehair in the past before going her own way, She also gave her aid to [[Mystra]] in her struggle against [[Shar]] and the [[Shadow Weave]], for she had earned the service of Sharess when she saved the [[demipower]] from being subsumed by Shar, and as such was considered an enemy by the Nightbringer. \n\nBy her nature, it was difficult for any being to be angry at Sune for long, and so the goddess had no true enemies. She also had no love for [[Talona]], goddess of disease, or [[Tempus]], god of battle, on similar grounds, although the latter considered her too flighty and irrelevant to be worth the conflict or even dislike. \n\nOutside of the Realms, Sune was considered a \"backwater power with delusions of grandeur\" by her deific peers, such as [[Freya]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hanali Celanil]], but otherwise they got on well together - Sune of course, believing that she was the most beautiful of all of them.",
        "Worshipers": {
            "Orders": "* [[Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose]]: A knightly order affiliated with the [[Church of Sune]], made up of [[bards]], [[fighters]], and [[paladins]]. Their primary mission was to guard Sunite temples and holy sites, and occasionally accompany clerics doing good works or questing for something important to the Lady of Love. Initiation into the order was done by standing vigil in a temple of Sune for an entire night. If the goddess showed her favor by granting a vision or some other boon, the candidate was accepted into the order.",
            "Notable Sunites": "* [[Adon|Adon of Sune]]\n* [[Histra|Histra of the Edificant Library]]\n* [[Taegan Nightwind]]\n* [[Joelle Emmeline]]"
        },
        "History": "[[File:Sune Symbol-5e.png|thumb|250px|''The [[holy symbol]] of Sune.'']]\nSune's history was mostly told in myth regarding her various romances and flirtations with other gods. Tales existed of her relationships with practically every god except [[Talos]], [[Umberlee]], [[Malar]], [[Auril]], [[Tempus]], and [[Talona]], whom Sune abhorred for their acts of destruction.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], Sune rescued [[Sharess]] from death at the hands of [[Shar]] and restored the corrupted deity to her original state before Shar's influence affected her.<ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]], Sune's plane of Brightwater was destroyed, but [[Selûne]] invited Sune and her exarchs to join her in the [[Gates of the Moon]]. During this period of transition, it was revealed that many lesser powers of love in the Realms, most notably [[Hanali Celanil]], were all aspects of Sune. Sune, along with [[Tyr]] and [[Lathander]] was one of the triumvirate of deities who declared that [[Cyric]] should be imprisoned for the apparent death of Mystra.<ref>",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some speculated that Sune was in fact the same or similar as the goddess Athena of the [[Olympian pantheon]].<ref group=\"note\">Although the text says \"Athena\", it is more likely Venus or Aphrodite, as she is a goddess of love and beauty commonly depicted with red hair, while Athena is not. Furthermore, \"Sune\" is the final four letters of \"Venus\" reversed."
