Bala was a goddess of music in Zakhara and emphasized the importance of music to lift the spirit and mitigate suffering. She was a local goddess who was worshiped in the city of Mahabba, but her faith was outlawed and driven underground by the Pantheists. In this persecution her followers spread to other cities. Their sometimes violent resistance against their oppressors brought the goddess the epithet "of Ill Tidings".
Balas symbol was a zither.
The goddess has been described as a colorfully but modestly dressed, middle-aged woman who played her zither in a way that enchanted gods and genies.
Holy slayers of the Final Chord followed Balas teachings.
