'''Bala''' was a goddess of music in [[Zakhara]] and emphasized the importance of music to lift the spirit and mitigate suffering. She was a [[Zakharan pantheon|local goddess]] who was worshiped in the city of [[Mahabba]], but her faith was outlawed and driven underground by the [[Pantheist League|Pantheists]]. In this persecution her followers spread to other cities. Their sometimes violent resistance against their oppressors brought the goddess the epithet "of Ill Tidings".<br/>

Bala's symbol was a [[zither]].<br/>

The goddess has been described as a colorfully but modestly dressed, middle-aged woman who played her zither in a way that enchanted gods and [[genie]]s.

[[Holy slayer]]s of the [[Final Chord]] followed Bala's teachings.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|25-26}}
