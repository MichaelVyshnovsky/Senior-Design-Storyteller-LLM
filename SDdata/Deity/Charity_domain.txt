The Charity domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with charity-related spells and powers.
They could temporarily bequeath a portion of their health to an ally.
Novice spellcasters were able to use the goodberry, aid, and create food and water spells. Clerics of some experience could cast imbue with spell ability, mass cure light wounds, and heroes feast. Those that were masters of this domain had access to refuge, Mordenkainens magnificent mansion, and mass heal.
