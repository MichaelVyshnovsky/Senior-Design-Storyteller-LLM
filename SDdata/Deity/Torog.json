        "mainbody": "'''Torog''', also called the '''King that Crawls''', was an interloper [[god]] of [[Death domain|death]], the [[Underdark]], imprisonment, and torture from the world of [[Nerath]]. Unlike other gods, Torog was imprisoned within the [[Underdark]].\n{{Quote|''Little seen though he be, beneath Faerûn, ye would be wise to assume the maimed and suffering King That Crawls, crawls still.''|[[Elminster]]}}",
        "Abilities": "On Nerath, Torog held dominion over the [[domain]]s of [[Earth domain|earth]] and [[Torment domain|torment]].",
        "Divine Realm": "According to the [[World Axis cosmology|World Axis model]], Torog resided in the [[Prime Material plane]], as he was imprisoned in the Underdark.",
        "Worshipers": "Torog was one of the deities of the [[Dawn War pantheon|Dawn War]],<ref> He was worshiped by jailers and torturers, as well as many Underdark creatures.",
        "Activities": "Torog asked his worshipers to enjoy all kinds of pain, and to seek out and revere all the sacred places below the earth. He also opposed all kind of freedoms.",
        "History": "A short time before the [[Dawn War]], Torog faced a terrible [[primordial]] of the Underdark on his own. While Torog was victorious and was able to kill it, the primordial managed to curse him, bounding him to the Underdark and making him unable to heal from his wounds. Maimed and disfigured, Torog crawled across the Underdark searching for a way to the surface, breaking the dimensional boundaries that keep the Underdark separated from the [[Feywild]] and the [[Shadowfell]] in the process. Torog eventually managed to reach the surface world, but discovered that his powers were now tied to the Underdark and if he ever left it he will become powerless. Torog remained trapped in the Underdark ever since. Some people believed the [[World Serpent]] played a role in Torog's imprisonment.<ref>\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], many surface folk incorrectly believed that Torog had faded away into myth, however, some people, like [[Elminster]], reported that Torog was lurking in the [[Lowerdark]] below [[Faerûn]].{{cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200310050115/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1237238869336240128 |title= Ed's Twitter |date=2020-03-10 |accessdate=2023-12-26}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some people believed that if someone spoke the name of Torog, the god would burrow from below and drag the speaker underground, where they would be imprisoned and tortured forever."
