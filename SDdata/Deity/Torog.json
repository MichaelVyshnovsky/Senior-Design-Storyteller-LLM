        "mainbody": "Torog, also called the King that Crawls, was an interloper god of death, the Underdark, imprisonment, and torture from the world of Nerath. Unlike other gods, Torog was imprisoned within the Underdark.\nOn Nerath, Torog held dominion over the domains of earth and torment.\nAccording to the World Axis model, Torog resided in the Prime Material plane, as he was imprisoned in the Underdark.\nTorog was one of the deities of the Dawn War, He was worshiped by jailers and torturers, as well as many Underdark creatures.\nTorog asked his worshipers to enjoy all kinds of pain, and to seek out and revere all the sacred places below the earth. He also opposed all kind of freedoms.\nA short time before the Dawn War, Torog faced a terrible primordial of the Underdark on his own. While Torog was victorious and was able to kill it, the primordial managed to curse him, bounding him to the Underdark and making him unable to heal from his wounds. Maimed and disfigured, Torog crawled across the Underdark searching for a way to the surface, breaking the dimensional boundaries that keep the Underdark separated from the Feywild and the Shadowfell in the process. Torog eventually managed to reach the surface world, but discovered that his powers were now tied to the Underdark and if he ever left it he will become powerless. Torog remained trapped in the Underdark ever since. Some people believed the World Serpent played a role in Torogs imprisonment.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, many surface folk incorrectly believed that Torog had faded away into myth, however, some people, like Elminster, reported that Torog was lurking in the Lowerdark below Faer√ªn.\nSome people believed that if someone spoke the name of Torog, the god would burrow from below and drag the speaker underground, where they would be imprisoned and tortured forever."
