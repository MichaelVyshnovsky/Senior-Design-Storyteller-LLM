==Description==
Bhaal had three [[avatar]] forms: the ''Slayer'', the ''Ravager'', and  [[Kazgoroth]]. The Slayer resembled a male, [[humanoid]] corpse with a feral face and ivory skin inset with deep lacerations that flowed with black ichor; he preferred to assume it when in urban areas. The Ravager meanwhile was a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} monster with a twisted, grimacing face that featured a flowing beard and mane, {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} horns and eyes full of the flames of [[Gehenna]]; he assumed that form when visiting the rural regions of Toril. Kazgoroth form was simply a shape-shifting monstrosity.

In some extreme cases, Bhaal's mortal Bhaalspawn children could actually turn into creatures said to be one of the listed avatars after Bhaal himself died, but these incarnations were even more monstrous and inhuman in shape, acting as little more than powerful killing machines. While powerful, they were weaker than a true god's avatars.

==Personality==
Bhaal only lived to hunt and kill, the presence of the living instilling in him an overpowering desire for death and destruction. He was at all times a cruel, violent and hateful being, though his behavior could vary from cold and calculating ruthlessness to a savage thirst for blood.

==Divine Realm==
[[File:Symbol-of-Bhaal.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
In the centuries before the [[Time of Troubles]], Bhaal’s divine realm was the ''[[Throne of Blood]]'' on [[Khalas]], the first layer of the [[outer plane]] of [[Gehenna]].

==Relationships==
A wholly evil, debased and sadistic god, Bhaal was reviled by a majority of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|pantheon]]; his [[divine]] foes included [[Chauntea]], [[Helm]], [[Ilmater]], [[Lathander]], [[Lliira]] and [[Tyr]]. Bhaal was served by the goddesses [[Talona]] and [[Loviatar]],

During his godhood he was served by the [[imp]] "butler" [[Cespenar]].

Bhaal had several [[Bhaalspawn|spawn]], with [[the Dark Urge]] and [[Sarevok]] being two such individuals. Sarevok has his own legacy, in [[Orin the Red]] and [[Helena Anchev]].

==Worshipers==
{{Main|Church of Bhaal}}
[[File:Reaperofbhaal.jpeg|thumb|238x238px|''A worshiper of Bhaal.'']]
The clergy of Bhaal in [[Faerûn]] were known as Bhaalists or Bhaalyn, the latter being used more commonly in the lands east of the [[Dragon Reach]]. Together they were a disorderly network of local hierarchies,

===Deathstalkers===
During the time that he was dead, Bhaal had many scattered cultist groups, the most infamous being the [[Deathstalker]]s of Bhaal, who attempted to bring him back to life. For a while after the [[Bhaalspawn]] crisis, it was believed his essence had been locked away on the [[Upper Planes]], preventing his resurrection permanently. However, this proved to be incorrect. Bhaal's essence had been preserved in his half-mortal children, the Bhaalspawn, and after the death of the last two Bhaalspawn, Bhaal was revived.

==History==
===Mortal===
[[File:Bhaalsymbol.png|thumb|220x220px|The violent symbol of Bhaal.]]
Before his ascension to godhood, Bhaal was a power-hungry adventurer on Toril. Along with his companions Bane and [[Myrkul Bey al-Kursi]], he sought to attain the portfolio of the God of the Dead [[Jergal]]. After defeating one of the [[Seven Lost Gods]], the three were able to travel to Jergal's domain, the [[Castle of Bone]] in the [[Gray Waste]]. Upon their arrival, Jergal willingly offered his realm to the [[Dark Three]], though they couldn't decide amongst themselves who would rule. 

Upon Jergal's suggestion, the three divided his power, deciding how to divide it based on the outcome of a game. The three played a game of [[knucklebones]], and Bane emerged as the victor. He claimed the domains of [[Hatred domain|hatred]], [[Strife domain|strife]] and [[Tyranny domain|tyranny]] as his own. Myrkul, coming second, chose rule over the dead, the ultimate fate for all of Bane's minions. Finally, Bhaal chose the [[divine]] province of [[Death domain|death]].

===Godhood===
Bhaal's reign of terror in the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the {{yearlinkName|1346}}, was a prime example of his cruelty and malice. Bhaal's shapeshifting avatar [[Kazgaroth]], which emerged from a [[Darkwell]], attempted to combine the [[firbolg]]s and [[Northmen]] into a conquering army set on destroying all the realms of the [[Ffolk]]. It even used its powers to corrupt some of the Northmen, turning them into [[blood warrior]]s who were bloodthirsty and extremely loyal to Kazgaroth.<ref> After Kazgaroth was slain by [[Tristan Kendrick]] and his allies, Bhaal sought to personally ravage and corrupt the Moonshae Isles. Through his cleric [[Hobarth]], he corrupted the Moonwell turning it into a Darkwell, formed an alliance with the [[Thayan]] wizard [[Cyndre]] in the court of High King [[Reginald Carrathal]], and raised an army of [[sahuagin]] and the [[undead]] through the sahuagin priestess [[Ysalla]].<ref> The Darkwell turned into a cancerous wound on the earth that corrupted and killed anyone who came near it. Bhaal used the Darkwell to summon forth 'The Children of Bhaal,' which included [[Thorax]] the [[owlbear]], a flock of [[peryton]]s, and a [[displacer beast]] known as [[Shantu]], which would lead them. All this was done to destroy the [[Earthmother]] and seize the Moonshae Isles as his personal domain. As the God of Murder sucked out the warm life of the Moonshaes through the Darkwell, the Earthmother's strength continued to fade until her spirit was completely extinguished, ending her reign on the isles.<ref> Bhaal's army of undead, sahuagin, firbolgs, [[ogre]] mercenaries, and the Children of Bhaal led by proxies such as Hobarth and Ysalla wreaked havoc across the isles by killing numerous people and razing settlements until they were defeated by the Ffolk united by the newly crowned King of the isles, Tristan Kendrick.<ref> Finally, the Darkwell was corrupted enough to open a portal to his own realm. Bhaal sent forth his avatar, the Ravager, fueled by much of his divine power, but it was slain by Tristan, High King of the Ffolk, using the ''[[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]]''. Defeated and greatly weakened, Bhaal was banished from the Moonshae Isles and even temporarily exiled from [[Toril]].

===Time of Troubles===
[[File:Cyric killing Bhaal.png|thumb|left|225px|''Bhaal about to be slain by Cyric.'']]
On [[Eleint 16]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, having lost his powers and being forced to walk [[Faerûn]] like the rest of the gods, Bhaal was slain by the upstart mortal [[Cyric]] using the avatar of [[Mask]], a sword named ''[[Godsbane]].'' In doing this, Cyric stole Bhaal's divinity and portfolio elements. However, much like Myrkul—who invested his divine essence in the [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Crown of Horns]]''—Bhaal was not utterly removed from Faerûn. Part of his divinity remained in the [[Winding Water]], around [[Boareskyr Bridge]] where he was slain, his blood having flowed into the river. More importantly, Bhaal foresaw his death and impregnated many mortal women, creating his heirs, the [[Bhaalspawn]]. The Bhaalspawn were involved in a series of conflicts along the [[Sword Coast]], with one standing above the others and ultimately foiling Bhaal's plan to return through his children.<ref name="BGII:ToB>

[[File:Bhaal_dying.png|thumb|right|225px|''The Lord of Murder, murdered.'']]
After the death of the Lord of Murder, the city-dwelling Bhaalists quickly converted to the worship of [[Cyric]], whom they referred to as ''Cyric-Bhaal''. The rural [[priest]]s maintained their faith for years to come, claiming they continued to receive their divine powers following their nightly prayers. The schism between Bhaal's remaining followers and the emerging Cyric-Bhaalists reached its apex in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, getting to the point where the factions would ambush and assault one another. Soon later, the remaining worshipers of Bhaal stopped receiving their divine powers and began gradually converting to [[Church of Cyric|Cyricism]] or [[Church of Iyachtu Xvim|Xvimism]].

===Reemergence===
For a time, it was believed that any possibility for Bhaal's resurrection had been stopped. The last known Bhaalspawn, [[Abdel Adrian]], resisted the murderous impulses caused by his lineage and became a famed and beloved figure in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, near the beginning of the era known as the [[Second Sundering]], [[Viekang]], another Bhaalspawn who was thought to be dead, attacked Adrian as he spoke to a crowd in the portion of town known as The Wide. While the ultimate winner of the duel is unknown, the victor transformed into a massive, blood-soaked creature and began a rampage that was only stopped when a group of adventurers new to Baldur's Gate defeated and killed the monstrosity.

With all of his children dead, all of Bhaal's essence was freed, allowing for his resurrection. Bhaal was revived, and reclaimed the murder domain from [[Cyric]]. However, the Lord of Murder was no longer a true deity, and was instead a being of [[quasi-deity|quasi-divine]] status. As with Bane and Myrkul, he was effectively a mortal.
