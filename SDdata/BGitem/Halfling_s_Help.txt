Halflings Help  was a wheat beer crafted by the halflings of Luiren.
Light-gold in color, Halflings Help had a slight taste of strawberries, with notes of sun-dappled meadows. It contained a high level of alcohol.
The beer was sold to inns and taverns in casks stamped with the name Beluir, and weighing 10 pounds.
A cask of Halflings Help cost 50 gp.
The Bhaalspawn known as Gorions Ward once purchased a cask from Vyatris Pub in Trademeet on behalf of the wild mage Mironda.
