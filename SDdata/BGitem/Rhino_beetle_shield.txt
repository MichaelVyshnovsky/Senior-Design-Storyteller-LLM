Rhino beetle shields were masterfully-crafted medium and tower shields that used giant rhinoceros beetles exoskeletons as their main material.
These shields used naturally tough and light-weight insect carapace. Duergar smiths developed a recipe to cure and reinforce this exotic material to be as tough as any metallic or wooden shield.
Rhino beetle shields that were shaped to resemble tower shield were imbued with simple +1 enchantments. Dwarven-crafted medium shields had +2 enchantment. They also provided additional protection from arrows, bolts, and other missiles weapons.
