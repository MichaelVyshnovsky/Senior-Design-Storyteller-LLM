        "mainbody": "A mail of the dead was a set of enchanted chainmail armor that earned its name by famously being worn by undead warriors.\nThis type of armor possessed a +2 enchantment.\nSome time during or before the 10 century DR, the mage Vorusta used mails of the dead to great effect. He would conjure forth skeleton warriors, armor them with the magical chainmail, and equip them with a great weapon before dispatching them as assassins. After they slew their targets, he gathered up the armor and arms to prepare for another killing.\nThe assassin Molkar of the Sword Coast wore a suit of this armor while he and his fellow killers went to kill Abdel Adrian."
