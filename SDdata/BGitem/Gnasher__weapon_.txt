'''''Gnasher''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[club]] created by the [[druid]] only known as [[Makal of the Pine]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Gnasher'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that increased the weapon's damage and improved the wielder's aim. Additionally, its sharp splinters caused the target to bleed after each successful bash embedded them into the target's flesh.

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the weapon was carved by Makal of the Pine, and enchanted via boding the spirit of Makal's fierce wolverine [[animal companion]] to the ''Gnasher''. This dangerous weapon remained in Makal's hands and served him on several occasions against [[orc]] loggers who threatened the druid's forest. Makal of the Pine was presumed dead by 1369 DR, when ''Gnasher'' was wielded by the [[Shadow Druid]] named [[Dalok]] who plagued the town of [[Trademeet]].
