'''''Dwarven throwers''''', not to be confused with ''dwarven throwers'' crafted by [[elves]], were [[enchanted]] [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[warhammer]]s that, once thrown, returned to the owner's hand.

{{quote|In my experience—for all their long-winded ramblings about lineage and tradition—dwarves are a greedy and devious people. I write this not to insult them in any way. I have found greed to be a useful motivator both for myself and my underlings, and I prize the ingenious trickery that some members of the race demonstrate. Such cleverness can be seen in the creation of ''mighty dwarven throwers''. You might see before you a dwarf holding a two-handed [[maul]] of so much heft it seems he could barely swing it, yet he hurls it fifty feet as easily as a child casts a stone. Then, in the blink of an eye, he holds it high once again.|[[Mordenkainen]]}}

==Description==
Even though they varied in design, the bold geometric shapes were the most commonly seen among dwarven-made arms. Some of these mighty weapons were able to produce hum or whine when in flight. This sound was referred to as "singing" by the stout smiths.

==Powers==
''Dwarven throwers''' enchantments made them only usable by dwarves. These hefty weapons possessed a ''+3'' enchantment but were also ensorcelled to be especially devastating to their much-hated [[giant]] opponents. ''Dwarven throwers'' could be turned as far as {{SI|280'|'"|long=yes}}.

When non-dwarves wielded these hammers, they appeared to function as simple ''+2'' enchanted weapons with no boomerang magic active.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1368 DR]], one such ''dwarven thrower'' could be purchased from a [[human]] merchant in the town of [[Trademeet]] in [[Amn]].

In [[1491 DR]], one of these magic hammers could be found in the abandoned mines of [[Tyar-Besil]].

==Notable Dwarven Throwers==
