The Pride of the Legion was a set of full plate armor that was worn by the soldiers of Unther.
This suit of +2 full plate mail offered significant protection against slashing and piercing weapons.
While they were commonly found among the soldiers of the ancient empire of Unther, they were rarely found during the 14 century DR. Those that were still in existence during that time were most often found among collectors and could fetch a small fortune if sold.
