        "mainbody": "The '''Flail of Ages''' was a powerful multi-headed [[flail]], each of whose heads did different kinds of damage. It also grew in power according to the number of heads currently on it.{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn}}{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal}}",
        "History": "It was originally created by a group of [[rakshasa]] for use in different sorts of battles. \n\nAround [[1368 DR]], it was in the possession of Lord [[de'Arnise]] (the father of [[Nalia de'Arnise]]). He was in possession of the handle and the fire, ice, and acid heads, which he kept hidden separately in his castle.\n\nIf [[Gorion's Ward]] embarked on the quest to free [[de'Arnise Hold]] from [[troll]]s, they would have the chance to assemble the flail at a magical forge also hidden in the castle; its acid and fire heads made it useful against trolls. The handle could then be combined with any number of heads in any combination. Each head added its own kind of damage and to the magical strength of the weapon, and once all were attached, the flail also gained a chance to slow opponents. \n\nLater, a further two heads for the flail could be found, and attached by [[Cespenar]], doing electrical and poison damage and further increasing the weapon's potency. With both attached, the flail gained the further ability to grant ''[[freedom of movement]]'' and a slight magic resistance, and the extra damage from each head was doubled in power."
