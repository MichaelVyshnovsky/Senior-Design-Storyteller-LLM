'''''Gloves pickpocketing''''' was a unique pair of [[enchanted]] [[thieves]]'s gloves that once belonged to the famous cutpurse named [[Fong Moo]] in the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Gloves pickpocketing'' dramatically enhanced the wearer's pick pocketing skills.

==History==
Several years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, these gloved were worn by an infamous [[Athkatla]]n and [[Baldurian]] cutpurse named Fong Moo. It remained unknown if the gloved were magical before the thief came to own them or if they were enchanted later by somehow becoming imbued with the master's essence. His illicit career ended when Fong was found dead along the road that led from Baldur's Gate to [[Beregost]]. The ''gloves pickpocketing'' were passed along to Fong Moo's nephew, who used them to become an accomplished thief in his own right. In 1369 DR, Fong's gloves belonged to a thief from Athkatla named [[Yarin]].
