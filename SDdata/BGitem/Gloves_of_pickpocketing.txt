Gloves pickpocketing was a unique pair of enchanted thievess gloves that once belonged to the famous cutpurse named Fong Moo in the mid 14 century DR.
Gloves pickpocketing dramatically enhanced the wearers pick pocketing skills.
Several years before the , these gloved were worn by an infamous Athkatlan and Baldurian cutpurse named Fong Moo. It remained unknown if the gloved were magical before the thief came to own them or if they were enchanted later by somehow becoming imbued with the masters essence. His illicit career ended when Fong was found dead along the road that led from Baldurs Gate to Beregost. The gloves pickpocketing were passed along to Fong Moos nephew, who used them to become an accomplished thief in his own right. In 1369 DR, Fongs gloves belonged to a thief from Athkatla named Yarin.
