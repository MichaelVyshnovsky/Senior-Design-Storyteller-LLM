The Shield of Balduran was the shield wielded by the legendary explorer Balduran.
This +3 shield made the wielder feel weak, but possessed the powerful ability to reflect the eye rays of beholders.
Along with his sword and armor, Baldurans shield was stolen from a museum in the city of Baldurs Gate. At some point it came into the inventory of Deidre, a merchant from Auroras Magic Emporium, who did business from the Adventurer Mart located in Amnian the city of Athkatla.
