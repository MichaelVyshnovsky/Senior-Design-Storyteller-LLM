        "mainbody": "A '''''wand of the heavens''''' was a magical [[wand]] that allowed its wielder to rain down fire as if from the [[Seven Heavens|heavens]] themselves and was usable only by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s.",
        "Powers": "When a charge of the wand was expended, a pillar of flame shot down from the skies, engulfing a given area as directed by the wand's wielder. Any person or creature struck in this manner had a chance to protect themselves from some of the harm caused by the flames.\n\nThe effects of the wand were similar to those produced by the spell ''[[flame strike]]'', though the spell varied in its intensity dependent on the skill and experience of the caster.\n\nA fully charged wand possessed 100 charges.",
        "History": "One of these wands was available for sale at [[Sorcerous Sundries]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some sages claimed that ''wands of the heavens'' were focus points and reservoirs of divine magic and that this power was pulled directly from cosmos and was thematic rather than dedicated to the will of any one deity, hence follower of any denomination was able to use these wands. However many thought that this description of the wands' power was as maddeningly confusing as the will of the gods themselves."
