        "mainbody": "A gorgon plate was a suit of enchanted full plate mail crafted by the drow of the Underdark under Old Shanatar. It was different from most armor crafted by the dark elves, in that it could withstand being exposed to light when it was brought upon the surface world of Toril.\nThis +4 set of full plate armor offered its wearer extra protection against acid and fire, both mundane or magical in nature.\nThis armor earned its name from a unique ingredient used in its crafting, the blood of a gorgon.\nMatron mother Ardulace Despana of Ust Natha was known to wear a suit of gorgon plate armor."
