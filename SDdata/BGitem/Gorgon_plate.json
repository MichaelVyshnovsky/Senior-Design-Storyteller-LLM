        "mainbody": "A '''''gorgon plate''''' was a suit of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[full plate|full plate mail]] crafted by the [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]] under [[Old Shanatar]]. It was different from most [[armor]] crafted by the dark elves, in that it could withstand being exposed to light when it was brought upon the surface world of [[Toril]].",
        "Powers": "This ''+4 set of full plate armor'' offered its wearer extra protection against acid and fire, both mundane or [[magic]]al in nature.",
        "Creation": "This armor earned its name from a unique ingredient used in its crafting, the blood of a [[gorgon]].",
        "Notable wearers": "[[Matron mother]] [[Ardulace Despana]] of [[Ust Natha]] was known to wear a suit of ''gorgon plate'' armor."
