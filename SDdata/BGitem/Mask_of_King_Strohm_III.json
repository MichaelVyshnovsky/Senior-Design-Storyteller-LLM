        "Powers": "When worn, an individual saw the world in different hues and colors. Through the mask they could see the otherwise hidden guardian within the [[Tomb of Strohm III|tomb of King Strohm III]].",
        "History": "After the mask was divided, its pieces were each placed into a chamber within the king's tomb in the [[Windspear Hills]]. Each piece was watched over by an individual guardian. \n\nTo enter into the final chambers of the tomb, each of the six pieces had to be assembled into the completed mask. When it was worn, an individual was granted sight to fully see a seventh guardian that protected the tomb."
