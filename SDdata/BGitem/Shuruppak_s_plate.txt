Shuruppaks plate was a unique set of plate mail armor that once belonged to Shuruppak, the former chosen of the dead god Gilgeam.
Despite its composition, the plate armor was surprisingly light.
Whomever wore Shuruppaks plate was granted supernatural speed and agility. They also gained partial protection against fire, whether magical or mundane in nature.
This armor was bestowed upon Shuruppak by Gilgeam himself, some time before the Time of Troubles, and was worn when the chosen slew many of the deitys enemies. The armor was lost under unknown circumstances and made its way into the possession of the fire giant Yaga-Shura.
