A wand of the heavens was a magical wand that allowed its wielder to rain down fire as if from the heavens themselves and was usable only by clerics and paladins.
When a charge of the wand was expended, a pillar of flame shot down from the skies, engulfing a given area as directed by the wands wielder. Any person or creature struck in this manner had a chance to protect themselves from some of the harm caused by the flames.
The effects of the wand were similar to those produced by the spell flame strike, though the spell varied in its intensity dependent on the skill and experience of the caster.
A fully charged wand possessed 100 charges.

However many thought that this description of the wands power was as maddeningly confusing as the will of the gods themselves.
