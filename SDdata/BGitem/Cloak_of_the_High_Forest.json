        "mainbody": "The Cloak of the High Forest was a type of magical cloak that was seemingly created by nature itself, within the High Forest of Northwest Faerûn. Once created, it would present itself to druids in times of reflection and need.\nThe uncovering of the cloak seemed to present a message to the wearer they could appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it\".\nThe cloak offered its wearer similar defenses to a cloak of protection.\nOne of these cloaks was discovered by the shapeshifting druid Cernd, when he spent a year traveling through Faerûn meditating upon his role in the grand balance of nature. Shortly before the cold season set in, Cernd found the cloak within the High Forest. His cloak appeared to have been woven from the undergrowth of the forest.\nYet another cloak of the High Forest was discovered by the future Great Druid Jasswin, when he spent a season never living under shelter in an attempt to \"feel the land unhindered\". Prior to the cold season of that particular year, the wind blew the cloak to him."
