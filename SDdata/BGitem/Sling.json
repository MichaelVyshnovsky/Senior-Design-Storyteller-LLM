        "mainbody": "Slings were a simple type of projectile weapon \nSlings consisted of a cord with a pouch to hold a projectile. These cords were typically made of either leather or some form of fabric.\nSlings were intended to be held with one or two hands and twirled in a circle. Once a high speed of twirling was released, the wielder would then launch their projectile at an opponent by releasing one of the slings straps ends.\nAgainst unarmored opponents a sling could produce severe bruising or even broken bones. However, they were not as powerful as bows, nor could they launch their projectiles as far as crossbows. Though compared to those weapons the sling was far cheaper and easier to make, costing effectively nothing if the proper materials could be found.\nthumb|273px|A sling lays on a table alongside a pouch full of bullets.\nSlings were typically loaded with either smooth rounded stones or a ball of lead, known as sling bullets.
