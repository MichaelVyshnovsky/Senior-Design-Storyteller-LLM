A '''''potion of speed''''', sometimes called a '''''potion of haste''''', was a very rare [[potion]] that put its imbiber under the effect of the ''[[haste]]'' spell.

==Description==
The effect of these potions lasted for a minute each, doubling the imbiber's speed, and raising their durability. Because of that, ''potions of speed'' were commonly used by scouts and heralds

==Creation==
One possible ingredient for creating these potions was sweat from a fast [[horse]].

==Notable Users==
* [[Wessalen Arturia]]
* [[Feldran Exeltis]], a scion of the [[Exeltis]] noble family in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
