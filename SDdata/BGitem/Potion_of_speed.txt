A potion of speed, sometimes called a potion of haste, was a very rare potion that put its imbiber under the effect of the haste spell.
The effect of these potions lasted for a minute each, doubling the imbibers speed, and raising their durability. Because of that, potions of speed were commonly used by scouts and heralds
One possible ingredient for creating these potions was sweat from a fast horse.
