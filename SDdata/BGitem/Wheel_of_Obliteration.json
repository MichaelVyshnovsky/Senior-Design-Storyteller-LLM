        "mainbody": "The '''''Wheel of Obliteration''''' was a powerful [[Sharran]] [[artifact]] that could open and seal shut permanent ''[[portal]]s'' between the [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[Shadowfell]].",
        "Powers": "The ''Wheel of Obliteration'' could only be activated when positioned near a large concentration of ''[[shadow gem]]s''. When in such a location, the artifact weakened the barrier between the Prime and the Shadowfell, allowing for the creation of ''portals'' between the two planes.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, monks of the [[Order of the Dark Moon]] accompanied the ''Wheel of Obliteration'', and its protector [[Yxtrazzal]] to the mines beneath the [[Deepstone clanhold]] in [[Tethyr]]. The [[dwarf]]-held mines were rich with ''shadow gems''.\n\nThe Sharrans enslaved the dwarves of [[Clan Deepstone]] and forced them to mine the special [[gem]]s and to delve deeper than they had before. The Dark Moon's leader [[Alorgoth]] sought to open a ''portal'' to the Shadowfell within the mines, in order to let loose hordes of [[shadow creature]]s to consume the lands above. Fortunately for the people of Tethyr, Alorgoth's plans were thwarted by the [[Sun Soul monk]] [[Rasaad yn Bashir]] and his allies. The ''portal'' was closed in short order and the artifact's protector Yxtrazzal was slain. The ''Wheel of Obliteration'' itself was destroyed after being returned to the mines on [[Toril]], never to be used again.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Yxtrazzal]], a [[shadow dragon]] that had allied herself with [[Shar]] and the Dark Moon."
