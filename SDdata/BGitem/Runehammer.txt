A '''''runehammer''''' was a rare, [[magic]]al ''+1 [[warhammer]]''.

==Description==
''Runehammers'' were typically constructed of [[darksteel]]. A large rune was marked on their head, indicating the spell it carried and giving the item its name.

==Powers==
''Runehammers'' had the ability to cast a single [[spell]] once per day, but the spell was the same each time, stored in the hammer. There were three common types:
# '''Alhalbrin''', which carried the spell ''[[heat metal]]''
# '''Faerindyl''', which carried the spell ''[[burning hands]]''
# '''Thundaril''', which carried the spell ''[[polymorph other]]'', often into the form of either a [[snail]] or [[toad]].

Some sources claimed that these spells could be cast at least six times per day. Each time a ''runehammer's'' power was used there was a very small chance of [[Moradin]] willing it to vanish to another plane, potentially taking along whoever was currently wielding it.

Due to being made of darksteel, all were known to impart a little electricity upon impact.

==Creation==
Forging a ''runehammer'' required the spell that was stored in the weapon.

==Cost==
Depending on the type of spell stored, the hammer could be worth between 11,000 and 18,000 gold pieces.
