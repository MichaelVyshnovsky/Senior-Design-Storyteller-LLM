A runehammer was a rare, magical +1 warhammer.
Runehammers were typically constructed of darksteel. A large rune was marked on their head, indicating the spell it carried and giving the item its name.
Runehammers had the ability to cast a single spell once per day, but the spell was the same each time, stored in the hammer. There were three common types
# Alhalbrin, which carried the spell heat metal
# Faerindyl, which carried the spell burning hands
# Thundaril, which carried the spell polymorph other, often into the form of either a snail or toad.
Some sources claimed that these spells could be cast at least six times per day. Each time a runehammers power was used there was a very small chance of Moradin willing it to vanish to another plane, potentially taking along whoever was currently wielding it.
Due to being made of darksteel, all were known to impart a little electricity upon impact.
Forging a runehammer required the spell that was stored in the weapon.
Depending on the type of spell stored, the hammer could be worth between 11,000 and 18,000 gold pieces.
