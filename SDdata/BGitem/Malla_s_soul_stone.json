        "mainbody": "'''''Malla's soul stone''''' was a unique ''[[ioun stone]]'' imprisoning the soul of [[Malla]], daughter of [[Marlowe]].",
        "Description": "It was a small tear-shaped [[star sapphire]], weighing {{SI|1|lb}}.",
        "Powers": "When attuned, the stone provided several benefits to its bearer: increased agility and dexterity, a stronger constitution, and the power to use ''[[neutralize poison]]'' once each day. However, the knowledge that the stone trapped the soul of an innocent person made it too terrible for good-hearted folk to use.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], the [[lich]] [[Vongoethe]] stole Malla's soul and placed it in this gem, because her father, Marlowe, had refused to give up his own soul after making a deal with the lich for twenty years of prosperity as a merchant. In [[Amkethran]] in [[Amn]], Marlowe sought adventurers such as [[Gorion's Ward]] to deal with the lich. Vongoethe kept the stone with him in his lair in the [[Cave of the Dead]] in Amkethran."
