'''Ankheg plate mail''' was a type of [[chitin armor]], a suit of [[armor]] crafted from the chitinous shell of an [[ankheg]]. Despite its name, it was not ''true'' [[plate mail]] but rather offered its wearer similar protection in combat and could be worn by [[druid]]s.

This armor was highly valued for its lightness, as it weighed significantly less than metal plate armor. As such it cost anywhere from 4,000 - 6,000 [[gp]] and took between one to three days to be made.
