        "mainbody": "'''''Bolts of fire''''' were a type of common [[enchanted]] [[crossbow]] ammunition.",
        "Powers": "These magic [[bolt]]s were individually enchanted to burst into scorching fire once fired. This magical effect was fairly similar to bolts doused in flammable [[oil]] and lit to fire. As such, ''bolts of fire'' pierced and scorched their targets. A stronger variation of these bolts was imbued with a ''+1'' enchantment that guided the missiles to their targets.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''bolts of fire'' were often used along the [[Sword Coast]] region, as well as the [[Moonsea]]. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, ''bolts of fire'' were among arms and armaments smuggled by the pirates to supply a growing [[orc]] and [[tanarukk]]a armies of [[Gorgomorz]], the [[Daggerford]]'s [[Devil]], who was plotting to destroy the city with the aid from the [[Zhentarim]]."
