'''''Backbiter''''' was a unique [[spear]] that carried with it a particularly vicious [[curse]].

==Powers==
While ''Backbiter'' possessed a powerful ''+3 [[item enchantment|enchantment]]'', it was also ''cursed'' in a manner that was harmful to its wielder. Every time it struck an opponent, it struck its wielder as well, inflicting a piercing wound on them as well.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the spear was wielded by the [[Malarite]] [[druid]] [[Osmadi]], who dwelt within [[Larswood]].

By the [[1369 DR|following year]], it had found its way into the [[Underdark]] not far from the [[drow]] city of [[Ust Natha]].
