The '''''Mail of the Hallowed Hero''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] suit of [[chainmail]] armor associated with the [[Argent]] family of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
It was a suit of [[elven]] craftsmanship, having been made by those who lived in the [[Misty Forest]].

==Powers==
The ''Mail of the Hallowed Hero'' possessed a ''+3 enchantment''. It granted its wearer a ''[[Protection from evil|boon against evil foes]]'' and rendered them immune to both [[poison]] and [[disease]].

==History==
The armor was bestowed upon [[Olen Argent]] when he aided the elves of the Misty Forest by hunting down a murdering band of [[Malar]]ite cultists.

Many years later, [[Caelar Argent]] donned the mail when she led the [[Shining Crusade]] to [[War of the Shining Crusade|war]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.
