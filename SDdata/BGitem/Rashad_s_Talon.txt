Rashads Talon was an enchanted scimitar, named after Prince Rashad who ruled a minor region to the east from the Sword Coast.
Rashads Talon possessed a +2 enchantment.
Rashads Talon was the name given to several enchanted scimitar of the same appearance and power that originated from the coasts of the Shining Sea. The namesake of these blades was Prince Rashad, a one-time ruler from one of the municipalities of that region, sometime before 1368 DR. One of these blades, was looted from the Princes possession by palace guards after his death. Dark rumors swirled about theses guards as some suspected them being involved with the rulers death, and all of them mysteriously perished after a year, killed by the very blade they stole, the Rashads Talon.
This blade, however, was not unique as several other similar weapons existed. It was believed that these blades, and similar magic items were much more common in the east of Faer√ªn, so not many scholar and historians of the region kept note of these blades histories and movements. Some of these blades were believed to be owned by rich Vizars or their attendants.
In 1368 DR, three of these scimitars could be found along the Sword Coast. One was stashed away on the roof of the infamous Durlags Tower in the Western Heartlands, another one was could be found in the spider-infested area of Cloak Wood, not far from the nest of Centeol. In Amn, one of the Rashads Talons belonged to Khan Zahraa, a genie merchant from Trademeet.
