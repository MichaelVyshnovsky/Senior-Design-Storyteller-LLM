        "mainbody": "A '''''runehammer''''' was a rare, [[magic]]al ''+1 [[warhammer]]''.",
        "Description": "''Runehammers'' were typically constructed of [[darksteel]]. A large rune was marked on their head, indicating the spell it carried and giving the item its name.",
        "Powers": "''Runehammers'' had the ability to cast a single [[spell]] once per day, but the spell was the same each time, stored in the hammer. There were three common types:\n# '''Alhalbrin''', which carried the spell ''[[heat metal]]''\n# '''Faerindyl''', which carried the spell ''[[burning hands]]''\n# '''Thundaril''', which carried the spell ''[[polymorph other]]'', often into the form of either a [[snail]] or [[toad]].\n\nSome sources claimed that these spells could be cast at least six times per day. Each time a ''runehammer's'' power was used there was a very small chance of [[Moradin]] willing it to vanish to another plane, potentially taking along whoever was currently wielding it.\n\nDue to being made of darksteel, all were known to impart a little electricity upon impact.",
        "Creation": "Forging a ''runehammer'' required the spell that was stored in the weapon.",
