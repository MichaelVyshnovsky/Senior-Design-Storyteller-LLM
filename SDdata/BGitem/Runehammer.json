        "mainbody": "runehammer was a rare, magical +1 warhammer.\nRunehammers were typically constructed of darksteel. A large rune was marked on their head, indicating the spell it carried and giving the item its name.\nRunehammers had the ability to cast a single spell once per day, but the spell was the same each time, stored in the hammer. There were three common types\n# Alhalbrin, which carried the spell heat metal\n# Faerindyl, which carried the spell burning hands\n# Thundaril, which carried the spell polymorph other, often into the form of either a snail or toad.\nSome sources claimed that these spells could be cast at least six times per day. Each time a runehammers power was used there was a very small chance of Moradin willing it to vanish to another plane, potentially taking along whoever was currently wielding it.\nDue to being made of darksteel, all were known to impart a little electricity upon impact.\nForging a runehammer required the spell that was stored in the weapon.\nDepending on the type of spell stored, the hammer could be worth between 11,000 and 18,000 gold pieces.\nVideo Games\n*Baldurs Gate II Throne of Bhaal\n* \nFRMarteau runique\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryPlus-1 items\nCategoryWarhammers\nCategoryDarksteel items\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nCategory10000-14999 gold pieces\nCategory15000-19999 gold pieces\nra9cexl5iqn578hs5svy07ci2uzqwpz"
