The Jansen Spectroscopes, officially referred to as the Jansen Brand  Microâ€“Macro Spectroscopes, was a unique set of glasses invented and worn by the 14 century gnome inventor Jan Jansen. They served as a type of optic aid, giving Jan enhanced vision.
The spectroscopes featured a number of different lenses that were fashioned in an undeniably "stylish" manner.
They were considered to be the official spectroscopes of the Purple Brotherhood.
The spectroscopes allowed Jan to better see through illusions as well as uncover and disable harmful traps. Once per day, Jan could use the glasses to freely see creatures or individuals that were rendered invisible.
