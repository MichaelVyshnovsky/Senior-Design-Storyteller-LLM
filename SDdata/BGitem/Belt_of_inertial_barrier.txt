A belt of inertial barrier was a powerful magical item that offered significant protection to its wearer.
When worn, the belt surrounded an individual with a pocket of air that was significantly more dense than usual. This barrier shielded the wearer from various types of physical harm.
Some of these belts even offered protection from projectiles, harmful spells, and other hazards such as the breath weapon of a dragon.
The pirate Hoisure the Prudent commissioned a number of these belts be made for his crew.
