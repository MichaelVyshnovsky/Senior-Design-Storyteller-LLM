A '''''boomerang dagger''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[throwing dagger]] that returned to the owner's hand once thrown.

==Powers==
These daggers possessed ''+2 enchantments''. They could be wielded as a normal [[dagger]] or thrown at a distance of up to 100 feet (30.5 meters).

==History==
The affluent [[halfling]] [[Fullen Woolspinner]] commissioned the creation of these daggers. He was inspired by the [[dwarven]] [[throwing axe]]s that famously returned to their owner when thrown in battle.

==Notable Owners==
The mercenary captain [[Dennis]] from [[Riatavin]] owned a ''boomerang dagger''.
