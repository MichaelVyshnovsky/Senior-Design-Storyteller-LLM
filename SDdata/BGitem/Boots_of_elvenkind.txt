Boots of elvenkind were magical boots, of elven origin that allowed the wearer to step across any surface quietly.
They were rather soft for boots.
The boots of elvenkind allowed the wearer to walk much more quietly.
They were popular amongst thieves because they were ideal for committing crimes. Thus elven makers were reluctant about letting them fall into foreign hands.
Several pairs of these boots were crafted for elven scouts in 884 DR, and aided in two major battles against mercenaries from Sembia.

The slippers of soft movement from the lands of Zakhara had the same properties as boots of elvenkind, but appeared as slippers, and adjusted themselves to fit the feet of the respective wearer.
