        "mainbody": "The '''''Elven Court bow''''' was an ancient, ceremonial [[longbow]] from the [[Elven Court]], one of cities of the empire of [[Cormanthyr]].",
        "Description": "The bow was made of polished [[yew]] and had been intricately engraved. Its [[bowstring]] shined gold, and emanated a song-like resonance when drawn.",
        "Powers": "This ''+3 longbow'' greatly increased the accuracy of its wielder.",
        "History": "A weapon of the elves for millennia, this exquisite bow was passed down every half-century to someone who had performed a great deed for the elves of the Court. In the midâ€“12{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[human]] named [[Yin Pon]] was gifted the bow of the court after rescuing an [[elven]] prince from danger. Yin carried the bow with him to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] where it was eventually lost."
