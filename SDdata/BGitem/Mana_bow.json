        "mainbody": "The mana bow was a magical longbow whose earliest known whereabouts originated in the city of Athkatla within the country of Amn. It possessed a strong enchantment that protected its wielder from arcane spells and effects.\nWhile its exact origins were unknown, the mana bow was once in the possession of the Cowled Wizards of Athkatla. At one point, it was gifted to the vigilant guardsman Kestsa, who was exceptionally adept at apprehending rogue spellcasters within the City of Coin. It served him well in his duties for quite some time.\nBy 1369 DR, the longbow had made its way to the Forest of Tethir, just a bit outside the elven city of Suldanessellar."
