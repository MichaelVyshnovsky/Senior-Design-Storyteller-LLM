        "mainbody": "The robe of Vecna was a garment once worn by the powerful lich Vecna, who achieved deification among the people of Oerth. It absorbed a great amount of magical energy from the powerful undead being, though it possessed but a fraction of the power that remained within the remnants of his undead form.\nWhen worn, the robe granted the wearer significant protection from magical spells and spell-like abilities. Furthermore, it decreased the time required for them to cast either arcane or divine spells, to a significant degree.\nSeveral various robes of the same name existed. Robes of Vecna found along the Sword Coast were believed to have gained their enchantments via being in the vicinity of the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna as some point in the past. There robes possessed a +1 defensive enchantments and increased focus of abjuration, conjuration, enchantment, evocation, illusion, and necromancy spells. Additionally, the wearer received minor spell resistance.\nWhile it was unknown how the robe of Vecna appeared on Toril, it came into the possession of a merchant named Deirdre during the 14 century DR. Sometime prior to the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR she began selling her wares in the Adventurer Mart of Athkatla.\nBy the late 14 century DR, several robes of Vecna could be found on the Sword Coast"
