The Mighty Oak was a unique enchanted club that belonged to Amarande, the archdruid of the Cloak Wood.
The Mighty Oak was a bumpy and knotted wooden club, crafted out of the hardest and oldest oak from the High Forest.
This bludgeon possessed a +2 enchantment, strong enough to down an adult grizzly bear.
Circa 1368 DR, the Mighty Oak was in the hands of Amarande, the leader of Shadow Druids of Cloak Wood, to the south from the city of Baldurs Gate.
