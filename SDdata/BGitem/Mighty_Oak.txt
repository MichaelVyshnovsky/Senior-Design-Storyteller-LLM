The '''''Mighty Oak''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[club]] that belonged to [[Amarande]], the archdruid of the [[Cloak Wood]].

==Description==
The ''Mighty Oak'' was a bumpy and knotted wooden club, crafted out of the hardest and oldest [[oak]] from the [[High Forest]].

==Powers==
This bludgeon possessed a ''+2'' enchantment, strong enough to down an adult [[grizzly]] [[bear]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1368 DR]], the ''Mighty Oak'' was in the hands of Amarande, the leader of [[Shadow Druids]] of Cloak Wood, to the south from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
