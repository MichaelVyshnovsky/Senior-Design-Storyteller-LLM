The Jade Fang was a unique enchanted jade dagger that once famously belonged to Niu Weidan of Shou Lung many generations before the 14 century DR.
This dagger was sharp enough to split hairs. It was carved out of a single piece of jade and intricately decorated with carvings on both sides of the blade.
The Jade Fang possessed a powerful +3 enchantment and had a chance of stunning its targets upon a successful attack. Additionally, each cut landed on the opponent restored the wielders vitality.
The Jade Fang was created long before its first recorded owner was born. This ancient jade blade likely once had historical or cultural significance, but that lore had been long-lost. Many generations before the , The Jade Fang belonged to the infamous thief named Niu Weidan. He wielded the blade regularly during his life to paralyze his opponents and drain their life force to enhance his own life span. The Jade Fang saved the thiefs hide many times during his career, but eventually, Niu Weidan fell victim to old age. The thiefs family inherited the dagger and treated it as a family heirloom for many generations that followed, never using it in combat. In the , The Jade Fang was interred within one of the tombs of the Crypt of Durkon, presumably, alongside one of Niu Weidans descendants. It mightve left the crypt in the pocket of adventurers who infiltrated the crypt alongside the vampire treasure hunter Hexxat.
