        "History": "Following Kaza's destruction during the final days of ancient [[Netheril]], his namesake book was transported southwest by the lich's followers. It wound up in the region that later came to be known as [[Amn]]. By the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the book's resting place lay within the [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]] of [[Athkatla]].\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the tome was actively sought after by the book collector [[Pimlico]]. He hired [[Korgan Bloodaxe]] and a number of other ne'er-do-wells to retrieve the ''Book of Kaza'' from within a tomb in Athkatla's graveyard."
