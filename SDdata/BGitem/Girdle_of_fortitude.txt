A girdle of fortitude was a magical belt that improved the wearers hardiness and vitality for a limited duration.
Once per day, the wearer of a girdle of fortitude could gain the benefits of its powers for eight hours.
King Violos wore one of these girdles during his later years when leading his people in battle against a group of trolls.
A girdle of fortitude was owned by Gaal, the leader of a cult dedicated to the  Unseeing Eye that operated within the sewers of Athkatla.
