The '''''Protector of the Dryads''''' was a [[magic]]al [[shortbow]] that was created by the [[dryad]]s of the [[Gulthmere Forest]].

==Powers==
The ''Protector'' possessed a ''+2'' [[Item enchantment|enchantment]].

==History==
When a group of [[orc]] loggers threatened their home, the dryads of the Gulthmere presented this bow to the great hero [[Hannable|Hannable the White]]. When the orcs nearly chopped down a great [[oak]] tree, thus killing the dryad that was linked to it, Hannable confronted the orcs. She slayed the entire band before they could inflict any more harm upon the dryads or their woods.

At some point the bow made its way into the hands of the [[assassin]] [[Marek (assassin)|Marek]].
