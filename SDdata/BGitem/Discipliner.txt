Discipliners were cursed rings fashioned after the rings of folly in Narfell.
Discipliners were metallic bands with a round hollow circle in its center, reminiscent of a ring with a missing impeded gemstone.
Just like rings of folly, Discipliners magically and drastically reduced the wearers natural intelligence and wisdom, rendering them drooling idiots and affected them with the feeblemind spell. These rings could only be removed with the remove curse spell, or by a capable cleric.
Discipliners were created by Hergal Norin of Narfell. The wizard used these rings to discipline his most egotistical students. He presented a Discipliner to a student for their "obvious brilliance" to teach them a lesson in humility.
In 1368 DR, several of these rings could be found on the Sword Coast. A mad sage Arcand sought to recover a Discipliner from a certain shipwreck to the south from Baldurs Gate for one deluded reason or the other. Another ring was in the lair of the cursed spider-woman of the Cloak Wood, Centeol. And lastly, one more of these enchanted rings was in possession of a djinni merchant Khan Zahraa in Trademeet on a hunt for a rakshasa. Khan was ready to "reward" an unhelpful adventurer with the cursed ring.
