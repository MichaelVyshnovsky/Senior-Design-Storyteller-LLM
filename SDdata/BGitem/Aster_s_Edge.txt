Waterdeep, Sword Coast North
Asters Edge was an enchanted longsword associated with the Order of the Aster that was said to have bestowed upon holy warriors by a being from the Upper Planes.
The sword personified the tender growth cultivated by Lathanders radiance and the fury possessed by his righteous followers. While the blade of Asters Edge was etched with engravings of aster blossoms, it would also burst into a blue flame when drawn, emitting a silvery-blue radiance.
Asters Edge possessed a powerful +3 enchantment and was especially deadly when wielded against fiendish creatures. It provided its wielder some protection from magical energy and spells.
While the exact origins of Asters Edge were unknown, it was believed to have been handed down to a member of the order from some unknown angelic being. Legend state it was offered as reward for destroying a particularly powerful fiend, which was speculated to have been a balor.
* Caelar Argent, the Shining Lady who famously wielded the sword during the War of the Shining Crusade.
