The Ravager was a powerful, magical halberd of unknown origin. It was an absolutely gruesome weapon with a shaft that continually dripped with blood.
The +4 halberd allowed the wielder to cast the spell cloak of fear twice per day. If the head of the Ravager was combined with the serpent shaft, it was capable of near-effortless decapitation.
While it was not known where the Ravager was forged, or even if it came from Toril at all, it made an appearance in a notable battle during the Bhaalspawn saga, in the year 1369 DR. It was wielded by Imix, the Elemental Prince of Fire, as he defended the subterranean lair of Yaga-Shura.
