'''''The Ravager''''' was a powerful, [[magic]]al [[halberd]] of unknown origin. It was an absolutely gruesome weapon with a shaft that continually dripped with blood.

==Powers==
The ''+4 halberd'' allowed the wielder to cast the spell ''[[cloak of fear]]'' twice per day. If the head of ''the Ravager'' was combined with the ''[[serpent shaft]]'', it was capable of near-effortless decapitation.

==History==
While it was not known where ''the Ravager'' was forged, or even if it came from [[Toril]] at all, it made an appearance in a notable battle during the [[Bhaalspawn]] saga, in the year [[1369 DR]]. It was wielded by [[Imix]], the ''Elemental Prince of [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Fire]]'', as he defended the subterranean lair of [[Yaga-Shura]].
