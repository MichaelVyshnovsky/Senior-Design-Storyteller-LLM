An amulet of spell warding was a type of enchanted amulet that protected the wearer from magical spells and spell-like abilities. They were favored among mages who planned on participating in mage duels.
These amulets offered an individual significant protection from magic, in all of its forms. Fortunately for spellcasters, they did not interfere with how they practiced the Art, or in the case of priests, how they accessed the Power.
