'''''Harrower''''' was a [[magic]]al [[longsword]].

==Description==
The double-edged blade was inscribed on both sides with the word "Harrower" in [[Dethek]]. It seemed to emanate a white glow, even in the presence of other sources of light, such as red torchlight.

==Powers==
''Harrower'' was particularly effective against [[undead]] foes.

==History==
It was originally wielded by the [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] [[paladin]] [[Ariabel]]. She used the sword to fight the [[vampire]] [[Zerafex]], but was overcome by the undead creature. Decades later, ''Harrower'' was recovered from Zerafex's crypt by a group of [[Tethyrian]] tomb robbers.
