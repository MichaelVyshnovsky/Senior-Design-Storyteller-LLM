Harrower was a magical longsword.
The double-edged blade was inscribed on both sides with the word "Harrower" in Dethek. It seemed to emanate a white glow, even in the presence of other sources of light, such as red torchlight.
Harrower was particularly effective against undead foes.
It was originally wielded by the Waterdhavian paladin Ariabel. She used the sword to fight the vampire Zerafex, but was overcome by the undead creature. Decades later, Harrower was recovered from Zerafexs crypt by a group of Tethyrian tomb robbers.
