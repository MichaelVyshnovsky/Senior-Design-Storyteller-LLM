'''''The Victor''''' was a [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[ring]] of [[drow]] origin that could emit a beam of energy that damaged any person or creature it struck.

==Powers==
When fully-charged, ''the Victor'' could be used 50 times before being depleted. The magical blast that shot out from the ring had a range of 150' (45.7 m) and struck a single target.

==History==
The ring was originally crafted by [[drow]] artisans of the [[Underdark]]. It was used to great effect when two drow combatants from rival [[:Category:Drow houses|houses]] engaged in a duel with one another. While each were allowed the use of a single [[:Category:magic items|magical item]], although the winner never placed ''the Victor'' on his finger. His brother used the ring from within the crowd that was observing the duel, striking his sibling's opponent in the back and ensuring their loss. The witnesses all agreed this was a brilliant tactic and just interpretation of the combatants' rules.

At some point after its creation, ''the Victor'' came into the possession of the [[Red Wizard]] [[Denak]].
