        "Powers": "The ''+2 longsword'' was more potent when wielded against evil beings and extremely destructive to the undead. Once per day, its wielder could cast the spell ''[[sunray]]''. It was unknown if this boon was imbued into the blade during the [[item enchantment|enchantment process]] or was divinely granted from Torm himself.",
        "History": "While the exact origins of the sword were unknown, it had long been used in the service of the god of duty and loyalty. By the midâ€“14{{th}} century, it had been hidden away in the tomb of a [[lich]], located behind a hidden door in the back of the [[Crooked Crane]] in the [[Amn]]ian city of [[Athkatla]]. [[Scottie Torilson]], who died in [[713 DR]], was said to be the possesor of the one true Daystar. <ref>[[BioWare]] (June 2002). Designed by [[Brent Knowles]], [[James Ohlen]].
