        "mainbody": "'''''Batalista's Passport''''' was a variation of a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'' originally created by the grand mage [[Batalista]].",
        "Powers": "''Batalista's Passport'' allowed the wearer to survive even the hottest of flames, granting them resistance to fire.",
        "History": "The original ring of ''Batalista's Passport'' was created by the grand mage Batalista to protect him through his travels through the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. It was believed that the [[wizard]] summoned [[salamander]]s to consult them during the ring's crafting process. However, salamanders were not known for their patience. Batalista's consultant was annoyed with harassment by a mortal mage. A mysterious pyre engulfed the grand mage's tower with only one thing recovered from the ashes - Batalista's finger with the ''Passport'' on it, untouched by the raging flames. It was presumed that if the ring's finger was still attached to the wizard's hand Batalista would've survived the fire.\n\nOver the years that followed ''Batalista's Passport'' was replicated and found in several locations across the [[Sword Coast]], in the vicinity of [[Baldur's Gate]], and even in the [[Black Pits]] of [[Underdark]]. One of these rings could be found in catacombs under [[Candlekeep]] as well as in the [[iron]] mines of [[Nashkel]] in [[1368 DR]].",
        "Uses": "A ring of ''Batalista's Passport'' could be used along with a regular ''ring of fire resistance'' to drastically strengthen enchantments on a ''[[Club of Detonation]]'' to a powerful ''+5'' variation. The [[imp]] named [[Cespenar]] knew the secrets of that process.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Ruhk Transmuter]]: a [[rakshasa]] in service of the [[red dragon]] [[Firkraag]] in [[1369 DR]].\n*[[Xithiss]]: a [[mind flayer]] trader who was under [[Baeloth Barrityl]]'s in his gladiatorial arena of the Black Pits."
