        "History": "There were legends that stated the ''Brawling Hands'' were worn a master of the martial arts who brought them to [[Faer√ªn]] after a long journey from the Far East.\n\nWhile it was not exactly known how these [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[gauntlet]]s first arrived on the [[Sword Coast]] they were seen in the possession of an [[ogrillon]] named [[Hairtooth]]. The [[half-orc]]/[[ogre]] regularly extorted travelers at a bridge crossing with his comrade [[Gnarl]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
