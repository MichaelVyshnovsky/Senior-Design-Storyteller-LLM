They were favored among mages who planned on participating in mage duels.\nThese amulets offered an individual significant protection from magic, in all of its forms. Fortunately for spellcasters, they did not interfere with how they practiced the Art, or in the case of priests, how they accessed the Power.\n*Kryll an evil necromancer who plagued areat to the east from Nashkel mines in 1368 DR.\n*Xithiss a mind flayer trader under Baeloth Barrityls control from the Black Pits of Underdark."
