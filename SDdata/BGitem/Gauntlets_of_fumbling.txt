'''''Gauntlets of fumbling''''' was a name given to various [[glove]]s and [[gauntlet]]s that all possessed similar ''[[curse]]'', found in [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
These items could be crafted out of hardy [[leather]], [[ring mail]], [[chain mail]], or any other material.

==Powers==
In appearance, they often looked almost indistinguishable from ''[[gauntlets of dexterity]]'' or ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'', which made the ''curse'' even more dangerous. If someone were to test the gauntlets' magic, they would be completely convinced that the items they were wearing were harmless. That changed, however, come the battle as combat was the ''curse's'' activation. The ''curse'' crippled the wearer's nimbleness, aim, and dexterity. Like other ''cursed'' items, ''gauntlets of fumbling'' could only be taken off via ''[[remove curse]]''.

==Notable Gloves of Fumbling==
*'''''Elander's gloves of misplacement''''': Created by mischievous [[Elander]] in order to defeat his bitter rival sometime before [[1368 DR]], these ''cursed'' gloves never reached their intended party. Elander fell victim to his own malice when he mistook his ''gloves of misplacement'' for a regular pair. Subsequently, in 1368 DR these gloves found a way onto the hands of crazed [[priest]] of [[Cryirc]], [[Bassilus|Bassilus the Murderer]] of [[Beregost]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Tsenya Bhrokiti]]: the princess of [[Ra-Khati]] was gifted a handful of ''cursed'' items by [[Ambuchar Devayam]] in [[1360 DR]], one of which was a get of ''gauntlets of fumbling''.

==Creation==
''Gauntlets of fumbling'' could be created by a skilled wondrous item crafter with the use of ''[[bestow curse]]'' spell.
