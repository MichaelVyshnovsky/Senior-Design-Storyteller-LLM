Gauntlets of fumbling was a name given to various gloves and gauntlets that all possessed similar curse, found in Faer√ªn.
These items could be crafted out of hardy leather, ring mail, chain mail, or any other material.
In appearance, they often looked almost indistinguishable from gauntlets of dexterity or gauntlets of ogre power, which made the curse even more dangerous. If someone were to test the gauntlets magic, they would be completely convinced that the items they were wearing were harmless. That changed, however, come the battle as combat was the curses activation. The curse crippled the wearers nimbleness, aim, and dexterity. Like other cursed items, gauntlets of fumbling could only be taken off via remove curse.
