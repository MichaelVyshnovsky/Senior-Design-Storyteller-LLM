        "mainbody": "The ninjatō of the Scarlet Brotherhood was an enchanted blade used by members of the Scarlet Brotherhood on the world of Oerth.\nNinjatō of the Scarlet Brotherhood were deadly weapons, being similar in their enchantments to scimitars of speed. They allowed the wielder to land more slashes in a shorter period of time. Additionally, these blades were enhanced with a potent +3 enchantment to their aim and deadliness. Each slash of such ninjatō introduced deadly poison into the wounds. Lastly, when unsheathed, ninjatō of the Scarlet Brotherhood glowed with a blood-red radiance.\nThese swords originated on Oerth, where they were rewards given to the members of the Scarlet Brotherhood who successfully eliminated the organizations \"great enemies.\" How or when one of these blades arrived on Toril was unknown. However, in the , a ninjatō of the Scarlet Brotherhood, along with several other magic items from Icewind Dale, ended up in the hands of the merchant named Joluv who traveled from Icewind Dale to the City of Coin, Athkatla, to sell the items to wealthy Amnian adventurers. Joluv sold his wares from the Copper Coronet in Athkatlas River District."
