        "Powers": "''Suryris's Blade'' was a weapon that dispensed both piercing and slashing damage, aided by its ''+2'' enchantment.",
        "History": "''Suryris's Blade'' was named after its first known owner, [[Suryris]], the albino minotaur of the [[Orsraun Mountains]] in Turmish. Suryris traveled in search of battle and challenged fighters and warriors to duels while wielding his enchanted halberd. Unlike many minotaurs, Suryris treated battle honorably and never slew his defeated opponents. Eventually, Suryris met his match after a duel that lasted for several hours. The minotaur conceded after his opponent's [[sword]] broke, and Suryris presented his weapon to the opponent. The man who bested Suryris told the story of ''Suryris's Blade'' to anyone interested in the story of the white bull.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Suryris's Blade'' ended up in the hands of [[Zhalimar Cloudwulfe]], a [[fighter]] in service to [[Sarevok Anchev]] of the [[Iron Throne]] in its [[Baldur's Gate]] headquarters."
