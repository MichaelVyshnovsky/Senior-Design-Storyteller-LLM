        "mainbody": "Suryriss Blade was an enchanted halberd once famously wielded by an honorable minotaur of Turmish, Suryris, some years before the late 14 century DR.\nSuryriss Blade was a weapon that dispensed both piercing and slashing damage, aided by its +2 enchantment.\nSuryriss Blade was named after its first known owner, Suryris, the albino minotaur of the Orsraun Mountains in Turmish. Suryris traveled in search of battle and challenged fighters and warriors to duels while wielding his enchanted halberd. Unlike many minotaurs, Suryris treated battle honorably and never slew his defeated opponents. Eventually, Suryris met his match after a duel that lasted for several hours. The minotaur conceded after his opponents sword broke, and Suryris presented his weapon to the opponent. The man who bested Suryris told the story of Suryriss Blade to anyone interested in the story of the white bull.\nBy the , Suryriss Blade ended up in the hands of Zhalimar Cloudwulfe, a fighter in service to Sarevok Anchev of the Iron Throne in its Baldurs Gate headquarters."
