        "mainbody": "The '''''Glimmer of Hope''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[mace]] associated with the [[Ilmatari]] faith.",
        "Description": "It was so named for the small [[diamond]] that was set into its point. On occasion the diamond radiated a bright light.",
        "Powers": "The mace possessed a ''+2 enchantment'' and imbued its wielder with an improved sense of foresight and understanding.\n\nOn occasion, it filled the wielder and their allies with renewed ''[[bless|feelings of divine optimism]]''.",
        "History": "The ''Glimmer of Hope'' was originally carried by a pacifist [[priest]] of Ilmater. He refused to wield the weapon in combat, a stance that cost him his life when he was slain by [[bandit]]s.\n\nThe priest's mace was found by his fellow clergymen and taken back to their temple. Upon examination they discovered the diamond which was not previously there."
