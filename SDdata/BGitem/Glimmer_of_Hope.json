        "mainbody": "The Glimmer of Hope was an enchanted mace associated with the Ilmatari faith.\nIt was so named for the small diamond that was set into its point. On occasion the diamond radiated a bright light.\nThe mace possessed a +2 enchantment and imbued its wielder with an improved sense of foresight and understanding.\nOn occasion, it filled the wielder and their allies with renewed feelings of divine optimism.\nThe Glimmer of Hope was originally carried by a pacifist priest of Ilmater. He refused to wield the weapon in combat, a stance that cost him his life when he was slain by bandits.\nThe priests mace was found by his fellow clergymen and taken back to their temple. Upon examination they discovered the diamond which was not previously there."
