        "mainbody": "A Sandthiefs ring was a variety of ring of invisibility that could be traced back to the Waterdhavian master thief known as the Sand Thief.\nThree times per day, the wearer of this ring could cast invisibility upon themself.\nThe Sand Thief was a bold criminal, who brazenly stole purses and other valuables from the nobility of Waterdeep. He replaced anything he stole with bags of sand and was never caught thanks to the use of his set of magical rings. Eventually the Sand Thief was killed, and his rings were used by a band of cutpurses that abused both his treasured rings along with his methodology."
