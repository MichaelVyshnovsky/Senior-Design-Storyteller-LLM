Krotans Skullcrusher was the name given to several enchanted bludgeons.
There were several types of these weapons created. Some were simple like maces, while others such as heavy two-handed dire maces were more elaborate. All of them, however, bore permanent stains from all the blood they spilled over the years.
Krotans Skullcrushers possessed +1 or +3 enchantments and when wielded against orcs, half-orcs, or goblinoids, these weapons caused additional harm.
As the late 14 century DR, Krotans Skullcrushers became popular along the Sword Coast, however, many of their wielders liked to hide the deeds and history of these maces.
*Goldander Blackenrock, the king of a svirfneblin community beneath Tethyr circa the late 14 century DR.
