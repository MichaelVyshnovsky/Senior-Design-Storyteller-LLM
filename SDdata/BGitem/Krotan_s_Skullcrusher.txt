'''''[[Krotan's Skullcrusher]]''''' was the name given to several [[enchanted]] bludgeons.

==Description==
There were several types of these weapons created. Some were simple like [[mace]]s, while others such as heavy two-handed [[dire mace]]s were more elaborate. All of them, however, bore permanent stains from all the blood they spilled over the years.

==Powers==
''Krotan's Skullcrushers'' possessed ''+1'' or ''+3'' enchantments and when wielded against [[orc]]s, [[half-orc]]s, or [[goblinoid]]s, these weapons caused additional harm.

==History==
As the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Krotan's Skullcrushers'' became popular along the [[Sword Coast]], however, many of their wielders liked to hide the deeds and history of these maces.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Goldander Blackenrock]], the king of a [[svirfneblin]] community beneath [[Tethyr]] ''circa'' the late 14{{th}} century DR.
