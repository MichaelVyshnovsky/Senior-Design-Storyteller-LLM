'''''Tuigan bows''''' were [[enchanted]] [[shortbow]]s crafted by the [[Tuigan]] people of the [[Endless Wastes]] steppes.

==Powers==
''Tuigan bows'' were masterfully crafted specifically to accommodate mobile Tuigan [[horse]]back riders. The process of the bows creation was a closely guarded sacred, but these weapons possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and could be shot at a dazzling speed, thrice quicker than any ordinary shortbow.

==History==
''Tuigan bows'' found their way into the hands of the inhabitants of the [[Sword Coast]] following the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] invasion of the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, one such bow was in the hands of the Beastmaster who worked in the illicit fighting pits in the [[Copper Coronet]] in the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]].
