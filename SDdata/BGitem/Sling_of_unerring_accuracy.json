        "Powers": "These slings' enchantment was similar to that of a ''+1'' weapon, though they only improved the wielder's aim.",
        "History": "Sometime before [[1368 DR]], a ''sling of unerring accuracy'' was famously wielded by one of the great [[halfling]] heroes, Dandifox. The hin bandit attacked passing trade caravans from hiding, pelleting them with his magic sling and collecteds \"tithe\" to later distribute among local commoners. Local law enforcement came to fear and hate the halfling's perfect aim when used against them. Eventually, Dandifox was skewered by a guardsman with a spear, ending his life.\n\nIn 1368 DR, one of these slings was hidden inside a chest on the second floor of [[Splurging Sturgeon]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], and sold by [[Black Lily]], a member of the [[Thieves' Guild of Baldur's Gate|Thieves' Guild]]."
