        "mainbody": "Slings of unerring accuracy were somewhat uncommon enchanted hin slings made popular by Dandifox.\nThese slings enchantment was similar to that of a +1 weapon, though they only improved the wielders aim.\nSometime before 1368 DR, a sling of unerring accuracy was famously wielded by one of the great halfling heroes, Dandifox. The hin bandit attacked passing trade caravans from hiding, pelleting them with his magic sling and collecteds \"tithe\" to later distribute among local commoners. Local law enforcement came to fear and hate the halflings perfect aim when used against them. Eventually, Dandifox was skewered by a guardsman with a spear, ending his life.\nIn 1368 DR, one of these slings was hidden inside a chest on the second floor of Splurging Sturgeon of Baldurs Gate, and sold by Black Lily, a member of the Thieves Guild."
