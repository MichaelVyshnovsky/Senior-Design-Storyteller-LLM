The '''''robe of Vecna''''' was a garment once worn by the powerful [[lich]] [[Vecna]], who achieved deification among the people of [[Oerth]]. It absorbed a great amount of [[magic]]al energy from the powerful [[undead]] being, though it possessed but a fraction of the power that remained within the remnants of his undead form.

==Powers==
When worn, the robe granted the wearer significant protection from magical spells and spell-like abilities. Furthermore, it decreased the time required for them to cast either [[arcane]] or [[divine]] spells, to a significant degree.

Several various robes of the same name existed. ''Robes of Vecna'' found along the [[Sword Coast]] were believed to have gained their enchantments via being in the vicinity of the ''[[Eye of Vecna]]'' and the ''[[Hand of Vecna]]'' as some point in the past. There robes possessed a ''+1'' defensive enchantments and increased focus of ''[[abjuration]]'', ''[[conjuration]]'', ''[[enchantment]]'', ''[[evocation]]'', ''[[illusion]]'', and ''[[necromancy]]'' spells. Additionally, the wearer received minor spell resistance.

==History==
While it was unknown how the ''robe of Vecna'' appeared on [[Toril]], it came into the possession of a merchant named [[Deirdre]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sometime prior to the [[1369|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]] she began selling her wares in the [[Adventurer Mart]] of [[Athkatla]].

By the late 14{{th}} century DR, several ''robes of Vecna'' could be found on the [[Sword Coast]]
