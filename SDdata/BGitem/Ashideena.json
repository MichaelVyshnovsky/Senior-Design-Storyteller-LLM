        "mainbody": "Ashideena was a magical warhammer, named after the brilliant military strategist Lady Ashideena, that dated back to the 13 century DR.\nThis warhammer possessed a +2 enchantment that shocked any person or creature it struck.\nThe hammer was originally wielded by Dergat Wiltoon, a grave warrior who served as the Field Captain of Lady Ashideena. The two served together during the entire conflict that surrounded the Black Horde ravaging the lands of the North, the Sword Coast and the Lands of Intrigue in the Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR.\nFollowing the war, Lady Ashideena and Dergat fell in love with one another and eventually got married. It was rumored that Dergat named his weapon after his bride as a reminder of their love and how hard he had fought to preserve it in the face of war.\nAt some point prior to the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR Ashideena or its copy came into the possession of the deranged Cyricist cleric, Bassilus. At some point long before 1368 DR, another Ashideena was stashed near a temple dedicated to Amaunator underneath the Temple District of Athkatla. Another replica could be found in use around the gladiatorial arena in Thay run by Dennaton, a Red Wizard."
