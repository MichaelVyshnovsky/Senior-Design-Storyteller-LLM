        "mainbody": "'''''Crom Faeyr''''' was a unique, but ultimately unfinished ''[[Hammer of Thunderbolts]]'' crafted by the [[dwarven]] smith known only as [[Silverblade]].",
        "Description": "Even without its full powers, ''Crom Faeyr'' was a powerful [[warhammer]]. \n\nAlong with ''Crom Faeyr'', Silverblade crafted a ''[[girdle of frost giant strength]]'' and a pair of ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'', which he intended to use during the last parts of the [[item enchantment|enchanting]] process. The remaining steps were outlined on a ''[[scroll]]'', uniquely inscribed for the creation of this great weapon.While it was possible to forge the completed ''Crom Faeyr'' in the ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' video game,",
        "Powers": "In its unfinished state, ''Crom Faeyr'' possessed a ''+3 enchantment'' and granted its wielder no other boons. \n\nIt was believed that when the hammer was imbued with its full powers it would imbue into its wielder the strength of a [[frost giant]].  \n\nFurthermore, Silverblade had intended for ''Crom Faeyr'' to possess the power to instantly kill [[troll]]s, [[ettin]]s, and even [[golem]]s with a single strike.",
        "History": "Silverblade crafted the hammer, along with the other components needed to finalize its enchantments, with the intention of granting it to his son. He could do so however, as his son died while fighting in the dwarven army, battling against [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s. \n\nOvercome with grief, Silverblade took up the unfinished hammer, armed himself with the belt and gauntlets set out to a noble end fighting the monsters that slew his son. \n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the weapon was still unfinished. It made its way into the hands of a group of [[mind flayer]]s who established a hidden refuge in [[Athkatla/Sewers|the sewers]] beneath [[Athkatla]]. \n\nThe girdle and gloves were scattered across [[Amn]], while the [[scroll]] that detailed the process to active the full powers of ''Crom Faeyr'' came into the possession of the [[shadow dragon]] [[Thaxll'ssillyia]]."
