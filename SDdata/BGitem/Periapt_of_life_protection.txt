'''''Periapts of life protection''''' were invaluable life-saving [[enchanted]] [[amulet]]s.

==Description==
''Periapts of life protection'' were delicate amulets of a single large [[sapphire]], roughly the size of a [[human]] heart, hung on a thin [[silver]] chain. They bore an engraving at the periapts' back side: "Against Death we must all fail, but with this [[gem]] we may still prevail!"

==Powers==
These items bore simple enchantments that significantly increased the chances of the wearer's survival when faced with perilous odds.

==History==
One such amulet was kept within the [[Crypt of Durkon]] in the faraway land of [[Shou Lung]], infiltrated by the [[vampire]] [[Hexxat]] under the orders from the great [[lich]] [[Larloch]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. Another ''periapt of life protection'' was in possession of the [[Church of Lathander]] in his [[Temple of Lathander (Athkatla)|temple]] in the city of [[Athkatla]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Xithiss]], a [[mindflayer]] who worked for [[Baeloth Barrityl]] in his [[underdark]] coliseum â€“ the [[Black Pits]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
