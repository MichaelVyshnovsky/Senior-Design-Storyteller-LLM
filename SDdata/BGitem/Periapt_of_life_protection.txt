Periapts of life protection were invaluable life-saving enchanted amulets.
Periapts of life protection were delicate amulets of a single large sapphire, roughly the size of a human heart, hung on a thin silver chain. They bore an engraving at the periapts back side "Against Death we must all fail, but with this gem we may still prevail!"
These items bore simple enchantments that significantly increased the chances of the wearers survival when faced with perilous odds.
One such amulet was kept within the Crypt of Durkon in the faraway land of Shou Lung, infiltrated by the vampire Hexxat under the orders from the great lich Larloch in the . Another periapt of life protection was in possession of the Church of Lathander in his temple in the city of Athkatla.
