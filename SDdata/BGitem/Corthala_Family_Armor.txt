The Corthala Family Armor was a suit of armor specifically made for the Corthala family and its last heir, Valygar. 
Though powerful, with a +2 enhancement bonus, it was still light enough not to impede Valygars stalker abilities. It also granted immunity to charm spells and gave a resistance to fire, acid and magic damage.
