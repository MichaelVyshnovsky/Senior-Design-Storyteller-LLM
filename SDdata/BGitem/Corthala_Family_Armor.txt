The '''Corthala Family Armor''' was a suit of [[armor]] specifically made for the Corthala family and its last heir, [[Valygar]]. 

==Abilities==
Though powerful, with a ''+2'' enhancement bonus, it was still light enough not to impede Valygar's stalker abilities. It also granted immunity to ''[[charm]]'' spells and gave a resistance to fire, acid and magic damage.<ref>
