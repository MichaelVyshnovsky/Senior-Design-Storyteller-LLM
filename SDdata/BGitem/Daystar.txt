Daystar was a magical longsword that was favored by the Church of Torm, used by his followers in their battles against the undead.
The +2 longsword was more potent when wielded against evil beings and extremely destructive to the undead. Once per day, its wielder could cast the spell sunray. It was unknown if this boon was imbued into the blade during the enchantment process or was divinely granted from Torm himself.
While the exact origins of the sword were unknown, it had long been used in the service of the god of duty and loyalty. By the midâ€“14 century, it had been hidden away in the tomb of a lich, located behind a hidden door in the back of the Crooked Crane in the Amnian city of Athkatla. Scottie Torilson, who died in 713 DR, was said to be the possesor of the one true Daystar. BioWare (June 2002). Designed by Brent Knowles, James Ohlen. Neverwinter Nights. Atari.
