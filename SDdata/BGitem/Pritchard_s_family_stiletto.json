        "mainbody": "Pritchards family stiletto was an enchanted dagger named for its most recent owner Pritchard Gardnersonson.\nThe dagger was designed with smaller, gnome-sized humanoids in mind. It was a valued heirloom of the gnomish Gardnersonson family.\nQuite powerful despite its slender size, the stiletto possessed a +2 enchantment. It was especially deadly when wielded against larger humanoids, such as ogres, ettins, and even giants.\nIt was wielded by Pritchards father, the patriarch of the Gardnersonson family, for many years. He carried it with him while fighting in the First Dragonspear War of 1356 DR, and again in the Second Dragonspear War of 1363 DR."
