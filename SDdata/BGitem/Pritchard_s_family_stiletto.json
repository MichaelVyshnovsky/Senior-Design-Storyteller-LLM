        "mainbody": "'''''Pritchard's family stiletto''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[stiletto|dagger]] named for its most recent owner [[Pritchard Gardnersonson]].",
        "Description": "The [[dagger]] was designed with smaller, [[gnome]]-sized [[humanoid]]s in mind. It was a valued heirloom of the gnomish Gardnersonson family.",
        "Powers": "Quite powerful despite its slender size, the stiletto possessed a ''+2 enchantment''. It was especially deadly when wielded against larger humanoids, such as [[ogre]]s, [[ettin]]s, and even [[giant]]s.",
        "History": "It was wielded by Pritchard's father, the patriarch of the Gardnersonson family, for many years. He carried it with him while fighting in the [[First Dragonspear War]] of [[1356 DR]], and again in the [[Second Dragonspear War]] of [[1363 DR]]."
