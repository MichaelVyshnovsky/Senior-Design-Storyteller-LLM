'''''Nimblefinger gloves''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves that boosted the wearer's finger dexterity and fortified their sleight of hand skills.

==Description==
''Nimblefinger gloves'' were crafted out of the softest finest [[doe]] [[leather]] that offered warmth and protection to the wearer. The gloves were designed specifically to fit a gnomish hand perfectly so that they felt like the wearer's second skin.

==Powers==
Any creature who wore the gloves had their sleight of hand skills slightly boosted, however, small folk, like [[hin]] or [[dwarves]] also had their overall dexterity slightly boosted, while [[gnome]]s received both boons with their overall dexterity boosted even further.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Rhonda Swiftfootsdottir]], a family member of [[Glint Gardnersonson]], possessed a pair of these enchanted gloves, possibly giving them to Glint as a gift.

A pair of ''nimblefinger gloves'' was sold by the merchant [[Bumpnagel]] of [[Clan Ironhand]], a [[deep gnome]] clan of [[artificer]]s from [[Baldur's Gate]], in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
