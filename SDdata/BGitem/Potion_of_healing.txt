'''''Potions of healing''''' were magic [[potion]]s that healed the wounds of the creatures who drank them.
{{quote|''Healing quaff. You never forget the taste. A priest of [[Tempus]] fed me one, once; cost me all the [[coin]]s I had. My thanks!''|[[Agannor Wildsilver]]}}

==Description==
''Healing potions'' varied in color, viscosity, and flavor. Most commonly seen potions of blue, slightly phosphorescent hue could be found on the [[Sword Coast North]], [[Turmish]], and [[Messemprar]] in [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]]. These potions typically had a pleasant scent of [[honey]] and [[orange]] blossoms. A milky variety was known in the city of [[Keczulla]] in [[Amn]]. And some nobles on [[Waterdeep]] used thick ''healing potions'' of purple color.

Among other flavors, ''healing potions'' could resemble warm [[mead]], sweet but heady to taste, or be [[honey]]-[[herb]] scented. In [[Velen]], a special recipe of ''healing potions'' with [[mint]]y flavor was known to Madame [[Litaar]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Some ''potions of healing'' were known to be a red liquid that shimmered when agitated within its [[vial]].

Many ''healing potions'' were marked with a universal sign – a circle, or more complex circle surrounded by radiating rays. The symbol was used by healers and potion makers to indicate the remedial properties of the potions. The symbols were usually placed on vials directly or on the [[wax]] seals over the stoppers.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-02-21 - Universal Healing Potion Sign}}

==Powers==
Upon drinking a ''potion of healing'', some of a creature's wounds healed within seconds. There were several different types of ''potions of healing'', which varied mostly by the intensity of their curative power. A ''potion of healing's'' curative magic was an effective remedy for muscles, atrophied from being unused.

Any variety of ''potion of healing'' could be brewed by anyone skilled with the use of a [[herbalism kit]],

==History==
[[File:Potion of greater healing.png|thumb|''A flask of [[potion of greater healing]].'']]
{{quote|''Thanks - down the hatch... Echkk! Pah! You'd think those damn alchemists could learn to make potions that taste like [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[stout]] instead of gutter runoff.''|[[Reig Redwaters]]}}<br/>
In mid-14{{th}} century DR, a [[halfling]] curio merchant in the [[Yawning Portal]], Nalbas, was selling his strange versions of ''potions of healing'' claiming them to be as potent as any other version of the ''potion'' with the only difference being a bitter taste.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''potions of healing'' and ''potions of greater healing'' produced by the [[wood elf]] [[druid]] [[Fala Lefaliir]] were available for purchase at [[Corellon's Crown]], a store located in [[Trollskull Alley]] in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Varieties==
; ''Fey healing'': The [[elves]] of [[New Sharandar]] formulated a variety of these potions called ''potions of fey healing''.
; ''Gourd of healing brew'' and ''herbal healing brew'': the closest alternative to a regular ''healing potion'' found on the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. These shamanistic mild-tasting concoctions were kept in hollowed-out orange [[gourd]]s. ''Herbal healing brew'' acted faster when consumed before sleep, if consumed during waking hours, the curative herbs used caused the imbiber to be physically weakened for six hours.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|15-16}}
; ''Healing quaff'': A clear odorless and colorless potion from [[Cormyr]] that sparkled and tasted of tingling, like swallowing a cool breeze.
; ''Paste of healing'': The people of [[Serôs]] had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion,<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}} suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a ''paste of healing'' consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either [[clam]]shells or flexible tubes made from [[eel]]skin.<ref>

==Creation==
A basic ''potion of healing'' could be created using [[salt]] of [[rogue's morsel]] and an alchemic suspension, while a ''greater potion of healing'' could be created using ashes of [[balsam]] and a type of salt, a ''superior potion of healing'' could be created using salt of [[yellow musk creeper]] petals and an alchemic suspension, and a ''supreme potion of healing'' could be created using a sublimate of [[ki-rin]] hair and plant ashes.

One of the suggested ingredients for crafting a ''potion of healing'' or a ''potion of extra healing'' was [[honey]] from [[giant bee]]s.

''[[Blueglow moss]]'' could be distilled into a potent ''potion of healing'', distinct for its blue color. Although, just like the moss itself, it likely lost its restorative qualities when taken outside of the ''[[mythal]]'s'' borders.
