        "mainbody": "A '''''helm of brilliance''''' was a type of [[magic]]ally [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[helmet]] that allowed the wearer to cast a number of radiant, [[spell]]-like abilities. These [[Lathander]]ite helmets originated from the [[Sword Coast]], some time well before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The helm was crafted from polished [[steel]], with crown-like spikes that were inset with a number of glowing gems. These included ''[[opal]]s'', ''[[diamond]]s'', ''[[fire opal]]''s, and ''[[ruby|rubies]]'', which gleamed with a fantastic, [[magic]]al light that emanated from within. When a bright light shone upon the helm's jewels they would shine out in a fantastic display of radiance.",
        "Powers": "The helm bestowed upon the wearer some protection against fire and emitted a faint light out for {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} that harmed the [[undead]], and the [[magic]]-imbued jewels granted them the power to cast certain [[arcane]] [[spell]]s a select number of times each day. Among these were ''[[flame lash]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[daylight]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]''. and ''[[sunray]]''.\n\nEach of the spells corresponded to one of the gems: ''fireball'' from the fire opals, ''prismatic spray'' from the diamonds, ''etc''. If all of the gems were removed from the helm, after which they would dissolve into dust, it would lose its magical powers and enchantments.",
        "History": "The ''helms of brilliance'' originated from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], having been crafted by the renowned [[cleric]] of [[Lathander]] named [[Ergelion]]. He bestowed these helms upon his friends before they set out to destroy a horde of undead that was beginning to overrun the [[Troll Hills]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Although those heroes were never heard from again, they succeeded in their task in halting the army of the dead.\n\nFew of these helms still exited in [[Faerûn]] in the years following the [[Time of Troubles]] which took place in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], though there was at least one still on Toril following the [[Second Sundering]].",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Daelegoth Orndeir]] owned a ''helm of brilliance'' called the ''Corona of Amaunator''.\n*[[Thovana Jorgadul]], the mayor of the town of [[Elmwood]] who kept a ''helm of brilliance'' from her adventuring days."
