Beruels Retort were a pair of enchanted dwarven throwing axes that could as easily be wielded in melee as they were effective at a great range.
The Beruels Retort axes were short-hafted weapons of steel and silver. These axes were designed to penetrate thick orcish skulls.
These thrown axes were silvered and possessed a +1 enchantment.
Circa 1368 DR, these axes were available from Taerom Fuiruim, the smith from the Thunderhammer Smithy in Beregost.
