The Brawling Hands were a pair of gauntlets of dexterity that were believed to have been crafted in the lands of Kara-Tur.
These gauntlets greatly increased the agility of the wearer, assuming they didnt already possess heroic-level reflexes.
There were legends that stated the Brawling Hands were worn a master of the martial arts who brought them to Faer√ªn after a long journey from the Far East.
While it was not exactly known how these magical gauntlets first arrived on the Sword Coast they were seen in the possession of an ogrillon named Hairtooth. The half-orc/ogre regularly extorted travelers at a bridge crossing with his comrade Gnarl during the mid-14 century DR.
