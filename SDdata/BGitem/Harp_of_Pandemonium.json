        "mainbody": "'''''Harps of Pandemonium''''' were [[enchanted]] discordant [[harp]]s, named after the plane of [[Pandemonium]].",
        "Powers": "When the strings of ''harps of Pandemonium'' were plucked, the instrument produced unpalatable disconsolate sounds that affected creatures that could hear the discordant \"music\". Listeners affected by the sounds became ''[[daze]]d'' and ''[[confusion|confused]]''. When a talented [[bard]] played a ''harp of Pandemonium'', they could coalesce the sounds into fields of chaos that reduced the enemies to a band of babbling fools.\n\nEach ''harp of Pandemonium'' held fifty charges, and each use of ether ''daze'' or ''confusion'' musics expended said charges. ''Confusion'' exhausted two charges, while ''daze'' took a single charge.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of these turbulent instruments could be found along the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonsea]] regions.\n\nOne unique ''harp of pandemonium'' once belonged to [[Ravel Puzzlewell]], a notorious [[night hag]] who resided in the planar city of [[Sigil]]. Ravel angered Sigil's god-like entity only known as the [[Lady of Pain]] and was imprisoned within magical maze for eternity. ''Ravel's harp of pandemonium'' was among the hag's [[artifacts]] left behind in Sigil. While it was unknown how ''Ravel's harp'' appeared on [[Toril]], it came into the possession of a merchant named [[Deidre]], a member of [[Aurora's Magic Emporium]], during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|1369}} she began selling her wares in the [[Adventurer Mart]] of [[Athkatla]]."
