The '''''Gift of Peace''''' was a unique [[helmet of defense]] that was found in [[Faerûn]].

==Powers==
It offered significant protection to its wearer, partly in the form of resistance to the elements.

==History==
The exact origin of the ''Gift of Peace'' was unknown, save for that it was once given away as a token of friendship to an [[adventurer]]. It has seen much use throughout its existence and has always been associated as a token of camaraderie.

By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the helm had come into the possession of the [[oni mage]] [[Droth (individual)|Droth]].
