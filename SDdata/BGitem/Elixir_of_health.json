        "mainbody": "Elixirs of health were potions that eliminated negative effects from imbibers without providing actual healing.\nElixirs of health were clear potions of red color with fine bubbly fizz of light wiring inside.\nAn elixir of health cured the drinker from Blindness or deafness, disease, insanity, feeblemind, various infections, and rot. This potion also killed parasites and cured poison in cases where it did not cause damage to the victims body yet. The only thing one had to keep in mind about these potions is that even though they cured various negative conditions, it never healed any damage to the imbibers body, be it a small cut or a gashing wound.\nElixirs of health could be brewed using purified unholy water. Another recipe called for holy water mixed with powdered water opal.\nIn 1281 DR, a unique version of an elixir of health was brewed by and could be purchased from Oswald Fiddlebender, an eccentric gnome inventor and potion-maker. His version of the elixir removed poisons and diseases from the imbiber and gave a much needed physical healing boost which was unique among other variants of the potion.\nIn the 14 century DR, elixirs of health could be encountered in Shadowdale and Freedale.\nClerics of Malar that could be found in the mega-dungeon of Undermountain in the 14 century DR carried an elixir of health as part of their standard equipment.\nIn 1367 DR, magic fountains containing waters enhanced with the elixirs of health could be found in the elven city of Evermeet.\nElixirs of health were common in Ra-Khati of the Hordelands circa 1369 DR.\n*Alustriel Silverhand one of the Chosen of Mystra often carried a vial of an elixir of health.\n*Dandalus Rueee the owner of the Old Xoblob Shop in Waterdeep.\n*Elminster the Sage of Shadowdale carried a blast of an elixir of health on his belt circa 1358 DR.\n*Friar Dugald a cleric and a Knight of Bloodstone.\n*Rukn ud-Din Mahmud a warrior and a guard captain from the Hordelands, active in the mid-14 century DR.\n*Storm Silverhand Alustriel Silverhands sister and another Chosen of Mystra.\n*Thangfod the Mighty a hobgoblin guard captain from Skullport in Undermountain kept a bottle of this elixir in his private chambers circa 1370 DR."
