        "mainbody": "'''''Elixirs of health''''' were [[potion]]s that eliminated negative effects from imbibers without providing actual ''[[heal]]ing''.\n\n{{quote|''All right. Ye are right to ask, and should know. Of what I carry, ye can use only the [[wand]] in my right boot; my belt flask, which contains an elixir of health - ye know, cures disease, poison, an' all that; and the [[ring]]s I wear, which work without any guidance on thy part...''|[[Elminster Aumar]]}}",
        "Description": "''Elixirs of health'' were clear potions of red color with fine bubbly fizz of light wiring inside.",
        "Powers": "An ''elixir of health'' cured the drinker from ''[[Blindness or deafness]]'', ''[[disease]]'', ''[[insanity]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', various ''infections'', and ''rot''. This potion also killed parasites and cured ''poison'' in cases where it did not cause damage to the victim's body yet. The only thing one had to keep in mind about these potions is that even though they cured various negative conditions, it never healed any damage to the imbiber's body, be it a small cut or a gashing wound.",
        "Creation": "''Elixirs of health'' could be brewed using ''purified [[unholy water]]''. Another recipe called for ''[[holy water]]'' mixed with powdered [[water opal]].",
        "Availability": "In [[1281 DR]], a unique version of an ''elixir of health'' was brewed by and could be purchased from [[Oswald Fiddlebender]], an eccentric [[gnome]] inventor and potion-maker. His version of the elixir removed poisons and diseases from the imbiber and gave a much needed physical healing boost which was unique among other variants of the potion.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''elixirs of health'' could be encountered in [[Shadowdale]] and [[Freedale]].\n\n[[Cleric]]s of [[Malar]] that could be found in the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]] in the 14{{th}} century DR carried an ''elixir of health'' as part of their standard equipment.\n\nIn [[1367 DR]], magic fountains containing waters enhanced with the ''elixirs of health'' could be found in the [[elf|elven]] city of [[Evermeet]].\n\n''Elixirs of health'' were common in [[Ra-Khati]] of the [[Hordelands]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Alustriel Silverhand]]: one of the [[Chosen of Mystra]] often carried a vial of an ''elixir of health''.\n*[[Dandalus Rueee]]: the owner of the [[Old Xoblob Shop]] in Waterdeep.\n*[[Elminster]]: the Sage of Shadowdale carried a blast of an ''elixir of health'' on his belt ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].\n*[[Friar Dugald]]: a [[cleric]] and a Knight of Bloodstone.\n*[[Rukn ud-Din Mahmud]]: a [[warrior]] and a guard captain from the Hordelands, active in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.\n*[[Storm Silverhand]]: Alustriel Silverhand's sister and another Chosen of Mystra.\n*[[Thangfod]] the Mighty: a [[hobgoblin]] guard captain from [[Skullport]] in Undermountain kept a bottle of this elixir in his private chambers ''circa'' [[1370 DR]]."
