        "Description": "This shield was forged from [[star metal]].<ref group=\"note\">While the in-game description does not use this term, ''star metal'' refers to \"leftover material from the impact of an object fallen from space\". As such it was exceptionally lightweight, weighing only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).",
        "Powers": "''Sentinel'' possessed a powerful ''+4 enchantment''.",
        "History": "One day during the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]], a comet from [[Realmspace]] landed on [[Toril]] on the [[Sword Coast|coast]] of [[west Faerûn]]. A few days later the blacksmith [[Huffum Fuiruim]] encountered the crash site and gathered the pieces of metal he found. He used them to forge the magical shield called ''Sentinel''.\n\nAt some point during or before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the shield came into the possession of a [[drow]] merchant that operated within the city of [[Ust Natha]]."
