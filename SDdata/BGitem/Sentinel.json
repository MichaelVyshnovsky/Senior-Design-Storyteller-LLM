        "mainbody": "Sentinel was an enchanted medium shield that originated from the Sword Coast.\nThis shield was forged from star metal.While the in-game description does not use this term, star metal refers to \"leftover material from the impact of an object fallen from space\". As such it was exceptionally lightweight, weighing only 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).\nSentinel possessed a powerful +4 enchantment.\nOne day during the mid–13 century DR, a comet from Realmspace landed on Toril on the coast of west Faerûn. A few days later the blacksmith Huffum Fuiruim encountered the crash site and gathered the pieces of metal he found. He used them to forge the magical shield called Sentinel.\nAt some point during or before the , the shield came into the possession of a drow merchant that operated within the city of Ust Natha."
