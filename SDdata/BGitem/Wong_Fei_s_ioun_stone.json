The two battled each other for three days and three nights, and in the end Chan Cheng was so impressed by Wong Fei's skill that he gave him this special ''ioun stone''.\n\nThe stone remained with Wong Fei until he died, then disappeared.\n\nIt resurfaced in the possession of [[Sendai]], a [[drow]] priestess and mage and a [[Bhaalspawn]]. She had it with her in her subterranean drow [[Sendai's enclave|enclave]] beneath [[Amn]] in [[1368 DR]], when [[Gorion's Ward]] confronted her."
