        "History": "The gauntlets were crafted by a mysterious, unnamed man who once encountered Takkok when he was traversing the [[Spine of the World]] mountains. When the man was assaulted by Takkok, he bested the ogre, severed his hands, and used their skin for his new gauntlets.\n\nAt some point before the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], the ''hands'' came into the possession of [[Desreta]] a devout worshiper of the [[primordial]] known as [[entropy]]."
