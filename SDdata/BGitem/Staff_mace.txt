Staff maces were enchanted staves that transformed into hafted maces in battle.
Staff maces were magically designed to help clerics or druids traverse wilderness. They can be used to walk difficult terrains and wielded as maces when dealing with dangerous wildlife.
These weapons radiated a faint aura of transmutation magic. When these staves command word was spoken, they transformed into a mace-like weapon. It possessed a strong +2 enchantment and could be easily wielded by anyone who can use a simple staff.
In the , the elven mage Dradeel kept a staff mace inside his cabin on the Isle of Balduran in the Trackless Sea.
