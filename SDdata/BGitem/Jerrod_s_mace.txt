'''''Jerrod's mace''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] bludgeon from the town of [[Easthaven]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Powers==
The [[mace]] possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that guided the wielder's aim towards the enemy and landed deadlier strikes. It was specifically ensorcelled to be devastating when used against [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s.

==History==
As it's named suggested, ''Jerrod's mace'' once belonged to [[Jerrod]], a historic individual. The [[barbarian]] [[shaman]] of [[Tempus]] wielded his mace against the powerful devil known as [[Belhifet]] ages before the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. The hero sacrificed his life in services of town of [[Easthaven]] in Icewind Dale.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Jerrod's mace'', along with several other magic items from Icewind Dale, ended up in the hands of the merchant named [[Joluv]] who traveled from Icewind Dale to the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], to sell the items to wealthy Amnian adventurers. Joluv peeled his wars from the [[Copper Coronet]] in Athkatla's [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]].
