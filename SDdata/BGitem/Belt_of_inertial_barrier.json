        "mainbody": "A belt of inertial barrier was a powerful magical item that offered significant protection to its wearer.\nWhen worn, the belt surrounded an individual with a pocket of air that was significantly more dense than usual. This barrier shielded the wearer from various types of physical harm.\nSome of these belts even offered protection from projectiles, harmful spells, and other hazards such as the breath weapon of a dragon.\nThe pirate Hoisure the Prudent commissioned a number of these belts be made for his crew.\n* Xithiss, a mindflayer who worked for Baeloth Barrityl in his coliseum the Black Pits."
