'''''Harmonium halberds''''' were [[enchanted]] [[polearm]]s wielded by the members of the [[Harmonium]] from the planar city of [[Sigil]].

==Powers==
''Harmonium halberds'' were enhanced with powerful ''+3'' enchantments that guided the wielder's hands towards the target. Additionally, these enchantments boosted the wielder's strength at the cost of slightly reduced their mental prowess and wisdom.

==History==
''Harmonium halberds'' were entrusted to the most important captains of the Harmonium in Sigil.

While it was unknown how a ''Harmonium halberd'' appeared on [[Toril]], it came into the possession of a merchant named [[Deidre]], a member of [[Aurora's Magic Emporium]], during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|1369}} she began selling her wares in the [[Adventurer Mart]] of [[Athkatla]].
