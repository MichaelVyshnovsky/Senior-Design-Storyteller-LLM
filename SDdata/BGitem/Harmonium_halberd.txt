Harmonium halberds were enhanced with powerful +3 enchantments that guided the wielders hands towards the target. Additionally, these enchantments boosted the wielders strength at the cost of slightly reduced their mental prowess and wisdom.
Harmonium halberds were entrusted to the most important captains of the Harmonium in Sigil.
