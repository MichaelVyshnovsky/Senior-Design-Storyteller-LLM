It was weaved using the finest spider silk and decorated with a large clear aquamarine gemstone.\nThe Gift possessed a variety of enchantments. However, it was unclear if any magic occurred during the amulets creation. Some believed that no arcane manipulations took place and its magic was naught but the reflection of Khalids deep love and affection for his wife.\nSome of the items enchantments increased the wearers natural beauty and charisma, and wisdom. Khalids Gift also imbued Jaheira with vitality, rejuvenating her and making the half-elven woman glow with youth. While Jaheira wore the necklace she could not get fatigued and was protected from being cursed. Additionally, she could cast the spell aid once per day.\nKhalid created the amulet in the , during his and Jaheiras involvement in Caelar Argents crusade against the Dragonspear Castle. With aid from their friend, the famed Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian, Khalid collected the materials for the Gifts creation spider silk from the Forest of Wyrms and a perfect unblemished aquamarine from the Underdark. He surprised Jaheira on their anniversary with the amulet imbued with rejuvenating and protective magic.\nA century after Khalids death, Jaheira, now the High Harper of Baldurs Gate, considered the necklace to be a worthless trinket but also her most prized possession. She kept it secure underneath her home in the Gate, along with other mementos of her younger and more adventurous days."
