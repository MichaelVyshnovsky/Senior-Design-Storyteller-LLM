An '''''oil of fiery burning''''' was a concoction that burst into flames when in contact with air, scorching anyone nearby.

==Description==
These flasks of oil would always break after being thrown, and would ignite immediately. The oils could be used to subject up to six opponents to its effects, such as consuming the bodies of six regenerating [[troll]]s. If these flasks were opened accidentally and not stoppered immediately, the opener would be subject to a deadly explosion.

Oils of fiery burning could be used as [[mage shot]]s.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}

==Creation==
One of the ingredients that could be used for crafting ''oil of fiery burning'' were ashes left behind by a killed [[tome guardian]].
