After agreeing to partake in an archery contest with his rival, Duke Edwall orchestrated the theft of Dead Shot from Duke Raymond.\nOn the day of the contest, Edwall shot the bow at the head of a humanoid target, that in fact had been enchanted at Duke Raymonds behest. Just as the head of the target was torn asunder by the bows arrow, so too did the head of Duke Edwall.\nBy the , Dead Shot came into the possession of a hobgoblin Hakt under the employ of the bandit-leader Tazok."
