        "Description": "The two-handed sword was dark in appearance and \"radiated evil\" from a distance. Circular [[gith language|tir'su]] runes were inscribed across the serrated blade, spelling out its name, meaning \"pain-servant\".",
        "Powers": "The Unholy Reaver made its wielder immune to ''[[charm]]'' spells, but its most powerful feature was a half-chance to [[dispel magic]] on a creature with every strike. Only strong characters could wield such an item.",

            "Legendary history": "Legend has it that Ir'revrykal was forged by the [[githyanki]] [[wizard]]-smith [[Ir'mlar]],<ref group=\"note\">The name of the creator of Ir'revrykal shares similarities with the name of the greatsword itself: \"Ir'mlar\" translates to \"pain-mlar\", a mlar being a githyanki spellcaster who specializes in construction, ''i.e.'', a wizard-smith. Both the ''mlar'' and the ''servant'' are associated with the concept of ''pain''. hundreds of years before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was rumored to have been smithed in the darkened caverns below the city of [[Tu'narath]], an unholy city that floated on the [[Astral Plane]] upon \"the One in the Void\", a long-dead deity.\n\nTo craft the sword, the [[mlar]] used the bones of the One in the Void, an unknown substance to the [[Prime Material plane]]. The wizard-smith then imbued the weapon with an evil entity claimed to be a prince of the lower plane of [[Carceri]]. Some claimed, however, that the greatsword contained the One in the Void's spirit, which had been banished to within the blade for crimes committed against other gods aeons ago.",
            "Later history": "The sword was later relocated to the continent of [[Faer√ªn]], on [[Toril]]. Specifically, the greatsword made its way to a githyanki compound in the [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Amn]], sometime during or before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}."
