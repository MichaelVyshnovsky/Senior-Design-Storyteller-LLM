        "Powers": "The ring protected the wearer with a ''+2 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''.",
        "History": "The ring was buried alongside an ancient, nameless princess of Akanal. Her tomb was eternally protected by an entity referred to only as 'the guard'.\n\nIn the thousands of years that passed following the princesses' death many individuals sought to defeat the guard and raid the royal tomb. Eventually the guard fell and his namesake ring was stolen from the tomb he defended for so long."
