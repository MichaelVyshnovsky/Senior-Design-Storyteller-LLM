A potion of resistance was a type of potion that gave its imbiber resistance to a certain type of damage.
The color and smell of the liquid within these potions varied depending upon the type of damage they gave resistance to.
Potions of fire resistance felt chill to the touch and the insides of the bottles were coated with a layer of frost.
Potions of lightning resistance had liquid that was thick and blue, as well as a smell slightly reminiscent of ozone. Some were packaged within ornate bottles shaped to look as though they were made of clouds. When consumed, they caused the imbiber to experience tingling sensation in their extremities.
Elixirs of necrotic resistance were concoctions that smelled of fresh herbs and berries and had blooming flowed suspended in the vials.
A more powerful variety that granted resistance to all types of magical and mundane damage â€“ elixirs of universal resistance, were a thick concoction that tasted and felt like molten iron. Once consumed, it made the imbiber palpably feel coated in thick protective feel. Vitriol of divine miasma was the main component in this potions creation.
Potions of resistance came in ten different forms (fire, cold, acid, lightning, force, thunder, radiant, necrotic, poison and psychic), such as that which granted resistance to fire was known as a potion of fire resistance. The effect of these potions lasted for an hour.
