        "mainbody": "The Shield of Harmony was an enchanted small shield that offered its wielder significant protection from mind-altering effects.\nWhen held, this shield offered an individual protection from spells and other affects that attempted to charm, befuddle, hold, paralyze, or dominate them, as well as those that tried to make them act erratically or without purpose.\nThe shield of harmony once belonged to the Knight-Champion Audn of the Field, who served the wizard Kekkim.\nAfter being recovered from Kekkims mage tower, it found its way into the hands of a Guildmistress Busya of Trademeet by 1369 DR."
