        "Description": "''Rancor'' was forged from a metal as black as [[ebony]]. It was lined with inscriptions that were not easily understood.\n\nWhen ''Rancor'' was wielded by an individual of [[good|upstanding morality]] it gave them a sense of unease and intense pangs of guilt.",
        "Powers": "''Rancor'' was a [[greatsword]] that possessed a ''+1 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' as well as quite a unique property. Whenever Dorn used the blade to kill someone he wielded it with more skill and accuracy for the next day's time.",
        "History": "For a long time, ''Rancor'' was hidden away in some long-abandoned Banite temple. After months of study and consultation, Dorn learned about its whereabouts and set out with [[Barranca]] to recover it for himself. With some persistence, Dorn removed ''Rancor'' from its resting place and inadvertently triggering a collapse of the temple around him. Fortunately Dorn and sword were not lost for good, thanks to a group of mercenaries who sought out the [[half-orc]] with purpose.\n\nYears later, Dorn carried this sword with him when he sought revenge against those same individuals. but reacquired it before he traveled south to [[Athkatla]]."
