'''''The Iron Thorn''''', also known as the '''''Cursed Ring of Slight Monsterism''''', were ''[[curse]]d'' [[ring]]s that made wearers appear as horrifying decaying [[undead]] creatures.

==Description==
These cursed rings were bands of [[iron]] that looked damaged, as if stained and burned by acid. The band itself was formed to resemble two iron thorns that held a crude lump of [[silver]] in the middle, reminiscent of a white skull on a black background, the symbol of [[Myrkul]], Lord of Bones.

==Powers==
''The Iron Thorn'' was a cursed item that changed the wearer appearance to that of a [[zombie]], drastically reducing their charisma. Apart from the appearance, the ring reduced the wearer's movement speed to that of a shambling undead. Once put on a finger, the ''the Iron Thorn'' could only be removed by a component [[cleric]] or via the ''[[remove curse]]'' spell.

==History==
Several of these rings could be found in the bandit camp of [[Mulahey]] who was instrumental in creating the [[Iron crisis]] of [[1368 DR]]. Another such ring was stashed away in [[Cloak Wood]] forest outside of [[Baldur's Gate]], in the [[Centeol]]'s [[spider]] nest.
