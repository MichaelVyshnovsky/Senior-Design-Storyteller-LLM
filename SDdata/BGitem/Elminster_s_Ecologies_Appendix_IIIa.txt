Elminsters Ecologies Appendix IIIa was an ecology book authored by Elminster Aumar.
Physically, copies of the book were old and time-worn, representing tomes. Elminsters Ecologies Appendix IIIa was part of a larger collection of books, Elminsters Ecologies.
The content of the ecological manual explained rare and strange creatures around the vast continent of Faer√ªn, some of them breeds of existing creatures. Elminster wrote descriptions of such creatures, as well as how to defeat them, if encountered. The following creatures were detailed in the appendix dense puddings, fire trolls, fission slimes, magic golems and mariliths.
Many chests and bookshelves around Watchers Keep kept copies of the guides, as the keep itself teemed with a huge variety of rare creatures.
