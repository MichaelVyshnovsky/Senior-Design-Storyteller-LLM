The '''''Ashen Scales''''' was a suit of [[splint mail]] armor made from the scales of [[wyvern]]s.

==Description==
As its name suggested, the scales of this armor appeared a pale gray in color. They were attached to a [[chain shirt]] using fire that was [[magic]]al in nature. As such it granted the wearer more flexibility than comparable suits of splint mail.

==Powers==
The armor possessed a ''+2 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''.

==History==
[[Usher Skacan]] crafted the ''Ashen Scales'' from the hides of the wyverns that were killing animals in the forest he protected.

Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the armor was stashed inside a chest that lay beneath the [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]] of [[Athkatla]].
