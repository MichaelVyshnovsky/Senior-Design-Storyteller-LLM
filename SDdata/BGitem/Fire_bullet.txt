'''''Fire bullets''''' were an [[enchanted]] variety of [[sling]] [[bullet]]s that were carved from the knucklebones of [[salamander]]s.

==Powers==
When launched, ''fire bullets'' whizzed through the air, igniting with flames of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], dealing bludgeoning and searing damage to their targets.

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], many enchanted sling bullets were a common sight along the [[Sword Coast]], the [[Moonsea]], and used by numerous individuals and factions. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Zhentarim]]-sponsored smugglers that served [[Gorgomorz]], the [[Devil]] of [[Daggerford]], supplied the fiend's army of [[orc]]s and [[tanarukk]]a with arms, weapons, and other supplies, including enchanted ''fire bullets''.
