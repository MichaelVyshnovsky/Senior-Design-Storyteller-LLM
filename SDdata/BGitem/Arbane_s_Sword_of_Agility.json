        "mainbody": "'''''Arbane's swords of agility''''' were a set of [[artifact]]s originally crafted by the [[wizard]] [[Arbane]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. At least a dozen of these [[longsword]]s were forged by Arbane or others before the secret of its manufacture was lost to history.",
        "Powers": "The ''sword of agility'' always appeared as a ''+2 [[longsword]]'', although the enchantments varied depending on the individual blade.\n\nOne variety was known to glow brightly, negating any effects of [[magic]]al [[darkness]]. It dispelled the effects of both ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'' and ''[[fire charms]]'', granted protection from the [[spell]] ''[[color spray]]'' as well as immunity to ''[[hold person|hold]]'' and ''[[slow]]'' spells. Furthermore it allowed the wielder to cast the spell ''[[jump]]'' or a limited-duration ''[[haste]]'' on themself, once a day.{{Cite dragon/41/Bazaar of the Bizarre}}\n\nYet a different version was ''[[longsword of speed]]'' that granted the wielder continuous ''[[freedom of movement]]'' and immunity to [[illusion]] spells and magical effects. Like its counterpart, it also gave the ability to cast [[jump]], as well as ''[[daylight]]'', in place of the other blade's inherent glow, to dispel darkness once a day.",
        "Owners": "One of the ''swords of agility'' once came to the possession of an outlaw named [[Garno]], who slayed a great many [[cleric]]s of various denominations following his religious disillusionment at the hands of the [[church of Loviatar]], and their brutal slaying of his family. Rumors divine intervention surrounded these slayings, as it was said one of the [[deities]] of chaos had a had in his acquisition of the weapon as well as much delight in the mayhem he caused."
