Harps of Pandemonium were enchanted discordant harps, named after the plane of Pandemonium.
When the strings of harps of Pandemonium were plucked, the instrument produced unpalatable disconsolate sounds that affected creatures that could hear the discordant "music". Listeners affected by the sounds became dazed and confused. When a talented bard played a harp of Pandemonium, they could coalesce the sounds into fields of chaos that reduced the enemies to a band of babbling fools.
Each harp of Pandemonium held fifty charges, and each use of ether daze or confusion musics expended said charges. Confusion exhausted two charges, while daze took a single charge.
In the late 14 century DR, several of these turbulent instruments could be found along the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions.
One unique harp of pandemonium once belonged to Ravel Puzzlewell, a notorious night hag who resided in the planar city of Sigil. Ravel angered Sigils god-like entity only known as the Lady of Pain and was imprisoned within magical maze for eternity. Ravels harp of pandemonium was among the hags artifacts left behind in Sigil. While it was unknown how Ravels harp appeared on Toril, it came into the possession of a merchant named Deidre, a member of Auroras Magic Emporium, during the 14 century DR. Sometime prior to the  she began selling her wares in the Adventurer Mart of Athkatla.
