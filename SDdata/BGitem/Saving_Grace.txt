'''''Saving Grace''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[shield]] that was long associated with the followers of [[Bane]].

==Powers==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the shield possessed a ''+3 enchantment''.

==History==
While ''Saving Grace'' was once a very powerful shield its powers waned following the death of Bane during the [[Time of Troubles]].

At some over the next decade, the shield found its way to the abandoned [[Temple of Amaunator (Athkatla)|temple]] of [[Amaunator]] located beneath the city of [[Athkatla]].
