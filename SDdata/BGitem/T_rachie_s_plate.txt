'''''T'rachie's plate''''' was a set of [[curse]]d [[plate mail]] [[armor]] that was crafted by the covetous [[T'rachie|Baron T'rachie]].

==Powers==
This armor possessed a powerful ''+5 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' but conferred a number of detriments to its wearer. When someone donned ''T'rachie's plate'', they became much more frail and repellent to others they encountered.

==History==
The namesake armor of the elder Baron T'rachie, this armor was crafted at a time when the nobleman greatly desired the wife of one of his soldiers, [[Libol]]. T'rachie crafted the cursed plate mail and offered it to Libol as a gift. The married soldier could not remove the armor, due to its curse, and became horribly disfigured by its [[magic]]al effects. The baron then reassigned Libol to a distant wasteland somewhere in the Realms in a campaign that saw constant battle against a band of marauding [[ogre]]s.

Sometime following these events, ''T'rachie's plate'' appeared for sale within the [[Adventurer Mart]], in the city of [[Athkatla]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
