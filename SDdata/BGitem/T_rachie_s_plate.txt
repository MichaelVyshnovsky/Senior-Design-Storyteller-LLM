Trachies plate was a set of cursed plate mail armor that was crafted by the covetous Baron Trachie.
This armor possessed a powerful +5 enchantment but conferred a number of detriments to its wearer. When someone donned Trachies plate, they became much more frail and repellent to others they encountered.
The namesake armor of the elder Baron Trachie, this armor was crafted at a time when the nobleman greatly desired the wife of one of his soldiers, Libol. Trachie crafted the cursed plate mail and offered it to Libol as a gift. The married soldier could not remove the armor, due to its curse, and became horribly disfigured by its magical effects. The baron then reassigned Libol to a distant wasteland somewhere in the Realms in a campaign that saw constant battle against a band of marauding ogres.
Sometime following these events, Trachies plate appeared for sale within the Adventurer Mart, in the city of Athkatla, during the midâ€“14 century DR.
