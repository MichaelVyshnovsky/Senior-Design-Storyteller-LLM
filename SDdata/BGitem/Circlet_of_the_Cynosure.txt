The '''''Circlet of the Cynosure''''' was a [[magic]]al [[circlet]] associated with the faith of [[Lathander]].

==Powers==
When worn, the circlet bestowed upon an individual a bolstered sense of bravery, making them immune to the effects of fear in battle. Their mind and their body were similarly guarded, nullifying the effects of any [[charm]] magical or forms of paralysis.

==History==
The ''Circlet of the Cynosure'' was originally commissioned by [[Edythe Brightsworn]] some time during the mid–to–late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. She had it made in order to battle a particular [[vampire]] that laired within the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] in [[Waterdeep]]. While Lady Edythe did not survive the foray into the tunnels beneath the city's graveyard, the circlet was brought out by the expedition's only surviving member.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Caelar Argent]], a former member of the [[Order of the Aster]] that rallied the [[Shining Crusade]] across the [[Sword Coast]].
