/+6 Holy Avenger
Carsomyr was a powerful two-handed holy avenger sword found in Firkraags "hoard" in his subterranean lair within the realm of Amn.
Described as one of the most powerful weapons existing on Faerûn, the blade was technically a +5 two-handed sword (greatsword) that granted magic resistance when wielded.
This powerful sword could be used to cast dispel magic. Carsomyr was extremely devastating to chaotic evil opponents and also dispelled their magic whenever it hit.
