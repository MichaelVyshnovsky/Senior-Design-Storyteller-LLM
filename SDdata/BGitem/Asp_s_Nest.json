        "mainbody": "sps Nest was a type of an enchanted poisoned dart that was used by members of shadowy organizations such as Shadow Thieves and Xanathars Thieves Guild.\nAsps Nest darts tips were covered in rows of fangs that delivered poison upon hit in a similar manner to how venom was injected by a snakes bite. These darts possessed a +1 magical enchantment, and the poison inside typically was affecting the targets constitution.\nGenerally speaking, Asps Nests name was given to multiple different, but similar in design and effect darts.\nSome theorized that these darts originated from Reghedmen or Uthgardt of the north.\nA version of the Asps Nest was created by Fargon Fol of Shadow Thieves. She spent all of her time collecting copious amounts of poisonous snakes and transforming them into the darts with the magic. Her version of the Asps Nest darts turned back into snakes upon hit, injecting the victim with its venom.\nIn 1368 DR, Asps Nest darts were in Shadow Thieves arsenal.\nIn 1369 DR, these darts were available to purchase from Ribald Barterman in Athkatlas Temple District.\nIn 1372 DR, a member of Xanathars Thieves Guild, Nakoto along with her fellow thieves, were armed with these darts, while dealing with Matagar Bugo of Daggerford.\n*Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn\n*Baldurs Gate Siege of Dragonspear\n*Neverwinter Nights Darkness over Daggerford\nCategoryDarts\nCategoryRanged weapons\nCategoryThrown weapons\nCategorySimple weapons\nCategoryWeapons\nCategoryItems\nCategory150-199 gold pieces\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryMagic weapons\nje9wog79c9c2l9suvr19zoymx9erv50"
