'''''Spider's Bane''''' was a [[magic]]al [[greatsword]].

==Powers==
In addition to being a powerfully enchanted blade, ''Spider's Bane'' also protected its wielder from effects that affected movement, such as the [[spell]] ''[[web]]''.

==History==
''Spider's Bane'' was crafted by [[Dwarf|dwarves]] from [[Clan Orothiar]], based out of the [[Cloakwood]]. The greatsword was gifted to the [[Council of Four]], the ruling body of [[Baldur's Gate]], for the purpose of fostering goodwill between the two organizations. The Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate wielded ''Spider's Bane'' for a century, but it was eventually lost in a fight againt [[ettercap]]s and spiders.

In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], [[Chelak]] and his brother [[Tiber]] found ''Spider's Bane''. Aware of the sword's powers, and seeking fame and fortune, they sought to clear out a  [[giant spider]] colony in the Cloakwood. Chelak went into the colony alone, where he ended up killed by spiders. Tiber, distraught at his brother's disappearance, lingered in the forest for over a week, seeking adventurers who could find Chelak for him. He eventually encountered [[Gorion's Ward]], who returned Chelak's body to Tiber. Overcome with grief, Chelak gave ''Spider's Bane'' to the Ward.
