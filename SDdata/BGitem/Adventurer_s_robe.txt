An '''''adventurer's robe''''' was a type of magical garment worn by those [[arcane spellcaster]]s who traveled across the Realms.

==Powers==
These robes offered a spellcaster greater protection than mundane clothing.

One variety of of ''adventurer's robes'' crafted circa the {{yearlinkName|1368}} protected its wearer from blunt-trauma weapons. It offered further protection against [[polymorph]]ic magic and ''petrification'' effects, such as that caused by the gaze of a [[basilisk]].

Yet another type of ''adventurer's robes'' merely mitigated any physical harm that was inflicted upon the wearer.
