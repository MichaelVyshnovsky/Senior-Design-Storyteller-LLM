The Amplifier, or similar to it amulets of metaspell influence, were enchanted amulets that boosted the wearers magical gifts.
The Amplifier and similar amulets of metaspell influence possessed enchantments that enhanced the wearers arcane spellcasting abilities, expanding their minds, allowing for additional spells of a lower complexity to be memorized per day.
The original Amplifier was created by Elairdrin Mellwith of the Star Mountains long before the late 14 century DR. Elairdrins motivations were far from scholarly. He used his Amplifier to aid his womanizing habits. Sometime later, the original Amplifier was claimed from Elairdrin by a wizard who planned to use the amulet to harness his destructive magics. How the item was claimed remained unclear as historic accounts of that event varied wildly.
By the late 14 century DR,  amulets of metaspell influence became highly sought after by mages of all walks of life.
* Jon Irenicus, one of these amulets belongs to the archmage and stored in his dungeon underneath the cit of Athkatla in the late 14 century DR.
* Ramazith, a mage from the Northern Baldurs Gate who enslaved nymph Abela in the late 14 century DR.
* Xithiss, a mind flayer magic item vendor who served Baeloth Barrityl in his Black Pits in the 14 century DR.
