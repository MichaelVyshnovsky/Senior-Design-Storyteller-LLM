        "mainbody": "The '''''battle axe of Mauletar''''' was an enchanted [[axe]] once wielded by the guardsman named [[Mauletar]] during the [[Thay]]an civil war of [[1074 DR]].",
        "Powers": "This golden-colored [[silver]]ed [[battle axe]] possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that guided the wielder's arm towards the target and dealt increased damage.",
        "History": "The enchanted axe belonged to House [[Ormynd]] of Thay. In the {{YearlinkName|1074}}, the people of Thay rose against oppressive [[Zulkir]]ate and started a short but bloody civil war. Members of House Ormynd fled the [[Red Wizard]]â€“-ruled nation when they were betrayed. The family friend and bodyguard, Mauletar, picked up the axe and sacrificed his life, allowing the family to escape. Since then, the ''battle axe of Mauletar'' became a symbol of loyalty and devoted friendship. With time, many copies of the weapon were created and wielded to uphold the virtues of their namesake.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, several ''battle axes of Mauletar'' ended up on the [[Sword Coast]]. A member of the [[Band of Merry Fools]] wielded one such axe while in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Another axe ended up within the ''[[Planar Sphere]]'' of [[Lavok Corthala]] that crash-landed in [[Athkatla]]. Lastly. a weapon merchant [[Magda (Black Pits)|Magda]] of the [[Black Pits]] had a copy of the ''battle axe of Mauletar'' available for sale."
