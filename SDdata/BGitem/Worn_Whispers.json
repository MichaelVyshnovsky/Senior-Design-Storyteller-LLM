        "mainbody": "Worn Whispers were a specific variety of boots of stealth that originated from the kingdom of Cormyr.\nThese boots allowed the wearer to move more silently and hide with greater ease.\nThese boots were worn by the royal spies of King Rhigaerd II, who ruled Cormyr during the late 13 and early 14 centuries DR.The item description given in Baldurs Gate doesnt specify whether the king in question was Rhiigard Obarskyr (sometimes spelled \"Rhiegard\") or Rhigaerd Obarskyr II. Due to the inconsistent spelling of Rhiigard, this article assumes Rhigaerd II had the boots commissioned. The spies were renowned throughout the kingdom and beyond for their tremendous skill in their craft. Eventually the order of spies were betrayed from within, and the tools of their trade, including numerous pairs of these boots were dispersed across the Realms.\nOne such pair of magic boots was worn by Purvis, the assassin who was hired by the speaker of Lonelywood in the .\nOne set of worn whispers came into the possession of the thief Zhurlong sometime before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR. He then proceeded to lose them to some hobgoblins just south of Beregost.\nAnother pair had been recovered by one of the guildmasters of the Shadow Thieves, MaeVar of Athkatla.\nYet another pair were claimed by Samuel Thunderburp a bartender who also resided within Athkatla."
