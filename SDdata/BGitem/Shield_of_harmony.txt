The '''''Shield of Harmony''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[small shield]] that offered its wielder significant protection from mind-altering effects.

==Powers==
When held, this [[shield]] offered an individual protection from spells and other affects that attempted to [[charm]], [[Confusion|befuddle]], [[Hold person|hold]], [[paralyze]], or [[Dominate person|dominate]] them, as well as those that tried to [[Chaos (spell)|make them act erratically]] or [[rigid thinking|without purpose]].

==History==
The ''shield of harmony'' once belonged to the Knight-Champion [[Audn|Audn of the Field]], who served the [[wizard]] [[Kekkim]].

After being recovered from Kekkim's mage tower, it found its way into the hands of a [[Busya|Guildmistress Busya]] of [[Trademeet]] by [[1369 DR]].
