Rancor was a legendary Banite greatsword that was taken as the personal weapon of the blackguard Dorn Il-Khan.
Rancor was forged from a metal as black as ebony. It was lined with inscriptions that were not easily understood.
When Rancor was wielded by an individual of upstanding morality it gave them a sense of unease and intense pangs of guilt.
Rancor was a greatsword that possessed a +1 enchantment as well as quite a unique property. Whenever Dorn used the blade to kill someone he wielded it with more skill and accuracy for the next days time.
For a long time, Rancor was hidden away in some long-abandoned Banite temple. After months of study and consultation, Dorn learned about its whereabouts and set out with Barranca to recover it for himself. With some persistence, Dorn removed Rancor from its resting place and inadvertently triggering a collapse of the temple around him. Fortunately Dorn and sword were not lost for good, thanks to a group of mercenaries who sought out the half-orc with purpose.
Years later, Dorn carried this sword with him when he sought revenge against those same individuals. but reacquired it before he traveled south to Athkatla.
