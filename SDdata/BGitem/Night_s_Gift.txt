The Nights Gift was a heavily enchanted suit of leather armor that had been blessed by the deity Shar.
Dark in appearance, an "essence of night" had been woven into the armor, enveloping the wearer in a mass of shadows.
The armor greatly improved the stealth abilities of anyone who wore it, allowing them to blend in with shadows with significant ease. However, whomever donned the Nights Gift was completely incapable of casting arcane magic.
The Nights Gift had a long and storied history throughout the Realms. It had been worn by only the most skilled and greatest thieves of Toril.
Somehow the armor came into the possession of Minister Lloyd of Imnesvale sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR.
