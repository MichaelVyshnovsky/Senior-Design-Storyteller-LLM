        "mainbody": "The '''''Doomplate''''' was a set of [[plate mail]] that had been worn by many adventurers throughout its existence on [[Faerûn]]. Everyone one of its owners died not long after they first donned the suit of [[armor]]. It earned its grim moniker from [[Adarius Shin]], the first soul unfortunate enough to wear the ''Doomplate'', who quickly met an untimely end.\n\nDespite the unfortunate fates of its owners, the ''Doomplate'' possessed a ''+3 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' and offered extra protection against bladed and slashing weapons."
