        "mainbody": "The Doomplate was a set of plate mail that had been worn by many adventurers throughout its existence on Faer√ªn. Everyone one of its owners died not long after they first donned the suit of armor. It earned its grim moniker from Adarius Shin, the first soul unfortunate enough to wear the Doomplate, who quickly met an untimely end.\nDespite the unfortunate fates of its owners, the Doomplate possessed a +3 enchantment and offered extra protection against bladed and slashing weapons."
