'''''Greenstone amulets''''' were rare, extremely valuable [[magic]]al necklaces that offered protection against a wide range of mind-controlling and physically dominating [[spell]]s. They appeared as fist-sized stones, made of brittle that shone with a radiance when activated.

==Powers==
When worn against the skin, these amulets provided a continuous ''[[mind blank]]'' spell and shielded its wearer with a ''[[spell immunity]]''-like affect, which granted absolute protection from the spells ''[[Chaos (spell)|chaos]]'',  ''[[geas]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[mass charm]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[quest]]'' , ''[[score]]'', and ''[[sleep]]''. It also offered more-limited protection against ''[[fumble]]'', ''[[maze]]'', ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', and ''[[trip]]'', as well as [[necromantic]] spells, [[dimension]]al transportation, and certain [[psionic]] abilities.

Greenstone amulets could only protect the wearer from a certain number and intensity of spells before it was completely drained, after which it shone extremely brightly and then slowly faded to a dark hue. It would slowly recharge after this occurrence.{{Cite dragon/39/Bazaar of the Bizarre}}
