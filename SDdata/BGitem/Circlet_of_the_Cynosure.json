        "mainbody": "The Circlet of the Cynosure was a magical circlet associated with the faith of Lathander.\nWhen worn, the circlet bestowed upon an individual a bolstered sense of bravery, making them immune to the effects of fear in battle. Their mind and their body were similarly guarded, nullifying the effects of any charm magical or forms of paralysis.\nThe Circlet of the Cynosure was originally commissioned by Edythe Brightsworn some time during the mid–to–late 13 century DR. She had it made in order to battle a particular vampire that laired within the City of the Dead in Waterdeep. While Lady Edythe did not survive the foray into the tunnels beneath the citys graveyard, the circlet was brought out by the expeditions only surviving member.\n* Caelar Argent, a former member of the Order of the Aster that rallied the Shining Crusade across the Sword Coast."
