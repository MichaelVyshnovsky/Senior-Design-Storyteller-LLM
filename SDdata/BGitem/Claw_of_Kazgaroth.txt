The '''''Claw of Kazgaroth''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] that could be used as a [[magic]]al [[ring]].

==Description==
The artifact, which was [[curse|cursed]], had multiple enchantments. The curse effect lowered the wielder's vigor and fed off their blood, but provided them with numerous benefits. The image of the wielder would become blurry and thus far more difficult to hit. Unlike most other items that provided protection, the claw made it easier to avoid attacks from [[weapon]]s, missiles, and even effects from [[wand]]s. As well as standard [[spell]] effects, the wearer could resist [[polymorph]]ing and [[breath]] attacks.

Due to the claw's curse, the wearer would become sick more often and was prone to the effects of [[poison]]. It could only be removed with the ''[[remove curse]]'' spell.

==History==
The claw was once part of [[Kazgaroth]], a powerful beast and [[aspect]] of [[Malar]], which took the natural form of a [[tyrannosaurus]]. After the [[evil]] beast fell, the claw was extracted from its corpse. It is unknown how, but the artifact ended up in [[High Hedge]], [[Beregost]], where it was listed for sale at a very high price, amongst other magical items.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Thalantyr]], a powerful [[conjurer]] who sold various magical wares, including the claw.
