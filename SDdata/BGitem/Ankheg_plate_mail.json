        "mainbody": "Ankheg plate mail was a type of chitin armor, a suit of armor crafted from the chitinous shell of an ankheg. Despite its name, it was not true plate mail but rather offered its wearer similar protection in combat and could be worn by druids.\nThis armor was highly valued for its lightness, as it weighed significantly less than metal plate armor. As such it cost anywhere from 4,000 - 6,000 gp and took between one to three days to be made.\n* Cromwell of Athkatla\n* Taerom Fuiruim of the Thunderhammer Smithy in Beregost"
