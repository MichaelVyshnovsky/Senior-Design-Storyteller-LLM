The '''''mana bow''''' was a [[magic]]al [[longbow]] whose earliest known whereabouts originated in the city of [[Athkatla]] within the country of [[Amn]]. It possessed a strong [[Item enchantment|enchantment]] that protected its wielder from [[arcane]] [[spell]]s and effects.

==History==
While its exact origins were unknown, the ''mana bow'' was once in the possession of the [[Cowled Wizards]] of Athkatla. At one point, it was gifted to the vigilant guardsman [[Kestsa]], who was exceptionally adept at apprehending rogue [[spellcaster]]s within the City of Coin. It served him well in his duties for quite some time.

By [[1369 DR]], the longbow had made its way to the [[Forest of Tethir]], just a bit outside the [[elven]] city of [[Suldanessellar]].
