The Human Flesh was a unique gruesome set of enchanted leather armor created by the agents of the Twisted Rune and this serial killer ally in the late 14 century DR.
The initial set was poorly sewn pieces of human hide gathered from the serial killers victims. When it was treated with a certain breed of dragons blood, its leather hardened, and the armor emitted a stench of bitter death.
Initially sewn together, the Human Flesh was nothing but a minor +1 enchanted leather set that made the wearer vulnerable to piercing and missile attacks. However, once completed, it became a powerful magical +5 armor, extremely useful against piercing and missile damage. It also offered significant resistance to magic and allowed the wearer to move silently with staggering efficiency.
In the , an agent of the Twisted Rune, Darcin Cole of Imnesvale, was ordered to contact "skinner" serial killer Rejiek Hidesman, commissioning his murder of a number of Athkatlans. The victims were skinned, and their skin was used in sewing together a crude set of armor. However, it was far from complete. Darcin Cole needed to finish the commission. For completion, he needed silver dragon blood and a long four-day process of treatment of the foul magic item. It was unknown if and how the Human Flesh was completed and what dragon lost its life on behest of the Twisted Rune.
