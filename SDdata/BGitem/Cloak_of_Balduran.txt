The cloak of Balduran was an magical cloak that was worn by the famous explorer, and city-founder Balduran.
The cloak provided the wearer with significant protections, even shielding them from magical spells and spell-like abilities.
Sometime around the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Baldurans cloak and helm were recovered by the elven adventurer Vail who was subsequently turned to stone by the Baldurian wizard Ramazith Flamesinger. However, before Vail and his companions were petrified and sold to the art collector Felonius Gist, the adventure hid the helmet and gave the cloak away to the courtesan Quenash.
