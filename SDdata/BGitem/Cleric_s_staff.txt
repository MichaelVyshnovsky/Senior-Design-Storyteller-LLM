'''''Cleric's staves''''' were [[enchanted]] [[staves]] crafted and ensorcelled to be used by [[cleric]]s.

==Powers==
These staves were simple weapons that radiated powerful magic. Their simple design suggested the staves were created to be used by modest priests or clerics. ''Cleric's staves'' were enchanted with a potent ''+3'' enchantment that made the staff a deadly weapon and guided the wielder's hand towards the target.
