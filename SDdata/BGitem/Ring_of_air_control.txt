'''''Rings of air control''''' were [[enchanted]] sky-blue [[ring]]s that allowed the wearer to ''[[charm]]'' [[air elemental]]s.

==Powers==
The main magic contained within these rings allowed to ''charm air elemental'' through a mere touch once per day. Additionally, the wearer could tap into its ''[[greater invisibility]]'' powers once per day.

==History==
''Rings of air control'' were surrounded by grim tales of [[Red Wizards of Thay]] wielding them as weapons against small villages. These attacks were said to had come out of nowhere, leaving no survivors and attackers left without a trace. These tales were dubious but warned people of the dangerous power of such rings.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a ''ring of air control'' could be found among enchanted goods peddled by [[Ribald Barterman]] in the [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]]'s [[Waukeen's Promenade]].
