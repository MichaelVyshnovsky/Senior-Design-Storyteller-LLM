Crimson chain was a type of enchanted chainmail armor that originated from the nation of Amn.
The links of the mail were crafted from a type of red-hued metal that was found beneath the Cloud Peaks mountain range.
Members of the Bloodway adventuring company all worse suits of crimson chain.
Most of the armor was lost over time, but one suit found its way into the possession of Ribald Barterman, who ran the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla.
