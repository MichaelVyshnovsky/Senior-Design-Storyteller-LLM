The shield of the falling stars was a magical tower shield that had been blessed by the deity Ilmater.
This shield offered great protection against non-magical missiles such as arrows, crossbow bolts or other similar projectiles.
The shield of falling stars was once carried by a young squire who went through heroic lengths to ensure the safety and well-being of his steed. In the middle of a great battle with a horde of hobgoblins, the young man was sent to call for reinforcements for the cavalry division that had been overwhelmed. When he saw that the sun had been blocked from the sky by scores of arrows that would soon fall upon himself and his mount, he lifted his shield and threw his body in front of the cascade of projectiles.
Seeing this selfless-act, Ilmater blessed the young mans shield, protecting his steed and ensuring his sacrifice was not in vain.
While the squire died from his wounds, his horse continued the trip unharmed, carrying his body to their military superiors and signaling the mounted warriors needs for aide on the battlefield. The brave young mans was carried off to the nearest town and he was resurrected for his valorous deeds.
At some point during the mid-14 century DR, the shield came into the possession of Tremain Beldear.
