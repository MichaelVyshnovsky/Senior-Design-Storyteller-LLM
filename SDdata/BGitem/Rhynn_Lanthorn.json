        "History": "When [[Irenicus]] was attacking Suldanessellar, he hid its entrance with illusions to prevent [[Elhan]] and his troops from entering. The Lanthorn was capable of seeing through the illusions, so he had [[Bodhi]] steal it and hide it in [[Athkatla]]. Only when it was recovered were the elves able to get back into the city.<ref><ref>"
