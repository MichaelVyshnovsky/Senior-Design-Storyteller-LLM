The '''''One Gift Lost''''' was a unique ''[[necklace of missiles]]'' that was present in [[Faerûn]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Like others of its kind, this necklace allowed the wearer to launch a massive explosive blast that resembled a ''[[fireball]]''.

==History==
This necklace was originally owned by [[Ikaida Mourneve]]. It was gifted to Ikaida by a kindly [[mage]] during his journey to recover his abducted daughter. At some point, Ikaida dropped the ''One Gift Lost'' into the [[Immerflow]] river.

By the mid–14{{th}} century DR, several copies of this necklace existed. One could be purchased at the carnival in [[Nashkel]] in [[1368 DR]]. The same year, nother copy was sold in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] by a jewelry merchant staying at the [[Elfsong Tavern]]. and one more, in the merchant stalls of [[Trademeet]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Delorna]]: one of the daughters of [[Shandalar]] who loved in Baldur's Gate ''circa'' 1368 DR.
*[[Nadine]]: a [[halfling]] woman from Baldur's Gate who offered the necklace as a reward for delivering an ''[[amulet of protection]]'' to her wayward son in 1368 DR.
*[[Safana]]: a [[thief]] and one of the companions of [[Abdel Adrian]] in 1368 DR.
*[[Xithiss]]: a [[mind flayer]] trader under [[Baeloth Barrityl]]'s control from the [[Black Pits]] of [[Underdark]].
