        "mainbody": "The Spear of the Unicorn was an elegantly designed magical spear. The head of the weapon was carved in the shape of a unicorns horn. Whether or not it was forged, crafted, or an actual horn from the magical beast was unknown.\nThe wielder of the enchanted spear was immune to hold and charm spells. It also possessed a potent +3 enchantment that guided the wielders hands forwards the target and enhanced the damage done. Additionally, the spears wielder had a higher chance of surviving magics that could instantly end their life.\nIn 1369 DR, the Unicorn Spear was found in a troll den near the cottage of the witch Adratha, outside the city of Trademeet."
