        "mainbody": "Salve of senile serenity, also known as Teodgrens salve of senile serenity, was a magic potion that could temporarily elevate the mind-affecting symptoms of dementia in elderly sentient creatures.\nThe salve was pleasant-tasting and it immediately cleared the fog from the mind of a creature affected by dementia.\nIn 1369 DR, Teodgrens salve of senile serenity were mixed and sold by Bellowgulp Bluefingers and the Concocter during their time in Dennatons gladiatorial pits of Thay. The salve, which apparently was also effective when ingested, was used by a drow wizard Gezzthemin on the rarely lucid elderly wizard Dulf Ebonbeard. Thanks to the old mans temporarily invigorated mind, the two helped the Champion of Baeloths Pit to plan the escape and ways to cripple the Red Wizards Planar Hunters."
