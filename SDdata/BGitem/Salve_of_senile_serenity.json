The salve, which apparently was also effective when ingested, was used by a [[drow]] [[wizard]] Gezzthemin on the rarely lucid elderly wizard [[Dulf Ebonbeard]]. Thanks to the old man's temporarily invigorated mind, the two helped the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pit]] to plan the escape and ways to cripple the [[Red Wizard]]'s [[Planar Hunters]]."
