A '''''ring of animal influence''''', also known as a '''''ring of animal friendship''''', was a [[magic item|magical]] [[ring]] that allowed its wearer to communicate with and influence the behavior of [[animal]]s.

==Appearance==
''Rings of animal influence'' created by the druids of High Forest were crafted out of magically preserved green brambles and twigs. These rings smelled of edible berries.

==Powers==
Each use of the ring allowed its wearer to cast the ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[fear]]'', or ''[[speak with animals]]'' [[spell]]s, any of which could only target [[beast]]s. The ring could be used in this way up to three times, after which it gradually recovered its magic over successive dawns. Pre-[[Spellplague]] versions only contained ''animal frienship'', which could be used at will.

==History==
It was said that the secret of creating ''rings of animal influence'' was kept guarded by the [[druid]]s of [[Cormanthor]]. In mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]] very few of these rings were seen outside of druidic orders, although some have been sold by exiled and fallen members and looted of the druids' bodies.

By the late 14{{th}} century, more ''ring of animal influence'' could be seen outside of the druids' circles. The rings that originated from the [[High Forest]] could be found across the [[Sword Coast]] and were imbued with divine magic of [[Mielikki]] and [[Silvanus]].
