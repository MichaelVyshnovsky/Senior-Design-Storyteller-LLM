        "mainbody": "A potion of giant strength was a type of concoction that modified the imbibers raw physical power to that of a certain kind of giant.\nThe liquid of these types of potions was transparent and contained a fingernail of the specific giant. They varied in rarity from uncommon to legendary, which scaled with the power of the giant. Potions of giant strength were sold across Faer√ªn.\nPotions of giant strength had a sliver of hill giants toe nail floating in the vials. The liquid itself had a fetid smell, making it hard to swallow.\nThe imbiber had an increased chance to hit opponents, as well as do more damage with thrown or melee weapons. The types of potions available modified the users strength from their own to that of a hill giant, frost giant/stone giant, fire giant, cloud giant, a storm giant, or even a reef giant.\nPlaces and individuals in the Realms one could purchase potions of giant strength from included the following establishments\n*Sorcerous Sundries in Baldurs Gate sold all varieties of this potion.\n*Aasim owned a potion of stone giant strength.\n*Auntie Ethel, a green hag trader of potions, lotions, quirks, and sundries from the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR.\n*Brage owned a potion of stone giant strength.\n*Derryth Bonecloak, a beardless dwarven potion merchant from Bonecloaks Apothecary in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nAccording to some rumors, if one were to substitute a part from an undead hill giant in place of a living one, it would cause the resulting potion of hill giant strength to have the additional effect of granting an imbiber the barrowes energy-draining attack."
