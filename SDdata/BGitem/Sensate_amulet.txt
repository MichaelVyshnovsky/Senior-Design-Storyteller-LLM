A '''''Sensate amulet''''' was a powerful [[amulet]] associated with the [[Society of Sensation]], one of the major power factions in the [[Outer Planes]] city of [[Sigil]].

==Description==
These amulets were offered as gifts to Sensates that demonstrated complete and total loyalty to their organization.

==Powers==
A ''Sensate amulet'' was designed to offered significant boons to any Sensate traveling the [[planes of existence|planes]] looking for new and exciting experiences. It bolstered their inherent vitality and ''[[Protection from evil|guarded them from malevolent forces]]''.

Additionally, it granted the wearer increased aura of personality, allowing them to more easily make friends and influence others.

She later appeared in the regular release of ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition]]''. who specialized in extra-planar items and operated out of the [[Adventurer Mart]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]], and the enslaved [[mind flayer]] [[Xithiss]] within the [[Black Pits]].
