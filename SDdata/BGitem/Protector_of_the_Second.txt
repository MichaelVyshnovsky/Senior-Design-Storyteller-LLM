The '''''Protector of the Second''''' was a suit of [[leather armor]] that was crafted for, as well as named after, the [[elven]] [[ranger]] [[Indeera Lakhan]].

==Powers==
The ''Protector'' possessed a ''+2 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''.

==History==
Indeera Lakhan was the second-in-command leader of the [[Mist of Shadows]], an elite squad of elven rangers that hailed from the forests of [[Cormanthor]]. While it was unknown how the armor was seperated from its owner, it came into the possession of the [[assassin]] [[Maneira (Sword Coast)|Maneira]] some time before the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]].
