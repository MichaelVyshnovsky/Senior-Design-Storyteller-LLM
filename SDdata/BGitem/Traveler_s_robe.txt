A '''''traveler's robe''''' was a type of garment favored by those [[arcane spellcaster]]s who lived transient lives, moving from one settlement to another.

==Powers==
This type of robe offered its wearer protection against weapons that pierced the flesh, such as [[arrow]]s and [[dagger]]s. It also offered them an extra breath of life when threatened by billowing clouds of noxious gas.
