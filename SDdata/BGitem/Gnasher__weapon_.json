        "mainbody": "Gnasher was an enchanted club created by the druid only known as Makal of the Pine some years before the late 14 century DR.\nGnasher possessed a +2 enchantment that increased the weapons damage and improved the wielders aim. Additionally, its sharp splinters caused the target to bleed after each successful bash embedded them into the targets flesh.\nSometime before the , the weapon was carved by Makal of the Pine, and enchanted via boding the spirit of Makals fierce wolverine animal companion to the Gnasher. This dangerous weapon remained in Makals hands and served him on several occasions against orc loggers who threatened the druids forest. Makal of the Pine was presumed dead by 1369 DR, when Gnasher was wielded by the Shadow Druid named Dalok who plagued the town of Trademeet."
