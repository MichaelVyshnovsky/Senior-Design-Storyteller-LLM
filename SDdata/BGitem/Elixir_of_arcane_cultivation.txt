Elixirs of arcane cultivation were potions that temporarily expanded the imbibers mind, allowing them to temporarily hold more arcane or divine magic.
These concoctions were typically bottled in crude vials decorated with a string of various fetishes, feathers, bones, and beads.
When consumed, the elixir gave the imbibers an expanded state of mind, allowing them to cast one additional arcane spell or a divine prayer. The potions effects dissipated after the drinker took a rest of at least eight hours or if they consumed another long-acting magical concoction. More powerful versions of these potions existed, simply called greater elixirs of arcane
cultivation.
An elixir of arcane cultivation could be created using a special type of alchemical sublimate and a foul-slamming paste â€“ vitriol of weavemoss. A more powerful variety of the potion was created from suspension of laculite and a certain type of alchemical vitriol.
*Arron, a hin druid of the Emerald Grove in the late 15 century DR was known to sell these concoctions to the Groves visitors.
