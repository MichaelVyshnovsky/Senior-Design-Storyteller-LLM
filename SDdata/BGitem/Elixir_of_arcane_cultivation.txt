'''''Elixirs of arcane cultivation''''' were [[potion]]s that temporarily expanded the imbiber's mind, allowing them to temporarily hold more [[arcane]] or [[divine]] magic.

==Description==
These concoctions were typically bottled in crude vials decorated with a string of various fetishes, feathers, bones, and beads.

==Powers==
When consumed, the elixir gave the imbibers an expanded state of mind, allowing them to cast one additional arcane spell or a divine prayer. The potion's effects dissipated after the drinker took a rest of at least eight hours or if they consumed another long-acting magical concoction. More powerful versions of these potions existed, simply called ''greater elixirs of arcane
cultivation''.

==Creation==
An ''elixir of arcane cultivation'' could be created using a special type of alchemical sublimate and a foul-slamming paste – vitriol of [[weavemoss]]. A more powerful variety of the potion was created from suspension of [[laculite]] and a certain type of alchemical vitriol.

==Notalbe Uers==
*[[Arron]], a [[hin]] [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] was known to sell these concoctions to the Grove's visitors.
