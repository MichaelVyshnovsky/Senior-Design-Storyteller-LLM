        "mainbody": "The Iron Thorn, also known as the Cursed Ring of Slight Monsterism, were cursed rings that made wearers appear as horrifying decaying undead creatures.\nThese cursed rings were bands of iron that looked damaged, as if stained and burned by acid. The band itself was formed to resemble two iron thorns that held a crude lump of silver in the middle, reminiscent of a white skull on a black background, the symbol of Myrkul, Lord of Bones.\nThe Iron Thorn was a cursed item that changed the wearer appearance to that of a zombie, drastically reducing their charisma. Apart from the appearance, the ring reduced the wearers movement speed to that of a shambling undead. Once put on a finger, the the Iron Thorn could only be removed by a component cleric or via the remove curse spell.\nSeveral of these rings could be found in the bandit camp of Mulahey who was instrumental in creating the Iron crisis of 1368 DR. Another such ring was stashed away in Cloak Wood forest outside of Baldurs Gate, in the Centeols spider nest."
