        "mainbody": "Harper pins, also called harp pins, were enchanted brooches worn by members of the Harpers. Two main types were known, lesser and greater the greater was often considered the standard Harper pin.\nBoth lesser and greater Harper pins were typically made of silver. a crescent moon and harp. Circa 1479 DR, Harper pins were often appeared to be cheap, somewhat tarnished common brooches.\nThe lesser Harper pin bestowed on the wearer the same abilities as a ring of mind shielding, that is, shielding them from detect lies and detect thoughts, as well as any magical effect that would reveal their alignment.\nA more heavily enchanted version, the standard or greater Harper pin provided the wearer with significant protection against specific hazards.\nFirst, it greatly aided the wearer in resisting charm and enchantment spells and similar psionics or in other terms all mind-affecting magic and effects. Moreover, it completely  shielded against magical and psionic attempts to read the wearers mind or their alignment, granting the effect of an undetectable alignment spell.\nNext, it shielded the wearer from being scryed or detected by magical means, effectively granting a permanent nondetection effect. The wearer was simply \"not there.\" Similarly, the Harper pin itself could not be detected, though a locate object targeting another item in the wearers possession would still function.\nFinally, it protected the wearer from all magic missiles and granted a permanent resist elements versus electricity. It absorbed the energy into itself.\nThe silver used in greater pins was magically treated to be everbright so would never tarnish and to make it as hard as steel or even adamantine. Resistant to many effects, it could not be damaged by magical attacks.\nAnyone could wear a Harper pin, as they did not need attuning to their wearer and were not made to be attuned to specific members. However, if an evil creature should happen to wear a greater Harper pin, then some of them would turn black and produce loud and discordant jangling sounds, similar to a metal-stringed harp being played badly and even angrily. Naturally, this made it hard for the miscreant to sneak about. This continued until the villainous wearer removed it, after which it would quickly return to its normal hue.\nthumb|left|A Harper agent blatantly and proudly displaying where her loyalties lie in Neverwinter of 1479 DR.\nHarper pins in use in Neverwinter circa 1479 DR carried one, two, or three blessings from the goddesses Lliira, goddess of joy Mielikki, goddess of rangers and Tymora, goddess of luck. Beginner Harpers had access to one of their choice, experienced Harpers two, and veteran Harpers all three. These blessings protected the wearer from harm or aided them against a foe. Lliira bestowed joy and grace to help a Harper strike surely, lest they miss in an attack Mielikki granted endurance to pain, so they could shrug off an injury and Tymora gave luck to help them evade ill effects and magic. Furthermore, if injured, the wearer received a healing boon from their Harper pin.\nSome Harpers had pins with special powers. For example, Obslin Minstrelwish of Twilight Hall had one with the power of telekinesis, giving him the power to shift up to  of materials.\nThe reading of a Scroll of the Harpers would turn all Harper pins in range into real magical harps. A Harper pin was also the only magic item left unaffected by the playing of Joloras harp.\nStandard Harper pins were used by many senior members of the Harpers and by the Master Harpers, who, if they did not have one on their person, could readily acquire one. when needing to be recognized by other Harpers, Given the risk of Harper enemies finding them out, they usually kept their Harper pins hidden beneath their clothes or under their trims, inside gloves or sashes, or in special pouches inside their boots or bracers. Nevertheless, some, like Mari Almaren, would wear them openly and proudly on their collar when they could and the Harper druid Galvin showed his even when wild shaped, with it appearing as a silvery crescent moon marking on his fur or feathers. It was also not necessary to wear a Harper pin, particularly if the Harper in question had no true body, such as the firetail known as Flamedancer.\nIn addition to their magical protections, Harper pins could be used to prove ones affiliation with the order or to gain favor with their sympathizers. They were practically a necessity for non-elves to enter Evereska.\nFurthermore, Harper pins functioned as keys that would bypass the magical wards of Harper caches and safehouses, as strongholds and storehouses.\nRequiring quality craftsmanship and a high level of expertise in item enchantment, fashioning a Harper pin called for training in the making of magic items and an array of spells, including nondetection, protection from elements, resistance, shield, and undetectable alignment, as well as detect evil and ghost sound (only required for those that turned black). Notably, it was blessed by no less than three goddesses Lliira, Mielikki, and Tymora.\nCreators were often specialized in such unique Harper items as these. The smiths who crafted Harper pins worked in secret and only provided them to certain senior Harpers they knew well, not to anyone who came around seeking them. Circa 1367 DR, they were based in Deepingdale, Evereska, Everlund, Evermeet, High Horn, Lyrabar, Mintarn, Neverwinter, Shadowdale, Silverymoon, Starmantle, and Waterdeep. One was Jhenna Iliathor, at the Leaves of Learning temple in Highmoon, Deepingdale.\nthumb|left|250px|A Harper recruiter bestowing pins on new members.\nNew members of the Harpers were granted a lesser Harper pin only after joining the order Nevertheless, this could be a personal affairâ€”Bran Skorlsun sponsored his daughter Arilyn Moonblade and gave her his own pin. On occasion, a dying Harper had granted their pin and an unfinished quest to another, and that person could ultimately be accepted. Merely bestowing one with a witness was enough to mark one as a fellow Harper, as when Finder Wyvernspur, a founding member of the Harpers, gave his Harper pin to Olive Ruskettle, the so-called first halfling bard. \nThe market price for a lesser pin was 8,000 gp. The simpler Harper pins of 1479 DR were valued at only 680 gp, but were no less treasured by their users.\nBearing great power and significance,\nThe first harp pins were crafted by Elminster and Khelben Arunsun in the first century after the Harpers re-founding in the . Their pair appointed certain members as Master Harpers via dreams bestowed on them by Mystra then provided directions that led these Harpers to a cache of harp pins in Gochalls Tomb, which were arranged in a crescent atop the stone slab. Later dreams bade them to find skilled smiths and wizards to make more of them and that all true Harpers, and only true Harpers, should have them.\nThe murderous Amril Zoar of Waterdeep somehow acquired numerous Harper pins on which he layered no end of enchantments to use as traps. he slew Masked Lords Resengar and Tamaeril Bladesemmer in the same night, and left a Harper pin on Resengar. This pin was later examined by Laeral Silverhand, who was nearly blown to bits by a trap laid on it. In the same night, Amril used a gate to rush into the Yawning Portal but before he could attack Durnan he was fought back into the portal by Tamsil Dryndilstann and Mhaere Dryndilstann, dropped another trapped Harper pin before he left.\nWhen the Moonstars split from the Harpers in the , they stopped using their Harper pins and adopted Teukiir badges instead.\nFollowing the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the Harpers became legend, and it became popular for adventurous nobles of Waterdeep to don fake Harper pins. The situation became so bad that, by 1486 DR, High Harper Tam Zawad discouraged the wearing of Harper pins altogether among his agents, warning that if they were captured, then the pins would be easily discovered and stolen. Instead, it became increasingly common for Waterdhavian Harpers to wear magical tattoos instead, which could be concealed or displayed by uttering a secret phrase. Despite this, a few traditionalists still favored their pins.\nthumb|right|350px|When Harpers go bad. Edgin wearing his old pin to break into Korinns Keep.\nIn the mid-1490s DR, the ex-Harper bard Edgin Darvis led his team of thieves to Korinns Keep, a Harper stronghold filled with magic items seized from their villainous enemies. For this robbery, he donned his old Harper uniform, cloak, and Harper pin, which was needed to pass the magical ward and gain admittance to the building. It glowed as it did so."
