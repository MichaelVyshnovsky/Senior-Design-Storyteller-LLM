The Wheel of Obliteration was a powerful Sharran artifact that could open and seal shut permanent portals between the Prime Material plane and the Shadowfell.
The Wheel of Obliteration could only be activated when positioned near a large concentration of shadow gems. When in such a location, the artifact weakened the barrier between the Prime and the Shadowfell, allowing for the creation of portals between the two planes.
In the , monks of the Order of the Dark Moon accompanied the Wheel of Obliteration, and its protector Yxtrazzal to the mines beneath the Deepstone clanhold in Tethyr. The dwarf-held mines were rich with shadow gems.
The Sharrans enslaved the dwarves of Clan Deepstone and forced them to mine the special gems and to delve deeper than they had before. The Dark Moons leader Alorgoth sought to open a portal to the Shadowfell within the mines, in order to let loose hordes of shadow creatures to consume the lands above. Fortunately for the people of Tethyr, Alorgoths plans were thwarted by the Sun Soul monk Rasaad yn Bashir and his allies. The portal was closed in short order and the artifacts protector Yxtrazzal was slain. The Wheel of Obliteration itself was destroyed after being returned to the mines on Toril, never to be used again.
