Delvers Plate was a suit of plate mail armor, worn by the great Waterdhavian general, Delver Kinlake.
This +2 heavy plate mail granted the wearer limited protection from magical spells and abilities.
Delvers plate was originally granted to the vagabond general by Open Lord Baeron Silmaeril, as a token of appreciation for his years of service and leadership to the city. After Delver passed away the magnificent suit of armor was passed to eldest son.
Since then it was worn by by a number of adventurers and, by the mid-14 century DR, came into the possession of DigDag, an orc chieftain.
