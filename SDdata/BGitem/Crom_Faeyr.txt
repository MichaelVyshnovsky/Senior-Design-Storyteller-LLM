Crom Faeyr was a unique, but ultimately unfinished Hammer of Thunderbolts crafted by the dwarven smith known only as Silverblade.
Even without its full powers, Crom Faeyr was a powerful warhammer. 
Along with Crom Faeyr, Silverblade crafted a girdle of frost giant strength and a pair of gauntlets of ogre power, which he intended to use during the last parts of the enchanting process. The remaining steps were outlined on a scroll, uniquely inscribed for the creation of this great weapon.While it was possible to forge the completed Crom Faeyr in the Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn video game, 
In its unfinished state, Crom Faeyr possessed a +3 enchantment and granted its wielder no other boons. 
It was believed that when the hammer was imbued with its full powers it would imbue into its wielder the strength of a frost giant.  
Furthermore, Silverblade had intended for Crom Faeyr to possess the power to instantly kill trolls, ettins, and even golems with a single strike. 
Silverblade crafted the hammer, along with the other components needed to finalize its enchantments, with the intention of granting it to his son. He could do so however, as his son died while fighting in the dwarven army, battling against ogres and giants. 
Overcome with grief, Silverblade took up the unfinished hammer, armed himself with the belt and gauntlets set out to a noble end fighting the monsters that slew his son. 
As of the , the weapon was still unfinished. It made its way into the hands of a group of mind flayers who established a hidden refuge in the sewers beneath Athkatla. 
The girdle and gloves were scattered across Amn, while the scroll that detailed the process to active the full powers of Crom Faeyr came into the possession of the shadow dragon Thaxllssillyia.
