A ring of human influence was an enchanted ring that made its wearer much more charismatic and charming.
Count Fisfnilt had one of these rings fashioned by his court mage for his son Ewnin, while he was searching for an "acceptable" woman to be his bride. However, the princes standards were impossibly high. When Ewnin met an influential woman, who had been gifted the ring by the court mage, he became immediately infatuated with her and the couple wed within a months time.
