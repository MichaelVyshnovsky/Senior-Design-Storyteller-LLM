A helm of charm protection was a type of magical helm that protected its wearer from mind-altering spells and effects.
As the name suggests, this variety of helm shielded a persons mind from spells and abilities that fell under the charm classification. It did not however offer any protection against spells or effects that influenced the wearers emotions.
These helmets were often utilized by high-end mercenary companies to ensure the performance of their members.
One of these helmets was worn by the bandit Draug Fea.
The Athkatlan slavemaster Olaf Rassmussen also wore this type of helm.
