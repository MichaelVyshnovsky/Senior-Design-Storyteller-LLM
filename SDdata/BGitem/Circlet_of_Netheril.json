        "mainbody": "A circlet of Netheril was a powerful circlet from the long-lost Empire of Netheril that held within in potent magics that would greatly benefit any arcane spellcaster that bore it upon their brow.\nThe circlet appeared as a simple but elegant golden band. It was not decorated with any gems and would be considered to be too plain to be a piece of Netherese regalia. It was inscribed with obscure symbols that appeared to be arcane in origin.\nThe inherent powers of the circlet were hidden away upon first inspection, but could be released when it was combined with a certain kind of ioun stone. \nWhen a skilled smith combined the circlet of Netheril with a bronze ioun stone, the former could grant the wearer increased intellectual capacity to retain the specifics of two powerful spells each day, beyond their normal capabilities.\nAdditionally, it bolstered the wearers inherent vitality making them more difficult to down or slay in battle.\nOnly one circlet of Netheril was known to remain in existence as of the .\nThese items were highly coveted by all manner of mages and often drew undesirable notice from other spellcasters.\n* The Chromatic Demon that was interred within the Elemental Level of Watchers Keep in Tethyr."
