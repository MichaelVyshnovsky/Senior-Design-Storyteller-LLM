        "mainbody": "A '''''circlet of Netheril''''' was a powerful [[circlet]] from the long-lost Empire of [[Netheril]] that held within in potent magics that would greatly benefit any [[arcane spellcaster]] that bore it upon their brow.",
        "Description": "The circlet appeared as a simple but elegant [[gold]]en band. It was not decorated with any [[gem]]s and would be considered to be too plain to be a piece of Netherese regalia. It was inscribed with obscure symbols that appeared to be arcane in origin.",
        "Powers": "The inherent powers of the circlet were hidden away upon first inspection, but could be released when it was combined with a certain kind of ''[[ioun stone]]''. \n\nWhen a skilled smith combined the ''circlet of Netheril'' with a ''[[bronze ioun stone]]'', the former could grant the wearer increased intellectual capacity to retain the specifics of two powerful spells each day, beyond their normal capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, it bolstered the wearer's inherent vitality making them more difficult to down or slay in battle.",
        "History": "Only one ''circlet of Netheril'' was known to remain in existence as of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.",
        "Reputation": "These items were highly coveted by all manner of [[mage]]s and often drew undesirable notice from other spellcasters.",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[Chromatic Demon]] that was interred within the [[Watcher's Keep#Elemental Level|Elemental Level]] of [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Tethyr]]."
