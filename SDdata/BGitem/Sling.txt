Slings were a simple type of projectile weapon 
Slings consisted of a cord with a pouch to hold a projectile. These cords were typically made of either leather or some form of fabric.
Slings were intended to be held with one or two hands and twirled in a circle. Once a high speed of twirling was released, the wielder would then launch their projectile at an opponent by releasing one of the slings straps ends.
Against unarmored opponents a sling could produce severe bruising or even broken bones. However, they were not as powerful as bows, nor could they launch their projectiles as far as crossbows. Though compared to those weapons the sling was far cheaper and easier to make, costing effectively nothing if the proper materials could be found.

Slings were typically loaded with either smooth rounded stones or a ball of lead, known as sling bullets. However, unlike some projectiles they were very versatile and could be used to launch a variety of objects, such as rocks or coins.
