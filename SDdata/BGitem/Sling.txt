}}'''Slings''' were a simple type of projectile [[weapon]] 

==Description==
Slings consisted of a cord with a pouch to hold a projectile. These cords were typically made of either leather or some form of fabric.

==Weaponology==
Slings were intended to be held with one or two hands and twirled in a circle. Once a high speed of twirling was released, the wielder would then launch their projectile at an opponent by releasing one of the sling's strap's ends.

Against unarmored opponents a sling could produce severe bruising or even broken bones. However, they were not as powerful as [[bow]]s, nor could they launch their projectiles as far as [[crossbow]]s. Though compared to those weapons the sling was far cheaper and easier to make, costing effectively nothing if the proper materials could be found.

==Ammunition==

Slings were typically loaded with either smooth rounded stones or a ball of [[lead]], known as [[bullet|sling bullet]]s. However, unlike some projectiles they were very versatile and could be used to launch a variety of objects, such as rocks or [[coin]]s.

==Varieties==
* [[Calculus]]: An oversized ''sling'', designed to throw flasks filled with alchemical substances.
* [[Staff sling]]: A ''sling'' attachment for ''[[staves]]'', made to throw large bullets or heavy stones.

==Notable Slings==
* ''[[Arla's Dragonbane]]''
* ''[[Sling of seeking]]''
