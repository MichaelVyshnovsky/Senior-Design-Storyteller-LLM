A cloak of the Dark Moon was a type of enchanted cloak worn by monks of the Dark Moon, the monastic order devoted to Shar, the Lady of the Night.
This finely-woven cloak was a shroud of pure blackness, appearing to absorb any light that shone upon its surface. It radiated no dweomer or magical aura and would adjust in size to comfortably fit the wearer.
A cloak of the Dark Moon functioned similarly to a +2 cloak of protection— while also preventing the wearer from becoming blinded—but only while being worn at night. Three times per day the wearer to call upon the cloaks magic to gain temporary immunity from any and all harmful magic for 20 minutes, up to three times a day.
