Kondar was an enchanted bastard sword.
The bastard sword was named after its original owner and was more powerful when used against shapechangers, including doppelgangers. The sword also grew warm in the presence of shapeshifters. 
In 1368 DR, it was carried by Aldeth Sashenstar. Gorions Ward may have received the sword for helping Aldeth in the Cloakwood, or later, after helping him root out the doppelgangers infesting the Seven Suns.
