        "mainbody": "Glasses of identification were magical spectacles that allowed the wearer to see other magical items as they truly were.\nAfter putting the glasses on, the command words needed to activate the glasses would appear to float in the wearers field of vision. When activated they could see any enchantments, curses, or magical effects possessed by a given item.\nOne pair of these glasses were known to be offered for sale by Arledrian of the Shadow Thieves of Athkatla during the midâ€“14 century DR. Another pair was offered for sale by smuggler Carras of Amkethran in Calimshan. These glasses were also sold by vendors at Red Wizard Dennatons gladiatorial pits in Thay."
