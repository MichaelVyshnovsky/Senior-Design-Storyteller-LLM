The '''''Skull of Death''''' was a unique [[magic]]al [[helmet]] that was crafted by the [[lich]] [[N'Ashtar Nikadeemus]].

==Description==
The skull was made from the bones of Nikadeemus' parents.

==Powers==
The ''Skull of Death'' possessed a number of charges. Each charge allowed the wearer to [[death spell|instantly kill every living being within a certain area]].

==History==
N'Ashtar Nikadeemus bestowed the ''Skull of Death'' upon one of his greatest generals, who used it to slay the commanders they encountered on the battlefield.

It was rumored to have been destroyed some time after the lich was himself bested.

However, in [[1369 DR]], the skull was in the possession of the [[mage]] [[Vithal]].
