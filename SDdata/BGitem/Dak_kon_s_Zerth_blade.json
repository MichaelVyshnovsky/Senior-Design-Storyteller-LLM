        "Powers": "''Dak'kon's Zerth blade'' had a strong ''+2'' enchantment and increased the wielder's defenses. Additionally, when the sword was wielded by a user of [[arcane magic]], it expanded their mind allowing for memoization of four additional [[spell]]s per day.",
        "History": "''Dak'kon's Zerth blade'' accompanied its famous master on a journey alongside a mysterious individual only known as the [[Nameless One]]. Subsequently, Dak'kon was killed by a powerful entity. While it was unknown how a ''Dak'kon's Zerth blade'' appeared on [[Toril]], it came into the possession of a merchant named [[Deidre]], a member of [[Aurora's Magic Emporium]], during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|1369}} she began selling her wares in the [[Adventurer Mart]] of [[Athkatla]]."
