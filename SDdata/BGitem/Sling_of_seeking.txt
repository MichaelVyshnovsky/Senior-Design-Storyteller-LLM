The sling of seeking was a magical weapon with improved accuracy and damage over a normal sling. Some versions of this weapon provided infinite ammunition.
This weapon significantly improved a users accuracy and damage when hurling bullets at a target. It turned any type of standard sling bullet into the equivalent of a magically enchanted bullet. An improved version of this enchanted sling didnt require any sort of ammunition and could endlessly fire slightly enchanted bullets.
