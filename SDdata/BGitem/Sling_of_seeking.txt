The '''''sling of seeking''''' was a [[magical]] [[weapon]] with improved accuracy and damage over a normal [[sling]]. Some versions of this weapon provided infinite ammunition.

==Description==
This weapon significantly improved a user's accuracy and damage when hurling [[bullet]]s at a target. It turned any type of standard sling bullet into the equivalent of a magically enchanted bullet. An improved version of this enchanted sling didn't require any sort of ammunition and could endlessly fire slightly enchanted bullets.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Ellesime]], the [[elven]] queen of [[Suldanessellar]]
