A '''''potion of giant strength''''' was a type of concoction that modified the imbiber's raw physical power to that of a certain kind of [[giant]].

==Description==
The liquid of these types of potions was transparent and contained a fingernail of the specific [[giant]]. They varied in rarity from uncommon to legendary, which scaled with the power of the giant. Potions of giant strength were sold across [[Faer√ªn]].

''Potions of giant strength'' had a sliver of [[hill giant]]'s toe nail floating in the vials. The liquid itself had a fetid smell, making it hard to swallow.

==Powers==
The imbiber had an increased chance to hit opponents, as well as do more damage with thrown or melee [[weapon]]s. The types of potions available modified the user's strength from their own to that of a hill giant, [[frost giant]]/[[stone giant]], [[fire giant]], [[cloud giant]], a [[storm giant]], or even a [[reef giant]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Rock|11}}

==Availability==
Places and individuals in the ''Realms'' one could purchase ''potions of giant strength'' from included the following establishments:

*[[Sorcerous Sundries]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] sold all varieties of this potion.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Aasim]] owned a ''potion of stone giant strength''.
*[[Auntie Ethel]], a [[green hag]] trader of potions, lotions, quirks, and sundries from the Western Heartlands in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

*[[Derryth Bonecloak]], a beardless [[dwarf|dwarven]] potion merchant from [[Bonecloak's Apothecary]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
According to some rumors, if one were to substitute a part from an [[barrowe|undead hill giant]] in place of a living one, it would cause the resulting ''potion of hill giant strength'' to have the additional effect of granting an imbiber the barrowe's energy-draining attack.{{Cite dragon/254/Dragon's Bestiary: Giants from the Grave|91}}
