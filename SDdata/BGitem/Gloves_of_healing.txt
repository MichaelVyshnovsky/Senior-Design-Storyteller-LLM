'''''Gloves of healing''''' were [[magic]]al gauntlets that allowed the wearer to heal others and eradicate [[poison]]s from their bodies. They were often worn by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of benevolent [[deity|deities]].

==Usage==
These gauntlets were commonly used among members of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]], who would bestow them upon their novice members who had not yet learned how to cast [[divine magic]]. It was considered an honor for those outside of the [[paladin]] to be gifted a pair of these magic gauntlets.
