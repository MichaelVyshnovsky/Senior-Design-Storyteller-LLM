Burning Earth was a unique flame tongue sword.
The blade of Burning Earth burned with flames when drawn. The grip was crafted in a manner that was ill-suited for most humanoids. When held, it created tension in the wielders arm, though not enough to impede their skill in combat.
It bore a mysterious rune that indicated the sword was empowered by Toril itself.
Burning Earth possessed a +1 enchantment and burned foes with magical flame. It was particularly harmful to lycanthropes, trolls, winter wolves, and the undead.
It was unknown who or what created the sword, but legend stated that it was older than the Anauroch desert.
Some time before the , the sword made its way into the basement of Durlags Tower.
