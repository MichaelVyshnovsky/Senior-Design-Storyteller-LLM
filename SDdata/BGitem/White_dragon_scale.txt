White dragon scale was a variety of armor made from the scales of a white dragon.Despite being made from the dragons scales the armor was considered splint mail armor.
This armor offered the wearer protection from ice and cold energy, such as was emitted by white dragons breath weapon. They were also granted the power to emit a blast of frost and ice, up to three times per day.
The blacksmith Conlan of Kuldahar knew how to craft this type of armor, as did the imp Cespenar from the Throne of Blood.
