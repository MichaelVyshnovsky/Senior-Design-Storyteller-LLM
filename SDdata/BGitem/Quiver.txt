A quiver was a container for arrows that allowed for quickly drawing them during combat. Besides arrows, some were known to store javelins, quarrels, and similar missile weaponry within them.
Quivers were typically made of leather and had straps on them that allowed it to hang over a users shoulder.
A typical quiver could hold up to 20 arrows.
