        "mainbody": "The Flame of the North was an enchanted greatsword that originated from the North.\nThe sword possessed a +2 enchantment and was exceptionally harmful to those of chaotic evil disposition. It also bestowed a resistance to magic.\nThe Flame of the North took its name from the nickname of its owner, the fearsome warrior Carerra. She used this blade to slay scores of trolls and orcs across the frozen northlands, while the sword and her own rage guarded against the spells of shamans. After a long life of battle, Carerra passed away of natural causes and bequeathed the sword to her adventurer granddaughter.\nIt was believed that Carreras granddaughter brought the Flame of the North to the nation of Amn. At some point it found its way to the dungeon-complex beneath the island asylum of Spellhold by 1369 DR."
