'''''The Protector''''' was an specific ''[[amulet of protection]]'' that originated from the kingdom of [[Impiltur]].

==Powers==
This ''+1 [[amulet]]'' offered significant protection to its wearer.

==History==
During his reign over the kingdom, [[Pyronan|King Pyronan]] bestowed this boon as a gift to the members of his [[Royal Guard (Impiltur)|Royal Guard]]. The royal protectors had difficult arriving at a consensus about who among them should wear the amulet. These arguments continued for years, during which the magical amulet disappeared. Eventually the king's guards were replaced by less greedy individuals.

The royal guard of King Pyronan, ruler of Impiltur, were given 'The Protector' as an honorary show of status. Unfortunately, members of the guard had trouble coming to a consensus amongst themselves as to whom the amulet should go to. After years of internal hostility, the item was lost and the guards were replaced by less greedy individuals.

Eventually the amulet made its way to the [[Sword Coast]], where it came into the possession of the owner of [[Feldepost's Inn]]. By the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], it was available for sale for a significant sum.
