A '''''mail of the dead''''' was a set of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[chainmail]] armor that earned its name by famously being worn by [[undead]] warriors.

==Powers==
This type of armor possessed a ''+2 enchantment''.

==History==
Some time during or before the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[mage]] [[Vorusta]] used ''mails of the dead'' to great effect. He would conjure forth ''[[skeleton warrior]]s'', armor them with the magical chainmail, and equip them with a great weapon before dispatching them as assassins. After they slew their targets, he gathered up the armor and arms to prepare for another killing.

==Notable Owners==
The assassin [[Molkar]] of the [[Sword Coast]] wore a suit of this armor while he and his fellow killers went to kill [[Abdel Adrian]].
