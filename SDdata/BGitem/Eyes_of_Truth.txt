The Eyes of Truth, also called the Helmet of Infravision, was a magical helm that granted enhanced sight. It was worn by several individuals in Faerûn, particularly around the border between the Sword Coast and Amn, during the mid–14 century DR.
The helm allowed the wielder to see with infravision for up to 120 feet (36.6 meters). It also protected them receiving serious injuries in battle.
The helm was crafted by the scavenger dungeoneer Babette Maelestrom. While most considered her an eagle-eyed treasure hunter, she attributed her vast accumulation of wealth to her helm.
Some time before 1368 DR the Eyes of Truth came into the possession of a bounty hunter named Neira, who was hired by Sarevok Anchev to kill his fellow divine siblings of Bhaal. One of them, Gorions Ward, may have taken it from her in the Nashkel mines. However, another may have been found by them in Jon Irenicuss dungeon the following year.
