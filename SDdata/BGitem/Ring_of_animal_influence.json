        "mainbody": "A ring of animal influence, also known as a ring of animal friendship, was a magical ring that allowed its wearer to communicate with and influence the behavior of animals.\nRings of animal influence created by the druids of High Forest were crafted out of magically preserved green brambles and twigs. These rings smelled of edible berries.\nEach use of the ring allowed its wearer to cast the animal friendship, fear, or speak with animals spells, any of which could only target beasts. The ring could be used in this way up to three times, after which it gradually recovered its magic over successive dawns. Pre-Spellplague versions only contained animal frienship, which could be used at will.\nIt was said that the secret of creating rings of animal influence was kept guarded by the druids of Cormanthor. In mid 14 century DR very few of these rings were seen outside of druidic orders, although some have been sold by exiled and fallen members and looted of the druids bodies.\nBy the late 14 century, more ring of animal influence could be seen outside of the druids circles. The rings that originated from the High Forest could be found across the Sword Coast and were imbued with divine magic of Mielikki and Silvanus.\nthumb|Sherry Feldstones ring of animal friendship\n*Bosco Daggerhand, owner of the Boscos Bilge tavern in Jahaka Anchorage, owned a ring of animal influence in the late 15 century DR.
