        "mainbody": "Bracers of the blinding strike were a pair of magical bracers worn on the wrists.\nBracers of the blinding strike looked either like a pair of wrist guards or arm guards.\nThe bracers weighed 1 lb (0.45 kg).\nIn addition to serving as bracers of armor +6, the bracers gave the wearer excellent reaction time in battle and allowed them to attack more swiftly and more often. Originally, the latter two abilities were only usable by people with warrior training, with the acceleration power usable only three times per day. By 1372 DR, the bracers were improved to confer the abilities to anybody and the acceleration was permanent.\nBracers of the blinding strike were magic items associated with the drow.\nOne of the most notable mentions of the bracers of the blinding strike came from the story of a young student of the Monastery of the Dark Moon named Beyl Van Yoren. Her faith in Shar was shaken and she abandoned her studies with the influence of a transmuter named Vergol. As a punishment for her desertion, the elders of the order tasked a group of their best students with tracking her down. They were outfitted with bracers of the blinding strike to counter Beyls masterful use of the haste spell. The elders did not realize, however, that Beyl was proficient in slow and other hindering spells. The students outfitted with these bracers were never seen ever since.\n*Dantrag Baenre In 1357 DR, the drow weapon master Dantrag Baenre of Menzoberranzan wore bracers of the blinding strike. However, owing to the speed they imparted, Dantrag was unable to improvise during combat. The drow ranger Drizzt DoUrden was able to exploit Dantrags weakness, forcing him to stick to rote and practiced combinations, which allowed Drizzt to gain the upper hand.\n*Drizzt DoUrden In 1358 DR, Drizzt wore the bracers over his wrists to increase his attack speed, but due to the sudden lunging of his lightning-quick attacks, he soon realized they restricted and hampered his ability to adapt and improvise during any particular strike or defensive block, whereas normally he could change the direction, speed and angle mid-movement. Since he could not maneuver during any particular strike or defensive block, he moved the bracers to his legs to balance out his agile reflexes.\n*Wesic a knight from the Order of the Radiant Heart whose saying about striking fast and winning the battle became a popular aphorism. He was leading by example while using the bracers of the blinding strike. Wesic activated the bracerss magic and rushed into battle, often ending it within seconds.\n*Dayne Lynneth a merchant from Neverwinters Blacklake District had a pair of the bracers of the blinding strike in her inventory circa 1374 DR."
