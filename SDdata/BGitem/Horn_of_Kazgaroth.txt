The Horn of Kazgoroth was an artifact that could be used as a horn. Peculiarly, it released enchantments when played, instead of musical sound.
The artifact resembled a blackened and twisted horn. Unlike the artifact from the same being known as the Claw of Kazgaroth, it was not cursed.
When blown, the user was surrounded by a globe of power that gave them resistance to magical effects. As well as high resistance to missile attacks, effects from wands, breath weapons, and polymorphing, the powerful artifact gave complete immunity to minor spells. However, whenever it was blown, the horn would extract some life force from the user.
The horn, which was actually a tusk, was once of the powerful beast and aspect of Bhaal named Kazgaroth, which took the natural form of a tyrannosaurus. It was later enchanted by an unknown mage, and was later found in a magic store in Beregost, alongside the Claw of Kazgaroth.
