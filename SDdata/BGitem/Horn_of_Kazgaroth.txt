The '''''Horn of Kazgoroth''''' was an [[artifact]] that could be used as a [[horn]]. Peculiarly, it released [[enchantment]]s when played, instead of musical sound.

==Description==
The artifact resembled a blackened and twisted horn. Unlike the artifact from the same being known as the ''[[Claw of Kazgaroth]]'', it was not [[curse]]d.

==Powers==
When blown, the user was surrounded by a globe of power that gave them resistance to [[magic]]al effects. As well as high resistance to missile attacks, effects from [[wand]]s, [[breath]] weapons, and [[polymorph]]ing, the powerful artifact gave complete immunity to minor [[spells]]. However, whenever it was blown, the horn would extract some life force from the user.

==History==
The ''horn'', which was actually a tusk, was once of the powerful beast and [[aspect]] of [[Malar|Bhaal]] named [[Kazgaroth]], which took the natural form of a [[tyrannosaurus]]. It was later enchanted by an unknown [[mage]], and was later found in a magic store in [[Beregost]], alongside the [[Claw of Kazgaroth]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Thalantyr]], a powerful [[conjurer]] who sold various magical wares, including the horn.
