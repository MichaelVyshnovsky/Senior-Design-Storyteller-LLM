Gram the Sword of Grief was a powerful enchanted greatsword associated with the legendary hero Siegfried.
The sword was a masterpiece of craftsmanship. It was balanced well for battle and had a particularly sharp blade. Its hilt bore an image of a snake that was barely perceptible.
Every time the sword Gram struck a foe, there was a chance it would inflict poison into the wound it made.
At some point the sword came out of the possession of Siegfried. By the midâ€“14 century DR, it had come into the possession of the blue dragon Abazigal, who wielded it while in his humanoid form.
Only known to a select few, including the imp Cespenar, the greatsword Gram could be improved by a smith of sufficient skill. 
It was believed that setting the malevolent heart of the damned within the pommel of the blade, it would be granted the additional power to drain away the life force of others.
