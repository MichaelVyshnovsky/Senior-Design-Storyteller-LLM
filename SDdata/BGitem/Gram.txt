'''''Gram the Sword of Grief''''' was a powerful [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[greatsword]] associated with the legendary hero [[Siegfried]].

==Description==
The sword was a masterpiece of craftsmanship. It was balanced well for battle and had a particularly sharp blade. Its hilt bore an image of a snake that was barely perceptible.

==Powers==
Every time the sword ''Gram'' struck a foe, there was a chance it would inflict [[poison]] into the wound it made.

==History==
At some point the sword came out of the possession of Siegfried. By the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], it had come into the possession of the [[blue dragon]] [[Abazigal]], who wielded it while in his [[humanoid]] form.

==Rumors & Legends==
Only known to a select few, including the [[imp]] [[Cespenar]], the greatsword ''Gram'' could be improved by a smith of sufficient skill. 

It was believed that setting the malevolent ''[[heart of the damned]]'' within the pommel of the blade, it would be granted the additional power to [[energy drain|drain away the life force]] of others.
