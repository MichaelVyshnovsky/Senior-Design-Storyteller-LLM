The girdle known as Elves bane was a magical item that protected its wearer from piercing weapons such as daggers or arrows shot from a bow.
This large belt was worn by the infamous highwayman Pandar, of Scardale. He often ran afoul of the elves of Cormanthor, while hiding throughout the forest constantly one step ahead of their chase. While the girdle protected Pandar from the elves volleys of arrows, he was no match for a pit-trap, which served as his home during the last days of his life before he starved to death.
Some time later the girdle came into the possession of a dwarf named Unshey, who in turn had it stolen away from her by an ogre who had a very particular taste for belts and girdles.
