The girdle known as '''''Elves' bane''''' was a [[Item enchantment|magical item]] that protected its wearer from piercing weapons such as [[dagger]]s or [[arrow]]s shot from a [[bow]].

==History==
This large belt was worn by the infamous highwayman [[Pandar]], of [[Scardale]]. He often ran afoul of the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthor]], while hiding throughout the forest constantly one step ahead of their chase. While the girdle protected Pandar from the elves volleys of arrows, he was no match for a pit-trap, which served as his home during the last days of his life before he starved to death.

Some time later the girdle came into the possession of a [[dwarf]] named [[Unshey]], who in turn had it stolen away from her by an [[ogre]] who had a very particular taste for belts and girdles.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Kalah]], a [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] who held the circus in [[Athkatla]] hostage in [[1369 DR]].
