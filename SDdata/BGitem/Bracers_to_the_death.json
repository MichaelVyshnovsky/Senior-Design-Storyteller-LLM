        "mainbody": "The '''''bracers to the death''''' were a specific set of ''[[bracers of defense]]'' that circulated around [[Faerûn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "These [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[bracer]]s greatly increased the defenses of the wearer, assuming they were wearing no [[armor]] other than simple clothes.",
        "History": "The bracers once belonged to a gladiator of an unknown land, who wore them while fighting in the arena for decades. While he was undefeated for years, he was finally killed the day that the ''bracers to the death'' went missing.\n\nDuring the 1360's, rumors circulated that they were still worn by those who engaged in feats of competitive combat. In truth they had been in the possession of the [[mage]] [[Davaeorn]], who had been working as an agent of the [[Iron Throne]] within the [[Cloak Wood mines|mines]] beneath the [[Cloak Wood]] forest.\n\nBy the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]] they had come into the possession of another [[wizard]] [[Mekrath]], who had imprisoned the [[tiefling]] performer [[Haer'Dalis]] beneath the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] of [[Athkatla]].",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Elan Garaq]], a [[rakshasa]] trader in the [[Black Pits]].\n*[[Dulf Ebonbeard]], [[Gerrold Darkfellow]], and [[Gezzthemin]] from [[Dennaton]]'s gladiatorial [[Thay]]vian arena."
