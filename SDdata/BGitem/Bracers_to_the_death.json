        "mainbody": "The bracers to the death were a specific set of bracers of defense that circulated around Faer√ªn during the 14 century DR.\nThese magical bracers greatly increased the defenses of the wearer, assuming they were wearing no armor other than simple clothes.\nThe bracers once belonged to a gladiator of an unknown land, who wore them while fighting in the arena for decades. While he was undefeated for years, he was finally killed the day that the bracers to the death went missing.\nDuring the 1360s, rumors circulated that they were still worn by those who engaged in feats of competitive combat. In truth they had been in the possession of the mage Davaeorn, who had been working as an agent of the Iron Throne within the mines beneath the Cloak Wood forest.\nBy the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR they had come into the possession of another wizard Mekrath, who had imprisoned the tiefling performer HaerDalis beneath the Temple District of Athkatla.\n*Elan Garaq, a rakshasa trader in the Black Pits.\n*Dulf Ebonbeard, Gerrold Darkfellow, and Gezzthemin from Dennatons gladiatorial Thayvian arena."
