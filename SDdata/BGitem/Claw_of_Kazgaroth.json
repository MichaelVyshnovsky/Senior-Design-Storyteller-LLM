        "mainbody": "The Claw of Kazgaroth was a powerful artifact that could be used as a magical ring.\nThe artifact, which was cursed, had multiple enchantments. The curse effect lowered the wielders vigor and fed off their blood, but provided them with numerous benefits. The image of the wielder would become blurry and thus far more difficult to hit. Unlike most other items that provided protection, the claw made it easier to avoid attacks from weapons, missiles, and even effects from wands. As well as standard spell effects, the wearer could resist polymorphing and breath attacks.\nDue to the claws curse, the wearer would become sick more often and was prone to the effects of poison. It could only be removed with the remove curse spell.\nThe claw was once part of Kazgaroth, a powerful beast and aspect of Malar, which took the natural form of a tyrannosaurus. After the evil beast fell, the claw was extracted from its corpse. It is unknown how, but the artifact ended up in High Hedge, Beregost, where it was listed for sale at a very high price, amongst other magical items.\n* Thalantyr, a powerful conjurer who sold various magical wares, including the claw."
