        "Powers": "This suit of leathers possessed a ''+3 enchantment'' and offered its wearer significant protection against [[:Category:Piercing weapons|piercing]] [[weapon]]s and [[:Category:Projectile weapons|projectiles]] such as [[arrow]]s and [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s.",
        "History": "This armor once belonged to [[Karajah]], the champion of [[Calimshan|Calimshan's]] pit-fighting rings. For 10 years Karajah fought in the pits, wearing only this suit of armor and a set of spiked [[gauntlet]]s. While he claimed his success was due to his lightning-fast reflexes, the [[magic]]al enchantments imbued in his armor were eventually revealed to his fellow combatants and the spectators in the crowds.\n\nIt was unknown if Karajah's death was caused by his fellow warriors caused his death or if it was him being thrown into a pit with a [[club]]-wielding [[ogre]]. While Karajah's body was destroyed, his armor was not.\n\nBy the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], ''Karajah's Life and Death'' had come into the possession of [[Ribald Barterman]] and was available for sale in the [[Adventurer Mart]] within the city of [[Athkatla]]."
