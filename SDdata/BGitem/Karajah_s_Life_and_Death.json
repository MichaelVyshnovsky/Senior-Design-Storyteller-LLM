        "mainbody": "Karajahs Life and Death was a heavily-enchanted suit of leather armor that appeared in the realms throughout the 14century DR.\nThis suit of leathers possessed a +3 enchantment and offered its wearer significant protection against piercing weapons and projectiles such as arrows and crossbow bolts.\nThis armor once belonged to Karajah, the champion of Calimshans pit-fighting rings. For 10 years Karajah fought in the pits, wearing only this suit of armor and a set of spiked gauntlets. While he claimed his success was due to his lightning-fast reflexes, the magical enchantments imbued in his armor were eventually revealed to his fellow combatants and the spectators in the crowds.\nIt was unknown if Karajahs death was caused by his fellow warriors caused his death or if it was him being thrown into a pit with a club-wielding ogre. While Karajahs body was destroyed, his armor was not.\nBy the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Karajahs Life and Death had come into the possession of Ribald Barterman and was available for sale in the Adventurer Mart within the city of Athkatla."
