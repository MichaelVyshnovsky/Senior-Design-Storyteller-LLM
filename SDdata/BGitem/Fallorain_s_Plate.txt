Fallorains Plate was a set of enchanted plate mail, worn by Captain Fallorain of Calimshan, sometime before 1368 DR.
This set of armor was a combination of chain armor and plates of hard steel that shielded vital areas of the wearer. Metal plates were placed to protect chest, abdomen, and groin areas.
Fallorains Plate held a simple +1 enchantment.
This plate mail belonged to Captain Fallorain, the leader of Calimshans 12 cavalry brigade. The commander wore this enchanted armor to the Battle of the Spider Swamp, where he and his comrades met their doom battling some evil whose name was lost to history.
With time, several copies of this enchanted plate mail were created.
*Genthore a human adventurer who was hired to defend the Cloakwood mine circa 1368 DR.
*Gorch the Armorer a dwarf heavy armor merchant in Baeloth Barrityls Black Pits in the Underdark.
*Odren a devotee of Helm and one of the Knights of the Vigil, in the midâ€“14 century DR.
