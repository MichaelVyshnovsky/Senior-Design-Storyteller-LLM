Gorms arm was a tower shield that was heavily enchanted to protect the wielder.
The huge shield was made of dwarven darksteel, and provided even more protection than most full suits of armor. It was very heavy, and weighed a lot more than typical shields, even those of the same size. Due to its large size and weight, it was literally impossible to cast spells when using it, and only those of high strength could even begin to use it.
Gorms arm, as well as protecting its wielder from physical attacks, granted them high resistance to magic.
