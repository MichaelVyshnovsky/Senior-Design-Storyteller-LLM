'''''Gorm's arm''''' was a [[tower shield]] that was heavily [[magic|enchanted]] to protect the wielder.

==Description==
The huge shield was made of dwarven [[darksteel]], and provided even more protection than most full suits of [[armor]]. It was very heavy, and weighed a lot more than typical shields, even those of the same size. Due to its large size and weight, it was literally impossible to cast [[spell]]s when using it, and only those of high strength could even begin to use it.

==Powers==
''Gorm's arm'', as well as protecting its wielder from physical attacks, granted them high resistance to [[magic]].
