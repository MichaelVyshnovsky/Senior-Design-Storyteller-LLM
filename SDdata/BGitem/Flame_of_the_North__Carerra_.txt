The '''''Flame of the North''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[greatsword]] that originated from [[the North]].

==Powers==
The sword possessed a ''+2 enchantment'' and was exceptionally harmful to those of [[chaotic evil]] disposition. It also bestowed a resistance to [[magic]].

==History==
The ''Flame of the North'' took its name from the nickname of its owner, the fearsome warrior [[Carerra]]. She used this blade to slay scores of [[troll]]s and [[orc]]s across the frozen northlands, while the sword and her own rage guarded against the [[spell]]s of [[shaman]]s. After a long life of battle, Carerra passed away of natural causes and bequeathed the sword to her [[adventurer]] granddaughter.

It was believed that Carrera's granddaughter brought the ''Flame of the North'' to the nation of [[Amn]]. At some point it found its way to the dungeon-complex beneath the island asylum of [[Spellhold]] by [[1369 DR]].
