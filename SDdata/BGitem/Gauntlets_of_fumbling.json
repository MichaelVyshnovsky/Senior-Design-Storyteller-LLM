        "mainbody": "Gauntlets of fumbling was a name given to various gloves and gauntlets that all possessed similar curse, found in Faer√ªn.\nThese items could be crafted out of hardy leather, ring mail, chain mail, or any other material.\nIn appearance, they often looked almost indistinguishable from gauntlets of dexterity or gauntlets of ogre power, which made the curse even more dangerous. If someone were to test the gauntlets magic, they would be completely convinced that the items they were wearing were harmless. That changed, however, come the battle as combat was the curses activation. The curse crippled the wearers nimbleness, aim, and dexterity. Like other cursed items, gauntlets of fumbling could only be taken off via remove curse.\n*Elanders gloves of misplacement Created by mischievous Elander in order to defeat his bitter rival sometime before 1368 DR, these cursed gloves never reached their intended party. Elander fell victim to his own malice when he mistook his gloves of misplacement for a regular pair. Subsequently, in 1368 DR these gloves found a way onto the hands of crazed priest of Cryirc, Bassilus the Murderer of Beregost.\n*Tsenya Bhrokiti the princess of Ra-Khati was gifted a handful of cursed items by Ambuchar Devayam in 1360 DR, one of which was a get of gauntlets of fumbling.\nGauntlets of fumbling could be created by a skilled wondrous item crafter with the use of bestow curse spell."
