The cloak of bravery was an enchanted cloak that gave the wearer immunity to panic and fear.
The powerful cloak was made from the skin of nymphs that were sewn together in a crude manner. The cloak of bravery was said to be evil, but did not seem to be sentient. It weighed 3 lbs (1.4 kg) and sold for around 300 gp.
