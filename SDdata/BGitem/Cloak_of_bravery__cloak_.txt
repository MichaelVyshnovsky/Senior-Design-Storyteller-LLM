The '''''cloak of bravery''''' was an enchanted [[cloak]] that gave the wearer immunity to panic and fear.

==Description==
The powerful cloak was made from the skin of [[nymph]]s that were sewn together in a crude manner. The ''cloak of bravery'' was said to be [[evil]], but did not seem to be sentient. It weighed 3 lbs (1.4 kg) and sold for around 300 [[gp]].
