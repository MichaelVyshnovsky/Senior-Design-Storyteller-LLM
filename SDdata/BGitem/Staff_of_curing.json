        "mainbody": "Staves of curing were enchanted curative staves said to have been created by Torm, the Loyal Fury.\nSome staves of curing were imbued with a +1 enchantment, increased defenses, and allowed their wielders to cast cure serious wounds as well as heal any negative effects such as poison, blindness or deafness, intoxication, etc., while others only possessed curative magic and enchanted the wielders skills in healing and medicine.\nEven though it was believed that Torm manifested these staves at the times of dire strife,, the deity responsible for these items changed depending on whom one was to ask. Because of that, many believed that the staves of curing were sent by a collective of goodly gods to mortals in need.\nBy the late 14 century DR, staves of curing could be found across the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions.\nCirca 1370 DR, a staff of curing was kept in the kitchen of the House of the Moon temple of Sel√ªne in Waterdeep. The senior priest on duty carried it to heal injuries and to deal with the green slime used for waste disposal if it got out of control."
