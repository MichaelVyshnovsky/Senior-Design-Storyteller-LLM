A dragonscale shield, also known as a dragon shield, was a type of enchanted shield crafted from the scales of one or several dragons.
The form and appearance of these shields varied from one creator to another. Some shields featured the scales of a single specimen, while others were composed of dragon hide adorned with scales of different hues.
Similar to their varied appearances, these shields held enchantments of different levels and offered a number of different powers or boons.
