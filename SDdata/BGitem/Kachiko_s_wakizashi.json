        "Powers": "This [[wakizashi]] possessed a powerful ''+3'' enchantment that improved the wielder's aim and dealt more powerful damage than an ordinary blade. Upon a successful slash, ''Kachiko's wakizashi'' had a chance of temporarily stupefying the opponent, effectively reducing their perceptiveness with each landed attack.",
        "History": "Little was recorded of the weapon's history. The only thing known for sure was its owner – a female [[warrior]] named [[Kachiko]] who wielded this wakizashi somewhere in Kara-Tur, sometime before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Kachiko's wakizashi'', along with several other magic items from Icewind Dale, ended up in the hands of the merchant named [[Joluv]] who traveled from [[Icewind Dale]] to the City of Coin, [[Athkatla]], to sell the items to wealthy Amnian adventurers. Joluv peeled his wars from the [[Copper Coronet]] in Athkatla's [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]]."
