Sword Coast
Aegers Hide was an enchanted suit of armor that was crafted from the hide of the fabled bear known as the Aeger.
The armor possessed a +2 enchantment. The wearer was immune to mind-altering effects that sought to confuse or befuddle individuals.
Several centuries before the mid-1300s DR, the Aeger was slain by a group of nearly two hundred militiamen. The armor was crafted some time thereafter.
At some point Aegers Hide made its way into the possession of the Adventurer Mart in the city of Athkatla.
