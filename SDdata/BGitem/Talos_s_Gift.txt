Taloss Gift, also known as boots of grounding, were enchanted copper-plated boots rumored to have been created by Talos himself.
Boots of grounding gave their wearer resistance to electricity and lightning.
Many years before 1368 DR, a pair of Taloss Gift boots was given by the the Storm Lord himself to a single man, a simple resident of the Fortress of the Starshine Peninsula. Talos rained fury, earthquakes, and storms upon the citadel after his favorite Stormherald was murdered within its walls. This pair of boots of groundings purpose were to save the life of one singular person of the citadel, so the tale of Talos divine fury could reach the masses.
Eventually, that man was discovered by a group of adventurers, alone in the ruined city and driven mad by the death and destruction he witnessed. Taloss Gift later found their way to many places across the world, carrying the tale of godly destruction.
