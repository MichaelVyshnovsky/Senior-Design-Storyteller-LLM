'''''Talos's Gift''''', also known as '''''boots of grounding''''', were enchanted [[copper]]-plated [[boot]]s rumored to have been created by [[Talos]] himself.

==Powers==
''Boots of grounding'' gave their wearer resistance to electricity and lightning.

==History==
Many years before [[1368 DR]], a pair of ''Talos's Gift'' boots was given by the the [[Talos|Storm Lord]] himself to a single man, a simple resident of the [[Fortress]] of the [[Starshine Peninsula]]. Talos rained fury, earthquakes, and storms upon the citadel after his favorite [[Stormherald]] was murdered within its walls. This pair of ''boots' of grounding's'' purpose were to save the life of one singular person of the citadel, so the tale of Talos' divine fury could reach the masses.

Eventually, that man was discovered by a group of adventurers, alone in the ruined city and driven mad by the death and destruction he witnessed. ''Talos's Gift'' later found their way to many places across the world, carrying the tale of godly destruction.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Bashshar al Rachid]], a famous collector, merchant, and the wealthiest [[djinni]] on [[Toril]] in the early 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Bolumir]]: a cleric of [[Tempus]] from [[Athkatla]] ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].
*[[Elan Garaq]]: a [[rakshasa]] trader and [[Baeloth Barrityl]]'s right-hand from the [[Black Pits]] of [[Underdark]].
*[[Mulahey]]: the agent of the [[Iron Throne]] responsible for creating the [[iron crisis]].
