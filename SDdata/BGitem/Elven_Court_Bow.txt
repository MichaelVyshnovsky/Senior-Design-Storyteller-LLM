The Elven Court bow was an ancient, ceremonial longbow from the Elven Court, one of cities of the empire of Cormanthyr.
The bow was made of polished yew and had been intricately engraved. Its bowstring shined gold, and emanated a song-like resonance when drawn.
This +3 longbow greatly increased the accuracy of its wielder.
A weapon of the elves for millennia, this exquisite bow was passed down every half-century to someone who had performed a great deed for the elves of the Court. In the midâ€“12 century DR, a human named Yin Pon was gifted the bow of the court after rescuing an elven prince from danger. Yin carried the bow with him to the city of Baldurs Gate where it was eventually lost.
