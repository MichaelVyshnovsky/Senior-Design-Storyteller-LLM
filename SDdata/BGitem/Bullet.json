        "mainbody": "A '''bullet''', or '''sling bullet''', which was sometimes referred to as a '''pellet''', was a type of ammunition that was launched from a [[sling]].",
        "Description": "Bullets were spherically shaped and usually pieces of lead, which was very dense. Sling bullets could also be made of [[copper]] or even exotic materials, such as the knuckles of [[salamander]]s or chips of [[elemental]]s.\n\nThey most often came in [[leather]] [[pouch]]es, which could hold ten of them. Like [[arrow]]s and [[bolt]]s, some bullets were [[magical|enchanted]] in some way so that they could deal more damage. Bullets that struck targets were destroyed in the process, but had a chance of being recovered.",
        "Notable Bullets": "* ''[[Bullet of Darkness]]'': a variety of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] bullets that were carved from [[voidstone]].\n* ''[[Bullet of Electricity]]''\n* ''[[Fire bullet]]'': a variety of enchanted bullets that were carved from the knucklebones of [[salamander]]s.\n* ''[[Ice bullet]]'': a variety of enchanted bullets that were carved from the bodies of [[ice para-elemental]]s.\n* ''[[Sunstone bullet]]'': a variety of enchanted bullets that were crafted from [[Sunstone (gem)|sunstones]]"
