'''''Khalid's Gift''''', or simply '''''The Gift''''', was a unique [[enchanted]] [[necklace]] created by the [[Harper]] [[Khalid]] as an anniversary present in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Oh dear—should I brace myself for some fashion advice? But, I suppose you have earned better than glibness from me. It was a gift from my husband. Khalid.''|High Harper [[Jaheira]]}}

==Description==
''Khalid's Gift'' was a hand-crafted necklace. It was weaved using the finest [[spider silk]] and decorated with a large clear [[aquamarine]] [[gemstone]].

==Powers==
''The Gift'' possessed a variety of enchantments. However, it was unclear if any magic occurred during the amulet's creation. Some believed that no arcane manipulations took place and its magic was naught but the reflection of Khalid's deep love and affection for his wife.

Some of the item's enchantments increased the wearer's natural beauty and charisma, and wisdom. ''Khalid's Gift'' also imbued Jaheira with vitality, rejuvenating her and making the [[half-elven]] woman glow with youth. While Jaheira wore the necklace she could not get fatigued and was protected from being ''[[curse]]d''. Additionally, she could cast the [[spell]] ''[[aid]]'' once per day.

==History==
Khalid created the amulet in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, during his and Jaheira's involvement in [[Caelar Argent]]'s crusade against the [[Dragonspear Castle]]. With aid from their friend, the famed [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Abdel Adrian]], Khalid collected the materials for the Gift's creation: spider silk from the [[Forest of Wyrms]] and a perfect unblemished aquamarine from the [[Underdark]]. He surprised Jaheira on their anniversary with the amulet imbued with rejuvenating and protective magic.

A century after Khalid's death, Jaheira, now the [[High Harper]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], considered the necklace to be a worthless trinket but also her most prized possession. She kept it secure underneath her home in the Gate, along with other mementos of her younger and more adventurous days.
