A Solar Aegis was a variety of medium shield created for and carried by the most righteous warriors of the Realms.
A Solar Aegis was at least partially layered with silver that never tarnished and always shone with radiance, despite the circumstances of use or battle. They featured intricate engravings and were inlaid with brilliant gems, such as sapphires.
The shield offered great protection to its wielder from the forces of evil, bestowing upon them greater vitality and protection from both mundane and magical flames.
These shields most often forged and enchanted for paladins belonging to fighting orders of the Realms morally upstanding faiths.
