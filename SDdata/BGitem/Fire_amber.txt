'''Fire ambers''' were a type crystal with [[alchemical]] properties found in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[West Faerûn]].

==Description==
Fire ambers were red sharp crystals with a fiery glow radiating from their centers. When these crystals were burnt and ground into ashes, the formed substance sparked and sparkled when agitated despite remaining completely cold. This ash could be mixed with certain type of [[salt]]s to quell its fire magic and brewed into ''[[alchemist's fire]]''.
