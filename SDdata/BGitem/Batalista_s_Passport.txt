Batalistas Passport was a variation of a ring of fire resistance originally created by the grand mage Batalista.
Batalistas Passport allowed the wearer to survive even the hottest of flames, granting them resistance to fire.
The original ring of Batalistas Passport was created by the grand mage Batalista to protect him through his travels through the Elemental Plane of Fire. It was believed that the wizard summoned salamanders to consult them during the rings crafting process. However, salamanders were not known for their patience. Batalistas consultant was annoyed with harassment by a mortal mage. A mysterious pyre engulfed the grand mages tower with only one thing recovered from the ashes - Batalistas finger with the Passport on it, untouched by the raging flames. It was presumed that if the rings finger was still attached to the wizards hand Batalista wouldve survived the fire.
Over the years that followed Batalistas Passport was replicated and found in several locations across the Sword Coast, in the vicinity of Baldurs Gate, and even in the Black Pits of Underdark. One of these rings could be found in catacombs under Candlekeep as well as in the iron mines of Nashkel in 1368 DR.
A ring of Batalistas Passport could be used along with a regular ring of fire resistance to drastically strengthen enchantments on a Club of Detonation to a powerful +5 variation. The imp named Cespenar knew the secrets of that process.
