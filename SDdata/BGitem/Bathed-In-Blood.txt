'''''Bathed-In-Blood''''' was a [[magic]]al suit of [[plate mail]] armor commissioned by [[Kheros|Kheros the Red]], a [[priest]] of [[Tempus]]. 

==Description==
Powerfully enchanted to withstand most blows in battle, ''Bathed-in-Blood'' was entirely blood red in color.

==History==
As a young man, the warrior Kheros worked as a mercenary, hiring out his services to many adventuring companies. Despite many victories, he developed a crippling phobia of blood over time. He fell into madness, until he was taken in by a group of Tempuran priests who inducted him to their faith. Kheros eventually became a priest of Tempus himself, and after several years was able to conquer his fear by allowing himself to be nearly drowned in a tub of blood. Later in life, Kheros had ''Bathed-In-Blood'' made to commemorate his past.

As of [[1281 DR]], ''Bathed-In-Blood'' was in the possession of the [[fighter]] [[Fleezum]] in [[Icewind Dale]].
