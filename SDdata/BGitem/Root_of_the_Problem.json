        "mainbody": "The Root of the Problem was a magical club that was originally a branch of a tree that was linked to a generous dryad.\nThis +1 club was particularly harmful to giant humanoids, monstrous creatures and the undead.\nThis weapon was very old, dating back centuries before Dale Reckoning when the ancient empire of Netheril collapsed and the great Anauroch desert formed in North Faerûn. As the lush and vibrant lands receded, a lone dryad offered a branch from her tree, creating the root as a gift to the forces that fought on behalf of natures cause.\nIn the centuries since, some less-respectful scholars bestowed the weapons ironic nickname — one not really befitting a weapon formed from a genuine sacrifice that stemmed from feelings of sorrow and hope.\nBy the 14 century DR, the Root of the Problem had come into the possession of a spirit that dwelt within a druid grove in Amn."
