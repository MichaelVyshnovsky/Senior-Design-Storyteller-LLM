        "mainbody": "The '''''Root of the Problem''''' was a [[magic]]al club that was originally a branch of a tree that was linked to a generous [[dryad]].",
        "Powers": "This ''+1 [[club]]'' was particularly harmful to giant [[humanoid]]s, monstrous creatures and the [[undead]].",
        "History": "This weapon was very old, dating back centuries before [[Dale Reckoning]] when the ancient empire of [[Netheril]] collapsed and the great [[Anauroch]] desert formed in [[North Faerûn]]. As the lush and vibrant lands receded, a lone dryad offered a branch from her tree, creating ''the root'' as a gift to the forces that fought on behalf of nature's cause.\n\nIn the centuries since, some less-respectful scholars bestowed the weapon's ironic nickname — one not really befitting a weapon formed from a genuine sacrifice that stemmed from feelings of sorrow and hope.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century DR, the ''Root of the Problem'' had come into the possession of a [[spirit]] that dwelt within a [[druid]] grove in [[Amn]]."
