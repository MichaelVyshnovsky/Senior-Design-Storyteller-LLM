        "mainbody": "'''''Burning Earth''''' was a unique [[flame tongue]] sword.",
        "Description": "The blade of ''Burning Earth'' burned with flames when drawn. The grip was crafted in a manner that was ill-suited for most [[humanoid]]s. When held, it created tension in the wielder's arm, though not enough to impede their skill in combat.\n\nIt bore a mysterious [[rune]] that indicated the sword was empowered by [[Toril]] itself.",
        "Powers": "''Burning Earth'' possessed a ''+1 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' and burned foes with [[magic]]al flame. It was particularly harmful to [[lycanthrope]]s, [[troll]]s, [[winter wolf|winter wolves]], and the [[undead]].",
        "History": "It was unknown who or what created the sword, but legend stated that it was older than the [[Anauroch]] desert.\n\nSome time before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the sword made its way into the basement of [[Durlag's Tower]]."
