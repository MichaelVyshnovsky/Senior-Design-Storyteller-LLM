'''''[[Fortress shield]]''''' was an [[enchanted]] and tall brightly-colored [[shield]] once wielded by [[paladin]] named [[Phil Pious]] before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This heavy shield was as tall as an adult man and possessed a potent defensive ''+4'' enchantment. It also was virtually impregnable to missile attacks on par wit a powerful ''+7'' defensive enchantment.

==History==
This ''fortress shield'' once belonged to a paladin from the [[Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart]], Phil Pious. He gained renowned after wielding his ''fortress shield'' into a battle against [[bow]]-wielding [[hobgoblin]] and [[kobold]] marauders. He alone stood against the army remaining unharmed as they exhausted all ammunition. Subsequently, Phil took the shield to melee and dispatched every single monstrous marauder.

By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Phil's ''fortress shield'' ended up in the hands of [[Ribald Barterman]] of the [[Adventurer Mart]] located in [[Amn]]ian the city of [[Athkatla]].
