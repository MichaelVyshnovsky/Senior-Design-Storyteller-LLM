        "mainbody": "The '''''armor of the viper''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] suit of [[leather armor]] found in [[Faer√ªn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While it provided significant protection against physical attacks, it left the wearer more vulnerable to poison and paralyzation.",
        "History": "The armor got its name not from a monstrous snake or [[:Category:Serpentfolk|serpentfolk]] but rather from the nickname of the [[drow]] [[assassin]], [[Raroh]]. He was renowned for the potent poisons he used in his murders. When he learned of his armor's susceptibility he presented it as a gift to [[Avlorm]], a skilled but novice assassin, who was quickly rising in rank within his guild. When the novice's prowess eventually grew to rival his own, Raroh easily eliminated the threat to his power."
