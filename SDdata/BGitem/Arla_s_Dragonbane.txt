Arlas Dragonbane was an enchanted +3 sling that was used by Arla Surestep.
The halfling adventurer, Arla Surestep, used the magical weapon to slay a green dragon. She fired a bullet through its large skull in mid-flight, felling the creature.
It was rumored that Arla actually slew the dragon by firing the bullet squarely into the creatures buttocks for humor, rather than lethal effect.
* Arla Surestep, whom the weapon was named after.
