'''Arla's Dragonbane''' was an enchanted ''+3'' [[sling]] that was used by [[Arla Surestep]].

==History==
{{fq
|text=It would seem that halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.
|source=Item description from the ''[[Baldur's Gate series]]''
}}
The [[halfling]] adventurer, Arla Surestep, used the [[magic]]al weapon to slay a [[green dragon]]. She fired a [[bullet]] through its large skull in mid-flight, felling the creature.

==Rumors==
It was rumored that Arla actually slew the dragon by firing the bullet squarely into the creature's buttocks for humor, rather than lethal effect.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Arla Surestep]], whom the weapon was named after.
