'''''Ashideena''''' was a [[magic]]al [[warhammer]], named after the brilliant military strategist [[Lady Ashideena]], that dated back to the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This warhammer possessed a ''+2 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' that shocked any person or creature it struck.

==History==
The hammer was originally wielded by [[Dergat Wiltoon]], a grave warrior who served as the Field Captain of Lady Ashideena. The two served together during the entire conflict that surrounded the [[Black Horde]] ravaging the lands of [[the North]], the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Lands of Intrigue]] in the [[1235 DR|Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR]].

Following the war, Lady Ashideena and Dergat fell in love with one another and eventually got married. It was rumored that Dergat named his weapon after his bride as a reminder of their love and how hard he had fought to preserve it in the face of war.

At some point prior to the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]] ''Ashideena'' or its copy came into the possession of the deranged [[Cyric]]ist [[cleric]], [[Bassilus]]. At some point long before [[1368 DR]], another ''Ashideena'' was stashed near a temple dedicated to [[Amaunator]] underneath the [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]] of [[Athkatla]]. Another replica could be found in use around the gladiatorial arena in [[Thay]] run by [[Dennaton]], a [[Red Wizard]].
