The reflection shield was a unique and aptly-named small enchanted shield said to originated from the Myth Rhynn by some accords.
This shield possessed a +1 defensive enchantment. However, its true power was in it reflecting certain types of damage back at the attacker. Virtually all thrown weapons , darts, buttets, arrows, and bolts of mundane and magical nature were reflected back when hitting its surface. Additionally, such spells as flame arrow and magical stone were sent back to their source. Traps like snares and spikes also left the shields wielder unaffected. This shield also protected the wielder from several types of monster missile-like and spell-like abilities.
The reflection shields history was obscured by time. It was used as a wall-mounted decoration from an old festhall. From there, it was abandoned in a shops backroom until it was acquitted to be used as ceremonial armor by a young noble sometime before the . The shields magics became apparent when an attempt on the noblemans life ended in spells being reflected back at the caster. When sages researched this reflection shield, they managed to find connections to the ancient elven city of Myth Rhynn, or possibly to a similarly old site.
In 1369 DR, the reflection shield was sold at Ribald Bartermans Adventurer Mart in Athkatlas Waukeens Promenade.
