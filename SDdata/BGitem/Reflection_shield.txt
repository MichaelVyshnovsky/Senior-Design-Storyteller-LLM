The '''''reflection shield''''' was a unique and aptly-named small [[enchanted]] [[shield]] said to originated from the [[Myth Rhynn]] by some accords.

==Powers==
This shield possessed a ''+1'' defensive enchantment. However, its true power was in it reflecting certain types of damage back at the attacker. Virtually all thrown weapons , [[dart]]s, [[buttet]]s, [[arrow]]s, and [[bolt]]s of mundane and magical nature were reflected back when hitting its surface. Additionally, such [[spell]]s as ''[[flame arrow]]'' and ''[[magical stone]]'' were sent back to their source. Traps like snares and spikes also left the shield's wielder unaffected. This shield also protected the wielder from several types of monster missile-like and spell-like abilities.

==History==
The ''reflection shield's'' history was obscured by time. It was used as a wall-mounted decoration from an old festhall. From there, it was abandoned in a shop's backroom until it was acquitted to be used as ceremonial armor by a young noble sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. The shield's magics became apparent when an attempt on the nobleman's life ended in spells being reflected back at the caster. When sages researched this ''reflection shield,'' they managed to find connections to the ancient [[elven]] city of [[Myth Rhynn]], or possibly to a similarly old site.

In 1369 DR, the ''reflection shield'' was sold at [[Ribald Barterman]]'s [[Adventurer Mart]] in [[Athkatla]]'s [[Waukeen's Promenade]].
