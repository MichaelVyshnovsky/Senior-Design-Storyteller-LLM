'''Glasses of identification''' were [[magic]]al spectacles that allowed the wearer to see other [[magical item]]s as they truly were.

==Description==
After putting the glasses on, the [[command word]]s needed to activate the glasses would appear to float in the wearer's field of vision. When activated they could see any [[Item enchantment|enchantments]], [[curse]]s, or magical effects possessed by a given item.

==History==
One pair of these glasses were known to be offered for sale by [[Arledrian]] of the [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Athkatla]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Another pair was offered for sale by smuggler [[Carras]] of [[Amkethran]] in [[Calimshan]]. These glasses were also sold by vendors at [[Red Wizard]] [[Dennaton]]'s gladiatorial pits in [[Thay]].
