The non-detection was not achieved via illusion and was active as long as the cloak was worn.\nThis magic cloak was believed to be commissioned by the lineage of the most accomplished and infamous burglars in Faer√ªn. The cloaks powers are quite evident considering that the names of its previous owners remained unknown.\nOne such cloak, the original or a replica, was worn by Purvis, the assassin who was hired by the speaker of Lonelywood in the .\nThe clock came into possession of Gurke, an old dwarf who traveled to the Jovial Juggler of Beregost in 1368 DR. On his trek through Cloak Wood he was ambushed and robbed by a band of tasloi. The creatures stole the Whispers of Silence letting the dwarf escape with his life. Serendipitously, Gurke encountered Abdel Adrian and his companions and requested help retrieving his enchanted cloak from the scaly monsters.\nSorcerous Amon owned the Whispers of Silence later the same year. However it was unknown whether the cloak he was selling in the Den of the Seven Vales of Athkatla was the genuine item, or a replica."
