        "Powers": "These wonders of tinkering possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that helped the missiles strike true. Additionally, these heavy crossbows could use any type of [[bolt]] that, before being launched, were covered in [[oil]]. As the bolts were fired, they were lit, dealing additional flame damage to the targets. The weapon itself was also enchanted to remain well oiled and lubricated at all times.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a ''heavy crossbows of searing'' was available for purchase from [[Ribald Barterman]]'s shop – the [[Adventurer Mart]], in [[Athkatla]]'s [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. The same year, another similar weapons was sold at [[Red Wizard]] [[Dennaton]]'s gladiatorial pits in [[Thay]]."
