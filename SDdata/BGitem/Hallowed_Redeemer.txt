The '''Hallowed Redeemer''' was a special [[greatsword|two-handed sword]] owned by the [[paladin]] [[Keldorn Firecam]].

==History==
He received it as a gift from [[Torm]] himself early on in his career, and no-one else could use it. He was wielding it in [[1369 DR]].

A bastard sword called Hallowed Redeemer surfaced in the 1370s DR with a different appearance and a very different enchantment and usable by others. <ref group="note">''[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]'' presents a rather different Hallowed Redeemer to that appearing in the earlier ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'', with different enchantment and appearance, though the same base damage. The in-universe connection between the two swords is unknown.

==Powers==
In addition to being a very accurate ''+2 sword'', the Hallowed Redeemer protected Keldorn with a special magic that harmed anyone harming him while he wielded the sword, as a manifestation of Torm's wrath.

The other Hallowed Redeemer was a ''+3 [[bane (property)|undead bane]] [[bastard sword]]''.
