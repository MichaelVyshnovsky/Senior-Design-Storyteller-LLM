The Hallowed Redeemer was a special two-handed sword owned by the paladin Keldorn Firecam.
He received it as a gift from Torm himself early on in his career, and no-one else could use it. He was wielding it in 1369 DR.
A bastard sword called Hallowed Redeemer surfaced in the 1370s DR with a different appearance and a very different enchantment and usable by others. Neverwinter Nights 2 presents a rather different Hallowed Redeemer to that appearing in the earlier Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn, with different enchantment and appearance, though the same base damage. The in-universe connection between the two swords is unknown.
In addition to being a very accurate +2 sword, the Hallowed Redeemer protected Keldorn with a special magic that harmed anyone harming him while he wielded the sword, as a manifestation of Torms wrath.
The other Hallowed Redeemer was a +3 undead bane bastard sword.
