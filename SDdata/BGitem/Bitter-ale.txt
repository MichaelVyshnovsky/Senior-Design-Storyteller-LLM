'''Bitter-ale''' was a variety of strong dark [[ale]] brewed by the [[duergar]] inhabitants of the [[Underdark]] in [[northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Bitter -le was typically stored in kegs. It was notably dark in color and had a thick, strong, and unpleasant flavor. Its foul taste and potency could make even the stoutest of northern [[gold dwarves]] grimace.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, many [[barrel]]s of bitter-ale were stored in a small duergar stronghold under the [[Spine of the World]], as [[Barud Barzam]]'s duergar were preparing to reclaim the [[Black Raven River]], which long before itself was a duergar fortress in ages past.
