Bitter-ale was a variety of strong dark ale brewed by the duergar inhabitants of the Underdark in northwest Faer√ªn.
Bitter -le was typically stored in kegs. It was notably dark in color and had a thick, strong, and unpleasant flavor. Its foul taste and potency could make even the stoutest of northern gold dwarves grimace.
Circa the , many barrels of bitter-ale were stored in a small duergar stronghold under the Spine of the World, as Barud Barzams duergar were preparing to reclaim the Black Raven River, which long before itself was a duergar fortress in ages past.
