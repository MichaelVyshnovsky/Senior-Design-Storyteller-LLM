They were often worn by clerics and paladins of benevolent deities.\nThese gauntlets were commonly used among members of the Order of the Radiant Heart, who would bestow them upon their novice members who had not yet learned how to cast divine magic. It was considered an honor for those outside of the paladin to be gifted a pair of these magic gauntlets."
