        "mainbody": "A storm star was a old variety of magical morning star that was believed to have originated from the ancient empire of Netheril.\nWhile there were a number of individual storm star weapons in existence, as of the 14 century DR, they were varied in their form and design. Commonly, they were among the largest and most heavy designs of morning stars.\nThe majority of them were forged of steel, and plated in electrum. By treating a storm star with starfall ore, the enchantment of the weapon could be raised beyond others of its kind.\nThis weapon allowed its wielder to unleash bolts of lightning that struck multiple foes, a power that was referred to as a battle bolt.\nIt was worth between 1,500 and 15,000 gold pieces.\nAs of the , one of these weapons could be found within the Machine of Lum the Mad within Watchers Keep in Tethyr.\n* Oblayna Stormrider, the matriarch of the Emmert family of Longsaddle."
