        "mainbody": "A '''''storm star''''' was a old variety of [[magic]]al [[morning star]] that was believed to have originated from the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].",
        "Description": "While there were a number of individual ''storm star'' weapons in existence, as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they were varied in their form and design. Commonly, they were among the largest and most heavy designs of morning stars.\n\nThe majority of them were forged of [[steel]], and plated in [[electrum]]. By treating a ''storm star'' with [[star metal|starfall ore]], the [[Item enchantment|enchantment]] of the weapon could be raised beyond others of its kind.",
        "Powers": "This weapon allowed its wielder to unleash bolts of lightning that struck multiple foes, a power that was referred to as a ''[[battle bolt]]''.\n\nIt was worth between 1,500 and 15,000 gold pieces.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, one of these weapons could be found within the [[Machine of Lum the Mad]] within [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Tethyr]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Oblayna Stormrider]], the matriarch of the Emmert family of [[Longsaddle]]."
