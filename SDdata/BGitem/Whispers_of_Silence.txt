The '''''Whispers of Silence''''' was a unique ''[[cloak of non-detection]]'' that veiled its wearer from magical ways of detection.

==Powers==
The ''Whispers of Silence'' was enchanted to render its wearer completely undetectable by magical means, such as ''[[true seeing]]'' and invisible to creatures that possessed ''true sight'', when hidden in shadows or under the effects of the spell of ''invisibility''. The non-detection was not achieved via ''[[illusion]]'' and was active as long as the cloak was worn.

==History==
This magic [[cloak]] was believed to be commissioned by the lineage of the most accomplished and infamous burglars in [[Faer√ªn]]. The cloak's powers are quite evident considering that the names of its previous owners remained unknown.

One such cloak, the original or a replica, was worn by [[Purvis]], the assassin who was hired by the speaker of [[Lonelywood]] in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}.

The clock came into possession of [[Gurke]], an old [[dwarf]] who traveled to the [[Jovial Juggler]] of [[Beregost]] in [[1368 DR]]. On his trek through [[Cloak Wood]] he was ambushed and robbed by a band of [[tasloi]]. The creatures stole the ''Whispers of Silence'' letting the dwarf escape with his life. Serendipitously, Gurke encountered [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions and requested help retrieving his enchanted cloak from the scaly monsters.

[[Amon (mage)|Sorcerous Amon]] owned the ''Whispers of Silence'' later the same year. However it was unknown whether the cloak he was selling in the [[Den of the Seven Vales]] of [[Athkatla]] was the genuine item, or a replica.
