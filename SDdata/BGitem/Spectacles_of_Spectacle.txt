The '''''Spectacles of Spectacle''''' were a pair of magical spectacles crafted by the [[wizard]] [[Perriavor]]. They allowed their wearer to see and interact with beings from other planes.

==Description==
The ''Spectacles of Spectacle'' resembled a normal pair of spectacles, but were colored green and looked unusually ornate.

==Powers==
Wearing the ''Spectacles'' allowed a person to see beings from a wide variety of other planes. These beings could then be pulled into the [[Prime Material Plane]] and interacted with. Additionally, the ''Spectacles'' made their wearer more resistant to&mdash;and aware of&mdash;[[illusion]] magic.

;Beings Discernible Through the ''Spectacles''Although ten beings are listed here, the ''Spectacles'' were limited to three charges, meaning the player character's of ''Siege of Dragonspear'' could only have pulled three of them into the Prime Material Plane.

*[[Al-Alai]], a [[fire elemental]] in Elfsong Tavern.
*A [[gauth]] along the [[Coast Way]].
*A greater [[shadow]] in a [[bugbear]] den in the [[Forest of Wyrms]].
*[[Nazramu]], a [[djinni]] merchant.
*The [[tiefling]] [[Raeanndra]], and a greater [[earth elemental]], near [[Dead Man's Pass]].
*[[Vidyadhar]], a [[rakshasa]] in the caverns below [[Dragonspear Castle]].
*[[Zhadroth]], a [[lich]] imprisoned in [[Kanaglym]].
*[[Idyletia]], a [[solar]] in [[Avernus]].
*[[Xhost]], a [[demon]] in Avernus.

==History==
The ''Spectacles'' were crafted by Perriavor, a [[gnome]] wizard with a tendency towards wanderlust. Perriavor's intention was to use the ''Spectacles'' to interview extraplanar beings so he could find safe locations to cross over into their planes. Unfortunately for Perriavor, he disappeared after being tricked by a [[devil]] into performing an unsafe shift to [[Phlegethos]], leaving only the ''Spectacles'' behind.

By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the ''Spectacles'' were in the hands of [[Zaviak]], a [[human]] wizard who acquired them from a "giant gnome" in [[Sigil]]. Zaviak used the magical spectacles to go on a "vision quest," but ended up confused and "freaked out" in [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Elfsong Tavern]] (he himself believed he was in a tavern in the [[sewers of Waterdeep]]).

==Notable Owners==
*[[Perriavor]], the gnome wizard who crafted the ''Spectacles''.
*[[Zaviak]], a human wizard on a "vision quest."
