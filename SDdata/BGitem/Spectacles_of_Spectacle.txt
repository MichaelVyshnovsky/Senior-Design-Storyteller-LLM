The Spectacles of Spectacle were a pair of magical spectacles crafted by the wizard Perriavor. They allowed their wearer to see and interact with beings from other planes.
The Spectacles of Spectacle resembled a normal pair of spectacles, but were colored green and looked unusually ornate.
Wearing the Spectacles allowed a person to see beings from a wide variety of other planes. These beings could then be pulled into the Prime Material Plane and interacted with. Additionally, the Spectacles made their wearer more resistant to&mdashand aware of&mdashillusion magic.
Beings Discernible Through the SpectaclesAlthough ten beings are listed here, the Spectacles were limited to three charges, meaning the player characters of Siege of Dragonspear could only have pulled three of them into the Prime Material Plane.
*Al-Alai, a fire elemental in Elfsong Tavern.
*A gauth along the Coast Way.
*A greater shadow in a bugbear den in the Forest of Wyrms.
*Nazramu, a djinni merchant.
*The tiefling Raeanndra, and a greater earth elemental, near Dead Mans Pass.
*Vidyadhar, a rakshasa in the caverns below Dragonspear Castle.
*Zhadroth, a lich imprisoned in Kanaglym.
*Idyletia, a solar in Avernus.
*Xhost, a demon in Avernus.
The Spectacles were crafted by Perriavor, a gnome wizard with a tendency towards wanderlust. Perriavors intention was to use the Spectacles to interview extraplanar beings so he could find safe locations to cross over into their planes. Unfortunately for Perriavor, he disappeared after being tricked by a devil into performing an unsafe shift to Phlegethos, leaving only the Spectacles behind.
By the , the Spectacles were in the hands of Zaviak, a human wizard who acquired them from a "giant gnome" in Sigil. Zaviak used the magical spectacles to go on a "vision quest," but ended up confused and "freaked out" in Baldurs Gates Elfsong Tavern (he himself believed he was in a tavern in the sewers of Waterdeep).
