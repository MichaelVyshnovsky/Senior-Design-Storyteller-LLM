        "mainbody": "'''''Discipliners''''' were ''[[curse]]d'' [[ring]]s fashioned after the ''[[Ring of folly|rings of folly]]'' in [[Narfell]].",
        "Description": "''Discipliners'' were metallic bands with a round hollow circle in its center, reminiscent of a ring with a missing impeded [[gem]]stone.",
        "Powers": "Just like ''rings of folly'', ''Discipliners'' magically and drastically reduced the wearer's natural intelligence and wisdom, rendering them drooling idiots and affected them with the ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell. These rings could only be removed with the ''[[remove curse]]'' spell, or by a capable [[cleric]].",
        "History": "''Discipliners'' were created by [[Hergal Norin]] of Narfell. The [[wizard]] used these rings to discipline his most egotistical students. He presented a ''Discipliner'' to a student for their \"obvious brilliance\" to teach them a lesson in humility.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], several of these rings could be found on the [[Sword Coast]]. A mad sage [[Arcand]] sought to recover a ''Discipliner'' from a certain shipwreck to the south from [[Baldur's Gate]] for one deluded reason or the other. Another ring was in the lair of the ''cursed'' [[spider]]-woman of the [[Cloak Wood]], [[Centeol]]. And lastly, one more of these [[enchanted]] rings was in possession of a [[djinni]] merchant [[Khan Zahraa]] in [[Trademeet]] on a hunt for a [[rakshasa]]. Khan was ready to \"reward\" an unhelpful adventurer with the ''cursed'' ring."
