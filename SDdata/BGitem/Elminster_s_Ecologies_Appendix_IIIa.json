        "Description": "Physically, copies of the book were old and time-worn, representing tomes. ''Elminster's Ecologies Appendix IIIa'' was part of a larger collection of books, ''[[Elminster's Ecologies (in-universe)|Elminster's Ecologies]]''.\n\nThe content of the ecological manual explained rare and strange creatures around the vast continent of [[Faer√ªn]], some of them breeds of existing creatures. Elminster wrote descriptions of such creatures, as well as how to defeat them, if encountered. The following creatures were detailed in the appendix: [[dense pudding]]s, [[fire troll]]s, [[fission slime]]s, [[magic golem]]s and [[marilith]]s.\n\nMany chests and bookshelves around [[Watcher's Keep]] kept copies of the guides, as the keep itself teemed with a huge variety of rare creatures."
