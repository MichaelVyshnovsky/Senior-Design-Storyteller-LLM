        "mainbody": "piders Bane was a magical greatsword.\nIn addition to being a powerfully enchanted blade, Spiders Bane also protected its wielder from effects that affected movement, such as the spell web.\nSpiders Bane was crafted by dwarves from Clan Orothiar, based out of the Cloakwood. The greatsword was gifted to the Council of Four, the ruling body of Baldurs Gate, for the purpose of fostering goodwill between the two organizations. The Grand Dukes of Baldurs Gate wielded Spiders Bane for a century, but it was eventually lost in a fight againt ettercaps and spiders.\nIn the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Chelak and his brother Tiber found Spiders Bane. Aware of the swords powers, and seeking fame and fortune, they sought to clear out a  giant spider colony in the Cloakwood. Chelak went into the colony alone, where he ended up killed by spiders. Tiber, distraught at his brothers disappearance, lingered in the forest for over a week, seeking adventurers who could find Chelak for him. He eventually encountered Gorions Ward, who returned Chelaks body to Tiber. Overcome with grief, Chelak gave Spiders Bane to the Ward."
