        "mainbody": "'''''Keryvian''''' (also known as '''Foebane''' or '''Demron's Bane''') was one of the [[Baneblades of Demron]], variously described as a mighty hand-and-a-half [[broadsword]] or one-handed [[bastard sword]].",
        "Description": "''Keryvian''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s blade glowed with a blue fire when drawn, which was bright enough to read by, and the hilt bore the likeness of a [[blue dragon]] with teeth clutching the blade.",
        "Powers": "''Keryvian'' was imbued with properties that made its blade magically [[keen]], allowed the wielder to [[jump]] and [[featherfall|fall gently]] over large distances, and allowed the wielder to set a magical proximity alarm. The sword could also reflect back [[magic]] cast at it or its wielder.\n\nThe sword could be commanded to \"guard\" and would wait until anyone who was not the owner touched it, at which point it began attacking that individual and making a very loud singing noise.\n\nOnly a capable warrior of good heart could take up ''Keryvian''. Like all of the Baneblades of Demron, ''Keryvian'' was a powerful magic sword that was imbued with holy energy and that was particularly effective against [[outsider]]s, [[undead]], and any evil-aligned creatures, \"burning\" the life (or unlife) out of them.\n\nBut ''Foebane''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> full power was only realized when it was combined with Fflar's scabbard, which was also magical. Without it, the sword was simply a ''+3'' blade and did extra damage against all [[undead]], [[shapeshifter]]s, and [[outsider]]s. Combining the two was not simply done, though, and required special means. With the scabbard, the sword grew stronger, to ''+5''; enhanced the wielder's physical and mental resilience; and it drained life as with ''[[Larloch's minor drain]]'' from those it struck .\n\nThe value of the sword as of [[1368 DR]] was estimated at 35,000 [[gold piece]]s.",
        "History": "''Keryvian'' was crafted by the archmage [[Demron]] before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], and was considered the greatest of his series of Baneblades. The blade was used by a thief to kill Demron, hence the name \"Demron's Bane\".\n\nIt was once carried by [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]].\n\nAs of [[1368 DR]], it was in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]],\n\nBy [[1374 DR]] it was in the possession of [[Seiveril Miritar]]. He kept it at [[Seamist]] in northern [[Evermeet]], where it decorated a wall for a time, until Fflar was resurrected and took up the sword once more."
