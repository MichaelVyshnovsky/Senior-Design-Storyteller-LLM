        "mainbody": "Keryvian (also known as Foebane or Demrons Bane) was one of the Baneblades of Demron, variously described as a mighty hand-and-a-half broadsword or one-handed bastard sword.\nKeryvians blade glowed with a blue fire when drawn, which was bright enough to read by, and the hilt bore the likeness of a blue dragon with teeth clutching the blade.\nKeryvian was imbued with properties that made its blade magically keen, allowed the wielder to jump and fall gently over large distances, and allowed the wielder to set a magical proximity alarm. The sword could also reflect back magic cast at it or its wielder.\nThe sword could be commanded to \"guard\" and would wait until anyone who was not the owner touched it, at which point it began attacking that individual and making a very loud singing noise.\nOnly a capable warrior of good heart could take up Keryvian. Like all of the Baneblades of Demron, Keryvian was a powerful magic sword that was imbued with holy energy and that was particularly effective against outsiders, undead, and any evil-aligned creatures, \"burning\" the life (or unlife) out of them.\nBut Foebanes full power was only realized when it was combined with Fflars scabbard, which was also magical. Without it, the sword was simply a +3 blade and did extra damage against all undead, shapeshifters, and outsiders. Combining the two was not simply done, though, and required special means. With the scabbard, the sword grew stronger, to +5 enhanced the wielders physical and mental resilience and it drained life as with Larlochs minor drain from those it struck .\nThe value of the sword as of 1368 DR was estimated at 35,000 gold pieces.\nKeryvian was crafted by the archmage Demron before the fall of Myth Drannor, and was considered the greatest of his series of Baneblades. The blade was used by a thief to kill Demron, hence the name \"Demrons Bane\".\nIt was once carried by Fflar Starbrow Melruth.\nAs of 1368 DR, it was in the ruins of Myth Drannor,\nBy 1374 DR it was in the possession of Seiveril Miritar. He kept it at Seamist in northern Evermeet, where it decorated a wall for a time, until Fflar was resurrected and took up the sword once more."
