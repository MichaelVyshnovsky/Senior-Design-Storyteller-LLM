'''''Blackrazor''''' was a [[sword]] with powerful enchantments but an [[evil]] nature.

==Description==
The sword radiated [[evil]] and gave its wielder the sense that perhaps it was really controlling them.

==Powers==
''Blackrazor'' was a ''+3 [[longsword]]''. When wielded, it bestowed regeneration and immunity to [[charm]] and [[fear]] magic. It had a chance with each hit to drain the target's life force and convert it into healing energy and a temporary boost of speed and strength for the wielder.

==History==
When [[Abdel Adrian]] entered the [[Pocket Plane (Baldur's Gate)|pocket plane]] of [[Bhaal]]'s [[Throne of Blood]] for the first time they faced a number of trials. During the "test of greed" Abdel could turn ''Blackrazor'' over to an enslaved [[genie]], or keep the blade and use it to slay him.
