Blackrazor was a sword with powerful enchantments but an evil nature.
The sword radiated evil and gave its wielder the sense that perhaps it was really controlling them.
Blackrazor was a +3 longsword. When wielded, it bestowed regeneration and immunity to charm and fear magic. It had a chance with each hit to drain the targets life force and convert it into healing energy and a temporary boost of speed and strength for the wielder.
When Abdel Adrian entered the pocket plane of Bhaals Throne of Blood for the first time they faced a number of trials. During the "test of greed" Abdel could turn Blackrazor over to an enslaved genie, or keep the blade and use it to slay him.
