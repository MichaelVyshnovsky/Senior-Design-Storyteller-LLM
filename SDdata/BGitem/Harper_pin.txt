'''''Harper pins''''', also called '''harp pins''', were [[enchanted]] brooches worn by members of the [[Harpers]]. Two main types were known, '''''lesser''''' and '''''greater'''''; the greater was often considered the standard ''Harper pin''.

==Description==
Both ''lesser'' and ''greater Harper pins'' were typically made of [[silver]]. a crescent [[moon]] and [[harp]]. ''Circa'' 1479 DR, ''Harper pins'' were often appeared to be cheap, somewhat tarnished common brooches.

==Powers==
===Lesser Pins===
The ''lesser Harper pin'' bestowed on the wearer the same abilities as a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]'', that is, shielding them from ''[[detect lies]]'' and ''[[detect thoughts]]'', as well as any magical effect that would reveal their [[alignment]].<ref>

===Greater Pins===
A more heavily enchanted version, the standard or ''greater Harper pin'' provided the wearer with significant protection against specific hazards.

First, it greatly aided the wearer in resisting [[charm]] and [[enchantment]] spells and similar [[psionics]] or in other terms all mind-affecting magic and effects. Moreover, it completely  shielded against magical and psionic attempts to read the wearer's mind or their alignment, granting the effect of an ''[[undetectable alignment]]'' spell.

Next, it shielded the wearer from being [[scry]]ed or detected by magical means, effectively granting a permanent ''[[nondetection]]'' effect. The wearer was simply "not there." Similarly, the ''Harper pin'' itself could not be detected, though a ''[[locate object]]'' targeting another item in the wearer's possession would still function.

Finally, it protected the wearer from all ''[[magic missile]]s'' and granted a permanent ''[[resist elements]]'' versus electricity. It absorbed the energy into itself.

The silver used in ''greater'' pins was magically treated to be [[everbright]] so would never tarnish and to make it as hard as [[steel]] or even [[adamantine]]. Resistant to many effects, it could not be damaged by magical attacks.

Anyone could wear a ''Harper pin'', as they did not need attuning to their wearer and were not made to be attuned to specific members. However, if an [[evil]] creature should happen to wear a ''greater Harper pin'', then some of them would turn black and produce loud and discordant jangling sounds, similar to a metal-stringed harp being played badly and even angrily. Naturally, this made it hard for the miscreant to sneak about. This continued until the villainous wearer removed it, after which it would quickly return to its normal hue.

===Late 1400s Pins===

''Harper pins'' in use in Neverwinter ''circa'' 1479 DR carried one, two, or three blessings from the goddesses: [[Lliira]], goddess of joy; [[Mielikki]], goddess of rangers; and [[Tymora]], goddess of luck. Beginner Harpers had access to one of their choice, experienced Harpers two, and veteran Harpers all three. These blessings protected the wearer from harm or aided them against a foe. Lliira bestowed joy and grace to help a Harper strike surely, lest they miss in an attack; Mielikki granted endurance to pain, so they could shrug off an injury; and Tymora gave luck to help them evade ill effects and magic. Furthermore, if injured, the wearer received a healing boon from their ''Harper pin''.

===Special Pins===
Some Harpers had pins with special powers. For example, [[Obslin Minstrelwish]] of [[Twilight Hall]] had one with the power of [[telekinesis]], giving him the power to shift up to {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}} of materials.

===Related Powers===
The reading of a ''[[Scroll of the Harpers]]'' would turn all ''Harper pins'' in range into real magical harps.<ref> A ''Harper pin'' was also the only magic item left unaffected by the playing of ''[[Jolora's harp]]''.<ref>

==Usage==
Standard ''Harper pins'' were used by many senior members of the Harpers and by the Master Harpers, who, if they did not have one on their person, could readily acquire one. when needing to be recognized by other Harpers, Given the risk of Harper enemies finding them out, they usually kept their ''Harper pins'' hidden beneath their clothes or under their trims, inside [[gloves]] or [[sash]]es, or in special [[pouch]]es inside their [[boots]] or [[bracer]]s.<ref> Nevertheless, some, like [[Mari Al'maren]], would wear them openly and proudly on their collar when they could<ref> and the Harper [[druid]] [[Galvin]] showed his even when [[wild shape]]d, with it appearing as a silvery crescent moon marking on his fur or feathers.<ref> It was also not necessary to wear a ''Harper pin'', particularly if the Harper in question had no true body, such as the [[firetail]] known as [[Flamedancer]].<ref>

In addition to their magical protections, Harper pins could be used to prove one's affiliation with the order or to gain favor with their sympathizers.<ref><ref> They were practically a necessity for non-[[elves]] to enter Evereska.<ref>

Furthermore, ''Harper pins'' functioned as keys that would bypass the magical wards of Harper caches and safehouses, as strongholds and storehouses.

==Creation==
Requiring quality craftsmanship and a high level of expertise in [[item enchantment]], fashioning a ''Harper pin'' called for training in the making of [[magic item]]s and an array of spells, including ''[[nondetection]]'', ''[[protection from elements]]'', ''[[resistance]]'', ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]'', and ''[[undetectable alignment]]'', as well as ''[[detect evil]]'' and ''[[ghost sound]]'' (only required for those that turned black). Notably, it was blessed by no less than three goddesses: Lliira, Mielikki, and Tymora.

Creators were often specialized in such unique Harper items as these.{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|8}} The smiths who crafted ''Harper pins'' worked in secret and only provided them to certain senior Harpers they knew well, not to anyone who came around seeking them. ''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], they were based in [[Deepingdale]], [[Evereska]], [[Everlund]], [[Evermeet]], [[High Horn]], [[Lyrabar]], [[Mintarn]], [[Neverwinter]], [[Shadowdale]], [[Silverymoon]], [[Starmantle]], and [[Waterdeep]]. One was [[Jhenna Iliathor]], at the [[Leaves of Learning]] temple in [[Highmoon]], Deepingdale.

New members of the Harpers were granted a ''lesser Harper pin'' only after joining the order Nevertheless, this could be a personal affairâ€”[[Bran Skorlsun]] sponsored his daughter [[Arilyn Moonblade]] and gave her his own pin.<ref> On occasion, a dying Harper had granted their pin and an unfinished quest to another, and that person could ultimately be accepted. Merely bestowing one with a witness was enough to mark one as a fellow Harper, as when [[Finder Wyvernspur]], a founding member of the Harpers, gave his ''Harper pin'' to [[Olive Ruskettle]], the so-called first [[halfling]] [[bard]].<ref><ref> 

The market price for a ''lesser'' pin was 8,000 [[gp]]. The simpler ''Harper pins'' of 1479 DR were valued at only 680 gp, but were no less treasured by their users.

Bearing great power and significance,

==History==
The first harp pins were crafted by [[Elminster]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]] in the first century after the Harpers' re-founding in the {{YearlinkName|1022}}. Their pair appointed certain members as Master Harpers via dreams bestowed on them by [[Mystra]] then provided directions that led these Harpers to a cache of harp pins in [[Gochall's Tomb]], which were arranged in a crescent atop the stone slab. Later dreams bade them to find skilled smiths and wizards to make more of them and that all true Harpers, and only true Harpers, should have them.

The murderous [[Amril Zoar]] of Waterdeep somehow acquired numerous ''Harper pins'' on which he layered no end of enchantments to use as traps.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}} he slew [[Masked Lord]]s [[Resengar]]{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|126|9}} and [[Tamaeril Bladesemmer]]{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|115-120|7}} in the same night, and left a ''Harper pin'' on Resengar.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|148-152|9}} This pin was later examined by [[Laeral Silverhand]], who was nearly blown to bits by a trap laid on it.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|153-156|10}} In the same night, Amril used a ''[[gate]]'' to rush into the [[Yawning Portal]] but before he could attack [[Durnan]] he was fought back into the portal by [[Tamsil Dryndilstann]] and [[Mhaere Dryndilstann]], dropped another trapped ''Harper pin'' before he left.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|157-165|10}}

When the [[Moonstars]] split from the Harpers in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, they stopped using their Harper pins and adopted [[Teukiir badge]]s instead.{{Cite dragon/335/New Olamn Bard College|26}}

Following the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the Harpers became legend, and it became popular for adventurous nobles of [[Waterdeep]] to don fake Harper pins. The situation became so bad that, by [[1486 DR]], High Harper [[Tam Zawad]] discouraged the wearing of Harper pins altogether among his agents, warning that if they were captured, then the pins would be easily discovered and stolen. Instead, it became increasingly common for Waterdhavian Harpers to wear magical [[tattoo]]s instead, which could be concealed or displayed by uttering a secret phrase. Despite this, a few traditionalists still favored their pins.<ref>{{Cite dragon/430/The Harpers of Waterdeep|38}}

In the mid-1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the ex-Harper bard [[Edgin Darvis]] led his team of thieves to [[Korinn's Keep]], a Harper stronghold filled with [[magic item]]s seized from their villainous enemies. For this robbery, he donned his old Harper uniform, [[cloak]], and ''Harper pin'', which was needed to pass the magical ward and gain admittance to the building. It glowed as it did so.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}
