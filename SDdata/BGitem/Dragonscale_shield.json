Some shields featured the scales of a single specimen, while others were composed of dragon hide adorned with scales of different hues.\nSimilar to their varied appearances, these shields held enchantments of different levels and offered a number of different powers or boons.\nSeveral dragonscale shields crafted from the scales of chromatic dragons offered protection from various elements. \nA brown dragonscale shield offered the wielder protection from acid, while a blue dragonscale shield did the same for lightning and electricity.\nThese shields were considered to be among the best armaments available to those who took up the profession of dragon-slaying.\nThe great smithy Darson crafted the Bulwark of the Great Dragon from the remains of an unnamed ancient wyrm.\nA warlock by the name of Wormsor used the scales of three different dragons to make a shield that resembled the visage of an ancient dragon.
