Scimitars of speed, also known as Belm
Scimitars of speed were marked by their creator Taka Kobe, making them somewhat easier to identify than other magic items. His blades, including these scimitars, were masterfully crafted to have the perfect balance, light as a robins wing and quick as gnomish wit.
These scimitars bore a +2 or +4 enchantment as well as vibrated with each slash, dealing additional sonic damage to their targets. Additionally, these weapons granted their wielder the effects of the haste.
By the late 14 century DR, scimitars of speed were a somewhat common sight along the Sword Coast, and the Moonsea, traveling from Kara-Tur in the hands of adventurers. Even so, many still sought these blades for their collections or more practical use.
In 1368 DR, one such scimitar could be found in Ogres Tower, not far from the Druid Grove outside of Trademeet of Amn.
